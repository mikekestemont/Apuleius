went to philly with shane today! funfunfun  tonight who knows...  tomorrow is gonna be a blockbuster night=\ i have to permanently quit there soon or i'll go crazy! especially since i have an internship 5 days a week AND especially since everyone else left/is leaving, too... (even poor van who's working there as i'm typing this..)  rachel got back from ireland/england yesterday! yay!
i'm off to  urlLink vanessa 's house! and then new brunswick till sunday..
weird thing happened today.. i got on the PATH train to come home and a girl i was friends in high school, danielle, was on it with her boyfriend! i haven't seen her in so long! probably cause she changed schools before senior year and moved to california. anyways, she's so super nice and it was really nice seeing her=)  oh and it's so hot that the pavement in new york feels cushiony under your feet..or as one of the producers where i work, dave, said a 'soft pavement' day! bleck!  5 day weekend here i come=)
yesterday i learned how to be a cameraman.   today i visited the kinko's at 24th & 7th too many times in the heat and then came home to clean my room ( fun !)
ARG
what the hell am i doing?!!
this is my first post and i don't know if i'm doing this right..( urlLink rachel , where are you!?!.... oh yeah , london=p!) so this is just a test (van you know how it goes!)
my mommy made me choco chip & peanut butter pancakes for lunch=) then i went and found out that drum lessons are only 16 bucks each-so i'm gonna start next week!!  in a half hour or somethin i'm gonna go to new brunswick
ok i figured out how to change the color (as you can see)!!   do you think this is too pink?? did you like orange better?   let me know on my message board
ack!
you guys have to hear the 'meow' song...it's on one of the cds of music used for promos and commercials at work that me and the other intern in the creative services department (cece) have to go through.... but for some reason i have ymca in my head....probably b/c i've had to look for a disco song like it for the past couple days (hence finding the meow song).....  also, it's annoying that this thing is orangy-peach on other computers when on herbie it's pink! when i get up enough motivation i'll change it.  oh yeah and i'm going to new brunswick tomorrow-yay!
I am  SO  sad!!!!!  I just finished  Return of the King , so now I am completely done with the  Lord of the Rings  series. (sob sob) I know I sound kinda dumb, but you have to understand! I got  so  into that whole world-I mean with school and stuff it took a long time to read it, so it's been there everytime I'm reading or i'm bored or i'm procrastinating or with me on train rides-I feel literally very very sad that it's all over =*(! I'm gonna miss my Frodo and Gandalf and Shadowfax and Sam and everything else. sigh  Anyways, I was gonna  finally  start  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire , but I left it at school. So i'm gonna start  Deborah Harry  now instead! =)
aye yi yi..back to work and stuff..i don't think i'll be able to do the comments thing, or at least for awhile, cause they are temporarily not accepting new signups....so use the message board for all that stuff.. i'm also still trying to put together my small picture section whenever i have a free moment. i'm gonna do something better with that as soon as i can as well.  today at work i forgot my  favorite  pen was in my back pocket and it fell in the toilet  AFTER  i had peed =(! tomorrow at work i bet i see a cleaning lady with my pen!
i went to the dentist today..no cavaties for once in my life! ......and i got new floss and a new brush-yay! but everyone there thought i was 15 so that was crappy.  i wanna put more on this thing but i'm still figuring out what to do and how to do it.. urlLink rachel  told me how to get a comments thing up so i should do that soon. any other ideas?   dinner with the family tonight-it's my parent's 30th anniversary =)  i'm gonna go play with kiwi now!
this weekend was fun...van took me to veggie works and when we got all the way there it was closed..dan got  drank ..went to philly with shane..silence of the lambs..twilight zone marathon( woo! ) with van until it started getting daylight..mike smelled his armpits..blockbuster(oh wait that wasn't fun)..and a pound of macaroni salad in my tummy!  who could ask for more?  now i'm home where i go online..go to work..read..eat..poop..and sleep.. yay.

i can't even post about last night. there is way too much to say. i'm sure you've all heard some portion of it at least!  (i  did  take polaroids and they will be up soon!)
so today i did nothing at work....fun! i finished my book,  Deborah Harry , on the PATH home..i'm still in disbelief about last night by the way...i'm like oh wow i saw Deborah Harry and Chris Stein and all of Blondie right in front of me!  ...i have  Rock Lobster  in my head=) By the way, you know what sucks?? I wanted to buy a Blondie shirt last night so badly and when I got there they were 40 bucks! That's basically how much i had to pay for the ticket!! =(! anyone love me enough to go to  urlLink their website  and buy me one????=)  i'm gonna feed kiwi and finally start  Goblet of Fire  ...
