Here's a link to an  urlLink article I liked  about blogging--it's funny that because I'm making this, I'm also interested in the ideas that come out of the blog idea.  So I'm behind in the game, but the blog is all about me, right?
The question is, who's reading?  And does that matter?
I'm going to publish a manifesto.  It's going to be meaningful, and maybe I'll just post it here...
Google Answers is a great idea.  I just paid five dollars to have the  urlLink following question  answered:  This is a question about time zones, and it's pretty dry stuff, but the significant thing about it is that somebody was able to answer me within a couple hours, and that was with a clarification!  And I guess that was cool because people actually are out there, waiting for me to ask that question.  And I had researched it for a couple hours, and it was worth five bucks.  I tell you, this is the future of the Internet.  Or something like that.  Here's the general link to  urlLink google answers .  I feel kinda bad mentioning this stuff, because Google bought Blogspot.  So there's a little corporate shame there, but still, Google is pretty much one of the coolest things ever to hit the Net.
I've got a few minutes, and why not post something that no one will read?  In class today my professor, Raisa Vulfovna Solovyova, talked about the GULAG.  What a shock to listen to all that.  You've heard plenty about Nazi camps, but you don't hear too much about the Russian GULAG that  predates  the German camps, that well exceeded the casualties of the German camps, and obviously, that was better hidden from the world.  Even Solzhenitzen's works didn't do the trick, and if you see a special on the History channel about concentration camps, their almost always going to be German.  Part of that, I think, is that when the Allied forces broke the German regime during WWII, the cameras were right behind them.  Cameras have never been able to capture that much detail from the GULAG.  I'm not a historian, and so my perspective may be skewed in one direction or another, but there's something to be said for this less-noticed-but-more-atrocious part of world history.  It takes conscious effort to continually remember that the work camps are a part of our not-so-distant past, and that there is plenty of room for depravity in the world.  It's scary to remember that the participants were normal people, caught up in a system that tyrants created.  There is no guarantee that this type of thing couldn't happen again.  According to Professor Solovyova, this is the type of prison that exists now primarily in Russia, partly because of the expense required to maintain a regular prison.  It's crazy to think that there are still people freezing in the mines of Kolyma, reportedly the worst of all the work camps, where Shalamov spent his internment, and based on which he wrote his  Kolyma Stories .  I'm new to all this, but there's so much to think about, and so much to learn for how to avoid these types of atrocities in the future.
So let's talk a little bit about the idea that people write and they don't ever get read.  I wonder how it must have been for Mandelshtam, for Tsvetaeva, for Shalamov, to deal with knowing that what you have so carefully protected over the course of your life (be it protection provided by yourself or by your close ones) might be destroyed tomorrow, or that you might always have it around, but that you'll never succeed in getting it published.  So much stood in their way to having the kind of exposure they now have, and how did they deal with that?  And that brings up the personal side of the question: how do I muster the faith to write when I have zero guarantee that anyone will read it, much less get it published?  You might be saying, "Fool, you must purify your intentions for the writing itself, and that will eliminate the need to have other people read it."  I've thought of that, and I can't see myself progressing to that point any time soon.  But maybe that's what happened with the people who had to really endure before what they wrote was ever read.  Maybe Emily Dickenson really didn't care if anybody ever read her poems, and that she was just glad to have the creative juices flowing on a regular basis.  On a side note, after every thought I have, I feel like I should be putting in a link to something I read that would show you why I'm having these questions.  The problem is, my brain is not yet attached to the Internet in a way that would allow you to link to it.  Unless...
Alright, here's the thing.  It's two in the morning, I have a paper to write, and it's due in the morning.  What do you do?  I'll tell you what you do: you write the thing.
And one more thing.  Sveta, if you're reading this, I'm waiting for an open moment to send you an email worth receiving!
Hello again.  There's something magical about eBay.  I had to sell something I didn't need at all, and which no one I knew wanted.  So I listed it on eBay and within 24 hours someone had bought it.  It was nice.  It's not magical when you just think about how it exists now, but it's magical when you think about how it was without it, and then somebody made it exist.  Yeah!  In the spirit of the weblog, here's the link to eBay:   urlLink eBay Is Cool
Well hello everybody!  There's always a problem posting.  Either I'm working, or going to school, or something else.  But I'm not going to go so far as to say that if I wasn't in school, I wouldn't have any problem writing every day.  I would have a problem, but it would simply come in the form of laziness and c
