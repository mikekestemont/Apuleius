Hey All!  My name is Jillian, and this is the Seaside Blog!  Members:   urlLink Jillian  Natalie  urlLink Phileda  Virginia  OK!  The Background 411:  Hi!  My name is Jillian and my family has owned a Beach house in the beautiful  urlLink Seaside, Florida  since I was four years old.  Since then, a yearly tradition has arisen when we take at least a 2-week-long vacation there in June, right after school gets out.  For a long time, it was only my family and Natalie's family, but after Nat and I went to camp and met the infamous  Phileda , we decided that she should come along as well!  And as for Virginia, she is a wonderful product of my move to Atlanta, GA, and of my Jr. High school Pace Academy.  She is my best friend from Hotlanta, and is a fantastic addition to our wonderful tradition!  All four of these fantastic girls have been granted access to this blog, and hopefully will be posting their own thoughts, ideas, and stories on this board, for all of y'all to enjoy!  That's all for now!
If someone from the Seaside managerial committee is reading this, give these boys a raise! Bradley, Zachary, Robbie, and Torrence (?). These four young men gave us excellent assistance in the Bike Rental Shoppe and the Adult Pool. When we were new to Seaside these four young men welcomed us in and showed us that not all poolside workers are 50+ recovering alcoholics. Many of them are, in fact, attractive teenagers looking for summer jobs. Now, I'm not saying they don't have their... retarded sides, but they are generally fairly normal. We would like to thank them for not kicking us out of the adult pool and for not landing on top of us in the pool- feel sure that would have resulted in a couple of broken bones. So to these hotties I say hello, Philadelphia
Well hello all,  Sadly our time at Seaside has passed, ( I was sooooooo upset when I left), but we did have a pretty awesome time. I am sure that Seside needs a rest from us after all that we did. Sadly we never did get to that documentary that we wanted to do, o well. On the other hand we did do a pretty good job conjuring up fun. My new fav place in Seaside is the adult pool(hehehehehe), though I must admit that I went to the adult pool not only to enjoy the pool, there were a few other reasons (hehehe). O well, we also did very well finding guys, though I have now officaly been branded a boy-crazy girl, even though I am not one. We had a marvelous time with all of them, except one named Joey , and his sister Rachael (whose last names will not be given away for there personal protection, trust me, if you knew what they did you would turn red). I am afraid though that I owe an apology to a certain boy named Stephen, I am so sorry, please forgive me. And also to all the people who I meant to say goodbye to but never got a chance, well a hearty GOODBYE to all. Anyway got to run, going to see a movie.                                   Ciao,                                Natalia                                 (you know you love me)
Ok, what were we talking about anyways?  Neither Philly or I remember, so we'll just recount what has happened so far.  Ok, we went the beach the first day and all four of us were horrifically sunburned... we're peeling and blisterin all over the place. So... now we are all four here now, so we're gonna say some cool stuff...   Well, It's rained for the past 2 days, and we have not started said documentary yet... we have had several encounters with boys, but none of them seem to like me.  They always fall for Natalie (most of the time) or Phileda, and I am surprised to say that Virginia hasn't really had them falling all over her... she's so pretty i would expect them to.  Anyways, I don't think it's that important anyway because I mean, boys might seem important now, but in the long run, the only thing that matters is that we have a blast!  Which at the moment, I am succeeding fabulously!  So, I guess all is good on the Tantiginous Donut.    I am very tired because we have been getting up early to either go running or meet boys at 8:30 in the morning (throw's hairbrush at Phileda).  I plan on sleeping late tomorrow morning, ahem, no matter what.  Well, I'm sure my lovely girlies can think of ways to get me out of bed, but I'm so so sure that it would be incredibly incredibly hard to do... see? I'm rambling on like a crazy woman! This is a sign of tiredness...  So the sun finally came out today!  We went the the pool and further developed our sunburns... i mean... uh... TANS... we are... TAN i promise... well, its all good.  it will turn into tan, but im just scare of becoming one of those gross 50 year old ladies with really gross leathery/cancery looking skin... so i make sure to apply SPF 30 everyday, even though it has given me sun poisoning in the past andmy dermo in atlanta told me not to do it, but i really dont wanna get too much more badly burned... and im not breaking out it itchy red bumps so i dont have sun poisoning, so ive decided that my dermo was wrong... WHOA im going way off subject...  So seaside has rocked my socks off so far, and its so exciting that its so much fun!  we actually go up to talk to boys this year instead of just watching them and giggling... oh we were so silly!  well, I'll talk to all you cool people later... i have some serious dinner to eat!    You know I'm worth it!  -Jilly
