What a day.   Apparently I'm good at helping people.   I'm a bit bored of it.  OK, not completely. But there's so much of it. People being hospitalized. People getting separated. People being afraid. Everyone needs petting. And hand holding. And some of them deserve it and need it. Most of them? Do not. Making me completely crazy.  I guess I'm very lucky. I know that if I ever needed anything like a place to stay or a ride to the hospital or a thousand dollars to keep me and my baby alive (my fictional baby) I'd have more than one place to turn. And I'd probably have more than one person who could look at this situation and figure out how to make it better, how to make the worst not necessary. It turns out that most people don't have that. How is that possible?  But anyway, I'm home now. I can do stuff for my life and I don't have a mother and toddler living with me and no one is homeless or injured or dead. And tomorrow is another day.  And I have a blog. That's pretty cool. The novelty has certainly not worn off in the last 24 hours.  Hopefully soon I'll be able to bring the funny.
Dear Big Cheese of Secretaries,  Here at Team Copoc we know that a job description is a jumping off place. The members have the opportunity to stretch their limits and use all of their skills. Sometimes ones we did not even know we had.  Given these wide parameters it is encumbent upon the members of the team both to explore our own boundaries and to know when our limits have been reached, for the good of the team.  Knowing this, it is time for me to bow out gracefully, for my own good as well as that of the team. Please let this serve as my resignation,  Perhaps in the future I can assist the team in another capacity.  Sincerely, The chick who is crying in the bathroom every day
I'm working on a lot of things. One of them is just doing stuff. Not waiting until it's perfect. Not checking out all the angles. Trusting myself enough to know that if I want to do it then it's worth trying.  I've wanted a Blog for a long time. I waffle between thinking I'd be good at it and wondering why I'm so damned interested in the lives of people I've never met.    You know what? Everyone and their dog has a blog these days. If I like this I'll have 2 pretty soon. One for here and one for events that will link to my web site (www.ElizabethHRobinson.com). And, particularly for this one, it doesn't matter if I'm good at it. And, if all they say is true, I'll get better at it the more I try.   Right now, no one knows that I have this. At least for the next few minutes no one even has a way to search for me. So I can do whatever I want.    I'll post all sorts of stuff here. Stories and ramblings and opinions without back up and erotica and who knows what else. I have no idea where to start. So this is it. A start. A way to get over the first tough step.    We shall see what tomorrow brings.
The time I sat on the steps outside 117 Hudson clutching a lamp and 2 bags and a chair, waiting for the car service with my ex-friend L. M was moving out of the NYC home of the company and everything that couldn't be moved was sitting out on the street. A pile of boxes and bags probably 12 feet long and 5 feet high at least. I don't remember what we were talking about, because what could we be talking about? Life as we knew it was moving. And this family comes along, 2 women and I think 2 kids, elementary school age. They saw the couch and the living room chair and they were considering taking them home. L and I, desperate for our surrogate home not to be thought of as useless and trashy, proceed to sell the items. Not for money, I mean, but tell that family how comfortable and how easy to carry. We go down to the enormous pile of life and find the bag with the cushions in it, help them figure out the load, offer to wait with any bits they can't carry until they can get back. And we watch as they wander away with the living room furniture.  Walking behind my married boyfriend and his wife in a crush of people walking back to Columbus Avenue from the Delacorte Theatre. Knowing that he knows that I'm there but knowing that he'll wig if I show myself and, more importantly, not knowing at all if the wife would recognize me if she saw me. At the time it was exciting and surreal. Thinking about it now, it's embarrassing and ridiculous.  The time that my grandmother died and my mom took her wedding and engagement rings and told me to put them in my pocket because she wanted me to have them but she had to take care of it with my uncle first. So later that night we're getting into the car. Uncle J driving, mom in the passenger seat and me behind her. So I'm sitting there and mom says, "J, I'd like Kizz to have mom's rings. I mean, after all, it might be the only diamond she ever gets." I'm sitting right there.  I got the rings.  I mean, who could have refused that pitch in honor of my pathetic loveless life. I didn't realize quite how pathetic and loveless until mom pointed it out. And I'll bet a dollar that if I told that story to my mom she'd tell me it never happened that way.
I am not a step parent. So take my opinion for what you will.   Step parenting is the most thankless job under the w
