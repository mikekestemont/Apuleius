Edmonton is a big city of almost one million of people in a very very large area.  It is a city spread very thin, so that it does not feel too tightly packed.  Its most famous attraction is a mall (an arcade of diverse shops) that was largest in the world, and contains thrill-enducing rides that are very fun!  One of the cousins of a friend is employed there as a dolphin, whose job is to chronicle the stories of the mall rats, who are not rats at all but are instead humans of age 11-15 who live at the mall.  Edmonton is also a centre of world culture, with many many festivals and theatres, and a brand spanking new concert hall entitled the Winspear Centre, which contains the symphony and Alice Cooper.  Edmonton is far north (but hot - not cold!) and has the northern lights in the sky, which may be projected from the mall.   Edmonton is not named after anything I recognize.  It has a large river that devides the city into northern and southern hemispheres, each with its own unique history and attractions.  According to the internet sources Edmonton is maybe Canada's most important city, containing the seat of government for the wealthiest of its provinces.  And since Canada is voted one of the most important countries in the earth, this is a big thing!  As yet, I have however not left Alex's house and back-house yard.  This means that I can tell you about his house and yard but not about Edmonton, or about what Alex does when he vacates the house in his bicycle or car.  I must soon find a way to follow him or I will lose my job.  Next time though I will tell you about this very very pleasant and spacious house.
I was alarmed this evening that has just passed by because Alex went out from the house at 5:30 of the evening on his bicycle (which I heard him say is the same one from Scotland (one year previous from now?) and her name is Kilda) and went to have a sushi with a friend from Toronto who lives here now, always.  This friend was born yesterday and this was a celebration.  I do not know what a sushi is, but it may be expensive.  This is a big celebration!  I knew Alex would then be going to the Fridge festival to see dramatic productions, as he has done every evening this far.  But he did not come home!  I waited in his room and I surfed using the internet too look up some things about Edmonton.  I will tell you these in a next entry to this blog.  Alex came home on foot at 5 of the morning, on this morning!  He was bandaged on the left knee, the right hand and right finger, and was very very tired.  Today he said to the telephone that he was in a bicycle accident when returning from Fridge productions yesterday evening at midnight, when his bicycle hit a piece of road and he fell off of one side, hitting first his left knee and wrist and then his right finger, then hand, then elbow and shoulder.  Then he hit his head, but gently and only on the side of his helmet.  Two nice young members of a couple from a small island near Vancouver Island (this is near here?) were there next to the road that Alex's bicycle hit, and brought him in a van to put his bicycle home and then took him to a hospital, where he waited for a very very very long time to be served.  It is my pleasure to report that he is not badly hurt! - merely bruised on his finger.  He had suspected breakage but no.  Do not worry for him!
I am now not going to type to you very much because I have spent so much of today lying under the sun, on the hot cement between the back of Alex's house and the garage.  This is an example of where it is good to be able to hide or, barring the door to that, become invisible, because one does not expect leopard geckos to be resting on the cement on the behind of their house in Canada.  I know that leopard geckos are not from Canada, though I do not know where they are from, perhaps though Africa where leopards are from (one of my friends from home is currently a leopard and tells me much of Africa, which I know is bigger than Edmonton).  I do not see why a leopard gecko or any lizard cannot be happy in Edmonton, because Edmonton is very very hot and has long days and much sun.  At the least this is true of Alex's backyard and environs.  I think if I were a human I would have rested on the grass of Alex's backyard, which is sizable, or if I were a large rabbit like the large rabbit that I have seen pass many times, I must say boldly for a rabbit!, though he is very very large, in the alleyway bedhind these houses, I would rest in the garden and also eat.  One of Alex's housegirls tends this garden for him, and grows many things though I do not understand what they are and so I do not know what they are like for eating.        What this means is that from resting in the sun I am tired.  Haven taken the form of a lizard has made me wish to rest in the sun, like a lizard, but I am not truly a lizard, remember.  The sun makes me truly tired.      I know that Alex spent many hours of today inside of his new house.  He must like his house!  Or perhaps he is tired from the journey, or perhaps he is scared of Edmonton and does not wish to see it.  Or so I thought, because at the evening he went on his bicycle (which always until now was on t
