It has been one eventful day, for sure. First off, Natalie gets bitchy about me not liking Mike, and a bitch fest ensues, ending up with me blocking her. We argued all over a damn thread, then I blocked and deleted her and Mike from MSN. Friendship over, it seems. Whatever. Now she can free up her time and devote even more of it to Mike. Mike isn't even all that good looking anyway. I've seen much better.  After that, Ali tells me that she loves me. This was a shock..she said she loved me for a while, but didn't say anything because I was with Nikki. Ali ends up winning me over.......
I'm so tired of misdirected feelings..I'm tired of loving "her". I can't get rid of my feelings for her, no matter how hard I try. I won't ever lose the hope that her and her lover will break up and I'll have my chance at her..I'm so stupid. Why can't I just forget...it was something never meant to be.
It's fucking hot in my room and my PS2 broke...oh, the inhumanity! Arguing with Justin about how he's changed didn't help cool me down either. He's a bit too stupid about his looks these days.  Well anyways, it's getting real late, and Mandy is my only entertainment. Sleep now, hehe
I think that I am becoming my best friend Natalie. I'm GROWING into her. XD Both my blonde moments and typos have been much more frequent than ever before, which is a sure danger sign. I believe I am developing *gasp* St.Louis Stenographic Syndrome, as Justin so eloquently put it. I fear for myself. O_________O
Below, is why I hate two of my oldest romantic interests.  Well, Sana faked being in a coma to see how much I'd care for her. Yeah...what a great friend. Not only that, she became a bitch about how DPKT is run, and suggested that she'd tell Invision about this board so it would be deleted. Yeah...and she became a bitch about the forums AFTER she cheated on her boyfriend with me. And on top of that...she's an immature, incompetent dumbass.  As for Hikari...gee, where to start? She got into a lustful relationship with me by telling me that she loved me when she really didn't, and kept begging me to screw her everytime she posted. When she got mad at me about anything, she pretended to be her friend Caitlin so she could cuss me out. When I figured out it was Hikki (which was easy, since the real Caitlin told me it was Hikki all along), both Hikki and Caitlin denied that anything had ever happened. I KNOW THAT I WAS GETTING BITCHED AT, KTHX. I'M NOT THAT STUPID. I really don't care if she ever talks to me, since she's on her, what, second boyfriend since I broke up with her. Yeah...love forever my ass.
My first post in my new blog...now onto my incoherent ramblings, yes? ^_^  School's kinda getting me depressed. In order to pass my Finals, I have to get good grades on everything (including Algebra...ewww), and they're forcing me to type up some long report AND 24 creative writing assignments! Jebus, why can't it be easier to pass? ;_;  I started feeling better when I got home though. Today was my girlfriend Nicolai's birthday, but unfortunately I did not have the time or money to send her something. However, proclamations of love and romance, and a beautiful poem was able to suffice. ^_^
I'm officially single ladies...and now you'll keep your legs closed from now on, then. >_>  Yup...Colleen broke up with me...seems like she only liked me as a friend..which was weird, because the day before she told me she was in love with me. I wish she had her feelings sorted out before telling  me she liked me. Oh well...another failed "relationship." I run through girls toooooo quickly. It's really sad. >_>  There's been some romance sparking between Stephanie and I. :O I really don't want to date anyone though...I'd rather just stay single and flirt with her. That would be better in the long run, and would prevent needless heartbreak.   And I've started liking Sana again for the last month or so...yea............................................................................ god help me. -_-
"If you cyber with a girl while you're in an online relationship, then you're cheating."  Is that right? >_>  Well, I suppose I cheated on Colleen if you ant to look at it that way. I was really horny, and Steph, who I used to have the hugest crush on, told me she wanted me. @_@  So yeah...I took the opportunity without thinking of the consequences (as usual) and did it...SOMEHOW Justin knew I had done it and he and Nat started arguing with me over whether it was cheating or not..and at one point Nat said that I was classless and was no good to women. And of course Mike had to say it again. Newsflash: HAVING MIKE SAY ANYTHING TO ME DOES NOT HELP AT ALL. >_>  So I'm just going to have to talk to Colleen and hope she doesn't hate my guts afterwards. >>  Also, I got to see a new picture of Sana. Oh my lord is that girl hot. Just....wow.   Anyways, yea. Summer school starts on Monday, as well. Reallllllly not a good weekend. -_-
Seems like things turned out all right after all. Colleen and I stayed up until about four in the morning talking (XD), and there was actually some serious talking going on. :O  Even though Sensui/Sesshomaru kept trying to persuade Colleen into thinking I'm a bad boyfriend by saying I abused Hikki, Nat, blah, blah, Colleen thankfully didn't listen to that jealous bastard. ^_^  It was kinda romantic, hehe. I made a topic in the Love House forum at ADG about how much I care for her..then she told me she loved me and wanted to be my girlfriend. I'm finally happy, hehe.
I've got such an empty feeling in my stomach. Yesterday Colleen told me that she thought me and her were closer when we w
