Last night after I posted my blog my sweet mate Salia and her brother Justo came and kidnapped us to go to dinner and the mall.  We went to one of the most amazing italian restaurants I have ever been to.  It was called Italliani's and it was muy bueno!  Justo and I spent the evening talking about theatre.  He is a communications major because his dad wouldn't let him major in theate.  I think I learned more spanish last night than in all of my classes so far.... They are such great people! and they have a car which is good because the public transportation scares me!  Salia is a handful!! she is 18 and has just finished her first year at UDLA... She is so great!  she got so upset when she found out how old I was because I look younger than all of them.  I probably look the youngest in our entire group and yet with the exception of the 2 in their late 40s I am the oldest.  And so far I feel it.  I have a hard time keeping up with these kids!!    We had our second cooking class today.  It was alot of fun.  We learned to make frijoles charro and chilaquiles verdes... es sooooo yummy!! I like chilaquiles!! and it is so much fun to say!!  When I get back we are definately having a dinner party.  Tonight Salia is taking us to the supermercado so we can do our grocery shopping.  It is very exciting! that way we don't have to eat out all the time.  I leave for Oaxaca at 6 in la manaña.  Everyone else is going clubbing tonight.... I am going to bed.  Maybe the dorms will be quiet for once....
Today was nice and relaxed.... After class and lunch I came back to my dorm put on some laundy and took a siesta! After my nap Alysa and I went to Salia´s room and watched some TV.  American TV is so bland in comparison!!  Salia is helping us with our pronunciations and Mexican slang! She is fabulous!! Tonight I have alot of homework so that is probably how I will spend my evening.  I have two papers to write and some stories to read.  I am really looking forward to this weekend and the trip.  I also found out today where to get the settings for my wireless card.  So now hopefully I will be able to use my laptop to access the internet.  I also added new pictures so be sure to check them out!!
Today was a much better day! Classes went well. I really like my teachers.  They are very patient and understanding.  The group is starting to try to talk in spanish amongst ourselves which has lead to some very amusing spanglesh episodes... today at lunch we had little white potatoes as a side dish.  One of the girls tripped and they fell off her plate and went everywhere.  She yelled out... -Oh no! I have spilt mi papas all over me!!- I probably shouldn't have laughed at that but I did.     I had my first cooking class as well today! ... I am going to love that class.  We get to eat what we make at the end of class.  It was sooo yummy!! Today we made chalupas and rice pudding from scratch... I don't like rice pudding so much but the chalupas were amazing.  After class we headed back to the dorms.  I got a shower and took a nap... I know it was very exciting... and now I am starting on the mounds of homework I have.  This weekend I am going to Oaxaca!! I am very excited!!
FIrst day of classes.... Not too bad.  The teachers are very patient and I wasn't the worst person in the class so that is good I think.  I haven't felt very well today... mostly lack of sleep and dehydration.  I hope. The native students moved in for summer classes yesterday and our dorm is no longer quiet.  If I thought the noise was bad in the dorms at UH... at least there was carpet there to absorb some of it.  I don't think I have ever seen so many people who talk so much.  They make my girls look like quiet subdued little people.  I am going to have to find time to go into Puebla and find somewhere with earpulgs.  They also all smoke and there are no rules about not smoking in the dorms.  Not real fond of cigarette smoke but I suppose I will get used to it.  Ok enough complaining.  You guys might get the impression I am not having a good time.  At lunch they served a soup that was amazing.  One of the best things I have ever tasted!!  I signed up for my extra cultural classes as well today.  I am taking cooking and ballroom dancing.  I am very excited about it.  Now I have to walk to the store for dinner before it gets dark.
We went to explore Puebla today. The three of us chicas from houston hooked up with a group from New Hampshire for dinner last night and again today for the tour.  They are so much fun!!  Our Animadore (Host student),Geraldo, showed us how to use the public bus into puebla... if I thought the plane ride was scary the bus.... a million times worse... fun but scary.... It goes like 60 70 miles an hour on these tiny winding cobblestone streets paying little to no attention to the enormous speed bumps they have all over Chaloula.  Better than that, the seat that I choose to sit in happened to not be bolted the rest of the bus.  It was exciting...   We got to Puebla and walked to the main square.  It was only 9:15 on Sunday morning so everything was still closed so we wondered around til 10 looking at chuches... so many churches...more and more churches... Then we found a bookstore and I picked up some books in spanish.  It was starting t
