Jeezus god. Thursday and Friday were some of the worst days at work I have EVER had. Thursday was SOOOO busy! We saw about a bazillion cases, and the neuro techs were there until 11 pm or so. The sad thing was that the last case that kept them there so late could have been taken by the surgery department. They offered, they begged, neuro declined. So they were there uber late. Then Friday I had forgotten that I had volunteered to be a neuro bitch, since two of them needed the day off. No biggie, right? Hah! We had to deal with everything left from the day before, PLUS a bunch of transfers, a CT, and having to deal with all the weekend shit (new hospitalization sheets and all). I got out of there at about 8 pm, which made it a 13 hour day for me. Sadly, it was more interesting than my ususal job, sitting in the MRI trailer running scans.    I think I'm going to go back to school. I actually think I'm going to get my engineering degree after all. Kinda dumb, I know, but it still appeals to me on a basic, intellectual snob level.   So, I can get my associates at a local community college, and then finish at the school in the city. I'm guessing, with me working, it will take about 7 years. At least. BUT, if I can manage to work part time, I should be able to finish a lot sooner. We'll see.  Saw Texas Chainsaw Massacre today. Not that great, but not as bad as some of the critics seemed to think. I am partial to Jessica Biehl. If I could look like her, I would. In a heartbeat. I'm also partial to bad movies anyway. The weird thing was that the theater was SOOOOO cold! I kept expecting to see my breath. The boyfriend kept snuggling me, but I was still ridiculously cold. I've used scary movies as an excuse to snuggle with a guy, but this was absurd!
I have graduated to running anesthesia on neurology cases. This dubious honor is due to one of the neuro techs quitting recently. I can't say that I blame her, haven't I been thinking about doing the same myself? The upshot of this is that now my mornings are spent anesthetizing dogs who have all sorts of issues, and then keeping them alive while we inject potentially reaction-inducing dye into their cerebrospinal fluid. Imagine my joy. On the bright side, if we do the myelograms in the morning, it means I will generally get out on time in the evening. Generally.  I saw a story about some Christmas thing today on the (obscenely early) morning news. It nearly made me ill. Then I realized, "Hey, at least they waited until after Halloween!" That's really sad. At least I don't work retail anymore. Black Friday will live in my memory forever. I'm pretty sure that's where child molesters go when they die, only the customers get to sodomize them, too.  In talking with one of my coworkers, we discussed the allure of a guy who undresses you (to any extent) with his teeth. Men, take note. All it takes is nudging up the shirt, or slipping a bra strap off the shoulder, to make us shiver. I could really use more of that in my life, but then who couldn't?  Today's insult of the day: Flanksucker. Long story.
God I hate mornings. Well, that's not totally true. I hate early mornings, which is pretty much all the weekday mornings. I don't mind mornings when I get to sleep as late as I want. And I am coming to hate the local morning newscasters; no human being should be that chipper at 5 am.   I wonder if I'll have to work late today. I never really know; it all depends on what comes through the door. Needless to say, this really screws up whatever facsimile of a social life I've had. My cries for scheduling have gone unheeded, so some days I wait 5 or 6 hours, and end up getting overtime to do one scan. It's stupid.   So, is it normal for someone in a long term, comitted relationship to find themselves ogling every good looking man that walks by? I can't decide. I just really like men! But I find that I am VERY tempted, more than I should be. I can't decide if that means that our relationship has issues, or just that I do. Hm.
Well, here we go. I think maybe I'm just an exhibitionist at heart, hence this cyberspace soul-searching. Or maybe I'm just inherently narcissistic. I dunno.   For those of you who are wondering, Cleo is one of my two cats. She's insane. No, really insane. And she has this weird, spaced out look we like to call the "I like cheese" look. Hence the title.  We is me and my (sometimes) fiance. We've been together for five years now, and engaged for four. Until I realized I was miserable and broke it off. And then he groveled, and I reconsidered, and here I am, still living here. But I'm not wearing the ring, as if that matters.  I work in an emergency/critical care veterinary hospital, which means its a lot like ER, except with more bodily fluids, and the patients are way more pissed off. Some days are better than others, but for the most part I'm looking to do something else. After coming down with both an ulcer and gray hairs at 25 years old, I think it's time for a career change!  Mostly, I'm trying to figure out why I'm unhappy in my life. I think I'm coming up with some answers, but not many solutions. Yet. I'm also trying to decide if I'm expecting too much from myself and those around me, and life in general. Who the hell knows. So. More introspection later, the boyfriend is agitating for the computer. He wants to check his fantasy football scores.   Men.
Um, yeah. So not d
