Why does the color blue mean raspberry-flavored?    what about blueberry? Blueberries aren't blue, they're more like purple. So, they should be called, purpleberries.
Ok, my husband and I went last night to see Troy.  And after doing some research  a few days before, I noticed a few things from the legend and Hollywood.  For one, Helen's husband, Menelaus, was to live according to legend but in the movie, he dies.  In legend, Paris dies but not in the movie.  Apparently the writer's wanted to keep the "couple" together and not say with legend.  But come on, why should I be surprised?  It's not like this is the first time that Hollywood has changed events to fit what they want.  Look at Pocahontas.  The Disney movie portrayed her as a young beautiful woman, where as in truth, she was fat ugly and REALLY young...like 10.  Capt. John Smith, in the movie, young hansom...in truth, 40-ish, bald, short and so on.    But back to the movie of Troy, other than the little who dies and who doesn't I was just waiting for Hector played by Eric Bana(aka Bruce Banner..Hulk) to start turning green when he got angry.  And Odysseus played by Sean Bean (aka Boromir...Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring)well, with him, it seems like all movies I've seen him in, he dies.  But not this one, first movie where he lives.  And let's not forget Paris played by Orlando Bloom  (Legolas...LOTR trilogy) can't seem to stay away from a bow.  In his first fight scene, can we say wuss.  But it was all good.  How about a half god, Achilles played by Brad Pitt.  Too bad we couldn't see more of his fine butt.  But Brad did spin the whole half god thing a new way.  He made Achilles more human, a little sensitive.  Yeah, he was all for glory, but he also loved his women just as much.  LOL   Now off subject...for the past two days, I've been working alot.  One of the employees I work with has only been working there for 3 weeks but acts like she manages the place.  For instance, it's nonsmoking.  She thinks, hey I work alone mostly, all I have to do is use air freshener.  Which is wrong... smoking inside is prohibited no matter what.  Apparently, she wants to get me fired or something.  But I'm hip to her game.  But that's not all of it.  She gives away merchandise and takes what she wants without paying.  Can we say thief?  I've already told Kevin, the manager, that she gives away stuff.  But from what I saw yesterday, she paid for it...who's to say that she won't the next time.  She says that she pays for the stuff that she takes when she takes it, that I just don't see it...that I'm busy doing other things.  So, knowing what I know,  the first thing that I would do if I become manager is fire her for theft.  fflkda;lkdjf;alkdjf;alskdjf;alskdfja;slkdfjasl;kdfj;alskdfja;sldkfj;alkdfj;aldkfja;slkdfjasl;kdf....that's my mind thinking..LOL    Here's something else...the stores air conditioning doesn't work.  So yesterday and today, I've had to work in heat.  Let's just say, fresh air was cool and naturally felt good.  But that's beside the point.  The point, the AC needs to be fixed   soon .  That's all folks...Please walk calmly single file to the nearest exit.
You've been invited to a fancy ball but the only thing you have to wear is an orange wooly jumper. What shoes do you wear?     Gee, that's a toughy. Shoes... If I were to wear anything orange, which by the way is NOT my color, I would finish the outfit to really stand out. Fluffy Pink slippers. Who cares that it's a fancy ball, wear what's comfortable...if you call an orange wooly jumper comfortable, more power to ya.
Ok, just finished my first day at this new job.  Bare in mind, I haven't worked in a year, due to the fact that my husband, Chris wanted me to stay home and be a housewife.  So, after a year and his own job in danger of being nonexistent, I started applying for a job.  Now I'm one of the hundreds of people who work in convience stores.  My day:  spent the entire 8 hours cramming tons of knowledge like, Tic Tacs are 79 cents plus whatever tax....8.25%.  In the middle of the shift, my manager, Kevin tells me that in a few months he'll be leaving and that I'm the first to know... so keep on the downlow.  Then he proceeds to tell me that when he leaves that I'M going to take his place.  Gee, I work for one of their rivals for a few months last year, and now "I'm a veteran of the convience store working class".  So, imagine my shock to hear that on my first day.  Here's something else to rant about...PineSol.  The stuff that was used tonight was so strong that I came home smelling of it.  And I didn't even use it.  Imagine how much stronger it would be when I start using it, or is there a why to dilute it some.     Now the dilemma:  stay with this company full time knowing that I will advance in a few short months or go to school in a few short weeks...if I finish everything in time.  I still need to take my TASP and sign up for classes.  The only thing is, school starts on June 2.  Will I have enough time to work and go to school full time?  I really want to get a degree in English.  But I'm torn, really.  If I don't go to school this summer, the question is:  will I ever?  Will I continue coming up with excuses on not going or take the plunge and actually get my butt in gear and take classes?  The way Kevin was talking, I'll be the new manager by the end of the summer.  And if I decide to become the manager, there will be no time for school.  So, I could wait til the end of the summer f
