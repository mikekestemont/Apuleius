Woohooo! After lots of annoying and endless work, I've finally managed to get it all up to date. Citizenship coursework...IT coursework...ahhhh. All done. What a loverly feeling.  TUESDAY: So easy...did nothing but discuss ebay, blackadder and cliff jumping all morning. Then double PE...always fun. Suprisingly, Holly  didn't  mention asking Nat out once on the way home. Not once! Though she did tell me REPEATED TIMES exactly where she and Nat would be on Friday, and how I should join them. Pffffft. Stayed up past midnight doing cwk *shudder* kinda fell asleep working, so half my citizenship will probably be stuff like "76yhbygh vtxfcred4f" - Yes, that was the result of hitting my head against the keyboard. Seriously! And oh well.  WEDNESDAY: Wooo, field re-opened. Whoopee-yayness. Handed in IT and citizenship cwk, as well as the french convo book which was due in....about a month ago? So me sorta happy 'cos thats 95ish% of all my work done. And the rest is so easy I could do it in my schleeeeeep. Walking to IT was....interesting. Several plots involving setting hundreds of water snakes into the sewage system were revealed, ending in a great mental image of someone running into a hospital: *Nurse* "How may I help you sir?" *Random person, butting in* "FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, A SNAKE BIT MY ASS!!!"  IT itself was fun, as usual. Those random conversations with Nat get kah-ray-zee-er every time. And pretty much everyone said how we're exactly like each other. Hmmm. Bah. Then Katie did her subtle thingo...lol. *Row in IT goes Katie - Me - Nat* *Katie* "Pssst...hey Nat...you going to the prom with Ben?" *Nat* "Yeah" *Katie* "Really? Do you think he can hear us?"  Katie really needs her head examined. She also told us that she'd had to block ebay from her home comp so she didn't get tempted to buy more Busted concert tickets. THEY SUCK DAMNIT!  Heh. Tomorrow is the last day of term...and I won't be there for half of it. Yayness. Then on Saturday...the Bristol City VS QPR match. Another golden oppertunity for my dad to make himself look like a complete idiot. Oh well. Should be fun.  In the words of collective soul: "oooooooo-oooooooooohhhhhhh...I'm not the one.....oooooooo-oooooooooohhhhhhh...I'm not the one....."
Bah. Too much work, not enough incentive.  Good stuff: Bishop got kept behind picking up paper he'd flicked in science. (ha-ha) Blackadder came 2nd in the top British sitcoms thingo, Vicar of Dibley came 3rd. (woooo!) Double PE tomorrow, always fun. (yaaaay) I have tickets to go see Bristol City play on Saturday (woo and yay)  Bad stuff: Citizenship cwk is in tomorrow. And I haven't even started it yet. (SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT) We have yet more bloody exam papers in maffs. (booooooo) I ate too much food inbetween games at badminton. (bleugh)   Holly seems to still be insane. But good at badminton. So she better be doing badminton tomorrow in PE. Or I'll have to beat the holy crap out of Olly and Phil again. (No offense guys) Either way, double PE and the walk home will be kinda crazy and fun, probably with lots of "Hey, thats not fair!"s, "stop smashing it!"s and "pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaassssssssseeeeeeeeee"s. Eehee.  And one great quote from Blackadder 4: Blackadder - "The only attractive woman around here is carved out of stone, called Venus, and is standing in a fountain in the middle of the town square with water coming out of her armpits." George - "So, we're a bit stuck, eh." Blackadder - "You can say that again George. We're in the stickiest situation since Sticky the stick insect got stuck on a sticky bun."
Coursework, coursework and...what? More coursework? Bleugh. Coursework is due in on Thurs...so I spent pretty much the whole weekend doing it. No foolin'. And somehow, I managed to only get Tasks A, C and F done. Some is done already...but argh. Very tiring, boring and generally crap. Though I have got double PE to look forward to (Tuesday). That should be fun. Apart from that the extra half hour I gain from it will be spent listening to Holly go completely crazy, then spend ages doing...*gasp* more coursework. Whoopee doo. What incredible fun.   Oh, one good thing from todays coursework blast: I had to make a flyer/poster of some kind, and what I made I'm kinda proud of...and might have to sell it or something. Eehee. http://botprojectx.topcities.com/taskc4.gif
Lots of pain today *Yaaaaay*. Jack was (for no apparent reason) doing TKD moves in Science, and managed to knife hand strike me in the neck *geughk*. At lunch, Tim punched me in the nose trying to get that damned balloon *arrrgh*. And asshole of the century Bishop not only stabbed me repeatedly with a compass in History, but elbowed me in the face in hockey.  But somehow...it was a good day! I got loads of chocolate off some person who I don't really know, had lots of supply teachers, and managed to recruit a grand total of 0 people for badminton. Lazy old... *grumble grumble*  More when I can be bothered to type it.
Hm. Probably another short post...today was boring apart from History (lots of cake) and IT (lots of funny conversations). Science...Bishop needs to learn something: there is no way I'm asking in a lesson. Not even if he set himself on fire and jumped out the window as part of a deal. And Jack should shut up 'cos he really isn't helping.   Oh, another good thing was that I managed to find Andy Craig at lunch. That kid rules. He plays badminton at a county level in an under-17 (ish) team (despite only being in yr 7). And his form tutor is cool.  Woot.
Dont really know what to say about today...it was ok in parts, crap in others. Jack really needs to listen to what Nat is saying. Before he can persuade me to make a complete idiot of myself.   "Up yours Springfield!"
Today didn't go so bad. PSE, Geog and Sci, didn't really do any work. As expected. Hadn't laughed that much in ages. Heehee. But then double IT w
