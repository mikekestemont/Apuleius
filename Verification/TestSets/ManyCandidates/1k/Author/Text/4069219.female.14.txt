Today, in math class, i had daydreams again...., normally, i wont do any work in math except copying some notes from the board...well., the teacher only use like 20 mins to teach us and the other 30 mins, we do our hw silently, its so freaken boring lors, we are nt allowed to talk  much, sigh, always fell asleep in math class .. i reflected the past today, from the first day of high school life until dat minute..nt much things are positive,, wen high school started, lotz of things changed,, being stupid and those stuff, sigh, i ht8 my school larx..... CHRISTINE's last day in carlingford high school,,sighx,,, i gave her a cutie wallet as a pressie, wish her luck , oh yea, CONGRATULATIONS julie gt recruited by Singapore International school by passed her english examination . she was planning to go bak to her previous school-shanghai american school but sadly she couldnt go in cuz she skipped almost half of grade 8... Ill miss u guys(julie and christine )a lotz, take care .. My brain just wont listen to me today, everytime i  try to concentrate and i just cant.. shit.. i am so guity, im in school to learn , nt to be slack, sighx,,,gt to change my attitude cuz that's gonna be a problem for me if i keep on being so dumb.. somehow, today i just felt truly miserable ,, im waiting for a brand new start..
Christine is goning to pennent hills high next week.....well, wish her luck .... julie now is going to attend Singapore International School in Shanghai.. nt fair,,, i hate my school, dat place really gives me a SHIT However, here im trying to talk about how slack my class is. you know how every grade there's always one class that seems to have heaps of bad kids and datz our class-8R, R for RUDE.my class is seriously sux,30 students totally and 20 of them are GUYS.(lumped with korean gangs, australian childish little dudes and some annoying asians.)Everyone is out of control They r so selfish,swearing to the teacher behind their bak( well, some teachers deserve to be swore.), throwing stuff ,mucking around and disturb every single one of us.Some teachers are very kind, they neva give us any detention and sort of things , although we sometimes feel sorry for them but we know that we'll never get into trouble,as long as the parents don't know, who cares?Even we've gt some demanding teacher,the noise degree are still high but at least everyone will pick up their study lar. Sighx, from conception to grave, my class is getting from bad to worse....... but the good thing is , our school have more than 55% non english background students (exchange students, international students and some ppl who just came here nt long ago like mi) so,, discrimination and racism is gradually dissappearing , duhx, who dares to offend those asian gangs... but still. discrimination sometimes exist.. but nt as obvious as other school lorx. Overall, my conclusion is :Carlingford high-really gives me a shit
