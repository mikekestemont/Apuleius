Yesterday's episode of The O.C. was probably the best one yet, cuz Hailey was introduced. Damn, the show just keeps getting better and better. Marrisa's damn hot, Anna's damn fricking hot, and Hailey's fricking-flames-of-hell hot. Now, if only I could remember her real name...don't ask me why, but I think Marissa's mother is kinda hot too. Speaking of hot, Maria from year 2 of MCM is pretty darn hot as well. Nice tattoo you got there, heh heh. Now, what the hell is the purpose of this post? I really have no idea. I really should be doing the damn Graph comm thing due today. But man, Hailey's so damn hot...
Today Slut did something which shocked the hell outta me: It tried to catch a lizard. The lizard was on the ceiling,&nbsp;I was&nbsp;feeding Slut, when suddenly the damned cat did a Jackie Chan and ran up my neighbor's door, jumped off it and went after the lizard. Luckily for the reptile, Slut missed. A little surprising how such a cute and affectionate animal can be such a cool and calculating hunter. A good example of how you can never judge a book by it's cover, eh. So those of you who have cats, remember; there's a little tiger in every one of them.
Women I like always seem to walk out of my life. This girl I like when I was in Sec 2 graduated. My favorite teacher suddenly quit and went back to journalism. The very first woman I think I loved left and went back to her home country. Coincidence? Tough luck? Screw relationships. Why do some people continuously seek to be in relationships? For companionship? For popularity? For sex? For the sake of getting into one?     When we like someone, how many times out of ten does it start with physical attraction? I'd say about 9. Which is why you should never trust yourself. You think you like the person, but it's just your primal instincts telling you to get into their pants and procreate to keep the human race from going extinct. The next time you think you like someone, stay back and observe. You'd be surprised how many times you feel disgusted by that person's actions. A good example of looking before you leap. You'd be hurt a lot less, you'd waste a lot less time, you'd save a lotta effort trying to attract the person's attention. And you wouldn't make yourself look like a fool.     So the next time you find yourself looking at a guy/gal and you think, "Man, s/he's hot!", you'd know it's the primape in you talking.
Open Up Your Mind is a half jap/english song by Mirai. It's a damn nice song...even a metal lover like me likes it, so it'll probably appeal to a lotta others as well. It relates to me and my situation some time back so much, it was a bit freaky. Ah well, for those of you who know what I'm talking about, good for you. Those who don't, well, I'll say when I feel like it.   In this world when life can be so tough You must be strong Just believe in yourself and don't you fear So open up your mind And close your eyes Take another look From the other side  Just remember you are not alone So don't you fear  Even though you're miles away I'm by your side So open up your mind And close your eyes I'll be there for you No matter where you are   For the full lyrics, go to http://www.animelyrics.com/anime/gsaiyuki/openupyourmind.htm.
I have no idea how some people can tell a blatant lie through their teeth just to make themselves look good. It's so pathetic. If you're gay, admit it. If you smoke, admit it. If you like to engage in certain activities with different species of rodents, admit it. No need to deny just so it will make you look cooler or better. It's becoming pretty clear to me what certain people are like. Well, if my observations are correct, time wil show everyone the truth, about what kinda persons people are. No need for me to mention names, like I always say...time will show. Oh, and just a thought, don't accept and believe things as they come. Always question and doubt. You'd be surprised how much more you'll find out if you do.
Just some stuff about what I've observed throughout the years, and what I'm still observing.  Some girls act cute around guys they like(which is disgusting and degrading in my opinion), while they can be total bitches around others. Some guys try to act cool by going out of their way to to things out of the norm, saying things which no one needs to know about, and frankly, no one wants to hear about, while at the same time, the very same guy can be a real asshole, disrespectful his parents, having ulterior motives for trying to get close a girl, etc.   To the women reading this, don't go acting cute/slutty/innocent around guys. We WILL know when you're not acting normal around us, and I think any decent guy will find it highly insulting that you think you can attract us using such degrading methods. If you do manage to get a guy this way, you'll know that his brain is in his dick.   For the guys, don't try to get a girl by trying to impress her. Don't reveal things that only you should know about just so that it'll make you look good compared to the rest. Doing so will make you look desperate, insecure and pathetic. If any girl falls for you because of what I've mentioned above, then she's probably shallow and just as desperate as you are.  Just my 2 cents' worth.
It's boring to be home alone. There's nothing much to do, nothing nice on TV(unless you consider old folks singing nice), not a lot of people online to chat with. With nothing better to do, I set Sophia's mud caked shoes(which she requested I took home, since she was going o
