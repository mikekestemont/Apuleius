ha! my brother started a blog
YAAA!! today the weather is sofa king nice, and here i am, i've sacrificed myself to the god/goddess of laundry, cleaning, and packing...  in related news, i've lost a whole bra to the process of laundering things. how the hell does that happen? and i only have, like, two bras to begin with. man i hope i didn't throw it in the dryer, cuz we all know what that means, i'm talkin' to the ladies here, and it means preparing for the stealth removal of the intrusive boob-poking underwire sometime in the near future, in the most inconvenient of places and times. like, in the middle of class, or work, or somewhere on public transportation...maybe you think you are being sneaky, maybe you think no one will see...but as the deed is over, you look around and find that there is one innocent bystander who has seen you remove the underwire. everytime i throw a bra in the dryer, i guess the thing that keeps the underwires from attacking my funbags melts off and floats away. and then, as stated above, the underwire will cause a little distress during the day, which can be handled, but soon launches a full-on attack when you least expect it. usually, right before it's time for you to go home, but still unbearable enough so that it must STOP. NOW.  oy. my dear bra:  urlLink    click to enlarge&nbsp; urlLink     hey everybody, i got bit on the armpit by a mosquito.  yeah and i talked to my mom today. i broke down and told her i was riding a bike to NY. i'm such a sucker. i wasn't gonna tell her because i didn't want her to worry, but i'm horrible at being sneaky and lying, even though i live 2,000 miles away from her. she had two things to say: 1) you better have your cell phone so you can call 2) you better NOT do it alone (she said this one several times)  i love my mom.  in a previous post, i talked about how much i disliked my previous job, but i forgot to mention, minus the few dope mofos that i met. amy is one of em. if you can think of someone who is 100% different than me, it's amy. i hadn't seen her since i quit. we hung out last night and when i got into her car, she started laughing at me and said, "we are so totally different." (this is the first time she saw me with a mohawk.) it's crazy, we are different in every single way, and every time we hang out we discover some new and exciting way that we are totally and completely different from each other, and then we laugh for about 10 minutes about it. just EVERYTHING is the opposite. and neither one of us, at any point, has made any effort to be like the other one. we don't eat each other's food, or wear clothes like the other one, or any of that other nonsense. and we never try to get the other one to change (one time i let her dress me up like a hussy though and we went "clubbin"-i think that's what the kids are callin' it these days).   i love it, and you should too.  AND...yesterday i went to the taste of chicago (huge street food fair) with danielle. listen to these little clips of conversation:  (on the way there)-----------  me: "i'm so F*ING hungry, i haven't eaten in a day-anna-half, if i don't eat soon i'm gonna kill you." d: "we could've gotten something at one of the food places in my building."  me: "i thought we were walking to the taste right now? wait, are we?" d: "oh yeah"  (insert a local band playing beatles' music)--------  d: "whoa, i really love reggae, we should go to a reggae bar soon" me: "hey, this is a beatles' song...is that what made you think of the reggae bar?" d: "yeah...this is the beatles?"  if that isn't funny, you had to be there. it was funny. it still is, YA!
EVERYBODY! f*ing put down that crack pipe and listen to this. i would like to dedicate this next post to my friend melina. she has somehow gotten the impression that i'm a f*ing dating service, and her slave. and i am both of those things, mind you. melina is pretty close to being the funniest mutherhumper that i know on the planet, and she doesn't even have to hump muthers to do it. HOLY SHIT SHE IS FUNNY. really. one time her mom found her vibrator, she told her mom it was a foot massager, and her mom BELIEVED IT. melina is mexican. she is also really girlie, and uses really good lip stuff/balm/shiny stuff/grease. she doesn't have herpes (i ask her every time i need to use her lipstuff). she will send you really dirty, nasty text messages and sexually explicit voicemails in the middle of the night. i can only aspire to make out with the melina. but she doesn't generally love the ladies (however, i have seen her have "eye sex" with a number of her female friends). i think she likes men who are well-hung, and have muscles. speaking spanish would be a plus for you, so you know what the hell she is yelling at you. we had a chat this evening, and here is some of how it all went down:  BLoOKunGFOo (12:47:46 AM): HEY!
