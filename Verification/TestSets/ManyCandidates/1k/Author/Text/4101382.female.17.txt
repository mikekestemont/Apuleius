Well, I am not good at writing my thoughts out so here goes...  I was on my way home from my Dad's after dropping him off, after a long day of movies, and I couldn't help but watch the lightening streak across the sky.  I kept thinking of all that has happened in my life:  apendectamy, 2 knee surgeries, wisdom teeth removed, death of my grandpa when I was too little to remember, all the friends I have gone through, the new ones I have met along the way including my twin... Lacey!!..., it really made me realize that everything I have gone through doesn't really matter anymore.  The thing that really matters is what is happening right now as we speak.  The lightening to me kind've symbolize me putting all my memories away so I can live in the present and not in the past.  I need to grab life by the horns.  Live life to the fullest.  Do what I need to do. Although I am not sure what that is right now, but I am sure that when I get older that I will come to realize what that is.  However this post is getting quite long so I am going to end it.  I am also getting tired.  I am going to try to sleep tonight.. I watched Dreamcatcher tonight and I have a feeling that I won't sleep very well.  So until next time.  Ta Ta
Well today was fun.  After not being able to sleep because I kept thinking about the good times Kari and I have had, I had to go to work, two hours early I might add.  I got to go to JCPenny's before to pick up an outfit, which didn't fit when I tried it on when I got home... GRRRR!  And I also got to get two new pairs of shoes.  Then I headed to work just to find out I had to work with MIKE SKINNER!!!!!!!!!!!!!  AWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I came so close to walking out today.  After not having had a good night or day I was put on express ignored by Mike and called Audrey about 20 times by Mike.  I was so mad, but to lighten the mood, Mitch and Ryan Phillips decided that they would drop about 30 bottles of apple juice from the display.  It was an accident that broke 14 bottles, soaked the floor, fill Ryan's shoes and make him smell like apple juice.  Then I had one of the creepy nightstockers hitting on me (that was scary but I laugh at his attempt, it was very good).  I ended up walking out on Mike with 10 mins left.  He wasn't happy when he saw me getting groceries at like 9:55, oh well.  If he pulls his normal shit tomorrow, I will leave at 9:00 and not stay to help.  He is such a jerk, he needs to be fired.  I actually think Jordan was a better manager then he is.  Oh well, enough of me venting, I am going to go to dream land now.  Until Next Time... Ta Ta
Thanks to those who pulled me out of the house to do stuff to have somewhat of a good summer. Good bye to the friends I have lost, whether it be to college, fights, moves, or whatever the reason. Hello to the new friends I have made.  Tonight I had the privilege of saying goodbye to a life long friend, one that I later found out lied to me. Makes you feel great doesn't it. Then I also got to say good bye in a nother way, a fight perhaps, to a nother life long friend whom I hope to not see again for a while. I just hope they had a great summer. I just had a peachy one, besides the few times I was with Lacey, Jeffery, Geoff, Jacob, and friends from work, my summer sucked. I hope they are happy with themselves for what they did, I just want to know one thing, am I important enough for anyone's friendship? No one besides the few I listed above seems to be proving that. Hope this year goes fast, I can't wait to leave. I dont' even want to walk into the school on tuesday where I spent 3 years with those people. I don't want to remember. Well enough. I am done. Until Next Time... Ta Ta
I was thinking the other day, hard to believe I know, but I was thinking about all the good times I have had in life.  Sneaking Kari out of her house when she was grounded, going to the concert with Kari and Lyndsey, all the wonderful football games in the cold, the football championship where we crushed Gregory 34-6 (or was it 34-7, I can't remember), mine and Kari's notes in math and study hall.  Everything that I will miss greatly.  I am going to miss Kari and Paul and Lyndsey so much.  I will miss the First Priority Group from last year (Andrew and Josh and Ben).  I will miss everything.  But I was also thinking of everything that will happen.  All the great times that are next to come.  One of them is going to happen at 8:00 Wednesday night -->Beach Boys concert.  I am greatly awaiting the football games to come, homecoming, prom, graduation, everything.  So I am goign to charge full speed into my senior year hoping to have more wonderful memories for the future to look back on.    Until next time... Ta Ta
I haven't posted in a couple days.  Not much has happened.  Went to work on Tuesday.  Nothing big happened there.  Except, Emily almost tripped over the flat bed trying to get away from the falling water.  Other then that nothing big.  I went shopping with my dad on Wednesday.  He bought me some jeans, cookies, and lunch.  He was feeling really generous.  He was going to get me a couple outfits for pictures but we didn't find anything.    Well right now, I am watching Blue Collar Comedy Tour (I g
