*************************************** ***************************************   May 21, 2004 (Uncherished Former Friend's Name Here)  Dear Former Uncherished Friend, (Insert His/Her Real Name)  As per customary terms of long-standing relationships among friends like us, I hereby give 2 weeks notice of my intention to leave this friendship. My final day of being your friend will be Friday, June 4, 2004.  I want to thank you for all that you have done for me during our time together. It has been a pleasure knowing you and learning from the rich resource of your ideas.   It is now time for me to move on and I have accepted a position with another friend. This decision was not an easy one and took a lot of consideration. However, I am confident that this new role represents a positive move towards fulfilling my future goals.   I wish you and your family continued success and once again, would like to thank you for allowing me to be a part of your life.   If there is anything I can do to assist the smooth transition of replacing me, please let me know.   Cordially, Yor Name Here
This is the funniest pic I have ever seen! Every time I see this, I start to laugh almost uncontrolably.       Just unbelieveable.      Nick, Lexie, and Tyler (Nephews & Niece)
Stop whatever it is that seems so important. Are you going to school? Skip class. Are you going to work? Call in sick. Do you or does someone you love currently have a medical emergency requiring urgent care as a matter of life or death? Wait a while. Whether you are reading this from New York City (Vincent - what's up man?) or Georgia or South Korea, Japan, The Philippines, Osteoporosis, Halitosis, or elsewhere, you need to find this drink and take it home and drink it ALL day long. A friend from Juarez, Mexico told me about this before I went to New York. He said I would like it. He was right. I should be doing homework right now, but this is a lot more interesting. Besides, I am setting the example for you to be irresponsible. Let that special person in your life down, and go ahead and search for this drink no matter what the consequences.

I took a break from studies tonight and shot these pics on my way out of Barnes & Noble here in Scottsdale, Arizona.  The first one is a pic of stairs - yes, stairs. There is something about stairs that I find very cool.  The second is kids playing in a water fountain park in Kierland Commons. It's unfortunate that the two children that happen to be looking into the camera appear to be possessed by satan. Or maybe I just need to read about shutter controls and red-eye reduction.  The pic just above is RA Sushi, a Japanese Restaraunt. Is anyone surprised that I included something Asian in this post? For sure I am going to a Japanese restaraunt for lunch tomorrow. I've been eating grapefruit and eggplant all day and if I do this again tomorrow, I may, as they say, go postal.
