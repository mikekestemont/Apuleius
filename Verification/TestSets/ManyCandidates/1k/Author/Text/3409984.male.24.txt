Assignment:  What is your "technological history"? What are your earliest memories of technology? Computers or video games or the vibrating bouncy-chair that cuddled you as a baby? What of Teddi Ruxpin? the Speak and Spell? or the See-and-Say? When did you use your first computer? What was it like? What did you do with it? What fears or phobias do you have regarding technology? computers? How does your computer function in your day-to-day life? How would your life be different without your computer? e-mail and the Internet? What would be more difficult about being a student if you didn't have computers/Internet? What would be easier?   Response:       My technology history started when I was 4.  I had this machine that looked a lot like a mini-computer, complete with a working keyboard.  On the side was a space for diskettes, and each diskette offered a game to teach me math, spelling, shapes, and U.S. states.  I don’t remember what it was called, but I loved it.  I carried it everywhere.  The constant blurps and beeps must have driven my parents crazy, but they never said so.  By the time I entered kindergarten, I could read books, identify every U.S. state, and solve basic addition problems (provided I could use my fingers and, if necessary, toes).  I also had exposure to the cutting-edge technology known as Lite-Brite.  For some reason, in my early childhood, multi-colored pegs that would light up at my discretion fascinated me.     .       In second and third grade, we spent about an hour every day in the computer lab with Ms. Clark, the computer teacher.  Ms. Clark was cross-eyed and she frightened me, but I did enjoy using the computer.  We played with a program called Logo on Apple IIE computers with green screens.  We learned how to manipulate and control the movements of a turtle on the screen, through a series of typed commands.  It was in this lab that I had my first experience with a game called “Oregon Trail.”    .  Ah, the joys of packing my 19th Century wife and kids into a covered wagon and heading out into the wild frontier, hunting for wild game, and bartering my valuables in exchange for supplies, only to have every wheel on my covered wagon break and each member of my family drop off like flies from drowning, dysentery, or diphtheria.  I enjoyed it immensely.      Around third grade, I got my first Nintendo, and Oregon Trail and other Apple computer games took a backseat for several years.  After Nintendo came Game Boy, Sega Genesis, Super Nintendo, Sony Playstation, and Nintendo 64.  I loved video games.  What’s interesting to me is that I almost completely abandoned computers in favor of video games; now I’ve almost completely abandoned video games in favor of computers.      In high school, I took a class called Computer Math.  I learned how to use the programs Basic and C++.  I began going to the public library to type papers for English classes, and while I was there, began surfing the Internet for the first time.  I was fourteen.  Although I’d had an old Apple computer at home since I turned eight, my family didn’t get online at home until after I had graduated high school.  By that time, I already had an email address, basic knowledge of how to use a search engine, and a few favorite websites.        When I came to college, I bought my own computer and had a constant Ethernet connection.  I began IM’ing people through AOL Instant Messenger, downloading music illegally, and using the Internet for school (I even took an online course).  Having my own computer definitely exposed me to the most technology at one time that I had previously been exposed to.  For most of my freshman year, if I wasn’t eating, sleeping, studying, or going out with friends, I was online in some capacity—checking my email, talking to people, surfing, or downloading.        I think I’ve actually become dependent on my computer.  As soon as I get home from anywhere, my instinctive reaction is to immediately go to my computer and check my regular sites.  Without a computer in my room, I would be lost. I rely on it for so much.  I compose most papers sitting at my computer, rarely handwriting anything first anymore.  I have several friends with which I only communicate via email or IM.  I don’t use it so much that I leave no time for reading books, going out, working, or exercising.  But it is definitely a major part of my life.        I think it would be difficult to be a student at ECU without my own computer.  I can’t imagine having to go to the library or a computer lab on campus every time I needed to look up something.  I have learned a lot from computers and I think my time online has been more valuable than wasted.
This is the blog that I am being forced to create for my ENGL 3810 Advanced Composition course at ECU.  I will be posting almost every day about writing, personal experiences, and websites.
What follows is a rhetorical précis I wrote in response to this  urlLink article .  In their essay “Public:  Take Our Privacy Please” (2001), Declan McCullagh and Ryan Sager claim that, according to polls, a vast majority of the American public does not seem to be concerned with Internet privacy.   The authors support this claim by offering data drawn from these polls, which says that while most Americans are apprehensive to reveal personal information like Social Security numbers, financial and medical information, or information about their children, most feel comfortable supplying their gender, age, education, occupation, hobbies, and interests.  The authors discuss possible future privacy legislation in order to persuade readers to think about Internet privacy and the possibility of it becoming a major issue.  The authors have an informal relationship with their audience and they present this information to readers who may not consider online privacy to be a big deal.  Personally I fall in line with that sixteen percent that is not v
