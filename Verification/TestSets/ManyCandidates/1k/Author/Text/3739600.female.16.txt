Ok well I have learned another lesson in life! A very hard one but needed! You really can't place your heart in anyones hands and not have it broken! The only one you can trust is the Lord. He knows how to treat you and he can be trusted with anything! So I am going to forgive all who have hurt me, forget it ever happened and just move on. No need to ponder anymore! I just hope that all of those I have hurt will forgive me as well! Ta-ta!          Much love, Brandi*    urlLink          urlLink
Wow, stunning how time can take a toll. If we are to deliberate ourselves and just talk about everything and anything, we are able to see through our afflictions and worries. And most of all we can work things out! In the width span of 2 1/2 hours he and I connected like never before! It felt so wonderful and traquilizing! I am so glad we had our talk. I hope on many levels we are some what closer! Time is such a vunerable yet a inpregnable tool we all use to keep order and stability. But some times just forget about all of the clocks and watches; do what ever the hell you want! Trust me, it really heals and revitalises you.  Much lov, Brandi*
Man I can't stop it. No matter how hard I try, there's no changing the way I feel. It's hopelessly sad! I can't believe I still feel this way after all that has exploded between us! Plus, truth be told, I don't think he cares much for me anymore! I'm not trying to be sarcastic/dramatic or whatever it's called! I just feel that way. I maybe wrong but I could almost promise that's what it is. Maybe that's  one  of the reasons I am joining the army!...To run away. Not only my dad but from my feels for him. I don't want to stop loving but I think it would make things easier for me. Don't ask how because I think I am just gabbering & and making up excuses! I am so sorry for all the crap he went through just to make it work. I know for a fact have said that many times before but he doesn't realize just how sorry I really am. I would cry so much when I got home, after school! I have to admit that there were many times where I wanted to give up. Not because I didn't want to be with him but because I didn't want him to go through so much shit! To me, I'm not worth all the trouble! He doesn't understand how much he means to me! And to see him go through the things he did, hurt me so much! I have never loved anybody the way I love him! I didn't even have to think twice about  us getting together! I felt so happy and comfortable around him! I told 'em things I could never tell my life long friend, to whom I have known since I was three years old! He knew me inside out and I placed all my trust and love into him. he is the best thing that has happened to me! I just can't believe it all had to end! I don't ever want to say good-bye but at the moment I don't know what to do anymore! I just want to stop hurting.....Please tell me you'll always be there for me. If not as my boyfriend, as my best friend! I promise you, I'll always be here for you. If you ever need anything or you just need to talk, don't be afraid to pull me off to the side!       Always      Brandi*
Why is it when my parents argue, it's always about me? I'll try not to complain but I just need to get things straight. I try so hard to be the perfect child both of them want me to be but it's just not me. I don't have the normal teen life all the others do. I don't go to the movies every Friday night, I don't go to the occasional birthday party, nor do I go hang out at the mall with my friends. I turn down offers to go to schlitterbahn or six flags and I barely talk on the phone anymore. I try not to ask for too much and I am always keeping to myself. But My dad just has to find something to stick on me. He always brings up the past and the stupid things I have done. Yes I know I make mistakes but with that I ask for your forgiveness and plus it's over with and he should learn to let them go. Even when I'm not bothering anybody and I am sitting in my room, he will get all upset because I am always in my room. But when I'm not in my room we always get into confrontations. So I don't know what to do. And see the worst thing is when my mom tries to stand up for me. When she does, she and my dad get in to these huge arguments. Once I turn 18, I think it were best if I were to get out of this house as soon as possible. I love my parents and you know I wouldn't be able to live knowing I split them apart. As it is I hate knowing that I am the main reason for all the tension I this house hold. So Lord, please help me and please don't leave my side.       Love Always, Brandi*

Well today is surely a lot better than yeasterday! Since&nbsp;my&nbsp;good ol' buddy Clayton&nbsp;was at work yesterday and was around some friends I really didn't bring up anything about my day! We mainly talked about all the other shit that's stinkin' up our lifes! But after I got off the phone with him&nbsp;I called another friend. At frist I was kind o
