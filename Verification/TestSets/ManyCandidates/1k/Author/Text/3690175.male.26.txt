yeah...
I just found this site.  Woundering what its all about.  hrmmm.....
this looks interesting.  http://www.valuemd.com/viewtopic.php?t=20679&sid=ac2f3c641552caa64a4a140544498d1d  I think I posted about this earlier.  Fun times ahead!  ----- edit : adding more.  So my day wasn't as productive as I had hoped it would be.  Stayed up too late last night.  Phone call from my dad early this morning and someone actually trimming down the weeds (as tall as trees) outside pretty much kept me from sleeping late.  So after lunch, I pretty much went to sleep in classroom1.  Ive become more adept at sleeping in there.  Rest of the day I spent doing something.  I can't remember.  Oh I went to class....  Went over some viruses that cause gastroenteritis.  Not many.  And went over the Hepatitis viruses and a little over immunization.  Started going over some of the non-inflammatory diarrheas as well.  A lot there ....  took me awhile to go over it.  Not much exiciting happened today.  From SDN, someone thought that there may not be any openings in the 2007 class.  No decision was made by Tulane though.  They said they let 2 people into the 2006 class though.  Pretty much a non-eventful day really.
I'll make some quick additions right now.  Need sleep basically.  Managed to wake up for my ICM lab this morning, but I was falling asleep while learning the breast and gyn exam!  I guess thats why I got picked on today to demonstrate it to the rest of the people in my lab.  Apparently my technique was good, but not the technique thats good for class :D  bought kiwi for $3 a fruit.  OUCH.
I have gas.  (P.S. - Im going to Title my posts based on how many days I have left in school down here.  I finish classes on 7/30 though.)  Test Schedule  8/10 - ICM lab practical exam 8/18? - some mysterious shelf exam (new dean and is $#^#$^6 policies) 8/19 - local final exam.  Now its about 30 questions per class, and each might count around 45% of my grade .....  uhh.  yeah.  8/24 leave island for last time 8/28 wedding in san juan 8/29 finally get home 9/6? drive out to south beach, FL
So I had my 2nd assigned hospital day today.  For some reason I always think that the bus leaves at 8:30 am to leave for the hospital in the capital, abuot an hour's drive.  So anyways,  I barely made it again to the bus.  I got there just after 8.  I was assigned to ENT today, Ears, Nose and Throat, for those that don't know.  The doctor showed up about 90 mins late. We didn't waist that 90 mins.  Spent that time going over micro with the rest of the people in my group.   That 90 mins was taken away from our LUNCH time.  He's supposed to let us go between noon and 12:30.  So we can go fetch lunch, usually at the fort young hotel.  Which for this island, has some decent food.  But today he didn't let us out until 1:40 ish.  We are supposed to meet for our afternoon session at 1:45...  We were PISSED and starving.  So we were told to go to the hospital cafeteria, CANTEEN here.  They had nothing but crap.  So I got some fake cheetos and a coke.  Afternoon session wasn't too bad.  Had someone come in with a UMN lesion and spastic paresis, and 2 individuals with a ventricular septal defect.  One had a palpable thrill, and the other had a murmur.  Still can't tell the difference between systolic and diastolic murmurs.  Or crescendo/decrendo stuff.  I  know the PDA murmur though :D    Just glad I never have to go down to that hospital again!  I've got 2 weeks until the next exam.  Much work to be done, which I'll get around too in a bit once I shower and head over to school.  Needed to unwind a little from today.  Looks like my apartment is all squared away for miami.  Should have the application and fee in today.  On a side note, I was reminded that I should be hearing about Tulane soon.  Within a week or two.  They should hear about their grades soon and will know how many openings they will have for their 2007 class.  Not sure what else to add.  Anyways, time to hit that shower.
Ok, not that I have some time to sit down, I think its time that I post something real. Got too caught up doing renal and GIT pathology yesterday to get on and post on here. Still really behind in pathology.  My full day of hospital rotation tommorow doesn't help matters either.  We've covered the Intestinal tract, liver+biliary, pancreas, male and female reproductive and are now starting renal.  I haven't even touched pancreas, male and female pathology yet.  And I still have to learn renal, breast and endocrine for this next test (in 2 weeks!).  :( We have yet to start pharmacology classes either for this next test.  Its a lot of endocrine associated drugs.  So I hope my physiology is up to par ... Almost done with microbiology.  Some repetition luckily though.  But still a lot of work. Im still lost in ICM (aka Physical Diagnosis).  Classes seem like a waist of time, but I can't find anything out there to read for the test.  The people who do well in this class are those who were ER techs, nurses, PAs, etc.  Its complete BS.  Ive finally found a place to live in miami.  Its called Ludlam Point,    It seems to be very close to some places I need to go to often.   Ive also been looking into review courses for the USMLE Step 1 exam.  Im almost certain I'll be signing up for this falcon review course located in Dallas, TX. Just seems it'll be easier for me to study while there.  Course info is located at http://www.falconreviews.com  Not much as happened here.  Drama in the bookstore.  Some pyscho woman, from my class, had a problem with the refund policy of the store.  Ordered a book expecting to get i
