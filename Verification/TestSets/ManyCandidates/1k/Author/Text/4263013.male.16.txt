hi there.. i'd start to write another story about a young boy with his new born baby brother... he's family was so glad that their new baby have perfect health.. they all happily walked home that day.. days passed by and the baby grew.. after a month, the little baby got sick.. worried, his parents bought their baby to the hospital where the baby was born.. the doctor checked the baby for a few moments.. then after a time that felt like forever, the doctor blurted out the truth.. the baby had a very rare disease that kills its patients in days.. the only way to keep the baby alive is that to bring it in the intensive care unit and have a blood transfusion.. the baby is too young to have the operation and may cause him his death but the parents chose to do the operation.. the operation was successful, the baby did not die but he was losing strength.. the baby was weakening every moment.. the doctor told their family that they are still going to lose their baby and there is no more hope left.. the young boy, not knowing that his brother is already dying went to his father and told him, "i want to sing a song for my brother..". his dad bought him to his brother but the nurse said, "he is not allowed here sir, i'm sorry..". the young boy's dad got angry and without thinking, bought his son to their dying baby.. before the nurse could say anything, the young boy started to sing.. "good morning my baby, let me light up your life.. dont leave me be so i wont cry.." then, the baby lost his heartbeat.. at this moment, his parents cried but his brother still kept on singing.. "good morning my baby, let me light up your life.. dont leave me be so i wont cry.." suddenly, the baby gained back his heartbeat, his purple colored skin slowly turned back to normal.. everyone in the room got shocked and told the young boy that, "sing and continue to sing Micheal.. sing the beautiful song to your brother so that he may be happy.." at this moment, the baby has his skins color back to normal.. then the baby gained conciousness and started to cry..  we may think that a simple song may not make a person bring back his life but the prayer that comes with it is the reason of the miracle.. God is good and he will give you what you want if you just pray..
every single day i think of you.. every single moment i admire you.. every single hour i remember you.. every single second my heart beats for you..  i don't know why but these are all true.. even though we are really far away from each other my love for you will always be true...  you may think that these things can stop and end in a single day that i may get tired of loving you but that isnt going to happen.. because my love will never fail nor vanish in an instant..  i just want to tell you something that i really do.. it is a thing that matters for me and you i love you and no one else can ever take that love away from me..
