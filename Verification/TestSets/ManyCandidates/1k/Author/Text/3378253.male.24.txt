"I will always see you marching in the Ghost Parade" - - Remember the Ocean - _tomorrow after dark_  It's apt, really, Kristin. I don't know if it's at all what you meant, but I can feel the trailing fingertips of all the people walking by so long after I said goodbye. Not ghosts, per se. Although the dead share this path too, and mix between the long-lost without regard or distinction; makes me fear, somehow, for loved ones who've not yet left the land, only my life.  Behind closed eyes they creep, slow paced and steady with the inexhaustible strength of my regret. In the quiet moments when I'm trying not to be blinded by the sun, they pass before me with reproach in their eyes. They stand apart from each other, most of them, to leave room for me, right there beside. Every one of them reminds me, silently and angrily, that I left them there. Nights hold no rest.
I was confused this morning. No messages from you. Not one. Couldn't figure out what I'd done, why you suddenly were ignoring me. Took me a moment 'til I realized that it was only in my dreams that we'd been talking again, like before.        [No poetry. No hyperbole. No art. Just truth.]
I want you to know a few things, chief among which is that you are, I believe, wrong. I haven't listened to your voicemail yet, because honestly, I don't want to know for sure what you think. I have my assumption, which may well be wrong, but I am working from it because I want to tell you something that is, in fact, kind of rare in my life. So often I hide one thing or more, only show one side of my life, all that sort of thing. I want to tell you the whole truth.   But, first and foremost - my friend's visit is entirely unrelated to what happened between you and I. I know you don't believe that, and I know that's my fault. But it's true.   Anyway.     		_the truth_   	M______, who came to visit this weekend, is a friend of mine, and a sometime "friend with benefits."  	[No; never, ever, ever while I was with you. And never would have been. Never.] 	She and I had "hooked up" once before you and I were together; neither of us wanted any sort of serious relationship in our lives, so it was just that. Day-to-day, we are just friends. We email most days, talk probably once a week. Nothing sexual at all, because we really are ~friends~. There was, though, always the understanding that when we saw each other again, if neither of us was in any kind of relationship, we'd like to hook back up as well as just hang out. The one topic of conversation we never got on was relationships - I never asked her if she was dating anybody, and she never asked me. You assume the other person is, and behave accordingly, but it's not anything you talk about. So no, I'd never told her about you. I'd been trying to get up the nerve to tell her before her visit when things between you and I came to a head.  	I believe, right now, that you think I broke up with you so I could be with her. I want to be hurt by that, and I am, but I'm fully aware it's my own fault for lying to you about this weekend. 	The fact of the matter is that, had things between you and I not gone the way they did, I'd've told her I was seeing someone, and she and I were going to be ~only~ friends this weekend. She would still have come to visit, and that'd be that. We'd've hung out. Again, truth here: I would not have told you that she and I had been together before. The past being the past, and immaterial, I'd feel, to what you and I were. Also, I have assumed that the whole "friends with benefits" thing would not be well-receieved here, so I've hid that, too. I thought it was something you (and everyone here in this small town) would dislike me for. I am ... horribly sorry for lying to you. I've been more wholly truthful with you than I have with almost anyone else in my life, but some things I came in to our relationship already having decided weren't something to share in this town. By the time you and I were more serious and I was more comfortable, some things had already been established, either already said or just an idea and stance I'd put solidly into place in my mind, and I didn't know how to bring them back about. 	Anyway - like I said. My sexual relationship with M______ was before my time with you. My friendship with her was current. The possibility of sex was there for some futures. It was never, ever a part of my day to day relationship with her.  	I broke up with you for all the reasons I said, and nothing more. I know that the timing and the fact that I lied about her visit makes it look like something other than that, but it's entirely coincidental - I broke up with you because of the conversation we had the day before, not because of plans for the weekend. 	 	As I'm writing this, I know that you will not believe it. I'm angry at myself, for treating you so badly that you do not believe I loved you. I'm nauseous at the thought.  	I'm not dating anyone else. So, presumeably, the only reason to break up with you for someone else would be sex. Do you remember our time together? Do you remember how I treated you in bed? Honestly, do you think I am motivated by wanting sex? 	I don't know. Obviously you do. Obviously, like I said, my fault. 	Yeah, I enjoy the hell out of sex - who doesn't? But it's n
