I am going to make an effort to be brutally honest on this thing. I figure, why have a record of what's going on in my life, if it isn't really what's going on in my life? There are things about ourselves that we don't always want people to know - especially the people we're closest to. The ones we're afraid of dissapointing (Hi, Mom and Dad) But I don't want to fudge the truth anymore because I'm worried about what someone will think of me. Everyone has faults. Everyone makes mistakes. And I hope that the people I love will still love me, even if they know all about the stupid or thoughtless or shallow things I sometimes do.  So, I've been having a few interpersonal problems at work. Its a long and boring story I may write later. I'm not the most well socialized person, I don't deal well with confrontation or difficult situations, I don't know what say to people a lot of the time. Sometimes I'm too sensitive, and I'm always way too insecure. I know I'm an emotional coward and my preferred method of dealing with personal problems is to ignore them in the hopes they'll dissapear.    PC BAHNGS   The PC bahng I frequent now has a non-smoking section, with nice little sign hanging above it. Before, you were free to light up wherever - the owner would bring you an ashtray (a paper cup with a bit of water in it). Now, however, the government says they've gotta be 50 percent smoke free. So we've got a smoking section for one aisle of computers, and a nonsmoking section in the other aisle.  For those of you not in Korea, a PC bahng is an internet cafe. Some are pretty nice inside, others are a little dingy. All of them are pretty cheap. The general price here in Jecheon is 1000 won/hour. And you can smoke, eat and drink in them. Which was a nice change when I got here, after having been subject to the U of C info commons' absolutely no food or drinks at the computer stations policy. Most of the people who come here either play games, or chat online. Or look at porn - anyways, whoever was at this station before me was - I went to type in an address and the address bar showed someone had visited lesbian free pics or something.  Generally, I love PC bahngs. They're cheap, open 24 hours a day, have fast internet access, there are tons of them wherever you go, and you can eat and drink in them. Lately, though, I'm not liking them so much. It could be because its the rainy season, and half the time I go, I get drenched on the way home because I didn't bring a jacket or umbrella. Or maybe it could be the way three little kids will sneak up behind you and stare at you and whatever you're doing. And then giggle and run away - or giggle and not run away. Or the constant barrage of twenty people playing games and music with the sound cranked up. Its probably all these things. And the keyboard condoms.  I was planning on waiting until I got home to buy a laptop, but I think that I may see if I can get one in Seoul this week. I'm a little scared though - I know fuck-all about computers. Except - windows is evil, and Bill Gates is the antichrist. At least, that was what I learned in the few CPSC 231 lectures I was awake for.   MY DAD   My Dad is riding his bike across Canada. I think its fucking fabulous. It's a supported trip - Mom is driving a trailer so he doesn't have to haul all his gear. He started in Prince Rupert I think, and is somewhere in BC or Alberta right now. They sent me some pictures that I'll post if I ever figure how to do anything on this other than type. I showed them to some friends I was out with. One said he would love to meet my Dad - that he sounded like a really cool guy and looked very Zen. Of course, a Korean friend also said that she would love to meet him so she could take a picture with him and tell everyone she met Santa (his hair is white and he has a beard). I love you Dad - you rock!
Okay, so this is my first attempt at creating a blog, and it may crash and burn miserably. Anyone out there who might read this - please be kind. We are all beginners at some point.  Today is the first day of the my eight days of vacation. I'm heading off to Seoul tomorrow with A and YJ. The intention is to see some interesting stuff (museums, palaces, whatever) but I have a feeling its going to turn into one long night of partying punctuated by a few shopping expeditions. We're going to hook up with some of her friends and stay with them. I feel a bit awkward crashing at a strangers house...but not awkward enough to pay for a yogwan if I don't have to.
So...I'm home. Ahhsssah! I left Korea at 6:30pm on aug 23, and I got to Calgary at...6:30 pm aug 23. The flight I came on was originally scheduled to leave at 4:40. When I called to confirm my flight, they said it had been changed to 5, and when I checked in at the airport, they said 6:10, but we didn't get off the ground for another twenty minutes.  The flight itself was fine. When we landed in Vancouver it was around 1 in the afternoon. Great, I though, I have plenty of time to relax before I catch my flight to Calgary at 4. But. We sat on the tarmac waiting to be "de-planed" for fifteen minutes. Why couldn't we get off? Because they needed to have someone check these SARS forms we all had t
