Author:  Martin Clark  Genre:  Fiction/Mystery/Humor   Review:  I'm utterly blown away by the wit and creativity of Clark as showcased in this book.  While it is a long read, 345 unapologetic action-filled pages, I started it last night at around ten and finished it this morning at ten.  It was so enthralling that I refused to go to sleep until I'd finished it.  { Warning: no real criticism or analysis follows as this is a book I WANT you to read.  No synopsis for you, bub .}  Clark casts a brave band of f.u.b.a.r'd misfits (a judge, his brother--the philosophist [translation: poor asshole living in a trailer], a doctor, and the happily-married friend) as the adventure-goers (though they smoke so much weed it makes me wonder now if any of the plot actually happened or if the characters were merely hallucinating).  Our brave band of merry men find themselves everywhere from just across the Virginia border for lotto tickets, Charleston, West Virginia, Climax, North Carolina (yes, a real place) and Salt Lake City, where the plot thickens (trite description, I know--shush it).  The characters were well-developed, the dialogue didn't drag on until the cows came home, and Clark didn't try to interfuse some moralistic theme into the works (As of late the convention of teaching lessons in novels really pisses me off--just tell a story and move on.  If I wanted salvationist reading I'd go to Wal-Mart and buy  Left Behind ).  What I really enjoyed about the book is that the protagonist Evers actually gets revenge on his tramp skank skeezer (excuse my French) of a wife in the end--I appreciated that Clark gave the reader the satisfaction of that rather than including some absurd plot twist just for the sake of innovation.   How  he inevitably gets his revenge encompasses the back half of the book (which explains why I didn't make it to bed).  I kept trying to guess what was going to happen, which is typically disgustingly easy in most books, and found myself surprised each time.  I must admit that the humor is tongue-in-cheek: if you don't understand sarcasm, you'll hate this book (because you won't get it).  I must further admit that while the book was written by a judge, don't expect anything in it to be clean.  In fact, it was downright vulgar and I LOVED IT!  Religious zealots beware.   Verdict:     This is the sort of writer I aspire to be: at no point did I secondguess the quality of the book.  The story was solid from beginning to end--the man is sharp as a tack.  Go pick it up in paperback as a summer beach read.
Author:  Melanie Sumner  Genre:  Mainstream Fiction   Review:   "Never judge a book by its cover," the old adage goes.  I did, and I'm sorry.   The School of Beauty and Charm  was an impulse grab at the library.  I didn't read much of the jacket synopsis, other than to know it was by a Southern woman writer (my academic concentration).  I added it to my pile, regardless of the odd cover art which at first created in me some doubt as of the competence of the book.  This book may be the most well-written and thoughtful works I've engaged in to date.  The writing was clean and cohesive with little waste.  While there was nothing excessive about Sumner's descriptive passages, I came away feeling like I had somehow heard of the characters before--as if they were living in my town and I'd heard gossip about them through the grapevine on occasion.  Sumners has a gifted ear and is obviously a seasoned studier of people.  She spins dialect idiosyncrasies and social norms into the make-up of the characters so well as to be describing people she knows in life.   The School of Beauty and Charm  tells the story of the Peppers family: "new money" in the Counterpoint, Georgia social scene (they are, in fact, po' white trash ascended to semi-prominence).  It is the coming-to-age saga of the protagonist Louise is a delightful, down-to-earth, troubled (read: normal) teenager who rebels by going through such interesting phases as "redneck tart," "bohemian," and "carnie."  She hates her parents.  She loves her parents.  Her mother is a Christian (a Southern  Baptist  Christian--uh oh!).  Her father is a sheep whom follows the nagging shepherding of his wife.  There's so much to be understood in the text that I could read it again and again and each time come away with a different explication of why something occurred in such a way: the stuff good "literature" is made of.  The many twists in plot are so unexpected that at times, I sat agape wondering, "How'd she think to do that?  Bravo!"  Inevitably the book is a discussion of whom Louise chooses to love and where she finds them.  My favorite happened to be the fire-eating Zane whom himself is so sexually repressed that his final action in story floored me.  I'll admit that I didn't get the title until I got to the very end of the book, and I'll leave it to your discretion to determine whether you'll want to learn for yourself what the school actually is.   Verdict:     Top honors: it takes a while to get into the meat of the plot, but is absolutely worth reading.
Author:  Clyde Edgerton  Genre:  Mainstream Fiction   Review:   Those whom have read  urlLink my blog , and more recently this location, have understood that my relationship with Edgerton's books is usually hit or miss.  I keep going back and reading more of them because a) I have a fierce loyalty to North Carolina writers, and b) I really enjoyed his   Walking Across Egypt   and   Killer Diller  .  That said, I must confess that I really disliked  In Memory of Junior .  ["Hate" is such a strong word and I shall reserve it for a book that really makes me grind my teeth in disgust.]  This, as well as other Edgerton books, are marked as being humorous.  I found nothing to laugh at in this work.  While  Lunch at the Piccadilly  was l
