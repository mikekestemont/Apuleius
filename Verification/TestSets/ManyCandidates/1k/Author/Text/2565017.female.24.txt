urlLink Visit Finland   This piece is not literally of the planet Mars and the life there may or may not be. By Mars I mean a figure of speech, any place that we know exists but we don't know it very well.... in this case, I'm going to make Finland less of a Mars to you.  Let's clear up a few clichés to begin with.... 1) Finland is no situated in the Arctic or the Antarctic 2) Therefore, we do not live in small no-electricity huts with polar bears walking in our streets. 3) The official home of Father Christmas / Santa Claus is Finland. 4) Nokia is (or was, now the actual owners are mostly foreign) a Finnish company, not Japanese. 4) As I had to tell a pen pal in USA a few years back: Finland isn't a part of England, somewhere near Scotland.  But those were only the stuff that is common knowledge, except to the majority of USA citizens. No offence intended.  I'm going to by category, sort of, the first one was the clichés, apparently...   urlLink Cities   The most well known city to those who know little of Finland is our capital Helsinki. I have to be really lame now, and confess that I don’t know much about Helsinki and I’ve only visited there properly once. A few other cities (or towns they might be if you think world-scale) are more familiar to me.  Well, the town I’ve lived close by for the most of my life is Turku, which is situated in the south-eastern coast, east from Helsinki. Turku Archipelago is very famous and I’m fortunate to have lived right inside it, in a small village, on a small island right next to mainland. Turku is a very nice town with a river crossing through it. Lots of student life there, because of the University and the few collages and many high schools. As any city in Finland, it is at its prime at summer.   urlLink Pics of Turku    urlLink Pics of my childhood village . That's how the Turku Archipelago looks like.  Then there’s a lovely, a lot smaller town Kajaani, in the northern Finland. I studied business and administration there for 2 years before I decided to change my field of studying. It’s a very nice small town too, with a lot of park area, a river, a big lake and rural area and forests surrounding it.    urlLink Pics of Kajaani   And finally, my current place of residence, Savonlinna, which is situated a little bit to east from Mikkeli. (You’re able to spot Mikkeli in the map of Finland, w
