Hmmm . . . bleh
hello blog,how are ya today?was working yesterday,and was planning to go to the cinema on my lonesome afterwards,but mike insisted on going too because he thought the idea of someone going on their own was stupid . . . its the cinema,why would you want to go with other people when you arent actually gonna talk to them?!then dandering about the town afterwards we encountered a drunken luke, a drunken gary, a drunken robb and nicola and lynsey(dunno if they were drunk) so luke and gary tagged along too.luke went out with 10quid,and now he has 11quid,after getting loads of drink, going to the cinema and getting loads of ridiculously priced cinema food . . . i think in his drunkeness he mightve performed aural sex on gary for money,he cant quite remember . . . saw shaun of the dead again, not as good second time round,but still good.oh, and it was robbs birthday,and i completely forgot about it,thats what he gets for being a dick : P oooh,on thursday i was all happy because i got 2 letters in the post, TWO LETTERS!!!!!!!wow,i felt so grown up and mature and great and stuff : P and then i opened one of them and it was getting my birth certificate back from my drivers license thingy,so i was all happy cause i felt even more grown up cause im getting a drivers license!hooray for mark!and then just as i was all happy and stuff i opened the next one . . . an appointment with a cardiologist in newry hospital for an echocardiograph(what?!) : | a real anti-climax to my letter opening adventures.the stupid people in the doctors told me i was all ok and stuff the day before, and then i get that,so maybe im gonna die after all.my pains have sort of gone down anyway,so it could just be growning pains(on the heart?).blah blah,ill be fine.  http://pub208.ezboard.com/ffastfude31550fastfudenewsboard.showMessage?topicID=13676.topic  i was just told about this,the arcade in belfast burnt down.thats the place with rip-off clothing and darkstorm records.Biggy also owned a spice shop in there and a practice hall with loads of equipment in it.oh, and a pet shop . . . poor wee animals.sucks.
Guess what,i was up early today!It's 12o'clock now, and i've been up for about and hour and a half!im not usually up for another hour or two!hmmm,hopefully im gonna get lots of work done today.bah,dad wants me to cut the lawn,no chance of that happening though. im in a crappyish mood today,because its so nice outside,and im gonna be stuck inside all day working.i just wanna start walking again,but im gonna resist the urges.hmmm,not much to report really,im boreded.im just in one fo those moods that im always in,as if somethings eating me up inside and i cant figure out what it is(although most of the times i do know what it is,im just ignoring it).sucks.
hmmm,easter still sucks,although not as much,because i sorted things out with suzanne (even though there wasnt anything to sort of,i was just being a dick)  which made me a lot happier.still miss her though. i did work yesterday!a whole day of pure hardcore unadulterated work!(?)im very happy with myself because of it, and last night me and john d rented a game out (XIII) and went to his house and played it.oh yes,gary came too . . . ok,i quite like the guy now,although that is very likely to change the next time he talks to me aboput how drunk he got or how stoned he got or how many girls he's "had" and are "demons in the sack,nba", but for last night he was ok.except, we got a two player game out, and with gary there was 3 of us,yes, i am very selfish when it comes to games : P oh, and XIII has the best sniper rifle in any shoot-em-up ive ever played . . . *ahem*  the night before(tuesday night?) i just stayed in on my own and watched black hawk down,i didnt wanna go out or do anything.before these holidays id almost forgotten how good staying in on your own,or with one of two friends and just watching a movie/playing a game etc etc,i havent been able to do that since ive been working at tescos,because i get so few weekend nights off i always feel that i NEED to go out and do something,so it wont be a wasted,even though i probably would have less fun than i would staying in . . . im just stupid.  gonna do more work today!ive also got to work at tescos tonight, even though they said they would give me thursday night off,but i dont think they are now,methinks they just said that they say theyre gonna give me it off just to keep me happy,but they arent really,so im gonna threaten to quit tonight,which would make me very happy,because then i could revise loads more for exams and still have more free time.who needs money?!
hmmm, Therapy? - Infernal love(the whole album, not just the song). Very good for moi atm,very broody yet very good music with lots of depth . . .yar : (
Taken for granted?feels like it.hmmm,easter sucks, ive said it before and ive said it again.i really wish suzanne would just sort out her problem with david,throw the guy away or something.her being so depressed is really eating at me and it pisses me off as do a lot of other things so im generally a very pissed off guy at the minute.i cant even do school work because everytime i sit down i start to think of something that pisses me off.  hmm, suzanne i miss you and i dont care if you dont miss me because you "dont miss people" even though you've told me you miss me lots of times before.yes,im probably really unfair and being a bastard and stuff because she's going through a hard time,but its just annoying that she keeps on letting david hurt her,even though she was saying about how she got annoyed a
