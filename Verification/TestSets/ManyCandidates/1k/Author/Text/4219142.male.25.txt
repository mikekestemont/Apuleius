I must say that writing a blog is very liberating.  I felt so good to have some kind of outlet, besides music, to express my inner thoughts.  I don't know if this will go anywhere, but I know I'm gonna have fun with it.  It's my time to shine...  On the music front...      I was just bumpin' the new Writer's Block album and I must say that it's more than I expected.  Not to say I thought it was gonna suck, but DAMN, it's got some tight production on there, courtesy of KeyKool, Rhettmatic, Mum's The Word and some new cat I haven't even heard called Omid.  The two songs he did, Sunset Limited and Situations, are SICK!!!  I would definitely keep an eye on this kid.  He got fire.       I've been findin' myself keepin' it old school lately, so I've been listenin' to A Tribe Called Quest a lot.  To those that don't know, do the knowledge.  And to those that DO know and ask what album was their best, I got two words for you...Midnight Marauders.  From beginning to end, classic.  'Nuff said...      Also, check out Time Machine's "Slow Your Roll", one of my nominee's for album of the year, no doubt.  They take the old funkiness of early nineties Hip Hop and make it sound new.  Not too  many cats can do that.  I met them at one of their shows not long ago and they are some of the coolest muthafuckas I ever met.  They are definitely holdin' it down.      Speakin' of classic material, if you find ANYTHING by my man J-Zone, buy it.  Don't even second guess yourself.  But especially make sure you cop "Pimps Don't Pay Taxes."  Life changin' stuff... He is one of the most original dudes I've heard in a minute.      I got some other heat, but that's comin' later...  On the gamin' front...      I've been playin' Prince Of Persia (again), and Metroid Prime (again).  I can't wait for their respective sequels in November.  Speakin' of which, is it just me or is this gonna be THE MOST craziest year for games.  Let me break it down for ya...besides the two titles I just mentioned: Metal Gear Solid 3, Halo 2, Gran Turismo 4, Ratchet And Clank 3, Doom 3 (XBox), T.H.U.G. 2, KOTOR 2, Half-Life 2 (eventually), and not to mention the ton of quality games that are out now that I don't even know when I'll get to play.  So little time...  On the romance tip...(maybe)      I work in an environment where I'm constantly on the phone with people.  But today I spoke with someone that was special.  Her name is Giselle and she is one of the sweetest girls I've spoken with in a while.  I've never met her in person, but I've seen her before and WOW.  She literally took my breath away when I saw her.  She is that beautiful.  I had to place an order with her company and I got the lucky chance of speakin' with her and she is something else.  I just tried to make small talk with her and we started to talk about other things.  It was cool the way she let me joke around with her, too.  Maybe she speaks like that with others during the day, but we spoke for a good while and she is mad cool.  I'm not sayin' this is going anywhere, but only time will tell and I must say that I'd be a fool not to try.  I was gonna ask her to lunch on Monday, but I thought maybe she would think I was bein' pushy.       I must admit that it is a breath of fresh air to meet a girl that is so beautiful physically, but yet isn't so conceited or thinks she's the shit and feels that she is too good to talk to someone.  And when I say beautiful, I mean model beautiful.  No joke.  Like I told my friend, there are probably some girls that I might find attractive, but he won't like 'em and vice versa.  But this is a girl that definitely would turn ANY guy's head.  On a scale of 1 to 10, she's 25.  I was tryin' to find out if she had a man, but I couldn't get the goods.  My gut tells me no, but maybe that's just what I'm HOPING for.       Wish me luck...  One last thing...      If ANYBODY reads this, I'll be at Elements here in L.A. (Hollywood, to be exact) on Sunday.  For those that don't know, it's a Hip Hop club that goes down the 1st and 3rd Sunday of the month.  Anyway, I don't know what I'll be wearin', but most likely look for a San Diego Charger throwback jersey with #21 on it (my man L.T.!!!).  If for some reason someone reads this and just HAPPENS to be there, keep an eye out for me and say what's up.  It's my birthday the next day, but I won't be able to party then, so I gotta do it this weekend.  Lord help me... Hold ya heads and PEACE...

Hello...and welcome to my blog (obviously). I hope this is the start of somethin' special that will change some things in my life as I am in a state of transition (more on that later). This is somewhat new to me and I will try to be as entertaining as possible. I am not computer illiterate, but I am also not completely computer savvy, but I know enough to get by on. I will (hopefully) add some new type of content later, like a moblog, audio links stuff like that for you guys if you want to get a peek at my life a
