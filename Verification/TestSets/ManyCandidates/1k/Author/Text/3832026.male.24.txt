Overslept today.... woke up at 0630, take a quick shower and reach camp at 0745. Whole day was sitting in the office still not doing much.. i refuses to do anything...except maybe for my beloved handing/taking over report. Was initially against the idea of doing juz a report, after all i'm juz a small fry, kind of stupid. But then again, i decided to do a extremely detail one which inculdes all my job-scope and a step by step idiots guide to doing my job.   Well..... went to chong pang wif sam & yuanjing this afternoon for lunch. Feel abit guilty coz i'm always critisting the&nbsp;those who always&nbsp;go out of camp to lunch. But hey... i'm going to ord.. so who cares... ord rulz...haahaa...  These few day, ariff is really aiming me to help out in the orientation of the new drivers. He send an email to everyone but me, saying he wants me in for orientation as he feels jeremy is really to take over and that he need the sect comd for LRI check. Much to my surprise, yuanjing shown me the mail & reply that he does not wants me to go for orientation and that I'm already clearing my offs/leave. Was rather happy he finally made a stand. First time he actually protected his own assistant. In the end, the small boy made the final decision that I'll will not go for orientation. Ariff doesn't seems to give up, bump into him at the loading this morning and he starts asking me abt details of my off and my actual ord date... I juz mumble something abt ording next month &amp; disappear...haa...  I really dunno what's wrong with my neck.. it's still soo stiff and i juz cannot bend my head. It really very disprutive to my daily life...&nbsp;I've changed my sleeping position and i even apply those muscle rub...nothing seems to work... arrgh...
Spend the day lazing ard... playing games as usual, got a phone call frm maurice. Dunno why he keeps asking me to go his house 2 play a computer game... i wonder what kind of kind is it... Anyway met up wif him at bukit panjang plaza juz now. He keeps going for details these past few weeks due to shortage of drivers at his place... haa... Well, he's involved in this Multi-Level-Marketing (MLM) business & he wants me to join him. Spend an hour plus trying to explain 2 me the concept &amp; how it can be a career. Well, somehow i'm juz dun find it feasible. Part-time..yes, full time job... no way....  Today further strengthens my belives that i'm going to be transported back in time... 2 years back before NS. My mum is starting his nagging all over again. Shes keeps nagging at my health. Somehow I got the impression that she thinks her son is very weak. This really angers me... I'm begining to think that's the reason why i didn't choose to stay out even when i had the chance... Geez... she keeps treating me like a child... I'm already 23 for goodness sake......
Back at coy line again today.... well guess what... i really dunno what's OC or csm is thinking... they've got themselve another ops spec asst... so that makes 2 ops spec asst for Yuanjing. Hu Wei Xiang is the chosen one. Yuanjing's got to be the envy of the battalion now... 2 assistance... Apparently csm wants Weixiang to be a backup incase Jeremy's strange illness acted up again, I personally think he just wants another person to help him "gather all the shit" So now i have 2 understudy... I already cannot cope with one, I really dunno how 2 teach weixiang...   Watever.... As Chin Kok says "When the time has come for you 2 go, u just go" With only 3days left, I must say&nbsp;95% into the&nbsp;ord mood. I was just sitting around, chit chating infront of everybody, it's like there really nothing they can do 2 u... haahaa... whatever things that needs to be done, i juz aim either one of my understudies 2 do. Raymond says i'm acting like a supervisor now...haa  I think i'm going crazy liao, everytime i log on to the internet, i keep looking at the website of my future university. Haahaa, I'm looking at accomodations, travel, food, lifestyle... it's like i juz can't wait to fly there right now!&nbsp; I'm planning my budget, thinking of what to bring there & everything....I'm juz sooo excited &amp; full of anticipation. somebody pls.... help me... haa
Duties nowadays are slowly becoming a chore... it's getting harder & harder to do when ppl dun give a damn about whatever instructions u gave abt book in timing etc... I was rather pissed off this abt this... so I wrote an email addressing my concerns to all the ppl performing COS duty... but... 3SG Chan juz had to shown my half page long complains to our beloved csm... geez.... what an idiot....   Anyway... Jeremy seems to have finally cure himself of his "critital" illness.. he appear today & I was giving him the full course of my job... i juz sit there &amp; made him do everything...&nbsp;I think he's starting to wake up & smell the flowers that my job is not as easy &amp;&nbsp;"do nothing" as what some higher authority&nbsp;has said...&nbsp;maybe becos i'm quite strict & my "black" face was showing... cannot help it, I really need to whack him in shape. With Yuanjing going for Wallaby in Oct &amp; there's this chance he might be BME Ops Spec... Jeremy has really got alot to do... I really need to set his foundation right...  Today I had this thought... our coy seems rather petty... they like to fuss over small issues. Quek was been charged 7days SOL for running 3rounds instead of 4rounds...then there was this stupid issue over the level 2 toilet this afternoon abt who can & who cannot use the toilet... it's really quite stupid... Bigger issues like Hamdan's incident, Zul lost a logbook etc...are left hanging &amp; unsolved... this w
