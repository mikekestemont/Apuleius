Then I must remember there'll be days like this   -Oh, love is real enough, you will find it some day, but it has one arch-enemy - and that is life. -- Jean Anouilh, Ardele   ~I know someday you'll have a beautiful life.I know you'll be a star in somebody else's sky but why, why, why can't it be, oh, can't it be mine?   -There is only one happiness in life,to love and be loved   ~you said you never wanted to see me get hurtsoo did you just close your eyes when you made me cry?   -you asked what was wrong, i smiled and said nothing...then you turned away, a tear fell down my face and i wispered, everything   ~it takes someone special to make you laugh...   but it takes someone really special to make you laugh   when you have tears in your eyes   -You learn to like someone when you find out what makes them laugh, but you learn to love someone when you find out what makes them cry.    ~tears are words the heart cant say   -i walk in the rain . . swim in the pool . . i pretend im sleeping    soo noone notices that im really crying cuz of you   ~i'll be smiling when i see you    The tears wont ever show    i know i'll always love you    And yet you'll never know    -Take the blinders from your eyes, take the padding from your ears, and confess you've seen me crying, and admit you've seen my tears     ~I'm trying really hard not to cry over you cause every tear is just one more reminder that I don't know how to let you go     -Inside I’m slowing dying but the rain will hide my crying    ~The weirdest thing happend to me the other morning...I woke up with tears in my eyes....and one rollling down my cheek...and I knew I must have been dreaming of you again.    -have you ever had that empty feeling` inside of you...   ..like no one cares or loves you back feeling,    as if you would of c r i e d .. no one -    would be there to wipe away the *tears*    ~ I couldn’t help it when I started to cry      I told myself life’s a lie      You know love sucks when your dreams slip away      I’d trade all my tomorrows for one yesterday    -Life goes on the same, bury the pain    And hold on to love    Hear the song, sing along    But what does it change    Oh this life is so confusing    Feels like I'm always losing    ~*Let me ruin your life, let me break your heart, then I'll ask you why we can't be friends.

I know that other post was kinda depressing and im sorry if i made any of you sad or w/e but i dunno it just helped me to get it kinda outta my system... ttyl love ya more than you know, ............... well here are some more 'up beat' ones...  The real test of friendship is: Can you literally do nothing with the other person? Can you enjoy together those moments of life that are utterly simple? They are the moments people look back on at the end of life and number as their most sacred experiences.

Why were you on my mind? I’m not really sure The answers I want to findA friend you are to me This I’ll always treasure How much I’ve thought of you lately I just could not measure  If it weren't for you, where would I be? I truly do not know But I just hope you all can see Each day, our closeness grows You cheered me up with smiles Or hugs filled up with love And as the time goes by, every day.. You're the ones I'm thinking of Of course when many years go by We'll remember all the times. When we encountered crushes, parties, break-ups, pick-up lines. All of those make up the memories of true best friends And now I know deep in my heart Our trust will never end.  You are what a friend should be Someone honest and someone true You've always been there to lend a shoulder Whenever I've been feeling blue. You've been there to make me laugh When I am not in a good mood You're so kind and considerate So polite and never rude You've been there when I need advice Whether its about family or boys We've known each other since we little kids Since kinder w
