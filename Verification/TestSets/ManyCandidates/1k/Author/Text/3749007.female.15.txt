Alright..I'm gonna be gone for a week, so I won't be able to talk to anyone...for those few of you who read my blog, I'll miss you bunches!!! Isn't it weird how you feel like you have just seen a person when you haven't seen them in like a month..it's just knowing that you've talked to them for a few hours, and it seems to make up all the time...I'm glad I've talked to some of you though. I don't know what I'd do w/o MSN msg.  Well, I must go. Talk to you all later. Maybe sooner.  Much Love
Alright. Wow! I'm up pretty daggum early! That's not necessarily a   good   thing, either... See, I'm one of those people who has to get their sleep. Beauty rest, if you will.  Anyways... Last night, I went to be around 2:30 or so..and then the phone rang at   6:30   this morning. Ughhh. And usually, after I'm awake, it's too hard for me to fall back asleep, so I'm stuck being the only one in my house that is awake. Well, Dad would be too, but he had to go do some work, and I don't know if Thomas is awake or not, considering he hasn't been here but maybe 3 or 4 days this summer, which would be completely fine with me, EXCEPT for the slight little problem that whenever I get in trouble for doing something, I have to blame it on the dog. Mom didn't seem to buy what I was saying when I told her that Jill bought a pair of Chuck Taylor's on eBay. Go figure... Yesterday was guite some day...First, me & Dweeb talked a while, actually, I think we talked all morning pretty much, although nothing was said. Isn't it funny how you can talk to someone for a few hours, and then you realize nothing has been said...   Well, then later that night, after a quick trip to Wal*Mart, I went & ate at the BV! Yum! Then, to the BlockBuster, to see if they have the Secret Window, but NO, they are ALL out...  So it's back to the house. Then I get mostly packed for Oklahoma...gonna be fun!! I get back on the comp, and start my talking with Dweeb again. Talked about nothing for a while. Then the weirdness/i-don't-know-what-else started...  I don't know. I mean, I'm not at liberty to tell you the happenings. I don't want to get anyone hurt, including myself. If you are a noteworthy person whom I think needs to know about last nights happenings, I will have my people call(or msg) your people.  I would tell you on here, but things could get intercepted & twisted, so it's better not to say on here. I'll tell you in person, seeing as how things are already twisted more than enough.  Well, I think that's about all I can say on here. I think I might possibly have one of the longest blogs. Maybe that will make up for the week that I won't be able to blog, because I'll be in Oklahoma.  Much Love
Alright..unlike some ppl who already have blogs,(I won't call names..you know who you are) I'm not gonna be stupid & lie on mine, because anyone can read this, and you'll just dig yourself into a hole..a dark, deep one.  Yeah..ok,..just wanted to get that out..anyways..back to ME!!  Well..so far, today has been pretty boring. No one is on MSN msgr. so I haven't talked to anyone today. Since last Sunday, I've been at my grandparents, so I haven't talked to anybody for almost a whole week..and that's not a good thing, because that means I haven't been able to let my feelings and thoughts out..I haven't had a chance to let out everything that's bothering me. Some things are good, some aren't so good.   And I'm having the worst time trying to make decisions.. The hardest deisions are the ones where you have to decide to listen to your friends, who have good intentions and want the best for you, or listen to your heart and soul, which can make you the happiest person, or give you heartbreak. Now, normally I'd just listen to my mind, but of course, when I need my mind, it decides to take a vacation, which I'm supposed to be doing, but I guess the drama never takes a break, so in the mean time, I'm stuck trying to figure out what's the right thing to do..and it's not all that easy. Some days, I'm convinced that I should just go for it, and then the next, I lose all confidence. So, maybe it's a good thing I've been gone, so that way I don't screw my life up too terribly much.  This Sunday, early in the morning, I'm leaving to go with my church's youth group on a mission trip to Oklahoma. That should be fun, considering I've never been to an Indian Reservation Camp before! We'll see. I'll have to get back with you on that one.  Well, I think I'm gonna give this a rest for a while. Much Love
Ahh.. *Relaxes*  Just thought I'd share some memories with you about my beloved Oklahoma... Sorry, but I won't go into detail about these things, b/c, as much as I detest inside jokes...you know, when you aren't included...these are really good...and most of the few ppl who actually read this know the inside of the joke...     So here goes:  Things I Have Learned from Oklahoma:  -Don't touch Aly's pillowcase...  (It's been forbidden by the law.) -Blair has a fascination with tugging _ _ _  (The name is blank for her own protection.) -Jake Brakes  (For Ann...She made it funny) -It takes  2  calls to housekeeping to get few necessities..  (It was  just  6 sets of towels, a blanket, and 2 coffee packets. -Sometimes it gets too heavy, and then you just have to let it hang..  (If only she knew we were laughing at her ride...) -You never know what you'll run in to at the Rodeo...  (I swear w
