The following was written October 1st, 2001, thee weeks after the 9/11 attacks.  I'd like you to read it and remember the anger most of fealt at that time. Perhaps we should continue to feel that anger.  Don't let the Giant fall back asleep!  Our Enemies!  Hello my friends.  You know it's not like me to keep silent about something like the events of September 11th.  Something like this happens, and usually I'm the first to open my big mouth.  However, this time, I've been left speechless.  I've not been able to comprehend the magnitude of what has happened.  So, out of respect for those who've died, I've kept silent, a mourning period so to speak.  But now my friends, my mourning period is over.  Now my friends, I must speak my mind.  What you are about to read, is not for the faint of heart.  It is not for those who believe we should forgive those who would sin against us.  It is not for those who think we need to solve this problem diplomatically.  So if you are one of those people, I do not advise you to read on.    Let me first start by commending the Firemen and Police officers who went into the World Trade Center prior to its collapse.  These men and women made an INFORMED decision to go in.  They were experienced and trained individuals who KNEW the possibility of this building coming down.  And yet, they went in anyway.  They went in, not for glory, but to help.  They did not hesitate, not even for a second.  That is bravery like I've never known.  To knowingly go into a building that is destined to fall, only to help people.  Words cannot express my respect, and gratitude for these people.  They lived and died with honor.  Honor, a word most people don't truly understand.  These people’s lives define honor.  I also want to mention the rescue workers professional and volunteer working even still.  These people are also some of the bravest people I've ever heard of.  They work on and on without the slightest glimmer of hope of finding someone alive in all that hell.  My salute and my thanks to all of you.    That being said, I want to move on to our enemy.  These worthless little bastards are going to pay.  They can't come into our country, learn from our teachers, enjoy our freedoms, and enjoy our way of life, in an effort to take it away.  These cowardly bastards think they can smack us in the mouth and run and hide?  We will search to the end of the earth and beyond if needed.  And when we do find them, I hope we cut their tiny, shriveled from the sun, impotent little testicles off, boil them in pig fat, then force them to eat them, while pouring jet fuel on their extremities and setting them on fire.  Letting them suffer and burn the way so many innocent Americans did.  Of course, we won't do that, because we are Americans, and we believe in Human Rights.  We believe that every human being, no matter how evil, how worthless, how insignificant, has rights.  Rights to be treated with decency.  I realize this is a concept Osama Bin Laden and his crew can't possibly understand.  How could they? Seeing the way they treat their women, the very women who gave them life.   They can't possibly understand what it means to live with Honor.  They can't possibly understand what it means to live with decency.  And before much longer, they won't be able to understand what it means to live, period.  Because we will kill them.  Unfortunately, it will be a quick death.  They won't suffer, as they deserve to.  Lucky for them.  My God how I'd like to find them myself, rip out their black, loveless hearts and watch them die.  Let them taste my rage.    Osama Bin Laden says that we are the infidels, that we are all that is evil.  These ignorant maniacs gave us a lesson on what is truly evil.  They defined evil with their cowardly attacks on innocent men, women and children.  They say they are righteous, that they have God's blessings.  I cannot imagine a God who would condone such an unforgivable act.  They have just picked a fight with the richest, most determined and most powerful nation on the planet.  I hope they realize the true rein of terror they just brought down on themselves.  They have just pissed off over 300 million people.  Once again showing their ignorance.  We will find them, and we will prevail.      Now that the bombing has started, and we are biting back, they are complaining that we are invading them.  We are killing innocent civilians. I believe around 300 or so innocent civilians have died so far in one missile malfunction.  Let me clarify a missile malfunction.  The missile went off course.  An electronic circuit failed, and the missile went off course.  It wasn’t steered into this village.  The controls weren’t hijacked by some radical American then steered into this village.  The missile just malfunctioned.  Now, these things happen in a war.  A war, dare I remind them, they started.  Not us.  We gave them every opportunity to meet our retaliatory demands.  Demands they brought about.  They say we attacked innocent civilians?  The defined what an attack on innocent civilians is on September 11th when they cold-heartedly murdered over 3000 people in an office building.  And what about the attacks on their own people that they’ve committed over the past several years.  I guarantee, in last year, they’ve killed 10 times the innocent civilians we have in that one misfire.  We are a live and let live society.  We never asked for this war.  We never wanted to bomb anyone.  But I will tell you what, you hit us in the mouth, you better be prepared to get hit back.  And to get hit back hard. That’s the price you pay for picking a fight with us.  Don’t think we’re going t
