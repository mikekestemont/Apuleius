OK, Laura......How long does it take you to pee?   GEEZ!  I have been waiting for you to call back for 20 minutes.
Monte, what the hell is this!  Just kidding.  I will post some of them as I get them.  Although from the look of it is gonna take me a long ass time!  Thanks for the challange.  It should help me pass the time over break.  By the way I am onlyhome for a week so we had better do something!    Chops do you have anything planned for break.  I just know I will be home for a couple of days and just wanna come back here.  I plan on seeing Sarah, Monte, and Jaime.  I am going to and see a couple of movies.  The Passion of Christ and Hildalgo for sure.  Not sure what else.  Gonna attempt to kick Jaimes ass at ps2.  Maybe go bowling.  Mostly just hang and chill!  That is what I really want to do.  Just hang out and chill.  I think I will do another piece of artwork while I am home.  Something to shut my brain off!  That's all I have for right now.  I am out!
This test does not measure your intelligence, your fluency with words, and certainly not your mathematic ability. It will, however, give you some gauge of your mental flexibility and creativity. In the years since we first developed the test, we have found few people who could solve more than half the problems on their first try. Many, however, reported getting answers long after the test had been set aside, particularly at unexpected moments when their minds were relaxed, and some reported solving all the problems over a period of several days. Take this as your personal challenge.  Instructions: Each question below contains all the initials of words that will make it correct. Find the missing words. For example: 16 O. in a P. means 16 ounces in a pound.  Note: this test does have a distinct USA flavor, that might be why you do not understand a given question.  1)   26 L. of the A._____________-41)  29 D. in F. in a L. Y. 2)  7 W. of the A.
