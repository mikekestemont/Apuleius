This evening, we distinguish between the short story and novel format. Amy has a good start to a story. I read my  urlLink The Lioness  and we discuss its problems,  urlLink   strengths. Sharon discusses Ian Watson’s  urlLink Mockymen  (2003), which she’s enjoying. We read a few passages from Henry Miller’s  urlLink Tropic of Capricorn . Then, I finish by reading a short selection of  urlLink Rust Hills’ book on short story . I feel like I do too much of the talking, though most of it is reading to the group. I’m flattered, honestly, they like my reading voice so, and will keep trying to please them.
urlLink       WHO WE ARE : We meet at Kherry’s house or ( alfresco ) at Skinner’s Butte Park every other Thursday evening (in Eugene, Oregon) and have since late 2003. Anyone can join (and once a member, always a member).    WHAT WE DO : We analyze short fiction, poetry, books, and recent movies: their strengths and weaknesses, what we like and don’t like about them. We also bring in our  own  writing to be commented on by members, and we experiment with writing exercises and assignments.   OUR PHILOSOPHY : All of us in America haved learned to write via “negative feedback” (akin to the piano student learning to play while&nbsp;her teacher stands above her, ruler-in-hand). Hence, most of us have trouble expressing ourselves creatively on page. It’s no wonder! And it’s terribly hard to get honest yet supportive feedback. &nbsp; Our approach is to modify these negative approaches from the past. We do this by discussing what we LIKE about a piece first; from there (after credibility has been set, and it takes careful work, sometimes, but there’s  always  something good about a writing sample), we talk about what we didn’t like or didn’t understand. We’re supportive of each other’s growth and believe our writing can be further perfected.    CURRENT MEMBERS ARE :  urlLink Kherry  -- Jade --  urlLink Nathan  --  urlLink Amy  -- Sherry -- &amp; Terri. (Others have visited.)    MORE INFORMATION : kherry1bear@yahoo.com
urlLink     People who enjoy the piano in general and my playing in particular have asked over the years that I explain my approach to playing.  One sweet woman and mother of a teen student asked, "What should I do so that 'Johnny' might play like you?"  I was taken back by the question and said something like: "Johnny will have a unique sound, don't worry -- because he's a unique person, and musician, and we  all  have a unique sound."  Weeks went by after this incident, and I thought about her compliment more deeply.  I realized what I said to her wasn't a real response to her question.  She was noticing something very true about piano playing.  In fact, many pianists sound a lot alike.  And she somehow knew in this world of specialization, Johnny's only hope was to develop his own sound.  She's delved into a more important question; the words she'd used didn't quite do her imagination justice.  She was attempting, I now see, to ask something like, "How can I help Johnny veer away from run-of-the-mill, 'standard' piano playing and find more of a unique, creative, 'expressive' sound, a sound I associate, at least at times, with you?"  If I could have answered her again, this is what I would say.  First, I'd ask her a few questions, a superb way of filtering through what might become a web of misunderstandings as our talk progressed.  I'd ask her what musicians she likes and what period of piano music, in particular.  I'd ask her if she hoped Johnny might make a living from music, either as a nightly piano grinder, or even, if he's lucky, as a recording artist.  I'd then ask her to sit and close her eyes.  Using quasi-regressional techniques, I'd ask her about her first memories regarding music.  What was the first song she remembered?  How did it move her?  When did she understand what "music" was (as opposed to noise), and how did that affect her?  Answering the same for her, I would mention a 78 LP-folk recording of 'Puff the Magic Dragon' as the first moment I realized I was listening to a "song": what I'd come to understand was a string of notes composed (I would have used "made up" then) solely for my enjoyment and that of others.  I was about five at the time.  I realized then, as I listened about Puff and how he lived by the Sea, that someone had "pretended" Puff to entertain me and had made up a melody to tell the story.  They had made up the notes or "tones" that comprised his story, and these were meant to sound pleasing, to be memorable.  I'd realized I was listening to a "song."  I knew, too, that its greatest power was that it made me  feel , and not just feel any old way: to feel sad for Puff; to feel his loneliness; to feel especially for Puff having to go away.  I understood the song's themes: friendship, saying goodbye, and growing up (though at five, only as a five-year-old does).  More importantly, though, I stepped back (the only way I can describe it) and saw that a song (and music in general) are very special ways to be told something, told a story, or be made to feel.  I, and I remember actually thinking this, knew that a song was no doubt the MOST POWERFUL way a person can convey feelings to another.  I was amazed.  I looked at the LP's dust jacked and circular insert, reading the information it offered.  It was like receiving a present from God.  Years past.  Like many middle-class kids, I began taking music lessons.  I started with the clarinet, age nine.  I was not very good.  I didn't care much for the its sound, and worse, blowing into it made my cheeks sore.  I rarely practiced.  I'd played around with an old hammond organ we had in our house through my childhood, so when we acquired a new piano, I
