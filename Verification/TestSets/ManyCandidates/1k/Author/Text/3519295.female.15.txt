Why can't two people ever be having the exact same emotion at the exact same time?  so all of you out there know that i like frankie, and that frankie sometimes likes me, but always at the most inconvenient moments. well, yesterday night he told me that, had things been different at the beginning of the semester, we would probably be together now. he said "if i hadn't screwed up months ago, i might not be alone." i told him that the window of dating opportunity isn't as small as he apparently thinks and that something can still work out. he simply replied "Whatever. I suppose so."  i was like holy crap, make up your mind. i just want to go out with him so something will have happened that will be the product of MONTHS of "will they, won't they"...it's terrible, but it's what i'm really thinking, so what? and besides, everyone knows that deep down everyone prefers "they will" instead of "they won't". i should share this piece of information with frankie and see what he thinks.   well, constantly on nate patrol. that boy is gorgeous and fine. add a comment if you agree! (cough, cough, meike, cough) tomorrow i leave for kansas city. i am all packed, and though i haven't left yet, i still have that horrible feeling that i've forgotten something that if vital and terribly important to the outcome of the trip.   i'm listening to a mised CD with songs such as:  edwin mccain: i'll be  relient k: sadie hawkins dance (gag for those of you who know what went down @ sadie hawkins...hehe)  someone: building a mystery  dashboard confessional: screaming infedelities  someone: rain (the song for the integris hospital commercial about the babies or woman with cancer...sheree chamberlin sang it @ BALTO assembly)  someone: California, here we come  someone else: title unknown   sorry to be so specific and sarcastic.   VERY, VERY SAD LYRICS:   It's hard to listen to a hard, hard heart  Beating close to mine.  Pounding up against the stone and steel;  Walls that i won't climb   Sometimes the hurt is so deep, deep, deep  that you think you're gonna drown.  Sometimes all i can do is weep, weep, wepp  with all this rain pouring down.   {chorus}  And it's strange how hard it rains now,  Miles and miles of big, black clouds.  But i'm holding on underneath this shrowd.  Rain.   It's hard to know when to give up the fight,  Some things you want will just never be right,  It's never rained like it has tonight before.  now i don't want to beg you, baby, with something you cannot give,  I'm not looking for the rest of your life, i just want another chance to live.   chorus   and it's strange how hard it rains now,  miles and miles of big black clouds,  but i'm still alive underneath this shrowd.  Rain.
I AM GOING TO KANSAS WITH MORGAN! i'm leaving tuesday morning and i'll be back next wednesday! i am so excited to be going, finally!  yesterday frankie called me, told me he missed talking to me, told me that he's never known anyone like me and i deserve to know how interesting and special i am.  i've gotten into the habit of, when i clean out the lint screen in the dryer, i've thrown the little messes of lint behind the dryer even though there is a mini-trashcan on the counter by the washer. there is about a two inch gap between the dryer and the wall, and i imagine i've almost covered the floor back there. but it's okay, no one will find it til i move out and five years later they finally sell the house.  my new favorite song: (Dashboard...of course... written by the fabulous mr. carrabba. it's not out on single yet, says the cashier at sam goody, but i need to save my money anyway for the trip. the plane ticket back is fifty bucks and i imagine i'll spend about $100 just...around...)  "Vindicated"  Hope dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption Winding in and winding out The shine of which has caught my eye  And roped me in So mesmerizing, so hypnotizing  I am captivated  [Chorus]  Vindicated I am selfish I am wrong I am right I swear I'm right I swear I knew it all along  And I am flawed  But I am cleaning up so well I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself   So clear Like the diamond in your ring Cut to mirror your intentions Oversized and overwhelmed The shine of which has caught my eye And rendered me so isoloated, so motivated I am certain now that  [Chorus]   So turn Up the corners of your lips Part them and feel my finger tips Trace the moment, fall forever Defense is paper thin Just one touch and I'd be in Too deep now to ever swim against the current So let me slip away  [3x] So let me slip against the current and let me slip away  [Chorus]  Slight hope It dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption...    the bold parts are my favorites. i'll sign on before i leave.
just a letter-slash-joke that i hope you all enjoy!  Dear Mom: Our scout master told us all write to our parents in case you saw the flood on TV and worried. We are OK. Only 1 of our tents and 2 sleeping bags got washed away. Luckily, none of us got drowned because we were all up on the mountain looking for Chad when it happened. Oh, yes, p
