As you can see, I didn't get around to posting anything yesterday. I was a zombie all day. Was up 'til 3:00 a.m. the night before and up at 8:00 a.m. It wasn't the lack of sleep that affected me. It was the staying up so late. I didn't do much all day. In fact, I haven't done much for the past couple weeks. It has been nice being lazy and not obligated or responsible to do anything but it's gotten old and today I'm bored. I did go out to Sam's Club and got a phone card and over to Walmart and got a nice big pot and stand for the new rubbertree I bought Thursday when Mom was in town. I have it replanted already but came up a little short on potting soil. It'll lst 'til tomorrow when I go out again. It's another one of those stupid people days here in St.Cloud. The way people drive and things they do just reeks if stupidity. That's not to be confused with ignorance. Ignorance doesn't know. Stupidity knows but don't think. I think I'm gonna pass my blog URL on to Louie so she can keep up on what's happening without writing me. I know she gets busy with her family etc. and doesn't have much time to write. Hard to imagine that in another 2 months, we will have been friends for 30 years. I don't think she knows, but back then, I gave her a special place in my heart and no one has ever been allowed there since. I still hold the fond memories there of when we were a couple and even today, I often think of her. I respect her more than anyone except Mom. Once, I let my emotions get out of hand and almost scared Louie off. It was stupid of me. I love her as the oldest and dearest friend I have. I wonder how long we'll stay in touch or if we'll drift apart someday. Who knows what's gonna happen after I get out of school next Winter or where I'll end up or what kind of job I'll have. It's scary! As morbid as it sounds, I figure I only have to do it a few years anyway. Reason being; my dad and his dad both died at 55 years old of sudden heart attacks. I'm guessing there's something hereditary there and with my smoking habit, I expect to follow tradition. More later (or tomorrow)
What a beautiful sunny morning. A little on the cool side. 49 degrees F. when I got up at 6:10 this morning. So far, I've read my morning email, vacuumed, dusted, cleaned a fishbowl, took a shower and took out the garbage. Exciting start for the day, hey? I do have to start getting to bed earlier at nights, though. I don't knnow why, but for the past week or so, I haven't been getting tired until 1:00 on the morning. Makes it hard to get up at 6am. I always say I'm a morning person but that doesn't mean I'm pleasent in the mornings. Just means I like to get up early in the mornings. Don't f**k with me until I've had a couple cups of coffee (Folgers) and a cigarette. The rental agent called yesterday morning and wanted to know if it was ok for her to bring the mortgage people up to my apartment this morning and let them see it. Apparently, this is an annual thing. They come and check out a couple apartments and take a picture or 2. I think it has something to do with assessing the depreciation or value of the building. I don't really know. I'm sure the rental agent selected my apartment because I always keep it so clean and have had many people compliment me on my decor. In fact, everyone compliments me on it. Several even say I missed my calling and should have been an interior decorator. I dunno. I can't see that as steady, good income. Besides, I can decorate my place so well because I know my "tastes" and what I like and don't like. I don't think it's possible to decorate for someone else unless you know them well. That's all for now. I may post again later today. Mom is coming down from her lake home for a visit and do some big-city errands and shopping. I expect her pretty soon, too. I love life!
Welcome to any and all who come to visit my very first blog. I'm totally new to this so it'll take me some time to figure it all out. I'm not much for reading instructions so I'll be learning by trial and error and example. Comments and suggestions are always welcome.
I'm home now after spending Monday and Tuesday night at Mom's lake home. I'm tired and my back is bothering me but I had a good time. Caught a few nice bass, did some chores for Mom (a few more than my back wanted me to)and camped out in my tent. It was nice going to sleep to the sound of the loons howling across the lake and waking to the songs of the Purple Martens. The neighbor next door learned that Purple Martens eat lotsa mosquitos so he has 2 big Purple Marten Hotels in his back yard. Bats are better at eating mostitos but I'm not gonna tell this guy. Talk amongst the neighboring people is a black bear has been seen in the area a couple times. Mom said she heard it Tueday night. We went looking for tracks but didn't see any. Daniel Boone woulda fired me as a tracker.    Tom and Becky and their kids are flying into the cities tomorrow and renting a car for the week to go up to Mom's. They shipped out some of their stuff via UPS.The best thing about doing this instead of driving out is they don't spend 4 of their vacation days traveling in a car. Makes sense. They'll follow m
