urlLink    My first broken bone! ...and this is a good one... I broke the lower bone on my thumb, broke it into pieces, a few pieces. I was on my brother’s 4-wheeler riding a wheelie. I had the bike strait up and down and my hand must have slipped a bit and I hit the throttle and the whole bike just flipped out from under me and both me and the bike got tossed into the air flipping end over end. The bike came down on me and the end of the handle bars slammed into my hand. It was like someone smacked my hand with a hammer. It didn't really hurt but looked bad. My hand had a huge indent and the thumb was hanging down sideways. I thought it was dislocated so I pulled on it and moved it around but my hand still looked kind of funky and started to swell up so I spent the next couple hours at the hospital, got x-rays and found out that the bone was shattered so I have to go to an orthopedic doctor tomorrow. Hopefully it won't require surgery...
urlLink    J ust came back from eating at the "Pho" ... a Vietnamese restaurant we usually go to once a week for soup and egg rolls (Mmmmmm.. egg rolls) Working late tonight so we went there for dinner tonight so that makes twice this week we've done the soup and rolls. Below Ed and Mike demonstrate the proper way to make love to an egg roll.
urlLink    oh damn, those egg rolls are so good, a precursor to a great bowl of soup.  As Daisy said "it gets bettter each time I eat it", but the egg rolls  is there really anything better?  I am almost as thin as Ed in this picture, a little more to go...
urlLink    Mike, Ed and I getting a little carried away using some of the wonderful features in Hello.&nbsp; urlLink
hahaahhahaha.  the best thing about working in high tech is being able to crank out code and drink a couple of beers.  No heavy machinery here.  The beer helps to relax and get things done.  Well we ran out of beers in the office, and Ed remembered he had a 30 rack in his car...Today was like 97 degrees out and the beers wree still warm when he took them in fromthe trunk of his car.   Now 28 are in the refrigerator and 2 are in our hands.  Ed just looked at me and said:  " You know the good thing about these beers?  They are getting colder.."  hahahahah
urlLink    W e had a  little  cook-out with  urlLink lots of food  at Mike & Meg’s this weekend.  Mike bought a new grill and loaded it up with hamburgers, hot dogs, sausages, steaks, six whole chickens!… After we finished eating more animals than you could find on a farm we started playing craps.  We usually play poker (Texas Hold’em) but this week Josh dusted off the craps table and brought it over to Mike’s.  No money was involved in this game, we just played for fun and I’ve never seen a game like it . . . We played for almost six hours and the dice only went around the table twice!  Just about every player had “thousands” of dollars in chips in front of them . . . if only we could have that luck with the real thing we would have all walked away rich!
urlLink    mmmmm.  Saturday night's BBQ...well we had a great night of eating, drinking and playin craps at my house on Saturday night.  I started cooking on the grill at like 1 o'clock in the afternoon, then went and did a swim and a bike workout...8 o'clock the food was ready, and I was already drunk, the food came off the grill and everyone ate.  Then Josh worked as the dealer and 9 of us played craps until 2:30 am.    I was still drunk the next morning when I woke up at 10, so I had to postpone my long workout unitl 2:00, rode 56.72 miles, and broke the current D/M record for mile ridden in a day.
Oh well, another week in the books...I didn't exercise as much as I wanted to this week, but I worked a lot more than I wanted to, which is always good.  I got another couple of pairs of flip flops at lunch today, I think I have a problem, but it is all good I guess.  I spent $7 for two pairs of patriotic flip flops, I will probally waer them inthe back yard all summer as I BBQ.  mmmm, I can not wait until diner tonight, I am going to cook hamburgers on the grill.
urlLink    F ollowing the advice of Mike I have stepped out of the constrained world of shoes and socks and stepped into the new liberated world of Flip-Flops. I've always been a summer sandal wearer, but the old Jesus kickers were always a bit heavy and being made out of leather didn't breathe well in the summer heat.  The top pair is an American Eagle 100% cotton flip flop and retails for $19.50.&nbsp;  &quot;This flip flop has a rubber bottom with heavy-duty traction and a corduroy footbed that's padded for comfort. The corduroy upper features a suede detail for extra style.&quot ;  The bottom pair are an Old Navy $3.50 4th of July flip flop. &quot;Patriotic right down to your toes? These flip-flops are for you! Left foot bed features stars and right foot bed features stripes and Old Navy logo. Raised logo decorates rubbery thong. Sole measures 1/2 inch thick, with textured bottom for traction.&quot;
