I find that my thoughts take me to many different places while I'm lying in bed for hours, looking at the lights that dance behind my eyelids, uncomfortable and overhot or cold by turns as I shift around within the soft sheets that feel like sandpaper...I can't vouch for the coherency of this post...its basically what I often do on paper...but I felt like feeling the keyboard under my fingers...so you get treated to my midnight...well one-o-clock...ramblings. Oh...and in case there was any doubt they started from the first word.  This is what I do when I can't sleep I just follow my thoughts...wherever they take me. And I find its a lot easier to get them out of my head, so I can ignore them and get some sleep, if I write them down. It makes for the need to regularly take a pile of papers out of my room to recycle...when I get around to it...when I decide my room has reached the point of clutter just past messy and into slovenly...whatever that's supposed to mean  well I can see that my meanderings seem to have even less of a point than usual...lucky anyone who's decided to try and read this...its why I called my website Random Musings...seeing as it was created...and developed and added to only during these non-coherent, tired, but completely unable to sleep episodes...Which, by the way, I reformatted and added a guestbook to right before beginning this diatribe...  The world, it seems to me has begun to move in two opposite directions...its really almost a paradox of sorts...it seems to be both shrinking, becoming small. Bridged by technology: planes, telephones, the internet, cars, trains...etc... And yet in other ways it seems to be becoming larger. More expansive...  And I don't know that I like either of them really...but it seems (rather ironically) that it is the expanding that seems to be making me feel more claustrophobic...as the world seems to shrink...it becomes easier (to my mind) to escape from the rut...to go elswhere...meet new people...Though it also makes it seem that there are fewer places to escape to and less chance of getting far...but in a way that's good because it gives you the security of knowing that your lifeline the network of relations, friends etc are still within reach...  But it also seems that it removes a means...a direction of escape...if even for a little while...from the responsibilities, the rigid societal structures that have been built up...that are imposed upon us and ingrained in us throughout our entire lives...Its like that song by Great Big Sea really:  Penelope Released January 2002 (written by Chris  Hynes) Penelope works in the market Down in the coconut trees She’s  saving up all her money To go to America across the sea  She once had  an uncle He lived in Detroit town They got all his post cards But his  body has never been found  To this day To this day  She got a job  as a domestic Workin' for the minimum wage All her friends back home in  Jamaica They say, ‘You really got it made in the shade’  But they don’t  see her sweat and grind And her bended on her knees She wishes she was  back in Jamaica Beneath the coconut trees  Penelope’s back in the  market She found what it was all about Oh no, she doesn’t regret  it She’s just glad that she got out  But others aren’t so  lucky They’re there till the day they die Trapped in steel and  concrete No beach No moon No sky    or a story my mom has  called...oh what is it called, working towards what you already have?  or  something similar...  its just that it seems that the world...my future...is just coming a bit too fast...I mean I know that I'm ahead of a lot of people...in that I know what I want to do...its just that...I don't know that I want to do it yet...if that makes any sense whatsoever  I mean, yes I want to go into geology, I want to learn about it...study it...and eventually take a career in relation to it...its just that there is so much else that I want to do...and I look at my parents...who are great people who also knew what they wanted to do...but because they fell in love, had a family, and have to take care of us are stuck in a sort of half-life in terms of employment...because not too much money can be made as an artist...so they work for the post office...for people they don't like, with horrible management, making enough to have us in the lower-middle income, range so we can live comfortably...eat well, live with more luxuries than a lot of people out there in the world...but they are stuck there...in these jobs they don't like, unable to do a lot of things I know they would like to do...  Not having done a  lot of things they wanted to do....  I know my dad wants to paint full time...I mean he'll come home from work and go down to his studio...which he always talks about expanding...maybe taking over the garage for his studio or the like...but with one thing or another it just doesn't happen...not enough time at one point, not enough money at another, or sometimes its just not enough energy....but I mean he'll come home and he'll paint...or sketch or sometimes he'll just sit in the old chair he claimed for his studia and just look at the painting he's working on for an hour...sometimes he'll start working on it after that, other times he'll go upstairs...  anyhow I guess what I'm trying to say...in a roundabout, verbose manner...is that I suppose I'm a little bit frightened of trapping myself without having seen something of the world...without having taken the chances offered to me to expand my knowledge...I don't know that I want to go into University and immediatly streamline my studies to geology...yet I do want to enter it now as well...its just that I want t
