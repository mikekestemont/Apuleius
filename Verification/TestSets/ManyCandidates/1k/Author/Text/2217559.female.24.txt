Okay, it's like 10:45PM, Jen's in the shower and I am waiting to go to some Halloween party. Guess we will see how fun it will be. I have had 5 heinekens and I am feeling all good at this point. Sometimes I think it is just easier to get out of things so i don't have to commit emotionally. I don't what the hell my problem is.  I just kind of freak when things get tough and feel the need to just run from it all.  I think Jason hit it on the nail today when he responded to my email about leaving on a cruiseship.  He said, "Why? Sounds to me like you are running from something."  And I thought to myself, maybe I am.  I ran from Houston to Nac-a-nowhere and then from there to Austin and now to Austin to somewhere out in the middle of the ocean.  Yet I do try and blame it on business- like the contacts i will meet or the moeny I will save to get Bella Rock and SLT off the ground.  Hmm. Who's reading this now? The thoughts roam through my mind like a television that won't turn off. Tomorrow night is Shane's party. We are supposed to go.
Whoopee! Okay, I got the blog/journal/diary idea from Jennifer after she created an AOL journal. So I did some research online and thought what an excellent tool to have for communication while I am aboard the cruise-ship.   Monday I have my final interview for the first lady position and hopefully I will land the job and move aboard Celebrity cruiselines within the next month or so. Yippee. So, I think this will be a great place for me to post my journals about things that are going on in my life, places I am traveling and people I am meeting.   Happy Halloween, by the way. I have no plans tonight or shall I say I have plans which consist of not really leaving the house. I just want to hang out with Jennifer and throw water balloons at little kids and maybe throw back some beers. Should be fun - sounds as entertaining as anything else. Lord knows sixth street is not where I want to be. I did that last year and that scene was too much for me. Not to mention hearing about the urban legend of the crazed HIV person stabbing people with syringes of blood on Halloween.  That story still gives me the creeps.   SL-T Productions is coming along quite well - for those of you who aren't familiar: This is a production company that I have started with two partners. We are throwing a large xmas party in December at an undisclosed location. We are super excited as we now have an advertising exec, promotions person, catering, sponsorship from local businesses - everything is coming together quite nicely! It will be difficult to leave as things pick up but I am hoping I can persuade people like my hottie friend Shelby to pick up the front lines and step up the plate. She has great people skills and can seriously work with anyone.  My exboyfriend Jason emailed me today. Weird one he is. Never know exactly why we stay in touch. It's not like we are friends. Guess it's just that history, past that we still share in soe weird distant way. Gosh, it's only 2:45PM!! Oh my goodness another hour or more before I can leave. How irritating. I still have this lame office job until I get the final word on the cruiseship (departure date, etc.).   Okay, I am closing this journal for today - more to come soon!! Smooches.
We arrived in Cabo this morning. Wow, what a beautiful port! I woke up this morning with the bright sun and blue water from my window. I also saw huge rock mountains as well. Do you remember that seen at the end of Goonies right before the big sailboat comes from outside the rocks?  That is what is looks like exactly in Cabo. Just gorgeous white sands, the bluest water you have ever seen and resort style hotels all over the beach. I went to a great restaurant called "The Fish House" and I had a chicken sandwich. hehehe. Seafood is an everyday thing and chicken is a rarity.  Anyway a huge pitcher of Sangria was $9.00 and we didn't even finish it. I did some shopping, rode in a rickshaw an came back to the ship. Pretty uneventful day.   My bosses (9 of them, all greek) played a huge prank on me yesterday. Vassilis, my main boss, called me into his office and told me that as tradition the newcomer had to clean the outside of his windows. So he had a towel and a bottle on windex on his desk. I was almost laughing because I was like, "Ok his office is about 5 feet from the water. Am I going to be hoisted down or what???" He was very serious about it and he told me to report to the staff captain at the bridge at 8 this morning. So all night I was wondering around the ship talking to all the head officers trying to figure who else had done this weird crap before as well.  Everyone was like, oh it's fine. Don't worry about. Only the people that Vassilis likes are invited to do it so you have to do it. THey made up this huge elaborate story about how I would have to sign a release form.  I was thinking, "Are these people f**king crazy??????"  I sent Jen an email immediately telling her all about it. Hahaha. Anyway, I reported to the bridge and all the officers stood there - me in my shorts and tshirt ready to be hoisted down the side of the ship. Vassilis tells me I need to wear my uniform when I do it. (Panty hose, jacket, skirt, blah blah). I turned aorund to go back to my cabin and change when everyone starts l
