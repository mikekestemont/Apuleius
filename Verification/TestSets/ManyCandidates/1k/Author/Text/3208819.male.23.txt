Welcome to your first lesson in GTK. In this lesson, we'll learn to make a simple program that displays the "Hello World" message.
Have you ever passed a member function to the Win32 API and wondered why the compiler kept bailing out on you? Well I did. D'oh! I really need to brush up on my C++ skills :(.  Apparently, non-static member functions have a secret  this  parameter which make them incompatible with the function signature required by Win32 callbacks.  This is set right by changing the function definition from  void FooBar  to  static FooBar .  Now I need a graceful way of resolving   error C2597: illegal reference to data member 'CNetDocDlg::alldevs' in a static member function

It appears  urlLink slashdot  has been DoSed. I have been getting a 503 error for about 5 minutes now.
On linux, run  modprobe ide-cd  as root to plug-n-play an external cd-rom drive.
Lifted off the net &gt;&gt;   Go to  /usr/share/apps/switchdesk  and you will find files like Xclients.gnome, Xclients.kde so make a file for your chosen window manager and make it excutable. As for the contents of the  file, keep it similar to other Xclients.xxx   And now edit the file:   /etc/X11/xdm/Xsession   and check out the section that calls window managers and add a entry for your chosen window manager. As you will see this file actually calls  /usr/share/apps/switchdesk/Xclients.xxx    And now go to the directory  /etc/X11/gdm/Session  and create a new file having name of your Window Manager and for the contents of this file. You will find files like GNOME, KDE in the directory so keep the contents of the new file similar to those files, and make it executable.   And now simply restart gdm with command:   #gdm-restart   Another good source is  urlLink http://www.networksynapse.net/gdm.html
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;  int main() { 	float uptime, idletime; 	char tmp; 	FILE *f = fopen ("/proc/uptime","r");  	if (!f) 	{ 		printf ("unable to open file"); 		return 1; 	} 	 	fscanf (f,"%f %f",&uptime,&idletime);  	printf ("ratio of idle time to cpu time = %f",  		idletime/uptime); 	fclose (f); 	return 0; }
Xfce is a really cool Desktop environment for Linux. Its really light on resources compared to Gnome and Kde, and just as pretty.   Installation I tried doing an rpm install. I guess a tool like  apt  would've made it a lot easier. After downloading 23 rpms, I realized that I was missing a few files. They turned out to be headers with the  .hdr  extention. I found these files in the header directory, but had *no* idea what to do with them.  But then I had also started a parallel download of the source files. And instead of going through help forums, I opted to do a source compile. This is my compiling order:   libxfce4util  libxfcegui4  libxfce4mcs  xfce-mcs-manager  dbh   xfce4-panel  gtk-xfce-engine  xfce4-systray  xfdesktop   xfce-mcs-plugins  xfce4-themes  xfce4-iconbox  xfce4-mixer   xfce4-toys  xfce4-trigger-launcher  xffm  xffm-icons   xfprint  xfwm4  xfwm4-themes    Note  ldconfig:   To add the path  /usr/local/lib  to ldconfig, append it to  /etc/ld.co.conf  and then run ldconfig.
I read parts from Douglas Adams' books fairly regularly even though I have read most of his books several times over. I frequently come across stuff that I somehow did not pay adequate attention to. Today, I came across this:  Everybody has their moment of great opportunity in life. If you happen to miss the one you care about, then everything else in life becomes eerily easy.  - Douglas Adams (Mostly Harmless)  I think I missed this one because it had an SEP field around it ;-)
Guess you must have heard about Chetan Bhagat's book 'Five Point Someone'. The book is the story of IIT from the insider's perspective. Chetan is IIT Delhi and IIM A passout. The book was launched in Bangalore over the weekend. Do check out  urlLink a review .   Disclaimer: I don't have any vested interest in the book and I haven't read it myself. However, I have heard rave reviews from friends, so thought of recommending it to you guys, before I go and pick up a copy for myself.
So, I have finally managed to let go of my lethargy and shift bag and baggage to Blogger. I am testing if the team-blog thingie works properly and then I'll invite all the guys listed on the previous site to join the team.
