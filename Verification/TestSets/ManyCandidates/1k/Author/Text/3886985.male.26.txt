So I just took both finals for my first Summer Session courses today. PoliSci 10 went well, and I felt pretty confident about almost all of the exam; PoliSci 12 was a little worse - I felt good about the essay, but not so good about 2 of the 5 IDs.  So I did what any good student does; take your best guess, and try to make a little humor, hoping the TA will laugh when grading and give me a few more points. :D  So how long of a break do I get until the second Summer Session classes start? Oh. I get the weekend off. Yay me.  Crap... I need a break.
Hello everyone!      I am posting this as a warning to all of you, who may be thinking of purchasing something from the Internet at any time. This is not spam, and is entirely from my own experience. The details in this story are facts, and happened to me over this last week. Please feel free to pass this on to anyone you'd like; this is meant to serve as a warning, and hopefully to prevent you from having horrible customer service, like I have.      Over the last week, I've been browsing the Internet for a certain pair of speakers, Harmon Kardon Soundsticks (USB version). These have been discontinued by HK, but are still available online. I did some searching, and saw that not only did Buy.com list them at the lowest online price ($165), but included free shipping. Because Buy.com's warehouse is located only a few hours north of me, it should take only a day of in-route shipping to get here.      Before ordering, I sent them an e-mail on Wednesday to try and find out if they were new-in-box or refurbished speakers. After not getting a response by Friday, I figured I'd bite the bullet and take a chance; after all, I wanted the speakers either way.      I placed my order at 10:30am PST (1:30pm EST) on Friday; Buy.com's web site states that in-stock items usually ship same day if ordered by 4:30pm EST (1:30pm PST) - I obviously met this requirement. I checked their website around 4pm PST, to see if it had shipped. It was listed as being "Sent to Warehouse". As you guys know, companies sometimes take a while to update their websites and with the weekend, I wasn't overly concerned.      Monday rolls around, and I still haven't gotten a shipping confirmation e-mail, and their website still listed my order as "Sent to Warehouse". I sent Buy.com an e-mail through their website asking for a status update. (Side note: Still no reply to the first e-mail I sent on Wed.) I went to school and didn't get a chance to think about it further until the afternoon. Around 3pm, there was still no update via e-mail or website. I attempted to find a phone number on their website to call, but there was none - at all. I thought this was odd, and tried a Google search for their contact information, which turned up nothing. I decided to do a WHOIS search on their domain, and got a phone number through that. But, it was past 5pm now, and I waited to call until Tuesday.      Tuesday morning, still no new information on my order. I called the number, and got over to an order representative. She informed me that the speakers I wanted were on "surprise backorder", and had been for over two weeks. (Surprise backorder? Was there suddenly a rush on discontinued 2 year-old USB-based speakers?) They had no ETA as to when they might come in stock. But wait, doesn't their website list them as in-stock? They sure do - and the lady had no idea why. Why was I not informed of their stock status before, during or after placing my order? She had no idea, and apologized. I was upset at this point, mostly for wasting nearly 4 days waiting for speakers they didn't have, but decided to see what other Internet retailers had the speakers, and simply take my business elsewhere.      5 minutes later, I checked eCost.com, and found they had them for only $169.99; not too much more, and they also had free shipping. I called the phone number CLEARLY shown on the top of their web site, and confirmed they were in stock. I placed my order, and less than 15 minutes later, was very happy again. I decided to call Buy.com and cancel my order. Upon getting a hold of a customer service rep, she kindly took my request to cancel the order.      Fast forward to 3:30pm PST. My order from eCost.com has already shipped, and should be here tomorrow (Wednesday). Then I get an e-mail from Buy.com. It seems that "Unfortunately, this item has already entered the fulfillment process and we were unable to cancel it." Wait - how has it entered fulfillment? They can't ship or bill me, because they don't have the product. And they have no ETA on getting the product; so how can they not cancel the order? (Keep in mind, they have an authorization charge on my credit card for the speakers; their policy, however, is not to complete the charge until the item ships.) I call them once again, and the customer service rep informs me that she cannot just cancel the order; they have to e-mail a "request to cancel" to another department. Wait, what? How does that make sense? You take the order, you can cancel the order. Who does business like this? At this point, I'm getting upset and ask to speak to a supervisor.      A supervisor finally gets on the line and insists that he can't do anything. I grill him about their policies and how they operate for nearly 30 minutes, but he still only apologizes and says he can't do anything other than e-mail this other department. When I asked about this department, he confirmed they were in the same building - but he couldn't call them OR physically go there to t
