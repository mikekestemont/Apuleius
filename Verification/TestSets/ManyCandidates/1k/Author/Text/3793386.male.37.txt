Excellent (as usual) post by  urlLink Radley Balko  on  urlLink this article  concerning praise heaped upon some youths for advocating a "War on Alcohol."  A comment by yours truly is also at the link.  I depart from Radley somewhat, but only in terms of focus: All government policies (indeed, all human decisions) should be subjected to cost-benefit analysis.  Radley decimates the youths' defintion of "cost" while I prefer to emphasize the neglect of the aggregate "benefits" of alcohol.

urlLink Dean to debate Nader.   It will be interesting to see if Kerry is even discussed at this event...or will it be just more  urlLink "Beat Bush" folderol .  Sidebar: Clearly Dean has been promised a cabinet position in a Kerry administration in exchange for his support.  I wonder which (hopefully we'll never find out!).

Story in today's Wall Street Journal (subscription site -- sorry), describing new local laws holding supermarkets, Wal-Marts, etc., responsible for shopping carts stolen by customers, juvenile delinquents, the homeless, etc., and then abandoned.  Some towns are imposing fines, while others are passing laws requiring prevention methods, such as beepers, wheel locks, etc.  Seems to me that if I go to the local Home Depot, steal a shopping cart, use it in a way not sanctioned by Home Depot, then dispose of it in a way also not sanctioned by Home Depot, then the problem is with me, not with Home Depot.  I'm the one committing crimes and torts.  Why go after the merchant?  Simple: because they can.   urlLink Reductio  scenario: Someplace will start imposing a tax on hardware stores that sell spray paint to fund anti-grafitti programs.  (In some jurisdictions it is already illegal to sell spray paint to minors.)

urlLink Another Very Merry Kerryism :    "Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry says if he's elected president, 1 million more students will graduate from college during his first five years in office and he will bring a special focus to boosting opportunities for low-income and minority students.  "Kerry's campaign says  nearly half the hike in graduation rates will come from population increases ..."   Let's see -- elementary and secondary public education is a disaster in this country,  urlLink especially in my own city  -- yet our higher education system is the envy of the world.  So of course which one does Kerry want to futz around with?  Maybe  urlLink Hillary's approach  is better.

urlLink This proposal  gives me pause.  How long do you think it would be before such a system would be abused?  Neighbor's dog barking too loud? Report them as spammers.  Your competitor taking market share from you? Hire a hacker to frame them as spammers.  I don't know what the solution is -- but it's not that.

...or is that trip, stumble, collapse?  Couldn't avoid it any longer ... I just have too much to say and don't want to fill up (and thereby annoy) some of the sites I post to, especially my favorite, TheAgitator.com.  Main topics of this post will be libertarian / classical liberal issues, the decline and fall of New York City under Mayor Mike Blooperberg, the decline and fall of Standard Written English, blackjack strategy, my dog Diamond, beer, and anything else that lowers my blood pressure to gripe about (a la Mike Straka's "Grrr" column on FNC's website.  And with that, welcome...

Consider  urlLink this reader post  at Overlawayered.com:    In the case of smoking, I am one of those who thinks someone smoking around me (in public, of course - they can do as they like as long as the smoke stays on their own property) is a form of assault.  Analogy - chlorine gas. A little more obvious, a little quicker, and therefore easier to condemn, but whatever crime someone who releases chlorine gas in a public place (or directly onto my property) is committing, a person who blows their smoke on me in a similar manner is committing.  The post then proceeds to destroy the asinine analogy.  My concern, however, is how flippantly and carelessly the reader tosses around the word "public" -- exactly which "public" area would that be?  I doubt there is anywhere left in America where every   truly   "public place" (i.e., government office building, courthouse, airport, military base, etc.) has not become either totally smoke-free or at least has designated smoking areas. The issue, of course, is the casual willingness to impose constraints on   private   places, especially bars, hotels and restaurants.  (And please don't bother with the whole "don't you know that  urlLink 'pub' is short for 'public house' ?" Grow up.)  You're concerned about your right to breathe smoke-free air? STAY HOME! Or go to my competitor's bar down the street (or, better yet,   my   bar down the street) that has responded to market forces and has gone smoke-free.  The "right to breathe smoke-free air" in a bar or restaurant is as fictional as the right to drink free beer or eat free food or veto the band's music.  As I have  urlLink previously  plagiarized:  urlLink Without property rights, no other rights are possible .

urlLink Bush :  Reforming Social Security by allowing younger workers to privately invest a portion of their payroll taxes through individual accounts will be an important part of his second-term domestic agenda, President Bush told supporters this week.   urlLink Kerry :  As president, John Kerry will not raise Social Security taxes, raise the retirement age, cut benefits for people that rely on Social Security, or privatize Social Security.   He will consider making sure that high-income beneficiaries don't get more out than they pay in.    Did you notice that last part? Not only is he perfectly willing to let Social security go bankrupt -- he is even willing to guarantee that Social Security taxes never actually function like an   investment  .  In his nomination acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention, Kerry reiterated that he would not privatize Social Security.  As always, your single best resource for Social Security information is  urlLink Cato .
