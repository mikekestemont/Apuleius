Prepare to lose cabin pressure.....    Welcome to Hell!  I'll be your tour guide in this delectable paradise, where the current temperature is a steamy zero degrees.  That's right folks, Hell has officially frozen over.  Now if you'll just follow me this way you can see our new flying pigs exhibit - oh, and don't mind the big red guy.  Satan decided to help out and start giving everyone sleighrides.....   That's right my loyal readers, life as you know it has ceased to exist.  Allow me to explain: Let me mention the name Karen - now I understand you've never heard this name before.  She is my most recent ex-girlfriend - the only one I ever lived with.  The short version, is that she went crazy - I mean  really  crazy.  She would scream at me and criticize me and make outrageous claims about me.  So I moved out, and for about my last week there, we didn't really talk.  We didn't say goodbye.  I didn't even care if I talked to her again - ever.  For anyone that knows me, this is a big deal.  Then last night on instant messager the tables turned.....   K:  Are you there?  Me:  I could be  K:  You hate me?  Me:  Hate is a strong word.  K:  Well, it's taken me a while to realize how stupid this has all been.   I'm sorry.   Houston, we have just lost cabin pressure. I mean what do you say to that, to someone who you feel has treated you like shit, who you previously described using words like heinous, incorrigible, and malicious?  I acted cordially, but it was disturbing, because she was actually being nice.  I don't know what to think - I only know this:  it's not over yet.
Time to rant..... Why is everyone so pissed off?  I have done nothing wrong.  MK - If you want to treat me horribly, insult me to my face, and not even apologize or admit that you've done anything wrong, what right could you POSSIBLY have that would make me have to treat you with respect in return?  This is the part I don't understand.  If you want to be my friend, act like one first - otherwise, I have no reason to really want to be your friend anyway.....  Rachel - Don't even get me started.  You have no right to resent me - we are not together because of your choice as much as because of mine at this point, so don't turn on me just because you're not happy about it.  Your jealousy is not my fault, your unhappiness is not my fault.  Enough negative.  I have had an outstanding weekend, and it is mostly due to one person.  Agreed, the parking lot of Jay's Diner is hardly the most romantic of places, but there is never a perfect time, or a perfect place, and never at the right time.  Emily is someone that I can truly talk to and truly open up.  I love looking into her eyes and seeing everything that she wants to say in them - and I hear every word she doesn't say.  She is beautiful, both on the inside, and whether she'll believe me or not, on the outside - and it's genuine.  But the dilemma still persists and it feels much like Dagny's accidental crash into Atlantis:  knowing everything that I do, am I ready to make such a committment?  And this isn't just your typical male-anti-committment-syndrome, there would be serious complications.  Aside from being in 2 different locations geographically, she'll be in Maine for 10 weeks of the summer, and I don't know that I'll be able to get there to visit.  What do I do?  I'm so torn.....  Why does it always happen like this?  She's amazing, and she brings out such good things in me, why is she so far away?  Why is it so hard?  "And maybe knowing isn't the answer." ~Chuck Palahniuk
John Galt said that he was going to stop the motor of the world - I can't imagine the amount of strength something of that magnitude would require.  At the same time I feel like I have that much strength within me - that no matter what happens I will always see the truth, that I will be able to remain uncorrupted by the ignoble and the malicious, the valueless and the virtueless.  Is it up to me to change the world?  And not just 'change the world' but actually  change  it?  Is the extremity of Atlas Shrugged or of Sodom and Gomorrah exactly what this world needs to survive?  Is there really no hope left for the majority of the world?  Why in a world that is what we make of it are there so many who are not happy?  I will not pity you - it is your own fault, not mine; I refuse to accept the blame - I refuse to grant you pity.  If you choose to accept pain and fear and guilt in your life, then this is your choice - I will not accept it in mine.  This is why I smile - not because I do not understand what is going on, but because I do fully.  Emily makes me happy - I refuse to feel guilty for that.  When we talk there is always a smile on my face, and I refuse to supress it; I refuse to accept the comments of my so-called friends; I refuse to feel guilt in addition to my happiness.  Rachel does not make me happy - I also refuse to feel guilty for that.  It is not my responsibily to make her happy, it is her own, and I will no longer cater to that - I refuse.  If this is what makes me a bad person in her eyes, then so be it - I am better in my own and it is my life and no one else's.
