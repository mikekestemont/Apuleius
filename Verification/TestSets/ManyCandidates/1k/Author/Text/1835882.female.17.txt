YaY! i went to the races last nite w/ dad and it was awesome! skip did ok. he had a new car that was running fast but not fast enough to  beat colin northway....but thats ok he still did really good in my opinion....then dad and went down to the pits and i saw skip and looked at his car again LoL! and then bought another shirt this time for M.B. and had skip sign it and yeah that was about all we did down in the pits and then i asked my dad if we could party w/ the people but he said no. before we even went into the grandstand dad let me get stickers that you put on your car and i got two of them...a sprintcar and then one thats says "Im that girl your dad warned you about" they had a whole bunch of really cute sayings there was this one that i wanted to get that said "my dad's faster than your dad" just reall cute little things like that.  in the 410's Colin Nothway won and in the 360's Billy Alley won. they are both really super fast racers and only beginners too! last nite was the last nite of sprintcar racing and knoxville for the season now i have to wait til april.....grrr! skip will be going over to austrailia to race like he normally does...or well he should be going over but i havent heard....i was going to ask him if i could have one of his  urlLink tearoffs  and he sign it for me but i never did b/c that would odd....i think tearoffs are cool! hehehe....yeah i know im strange but they neat! ok well ima gonna go and eat something.

ok so i got out of school early cuz of heat  again . when i got home mom was home thats unusual well she wasnt feeling well so then she said i had to go and meet kiel half way and i was like for what?!?! well see my dad went golfing w/ steve and he took our new truck and parked it at steves well i guess he locked the truck w/ the keys still inside it and running. so i had to go out to the pioneer blacktop and meet kiel w/ the spare keys! jeez......
ok well i've got it how i want it! i just got done washing my car by hand! now i feel really sick. anyways school got out early cuz of heat and i had my job interview today at pizza hut it went fine...the guy was really nice. ok well i dont have really anything to say except i cant wait for saturday!
hello. im quite new to blogs but i think i can figure this out on my own in like 2 hours! i hope anyways once i've figured this out and i've got it to my perfection i'll probably delete this wonderful post and post a "professional" one tomorrow or something!
oh what a day.....im super sleepy and yeah it was hard to stay awake today in school. i just got home awhile ago from my grandma and grandpa's cuz my dad was out in the field. and i have so much energy i find everything funny and even though i was really tired today in school i found certain things amusing and people would say something and it would be a joke and it'd take awhile like usual but then i'd get it and it'd be even more funnier....yeah ok well lata
Last nite was the game and we lost but we did good i think. i actually saw like a whole play where cj almond got a touchdown that was pretty cool and then i also saw another touchdown but i cant remeber who got that one but yeah i was so excited that i was yelling and screaming and wow it was awesome. then i saw and heard the impact when a midget and one of our players...cant remember who but they collided and i saw it and heard it and yeah they was hovering over both of them for a long time then our player got up and that a good thing but the other player was put on one of those board things and put in the ambulance. after we performed the national anthem for pre-game fireworks went off and that was really cool too i turned around to look even though we werent spose too then when we made the tunnel and football players ran through they had really cool like pyros that went off on either side of them as they ran through...it was so cool! oh and when we got a touchdown everytime the also had fireworks go off. itwas just way cool i though....whoo-hoo!   me and sarah went to the dance just b/c and partly b/c of something else but anyways we went it w
