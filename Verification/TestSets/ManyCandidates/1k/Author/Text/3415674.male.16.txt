Such a rush/ believe your deceit Concrete/ only when you sleep More than/ all I ever need Too much/ seems to make me bleed Forfeit/ all I used to know For shit/ I'll only have to show Believe/ that all will be alright But decieve/ I won't be home tonight  Show me how to fight this So I won't live a lie Give me some incentive so at least I can try
When your arms cry in crimson tears They’re telling you don’t succumb to your fears I’m telling you don’t succumb to your fears I’ll keep you safe, I’ll keep you alive I’ll burden your pain upon myself So yout soul may rise Fears retract, soar to the skies And I like pie  [Why haven't I fixed this yet?]
Thrown off the spaceship to your universe Mabye I'll make it next time Feels as though I have a disease Thinking I can do the impossible in my mind Cause I know you're there And I think you're waiting For me to call This love isn't fading Will I sink, or will I surface To your island This makes me nervous I think I've found the words to tell you how I feel  I think of you so much, even in my sleep Sometimes it lifts me up and keeps me on my feet I'll make a move this time Something I should have done years ago So can we be together? Let us glow and grow Will I sink, or will I surface To your island You make me nervous I think I've found the words to make my dreams real
When your love is so Contagious... I think I should up and go Cause all roses have their thorns. And you'll just drag me down below I know your something more But your not something for me And you never say What you see in me  SO JUST... LEAVE So I may fight this on my own SO JUST... LEAVE So I can have a chance to grow SO JUST... LEAVE ME HERE  It felt so good today Free and on my own So much that my outlook changed Even my voice had a higher tone Love is something that I will stay out of For as long as I possibly can Cause love is the weakness I can't stand
There's more to this somewhere but this is all I remember by heart, I'll finish it when I find the paper I wrote it on.  Everything is grey The world is out of place  I turn to her and She turns away her face I’d like to think were on the mend But I know its just pretend I can’t fix a broken heart The glass was shattered from the start Now everything I see Is covered in kerosene I’ll watch the match fall Cause soon I wont care at all.
[I wrote most of this a few months ago on the bus to school and to home, I just put in a quick chorus and finished parts of the second and first stanzas, this isn't about anyone in particular, its a story of a girl who gets too caught up in trends and whats popular, spoken from the point of view of someone who was a good friend that they left behind for something "better"]  To me you were godsent To others you were trash A firelfy caught in the rain  No one thought you would last Light and wings dampened (by our culture) But I’ll heal them anew Cause you’re the only one I trusted Something I’ve now learned to never do Because your eyes gleam so bright alone As you turn your ears to the radio Everywhere distance is growing Inch by inch it kills us all But I’d rather jump of the cliff now For I have created another cause of the fall.  Societies Girl Beautiful but phoney Always sweet talks Cause she’ll die if she gets lonely If she would open her eyes and look around She’d realize That the spotlight wasn’t plugged in at all  Now that you’ve moved up so high Is it hard to look down to where you came? Cause you know the clouds aren’t thick enough To forget who your friends are in this game I believe that you could come back to your senses And take off those worn out headphones Because the music is so repetitious And everyone is calling you to come back home
You worship the ground you can't walk on even though the grass is greener where you stand I'll show you a place you never knew and I will forever be your man  Its taking time but surely its close to the time when we will break our molds ticking clocks make us all but sane dropping down to crack cocaine  always seen in the stars gaze  the love we gave untill the grave cant explain anything anymore
Seize the day look away from your pessimistic circles now freeform, painting colours non-existent to the monotone scale appreciate a summers day because life is filled with uncertainty and death will always be calling but do your best to make him leave a message while you listen to the music in the living room.
Hidden behind white walls with no exits. Nothing is heard outside of this box. I've sealed myself away again. Where everything I do is lost.  A light illuminates, the direction unknown. Somewhere outside someone is calling. Light appears at a new window. Suddenly my voice changes its tone.  Walls start to shatter as I call the name. It calls back in a tone that kept the gods sane The walls dissapear and nothing else matters I see the one standing there...
It burns in my lungs Out to my tounge What has to be let out This dream is done  Don’t know how it fell apart this way Or how it came to this  It felt like I was just playing a part today And love was only in the scripts  I’d like to believe That you would stay w
