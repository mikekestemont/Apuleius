Sigh, what do I expect? after going through so much troubles in the school. Felt lost and never able to return back to the past again... Why? Everything seems to be predicted by me in the past.. I did said before, we'll never be together and now we did it.. That hurts alot... Really.. I really hope that we're like in the past and happily facing each and everyday in the school with laughter and fun... Now, everything is impossible.. Time can never turn back to last year... Lost time is never found again...
Hello? 23rd of May, 15 years ago, a little was born which is me.. hAha.. it's just another passing and living in agony.. What the.. Choiceless family and no freedom...
Sigh.. I hate my damn sis, she really sucks. Okie, I'm trying not to be biased against her, just that I simply cant stand her way of herself! She thinks that she's right all the time and she thinks that she smart everytime. She thinks that people will see the "perfectness" in her just because she read afew books about upgrading self-attitude. Alright, it seems to help her in her attitutes at times and did change her for a better person. However, books are not forever right or wrong! Books are not updated frequently and I hate her snatching the computer with me saying that I didnt allow her to use the computer and I was on purpose?! She didnt even tell me or ask me that she wanna use the computer, how do you expect I to know? So unfair to me and I felt so unhappy under her control of doing things that I dont like at NIGHT! She has hands and limbs, I'm sure she can do it too, right? Staring right behind my back as if she's watching the television and rudely turning low the volume of my speaker and order me to close the mp3 player? My god, I really dont like this kinda stuff, better get the hell outta here or else I will get a tight slap from her, bye  Sigh off, bLue`iCe
Hmmm, just as the blog suggested, " Lost Time Is Never Found Again" . Friends are just like that, once friendship is broken between 2 of them, lost time ish never found again... It reflects right on friendships and relationships, I'm not particularly biased against my friends or what. I'm trying to show down here they theory of my quote, I felt very sorrowful ever since the split last year 2003. It has left a deep impact on my friends and my life greatly. Haa, it sounded just like boy-girl relationships, it does leave impact, aint it? Those precious times we spent together were not gonno come back again as enjoyment, instead, it's memories that we have left behind.. Time cannot reverse and put everything back to pieces again especially those precious moments that are important to us. Maybe you felt that this is totally crap but deep in my heart, I'm in dilemma to decide what to do and when to do. This has bothered me every now and then cause I'm not a very open up person, it seems like an easy job for you to make alot of friends in reality. However, to me, it' a tough job to get to know more people as I'm unrealistic...
