hello all.  foodle wants me to make a disclaimer before I put this onto his blog, so I shall now:  this is me stoned at roughly 2:00AM to 3:40AM.  I got home, blogged like a fiend, and then went to bed to sleep off my influenciosity.  You can see evidence of this post having been on my blog  urlLink here .  anyways, here is random blog of stoned-ness.   gotta finish this post before this stuff wears off  I regret to inform you, that I am currently stoned. Silly Kevin and Foo, you should have known better than to send me off with Paddy! and his ohh-so-West Coast, pot-smoking ways... (take that, Mr. Lt. David of the I don't know where British Columbia is kind Chin!) second time in two days. I'm a pathetic human being with no will power, and a desire to get away from my horrid expectations of myself. *But is weed the answer children? survey says: yes.* I take no responsibility for this post, I thought it was funny when I wrote it. I want all who read this blog to be happy and laughing while they read my blog so that they like, it and keep coming back for more. (wow that sentence got forgotten, and it took me like a full minute to retrieve it from the depths of my brain; it's kind of liking losing luggage to the airports (Nazis), and then having to wait a year or more, and give up on it, and then get it mailed to you, after you've bought your men's shaving cream, and Braun face razor, and new pairs of jocky shorts, which is the same amount of annoyance on the annoyance scale.) (wow, that mosquito was enormous! made it easy to swat, though. Their getting ginormous in Canada! (*putting on astonished rancher-girl voice*) quick Cletis, get the gun, the parasitic aliens have already taken the mosquitos, and are ready to start their transfer to the human race through the cardio vascular system!) (that was a muscle, not a system) (yikes, that entire previous paragraph was read in my mind in a horrified Aunt-May-from-Spiderman-but thirty-five years earlier, offended voice) All this stuff is nothing but excerpts from all the thoughts I'm making, except for the editorial, boring ones (you know like that's missing a pee, that's supposed to have a cue, this is a better word. you don't need to knw about that.) However, obviously I am babbling, and as such a babbler, I am physically obligated (by my sever lack of control, or judgment systems as made inebriated by the substance I have been smoking) to tell anyone anything about me...like Paddy asked if I was good at blow jobs (though in not so many words), and I was like fuck you (i don't think I said that, but I was sober enough then (a little) to be able to kind of mutter it away). but that's a rare case, usually, I'm like, I blab all. stupid pot. Every few seconds, I just keep going off on tangents then losing my thought train (plenty good room on the glory train, there's a ...) and it's frusterating. hmmm. deep breaths. the ghost who doesn't like Sherayna is giving me such a disapproving glare. She's from a really old period of time that view divorce as a stain against the soul, and as such does not like Sherayna, and now I suppose she doesn't like me because I'm gross and pot-ty (ha I said potty) I wonder if the neighbors next door can tap into my computer screen using secret government hack softwear for spying? that would suck, cause they might be able to pull up my recieved files folder or something and--ooh--know what I've been talking about. tricksy hobbits. you think ghosts or spirits can move the physical elemental molocules around in a way similar the god-like capacity to create to create something like a birth of a monster? what if he hated pot smokers, and burned 'em all up with his super-mollecular powers cause he was a ghost and could? he'd be so antisocial! (that cracked me up!) I hope you all laugh when you read this. cause maybe if you're laughing and having fun you won't be so condemning of me having the same fun you are having. That = no getting hurt. I miss my Capricorn bracelet. wait, that was a necklace. w/e. he hates me, I suppose I hate him now. Although I would hate to have to hate the memories. There'r some good ones. I wonder how embarrassed I'm going to betomorroow? cause this is pretty uncensored, basically all that's going into my head is poo-fing right out of my mouth and onto paper. (but I'm not talking! ooh! talented!) does that make me honest or does that make me cheap? you tell me. cause then I won't have to be the one who has to intuit what every one has said for everyone else. I'm making some major psychological breakthroughs here in my head, but everytime I formulate my plan to put it down on paper, it eludes me! Like for instance: what was I just thinking about? something about me--NO! me getting psychologically less--dependent? no. guilty? no...what was that? nope, can't remember by rereading the text. if I were speaking I would probably be slurring. The problem is I keep making thoughts to fast for fingers to write, then I lose them cause I'm onto another thought, and my hangs are screaming "mayday, mayday, we have to make sure all this info is getting out to all your readers out there in blogland! they need to know! (Brianna-like wail) They need to KNOOOOOWWWW!" their the captains of the ship, and they're going dooooooo oooooooooooooooo oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ooooooooown... I hope you appreciate the effort, cause my BACK is achin! *limps off to Electric Lettuce* what's that? electric lettuce you say? why there? because that's where I should go cause I SMOKE POT! AND IT'S A FRIENDLY ENVIROMENT! I love stoners. It's like a j
