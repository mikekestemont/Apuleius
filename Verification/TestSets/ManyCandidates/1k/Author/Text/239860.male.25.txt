Wohaa!   It's the finals in  urlLink Big Brother  tonight. Yay! Gonna be fun. Fun to get rid of the show (it was gettin' kinda "used" at the end there) and fun to see if Lars Joachim wins the hole shebang!  Other than that nothin' much have happend here at the Crib. Just a few minor fixies. Got rid of the .php diary and whacked in this  urlLink Blogger-powered-thingy-flinghy . And that my fellas, was the touch of heaven I needed to get my groove on again. (got kinda sick of this thing when it didn't work ya know :p )  Anyways, my inlaws are commin' to visit on Saturday and staying for a week. Gonna be kinda fun to have visitors in our fine flat. Ya know, I was thinkin' on this a few days ago and I came to the conclusion that the only thing missing now is the dog *lol*.  But enough babbling from me....gotta go work some more ya know. I'll be seeing ya.....  PS: remember to give yer daily hails to the king...baby (yup, that king would be me :o) So go do it dammit!
Oki, first blog from me, just to see how it works, no biggie and no for the  bold  test and the  kursive  test and finally the  urlLink link  test

Dammit denT!   So, what's new in my world these days? Not much actualy. I'm going on vacation as of tomorrow. Me and my Girl's gonna take a plane back to where I'm from on Saturday. Gonna spend the whole week there (and that means my whole vacation). I'm looking forward to seeing them all again, strangely enough :)  Maybe I'll update some while I'm there, I don't know. Time will show as they say...   I'm considering doing a major change around here. Dunno what and how, but I'm trying to come up with a good idea for when I get my domain. I'm leaning for something in the line of a bloggingcrew site, maybe a place for me and my friends to say our shit. Dunno yet, first and foremost I'll get me that darn domain :)  Oh yeah, I want ye all to go to  urlLink eufori's site . She seems so down lately, maybe we all can cheer her up if we join forces? So get movin', that's an order :) And I'm gonna be the first to congratulate  urlLink miss Nattfall  with her cabelconnection! Congratz baby! We'll never get rid of ye know will we?... *lol*  Yes! I just found my painkillers, whooptidoo! *tossing down a couple*  That'll be all for now, so if y'll exuse moi while I bend over and lick my balls ;)
Well, wadday know!   My all-time-fav writer has gotten "digital". Neil Gaiman is currently using  urlLink Blogger.com  and is writing daily updates at  urlLink http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/journal.asp !! I'm hereby setting my self a new goal, I'm going to put all my resurces in getting a hold of Neil Gaiman's e-mail adress :) Not for any aparant reason, I'm just in desperat need of something to chase *lol* I need a challenge!  On the other flip, I'm boooooooored! I'm now over and above the point where I can be bored, and keep my sanity, all at the same time! I'm singing and doing weird shit right now. I'm glad there's no-one else is at work right now :)  But now I gotta pack up, going home for the day. I'll be seing y'all
Yessiree!!   I'm now a happy man! Ødegård, one of my oldest and best friends, dropped by tonight. He's in the army (navy to be precise) and he had some shoreleave before he was going out again tomorrow. Anyways, the good news is that he's on leave at the time I'm having my wedding! So that means he can be my best-man! I was hoping for it, but it was a chance he didn't have leave at that time. But he did, and I'm glad he had. Cuz I've known him for about 7 or 8 years and he's one of my closest friends.  But enough chat for now, gotta go to bed now....I'll tell y' more 'bout it later :)
N'dang it...   oh well, this is just one of those days i guess....i got nothing to say, but a heep of time to kill. so that's why i'm using lotsah space on writing about how little i got to say to the world :p i even figured i'd check out this fashion i've noticed lately -- yup, you got it right -- writing perfect english in all small letters :) (or at least as perfect as i can make it). dunno why it's so "in" but hey, i'm open for it...  did  some browsing today (as always) and came up with some cool/weird/stupid links i thought i'd share with you   Where do you wanna blow today?  #  urlLink §1  #  urlLink §2  #  urlLink §3  [tnx  urlLink frykitty ] #  urlLink §4  # ...and last but not least, the coolest animecartoon on the web! --  urlLink http://www.exploitationnow.com/  -- you just gotta love it :)  hmm, looks like my short post about how little i have to say suddenly became the long post about how little i  thought  i had to say, but realized otherwise :) but hey, i'm not complaining...  btw, maybe i'm gonna regret saying this, but saturdays party was a blast! i loved it! oh...and while i'm at it. mom/dad, i'm still waiting for an respons to me and  urlLink digiboys  phoneprank! *lol*
