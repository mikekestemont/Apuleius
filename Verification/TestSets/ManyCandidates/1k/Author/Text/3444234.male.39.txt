Let's have a go at Photo Blogging using  Hello .   urlLink    Me at my wedding ceremony&nbsp; urlLink     Hmm not bad.
Time to try blogging I guess. I remember my friend Mario showing me Mosiac in the early 90's at work (I've worked at IBM since 1986)and wondering if this World Wide Web thing would take off. We'd been using email and instant messaging on the mainframe through the 80's but the world at large hadn't experienced it yet. And now it's come to this. I could never have predicted blogging technology back then.  Well I got married at easter, see  urlLink Jo and Alan's Wedding  for some pictures. It worked out really well, I had proposed to Jo back in January. We met at  urlLink Strathvea  in 1996; a group of us have been going there for Easter every year since the early 90's. We thought it would be right to get married there, but of course many friends and family wouldn't be there, so we're holding the reception in July to celebrate with all those people. Best of both worlds really. The wedding was great, couldn't have been a more perfect day for us really - and we did catch everyone by surprise, which was the main aim!
I'm spending my days at the moment working from home. Since Jo is now working full time that means she heads off every morning at 7:30 and I spend the day doing the grocery shopping, or laundry, etc. I really miss the days when she was working part time and we could go out for lunch or coffee during the daytime. Of course I do actually work when I'm at home; it's just a nicer environment to be able to sit on the verandah with the wireless laptop to do my email, or watch TV as I edit course notes. Right now I'm watching the Czech Republic whoop the asses of Denmark in the replay of the last Euro 2004 quarter final. Poor Danes - I am one quarter Danish so I would have liked them to win, but the Czechs look just too good. Two weeks until our wedding reception, really looking forward to it. And the week off afterwards as well of course!
Just watched England win (shakily) against Switzerland in their group match. Soccer is the only sport I'll support the poms in, and it's a nightmare supporting them! They managed to lose 2 - 1 to France the other day after leading at the 90 minute mark. Now France are playing Croatia .. I had a few hours sleep but I have been up since 11:30 pm. For some reason I find watching the games live so much more exciting, it seems worth it to miss the sleep. Guess I need to get in training for the baby anyway. Bun is coming up on 14 weeks, and we have 4 weeks until our reception, which will be an interesting event. More surprises for the attendees! Hehe. My plan is to announce the baby to the world as part of my speech at the wedding reception. Should see a few jaws drop then I think. This weekend we head to Sydney for the night on Saturday to see Australia - Scotland rugby test, and the following weekend we have tickets for Australia - England rugby at Suncorp Stadium. Lots of sport at the moment!
Second last day in Bangkok - the food is good, having fun so far. They've cleaned up the streets a lot since I was last here! Traffic is still ridiculous, but manageable. Jo had the nuchal scan of  Bun  on Tuesday, I was presenting to a class but waiting nervously for an SMS on my mobile phone. Anyway, it was good news .. easiest thing is to give her report:   Whew!  I was a little worked up of course and then they called to tell me they were running about an hour behind schedule.  When I got there, I still had to wait another 20 minutes.  There were three other ladies waiting each  with their husband so I felt very lonely hehe.  Then another woman walked in and I thought "beaut, I'm not the only abandoned one here" .. but then she called her hubby and said he had 15 minutes to get there.  Oh well, you'll  just have to be there for the next visit!  The good news is, I have a video tape of the ultrasound .. which is just as well because the three printouts I have are really hard to work out.   Although it will still be difficult to understand what you're looking at on the video without the operator saying here's this or that.  And the really cool thing was being able to look at Bun in 3D!!  Bun was lying in a perfect position for the nuchal translucency scan so Theresa got that measurement first.  Then she went scooting around looking at Bun's heart (fluttering away very obviously), stomach and bladder (I took her word for those two!).  She also showed me Bun's legs and arms so he/she got full marks for having everything where it should be!  Bun's arms were covering the face for a lot of the time (shy already) but near the end he/she had a wriggle around and it looked way cool.  Apparently Bun is lying anterior (towards the front) so we won't feel any movements for quite some time - probably not til around 20 weeks whereas a posterior baby can be felt from about 17 weeks.  I'll read up on this though.  Anyway, then I went off and emptied my bladder (ahh) and Theresa prepared the results.  She called me into an office soon after and straight away said they were excellent results.  She sat me down with a flowchart of options.   Just walking in without any tests, my chances of having a Down's Syndrome baby were 1 in 139.  That's based primarily on my age.  Then the baby's age, my blood test results and the nuchal scan get taken into account and I had a n
