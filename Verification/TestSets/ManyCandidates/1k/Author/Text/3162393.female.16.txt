yup! yup! i was alone and i did it! i had my schedule in my speech power classes today.. remember?! MIRACULOUSLY, i went home, ALONE! harharhar.... i'll tell you the whole story below.. hehehehe... diba, in my previous post, i told you that i HATE being ALONE... i feel helpless..lonely, i dunno why?! but today, i just did it... why am i so proud?! malay ko... let me tell you about my day..  First, i woke up at around 10 in the morning, an hour earlier than my usual bangon.. then i did nothing... i just watched the tv.. then ate, until nag 12:45 na and i took a bath na.. i told laurice that we're going to speech power at around 1:45 na lang because dati, we were quite early... but, laurice asked me to accompany her to Chrisjekar to buy a ballpen and a little notebook, and so, nagstart na kming mag biyahe at about 2:10.. Fortunately, we were not late again, i saw Ellen (one of my Chinita classmates) and we chatted a bit.. then, our class starts.. we had recitations and discussions for today, but we also had an activity, you have to choose a partner... it was a sort of informing, persuading and giving comments... me and laurice were not partners.. a girl, who i met in the first day chose me.. she is Simonette(a girl from UST), the newspaper i picked has a picture of a cellphone, so yun, i think we did it well naman.. we got a 10, a perfect score. well, actually, all of us got a 10(because my classmates are too generous or i think they're just afraid to speak out?!).. the instructor told us that we should only lessen the giggles and laughter... hehehe.. me pa, i always laugh! all the time! i can't help it! we will have our so-called "Reporting" next meeting, with a VTR!! i dunno what to do! we're imitating wazzup! wazzup! and me, Laurice and Sandra are assigned to the entertainment news! i wonder what am i be wearing?!?! so yun, after the class, we went to Robinsons Manila with our new friends..Sandra, who was beautiful and smart, and Nabel who was cute and friendly. The two ate at Sbarro's, but Laurice told me that she don't have enough money that's why, we ate at Popeye's and met her cousins...we left Robinsons without Laurice, Thank God i was hinatid in the fx terminal by my new found friends, even though i'm quite nervous, i have to commute by myself! and im proud to say... I DID IT! nga pala, while in the fx, my bestfriend txted me that he will drop by my place dahil kukunin nya daw yung feeding bottle ni shake(his pamangkin), and some of his vcd's that he l
