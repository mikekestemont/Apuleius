WWE RAW Report - August 16, 2004       Live via satellite from  London, Ontario     Hosted by: Jim Ross and Jerry "The King" Lawler        Well, tonight really is the  Dawning of a New Era ...you see, while 24 year old Randy Orton won his first of what will be many World titles last night from The Crippler at  SummerSlam , tonight with this very episode of Monday Night  Raw , I make my return to weekly internet wrestling writing or whatever you want to call it. Basically this is a forum for my thoughts and opinions on everything WWE and even  urlLink TNA . Or whatever I feel like at any time. So if you start to seeing movie reviews and random thoughts, don't be surprised. Right now though, I'm going to focus solely on  RAW  and  Smackdown  and all things WWE. So with that, let's get to it.  SummerSlam  was last night in T-Ont and was off the chiz-arts as John Cena might say...      God, the  urlLink Olympics  are fucking gay. It would've been cooler if Kurt Angle had gone ahead and trained to go this time around. Angle vs. Rulon Gardner...just wasn't meant to be.       They Refuse to See the Change in Me Why Won't They Wake Up?  - I love that theme, dude.       Randy Orton - the new World Champion gets announced to the ring by Lillian Garcia to start the show. No doubt about it, he looks great with that strap over his shoulder. Balloons, confetti - the whole spiel for Randy. Randy was on the cover of the Toronto Sun this morning. That's very cool mainstream coverage for the WWE, who were all over the place in Canada over the weekend promoting the show. The Sun is part of Canoe, while produces a site I  used  to work for  urlLink Slam! Wrestling . Anyway - one helluva long, important feeling entrance for Orton. JR and King build up his "address to the masses" big time. Randy begins by explaining how he proved all his doubters wrong by sustaining all of Benoits offense to become the youngest champion in Federation history. He then has all of the fellow 24 year old males stand up and then take a good look at what an average 24 year old looks like - not even in the same league as Orton(whose probably been fed some sort of steriod since birth by his Daddy). The camera men cut to some of the fugliest 24 year olds in the audience, which sucks because they're subtlely making fun of their core demographic. Orton proclaims that he not only better looking but just plain better. He says his win over Benoit was not a fluke - it was Destiny. A helluva recap video plays displaying in great detail all of Randy's accomplishments leading up to his match last night. It put Randy over very well for any newer fans out there who might not be too sure about Orton. After Randy goes on a while about how great he is he proclaims the start of the Randy Orton era which gets interupted - thankfully I think - to a nice pop by Chris Benoit. Benoit lets him in his best Stu Hart voice that his first title defense is against him. Orton wants to hold off a couple of weeks, but Benoit says he just got the OK from Bischoff and he's using his rematch clause TONIGHT!  JR proclaims tonight will be Destiny - the overuse of the word is killing me. We go to commercial and I go to the refrigerator for another beer.        Smackdown  is coming to my neighbor Spokane next month. I will of course be there front and center to harass my dear wrestling friends.        MATCH 1 = Rhyno vs. Sylvan Griener     So the gimmick here is if Rhyno loses he and Tajiri never get a shot at the Tag titles again, and if Rhyno wins he and the Jap get a shot at  Unforgiven  on September 12 - the day after - in Portland, Oregon. Grenier takes the early advantage while Rob Conway DDT's Yoshihiro on the outside. JR likes the potential of the ECW alum. Potential what? Those two should be main eventing against the Benoits and Guerreros in a perfect world of great storytelling. Sylvain continues working on Rhyno in the ring while Conway - with his MAN beard fully grown in Frenching him up to the max - screams sweet nothings on the outside. Sylvain holds the Man Beast in a head/neck lock for an almost Orton-like length of TV time to my dismay. Rhyno powers out and hits a nice powerslam. Nice catch as catch can ensues with Rhyno hitting a good looking belly to belly. Conway inserts himself in the match which gets Rhyno's attention long enough for Sylvain to get a suplex and nearfall. Tajiri jumps on the apron then and hits Sly with his green MIST and Rhyno hits a GORE GORE GORE -  Vote Kerry  - for the win and the title shot. I hope they give them the titles finally. The match good for what it was, and that was another in a stream of segments putting over the tandem of ECDub guys.       Back to Ross and Lawler who talk up the soap opera that is the Lita, Kane and Matt Hardy story. Lawler throws it to his broadcast partner Kane who announces his wedding to Lita will be next week at the Arrowhead Pond in Anaheim on RAW. Lawler laments about seeing Kane kiss his new bride and I ponder the return of Shawn Michaels to the very arena he won his first WWF title at so many moons ago to get revenge on the Big Red Machine. Oh it will happen, HBK will ruin the wedding and save Lita - I can almost guarantee it. JR announces Kane's first wedding present and it's an IC title shot against Edge and it's BY GAWD next!      Vid-cap recap of the Hardy-Kane match from Slam and the finish with the ringbell and K
