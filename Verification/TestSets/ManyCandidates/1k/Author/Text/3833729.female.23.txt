I sit here, just looking at him. Cars, buildings, busy people passing by.  He seems preoccupied. I wonder, is he thinking about us? I smile as I stare at the one thing that changed my life. My thoughts drift to the day I told him what I felt. Tears.. I remembered. And a lot of love. I smile again...First gear... Second... third... Eyes on the road. Not even a trace of happiness on his face. I wonder. Religion? Money? Sex? Is love ever enough? Whatever happened to us?  Sigh.  What's  your problem?  Smile. I'm alright. First time I fall this deep. First time I'm messing up. First time I love anyone more than myself. First time I hurt someone so bad. Like a duckling in a vast lake. I feel lost. This love... so unfathomable. This love... so new. Consumes me like fire.  Twenty-three years I waited. I'm not about to give it up. The ups and downs. The laughter and the tears. There's an inner sense of happiness. Ride on... 100.. 120 on a winding road. Makes my stomach sick. or not? Hold on. Seat belts tight. Makes me want to scream sometimes. Good? Bad? Definitely nice. Hang on... crazy feeling I can't have enough of. Like a bad medicine you get addicted to.  I turn to him. I'M SORRY. Hugs. Kisses. Don't ever do it again.  And I love you so.  Yes, he loves me. Every day... feels good just knowing that.
And Sundays are for weeping, and early Monday mornings. This house is uneasy. Unlike my recliner in the office. Sleep through the day... easy. Step out of the fridge... and I find you. My comfort. My shield. My life. Oh you're on the phone. I'm sorry. Warm iced-tea in a white-tiled dining/locker room. Toothpaste-on-a-toothbrush in my mouth afterwards. Breath meant for kissing. Good morning!  What's for lunch? Let's eat Chinese. Nooodle time. Yawn. Yawn. Yawn. I love you. And you love me too. Perfect day. A movie. In my house... quick shower. Put on fresh clothes. Back in our home... with a recliner in the fridge. Regular days... I am living. I am alive.  Now I woke up... and my pillow is wet.  Sundays are for weeping, and early Monday mornings.
First quadrant. Friends chatting. Sex rings and stuff. Mya got irked. She was hurt. I’m an asshole. Always have been. Old and wasted, and definitely an asshole. That’s what they think. That’s what she thinks. I say to myself… hey it’s ok, every family’s got one nowadays. They all laugh. They all enjoyed the joke. What joke? I was serious in a way. Mya got irked. She was hurt. And I’m still an asshole.   Too much confidence can kill a man. I believe that everything I do is always right, so it’s always ok. And it only follows that everything I say is just. Why do I think that way? I smile and I say to myself “you’re an asshole!” and it feels good. Do I shun myself from other people to let them know that I’m a tough guy so they won’t mess with me? Probably. Yeah, that surely explains it. A bully. I walk through life knowing that I am king, and I own you. No questions. I own you.  Pause. A long one. Thinking. It felt bad didn’t it? Why do I feel bad? Mya got irked. She was hurt. And I’m an asshole.   Mya still loves me.
creaks in the wind   time passes whether you want it to or not.  i decided to take a back seat and let the scenery run by.  like watching things happen to somebody else who just happens to look like me.  no pain no happiness no fear no pride. took a vacation from myself headed nowhere. nowhere.  ended up in regret somehow.  tried to get back in the game but got swept in and couldn't find my feet.  i took a long time of stumbling around; taking too many looks behind; falling to my knees.  getting back on the horse isn't the tough part, i believe its staying in the flow so you don't fall off.
I stare at my half-empty glass of golden bliss that sends chills down my throat, while this stupid guy on the boob-tube pretends he’s the president of the USA and declares war over Vietnam. Wanted to call someone, realized I don’t have a phone. Wanted to buy one, realized I’m short by a buck.  Buck-naked man drinking beer. A knock. Someone at the front door. Stairs leading down. Door swung open. Hi bro, wher’ve ya been? Back to the stupid guy/president.  Outside… must go out some more. No, not some more. Must go out. Always in-front of the boob-tube. Climb more trees, play more games… hide and seek. Ride my bike, fly a kite. Hey bro, let’s go swimming. Hey mom, hey dad, take me to a movie?! Grandma, grandpa… are we gonna go on vacation? My computer broke… that’s it for the games.  And then I turned 27 again.
I bumped into a friend the other day. Haven’t met him for about a year.  Small talk about past trippings. Rock concerts and alcohol shots. Made me feel old. When my mom and dad would lecture me six years ago I would readily tell them to leave me alone ‘coz I’m old enough to know what I’m doing… how I wish now that I am not old enough to know any better. Mya would definitely disagree. I was told that I feel old because I always think I am old… I think I am old because I’m surrounded by young people who think they are already old enough. I don’t really dig old people. They are always serious about life. Why is everybody in a hurry? Life is spinning around me so fast I could scarcely keep up. Does anybody ever really stop to ask what would he or she be ten years from now? Answer: older. Smarter or richer or poorer are just a product of time. The only thing that is definite w
