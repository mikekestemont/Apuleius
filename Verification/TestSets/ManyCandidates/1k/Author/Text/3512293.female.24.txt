its funny how im feeling right now, when i was getting really excited about my baptism a week ago but yet im having neutral feelings about it as if it's not a big deal though it really means a lot to me.   (2 Corinthians 5:17.)    "Because I am 'in Christ,' I am a new creation. Old things have passed away. All things have become new."  Christ came to open the prison doors and set the captives free. The prison is open! Whom the Son sets free is free indeed.    this is something i've been waiting for...the moment when i'll be dead to my sins & starting life anew, both literally & physically after the baptism. at times i wonder if im able to do a good job in shining for God cuz it's definately not easy being a Christian & living a life that's more than being just a mediocre Christian...everything we say & do really counts & it's so easy to ruin the image of God by making a wrong move. but thank God for the strength & grace that He'll provide for his children who seek His help.  lately, i've been praying about the loan thingy & i realised that the anger doesn't really exist anymore even though i dwell on it at times. i saw him online & i just told him no matter what happens, he's still a friend of mine & i'll never forget the times he stood by me in the past. he probably has his reasons for avoiding me or something & i shouldn't be so quick to condemn this friendship or him..on the contrary, i ought to feel happy that i was able to help him when he's really in need of help & this is probably a lesson for me in learning to be generous & not focus too much on the material possessions of this earth. i thank God for showing me this & for helping me to be wiser in my finances...i still want to be of some help financially to friends in need (not that im very loaded of cos) but this time i have to see if it's really for a good cause & need before i do it, otherwise even if i can't get the $ back, at least i know what i've really done with the $ so it's given out without regrets.  many times we learnt the hard lessons only after we commit the mistakes which are irreversible...i keep thinking about them lately & i told myself to fully let the past go when i get baptised tomorrow. stuff about my past r/s & how i lived my life back then before knowing Christ, esp the times when i was backsliding...if it weren't for Shawna who never gave up in asking me back to Christ, i think i'll still be living a meaningless life, repeating the same mistakes which will only lead to a dead end. Cheryl said this:  "It truly is a step further into the supernatural, into a realm of greater anointing... and God will use you in mighty ways, in ways you can't even imagine.  You'll be empowered to walk this earth and this life with assurance, with authority, with confidence, and with a kind of faith that overcomes the world!  So congrats again - your life will never be the same."  This is really an encouragement for me & i know that wanting to get baptised is the wisest decision that i made in this lifetime...i want to live a different life for sure & this time it can't be just all talk & no actions taken...but i know i'll rely greatly on God for his support to be just like Jesus...overcoming whatever persecutions that come my way, etc...  tomorrow will be the most exciting day of my life & i know that LIFE WILL NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN!!   Psalm 9:1-2   O Lord, I will praise you with all my heart and tell everyone about the marvelous things you do. I will be glad, yes, filled with joy because of you. I will sing your praises, O Lord God above all gods.
today is a day where i'll feel deep regrets for not cherishing my dad when he's still alive...for not being able to reach out to him back then when i was already a Christian...for not being able to do him proud...& most of all, not being able to show him how much i love & appreciate everything that he's done for me in my life. but today when i went to pay respects to him, i just told him that i'll do him proud & take good care of my family...i really wish that i can get to know how he's doing somehow but i don't know how God will answer this question of mine.  i had a wonderful time fellowshipping with Wen after going for a water baptism class in the noon. im very excited abt my baptism this sun because i wanna be dead to my sins & really start life anew. i don't wish to be tied to my old self anymore & i just wanna re-dedicate my life to God, not committing my former sins & suffer the condemnation of my sister. it's pathetic being condemn by someone who's really close to you just because of something that you did which isn't even related to her. People are just so quick to judge, criticise & condemn but who cares about what others want to say as long as your conscience is clear & most importantly,  we have redemption through Jesus' blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the richness of His grace .  (Ep 1:7)   Praise God!
