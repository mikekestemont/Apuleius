GEORGE W. BUSH  1600 Pennsylvania Ave&nbsp; NW  Washington DC 20520  &nbsp;  EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE   Law Enforcement:  I was arrested in Kennebunkport, Maine, in 1976 for driving under the influence of alcohol. I pled guilty, paid a fine, and had my driver's license suspended for 30 days.   My Texas driving record has been "lost" and is not available.   Military:  I joined the Texas Air National Guard and went AWOL. I refused to take a drug test or answer any questions about my drug use.  By joining the Texas Air National Guard, I was able to avoid combat duty in Vietnam.  My military records have been "lost" and are not available.   College:  I graduated from Yale University with a low C average.  I was a cheerleader. &nbsp; PAST WORK EXPERIENCE  I ran for U.S. Congress and lost.  I began my career in the oil business in Midland, Texas in 1975. I bought an oil company, but couldn't find any oil in Texas. The company went bankrupt shortly after I sold all my stock.  I bought the Texas Rangers baseball team in a sweetheart deal that took land using taxpayer money.  With the help of my father and our friends in the oil industry (including Enron CEO Ken Lay), I was elected governor of Texas.   ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS GOVERNOR OF TEXAS  I changed Texas pollution laws to favor power and oil companies, making Texas the most polluted state in the Union.&nbsp;  During my tenure, Houston replaced Los Angeles as the most smog-ridden city in America.  I cut taxes and bankrupted the Texas treasury to the tune of billions in borrowed money.  I set the record for the most executions by any governor in American history.  With the help of my brother, the governor of Florida, and my father's appointments to the Supreme Court, I became President after losing by over 500,000 votes.   ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS PRESIDENT:  I am the first President in U.S. history to enter office with a criminal record.  I invaded and occupied two countries at a continuing cost of *over one billion dollars per week*.  I spent the U.S. surplus and effectively bankrupted the U.S. Treasury.  Under my administration the record was shattered for the largest annual deficit in U.S. history.  Under my administration an&nbsp;economic record was set for most private bankruptcies filed in any 12-month period.&nbsp;  Under my administration the all-time record was set for most foreclosures in a 12-month period.  Under my watch&nbsp;the all-time record was set for the biggest drop in the history of the U.S. stock market.  In my first year in office, over 2 million Americans lost their jobs and that trend continues every month.  The&nbsp;members of my cabinet are the richest of any administration in U.S. history. My "poorest" millionaire, Condoleeza Rice, has a Chevron oil tanker named after her.  I set the record for most campaign fund-raising trips.  I am the all-time U.S. and world record-holder for receiving the most corporate campaign donations.  One of my best friends, Kenneth Lay, presided over the largest corporate bankruptcy fraud in U.S. history, Enron.  My political party used Enron private jets and corporate attorneys to assure my success with the U.S. Supreme Court during my election decision.  I have protected my friends at Enron and Halliburton against investigation or prosecution. More time and money was spent investigating the Monica Lewinsky affair than has been spent investigating one of the biggest corporate failures in history.  I presided over the biggest energy crisis in U.S. history and refused to intervene when corruption involving the oil industry was revealed.  I presided over the highest gasoline prices in U.S. history.  I changed U.S. policy to allow convicted criminals to be awarded government contracts.  I appointed more convicted criminals to my administration than any President in U.S. history.  I created the Ministry of Homeland Security, the largest bureaucracy in the history of the United States government.  I've broken more international treaties than any President in U.S. history.  I am the first President in U.S. history to have the United Nations remove the U.S. from the Human Rights Commission.  I withdrew the U.S. from the World Court of Law.  I refused to allow inspectors access to U.S. "prisoners of war" detainees and thereby have refused to abide by the Geneva Convention.  I am the first President in history to refuse United Nations election inspectors (during the 2002 U.S. election).  I set the record for fewest numbers of press conferences of any President since the advent of television.  I set the all-time record for most days on vacation in any one-year period.  After taking off the entire month of August 2001, I presided over the worst security failure in U.S. history.  Despite worldwide&nbsp;sympathy for the U.S. after the World Trade Center attacks, less than a year later I had made the U.S. the most hated country in the world, with the largest failure of diplomacy in world history.  I have set the all-time record for most people worldwide to simultaneously protest me in public venues (15 million people), shattering the record for protests against any person in the history of mankind.  I am the first President in U.S. history to order an unprovoked, pre-emptive attack and the military occupation of a sovereign nation. I did so against the will of the United Nations, the majority of U.S. citizens, and the world community.  I have cut health care benefits for war veterans and support a cut in duty benefits for active duty troops and their families -- in wartime.  In my State of the Union Address, I lied about our reasons for attacking Iraq and then blamed the lies on our British friends.  I am the first President in history to have a majority of Europeans (71%) view my presidency as the biggest threat to world peace and security.  I am supporting development of a nuclear "Tactical Bunker Buster," a WMD.  I have so far failed to fulfill my pledge to bring Osama Bin Laden to justice.  During the Iraq War and Occupation thousands of American troops&nbsp;have been&nbsp;injured and killed. I
