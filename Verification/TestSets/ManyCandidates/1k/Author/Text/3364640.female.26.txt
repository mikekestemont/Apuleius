So today the girls and I thought it would be fun to go out for a late lunch/early dinner and talk all sorts of shit about our psychotic meth-head paranoid and delusional room mate.  Or should I say soon to be EX-ROOMMATE!!!    We were just talking a whole lot of shit about him and kind of didn't stop when we got home.  I mean, we were using code names and stuff so it couldn't have been all that obvious like, or could it? muwahahahaha!  So he announced that he was moving and this was his 30 days notice.  We were all so excited and happy we instantly ran to our rooms and posted on craigslist and myspace and wherever else we could that we were looking for a new roomie!  Can I tell you how happy I am?  Can I?  I am soooo happy!
I wanted it before I left.  is it really that hard?
I've had the worst case of insomnia for the last week.  I know I could fix it all right now with out another word mentioned but do I really want to go back on Lexapro while I'm recovering from being so sick.  I'm still not done taking my antibiotics though, and I told myself I wouldn't poison my body any more than I already am.  Besides it's not like I'm taking it for depression, but for anxiety.  My insomnia is brought on by my anxiety.  It sucks.  Five more days until a week long vacation!  I'll probably start back on the Lexapro before I leave for NYC, so I have the energy to do everything I want to do while I'm there and not be this sleep deprived zombie girl.  I think I just might crawl into bed soon.  Oohh 2am will be an early night for me which usually wraps up around 4:30-5:00a.m.   I dread payday.  I have bills to pay and a trip to spend money on, oh and that little thing called rent that comes at the first of the month.  MEH!
Yes Morrissey's newest album came out yesterday (the 18th) so if someone has listened to it, or bought it they should definitely tell me if it was/is any good.    It's three in the morning and my ass needs to get to bed before 4 a.m. tonight.  It will be a first in days if I do.
I have this wierd feeling going on inside.    I leave for NYC in one week, and no one knows how much I need it.  I need to get away from my boring practically non-existant life I've been leading here.  Sure I go out, but not like I used to. I need a good kick in the ass or something, and someone to get drunk with and make out with and lose myself with while I'm "far away from home".  Last time it happened in Boston...  Eric sent me an email a while ago talking about how he was moving on the 15th? I told him we'd have to have drinks or lunch or something when I get out there... I love that boy.  He's the sweetest.  Of course if it wasn't for Ray I would never have met him.  I need to contact Ray and Ashley too, just to see what's going on with them, and to find out if they will have a free moment to meet up sometime while I'm out there.  Last October I only got to see Ray for just a little bit at the Interpol show and at the after party and that was it.  At least I got to meet his beautiful and oh-so-nice wife Cybil.  She's a peach.  It was wierd though because just 9 months prior I spent 5 whole days with him. 24 hours a day.  He's a peach too.  Just more of a rancid peach but he definitely has a heart of gold.  Oh I miss my NYC friends and BEN!  How could I NOT see Ben.  He was my cute, ultra-hip room mate before just up and moving to brooklyn with no money and no job and no clothes!  hahaha.    Back to right now. San Francisco.  Monday night.  I have an interview tomorrow.  I can't wait.  I know the job is mine.  Over the last five years I've really developed this skill at faking confidance and sounding like a professional when usually I have no idea what the hell I'm doing and totally winging it.  But everything seems to fall into place somehow.  So I hope tomorrow is the day that everything falls into place for me.  The only downside about getting this job will mean I'll be working two jobs for a while.  A full time 40 hours a week job and a part time 25 hours a week job.  I'm going to be so exhausted.  Oh well.  We all have to suffer a little sometimes right?  I want an awesome FLAT/Apartment come October so I'm going to save, save, save all the money I can until then.  I also need to get a car and thus that requires some sort of saving of the monitary units also.  I know I don't really NEED a car, and that I just want one, but unless you've had one before you can't really say anything.  I've had a car since I was 16!  I'm 26 and have been with out one for 2.5 years and am missing the freedom and luxury that comes along with owning one.  Never mind the endless parking tickets I'll have to pay or the cost of parking in the city or the price of Gas.  The gas station across from my flat now says $2.79 a gallon!!!  I still need/want one.  I won't have to lug groceries home from the store on public transportation or by  foot anymore.  Won't have to worry if the muni/bart is still running in the middle of the night while out at show/club/bar.  That really is the crappiest part.  Not being able to do things because you can't get home or get stranded and have to rely on o
