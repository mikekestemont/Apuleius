So, I've been saying ever since I got home yesterday how much I have to do in order to be ready to go to EFY in the morning.&nbsp; It's already 9, and I still have another load of laundry&nbsp;to do, totally pack all my stuff, completely clean my room and my bathroom (neither of which are very pretty right now..)&nbsp; And yet, here I am writing in my blog.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, I got home from camp yesterday--&nbsp; all in all, it was a really great week... I'd say probably my best out of the 4 times I've gone.&nbsp; The only part that wasn't so cool were these stupid pranks that the 1st years tried to play... they were so stupid, and people really got sensitive...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know, girls can be really stupid sometimes.&nbsp; It was the first year that it worked out that Katie could go with me, and we just had a blast.&nbsp; Our tent was awesome, we laughed ALL the time, and just had fun being retarded.&nbsp; And it also turned out to be incredibly spiritual... getting me in the mood for EFY.&nbsp; I'm so excited about going tomorrow.&nbsp; I just love being able to hang out and have fun with people you know have the same standards you have... and no one cares if you're stupid like I am, you're just able to have fun.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, I know this is a short entry, maybe I'll write more about camp later.&nbsp; I hope everyone is having a great Sabbath.&nbsp;&nbsp; Love ya'll&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Megs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; SOME INSIDE JOKES OF THE WEEK FOR ALL WHO CARE AND WHO WERE THERE--&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Let it BURN!!"-- Katie&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Smells like gophers."-- Katie&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Shut up... and GO TO SLEEP!"--   Jessica &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Gotta get up at the buttcrack of dawn."-- Jill &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ok, that's enough for now.&nbsp; talk to ya'll in a week--&nbsp;&nbsp; leave a post!!
Yup..&nbsp; another BNL song.&nbsp; hehe.&nbsp; So today was just the norm, I guess.&nbsp; I woke up late again for church...&nbsp; I mean, I got there on time and all, I just didn't have as much time as I normally do to get ready.&nbsp; But yeah, church went really well today.&nbsp; I enjoyed Sister Sedwick's lesson... it really made me think.&nbsp; Anyway, then I had choir... then came home.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was wanting to be able to have all my packing done (Girl's Camp tomorrow) early so I could just chill out the rest of the day.&nbsp; But yeah, I didn't really get started 'till about 9, and even then it was kind of that "I'm packing, but not really" type.&nbsp; Anyway, I hope ya'll are having a great day/night.&nbsp;&nbsp; Toodles&nbsp;&nbsp; -- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  QUOTE OF THE DAY-- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  When I grow up I want to be a principal, or a butterfly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; --Some bumpersticker we found in Winchester
So this is my blog.. and my first entry!&nbsp;&nbsp; (yay!)&nbsp;&nbsp; I basically decided to start one of these because&nbsp;Katie got one... and I got jealous.&nbsp; No, j/k.. I have been wanting one for a while.&nbsp; So,&nbsp;I chose&nbsp;"I'm so cool... too bad I'm a loser" well.. first of all because it's in one of Barenaked Ladies songs, but&nbsp;I guess I can kind of relate.&nbsp; Anyway, I'm sure whenever I come on here to put up a new post, I'll start bursting into song like I am now.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, today I woke up at like 11, and then I helped Katie for a while put some of her furniture in her room, and then Jessie, Laurie, Shane, and I went thrifting at Goodwill and the Mercy House.&nbsp; Yeah, they have this big 50's and 60's dance tonight, which sounds way fun.&nbsp; So yeah, they were just buying some awesome clothes for that.&nbsp; And I bought just a bunch of clothes, some for camp... and some just because they were cool.&nbsp; I bought this skirt, I don't really know how to describe it but yeah.. it's pretty grand.&nbsp;&nbsp; Okie dokie,&nbsp;I think that's about&nbsp;all I&nbsp;have for now...&nbsp; hope ya'll have a great evening.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  QUOTE OF THE DAY: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sean, what's wrong??!  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Something horrible has happened. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Is Bob dead?&nbsp;&nbsp;   DID SOMETHING BREAK!!!!!????  &nbsp; ----&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Orange County
S  o, I've been putting off writing in my blog ever since I got back from Washington.... but I know I need to, or else I'll forget everything like I normally do. Ok, so here goes.    Wednesday we got all ready to leave, and we finally got outta here at about 2:30 (PM). Mom was pretty worried because we packed so much-- so with all the weight, she thought the car was gonna freak out or something. But the ride was fine, nothing happened. (for once, Mom's "feelings" weren't reality.) Anywho, Mom had been telling us that our flight was at 7. Well, we found out that it wasn't until 9. So, we had about 4 hours at the airport. (BOORING!). What really made the time drag out was the fact that there were no lines whatsoever for bag-checking and security-goingthrough. hehe. So yeah, we finally got on.. And it was fine, (my first time flying.. EVER!). Then we had a layover in Vegas, which was cool because I'd never seen it. Wow... pretty colors. So we get in our next flight, and everything's going fine. I actually fell asleep on Josh's belly... and when I woke up I realized there was a little puddle of drool. (eww!) --- Think any less of me now? Yes? Oh, I don't care. Well, anyway. Like a minute after I woke up (so I was still in my "sleepy-state") we hit some horrible turbulance. But because I was so out of it, I had no clue what was going on. Drinks were flying everywhere, people were screaming, and some were puking. No, it was not a fun experience. I was probably more scared than I should have been though.. :-( So yeah, we finally get in.. And we're walking through the airport and Mom and Dad start hugging this guy they see, and they just make casual conversation. A
