Hello once again...I have been a slacker for a few days I know but thought I would write something to try and keep this going! If any of my many readers get the chance to do a blog like this, I suggest they try it! Its quite a nice way of keeping a diary of sorts. Saturday night out was cool. Matty had a nice stag night, although he may well not remember it! We started off with a meal [ Italian ] before trying a few bars out that I had not been in before...Walkabouts was great...watched some footy in their too! Ended up at Jumpin Jaks down by the sea front...my first time there too. A little expensive to get in and the drinks too....but a great atmosphere. Ended up dancing like a mentalist. Matts' future wife ended up there too on her Hen Night...kinds weird but theye didn't just 'get off' with each other so not too bad. We got home at 3am and I slept until about 10am...then had to not only contend with the hangover but also some mad tummy ache too. Which carried on for about 48 hours, until a feast of Rennies got it fairly under control! Still a bit niggly though.... Was so ill that I even turned down the chance to go to the pub to see the England vs France game on Sunday night! Although...possibly good job I didn't! Say no more! There hasn't been too much else going on, due to the gut ache! I have turned down two 'naughty sessions' the last two days..so I must have been poorly!! Just been enjoying the amount of footy on the telly at decent times! Anyway...that is all for now...hope to report back in a couple of days!
I missed a couple of days there but not sure anyone will have noticed! I did send this URL to quite a few people...if you are one of them, then I would love some feedback. At the bottom of each entry, you will see the word 'comment'...if you click on that, you should see a place to leave some nice words! It can then be almost interactive!  It is very late now...I had some trouble with my electric key metre and had to wait up for a nice man to come along and save me from darkness. Not the band though..I like them...although it would have been a bit weird if he was saving me from them!  Its been a very busy day. Went to the new club shop at AFC Bournemouth with Phil, my bro. It was huge...but didn't seem to have much in that wasn't there before. I'm sure it will be lovely soon. While there, we took a look at the pitch through the gaps...the place where we will be playing in a few short weeks! Bearing in mind that they will be ripping the pitch up in August, it still looks pretty well cared for. Still pretty green,,,a couple of bare patches maybe but still looks great to play on! We cannot wait!  We then popped into Poole for an hour before travelling on to a nice Harvester for dinner [ haddock and chips! ]...we met Lloyd, Tall Paul and Kris there, before we all popped along to the Rossmore Leisure Centre for our weekly dose of 5-a-side. That hall is like a sauna...we sweated buckets! I scored four goals tonight I think...including a right foot curler into the far corner and a SPECTACULAR left foot screamer! We still lost though!  Back to the Harvester for a couple of drinks...then back home.  I am now a very tired bunny! Its 12.45am and I need sleep. We are in Bournemouth tomorrow night for Matt Burts' stag night...having a meal before having a few drinks. A rumour is that we will then go to For Your Eyes Only...a local strip club! Not sure the funds will expand to that...but we'll see!  So...signing out for today...maybe see some feedback soon!
An inspired title for the next instalment eh??   I'm still not sure who I am writing this for...I know at least one person has read what I wrote yesterday though! If you are here, reading this and you are not me, then I'd love it if you left some comments ok! I spose that if no-one ever does, then it might be interesting for me to look back at in the future though...  Well...the big news yesterday was that my windscreen was fixed! It only took nearly two weeks but we got there in the end. It saved me cleaning it anyway...although that is a bit extreme as a continued policy I think.  Didn't actually get up to much yesterday apart from that...well, having to wait in for windscreen man scuppered any hopes of actually leaving the building! I ended up waffling on MSN for ages and then caught up on my Pheonix Nights Series One DVD..surely one of the funniest series ever shown on telly?  I was planning to go to Salisbury today with Mum...we always enjoy going there, it makes a nice change. She just rung and said it was too hot for her to start walking around there though, so we are going to Poole instead...with its air conditioned shopping centre and plenty of cafes for her to sit down at! Never mind, it should be nice to see her again anyway...I only get to shop with her when I'm off work.   So...I better get me arse in gear...she is picking me up in five minutes! Wonder what I'll end up buying today....!!
I am not sure how often I will write here...we all start with good intentions! It may well be that I am writing to myself anyway! I am hoping that a few of my friends will pop along every so often and if by some miracle, people I have never met before come along too, that'll be great.  Today is Tuesday 8th June 2004 and it is just after 2pm...2.11pm to be exact! The weather is beautiful and has b
