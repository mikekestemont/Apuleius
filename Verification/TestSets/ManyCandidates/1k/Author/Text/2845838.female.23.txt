(HU)WHAAAATTTTTT????!!!!!!!  New account again.  Which is Good.  Nothing much really.  Back to training again.   Every morning before 7 am. Have to rush to our office, almost running. When I arrive, right after the entrance~  I would: Pause, turn around, face this computer. Type in my ID number, read "Login".  Type in my password.  Tap, tap, tap my foot. Wait for the system to register.  As if I'm in a REAL hurry.  Pretending to be late.  Then I would: Pause, turn around, head to the CR. As if almost running again.  My hair flapping behind me.  Look around for somebody I know.  Smile, smile, and yes, another smile. As if I'm in a REAL hurry.  Pretending to be late.  Then I would: Pause, turn around, face the mirror. Comb my hair.  Dub on some lip gloss.  As if I'm in a REAL hurry.  Pretending to be late.  Then for the last time, I would: Pause, turn around, head back to the lobby. Pretending to be late, I'm honestly truly really not. I just walk fast as if I'm always in a rush. Because I just love pretending to be late.
Main Entry:  insomnia  Function: noun Etymology: Latin, from insomnis sleepless, from in- + somnus sleep -- more at SOMNOLENT : prolonged and usually abnormal inability to obtain adequate sleep  Yes, I don't know why. For the last few days it's so hard for me to get some sleep. I'm just super tired. I guess. I have been drained~ Emotionally. Intellectually. Physically. Socially. Spiritually.  This morning I went to take up EPT. The English Proficiency Test. It went out well. I hope. Then had a little chitchat with a not-so-close officemate. Nothing much really. Let's just say~ Damn. I can't keep my mouth shut. I was able to share things to him things that I shouldn't have.  Yeah. Stupid me. Really. When will I ever learn. Not to just trust anybody. Unless I got to KNOW them. I can't keep doing that you know? I just can't. That's my weakness. I easily trust people.  Oh well. I hope he's somebody that can be trusted. Let's just cross our fingers. Cross our toes. Do the yoga. Haha. Call a shrink.  Anyway~ Tonight, they will be having a night out at Camp Zitro. In celebration of? Our last day of work today? The End Of Life? Super super sad. I don't feel like going. Really. So I'd rather watch some movie. With Kristine. I don't care if it's just "Milan". Hehe~ I'll sleep. For all I care. Let me just do that. Or watch a horror movie. Scare the hellshit out of me. Yeah. For all I care. Let me just do that too.  ~That's all for now.
Yesterday I was so depressed and so so down. I had my third interview with the company's client the other day. And I was so so stupid because I asked a senseless question and I was like- blabbing and blabbing around... No thought at all! Some of us received their Job Orders from the company. And I don't have mine yet. Which is why I feel so discouraged. Maybe I don't deserve to be here. I'm not worthy- somebody just helped me that's why I got in... you know, all those self-defeating thoughts, the paraphernalias of anti-self... bad, bad BAD. And so my day was sooo dull, super dull, plus I was turned down by another company later that day telling me- right on my face- that the result came out negative, which means- I didn't pass the exam. They really didn't check it. For sure. It was too quick. Unfair. Maybe because my present company is their competitor. They asked me where tahell i came from before they slapped me. *Sigh* Oh well. Wutevah. And so there was I, really really weak. Drained. Discouraged. Depressed... When I arrived at work... my friends greeted me like they hadn't seen me for a vewy long time... They were trying to get in touch with me that morning... damn my cel was broken... so they said I have another interview. I thought I failed. Well, good. For me. Then I received a recommedation email from the HR by our Account Manager. Wow. It made up my day!  ~So now, I'm up and alive again... which is why- I need a shrink, shrink, SHRINK... haha.
Guilt Stricken   I shouldn't have typed my blog below :( I feel bad. Just not me. Bad Sashi! ~and I stand corrected... So let me do something about it... Please hold... *tsk* *tsk* *tsk*  It's done.  ~Are you sure that's all YOU can do? Did it make me feel better? ~Can it make HER feel better? (Now, I'm sounding link a shrink)  I need a shrink, shrink, SHRINK!!! Haha.
I need a SHRINK! :(   Now, I'm confused. I don't know where to write. In my Blogger? Or in my OpenDiary? My OpenDiary account is sort of... too revealing because I made mentions there of several people. Those I hate, I like, I love, I'm angry at... you name it... I probably have it. You can sense my feelings there. Some mushy, corny stuffs. Ugh. You can't blame me. I'm an emotional being! So to make it short, it's never safe to publicize it to just anyone. You'll probably realize that I do change a lot... in terms of my my emotional wavelength... what I like right now, what I like 4 hours from now... I call that - dynamicism. Or is it? Whatever...  So anyway, right now I'm so angry, so pissed off, so annoyed! Grrr...  I hate hearing her voice.  (I learned something from rhye - he said "If they hate you , it only means they really wanted be like you.")  Yes, I hate her but it doesn't mean I
