Jaclyn and I went to go see Notebook. That is by far the most greatest movie in the world. Chick Flick wise. The guy that plays Noah is so dreamy. He's in Remember the Titans too. But anyway, Jay and I are going to buy the movie when it comes out on video. I think we're going to have another Simon Bitch episode. Well Magan just happened to be at the theatre so afterwards we decided to go to Denny's. Nick showed up by himself and we all chilled for a while. Magan and Jaclyn left around 10 and 11pm. But Nick and I decided to pull an all nighter. We were there until about 2:30pm until Brandon called, saying that we got a 20 pack. So we chilled at Brandon's until about 3am. Nick and I went to QT to get a carton of Luckies. Omg that was no Quick Trip. We were there for at least a 1/2 hour trying to rounge up enough money just to get the cardon. We were about 4 bucks short. We tried everything. We tried all of the credit cards in our wallets, we counted all of our change. Finally we got a cardon! Since I payed for 1/2 of it of course I got a pack. You owe me Nick. Big time. We chilled at Nick's house until Johnnny and Scotty got back from some place in the middle of Bummble Fuck. I saw David. He looks really great and he's doing really good. I'm proud of him. Nick got a new kitten. It's soooooo cute. He has thumbs. It's weird. We went back to Denny's at like maybe 4am. Hungout with Scotty and Johnny and some beasts showed up, but those chicks left early. lol Scotty and Johnny were talking so much shit about them. Nick and I got tired so we left Johnny and Scotty and went home....what a night. I guess that all nighter never worked out.
VIVA LA MEXICO!  Lets start from the very beginning. The ride there was pretty nice, it wasnt as bad as I thought it would be. We sang the whole way there. Classics mostly. And Taylor insisted on playing Yellowcard the whole way there. When we finally got there the first stop we made was at a liquor store. We got 6 bottles of vodka. We were originally suppose to stay at the Fiesta De Cortez but when we got there it looked like shit. The pictures on the internet were false advertisement. We decided to go to the other side of the ocean where my family usually stays. We ended up staying at the Las Gaviotas. Which was faackin awesome! Our facial expressions were so drastic from the first hotel to the second. The view was beautiful. Something you'd think you'd only see in movies. And the water was warm as all hell. Alright past all this boring shit. The only thing that sucked about that hotel was those damn stairs. We went straight to the beach and in the ocean. We shopped around a bit. Ate food. DIDNT DRINK THE WATER! "whacha doin? eatin chocolate. where's you get it? from your dog."
This will be my last and final entry before I go off onto my wonderous journey to Mexico. Where I will explore many seneries and be introduced to many different cultures. Awww I can hear it now, the waves in the ocean the birds in the sky.....I'm just kidding I'm going to Mexico to have a kick ass time with my family and friends. Party all night and tan all day. I'll be back on Saturday night. Everyones packing right now. I'm done already. Jakes home today too. I'm so stoked because he's coming with us. This is going to be faackin sweet.  Miguel will be on his way back home to Sacrameto, California by the time I'll be home. So we're going to hangout today. We got pretty close working together for those few months. I'm going to miss that kid. I hope Magan agrees to stop by his house when we go on that road trip across Cali in December. Considering what they went through. Because no matter what I'm going to come visit him when we go. Jesse and Ryan are leaving to Nor Cal this week too. Which sucks because I'm most deffinatly going to miss those guys. Now those were some good times. I know we're going to see them again when we visit Randy in December. I hope that dont forget me. But I'll still them fuckers. Well, off to help my mom pack.
You know who I havent been so close with lately? The twins. We were like best friends. We had our party scene together. But it seems like ever since we havent been partying so much anymore. We drifted apart. I love Heather and Magan. I dont want to stop hanging out with them just because all of our UTI buddies are leaving. And I dont want to say that we only hungout because of the drinking. Because that totally wasnt it. I really like hanging out with them. But ever since we all got jobs its been harder to see eachother. Heather told me that I've been the one thats been distant lately. I hope thats not what they really think. I still want to be best friends with them. Best friends forever right? Well, I'm scared that Jr. year we wont be as good as friends. I really dont want that. Oh, speaking of Heather and Magan. Magan just called to ask for my livejournal website thing. Well, that means that shes going to read this. Uhh thats going to be kind of awkward. Well, Magan yes I miss hanging out with you. Summer almost over and its deffinalty not what I expected. I expected all of us to hangout everyday. But thats not what happened. For the rest of the summer we should make it happen. What happened to Heather, Magan and Alicia Best Friends? We need to hangout m
