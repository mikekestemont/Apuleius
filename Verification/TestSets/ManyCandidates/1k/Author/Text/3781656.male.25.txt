I've been thinking about the morality of mocking people. I think we do it because we have to appear better than the next guy in order to attract people like Connie Chung and David Schwimmer. And the easiest way to do that is not to work on actually being the best guy, but to bring down the next guy so that you seem like you're better.  It's easy to call the woman with a beard ugly, the man who gets airlifted out of his house on Geraldo because he weighs eight hundred pounds fat, and the teenager who does not know the alphabet stupid. But it's not so easy to volunteer to shave the woman's beard, or pilot the helicopter hauling the man out of the house, or go down to the local McDonalds to pick up an application for the illiterate. No one is perfect, and we should remember that the next time we are making fun of white males and others whom life has dealt a difficult hand.
The woman who runs my house would make a good mate for Dick Cheney. She is obsessive, conniving, and foams at the mouth.  I live in a group house. I'm never going to do it again, or at least, not unless I've flown my prospective housemates to Vienna to be examined by a random Austrian. Those people know how to sniff out weirdos, and when they do, they send them to America to touch boobies and become governors.  I'll tell you more about Dick's lover, and the Formosan male housemate who gets Victoria's Secret, a little later.
I work, as many do, at a large corporation that exploits Canadian labor to produce goods of shoddy quality with high price tags. My work requires an intellectual backbone but no legs. Indeed, the only physical labor I perform each day is to get into my chair, and had I an East German maid handy, I would not even need to do that myself.  Sometimes I look out my window at the road below, hoping that a deer, elk, or moose cross it and create some excitement. But the deer, elk, and moose were all killed years ago by the first Republicans, who came to our country in the late seventies to escape persecution by Dirk Nowitzki's mother, who was, and remains, awfully tall. So instead I work and ponder the great mysteries of life, many of which concern people's reluctance to use the word "phlegmatic" in casual discourse.
I hesitated before getting a blog. I don't like the sound of it. "Blog." Not much good rhymes with it. But more importantly, I know someone who writes a livejournal, and he's got some real problems. He likes to use his livejournal to tell folks what he buys at the supermarket. That's not that interesting. It's a little interesting, because he buys a lot of food, but really not all that interesting. I think you have to be a little arrogant to start one. Who cares about what you think, unless you are Macauley Culkin? Maybe it's just important to be entertaining and not take yourself too seriously. All I know is that I need a distraction from work.
A co-worker of mine refers to her lover as "partner." I thought that was awesome, until I found out that my co-worker's lover is a man.  I could understand the nomenclature if my co-worker were a cowboy. Not only do cowboys like to use the word "partner," but cowboys are men, and if she were a man, she could refer to her male lover as "partner" because she'd be pretty damn gay.  But this just doesn't make sense.
The other day I saw a woman try to use her Giant Bonus Card to get a discount on pants at Nordstroms.  Someone, I think it was a neoconservative, shat on my car the same day.  I moved out of the group house. The woman who runs the house was a little sad, perhaps because she knew there would be one fewer person to watch her act like Satan. The Taiwanese housemate doesn't like to watch her act like Satan. He prefers to order lingerie from Victoria's Secret for himself. He can be nasty sometimes.
Have you ever noticed how George Bush "looks forward" to addressing any controversial matter reporters remind him about rather than actually addressing it?  He "looks forward" to meeting with the 9-11 commission He "looks forward" to figuring out what went wrong with the intelligence in Iraq. He "looks forward" to having a debate with the American people about the issues.  We have to hope that he also "looks forward" to getting kicked out of the White House, living the rest of his life as an object of ridicule and scorn by most of the country, and going down as the worst president ever.
Dick Cheney's would-be lover was at it again last night. She was in a bad mood, so she took all the toilet paper from the bathroom and went into her room. Who does that?   It's her house. If she wants people to walk on her rugs with sloppy bowels, that's her prerogative. I think it's kind of nasty.  She likes writing sticky-notes to tell her tenants what they are doing wrong. But she didn't write one to tell us about why she had absconded with the toilet paper. It's a shame, because I would have used it to wipe my ass.
One thing that irritates me is people who dress their dogs. Another is people who say that they are going to do something that they have no intention of doing out of a false compulsion to be nice or to make a token effort to fulfill their own moral expectations of themselves.  I've done it, and I don't blame my friends when they do it. But I find it really obnoxious when others do it.  I've been thinking that maybe we could all stop doing it. For this, I think we need to look to our nation's reigning moral authority, George W. Bush.  We all know t
