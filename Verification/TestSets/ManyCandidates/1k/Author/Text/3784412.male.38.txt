Early in May I was driving in southern Indiana and the lilac was in full bloom.  It was a beautiful day so I had the windows open in my vehicle.  I was thoroughly enjoying the weather and the sweet smell of lilac.  A week later the lilac was in full bloom here in Michigan and again I had the occasion to drive with the windows open and enjoy the lilac.  That is a smell that will dispel even the worst mood I might have.  It just makes me feel so good.  Think now, about your favorite smell.  Imagine you can smell it right now.  Remember how you feel when you smell it?  You breathe in deeply.  You exhale slowly.  It’s almost a spiritual feeling.  It just makes you feel good all over.  Your whole body enjoys the smell.  You feel such delight!  Have you got it?  Can you recall that feeling right now? Now keep thinking about that as you read the following scripture.  This is from Isaiah 11:1-3 (NIV) A shoot will come up from the stump of Jesse; 	From his roots a Branch will bear fruit. The Spirit of the LORD will rest on him— 	The Spirit of wisdom and of understanding, 	The Spirit of counsel and of power, 	The Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD— And he will delight in the fear of the LORD.   Did you catch it?  Did you see how what you’re thinking about fit with this scripture?  This is about Jesus.  It says that Jesus will delight in the fear of the Lord.  When it came to doing God’s will Jesus had the feeling of Delight.  In fact the Hebrew word here is talking about the enjoyment of smell, just like you’re thinking about right now.  This was Jesus’ attitude towards worshipping God and doing His will.  Let’s have this same attitude as we worship God and do His will.

Welcome to my blog site.    Leave a post to say "Hi".
While Ginger is in Australia, Brandon went to camp for the week of the 4th.  So Suzanne & I went to Traverse City, MI for a little get away.  We had told Ginger to call my cell phone and we waited all week for her to call.  We didn't get one.  When we got home there was a message on the answering machine from Ginger.  She called Wed. Evening and said she was doing fine and having fun.  Up to that point her favorite thing was that she got to hold a koala bear.  She did not sound a bit homesick on the message.    I hope she is having better weather than we had in Traverse City.  The temperature never exceeded 63 and it was cloudy and rainy every day except Monday.  On Wednesday we took a two hour cruise on the tall ship  The Manitou .  It was very cold and windy but fun.  At least the cruise lasted only two hours unlike Giligan's.  I helped raise the sails which is kinda cool.  I'll get some pictures posted after while.
Well it finally has happened!  After so many months of planning and saving, Ginger is on her way to Australia as a student ambassador.  For more information on what this is check out  urlLink www.studentambassadors.org .     Her flight left at about 3pm.  They will arrive in LA at about 5pm local time.  Then leave LA about 10pm (the 2nd) and arrive in Sidney at about 6am (the 4th).  As soon as they get off the plane the fun begins.  They go directly to see the Olympic village.  They'll see the Sydney Opera House, swim the great coral reef and many other things all while staying in beautiful 4-star resorts.
