Ok if anyone knows a good hit man hook me up!. My parents have started WW3 and i get pulled to either side! yay sucky life! Anyway lets get down to the real reason i wanted to post, ok on gaia i got this pm it was did anyone ever tell you.. So i opened it and the kid said your hot as hell so in my mind i was thinking "who the fuck thinks pixels are hot?". Well I'll tell you who, 12 year old boys that's who. Seriously why the hell do i only get hit on by twelve year olds? It's not fair I'm to old to be hit on by 12 year old that's a 3 year age difference!! No one say anything about my crushes i know it's not any different but seriously.... Anyway i cantered presto today and i made up with Ana so were cool again. Elf boy hasn't been on and i haven't seen Ryu for years it seems i guess my RPG peaked and now is starting it's steady and eventual flaming death, oh well it was fun while it lasted. i guess I'll just stick to other peoples from now on.. It;'s sad to i thought that one was going to go someplace good and maybe like work and have a really story with a goal... It backfired and now I'm back to square one. Well my new underage stalker is bugging me and he can't see this (thank you parental controls!) so i got to go! Shimby
urrgha I'd like to say one thing, who ever upstairs decided to make most boys annoying jackasses and all the good ones gay needs to be fired it was a cruel joke and there needs to be pay back. Take my current head over heels crush, Karl OK first off i have issues talking to guys i always have and it's not something that's gone change over night. So Karl well he probably thinks I'm a bitch who thinks she's better then him because i never say hi and i avoid eye contact and everything i know i shouldn't but i can't help it my mind completely shuts down around him. i can't even talk to him about anything with out stuttering or dropping something or making a fool of myself. i mean come on how hard is it to talk to someone one who's nice and rides horses and is not a flaming idiot or as far as i can tell gay? In my case it's harder then doing a bi cranial bi pass while riding Superman ride of steel. I wish i could just give myself a wake up call and get with the program and stop being a stupid wimp but it's not that easy. *sigh* this is Turing into more of a rant then a journal now isn't it? I'm sorry guys this is another one of those depressing blogs were some teenager who thinks she's the worst off in the world moans and complains... I'll stop now with his final message, save the whales and the other species of the environment, don't were fur and make sure you thank your pets for being such loving companions who don't mind if you cry into there shoulder. The same goes for friends and don't ever do something stupid like lose one over a guy because you never know when you'll need them or when you'll lose them forever to something bigger then us all. Hold onto your childhood don't let it slip away keep it as long as you can and don't let anyone tell you to grow up. Keep  your head up when you feel like crawling into a hole and staying there for forever and never be afraid to speak your mind. Freedom is only as free as you chose to make it and if you stop watching even for a second someone can take it away from you, the cost of freedom is constant vigulance thats what my history teacher taught me and I've made it my motto for the rest of my life. never think that one person can't change the world because you know what? they can and it takes that one person to change the way the rest of the world thinks. remember what your forefathers died for protect it well -Shimby
yo just me and here we go. Ana's confusing me and every time i try to help it blows up in my face. kana's in the hospital I'm not sure what happened but we think she hurt herself over a grade and some other problems. I'm not her friend really but i am still worried about her and i wanna go make sure shes OK but i don't know what hospital shes in. it's the end of the school year only a week of finals to go and then I'm a sophmore... man it's scary i can't believe it i had a hard enough time maturing to freshman status what am i gonna do as a sophomore? blow it entirely? make a fool of myself and have to move to another country? i mean really it's not like i have anyone who really knows who i am, what makes me tick. sure my friends think they know me but how much of what they know is just part of this elaborate facade i put up around myself day in and day out? Is what they think i am what i really am? i can't even answer those questions for myself i don't know why I'm trusting complete strangers to answer them for me. i just wish like every little girl forced to grow up that prince charming will sweep down off his white horse and carry me away into the sunset were we shall live in happily ever after forever and always. but i think someone told my prince that my hairs always frizzy i can't keep my temper and my glasses are always crooked. someone let it slip that i try to p
