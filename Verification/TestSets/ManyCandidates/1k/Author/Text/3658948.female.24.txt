Man. Guess what? I got fired. To be really honest... I'm profoundly relieved. My boss was (and still is) a snotty, manipulative bitch with atrocious spelling and grammar in addition to a massive inferiority complex. My first day off the job I was a little stunned, kinda pissed because I forgot my favorite pen in the office, but otherwise thrilled at my new block of free time. And the freedom has only gotten sweeter.  However, I'm being careful to remain occupied and active despite my unemployment, and not to fall into my old pre-employment "ER" addiction. (No, Noah Wyle or the Croatian guy didn't do it for me; oddly enough, it was "Rocket" Romano, the little snide bald guy that turned my crank. I know, he's old, short, bald, and not even remotely attractive -- or at least, that's what everyone tells ME. I liked him because he was the only non-schmaltzy character on the show, he had those hot little forearms, the best lines ("What's the matter? Is Prince Harry in rehab again?"), and a lovely bald head. To be bald with a gorgeous skull is really something, especially with his bone structure. But hey, I'm over it.) Killing Romano with that stupid helicopter ruined that series forever, even though it was already swirling in the crapper by the time he kicked it.   On Friday I'm supposed to finally get my Desserts for Democracy bake sale off the ground. The proceeds are supposed to go to the John Kerry campaign, but honestly, I don't like him. I don't care how many medals he's won in what situation that I most likely couldn't have done were I in Vietnam; politically, he's a big wuss. The only thing I like about him is his wife -- apparently she's got enough backbone for the both of them. Yes, Howard Dean was too politically inexperienced to maintain frontrunner status, but I don't think Edwards should have dropped out. After Dean, I liked him best. The idea of Dick Gephardt becoming Veep irks me, because then it'll be TWO wussy Democrats in the running, and I am sick to death of seeing my party bend over for the Republicans. I'm thinking long and hard about emigrating to Canada, but I figure, hell, THEY'RE the ones that suck, why should I leave? Also, their version of the neocons may win prime minister elections, thereby ruining that option as well. Hmmmm.
Thanks for posting. Here's the text of your post, so it's immediately visible to anyone who arrives:  I really don't like Democrats who won't hear dissent such as Bill Clinton, Al Gore, John Kerry, Maxine Waters, Charlie Rangel, David Bonior, Nancy Pelosi, Alan Dershowitz, The entire cast of CNN, The entire NBC news organization, the entire news organization of ABC, the entire news organization at CBS, the entire staff of Washington Post, the entire staff of the New York Times, Jimmy Carter, Madeline Albright, John Podesta, Hillary Clinton, Tom Daschle, Chuck Schumer, Jay Rockefeller, Robert Byrd, Ted Kennedy, Dick Durbin, Herb Kohl, John McCain (yeah, he's a Democrat), Jake Reed, Diane Feinstein, Barbara Boxer, Carl Levin, Sheila Jackson-Lee, Martin Meehan, and many others.  I'd also like to answer your second post, as to why American Indians think we're solely entitled to describe ourselves as Native Americans.  Although I don't feel as though I'm able to adequately answer for ALL American Indians everywhere, it's partly because we're not really Indians - people from India are Indians, and to describe myself as an "Indian" creates a bit of confusion, because no one from my family has roots there. There really isn't a correct term for the tribes who lived here when white people came (if you then decided to call us "tribes," there are tribes in Canada, New Guinea, Mongolia, and other countries, so that, too could be confusing), so "Native American" is the designation that is so far the most accurate. And we consider ourselves entitled to it because that's who we are.  Regarding your first post about Democrats who refuse to hear dissent, I also can't answer for any of the people listed with confidence, because I don't know or represent them. However, I think Tucker Carlson of CNN's Crossfire is a strong conservative, as is Lou Dobbs, Wolf Blitzer, and possibly others I'm forgetting to mention. Have you written to the people you've listed with your views to see if they've agreed or disagreed? Since you just left those two posts, I'm not sure entirely what your views are, or if I'd wholly disagree with all of them.  The reason why I listed those people is because their hatred and intolerance toward those they disagree with scares me. When Ann Coulter says, "We should invade their country, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity," or that every brown-skinned man should be regarded suspiciously, it goes against the principles the Bill of Rights and Constitution were founded on, and reminds me of the scary period in our history when the U.S. Cavalry systematically slaughtered Native American Tribes during throughout the 1800's during the period of Western expansion. When Tom DeLay, a.k.a. "The Hammer" comes down on fellow Republicans for stepping out of what he views as the party line for Republicans, that scares me. Why does he have so much power in Congress? What ruling entitled him to it?  There are Republicans I like and occasionally agree with, such as Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas (thanks for the apology, and your efforts to get it passed in Congress), Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska for calling 'em as he sees 'em, and yes, John McCain. He's not a Democrat because he has a spine and votes with his conscience -- he's a Republican because he believes in fiscal responsibility, opposes abortion and supports the NRA anmong other things. And Olympia Snowe rocks, too.  As Paul Wellstone said, "Politics is not about left, right, or center. Politics is not about money or power games, or winning for the sake of winning. Politics is about the improvement of p
