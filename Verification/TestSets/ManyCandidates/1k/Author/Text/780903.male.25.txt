Bought a really detailed map of the area (Professor Pathfinder's Harvard University -- I recommend it).  I should've done that sooner.  I've been wandering in the darkness but no more.  No more inadvertently taking the longest path possible to get everywhere.  No more hoping and praying that the next corner would be familiar enough that I'd know where to turn next.  And all for just $4.95.  Plus a 5% rebate at the end of the year (bought it at the Coop).  Started delving into my reading.  Easily distracted by the Mets game, answering e-mails, eating, sleeping, and going to the bathroom.  It's slow going so far, but I have to admit it's kind of comforting to be a student again.  I can deal with reading assignments better than I can deal with 401k plans.
Exploring Harvard Square this morning, then doing my reading for class on Tuesday.  This is just a placeholder for a post later today.  Most likely subjects -- Harvard Square, or "my reading for class."  We'll see which one gives me something funny to write about.  I'd put my money on Harvard Square.  At least there's no baseball strike.  I have a funny story about the baseball strike, actually.  I was talking to a couple of people and this one guy gets a cell phone call.  He hangs up.  "There's no baseball strike."  Someone called to tell him.  Not more than twenty seconds later, my cell phone rings.  "There's no baseball strike."  Someone called to tell me.  I thought this was hilarious.  This is how you know you're a baseball fan -- when someone calls you to tell you there's no strike.
Assigned seats in our classes.  Each seat has a number, each student has a number, we make the match.  This way the professors have a seating chart and can call on us.  Can't wait.  Had a tour of the library today.  Printing costs 5 cents a page, copies cost 10 cents a page.  Huh?  The best line of the library tour, said by our tour guide (who was the nicest librarian I've ever met, by the way!) -- "This is the largest academic law library in the world.  I say "academic" because there is one library that's bigger.  The Library of Congress.  They're slightly bigger than we are.  Slightly."  The second best line of the library tour -- "In the bridge between buildings are some bean bag chairs.  Students like to sit in them.  And late at night, sometimes we find couples doing more than just sitting in them."  The third best line of the library tour -- "Over there is where you can talk on your cell phones.  It looks private but the way the walls are, we at the reference desk can hear every word you say.  So you may think it's private, but we can hear you."
I think I heard "...and I have just one more piece of paper to give you..." about fifty times today.  Stacks and stacks of stuff.  Stuff like this:  Information Technology Services packet (printing costs 5 cents a page.  That kind of sucks.)  Lexis-Nexis ID cards, daily planner with pen, big glossy brochure, sweepstakes entry (can win a Lexus -- oh, I get it!  Lexis, Lexus!  So funny!!), and some advertising propaganda rectangular sheet of paper with no information on it.  Westlaw bookmark, pen, and law students handbook all in a fancy box, legal summary book, manual, ID cards, coffee mug, and fake velvet case (to match the Fleet Bank sunglasses case).  Apparently, Lexis and Westlaw are competitors in the legal research game. Each one wants to woo students to their system.  I'm not sure I fully understand yet.  Their tables at orientation were right next to each other.  I was kinda hoping they'd start fighting.  Celebrity Deathmatch: Lexis-Nexis v. Westlaw.  And no one but law students would be tuning in....  But it is a good song idea.  We'll see later.  Playing it Safe: A Guide for students, faculty, and staff  This guide introduces the R.A.C.E. acronym for fire safety --   R escue  A larm  C onfine  E xtinguish  (As opposed to  R un  A way  C arrying  E verything).  Services for students with disabilities brochure "The law school will make appropriate changes in examination procedures for students with special needs."  What if my special need is the answer key?  Yearbook order form ("the price goes up so act now...")  Privacy request form, in case you don't want your e-mail address made public.  This is useful because the e-mail addresses are composed of the first letter of your first name and the first 7 letters in your last name.  So if you keep it private, no one can ever figure it out...  Deferred examination policy -- "if four or more exams are scheduled in a row..."  How many classes are these people taking?  Four exams in a row?  Drug and alcohol policy -- "food and non-alcoholic beverages must be available at any event where alcohol is served."  Oh yeah?  Good food?  Is it free?
Wednesday's observations, one day late (just got my computer hooked up to the network)  10:03 AM  We had an all-dorm-residents barbecue last night, and then the first Bar Review (the oh-so-law-student way of saying trip to a bar) later on at night.  It's nice that they had something organized going on so I wouldn't be stuck in my room watching American Idol.  Which actually was pre-empted by the Red Sox-Yankees game on the local Fox affiliate.  But American Idol is apparently such a phenomenon that they let viewers know during the Red Sox game -- I caught about a half hour inbetween barbecue and bar -- that it would air (in full!) after the news after the game.  Got back to my room at 11:30 in time to see the contestants waving goodbye.  But -- and this is truly pathetic -- I had my mom tape it for me, so I'll see it at some point in the future, probably after the winner's career has already come and gone twice over.  So far it's seemed like i
