The blogger is now online. yay. giddy yup!

urlLink This  freaked me out when I was in 6th grade so much. I remember rewinding it over and over. Still spooks me.
eep why is the  urlLink GURT CAM  broken? stupid gurtcam. People are bugging me to update my website. :Þ I'm just too busy with  urlLink other things . And the other things I am busy with I am lazy about. I'm sorry. I guess I am just lazy. I'll try to keep more up to date in the journal.
I took  urlLink www.dmbirc.org  offline for a bit untill it is absolutley finished. I keep finding little things that I want to change on it. Everyone that signs my guestbook rocks [except one or two but i wont name names :Þ] Thank you for taking the time to say you stoped by and what-not. Later..
Hi. its February! one week till my birthday.  urlLink buy me stuff  please. :)
bacbad:  gurt: will you link to  urlLink dream-networks.net  on your sites?  GURT:  sure. hang on  GET HOSTED.
I won't be on  urlLink IRC  or  urlLink AIM  or any chat stuff much lately. I need to get away from my cyber palz™ for a little while. You can  urlLink e-mail  me or call me and I'll be happy to talk.   things i plan on doing while im not chating... [in no kind of order] -get a steady job. -work with Mike on the songs we've written so far. -save money. -finish filling out the financial aid stuff. -finish  urlLink dmbirc.org  so that I can pass it off to someone who can update it regularly. -work on artwork. -find out who I am.    I talked to my boss, Rob at  urlLink Saratoga Web  and he said he's got a lot of work for me to do now so hopefully this will turn into something steady.  I'm excited about that and it couldn't have happened at a better time.
I have a fax number now.  urlLink 707.982.1760
The DNS stuff is finally all fixed now.

urlLink Jim Gallagher  rules. He let me play with  urlLink glass . it was beyond fun! Thank you!
I went and saw  urlLink Skrape  tonight in Albany. It was an excellent show and the band was really nice. They signed a  urlLink poster  for me. whoop.  urlLink Buy  thier CD " urlLink New Killer America ".
I went to  urlLink Best Buy  and bought  urlLink 13 Ways To Bleed On Stage  by  urlLink Cold . It's a decent cd and only  urlLink 10 bucks . Yeah.. I know.. Scooter  urlLink sounds  like the guy from  urlLink Bush .
I went out today. I went to get my hair cut and then to work. I was not needed at work. Anyhow.. Mike and I went to the mall. I bought a  urlLink FOX  hat and matching sticker for my bass.. some  urlLink jeans  and a new small  urlLink aerobie . Hooray.    "Mary sits down by the shoreline.. she wants the ducks to be her friends.."     "I know. This time. I know this time she's gonna come around"

I know  urlLink this  is kinda old, but  urlLink Letterman  rocks. And I need an update. Thanks to  urlLink Star  and her blog for reminding me about that  urlLink top ten list .
April Fools. Yeah.. I had messed with the site as a joke. No one got it. Oh well. I have  urlLink new shoes , and you don't. The woman that sold them to me was nice and cute.

The host for  urlLink the guestbook  shit the bed and I lost like 4 entries. Bastards! Also, I updated the  urlLink contacts  page so that you can add me to the appropriate account by clicking on the icon and also to include my  urlLink Yahoo! Messenger  account as well as my  urlLink Jabber  account. Jabber is great. sorta. It has its ups and downs, but the interface is way better than  urlLink Trillian  in my opinion.  I need to get a hold of  urlLink Flash .
I know for a fact that people visit my webpage. But the fact that is unknown is why people that visit do not sign  urlLink the guestbook . I know who you are, I have my ways of keeping track of stats. But just  urlLink sign  the fucking thing. damn it!
The Sad Guys Wish    My pal  urlLink Omar  wrote and illustrated a short story titled  urlLink The Sad Guys Wish . It's a really neat short story about a sad guy and his wish. It also has some very cool cameos in it. Omar is 16 and lives in Irvine, California. For more information about him, visit  urlLink www.omargazi.com . As far as I know, Omar is still alive dispite what his web site might lead you to believe.  Also I wou'd like to take this time to say that  urlLink blogger  is a piece of crap and that I f
