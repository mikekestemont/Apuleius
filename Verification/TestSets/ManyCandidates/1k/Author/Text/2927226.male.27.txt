OK, so turning 27 was no big deal. What made the B-day a little more fun was having my housemate, Joe, celebrate his 26th just two days later (Thursday). Still, I think I'm gonna start a new tradition... I'm gonna start taking off work on my birthday so I can enjoy the day however  I  want -- whether it's sleep in 'til noon or assemble a scrapbook or drive to Philly for a cheesesteak.  In my mind, birthdays should be special in the way you want them to be.... if you want to work and ignore them, fine. But if you want to have the day to yourself, more power to you.
urlLink From the pages of the Delaware State News....   Uh, yeah. This is the fun stuff I get to write about.... seriously! How could you not laugh after reading this? I had a good chuckle with the state police spokesman, picturing some good ol' boy pulling up in front of the police station and walking inside and proclaiming, "I've got a car full of hand grenades. Who wants 'em?"   What a dummy. Who sits there and collects 32 hand grenades and then drives them to the police??? Um hello? 911, can I frickin' help you? Had one of the live grenades gone off and this guy had died, I'd have the winner for the 2004 Darwin Awards locked up already. But alas, this idiot probably went home and procreated.   Shit.
Welcome to my latest creation.... my very own Blog! I plan to post several musings on my favorite subjects -- baseball, music, wrestling and life in general -- as well as an account of my career as a reporter. Believe me, some interesting things happen in my office and on my beat.  And so,  on with the show!
Two words:  Dover Downs .  Those words mean nothing to you unless you: A) Like to lose money to one-armed bandits, or B) L-O-V-E NASCAR. The Downs is part casino, part hotel, part international speedway. Two major NASCAR races are hosted here each year, which draws 150,000 rednecks and thousands of RVs to Dover (and thus lowering the IQ of the state by 30 points) and rakes in about $95 million in revenue for associated businesses. While I HATE NASCAR with a passion, I have to respect the fact that I live in a town that actually has a guaranteed tourist draw outside of its history.  As for the casino, it's just video slots, but who knows? I might strike it rich someday! :-P Either way, Dover Downs is contributing to society (albeit by producing more broke, drunk rednecks, but you've gotta start somewhere).
urlLink A perfect example of why I can't live in a town right out of "Deliverance"   So, two candidates for Frederica Town Council are running for office with the understanding that if they are elected, they could nix the town's two-officer police force -- a violation of the town's charter. Great idea! Why don't we turn off the water and reinstitute a central well for the town? And bring back the town crier!  "Stupidity" doesn't begin to describe this pair. I'm certainly curious to see if they get elected, which would prove my theory about elections -- the idiots always outnumber the educated.  Even better than their campaign platform is the hand-written flyer they apparently are circulating around town, which reads, "We stand for honesty,  integrator , and with the support  from  the community. We want to make a  different  for the town."  I might make mistakes when writing, but if you're going to hand out flyers while running for mayor (even if it is a hamlet of 650 in the middle of Podunk), you might want to double-check the spelling first. *sigh* Now how do I follow that up with a "Why I like living in Dover" post? :-/
Welcome back to Delaware Revisionist History 101. I'm your unbelievably young professor, Dr. Drew. :)  Today we take a break from 300-year-old history... I simply don't want to put you to sleep!  Why is Dover cool and unique? We have  Dover Air Force Base , a major military installation in the US. How important is it? Well, during WWII, Hitler had two targets circled on his map of the US: 1) Washington DC (duh) and 2) Dover Air Force Base. The base is a major cargo transport base, shipping military supplies to all over the world via the C-5 Galaxy, the largest plane in the US Air Force. The damn thing's cargo bay is one foot longer than the Wright Brothers' entire first flight!  Also, Dover AFB is home to the only port mortuary in the US. When soldiers die in action (Vietnam, Iraq, the Pentagon victims from Sept. 11), their remains come here for identification and preparation for a military burial. It was a pretty chilling moment on Sept. 12, 2001, when you could hear and then see Chinook helicopters flying right over your head toward the base, and you knew what was inside.
The joke has been out there for a while now, especially among my friends who have (briefly) visited Dover -- Why would you live in a town like Dover? What the hell possessed you to move to the boonies instead of a blossoming metropolis?  Well, let me try to respond in a series of posts.   First, let me offer a  point  before I go into my  counterpoint .... Dover  is  a semi-boring town. There is almost nothing for anyone between the ages of 21-35 on a regular basis -- no concerts, no real nightclubs, not even a real coffee shop to veg out in. The stores in downtown Dover close at 6pm on weeknights and before 5pm on weekends. For a city with two legitimate undergrad colleges, there is very little for students to do, and even less for poor 20-somethings to find. Hence the reason I venture to Newark or take to the roads on weekends.  However, Dover is interesting if nothing else because it is the state capital. It's a 300-year-old city (once you get p
