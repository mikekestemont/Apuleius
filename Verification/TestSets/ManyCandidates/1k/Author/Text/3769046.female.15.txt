movie:  I shall not bore you people to death w/ the morning crap. On to the movies. Saw people. Took long on choosing what movie to watch. Altho the original plan was to watch 'a cinderella story.' But resulted into four people watching 'the notebook.' And the rest (12) watched 'a cinderella story.' First went to the washroom. Thus making us a little late to the movie. Was dark. Freakin' person scared me. But at least he hurt himself in the process, hah. So went in. Somehow ended up in a retarded position. But then someone took someone's spot. So I guess it was pretty okay. So previews for some movies. Tennis. We started talking about tennis, and how we suck so badly. Hahaha. Then yu-gi-oh. Woohoo, we're gonna watch yu-gi-oh in august! What fun. Then more previews and talking about weird things. I think we talk too much w/ each other. Seriously, I think we do. Bleh.&nbsp;So movie started. Saw castle, started talking about housing, hah. Then more talking. Movie was pretty okay. Felt a little claustrophobic at times. He kept nudging. But it was okay. Just laughed a lot. I was pretty content where I sat. Two fun people to be w/.&nbsp;Lmao, laughed at such retarded parts. Called so many people ugly in the movie, that was crazy and fun.&nbsp;    after movie:  &nbsp;Went to the arcade place. Got in trouble, wasn't our fault. Hah.&nbsp;So yeah. Waited for the people watching 'the notebook.' Took hella long. But finally&nbsp;we were all re-united..*rolls eyes* So divided ourselves into four teams. Bowling was okay. Dunno if I ever would go bowling&nbsp;again. Hah. So time passed quickly. Was a&nbsp;little too close to me. My god, this summer. A little too freakin' close to me!   after bowling: &nbsp;Then went&nbsp;back to silvercity. Saw my aunt. Some two people were discussing about their movies. My god, I bet she hates me for interrupting them. I don't know if she's still denying that she likes him, 'cuz it's so obvious. My goodness. So many people these days are in denial. Quite sad actually. So some people stayed and watched 'dodgeball.' And others went to richmond center. But first we went to subway. Then got on t
