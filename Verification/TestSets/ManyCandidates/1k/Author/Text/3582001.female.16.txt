I wanna slit your throat and fuck the wound.  Wanna push my face in and feel the swoon.  Wanna dig inside, find a little bit of me.  'Cause the line gets crossed when you don't come clean.   My wormwood meets your pesticide.  You'll never get out, 'cause you were never alive.  I am infinite, I am the infant finite.  Come a little closer and I'll show you why.  (NO ONE IS - SAFE)  Noises, noises, people make noises,  people make noises when they're sick.  Nothing to do except hold on to NOTHING!   (NO ONE IS - SAFE)  Noises, noises, people make noises,  people make noises when they're sick.  Nothing to do except hold on to NOTHING!   How does it feel to be locked inside another dream  That never had a chance of being realized?  What the fuck are you lookin' at?  I'll tell you what you're lookin' at!  Everyone you ever fuckin' laughed at!   Look in my eyes for the answers - typical.  I can feel it underneath like a miracle.  Everybody in the world needs more than  Lies and consequences to power them. Once again, it's me and no one else.  I can't remember if there was a someone else.  It's not mine, it's not fair, it's outta my hands,  And it's shaking - you'll never take me!   (NO ONE IS - SAFE)  Noises, noises, people make noises,  People make noises when they're sick.

(BITTER) Bitter as the stink of when I try.  I'm not supposed to be here...  I'm not supposed to be...   Pull your hands away.  I'm gone - goodbye - it's so depressing.  Withering away...  Take a look - inside - my soul is missing.  All I have is dead, so I'll take you with me.  I feel like I'm erased - so kill me just in case.  I FEEL LIKE I'M ERASED - SO KILL ME JUST IN CASE.  Don't kill me, drop the gun!  (COVET) Everything around me's mine.  (STY) Can't see through the sties in my eyes.  I'm not supposed to be here...  I'm not supposed to be...   (DOWN) Scratching and clawing all the way.  (STAY) You won't let me fucking stay.  I'm not supposed to be here...  I'm not supposed to be...   (LIVE) Is there another way to live?

Okay, you say I'm a liar. You and I are the only ones that know that's a cover-up right now. Because you know the truth. Well, I must admit that I did promise you I wouldn't tell her, or anyone for that matter. So maybe that was a lie, or just a broken promise. Meh, it happens. But you lied to me when you told me that you told her, and you lied to her when you told her that it wasn't true after I told her the TRUTH. So now she thinks that I am the liar. But you know the truth. And the truth is that it happened. She said she'd forgive you. So why don't you just make it easier for both of us and let it be known. It happened, so just live with it.
Yeah... I saw my therapist, Sandee, yesterday. I talked to her alot since I hadn't seen her in about a month. I told her about failing Government and breaking up with Josh, my problems with Jake and his problems with Kari. I got a lot of things figured out. I love Sandee. So then, I had Marching Band practice yesterday night. From 6:30 to 9 o'clock. Gee, that was fun. Marching around the Gymnasium floor, forward and backward, breaking to check my sections posture occasionally. Great stuff. Jake said not a word to me, and if that's the way he's gonna be, he might get himself into a little bit of trouble, or I might be okay with it. We'll see. And then tonight, I had music practice from 6 o'clock to 8 o'clock. I GOT MY SHOW MUSIC! Yay. Yeah, Kari's a little sneak and got it before the rest of us. (Sorry Kari, I love you). But yeah...I have a concert in the Park next Thursday. That oughta be great fun. Ha! Well, Jake did say he wanted to call me on like Tuesday...so he would have called me Wednesday, but I received no such call. Maybe because my phone line was cut by the Jokinens, who are building a barn across the street from my house, and I didn't have a phone for half of the day. Could be it. And hey, guess what, guys? I might go into the NAVY! Woo-hoo! That'll be fun. Anyway...I g2g.
