Well, just finished attending my dear university's annual political theory conference.  They are always set up as "Must Political Theory Be ______".  This year, the blank was filled with "Secular."  Before getting into it, I should mention that these are definitely meetings for theorists.  As my dear heart calls them, these are "naval-gazing conferences."  And we gaze very well, or at least very deeply, if poorly.  So, this year was on secularism.  Three guest speakers are brought in each year, to provide their input on the question.  Usually, they try and arrange this as a matter of one person saying "yes," another "no," and another somewhere in-between.  This year did not quite turn out that way.  Instead, the answers were, "yes, more-or-less," "yes," and "HELL YES."  So, needless to say, those of us who are not secular-minded (like myself, the reincarnation of an old-line Dominican; and then my good friend, the ardent Calvinist) were a bit on the defense this time about.  It was illuminating, but not really in a positive way.  Contemporary political theory has a problem - the academics assume that they can assume quite a bit away.  As even one prof pointed out, apparently at their home universities, they generally don't have to face questions from folks who are hard-core religious believers, especially from those who aren't a little to the Left of Ted Kennedy.  So, when all is said and done, we find out that political theory must be secular because religion depends on faith statements and revelation, things that not everyone (in a plural society) will agree with.  Fine, great, good.  But, then, these folks are very interested in equality, freedom, liberty, etc., etc.  So, you ask them, "What is the basis for these ideas?"  The answer - a moral intuition.  Yeah.  Now, I am not the best student on earth, but I wager I would remember the day in Normative Political Theory class when we covered the Vulcan mind-meld that allows us access to each other's moral intuitions.  But, somehow, while we can't all agree on faith matters (obviously), somehow we can agree on moral intuitions.  That we can't access.  And that no one agrees on.  The key difference, I guess, between divine intuition and moral intuition is the former uses the dread "G" name, while the other doesn't. (sigh)  Oh, well.  Off to the reception now, where we eat, drink, talk, drink, be merry, and drink.
Bleem.  Perhaps you have not heard of the term.  It comes from Conan O'Brien's "In the Year 2000."  It refers to a new emotion, a "type of happy anger."  It sounds contradictory, and yet, I have experienced bleem myself.  Where?  Why, on the Internet, of course.  Bleem perfectly typifies the feeling you get delving into the yahoo message boards.  There are all types of idiocy on them, but these various fools have one thing in common - an uncritical self-confidence, or, in other words, an ego so large that planets are shifting their orbits.  One gets bleem from interacting with these types because 1.) they tick you off, and 2.) you derive great pleasure from showing any with eyes to see the sheer nit-wittery of your opponents.  Naturally, though, one must be cautious about partaking in bleem.  After all, how many of those fools on-line started out as bleem addicts, too?  That, and you can kill far too much time on trying to make your case, especially with some of the....unique argumentative rules used in these boards.  One even told me that, in his way of thinking, he does not require rationality even of his own thoughts.  Ooooooh, bleem, bleem everywhere!  This was all rather random.  Much more to talk about, but little time (grant deadlines staring me down, and I'm starting to flinch).  Bleem.  Bleem bleem bleem.
Some old high school buddies of mine made a listserv for us all, and one of my friends shared a dream she had, asking if anyone wanted to take a crack at analyzing it.  So, I figure what the heck, I'll do my best impersonations of Freud[sex freak] and Jung[complex], and see what happens.  I am very pleased to say that another friend on the list, a grad student in social psychology, said my Jung was "right on."  Yes yes, if this whole political theory thing doesn't work out, I can always spend my life delving into minds and the collective unconscious.  A guy in the department a couple weeks back said I should be a psychologist - a nice thought, but after hearing that their suicide rate was rather high, I decided against.  All in all, though, I cannot do better than yet another friend on the list, our friend Mo, who summed it up best: "Everybody have fun tonight!  Everybody cite Jung tonight."
Generally speaking, when folks think of my dear university, Texas A&M University, they consider it to be a rather conservative (if not hick redneck) sort of place.  As of late, we have had so much "diversity" propaganda shoved up our respective whazoos to make me question Aggieland's stereotype.  So low and behold, what should I see on the front page of our dear student newspaper, the Battalion?  We apparently had ourselves a bit of a rally Friday.  Furious that our malcontent commissioners would not follow the humble San Francisco tradition of magistrates breaking the law, about 50 people organized to protest outside the courthouse for same-sex marriage licenses in a rally called, I kid you not, "First comes love, then comes marriage."  Allow me a cynical, snobbish, cheap shot - can one really take seriously a protest that gets its name from a schoolyard rhyme?  What next?  An anti-hate speech rally called "I'm made of rubber, you're made of glue"?  A diversity protest called, "Red Rover, Red Rover"?  A frat boy grass-roots movement against puritanical fashions on women called "I see London, I see France"?  [my inner frat boy who never was cries out "sign me up!"  I hate that guy....he's the same one who leaves his dirty socks around my mind]  But, I guess time to g
