Alright kiddies, I have a bottle of champagne in me right now, so I thought it would be interesting to see what happens here. The thing with this blog is that it is written "cold" in that I don't write rough drafts - I write what I think, as I think it - this should be interesting, or at the very least - depressingly amusing.  I'm watching the fourth season of The Simpsons right now - the series is even more surreal. I really want to jack off right now. I feel like stripping off my clothes ans pounding it right now. I'm laughing at even the most trifle of Simpsons jokes.   If you've been high on Mary Jane, you may have experienced sensory deprivation. My fingers are asleep. Oh no, the series just said something serious, and I laughed. I prefer not watching the screen, I like listening to the voices right now. Maybe I can create a song based on sound bites.  I never realized how still the series was - or maybe thats because I can't care right now - although I am trying to correct my abysmal spelling - its never been my strong point.  "Cloud goes up, cloud goes down."  I can't feel my face.  or my fingers - which you know - or my palms, which you didn't.  The bottle of champagne is nifty - its from Spain, and has metal on the bottle. The taste is dry and not that bad, thou I adore Veuve Cliquot or "J" - both are quite tasty.   My arms are not numb - tingly describes it. I want something to snack on. OOOh, pretzles, hang on.  I am wobbling when I walk, but I dropped my keyboard, I'm trying to keep at least cohearant whilst typing, but my entire body is numb - but happy feeling.  My neck is like a noodle.  Leaning back feels good. My thumb, hell all fingers hurt from typing - not too painful, but noticeable.  My neck no longer exhists, my head feels really good either against the shair, or my chin against my chest.  The room spins when I close my eyes - not on a horizonal axis, but a vertical one - I am instantly remined of a slot machine.  I think "Marge is ugly" I lagugh at my thought, and rest my head on the chair. My thumb - it hurts. Even scratching enhances my numbness, except in my fingers which - hurt.   I want to masturbate, my thumb hurts - its the episode where Springfirled gets a monorail. The pretzels aren't making the best of their flavor - but I - ugh I don't know. Ow, my thumb.  Is that an astronaut on that street?  Closing my eyes feels really good.  Shut up grandpa.Um, the pretzels are drying my mouth, I should get water. My thumb. Yumm, C2. Monorail. Damn pretzelsl, like cement between my gums and lips. I want to keep my eyes closed. Monorail - pretzles, dry, chwing with laughs. Saiva - where are you? I'm trying to stay level headed - it doesn't seem to be working, When I laugh, I close my eyes and put my head against the chair. I want to get naked, hang on.  Yay, I'm naked, and numb. I just took a piss, and kept bobbing all around - and yet - I got every drop in the bowl. No more pretzels. Damn.   I usually watch Will and Grace when drunk, as Karen is a high end drunk and it makes the show that musch cooler - yeah. I can't pay attention to the screen. Seeing Krusty while drunk is frightening. "Farrah want out!" Actually, I'll want out if hung over, but I am not hung nor am I over. I'm going to get some water. Pretzles are still wedged in between my gums and teeth.   Usually when I drink a bottle of champagne - usually Veuve - I don't wobble and bob about so much, or maybe I do - I just haven't been concious of it, so I wanted to make an entry of it - I thought it would make for an enlightening experience. I'm gonna see what else I have to morsel upon. Nothing. I went to the city and so I'm bare in the cupboard and clothing industry.  I'm sitting, when I close my eyes, I feel like I'm rolling inside a tire - back first. It is now 2:02 acording to the clock in my bed room. I'll end here. Just know that I'll be masturbating and ten passing out. Nite.
The clouds were spread thin across the sky. Going towards the horizon, the clouds seemed to have been blended together, then dispersing to create a sight that never fails to make one sentimental - that sight being a beautiful sunset. I couldn't ask for a better "welcome home" than that sight. This happened on the train, going to Emeryville where I then take a bus to San Francisco.   I went into the city for pride weekend, but really don't want to talk about it. Not because I didn't enjoy myself - because I did. Maybe I'll come back to it, maybe I won't - but quite frankly, I'm a hell of a lot more interested recalling the relief I had felt in San Francisco. Quite honestly, San Francisco is my Tiffany's. While I'm not naive enough to think that nothing bad will happen to me there, I do feel a comfort there. It isn't the comatose comfort of familiarity, its a feeling that creates sensations in the body's nerves that lets one know that this isn't a case of "Araby" in that I am placing something on a pedistal that I know nothing of. This is a feeling of - well to put the seal on the Hallmark card - home.   Feelings like this can be attributed to the amazing times I've had in this city. It could be the friends and chosen family that reside there. It could be the fact that I a
