Bodgit only managed 37 tonight... Forgot that England beat Mexico on the way to winning the 1966 World Cup. We are never any good at golfers either. Didn't know that Everton has two elephants on their shirts next season either... Saw Steve and Karen from the Robin Hood who had turned up at the pub for their night off. They said that they were too busy for a Quiz Night. I suggested that they would have difficulty due to lack of space - because although they have more physical space, they've filled it up with big leather sofa's and food tables. Not that useful for lots of teams of 4 or 6 fighting over somewhere to sit! So looks like we're stuck with the Ridgeway! We had two goes at the safe tonight, drawing 2 of our 3 raffle tickets out! But neither Alan or myself managed to crack it! Another donation of our own Â£5 to the Bruge Christmas Fund then! Ho Hum...
Transport for London announced that cyclists in London were up 25% and remarkably cycling accidents were down by 8%. Not that I'm dubious about the second statistic...   Today was a first however - nearly being knocked over by a cyclist when I was on a zebra crossing coming the&nbsp;wrong way! &nbsp;I looked right to make sure no traffic was hurtling to fast towards me - all clear to get to the central island&nbsp;so I sallied forth - only to see a cyclist, coming from my left - on the wrong side of the road shave my eye brows. Head phones on&nbsp; and totally oblivious. Prat! Why was he on my side - because he didn't want to stop for the pedestrians crossing from the other side of the road as the rest of the traffic had done....  Licence cyclists and make 'em carry insurance - that's what I say!
Last night's Evening Standard was full of letters saying how happy they had taken the plunge and moved out of London.  London is scruffy, noisy, rude and expensive. Well today, London is bustling with that laid back sort of feel.  The Victoria Line was empty.  Kings Cross was flowing reasonably traffic wise. Grays Inn Road was empty (mind you it is still only one way at the moment...) Mecklenburgh Square had groups of people smiling and laughing and conversing - it was very nearly a Lionel Bart set. I expected strawberry sellers and a big brass band to come round the corner... London in the summer, without the school morning rush - heaven. Probably back to its crappy self tomorrow...
Anyone out there ultra pigged off that    There is a lot of crap on Channel 4 , but the best TV cop show is shown usually between the hours of midnight and one am in the morning?  We are now two seasons behind the States - a full 44 episodes!!!  There was no announcement by Channel 4 of when series 10 might appear on our screens - if ever   I think Sky should take things in hand and go for the rights for series 10 and 11.   They sorted out 24 when BBC shoved it on BBC 2 at late evening viewing. Lets get some proper people with programming sense to put the worlds best cop show into the limelight...  &nbsp;
Is it just me?? On Sunday, Chanderpaul had only just gone out to bat when he gloved a catch to a close fielder. Everyone thought it was out, except the umpire. The slo mo showed it clearly coming off the glove and it was an obvious catch, however the umpire didn't give it. During the analysis at the end of the game, all the pundits were discussing whether or not the umpire should get to see the replay before making his decision.   Actually, that is not the point....   Chanderpaul knew he had gloved it and should have walked - not waiting for the raised finger. By not walking, surely it would be deemed as cheating?...... This was never even discussed. Mind you Geoff Boycott was a pundit...   Professionalism is such a wonderful thing. Never did Maradona any harm I suppose..
The kid who played Jason ... I said to Linda, he's got the look of Alan Armstrong.   And what do you know, the cast list reveals....   Jason Murphy ...... Joe Armstrong   And Linda says I always say he looks like.... and it never looks like him....   I rest my case
Just created a blog at work, but obviously can't swear or rant about things too much - so am setting up one for everyday life - as I can never be bothered with all this uploading mularky on the Internet pages you get with your accounts.   So hopefully you'll be able to see life as it comes down in the smoke and grime of Lunnon taan.   So apologies to the girls in Fulham, as the Piccadilly line was up the creek at 6 when I left work - this is why I'm doing this blog instead.   We are also looking at how many syns a Muller Rice is and I'm definitely over the limit today.   Off to see if we can fathom out Waking The Dead this week - last week was a bit too much double Irish informant for me - was a bit confused in the end. The beard has got to go Shoestring.....
Been a strange week at work.   Lots of mundane stuff like sorting out this damn Athens Administrator Guide, which I'm still not really happy with, but it does have lots of screen dumps and hot tips, so I hope people understand it! Hopefully that will go out to the masses on Monday.  Great to have Cheryl back - it was quite funny having only just made it in to work on Monday, getting a phone call from Cheryl saying can you come and help me carry my bag in! The crutch is a little cumbersome - poor cock! Any way she's back into the swing, or half limp, with the team review. It is worrying, but a c
