&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In completing my position and research paper, I should be drawing on the work of other writers, this is the part when I must document their contributions. Which disciplines should I use?. APA or MLA?.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever it is I must make sure that I follow these 3 rules.   1.The sources is introduced by a signal phrase that names its author.  2.The material being cited is followed by a page number in parentheses.  3.At the end of the paper, a list of works cited gives complete publishing information about the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; source.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All those three rules are very useful, especially for my research paper...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I am concentrating on my introduction, I think it is important to establish my own voice in the introduction.My opening paragraphs should introduce me as a writer as well as my ideas to the reader.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One or two paragraphs are usually enough introduction for most paper in this course. I am sure, most readers do not want a great deal of background -&nbsp; they want to get right to the point.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am hoping that by stating the thesis and showing its importance, an introduction should hook readers.Or should I use a kind of&nbsp;strategies &nbsp;that to pose a puzzling problem to connect my topic to the reader.... all these my be taken into consideration in writing an introduction for position and research paper. I am working on it.....
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now,I am on the stage of drafting my position paper as well as my research paper...   With restricted thesis, a preliminary outline and plenty of notes, I am ready to write my first draft.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I am doing right now is to keep it rough and keep it moving. I do not let my wish for perfect sentences stall me at this stage.From the ideas and supporting details, I will polish my sentences later. By writing rapidly, I think it might produces a more natural,individual voice and helps to avoid echoing the language of my sources.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing for sure, a chatty, breezy voice is usually not welcome in this academic papers.  As though I believe in my main point and are interested in my subject, I will try to communicate that sense of conviction.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last semester, we were doing a proposal paper for Prof.Kay course.... she did mentioned about primary and secondary sources.According to Prof.Kay, primary source is more reliable than a secondary source because it has the advantage of being a firsthand account.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In carrying out the task given either in position or research paper, I have to read with a 'critical eye'.I have to&nbsp;examine the assumptions, assessing its evidence and weighing its conclusions.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ssometimes I came across some elements of argument and encounter experts who disagree with the sources I found. Here I have to read the sources arguments with special care and testing them with my own critical intelligence....now my note taking skills came in. In order to make life easier, I have to take notes as I read because it will help me to remember later as I am going to draft my position as well as my research paper.....
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am working on my research paper....In carrying out this task, time management plays a great role.I really need time to read... In searching of answers to a research question, I must read critically, meaning I have to process the information as well as assessing what I read.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With research questions in my mind, I seek the truth...How am I to seek the truth ?&nbsp;  Questioning poet's expertise?  Looking for possible flaws in the poet's reasoning?  Weighing the evidence?   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes,&nbsp;I facing problems with the internet sources.Is all clues that are provided in the articles are worth tracking down?. Some of them provide abstracts or brief summaries which I need to question myself in tracking down a source.Some of the questions are; How relevant are they to my research?&nbsp; How long is the source? A very short article may be too general to be helpful...&nbsp;&nbsp; How valid are they?   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right now, I Have tracked down some sources, now is the time to make a preview....  How hectic it is.....
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a saying..."No gain no pain". I agree with that phrase ....&nbsp; the&nbsp;path to success is full of thorn!!  In getting a right track to present my&nbsp; thesis statement as well as the topic sentence,&nbsp;I have to think deeply whether or not ut will come in as a complete package without lacking anything anywhere.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The introduction of my topic sentence was not good because it is not clearly focus on the sensory device that I'm going to talk about.... the feedback I got from my lecturer.After doing some reflection&nbsp;I think I can sharpen the focus by clarifying what type of sensory devices that I am going&nbsp; to present, for example'sound'.If I were to talk about this device I must talk about it in one or two sentence(s) before providing all the evidences with an elaboration of it.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I too must take into consideration whether the introduction focuses clearly on the main point of the essay. In doing this, two questions lingering in my mind...  1. Does my intro let reaaders know what to expect as they read on ?  2.Does it make the significance of the subject clear so that readers will want to read on ?   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope the rest of my position paper will fulfill the thesis statement need and accurately state the real point of the position paper.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I am thinking on how to state the main point in a topic sentence.......I know that a paragraph should be unified around a main point and the point should be clear to me first then goes to readers.&nbsp;According to Diana Hacker, "a good topic sentence is one sentence summary of the paragraph's main point, acts as a signpost pointing in two directions: backward toward the thesis&nbsp;of the essay and forward the body of the paragraph."  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By looking at her definition, it is quite difficult to make a g
