At long last the bus is about to leave. There's something awesome about Chinese people -- I just got kicked out of my nice spacious seat to spend the rest of the bus ride by people I don't know in the back entirely because of two elderly Asian ladies (Yeah, I couldn't really refuse...my mom and dad were in the next seat over and there's this whole "respect your elders" Asian culture thing). The tour guide just gave us an introduction in a heavy latino accent which I very much doubt anybody here understood, but at least they did make good use of the phrase "Thank you", which is perhaps the only shred of English they know. I love America.
It's been a long time since I've had the pleasure of being called a chink. I've been called many things in the South -- a kid even came up to me once, clasped his hands together solemnly, bowed slightly and said "how". Apparently the racial separation between Native Americans and the Asiatic peoples is less distinct than I thought. Anyway, I went down into the lobby of our splendid Super 8 motel to get some watery coffee with my mom and dad. We went outside, wandered to a nearby convenience store, sipping coffee and feeling the hot wind blow across our faces. A truck came by, big bass beating. "Chink!" Some muscular guy in a wifebeater shirt shouted at us. The truck had about 5 people in it -- a blonde girl excited by the lights, sounds, and sights and a couple of guys in the back laughing uproariously at the wifebeater's clever and witty use of rhetoric. IT really is the end of the line when your only excitement is driving around drunk in Idaho, shouting chink at passing Asian tourists. I half considered taking a picture but decided against it, realizing that the wifebeater could easily tear my limb from limb and very likely had the inclination to do so out of sheer spite.   On a separate note, I had a nice chat over the phone with one of the former Magnet Elite. Like me, he also moved shortly after Freshman year. It's really really cool to meet someone who has gone through the same struggles you have with moving, adjusting to alien cultures, eating ramen with ice cream, discovering the use of asyndeton, etc. I gotta stop writing before I get all choked up...
I'm not one to flout my (lack of) manliness, but I did just eat a bear. In soup form. It tasted like mushroom soup, and by the time I got to it, there were only microscopic bear particles left, but notwithstanding embellishing things is always fun. "And it was this big  ". Yup. I even had to fight it mano a ma..eek! A SPIDER!
We're in Idaho now. Nothing that great to see, but there was this trucker lady in the truck stop taht gave me ice cream (This is actually serious, guys!) I dunno if I've been tainted with ideas of nice truck stop people from Grapes of Wrath, but there was something quiet and stoic about the lady that just made me pause as she scooped up ice cream fo rme. She is like the mountins here...a bit large, somewhat formidible, probably here for years upon years, working tis lonely truck stop serving truckers thier black coffee and tourists their ice cream. THere was something about the lady that just really did make me feel like a little farmerboy. I'm 17 yeasr old, but I really don't know anything about anything that really matters. When she gave me my ice cream, I said "Thank you m'am." She kinda smiled.

My dad woke me up at the ungodly hour of 3:30 AM, when the sleep gnomes still reign over th night and traffic lights change as soon as you drive by trhem. Things were pretty uneventful until I reached the security check at the airport -- I put my Rubik's Cube in the little tray, and after I passed through the X-ray machine on the other side, I saw one of the security guards cubing with a passion. Schweet!
It's Friday, and I just realized that tomorrow, I'm going off to a fun filled week to various parts of the Western US. Of import are Salt Lake City, spawning ground of Mormons, SCO, and Orrin Hatch (all of whom I despise with a passion), Yellowstone (outdoors), and South Dakota (somewhat smelly according to the Simpsons). Although it seems as if I'm very reluctant to go on this trip, I'm actually quite excited. Originally, I thought that I would have to spend hours outdoors, communing with nature to the point where I would be able to understand why earthquakes were slowly breaking apart Northrend, but instead, I get to meet the enemy (trees, everything in Utah, Holiday Inn) FACE TO FACE. So, for the ones of readers out there, don't despair! I'll be back in a week, probably with a rapid flurry of posts and/or pictures. Tally ho!
As a firm democrat who is generally opposed to the Governator in general (well, with the exception of  urlLink his ridiculous ownage of opponents ) , it was a pleasant surprise to see that he's got some things going right. That's right folks, California is considering Open Source! Although the proposal for Open Source comes primarily out of a desperate need for money, it's a good first step that may someday challenge the Microsoft Hegemony. Of course, I'm not one to mention irony of the Governator trying to destroy the mindless, robotic killers driven by Sky...err Dot Net...  One has to wonder though: What will happen to Microsoft if it someday loses power? With 50 billion dollars in reserve, how can Microsoft even fall? An image of Bill Gates springs into my mind, resting peacefully in his office when suddenly a bright red light starts flashing, sirens blare, and Gates makes the call to Ballmer to press that magical r
