I got to the guest house - where I am staying - it was a long day at work and I was looking forward to a night of rest...  that, not counting on the fact that my Swedish friend - who also lives at the guest house - was waiting for me, all dressed up in her Swedish colors ready to go out to watch the Sweden - Denmark Euro 2004 soccer game... Big game for Sweden as they would qualify to the Quarter finals if they draw or win.  I stated that I will stay home and watch it here... but she said I should join her as they are going to the American Colony (A hotel/bar in Jerusalem) to watch the game - big group she said... and that her good friend Vanunu will be there! Vanunu is the renowned Israeli nuclear scientist that was in prison in Israel for 18 years 10 in total solitude confinement!   Naturally I changed my mind and I decided to go - looking forward to meeting the man... and shaking his hand.  In the American colony the Atmosphere was jolly, Danish in Red, Swedish in Yellow and blue... both cheering loudly for their team... all drinking heavily ($6 Us dollars for a tap beer!) their is so much money in this town.  Any the game ended 2-2 which meant both Denmark and Sweden made it to the quarter finals on the account of Italy missing out. So both the Danish & Swedish gangs were happy... I was too....but I was slightly disappointed for missing out on meeting Vanunu... he didn't show up... too much noise I guess - can't blame the man... the closest I got was meeting his brother.
Today on my way to Ramallah I was reading a beautiful poem from Rubaiyat that goes like this:  Awake! For morning in the bowl of night Has flung the stone that puts the stars to flight: And lo! The hunter of the East has caught The Sultan’s Turret in a Noose of Light  As I was reading this to my friend while she’s driving us through a check point … I left my head up and saw Soldiers and the wall… so far from what I was reading that I decided to write a lil poem:  'Once upon a wall'  Once there was a wall Once I danced in the rain Once I loved              … under a full moon Call me crazy – if you want              … a ‘majnoon’ Who dances when love is not              …When walls are put Who dances when passion is not              … When soldiers rule Call me romantic – if you wish              … call me a fool Once I danced              … to gypsy music              … to waves… and a river              … to love… passion              … once I danced forever Today another wall is built              … made of blood              … mesh              … and cement Once we will dance              … with no wall              … hate              … just a the moon              … and a jasmine’s scent  Now I am in the office contemplating... why... am i here... we are here...?  I sip my turkish coffee ... and write one more line on this blog... life goes on.
On Sunday i went to Taybeh... taybeh is a small village 20 minutes from Ramallah and Jerusalem... situated high on the mountains so you can see Jerico and Jerusalem in the distant... very beautiful village... and unique in being inhibited only by christians... and have the only beer brewery in Palestine... Taybeh beer... go to any Israelui bar and you can buy it.  So my family comes from there... and we still have a house that my father grew up in as a child before immigrating to Sweden... currently one of my uncles lives there - my only relative living in Taybeh...  So i arrived their for lunch... but before lunch i went to the church which happens to be next door to our house in Taybeh... it is said that my grandfather was there every sigle sunday... his entire life! His seat left unused till today...  After a huge huge lunch... i felt that the heat, the food and the breez... and my uncle's boring stories... required me to retire for a siesta and some reading... so i asked my uncle if he had any books i can read... he said he doesn't read much but pointed me to an attich with a book shelve... and to my delight and total surprise i find... lots of old yellowish books from the 30s and 40s... some in elglisg ... some in arabic... i even found a magazine from the 40s with coloured ads in arabic! but what attracted my attention was a poetry book half torn... with the first page a poem for Gibran Khalil... so i picked up and went to the guest room...  Are you ready for this? well, i found among it's pages... writings.. not just any writings.... but my dad's ... in fact his signature... in many styles... looks like it was my dad's whn he was 10- 12 years old... wanting to create a signature... there was also comments on the poetry... wow... how amazing is it when a book finds you...  So all the way to Jerusalem i was holding tight to my bag... worried about my torn yellowish poetry book... espicially going throu check points... if i had common sense i would have known that soldures are not really interested in books... not while they on duty anyways.
