Iâ€™m not going to post the results this time as it's getting way too depressing. But here is a brief rundown of what happened in week 2.   Game1  This was a really good start, and we all thought this might be it. We were holding them off and had a couple of half decent chances. But we let in a couple of silly and didn't manage to turn any chances into goals.   Game 2  We decided to try a different strategy this game. The 1-2-1 line up was used with a static defence and covering midfield with a loan striker hopefully slotting in goal after goal. We looked dangerous in places but possibly weren't quick enough at covering and ended the game a few goals down with none in our favour.   Game 3  We got whipped by one of the top teams, but didn't concede as many goals as one of the other teams that night (ll) but I have managed to block how many we did let in and it will never be written by my hand. We again scored NO goals, getting to be a bit of a habit that.  More work is still needed but i still think we will make a good team. We still have some great players and there are new ones turning up every week.
Lads, we need uniforms (British translation = kit) if we seriously want to compete. I'll put in the order for the team. Hopefully they'll be ready for our next game.
First thing is first. A big thank you to everyone that made it last night, we had a squad of 8, which is exactly what we need every week to give us options and rest tired legs when needed (and did we need resting ;). So again a big thanks to the first squad;   	 Robert Spicer  	 Ben Casey  	 Nick Clement  	 Ben Hutchins  	 Martin Lee  	 Stuart Wakeman  	 Tony Susi  	 Rob Smiley    Now for the bad news. To follow are the results and a quick run down of how our first games went;  Game 1  RR 0 - Edwin Coe 3  Our first outing was always going to be tough, we never played as a team and only half the team new each other (a few more beers and we might get there). Because of our lack of experience we didn't really have any structure or play as a team. Good effort by all, but we just weren't organised yet. A big shout has to go out to Ben Casey, who is our first casualty and was carted off with a buggered ankle after a good effort in defence, let's hope he's all fit and well next week.  Game 2  RR 0 - LCL Revolution 4  These guys were 2nd top after the first week so we new it was gonna be tough. We put in a valiant performance and played much better as a unit and caused them some real trouble in the first 5 minutes. Holding them off and creating some half decent chances. We let in a couple of silly goals and ended the game a respectable (for our second game) 2 goals down.  Game 3  RR 0 - BOB 5  Just above us in the league this was effectively a six pointer so it would have been great to win this one but allas it is possibly still too early to expect a victory. We continued our form from the second game and put in a real effort and managed keep men marked and find space when we had play. Again a couple of silly chance and they got the lead on us. But we learnt a lot and made some real progress. But shock of shocks we scored a GOAL, woohoo I hear you cry, but a quick look at the score line will have you back in your seat and wipe the smile off you face, Nick, in an attempt at a defensive block scored a corker in the bottom right hand corner of our own goal.  All in all a learning experience and a good run out for our first attempt playing together. We were always going to struggle at first, a lot of these teams have been playing together for ages. It might take a few weeks to gel but I reckon we have the players to cause some real havok over the next few weeks.
Remember lads, the ball goes here.
RR 1 - Kevin Costner 2 RR 1 - Cranium Cats 4 RR 0 - Booze Cruzerios 4  We had a team of only five again this week so the first thing is a huge thanks to all that turned up this week.  First game was a positive start and we looked like we were capable of so much more and I think we scared 7th place Costner who thought it was an easy fixture against the bottom team. Nice effort by Spicer, who got our only goal and a great job by Kev in defense.  Cranium Cats are 2nd in the league and deserve to be there. The strategy that worked so well last week and in this weeks first game let us down here, our modular approach was too transparent for these guys and once they found the back of the net they were all over us like a rash. Still if you look back to earlier in the league we might well have lost 7,8,8 or even 10 nil against a side like this so there has been improvement. Spicer again scored the token goal.  The game against Cranium kind of knocked the stuffing out of us a bit and affected the teams moral in this game. We just weren't in it to win it, and the score line showed it. We had no spark and let a few silly goals in. On a better day we may have given them a run for there money.
