That song was played through our cart today lol, as well as a good amountitude of patriotage buuuddy.   I have yet to eat or drink today so I am on a second wind and sort of hyper. I woke up with an attitude that reminded me of my english teacher this morning.  "I do not know how much I could ever trust a thing that bleeds nearly immensely for several days straight and does not die..." -James Francoeur in regards to females...yes...my english teacher said this to our class. I do not know where he got it from, but it came to mind and got me to laugh a bit this morning.  Now that you are a bit freaked out...the parades went well and once more Engineer Dave teased me about being the only female. The candy cannon worked well too. It allowed us to demonstrate that there are two different forms of "Ah"  There is the one which is amazed, such as: Ohhh, Ahhh, look at the fireworks!  And there is one which is terrified, such as: AH!!! HOLY SHIT WHAT WAS THAT?!?!?!?!  Both were heard today. About three people got hit in the head by candy. We started saying "Heads up" and all people would do was look up just to get konked. Or they would be like, "Why heads up?"   clunk  , "Oh."  No rain! Beautiful day...a bit buggy though.   lol, we had to use my dad's truck battery in our cart...sucker...lol.   Nah, just messing. It was a lot of fun today.  Daaang, I need to clean.  Have a good day!  -J9
Today: I shopped with my mom and she ended up getting a few shirts. I, myself, decided to save myself some dignity and did not look for shorts or anything or that sort and bought two shirts -green and white-, along with a belt that includes buttons of Einstein, a robot, and one that says "COFFEE NOW" lol. Perfect for Battlecry.   Then, stopped in to wish my brother well in his new home in Atlanta, Georgia with Laine (who was away working).  Nextly, went to see  The Day After Tomorrow . Definitely not what it is cracked up to be, trust me.  Following, played pool at A&G's to kill time before next movie. Please not that I did horribly. A few nice shots here and there, but that was all.  Lastly, went to see  Van Helsing . The parts I saw did not seem very spectacular but I do not wish to give much of an opinion as seeing that I slept through seriously 85%. However, I did see about 10%. The other 5%, I was outside the theatre in the lobby or on the phone lol. Greeeat.   Got home around 1:08AM after a quick pit stop at Dunkin Donuts.   Now, I am about to fall asleep here typing. Therefore, I am going to get something to drink, as seeing that I am terribly thirsty, and then go to sleep, as seeing that I have to wake up at 6:15AM in order to get to the high school for 7AM to load up stuff to get to Suffield a short time later to decorate the truck and march in that parade. Then, rush back to Windsor Locks and march again. Rain is expected, folks.   Good night  -J9
I will keep this short since I am probably going to update again tonight anyways. I'm wicked curious as to some sort of "good news" that I have been hearing all about. I hope that this person will give me a call at some point today when they have time.   Days plan: Shopping with the mother, BQ for my brother Josh who is moving to Atlanta with his girlfriend Laine, then I suspect nothing.  Last night I actually got to play pool. I have actually gotten better. Everytime someone left me with solids I did horribly for some reason. I always tried to sink the 15 ball first, and whenever I did, I seemed to have a better game. I am so weird lol.   Anyways, keeping it short...I hope you have a good day!    ::sunburn...ouch...at least I wore a hat yesterday...but my shoulders are killing me!::
I woke up this morning after having gone to bed at 5:30am at 7:15am to see the sun brightly shining and to hear news that it was to be a beautiful weekend. Since a train seemed out of the question, the canal was calling me.   I get dressed for it, pack a bag, and make a plan.  As I head out my stepmom was in a very sour mood. She went off on us and I decided to stay in and purge my anger on cleaning every square inch of my bedroom. That did not last long. I could not tolerate being here. So instead, I set off on my walk. As I went on my way I decided that since I got and hour and 45 minutes worth of sleep and had nothing to eat or drink, that I should probably get something. On my way, the stepmom catches up and apologizes so we are all good again. Lunch, la ti da, canal. Walked it. Saw a lot of wildlife:  Cardinals, blue jays, pigeons, snakes, turtles, fishies, ducks, butterflies, dragonflies, people...lol  I was being dumb and decided to poke the snake with a stick. It did nothing so "Hmmm, maybe it is dead," thinks J9...   ::poke::   J9 discovered the snake was, in fact, NOT DEAD. How one may ask? It becomes fairly apparent after it lashes out at you. Yeah, go J9...you are a winner...lol  One of the two highlights of the walk was talking to a very amiable older gentleman who had spent a good amount of time on the canal. According to him (his name is Dick, by the way), I am very serious about my walking lol.   The second, was laying down underneath the train bridge. I waited for the train that I could have potentially been on to pass directly overhead and then stared at the water. I saw a f
