Going away tomorrow (oh, aren't holidays fantastic...), so the poor blog will be neglected all week, unless I can be arsed to find somewhere to get online, which isn't likely.  Bye for now, Daniel
Fucking bastard fucking throat, it's driving me mad - I think it's the nasal decongestants, so I'll stop taking them for a while. Right now though, I want to physically rip out my throat (is that possible?) in order to end the irritation.  Heh, it reminds me of the episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm when Larry had a pubic hair stuck in his throat. (I don't have that though)  I am now officially obsessed with the Olympics, although I'm going away on Saturday so will probably miss most of the second week, which is fucking criminal. I've changed my mind about loving all Chinese people after they beat us in the Badminton thing, but I still love the main Chinese person (he's just so clever).  Oh my God, I have to write down my dream - it won't make sense to anyone reading it, but I like to record the best dreams that I have, and this is as good a place as any to do it.  My family did  something  to our house (I'm not sure what, but it basically resulted in us having an entirely different, and much bigger and better, house) and so for some reason we took in loads of lodgers. There was an American woman whose name I've forgotten, another woman called Patty, a man called Brian, this really cool psychologist woman who I love called Jenni Trent-Hughes, I think there might have been a couple but I'm not sure, and my two aunties on my mum's side. Also, Coventry was somehow by the sea, so the American woman was asking me lots of questions about the sea, such as how deep is it, and do I like to swim in it (I was getting quite annoyed with her). Ooh, and also I was auditioning to be on a quiz show, and for some reason this involved me having to fight an enormous monster, which I managed to kill just before it killed me. For the second audition I wanted to wear a shirt which I couldn't find, my mum had hidden it somewhere and I couldn't find it, and when I was looking for it I woke up and realised that I don't live by the sea, I don't have a huge house, I don't live with a load of cool other people, and I have no chance of appearing on a quiz show in the near future. I was so pissed off.  Daniel  P.S Oh yeah I got my AS Maths result which was a C, and as I was expecting a U, that was pretty cool.
Oops, forgot to do this yesterday - you might think that that would mean that this one will be twice as good as normal, but somehow I doubt it.  Today I "practiced" "singing" (yep, they're both in inverted commas because it probably wasn't real practicing and it definitely wasn't real singing) with the aid of a really sad book, which you too can purchase at  urlLink http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/184442880X/qid=1092866238/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i3_xgl/202-1114015-6414214  ! Despite the optimistic title, I really can't sing, but "singing" along to the CD is pretty fun. I also got another book, but the CD for that one features a strange robot woman instead of the lovely David and Carrie, so I don't like that one. My favourite exercise is number 12. You have to sing:  You're wonderful, you're beautiful X 4  but the "you're wonderful" has to be really loud and the "you're beautiful" has to be really quiet, but they still have to sound the same, so you can't just shout and whisper.  God, I'm sorry, I just realised how incredibly boring and sad that last bit was. Who the fuck cares what my favourite singing exercise is?  Daniel  P.S. I also like the one where you practice riffing.
Aw I love the tennis so much...Venus Williams and Chanda Rubin are playing some Chinese people, and they lost the first set 7-6 but now they're winning the second set 4-1. I love all Chinese people (especially one), but I want the USA to win this one. Yeah, I'm still obsessed with it - I really should find something better to do, but it's just too much effort.  I think I'm becoming slowly forced out of my own family - today they went out without even asking me if I wanted to go! OK, I always say no, and I would have said no today, but it's still nice to be asked. Right now I wish they'd leave me alone though, because my brother wants me to play penalty shoot outs with him (even though he cries and runs away if I score), and my dad is constantly kicking me off the computer and interrupting the tennis (that is a sin). It doesn't matter though, if I get forced out of this family I'll just go and live with my auntie who already has five kids - I'm sure she won't notice another one.  God, right now a load of cheesy American people are waving at the camera. I would go on a big rant and slag off American people, but just in case any American people ever read this, I'll just say that the majority of them really give me the creeps, although I'm sure lots of them are very nice (maybe).  My brother is here again - this time he wants me to play his new pirate game with him. I've already played it three times, and he beat me every time (which is rather humiliating), so I'm not that eager to play it again, especially as it's  shit . I always feel guilty for neglecting him though, so I'll probably end up playing the damn thing again in five minutes.  Yay Venus and Chanda won the second set! Sorry, I promise this will be the last time I mention the tennis in my b
