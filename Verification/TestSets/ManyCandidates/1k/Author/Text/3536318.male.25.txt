I find this  urlLink blog  randomly last night... Made me cry. ;)   I concur  As  urlLink Paul notes , we had a difficult meeting at church Sunday night. I was there partly because some friends talked us into seeing Shrek 2 with them, so we never made it home to Mebane in the afternoon, but also because I wanted to be there with Paul, since it involved him to some extent, and I was afraid it was going to get ugly. In my past experience, usually when something threatens to get ugly, even within a church congregation, it does. I was very pleasantly surprised. No one cast harsh or undue blame, and no one used the occasion to build him/herself up or to tear others down. I have to give a lot of credit to our pastors for setting the right tone and saying the right things, but also to the congregation (at least those who were present) for respecting the pastors enough to listen to them and recognize that they spoke the truth. I told Paul how surprised I was at the amicability of the whole evening and he said "That's why I love this church." And as much as I miss some of the liturgy and traditions of the Lutheran church, I've never seen a Lutheran congregation so serious about treating their brothers and sisters as God requires.

This surely is a sign of the apocalypse...  I'm getting a tan.
But in a good way.    All I can say is: What a weekend.  I realized the other day that within a week of arriving in Madrid, I found full time work, I got a part in a play, and I was meeting new people left and right.    Talk about jumping in the deep end.  I skipped 2nd, 3rd, and 4th gear and went straight to 5th.  120mph (19 meters).  And it all came to a flourishing climax within the last week.  My play started last weekend.  And it went wonderfully.  (Did you know that in Spain, they don't say 'Break a leg!'?  Instead, they say, "Mucha Mierda"  - A lot of shit. Hah. Those goobers.)  We gave 4 performances, all of which had a great turn out, even the matinee.  Afterwards, although I was extremely happy and grateful to have had the experience, I was also looking forward to all of the sleep I would finally be catching up on.  No more 7AM to 1AM days...     But, I wasn't off the hook that easy.  Most of my classes end on June 30th, so this week I was preparing practice exams, teaching an insane amount of hours in Intensive Courses, and whatnot.  So, by Friday afternoon, I was ready to finally let loose.    My roommate Kelly left for a 2 month visit back in the US on Saturday, and my other roommate, Juan, is moving out on the 30th, moving onwards to Barcelona.  And what does that mean?  One hell of a going away party for those silly bastards...  Unfortunately, by 9PM on Friday, the apartment was a mess, Juan was asleep in his room, Kelly had come down with Strep throat, and no party-supplies had been bought.  So, Kelly basically told me that the party was off.  :(  But there's always something to do in Madrid.  Always.  The director of my show, and my friend, Schuyler (Pronounced: Skippy), was acting in a few one acts in a small theater in Lavapies (Direct Translation: Wash Your Feet [I'm not lying either]) So I met up with a few friends, and we headed off to the theater.   Kelly and I have pretty much the same group of friends, very loquacious friends.  So it was no surprise to find myself approached by quite a few people after the show, asking about the party. And I was the lucky sap that got to tell them all that there would be no Fiesta-val in our apartment that night.  So we went out anyways.  We all headed out to a bar, stood around, drinking cañas, eating tapas, shooting the poo.  Once again, there's never a lack of things to do in Madrid, so it wasn't long before I heard news of other parties lurking in the hidden corners of the city.  Zoë, me, and some other friends decided to go to a Warehouse Birthday party in Sol.  (There are warehouses in the center of Madrid?)  But we decided not to leave for the party until around 1AM. (The party started at 11, but we all know that people don't start showing until 12.  And we wanted to be the fashionably late posse that paraded in at 1.)  So, we rushed to get to the "warehouse" by 1, because they only sent someone down every 1/2 and hour, to open the door for the newcomers.  It turned out that it was far from a warehouse, but more like a large office space that had been abandoned, and was taken over by a group of party crazed Spaniards armed with spraypaint.  It was good and all, but by 3AM, I was pretty pooped, so I headed back to Pappy's farm for some sleep.  And as I'm turning down my windy, cobble stoned, abandoned street, which I expect to be tranquil and serene at this hour, I can't help but notice the familiar sounds of House Techno Music blaring from some apartment.  And as I walk further down the hill, the music only gets louder and louder and louder.  So, as I turned the corner, and came into view of my apartment, it w
