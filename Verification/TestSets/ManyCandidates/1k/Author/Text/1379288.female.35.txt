She lost her user name, Karma1. Or rather, maybe someone stole it? So, now she is once again, oneandonly.   I did a search on that name, oneandonly, it's got about 55,000 links to dating services. I'm not kidding, try it for yourself.
jchallquist@excite.com  I got an IM from her, I didnt' even know she knew my yahoo name... Of course, she DOES search for me on a regular basis... Anyways, here it is. I blocked her, so I don't know if she sent more or what. She can't send my anything again unless she forms another NEW name...  Session Start (Yahoo! - JudyHallquist:scarpenter92020): Sun Nov 16 15:43:04 2003 scarpenter92020: lame very lame--trying to be me in sparc--desperate are we? dont worry, you'll be out of sparc in NO time JudyHallquist: what the hell are you talking about? JudyHallquist: bite my ass bitch *** scarpenter92020 has been ignored. JudyHallquist: you are a fucked up delusional bitch that should NOT be IM'n me...  I don't know what the hell your babbling on about but YOU need to stop this bullshit. DO NOT CONTACT ME. Session Close (scarpenter92020): Sun Nov 16 15:46:42 2003  So, now she's claiming that i'm trying to be HER? Oh my gosh!! How gross.... Have you seen her? yuck... anyways, I rarely go into the sparc site. If ever.   I have this and one other site I'm keeping up on, and I have finals next week... WHY would I bother with HER? She's the loser wife of my EX husband. Mike, who's behind in support.  Could it be that he's giving her shit about him not paying and this is her chance to try and fuck with me? Or it this her release because she's so ugly that he won't touch her? She's pathetic to IM me, accusing me of ANYTHING. Oh my gosh... LOL
jchallquist@excite.com I just got an email regarding *blackmail* from Mike; or was it actually sent by Shelly? It states, and i'm paraphrasing here, ... "one more thing. I am trying very hard  to NOT stoop to your level but just in case you forgot there are many embarasing things you have emailed or instant messged me about. would you like to see these things posted? or the ones from the ssss board?  think about what you are doing for a change and get some help" Okay not exactly a para-phrase, but you get the picture.  If you don't so this, I'll do this... Blackmail. LOL...  What I'm posting about is about things I"M dealing with. I'm dealing with NOT receiving child support currently. When and If I do receive child support from this person, I'll be the first to post it here. Just to show good faith, I DID remove his last name on this post.
jchallquist@excite.com  I got a letter in the mail from OREGON Department of Justice.  Child Support Program. Mike is now $ 7,089.76 in arrears. Monthly support is $406.00 per month and an additional $81.20 for arrears.  Total monthly he owes is now $487.20  Plus I got a second letter, Apparently Califorina found a possible employer. And forwarded that information on to Oregon.  CSP #:                      ********************* Current Support Amount:                          $406.00 Last support Amount: Case Balance:                                         $7,089.76            (May include current month's support) Obligor:                                            Xxxxxxxxx, Michael L.                                        Notice to Obligor of Order to Withhold Income  It states, "Your order requires the obligor listed above to carry health care coverage for the child(ren). Our records show that the obligor is not carrying health coverage. This office is responsible for enforcing the health care coverage provisions of your order. Therefore, we have sent the obligor's employer a notice to enroll the child(ren) and to withhold the cost of the premium, if any, from the obligor's wages.  I'm so excited. It's getting closer to when I might actually start recieving child support...  Edit due to Mike's embarrassment of the situation.  Of course, How many Mike's with his last name are out there??? Do a google search and try and find THIS one... You won't be able too. ;)  But, I thought I'd be kind enough to do this lil favor for him.  Of course, I heard the same old same old, " I took care of it all when I got a job..." Yea, we'll see.
Posted on FreeAdvice by me...  Ya know, this whole thing has gotten twisted. I will explain this once again --- simply put.  MIKE is OVER $6,000 in arrears. He has NOT paid support in the last three months.  Support is 406 per month for 2 kids. Arrears is to be paid @an additional $50 per month.  He is SUPPOSED to call on Sunday evenings, HE chooses when and if he calls. I DON"T answer the phone on Sunday evenings. The kids do. WHEN he calls. We have caller ID, so I make a point to let the kids get it. Last summer, he didn't exercise his visitation because HE didn't call to make arrangments. That's fine, they didn't want to go anyways. THEY ARE 15 and a half.   I WILL NOT make my kids get a job to cover the support that their dad is NOT paying. PERIOD. When they work, that money will be for 1. a car. 2 insurance. 3. frivoulous stuff they want. 4. college.  I DO have an income. A seperate income from my husband. Where I work has NOTHING to do with MIKE paying his support. PERIOD. Support was based BOTH of our incomes. HE was in college for 4 or 5 years. Now that he's finished, this means that theoritically he should be able to get a better paying job and then be able to easily pay his support. I'm not in the process of taking him for a modification. I don't want or need that. I just want the support to restart as soon as possible. Just like everybody else on this whole dang board. The kids deserve this support to be coming into our household.  The budget we have is for my FAMILY income. Like I said, the support money is to pay for the e
