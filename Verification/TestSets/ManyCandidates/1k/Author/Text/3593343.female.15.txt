I have never been so exhausted in my life. I worked my tail off this weekend. Friday I worked from 4pm-11:45 came home and got 3hours of sleep. Saturday I worked from 7am-11:00 came home and got 9 hours of sleep. Sunday, worked from 9am-5:30. So lastnight I slept like a baby. I went over to Justin's after he got off at 8:30 and spent some time with him. I came home around 11:30 or so b/c he has school tomorrow. But he doesnt have to go Tuesday b/c he has senior pictures. *YAY*  I had so much fun this weekend...only problem was I didnt see Justin as much as I intended. =S But he did come and see me and he called me. It was so hot in there though...especially Friday it was Me,Kiki,Dexter,Josh,Daniel,Kim,Cody,and some other woman Felisha (my boss) knew. But it was still fun..goofin off with everybody. and gahh Spencer is crazy...LoL...actin like he was snorting that Line Lime...LoL...or "abuda buda buda". And all the crazy times we tried to put Cody outside b/c we didnt want him around us b/c he gets on our nerves so bad. *grr* **HAHA** anywho...today's just another day I reckon... I think me and Justin might go out tonight...who knows. BUT anyway...I'm out...I may blog later.
There are stars  In the Southern sky  Southward as you go  There is moonlight  And moss in the trees  Down the Seven Bridges Road   Now I have loved you like a baby  Like some lonesome child  And I have loved you in a tame way  And I have loved you wild   Sometimes there's a part of me Has to turn form here and go  Running like a child from these warm stars  Down the Seven Bridges Road   There are stars in the Southern sky  And if ever you decide  You should go  There is a taste of time sweetened honey  Down the Seven Bridges Road     ----that is the BESTEST song...the Eagles ROCK!!----

Well today was very.... HOT !!!!  It got up to a wopping  95  degrees. And to make matters worse, I had to work...in that filthy hot concession stand. It was hotter in there than it was outside. I PROMISE! I decided to drive home, well we had to go by Veterans and get time cards to take to the Rec*Com, so I got to where I could see the fields and mom said turn right here in front of this cop...well the whole turning in front of the cop thing scared me b/c one: I didn't use my blinker and two: I was speeding. Well I pulled up to the gate and the cop come up behind me, I was like "OH CRAP-OLA" then I thought,hmm...mom was on the phone with Tracy a little bit ago and she called me while I was cleaning and I bet shes working. Well come to find out it was her and she was on her break so she could eat so she talked to us and ate and then she got called to some something on the mountain or something. Anywho,Justin's gotta work tomorrow. =( He has to work from 6am-3pm...but I have a family reunion to go to tomorrow at like noon in Skyline, then we're gonna leave there and come back by here and get our stuff and go over to my aunts and swim and Justin's gonna try to come by and swim or atleast hang out. I doubt I'll swim...UNLESS its as hot tomorrow as it was today...but I think I'm gonna lay out all day.  ~I Love Justin Hastings!!!!~
