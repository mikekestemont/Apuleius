yo, today was pretty boring considering the things I should have done today but was just too lazy.  I woke up and started filling out some apps when brett called me and wanted to see if i wanted to hit up angelo's with them, i did and it was good but they had to get back to work at 100.  I went straight home and finished filling out most of the apps and just watched tv for a pretty long while.  I called Richie but he was hanging out with Edna so I didn't turn in my apps.  I decided to go to the mall and get Brittney her sweatband so I told my mom I was gonna buy a sweatband for myself and then she gave me money for some gym shorts too.  I went to the mall and looked in a couple stores but none of them had the same wristband.  Thinking back on it I probably should've gotten her one that was similar but if I did that, I wouldn't have had enough money for the gym shorts I bought, so it was a trade off.  I got two pairs and then met my parents and Donny (my bro) at Taco Joes for dinner.  Brett was in band practice and messaged me to find out the score to the lakers game.  Of course I didn't know so I told him that I couldn't give it to him. Then Brittney messaged me.  Last night before I went to bed I messaged her saying "have fun at grad night" and this morning she messaged back and said thanks but I didn't think she would want to start getting into the whole talking thing again.  The message said "Richie told me to say hi to you".  I didn't know what to say to that so i just replied "what a great friend!" then she was just asking what i was doing and stuff and we went home and started watching the basketball game when she called me.  I picked up and she said that she was tired of messaging me and wanted to talk.  We just talked about grad night and she said that her friend Jenna had kind of blown her off to hang out with some guys or something and she had to hang out with people she didn't know too well.  Then she told me that I have to go with her next year because it would be more fun.  I started saying that I wasnt going to miss my grad night for Loma linda's but then I just didn't feel like doing the whole teasing thing so I told her I'd go to both. Whatever.  Her cell started breaking up and she said that she would call me when she got home.  I went to the gym a little bit after that to work out and brittney never called.  This kind of pisses me off, not because i really wanted to talk to her but because she basically lied to me.  stupid bitch.  oh well, im just gonna let it slide this time.  I don't know where this relationship between me and brittney is going but I'm gonna kind of ride it out.  If it progresses more then I'm gonna try to get at least one more kiss out of her ;) but if it doesn't move any further then I'm not gonna care too much.  There's millions of other girls that are better looking and a little better at controlling their mood swings than brittney.  She's just really fun to hang around and she's incredibly beautiful.  Fuck, i hope i'm not falling for her again.  Ok, she's actually really ugly and she's a bitch.  But for some reason I like her bitchiness, dammit.  Whatever, I think I like brittney again, but then again it could just be the fatigue talking.  I'll see if i still her tomorrow haha.  Well, you guys can catch the vapors as i be off and up out.
It's Wednesday night and yesterday was the last day of school! AFter school got out I was chillin with Brandon, BRett, and Richie when Richie got a call from Edna.  She was with Brittney and they wanted us to come over to Edna's house.  Brett and Brandon had band practice so we went over there.  As we got there, Jenna was leaving so Edna and Brittney were in the driveway.  We stayed out there and talked for a long time. Richie was being kind of quiet and i was trying to make jokes and have a good time.  Brittney and Edna were asking me why I'm so negative all the time cause Jenna told them that she thought i was a negative person.  This made me think about the things I've said and it doesn't seem like I'm very negative, but I just like to tease the girls a lot.  Either way, I'm gonna watch what I say and see if I actually am negative.  If so, I'll just be a little careful and that bad little trait will go away.  Anyway, after talking for a while, Brittney and Edna wanted to get their snack on so we hit up in-n-out.  I sat in the front seat and Brittney drove, Edna and rich were in the back.  But the cool thing was that Brittney went to some christian concert thing a couple weeks ago and got some drum sticks, so I was playin along with all the songs on her dashboard.  I think I'm gonna have to go to guitar center and buy some of thems for my car.  We went back to Edna's and decided to watch a movie, so we popped in Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  I hadn't seen it and I must say, its a good movie.  I especially like one quote from it :    "Cameron has never been in love - at least, nobody's ever been in love with him. If things don't change for him, he's gonna marry the first girl he lays, and she's gonna treat him like s
