hello all, my friend just made a site on here and i thought it was a good idea...that and i am bored outta my mind. mmm sprite. anyways, does anybody realize the importance of friendship? i dont think many people do, putting friendships on the line for petty things like relationships, which usually turn out liek crap anyways. why does life suck right now?! it was so good until the last week of school! i need someone to explain to me why things happen and turning points in our lives. bad things like...liers and cheaters and attention seekers that just piss me off. anyways looking on the bright side, i can just lounge all day!! well...i could if i was allowed...which im not...ANYWAYS! not pointing any fingers or anything *points* DAMMIT! i did it again. o by the way dont tell but i own a man prude *wink*. wow....i really do ramble but i need somewhere to ramble like this and no one will look at it anyways cuz who knows about this site! i didnt until 5 minutes ago. im tired. im sleeping now. nights! mwaz... *bites innocent passerby* mwaahaha...

It was SO much fun at Wasaga!! i had a blast. I really missed my friends Lauren and Amanda. We hung out a lot in school and i didnt see either of them for a while. Lauren was at the condo and Amanda and i just didnt make an effort to see each other. i made a bit of one but it didnt work for our schedules. So it felt really good that i could see my friends again and i dont think i realized just how MUCH i missed them until i saw them both again. Honestly(tw this movie called tank girl is one of the randomist, best movies i have ever seen....SEE IT!!). Anyways i get back from wasaga and now i cant get onto msn and its KILLING ME! i wanna talk to all the people who missed me while i was away for 5 days....well i hope people missed me lol. Niky? did u miss me? teehee...anyways yeah i was extremely bored so i decided to ramble out onto this blogger thing yet again. I think its going to become a bit of a habit for me now cuz it was the first thing i did on the computer besides checking email. Well, i would be chatting if i was aloud to download it onto this comp. mrah...anyways. Dont you love accessory shopping?? its something a woman can do and enjoy doing it because it has no real purpose...except to get crazy accessories that you can just show off tyo your friends. I went accessory shopping in wasaga cuz i had the money and wow it felt so damn good. i&nbsp; got a claddaugh (spellin) ring for only 10 bux!! its cheap for one of those things. I pointed the crown inwards cuz my heart doesnt belong to anyone. Meh. Anwyas im really just doing this for asolutely NO reason so im going to go do something else....something that doesnt involve much brain power cuz i am so dead right now. I can barely type. :D W00T!!! WASAGA!!!!
LIFE SUX!! But that's okay for now cause im gonna go to wasaga tomorrow!! wasaga u might say? wat is wasaga? wasaga is like one of the best beaches in the whole....ashleyville..Yes. And it is awesome. im going up there to go to my friends condo which her family rented out! Its gonna be awesome. im going to go check out all the sexy guys who go to the beach and be all like....O.O W00T!! Anyways life sucks right now cuz I keep thinking about my boyfriend who is actually a man prude. I mean im kinda hurt about the way he has been after he asked me out. He never made any effort to be with me and its almost like he didn't think he had to make any effort cuz he just wanted a girlfriend. I don't want him to do things cuz he feel like he has to do them i want him to do stuff on his own but i dont think that will happen very soon. And i kinda miss him and it hurts knowing that he didnt wanna see me that badly cuz he didnt say o lets hangm out before i go away for a month. He hasnt even asked me for my number yet. I mean...i dont even know if he likes it this was or if he doesnt think i wanna go any further but i do...meh. anyways life sux but im so craving ice cream right now and there isnt any! i want ice cream... :( meh. anyways im going to stop boring you now, whoever is reading this besides niky lol. i luv u guys and i hope i feel better soon cuz its wierd that im all asad, im not really that used to it :P :) ttyl all
ok so ive been going out with this guy for like...almost two months now and the most hes ever done to show me the least bit that hes interested is kiss me on the cheek after my friends got mad at him. That and he put his arm around me but only when the same friends yelled at him t
