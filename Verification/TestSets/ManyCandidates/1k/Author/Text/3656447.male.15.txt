once upon a time...ok, maybe i wont tell you the whole story about how i met these two lovely people, but ill give u the main storyline. well i was walking down the street one day with nat and kenny, when we came upon a young lady with square glasses, a missing tooth, and a party hat...well our first impression was that she was a psycho and that we should run the opposite direction as fast as possible, but out of the goodness of our hearts, we asked her if she would like to join us. so she did, and we found out her name was Gertrude. nat suggested that we take a boat ride, and we all agreed to it. we went to the dock and saw only one boat there, and strangely enough, it was a pirate ship! and we all know kenny and nat absolutley love pirates! so we couldnt say no to them. we climbed on board and found the captain of the ship, her name was Agnes. she had a patch over her right eye, a pirates hat on, a hitler mustache, and a peg leg. she told us that we could join her and her crew on their quest to find treasure, so we jumped at the opporotunity! and the rest is pretty much predictable...we sailed on, we were attacked by a giant squid, we crash landed on an island; me, nat, and kenny were rescued by an overpassing plane, and Agnes and Gertrude have been stranded on the island ever since! anyways, this is a picture of them i will always keep close to me, and i wish them luck without any food or supplies on that far away island... urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    ok, well i just got done telling you about ellies problems, but thats not the worst of it all. there is still kailey...yes kailey. she too has a serious illness, maybe even more serious that elley-nor's. she often gets things such as "monkey-migraines" and uncontrollable balve movements...yes, it is all true. she also has this face she does when she says "i told you so"...even though she never says that, lol! and thats what the pic is of. anyways, there is no apparent cure for her either, so i wish u luck with your "monkey-migraine" filled life kailey, and stop making that face and pointing at me...its not nice, and its scary!&nbsp; urlLink
ok, im sorry to inform u all that your very close friend ellie (aka BEANE) has some serious mental illness that is so serious, she has to go to Sacramento every weekend to get treatment. they say that it is all due to the very tight, blonde curls on her head. im not sure what to say about this, but i thought it was my duty to inform all of you about how serious this really is...thank you for your time, and we wish ellie a safe recovery (which isnt possible by the way)... ;)  urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink
well im really bored, so ill prolly just go to bed soon, even tho i slept for like 4 hours after school today...lol, im serious! anyways, i was just thinking about how people say that they fall in love in high school, and sometimes even before that, and i was thinking, is that really true? do we as teenagers really know what love is? personally, i feel that u can have a g/f or b/f, sure. but when you do have one, and u think ur in love, is it really love...or is it just infatuation? i guess it really got me thinking because i know of people that say they have been in love and are in love, and im just not sure if they really know what it is. personally the only friends i have that i think are in love are holly and andy, and when i have my first g/f, i want my relationship to be strong like theirs. i mean they've been together for over a year! and i think that's kinda defying the laws of relationships in high school! ;) well, i just thought id ask all of ur guys' opinions. do we really know what love is...what do u think?
urlLink    hey everyone! today, i decided to take up the subject of belgian waffles...yes u saw correctly, belgian waffles. i chose this topic for this lovely monday evening for no apparent reason. actually, there is somewhat a point to why i want to talk about belgian waffles...but we'll get to that later, right now, i want to give u the definition of a belgian waffle. it is a thick sweet waffle often eaten with ice cream or fruit sauce. (and its a noun for your information) anyways, i guess ill tell you why the hell im talking about belgian waffles...well not too long ago, the morning after kenny (STOCK) spent the night at my house before the day we went with montana to scandia. he guzzled down 5 thick, home-made belgian waffles...yes, 5! i wasnt sure if that was physically possible before it happened, but after it did...i was a believer! yes kenny, i believe now, all thanx to u. and any of you who dont believe, come to me and im sure we can arrange a private session with kenny where he can guzzle down 5 (if not more!) belgian waffles for u. that is all for now, until next time...im out!&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    hey guyz! this is kinda a test for this new "hello" picture thing. i think this is how im supposed to do it, and hopefully im right! anyways, in case u were wondering (which i know u always are!), this is a pic of my dog Hannah...sleeping in case u couldnt tell!&nbsp; urlLink
