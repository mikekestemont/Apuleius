I've started e-mailing a guy I've meet over the internet.  His picture's really cute and he says in his profile that he's into fantasy.  I put 'Buttercup seeks her Westley' as my headline to see if people get it and he did! He realised it was from the Princess Bride so you never know, things could happen. Tommy has been really flirty with me.  I was on poker and was in the middle of a coughing fit when he heard me.  He asked if I was OK and I said I had a bad chest at the moment.  He said Doesn't look bad to me.  But that's just TommyI guess.
That guy from the other night has had his membership taken away from him!  Martin said that he'd been a pest for a while now and that was the last straw.  I think that makes it 3 I've managed to have barred! Was talking to the new waitress Amanda and when I told her that He dumped me she was like Oh well, you can do much better than him.  And yep I can.
Was in work tonight and talking to Debs and Shiraaz about my interview.  He was there as well.  We were just talking about friends when He chipped in 'well most of my mates are in Plymouth, that's why I go there so often.'  I swear I had to bite my tongue to stop myself saying 'Well why don't you make all of us happy and fuck off back there then.'  I really wish I had. Had a bit of a surreal night actually.  I had a piss head punter tell me to get my tits out.  Naturally I complained.  It turns out that he's a brit living in Thailand over here for his daughters wedding and I think that says just about everything that you need to know about him.  The really weird thing was Tommy.  First off he asked if he could rub against me, but then that's just Tommy.  Then later on he told me I was looking beautiful.  I was like, um ok.  I know not to take him seriously because he's a coked up flirt but its nice to hear, especially from someone I do have a little crush on. Felt so horny yesterday.  Am seriously considering giving Matt a call for some no-strings sex.  I know that he'd be well up for it and I'd rather call him than meet some random guy.
Have come up with a new theory about people.  Admittedly it's one I came up with while rather pissed but still I think it holds up.  If you ask a person which they prefer cats or dogs they will tell you one or the other.  Each animal represents different character traits that that person values.  A cat person will say they prefer them because they're independent, they don't need anyone to look after them and care about no-one.  These traits are what a cat person looks for in other people. Now a dog person will say they prefer them because they're affectionate and loving.  Unlike cats they need people around them and crave company.  Likewise they'll look for people who are those things. Now cat people and dog people are on a basic level incompatable.  They look for completly different things in a relationship and want different things out of them. So the most important thing you ask someone you fancy isn't 'what sign are you' but rather 'cats or dogs'.  Be prepared for the answer and you'll save yourself alot of heart ache in the future.  Or at least that's my plan from now on!
Just had a job interview today.  It's as a PA/Editors Assistant in Croydon which is a lot closer to Wimbledon than the casino and as its a day job means no night bus and no working weekends!  I don't know if I've got it, I properbly haven't, I mean I have no experience working in an office.  Also the company seems to consist of just two blokes sitting in an office and me doing whatever they don't want to.  Oh well, it's got to be better than what I'm doing at the moment, at least I'll be away from Him and the thought of Him and his New Girlfriend.  One of the guys who interviewed me was really cute.  I know I can't think like that, I mean if it's a bad idea shagging a guy you work with when you work with other a hundred people, how bad is it to get off with your boss when there's only you and one other in the office?  Unthinkable. It's bad being at home by myself.  This is when I miss Him the most, when I'm alone and start getting bored.  But I realise now that part of this is loneliness and not wanting Him back.  It really is a case of wanting anyone and He's the person I think about.  The problem is that I need to get out more, not just after my dayshift but on my days off as well.  Oh well am on holiday from Sunday night and am going home to see my family.  At least then I'll have people around me.  Plus Stacey will be back tomorrow so I'll have her for company and the dog as well. I really hope I get the job.
Was in the pub tonight with my mate John and other people and it occured to me that i do really fancy him.  The only problem is that he's been with his mrs Lisa for nearly three years.  they've been together since i met them two years ago and before that in glasgow.  She gave up being a lesbian for him so i know what they mean to each other.  i also know that they are having problems at the moment.  they lost twins recently and since then Lisa has been depressed.  Today she asked me if i knew any cure for depression, but like i told her i lived with a depressive mother for years and h
