i snatched up a peacock feather today. they're actually quite dull in reality, contrary to the popular opinion given by most peacock media outlets. several of them in overlay would work for the good of the people, i suppose, but with american civil liberties the way they are i wouldn't push for that anytime soon.  oh, and the reality of the many slogans of the snickers corporation is finally sinking in. snickers really satisfies. hungry? grab a snickers. packed with excitement. always low prices, always snickers. enjoy snickers. simply the snickers. the list goes on and you know it.  signing out for long weekends away from civilization, this is captain boo yeah and the anti-fraction.
i just wanted to say congratulations to myself.   nathan you are a special person.  the kind that is dedicated to writing things down even when no one will read them. the kind so vein and self-annointing that you would join the masses conceition and dedicate parts of your life to writing about yourself, even after you've spent so much time in front of a mirror visualizing a similar aspect.  congra-tootles-lations
all the time i walk around this sit down campfire lusting life and picture tale the cotton sails that may have former use in time the reminisce comes splosh splash splish and happy fills the heads of every one of these circlers, a fire for their interest  so silent in the sunk and slosh that captures every day we tread our feet as heavy as the grass permits an indent lay and simple sicked up nowhere rhymes and tickle round our tongues until the rain comes hailing sounds to bless us, every one...
so here i am getting back into the blogging world thinking that someone somewhere will be interested in what i have to offer....
So this is Tristan in full fledged rocker status. With hair like that who needs a proper speech pattern?

there's a woodchuck parading around in my field of vision. he has origin issues. he spends his days rooting around looking for sustenance, every now and then looking up quickly and intentely to determine if i'm a threat or not. or to ponder how his mother being a gopher and his father a beaver will affect his adult life. the toiling of a woodchuck is complicated, at best.
i find myself in new music and hah hah sunburns. wearing a mesh trucker cap backwards will leave the most interesting of speckles on a man's brow.   i am a son of Ares, born in the time of the ram and filled with the spinning chase of the two fishes, living a life of fortune cookie creativity and unprecedented boon vs. bust. when the big god of war shakes his clutchy fists and even Zeus doesn't mind to turn the blind eye as the thunder comes crackling through the cool blue sky of this northern home i find myself prone to, well, no one minds all that much attention, but I know who he shakes his fist for.  still, i do a lot of sitting slouched and flecking my lungs with tar and dismissing all of the healthy dark green veggies and high fibre living that i do otherwise.    the sun is always coming. and i suppose i'm always waiting for it. every any day, but in particular those sparkling lens flare pumpkin hue mornings, when i step outside into the morning glare leading me out of the driveway and a big picture frame window cropping out my own little part of the forest. i'm just another child of the whole, a real People of the Sun. we're all just  urlLink People .   good luck.

So...i went to this comedy club in my own newly claimed hometown, that's erie pa for all of you dedicated listeners who don't front on the old school rap. anyway, comedy comedy comedy. that's funny stuff. here's the wrap up:  comedian one: made a joke about mexicans (keep in mind the entire audience [nearly let alone erie's population] is white) and then went on to racist black jokes. now i'm no racist, but i love racist jokes. white, black, mexican, negro, nigger dare i say, whatever. racism is so unrealistic to me at this point that making jokes about it is the only proper way to go about life.  comedian two: a woman. hah! funny in itself, you say, and i agree. i know, i know, there's nothing funny about women, but this girl sounded like she was a dislexic reading from a cue card, but her jokes were so funny it shone through. is that how you spell shone? as in "shown": hah again.  comedian three. too funny. that's all. hilarity about cops and killing deer and he was on jay leno, which makes him cool, because whatever anyone says, letterman isn't the top spot. old people like jay, or so i hear, but i grew up through college on jay, so that's that.  so i was with three others, and when the show was over, and i'd had five or ten beers, i suggested we continue this raunch at calimari's, some little joint with an outside drinkery in the port town, and no one was up except the least likely of suspects, linda, who i barely knew. so we went, yada yada yada, talk shit on people at work, and we each had a drink. then i ordered a second and started drinking it when everyone was like - hah! we're leaving sucka chump foo. so there i was, alone, drinking, smoking, looking good in my hat.  the end came i left and now i'm typing. see the previous audio blog for info on the hooker i ran into...  later.

i don't know what to think about that 70's show. sobre, i find it to be drab at best but droll at worst. on a more intoxicated note, i seem to think that it is incredibly horrible and amazingly hilarious all in the same bit. and then i go their website and read some of the most aweful hubbub ever.  and laugh tracks, t
