We have moved!! We are no longer here, but  urlLink here !!!
Ok, i dunno what to put here, so i'll write a story.. yes, that seems in order.  Once there was a little boy called Adam. He liked whistling and singing and all things musical. He especially liked the guitar and vocals.  One day, he met a girl called... Jane. At first they hated each other... completely drove each other up the wall. That's why Jane stole his guitar. Which Adam got a little bit annoyed about and ripped her dress. Then things got  real  bad. --censored-- And then jane moved away. Which was just as well because Adam had been planning to set Jane's house alight. Fifteen years later, Adam moved away too. And Jane moved away from where she moved to after meeting Adam.  Perhaps it was fate.. or perhaps it was because they had dodgy estate agents.. but whatever the reason, they managed to end up in the same district.. and even on the same road.  "Oh my God.. Adam Levine?" "What?" "It's me, Jane!" "Jane?" "Jane Cai." "Wha..?" "I stole your guitar in 4th grade?" "My guitar? Errrr..." "Oh never mind." Jane didn't think anything of it. But she hadn't really expected him to have gotten so... fit. Which is why she didn't dream about him, or him and his guitar, or him ripping her dress that night... Not at all! **A week later** Adam runs up to Jane as she sets off to Sainsbury's. "Jane Cai!!!! I remember you!" "Really?" "Yeh! You know, I had a major crush on you in 4th grade.. right after you stole my guitar. In fact, right up to when you left really," he says, blushing.  Jane didn't want to admit it but she did too. Right after he tore her dress.  Part 2 coming soon.
"I'm so bored," says Jesse, sprawled across the grungy brown couch, which looked like it once been white. "Let's watch Wimbledon," suggests Adam. "I heard Henman's through to the final!" says Mickey excitedly. "Can't wait to check out his le - I mean, his moves. Moves. I was not just about to say legs. Moves. Ooh Lilo and Stitch! Can we get the DVD?" "I was thinking more of practising our songs. Our recording session didn't go too well yesterday." Jesse grunts. "Oh come on," says Adam, dragging himself off the armchair and making his way to their practice room, which they have padded with bits of sponge, cushion and bubblewrap to avoid the neighbours from complaining. "Nnnng," comes the grunt from Mickey, who starts to claim that somebody has stuck his bottom to the floor. "Oh Mickey get your lazy ass here and get on that bass," says Jesse, rolling off the couch and attempting to roll right into the practice room.  "I told you already! I'm stuck to the carpet!" "Oh you lazy old git," says Jesse, coming back to grab Mickey by the ear and drag him over to the practice room. They start playing. "Why aren't you playing or singing?" Jesse wonders.  "In case you hadn't noticed.." ".. Hey, wait a minute, where's Ryan?" "...Ryan is not here and we do not have drums backing, and you and Mickey are out of time. And Mickey seems to be playing Pop Goes the Weasel." "Doo doo doo doo," hums Mickey, jutting his head forwards and back (rather like a chicken) to an unknown beat. "So where the hell is Ryan??" demands Jesse. "Dunno. Call him on your cell phone," suggests Adam. "OK." "Well what are you waiting for??" Adam says irritably after about 5 minutes of watching Jesse fiddling with a thread on his trousers. "Don't have a cell phone." Adam heaves a huge sigh and buries his head in his hands.  I cannot believe I am stuck here with there loons,  he thinks.  It's a wonder I haven't cracked up yet.   "Well then call him using the regular phone!!" Adam yells.  "Adam, keep your wig on! I think.." Adam shoots a glare at Mickey who immediately shuts up.  Why do I live with a bunch of weirdos??  There is an awkward silence, after which Jesse creeps out quietly to use the phone in the hallway.  "Please stop looking at me like that," says Mickey quietly, his sanity curiousy returning to him.  "Sorry," says Adam, quickly averting his eyes to his guitar.   Everything is so fucking fucked up. Ryan isn't fucking here. Where the fuck is he? We can't do any fucking thing without the fucking drums. Jesse is fucking getting on my fucking nerves. Mickey has lost his fucking sanity. Jane fucking caught me with Malpreet. I don't even fucking know who I fucking prefer. I wish all this fucking fucked-up-ness would fucking go away. And I can't stop fucking swearing. Even in my fucking head.  I'm full of regret For all things that I've done and said
"Hey," says Ryan. "Oh, hi," says Jane, jumping.  He has a real knack of creeping up on me.  "Latte?" "Yes thanks." Ryan buys the lattes and they go to sit down. Ryan smiles at her.  Uh, cool. So his smile is nice. Please stop smiling. "How have you been?" "Hah, still trying to get over last night really." "Me too," chuckles Ryan. "You have no idea," says Jane.  Oh crap, did I say that out loud? Now he's gonna ask..  "How do you mean?"  Great.  "Well, it was nothing really. I bumped into someone. That's all." "Oh really?" says Ryan distractedly. "How about you?" "Oh same old same old.. Mickey my housemate is being a weirdo as usual..."  "Cool, you live with other people?" "Yeh, three others. We're in a band." "Cool," says Jane, rather intrigued. "Yeh, Mickey's a bit strange sometimes, but I have to admit, his quirks are funny too."  Jane starts to fall asleep.  Maybe I shouldn't have asked him about his housemates. God.  "...Jesse found some random chick and Adam... actually, I don't actually..." Jane's ears prick up.  Well, there's gotta be about 10 million Adams in the world.  "...But I
