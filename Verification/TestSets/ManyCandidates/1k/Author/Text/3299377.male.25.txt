I had the misfortune of watching a truly obnoxious movie this weekend. ‘Hum Tum’ ended up being a mishmash of all things that can possibly go wrong in a movie. The lead couple had no chemistry. The editing was pathetic. The set piece tear jerker scenes were plastic. The timing of the not too pleasant songs was worse than could have been though possible and the ending was…… well lets just say that if you haven’t caught onto the fact that this is a really, really bad movie then you need to have your head examined.  I also watched ‘Day After Tomorrow’ its not great but it isn’t bad either. Roland Emmerich seems to specialize in making movies in which the actors are subordinate to the movie and its setting. Thankfully he then proceeds to save himself a whole load of money by not casting top notch actors. Actually it all makes sense in a skewed sort of way. The movie had its really bad moments but on the whole it did what it set out to do. And that is to wow audiences with effects sequences, which are truly amazing in their sheer scale. Sure the theme is outlandish and very over the top but I wasn’t looking for a National Geographic Documentary anyway. All in all its worth a watch.
‘Hellboy’ I must admit that the trailer had me expecting more than the movie turned out to be. Its not that Hellboy is a bad movie its just that its not the movie it could have been. While Del torro has done a decent job of characterizing the main protagonist the other characters unfortunately do not get the same treatment, which doesn’t leave us with many hooks to attach ourselves to the characters or the movie.  Did I enjoy the movie though? Sure, whats not to like? There’s a big red demon with a stone hand and snappy one-liners, a human fish with ESP, a pretty lady who bursts into flames, a whole bunch of nice Fx and some decent monsters.  The villans though just didn’t come out as dangerous enough and the final battle simply wasn’t apocalyptic enough. Something you sort of expect in a comic book movie.  All in all it’s a fun movie with just a little less bang than I would have hoped for.
Does it occur to the piffling moron who goes and blindly votes for A or B that A or B are different in name only. I think the entire populace of India would be better off if we abstained from voting.  I mean look at the farcical affair whose results we were treated to today. Does the average office going middle class person give a hoot either way whether it’s the corrupt BJP buggers or the corrupt Congress buggers ruining this country?   The net result is ruination whether its forced down our throats by ‘the lotus’ or ‘the hand‘ is a piffling triviality which is scarily inconsequential. Which of course brings us back to my initial suggestion of the entire country abstaining. Maybe the sound of wind whistling through empty poll stations will be heard more clearly than our cries.  Surprisingly, as stirring that rather weighty prologue might have been it does not even begin to touch upon the topic which moved me to write. Fortunately or unfortunately we seem (at least in my opinion) to be on our way to welcoming an Ex Italian lady as our next prime minister.  Now you must realize that I have absolutely nothing against Italy or its people I just find it remarkable that at the end of the day the Indian voter is ‘smart’ or ‘stupid’ enough to actually elect a naturalized citizen as the wielder of ‘Supreme Executive Power’ in the country.  I find this amazing fact rather disturbing at best because try as I might to associate this outcome to the glorious magnanimity and wisdom of the average Indian I know that the true reason resides in our own stupidity.  Which, brings me back to my original rant wouldn’t it have been better to simply not vote.  My countrymen still baffle me……   or maybe I baffle my countrymen……
I really do. It’s like some sort of irrepressible disease afflicting me. For some reason I cannot really fathom I am drawn to them. Drawn to them? Heck half the times I’ll initiate them even if deep inside I know I’m fighting a loosing battle. At least that way I can lull unsuspecting people into arguments with me.  Most of my friends no longer argue with me. The fact that I relish an argument almost seems to confound them. Since most of them see it as some sort of disagreeable activity to be partaken of reluctantly and ended as soon as possible they find it difficult if not downright impossible to understand how I can actually enjoy it.  Come on people get with the act. Thrust, parry, limber up those linguistic muscles and pump some factual dumbbells. Give your poor brain a workout apart from the 9 to 9 grind we subject it to every day.  …or at least argue with me about it. :-)
Seriously I have no recollection why i ever undertook this endeavour.   strange!!!   and disturbing too!!
Every time I see a movie based on the book I feel like crying. Why oh why does Hollywood insist on taking a perfectly good book and creating a visual monstrosity out of it devoid of all soul and emotion. The Harry Potter series of books is a pleasure to read and it pains me to think that children are going to walk away with a stunted intellectually challenged version of what is actually a truly beautiful story.  I realize that it is a near impossible task to compress a 300 page book into a 150 minute motion picture but that is precisely the reason why one must refrain from hackneyed attempts to accomplish it. Peter Jackson took 3 very long movies and came rather close to accomplishing the near impossible in the Lord of the Rings a
