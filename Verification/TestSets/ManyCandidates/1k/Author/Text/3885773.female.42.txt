"The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function."  ~ F. Scott Fitzgerald
The Beatles Eleanor Rigby  (Lennon/McCartney)   Ah, look at all the lonely people  Ah, look at all the lonely people   Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been  Lives in a dream  Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door  Who is it for?   All the lonely people  Where do they all come from?  All the lonely people  Where do they all belong?   Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear  No one comes near  Look at him working, darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there  What does he care?   All the lonely people  Where do they all come from?  All the lonely people  Where do they all belong?   Ah, look at all the lonely people  Ah, look at all the lonely people   Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name  Nobody came  Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave  No one was saved   All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people)  Where do they all come from?  All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people)  Where do they all belong?
Desiderata   Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story.   Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.    Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism.    Be yourself. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass.    Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.    You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.    Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul.    With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.    Max Ehrmann, Desiderata, Copyright 1952.
Such truths should arrive loudly  with clanging cymbals and crashing thunder. Or as seeping, creeping cold with icy tongues licking to numb my core.  Then I could cover my ears or with flint and steel strike a hopeful spark. What can I do in a room so full of Empty the echoes have flown?     jcr2004
I have never smoked, but I have lived with smokers for most of my life. Several times, I have held a lit cigarette in my hand and considered taking up the habit, but I have never taken two consecutive drags. It's not that I immediately began coughing or felt I was going to be sick, it is more a matter of it not feeling like something I would do. When I look at my hand holding a cigarette, it seems like someone else's hand.   There is much I envy about smoking, though.   For one thing, the camaraderie. There is an automatic sense of something in common when two smokers come together, even if they share nothing else. Simply offering a light is a form of communication, an expression of some basic acceptance and understanding. A group of strangers can stand around outside and smoke together, saying very little and still feel as if they have shared an experience with one another. We non-smokers stand there feeling separate from the group. And when I see my partner lean over to light another woman's cigarette, I feel such an intense, unreasonable jealousy that I hardly recognize myself -- it catches me off guard every time. I feel like asking why he can't just hand her the book of matches. But I know that's not how it's done.   Smoking seems a big conversational aid, too. An elaborate lighting up ritual can buy a person a lot of time. Naturally he cannot be expected to respond until that first drag has been completely inhaled, savored and contemplatively exhaled. Meanwhile, we non-smokers run the risk of being considered evasive if we don't reply immediately to another's query or suggestion. Taking a drink of coffee just does not consume a fairly proportionate amount of time, no matter how much I try, and it doesn't help that I drink it black. I have no sugar packets to open or spoon to stir 'round and 'round as I gaze contemplatively into the swirling liquid.   Stress reduction is another apparent benefit to smoking. Some attribute the peacefulness they feel to the chemicals included in tobacco, while others say it is the rhythm of it, the physical comfort of it. Either way, sometimes when I come to the end of a work day with a person who has taken multiple cigarette breaks and is still complaining about stress, I f
