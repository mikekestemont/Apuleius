I’ve just cancelled my ‘web’ access on my phone that Verizon so nicely charges five bones a month for. While it’s a neat idea, I used it approximately three times. When it comes down to it, is any information REALLY that important that I must have it right fucking now? Once again, I am grounded in the reality that a phone is a phone. I tend to get caught up in all the newest bells, whistles, and offerings, and forget that all the thing really needs to do is unfailingly make and obtain calls. Imagine that. Thankfully, the phone and coverage for me is fantastic, so I have no complaints there. I also get to bark various commands at it to do my every bidding, which makes me feel superior and powerful.
Let the earth tremble and the heavens pour.  I am going to the gym.  This of course is, by itself, nothing special. The special part is that it’s me. The guy who will pay his kids to get him a soda so he does not have to move. After the deal with my back, and this little thing called a mirror, I’ve finally decided to stop being a fatass and get back into shape. Not that I am some sort of huge couchcreature, but I defiantly ain’t what I used to be. Not only did I join this ‘gym’ but I am going at five in the morning. And also, gasp - watching what I eat. It’s like crashlanding on an entirely new planet. A strange, odd planet, but one that you begin to sort of like. I already feel much better, have more energy, etc. Why anybody would really want to know all of this, I’m not sure. But that is why I have a blog, so I can say shit about myself that nobody really cares about. Viva la Ego.
I hate buying software.  No, it's not the money. I have no problem supporting a developer that makes a good product. Especially smaller, independent ones that don't rhyme with RICROMOFT.   What I hate is this: there is always something better around the corner. And sometimes, it's free.  Take my current situation with Winamp5. After using older versions for quite awhile, and really liking the library feature to organize my MP3's, I thought it was time to pony up the cash. I was quite happy until I found I-tunes.  I-tunes does a fantastic job of organizing your music library. Much better than Winamp, in my opinion. I-tunes also has one other fantastic feature.  It's free.  I admit, I am always playing with new software, looking for the next great thing. The problem is that there are simply too many good products released weekly, especially the smaller utilities.   So what's the answer?   I have no idea. I am sure in two weeks, I'll move on to something else. I just won't be buying as quickly as before, and I'll do more research, I suppose.  Or not.
urlLink CNN.com - Ronald Reagan dies at 93 - Jun 5, 2004   Rest in peace, Mr. President. You deserve it.
Today's challenge is to manage  not &nbsp;to read or hear anything about  urlLink The Village  before one sees it this weekend. Which is just about damn near impossible with the media overload being shoved down our throats everyday. Turn on the radio,  urlLink  Howard Stern   is talking about it. Visit just about any website, touche. I am sure people will start talking about it at work soon, with no respect to those who have not seen it. See, I don't know much about the movie, other than the trailers, and I'd like to keep it that way. So you people who have seen it - STFU. At least for a couple weeks, ok?    urlLink Geekman . For those that don't work in the IT industry, please buy one, and abuse  it  instead of us. It may make you feel good for a minute, while you are angry, but in the end, we all know we are smarter than you. Let it go.   &nbsp;
We all know what he would do. But what would he  urlLink drive?
Microsoft has a  urlLink beta news portal  up and running.  I guess  urlLink Google  really makes them nervous, and heaven knows we  really  need yet another news portal, since good news is so hard to find. On the internet.     If cake is your thing, or the  creation of cakes,  take a look at a  urlLink Thorax Cake , created by the talented and not at all disturbed Barbara Jo.      (pssst Blogger - you might want to throw Google into your spellchecker. Since they own you, and all.)
I suppose, if one desires their blog to be read on a regular basis, they must likewise  update  said log as well.        I obviously have a problem with this.        Since we decommissioned  urlLink the toast , I really have not felt like writing much. Sometimes a good break is needed.        So here I am, making an attempt to keep this thing updated on a regular basis, so those that  do  stop by won't shake their heads and move on.        I am not sure what I'll write about. Probably not games. Sure, I could tell you how fantastic  urlLink ESPN NFL Football 2K5  is, and at twenty bucks, and absolute  steal . I could type my hopes that more companies follow the brave lead taken, and re-think the pricing of their titles. I could blather on about how I feel  urlLink Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay  is the best FPS since  urlLink Half-Life . (I could also, in the same sentence, damn the FPS label it has, and add it has a little bit of  every  genre mixed in, like a tasty soup.) But I won't. I could tell you that  urlLink City of Heroes  nearly stole two months of my life, like a perfumed harlot in the night. Nah.        I guess this space will be dedicated to whatever is on my mind at the time. Hopefully you'll stick around for the ride.        (pssst....have you tried  urlLink F
