I can't believe it I had it And now it's gone (who knows, maybe it was farther from my reach than I thought) And I've noticed in this past while That I'm tired of life spitting in my face With a gleam in it's eye as it bares its sharp teeth (While the stench of it's breathe has made life foul) Then there is fate (Fate.....what a fucking joke) And I wonder what it has in store for me Or even if it has forgotten me in this fast paced world  Nice guys finish last... How many times have I heard that line? Yet the more and more I hear it The more and more it seems true (sadly) As the guys who are assholes seem to get the girl And the guys who cheat, always seem to be better off As they're sickening schemes seem invisible to the girls that meet them And the girls become distraught and hurt at the thought of being alone While the very few of us who are still genuinely nice (very few indeed it seems) We are left alone, while people are asking "What ever happened to the nice guys?" And we stand there without attention or even a look For even if we did speak out loud Life and fate would only screw us over once more...
Time after time, I've come back to write While time after time, the same things every night But this time it's different I can't explain it, but it's there  Or could it now be the fact, that you're here?...  You've asked me twice now As I've stared into your deep wandering eyes "What are you thinking?" While "nothing", was my reply  While the fact of the matter was, was that you were there...  You say your not special That you're plain That you're simple Yet you are everything I want And you're more than I need  So the next time you find me With my eyes strongly fixed to yours Know now what I'm thinking As I feel lucky to even hold you  To have you in my arms As your lips graze against mine To see you still standing there While a soft smile breaks on your face And it all makes me realize how lucky I've become  And the fact is, is that you're here...
As I contemplate my decisions and actions I question myself Why would a person bother trying? When they know that failure rests so close Why do we carry the never-give-up attitude? When an action cannot steer a course right Why is it that we feel? When there is a chance that we will be hurt  But as I reflect on my indecisiveness towards fate I realize that this is what makes us human Our choice to be hurt, for a chance at love Our attempt to change destiny, when fate spits in our face Our battle to live, while death stares at us near by We are a species of luck and chance Or so what many think  But at times, one may sit and wonder If our lives have been chosen at random As she becomes wealthy As he becomes famous While others lay in gutters that represent what's left of their battles  What makes fate smile so greatly on one person While another has been forgotten? From birth some are destined for greatness While others have but days to enjoy life This is what has been questioning me As I hope for fates strings to be cut with a knife
Love, what's the use? With attempts made by so many More than most have been hit with reality A reality where there is loneliness, pain and death  Why is it that we, the knowledgeable, must endure this hurt? So that the few, oh so very few can reap the benefits of another While we sit, alone and crying at the fact that we will never Love  We shall never know, nor feel what the grace of another is like To rely and be cared for, to entrust in someone else as they hold you tight While this harsh reality hits and tears at the flesh of us less fortunate With a pain that never really subsides until we are met with death  There are however glimpses, or moments when we may think we know Love But as we are met with this feeling, we are quickly snapped back to reality To realize that there is no hope, no reason and nothing to try for As a life that dangles above a pit of doom on a string comes one step closer to snapping... To plummet alone, with no notice or thoughts of remorse, as this life was meaningless...
I should've known something was amiss From the first time you looked at me and said yes It seems that lately all the rage are promises Yet somehow you never seem to put them to the test  Left alone, just waiting there by the phone Hoping a call would come my way While later I find out, you never were at home Instead you found it fun, to use me and play  Who would've known you could let a phone ring so many times As the realization of an empty promise forms in your mind "We'll do it again, sometime soon", is said over and again And I smile and respond, "ok, sounds good" Knowing that I'll never really see you  Empty promises, something I'll always see From the moment you learn you'd have to be seen with me And the hurt of being let down resides deep within While I subside with failure once again  It seems to be that I'll never be the one The lucky guy who always get's the girl Or even the guy who can have a little fun  I've tried and tried to push it aside With the sight of a perfect world gone awry It's to the point where I just really don't give a shit To the point of where I just don't want t
