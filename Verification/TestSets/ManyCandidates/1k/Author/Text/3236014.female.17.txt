this avril song reminds me of last year...no hate, just fun. we got some food at mcdonalds and ate it at the park. clancy bought alka-seltzer to see if seagulls really do explode. he smashed them up and wrapped them in bread and threw them at the seagulls. they ate them. they didn't explode. at least while we were there. we played on the merry go round. i was still eating my cheeseburger. i was the last one off, lying in the middle watching the sky spin around slower and slower. devon aggravated me trying to take pictures of me with his disposable camera.  why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
launch told me i can't listen to any more music for the rest of the month. they have stupid limits like that now. i hope they know i've been listening to it since 7th grade. they should give me special privileges or something. back in the day you could listen for as long as you want, could skip songs as much as you want, and like 2 commercials an hour. hell, they weren't even merged with yahoo yet. yahoo sucks. i typed all this with one hand. the mouse is sleeping in my other one. yea i'm bored. bitching one-handed over a freakin net-radio site at 2 am. at least tomorrow is the last day of this month.
billy's going to come visit next weekend.
-Perfect- You're the perfect girlfriend. Which means you're rare or that you cheated :P You're the kind of chick that can hang out with your boyfriend's friends and be silly. You don't care about presents or about going to fancy places. Hell, just hang out. You're just happy being around your boyfriend.    urlLink   What Kind of Girlfriend Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    I think that Hellraiser Hello Kitty was a lot more fitting...don't you think?
I've had animals sleeping on me all day. first it was my cat. then it was the baby mouse my sister found in the kitchen drawer last night. it's so tiny. i fed it some pineapple and it went hyper. but now it's sleeping again. in my sleeve again. it likes milk too.  -Me   So close no matter how far couldn't be much more from the heart forever trusting who we are and nothing else matters never opened myself this way life is ours, we live it our way all these words I don't just say and nothing else matters trust I seek and I find in you every day for us something new open mind for a different view and nothing else matters never cared for what they do never cared for what they know but I know so close no matter how far couldn't be much more from the heart forever trusting who we are and nothing else matters never cared for what they do never cared for what they know but I know never opened myself this way life is ours, we live it our way all these words I don't just say trust I seek and I find in you every day for us something new open mind for a different view and nothing else matters never cared for what they say never cared for games they play never cared for what they do never cared for what they know and I know so close no matter how far couldn't be much more from the heart forever trusting who we are no nothing else matters.  -Metallica

I watched a movie about a school shooting. it made me want to shoot people. and hug both the guys that killed everyone. am i disturbing you?
it's 6:36.  I slept most of the day. I have a bad case of cramps. In between napping I made macaroni and cheese and peanut butter balls. Kelly also called to see if we'd be going to visit her...but my mom decided not to. what a crap weekend. it's STILL raining. I like music.
