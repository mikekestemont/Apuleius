I am single.  Let's get that out of the way.  Alleah's now angry at me for asking the girls to convince her to break up with me.  I'll admit that that was low, and cowardly.  I did it only to prevent Alleah's wrath from being unleashed upon me.  Unfortunately, it backfired when the girls told her about said plan.  I was trying to get some kind of neutrality about the whole thing, but it appears I misjudged the girls' inability to keep secrets from each other.  But, is it the right thing to tell one a secret involving them when it only causes everyone involved harm?  I think not, but...whatever.      In other news, Drew's starting a new band, called Chasing Chester.  It seems the current line-up is him on vocals, someone named Spencer on bass (Schachtel?), and no word yet on a drummer, but Nolan has apparantely volunteered or has been asked.  Who knows how far this thing will go, but I'm looking forward to the results.  And shazbot to all you who think Drew will just flake and be a jerk, because he's a nice guy.  You all are living in the past.  You know who you are.       So, I'm lonely and tired, and going to the Comox Folkfest tomorrow.  Naramata is in a week.  I'm stoked for everything.  Everything except being lonely and tired.  Perhaps I'll put up a personal next time I blog...not that I'm...pathetic or anything...yeah.  I can't fool them.  Well, you know what?  You..y-you're crazy, aren't you?  Ha..ha, y-yes, you're certifiably insane!  Gastrointestinal cancer with a side of genital warts!  This is the Rather Insane Dark Horse, signing off.
My father phoned this morning, and said the family was probably coming home tomorrow.&nbsp; Noooooooo!&nbsp; They were supposed to be gone until Saturday or Sunday!&nbsp; Monkey must be missing his computer and his girlfriend.&nbsp; Boo on Monkey.&nbsp; I just beat Metal Gear Solid, but my game froze, and I couldn't save it!&nbsp; I don't remember where I saved last.&nbsp; Probably a long time ago.&nbsp; Sux0r.&nbsp; Anyway.&nbsp; I still haven't finished my paper on the TBoLaD, but I've got until&nbsp;August 8th, and then the 14th til the 22nd to finish (Naramata, no computers there.)&nbsp; 12 days until Naramata, btw.&nbsp; To bad Brianna can't go...but Laura is, so at least I can show someone the awesemity that is Naramata.&nbsp; I wonder who we'll attach ourselves to this year?&nbsp; Beth and her troupe?&nbsp; Lloweyn, and Karen, the couple who aren't *actually* a couple, but really should be.&nbsp; They're just so perfect for each other, but I guess they don't want to risk a relationship for fear of messing up the friendship, besides the fact that she lives in Okotoks, Alberta, while he lives in Van (that's Vancouver, BC, for anyone reading who doesn't live on the West Coast of Canada, as if anyone reads this but my friends).&nbsp; Or perhaps the random group of whoever from wherever that I hooked up with three or four years ago, and still see around Naramata.&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; The only guarantee is fun.&nbsp; I really need to do more job-hunting.&nbsp; I need to check back at the places I've already been.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; I'll find a job sooner or later.&nbsp; I hope.&nbsp; Well, this is the Tired Dark Horse, signing off.
I demand that the author of Konsekai: Swordwaltzer draw faster!!&nbsp; I love that comic, but the site got hacked at the beginning of June, and he's updated the comic once since.&nbsp; It sucks.&nbsp; Anyways, here in Nanaimo, we're having ourselves a heatwave.&nbsp; It's fucking hot.&nbsp; I'm going to strip nude and sit outside under the sprinklers.&nbsp; But then, you'd like that, wouldn't you?&nbsp; So I won't.&nbsp; I'll just take the dog for a walk and get even sweatier.&nbsp; Haha...so tired...heat must be getting to me.&nbsp; It's baking my brain.&nbsp; I need to finish my presentation for the Symposium.&nbsp; It's on the Tibetan Book of Living and Dying by Sogyal Rinpoche.&nbsp; I don't really have alot to say.&nbsp; Road trip tomorrow, it'll be more interesting than stuff here.
I've become totally obsessed with watching Hellsing on Web TV.&nbsp; It's an anime series set in Britain&nbsp;about a vampire called Alucard (or Arucard, depending on whether it's the show...or the credits.), who works for the Hellsing organization for unknown reasons.&nbsp; The Hellsing organization is a black ops force of 'Religious Knights', trained to killed vampires.&nbsp; It is led by Sir Integra(l) Wingates Hellsing, daughter of the founder, I believe.&nbsp; In the first episode, a vampire masquerades as a preist and kills a police unit&nbsp;and almost decimates a D-11 force, one of the members of which is Seras Victoria, or "Police Girl".&nbsp; She is captured by the vampire, and Alucard has to shoot through her to hit the vampire in the heart with his holy high caliber pistol.&nbsp; So, he drinks Seras' blood, making her his servant, but saving her life...in a way.&nbsp; She is now a vampire, and works for the Hellsing organization as Alucard's servant, and of course, using her&nbsp;Mad Vampire strength and skill to put the human members of Hellsing to shame...and so, they battle the forces of&nbsp;evil&nbsp;every episode, and I enjoy it immensely.&nbsp; I know, I'm a nerd, but I looooooooove Hellsing.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's my little spiel, because I love anime.&nbsp; I apologize to everyone who might think I'm wasting my time watching animes about vampires in Britain, where everyone coincidentally speaks Japanese.&nbsp; It's just so awesome.&nbsp; Alucard has the ability to become some kind of Hellhound to defeat the more powerful of his enemies, and wields large&nbsp;dual handguns, loaded with bullets made from melted crosses, which somehow kills vampires.&nbsp; Maybe they were silver crosses.&nbsp; Silver kills vamps, right?&nbsp; I know this is all very pointless, but I feel the need to rant about awesome things I come across.&nbsp; Also, Walter, the butler, is also known as the 'Angel of Death', and has the ability to spin threads from his fingers&nbsp;which can cut right through flesh and bone!&nbsp; Isn't that the coolest thing ever?&nbsp; Not to mention the gigantic gun that Seras recieves, which u
