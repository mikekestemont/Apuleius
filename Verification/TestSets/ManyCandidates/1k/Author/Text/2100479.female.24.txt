No more deadlifts.  At least, not with the bar, maybe using dumbbells.  For some reason, I cannot stand up without feeling like I am going to loose my balance, which causes my form to go down the drain.  I think it has something to do with the way I stand.  When I am in a natural (for me) standing position, me feet are kind look like this \ / except the left foot is more out, and the right foot is just a smidge more in.  Or, perhaps, that is not abnormal, and I just need to get on lighter weights.  I suppose I can try lighter weights next time, and if I still can't do it, then switch to dumbbells.  Also, today was archery practice.  We shot for about an hour and a half before the workout.  I shoot a 35 lb. recurve with wooden arrows.  Just for the record, I moved off of the 20 yard target to the 30 yard target, and only missed the butte once.  Huzzah!   Food Consumption: Coffee with sugar and coffeemate Reuben and Fries Fry Sauce (about 2 tbs) Iced Tea Carrot Cake Taco Bell - beef grilled stuffed burrito, big soft taco water, lots of it  Hmm, I have a thing for desserts this week.  O-well.
Panda and I are supposed to go to the exercise machine store sometime this week.  I really want a stationary bike, so that I can do some cardio on the non-weight days.  In other news, I am really starting to like the way I look.  I have noticed that I don't feel the need to pull in my stomach on a regular basis, and when I catch a glimpse of myself in a mirror, I am not frowning.  Yay!

Apparently, when you do these things correctly, the weight you can lift drops significantly.  It was mildly depressing, until I got to the last three exercises, and  noticed that on two of them, I had to increase the weight.  Yay!  And, because I went to 12 on those, I actually need even more weight on there!  Panda said I should be sitting from 6-10 reps, except for the dips.    Food consumption: 1 egg, over-hard 1 waffle with butter and syrup coffee with sugar and coffeemate Taco Bell - 3 hard shell tacos Maxx recovery drink, grape (yuck!) Lots of water

I had to improvise some of today's exercises.  I don't think it did as good a job as last time, but I do feel that I got a decent workout.

Food Consumption: Slim Fast shake 2 cups of coffee with sugar and coffeemate - I should note that I am leaving at least 1/4 of this in the cup by the end of the morning. Frisco patty melt hashbrowns with american cheese cherry turnover Iced tea Cobb salad w/bleu cheese dressing Iced tea bloody mary 4 nutter butter cookies Lots of water  I've been craving sweets lately.  I think it has something to do with walking past a bakery every morning this week.
Food Consumption:  2 cups coffee with 2 tsp sugar and coffeemate water (I kept forgetting to drink my Slim Fast) Pizza - equivalent of 2 large slices (hence the pig-out at lunch) Iced Tea Steak with a corn fritter and white gravy.

Today I did 30 minutes of dying, I mean, medium exertion on a stationary bike.  During the workout I felt out of shape and fat, but afterwards, I felt really great!
