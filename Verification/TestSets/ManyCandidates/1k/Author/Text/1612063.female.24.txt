Note to Canadians:  urlLink DON'T EAT YOUR BALLOTS
Looks like one of the twins from Good Charlotte is slumming it with Hilary Duff. Photo  urlLink here .  In other news... DMX was arrested for trying to steal a car apparently.
Guess what! SPIN's very own Chuck Klosterman will be doing a fun-filled book tour. Expect to find him in a city near you very soon. And if he's not in your city, then you should drive to a city that he'll be in. It's worth it.  Also, he's going on tour to promote his book "Sex, Drugs, and CoCo Puffs," which is now available in  urlLink paperback .  Here are his tour dates:   THE 2004 "WHEELS OF CONFUSION" TOUR  July 12th, 7:00pm  - Joseph Beth (Cleveland) July 13th, 7:00pm - Ruminator Books  (Minneapolis)* July 15th, 7:30pm - Powell's Books (Portland) July 19th, 7:30pm - Elliott Bay Book Company (Seattle) July 20th, noon  - Real Networks Corporate reading (Seattle) July 21st, 7:30pm - Cody's Books (San Fran) July 22nd, 7:00pm - Green Apple Books (San Fran) July 23rd, noon - Virgin Corporate "Lunchbox Hero" experience (LA) * * July 23rd, 7:30pm - Skylight Books  (LA) July 27th, 7:30pm - Barnes & Noble (Astor Place) (NYC)
For those wondering...  STELLASTARR* AFTERPARTY @ MANAHATTA (316 BOWERY @ BLEECKER)  I go on at 2:30am. DJs Mike Williams and Electro Greg will be holding fort with the mighty rock and roll until i get there and drink you under the tables. Wait. I wont be drinking.
Holy shit, that post seemed like a paid advertisment from A Drug Free America or  something.  Drugs are great. Booze is fantastic. I miss them both and i plan on reaquainting myself with them shortly. There's nothing like dancing to Blondie when the lights are all over the place and you're totally loaded and you're not preoccupied with the fact that your coordination and balance stopped existing the day you grew two big boobies.
OK! So sobriety is so much easier after the first week, which is why I didnt update this on tuesday or wednesday. Let's see, monday night I did nothing, but doing nothing was fun because it meant that I could sit at home and watch tv. Tuesday night I went to the Viscious party at Sin-e (after getting dinner with Maureen, Lizzy and Tracey at Steak Frites) with my brother Lawrence. I went to check out a band or two -- all saddle creekers -- but got bored and spent most of the time outside chit chatting. Audrey told me how the first five times i met her i never remembered who she was because i was so drunk ... which is terribly embarassing because i fucking love her. I gotta say, this sobriety thing is an eye opener of sorts. Even though I was thinking of jumping off the wagon tomorrow, I think i might hold out a bit longer because i feel a fuck load better and probably look healthier, not to mention I remember shit.   Last night i went to Lollapalooza. Totally great. That's all.   Today my wonderful dear friend Barry comes to NYC. He's scottish, i dont think he's ever met a sober person in his life.   Tomorrow is stellastarr*, elefant, and Yeah Yeah Yeahs... PLUS I'm DJing the ss* after party. I'm definitely gonna stay sober until I get to the party, this way i can actually accomplish something.
I had a very lazy sunday at home. Did some house work, ate a lot, and rummaged online for a bit in an effort to learn something educational. Tonight I will buy rock and roll underwear from Victoria's Secret, then watch TV.  Bert from the Used was supposed to call so i can interview him, and surprise, surprise, he didn't. I think he could use a sobriety blog as well.  This week will be busy for me, but not as bad as usual:  Tuesday i'm seeing the 22s at Pianos, then heading to Sin-e for a very special Viscious party so i can see that guy from Calla perform. Wednesday it's probably Lollapalooza, but i should probably decide on that already. Thursday it's a knitting circle with the Bilderberg media group. then the Vue and then the Witnesses. ... or wait, was the knitting cirlce moved? Friday, it's stellastarr* and Elefant! And my friend Barry is coming to town. He's scottish.
I'm still sober kids. Last night i was supposed to go to alex's party but bailed out on it in favor of watching SNL and sleeping before midnight. I feel bad about not hanging out with Raphael and Adam like i said i would, but going out is hard when Alcohol is not only calling your name, it's shouting it while promising you an oasis of hot young men who want to dance all night long... ONLY IF YOU'RE DRUNK.    I did get dinner with Lance, which was nice. We ate at Suba.   Cheers Queers.
OK. So i had a sip of wine at dinner. My body literally shook. I think it's really starting to hate me for not drinking and is totally freaking the fuck out.  urlLink Raphael  and I are going to a party tomorrow night at  urlLink Alexander  and  urlLink Ryan's  place and I was thinking "i should invite Raph over to drink a bit before we head out to party." and then i remembered that i couldnt do that because sobriety wil continue until august 1.
Here are photos from Paul's birthday party: http://homepage.mac.com/thebigpa/turning_32/  I think that in one of the photos i'm cuddling the drink menu.
OK. I think my body is like "yo, bitch, where the booze at?" Tonight I have to have a sip of wine at Shabbat dinner. OK, maybe since it's for religious reasons I'll make it a gulp of wine.
Holy fucking shit. I managed to go out to a club, DJ, and not have a single drop of alcohol DESPITE the endless amount of drink tickets. Holy crapola. This was after Paul's birthday dinner, and also after the Distillers show which i ended up missing by 15 minutes.  No boozy booze for me. God was it boring.
OK. M
