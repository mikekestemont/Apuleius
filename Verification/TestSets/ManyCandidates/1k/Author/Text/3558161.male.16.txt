Stumbling down These lonely roads Searching around Nowhere to go  Groping the night Nothing to hold Everything's lifeless Nowhere to go  Fighting the shadows Abandoned and tied Descend the ladder To where darkness thrives.  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  A fallen soldier  Still fights for his life  He's just getting colder  He's losing the fight.  It's all just a game  I know what it's like.  Lift you up  Held above to see all  This glorious city  Is going to fall.  These blissful waters  Will be awoken to fear  Kick in the door  Seeking your answers  When there are none to be found  Take my hand  And see where I lead  You suffocate the world  And act a breath of air  I fight for reform  And stand as stone.   I won't miss a beat  'Cause I never, never have before.
Who will be there? I sure will.  This isn't being fabricated into something it's not, there's always going to be something standing up, challenging what I am capable of.  And I will meet it full force, never wavering, never faltering, never stopping, slowing or stalling.  And if you read this, and you wonder what the challenge is,  You'll probably soon find out.  :)  >>>  Try.
Always must be something to butt heads.  A new challenge is always rising to the occasion.  So would you like to test this?  Would you like to see what I can take?    I can handle anything.
In the land of dirt and plaster Lies an army of a thousand nowhere kids Losing ground and falling faster Into a life that no one should have to live  We are the people that you hate We are the bastards that you created (the fucking bastards that you created) A generation with no place A generation of all your sons and daughters  Behind the fake family image Behind the smile of a thousand moms and dads Inside the cage that we've been given I see an image of the future that we don't have  And what did you expect ... a perfect child? Raised by tv sets ... abandoned every mile We never get respect ... never a fair trial  No one gives a shit ... as long as we smile
I'm working on a long CD. 80 Minutes to be exact, and I'm still formulating what to put on it. You know what I mean if you're reading this and you understand.  Also, I find it funny that not caring is a crime, but caring is as well. Can't try to help, but if you shy away and give someone space, then you never cared at all.  Funny how these things work...  Can you say 'Lose-Lose situation'?   Otherwise, things are going amazingly, amazingly good. I'm going to be driving a lot, Mom and Dad are taking me out, and then I'll have my license... and  THEN , you and I will be able to get away.
Please hold. I'm writing a book.   No, really. But you won't get to see it, only one of you.    How can you stand to attempt this This severing? Is it Romeo and Juliet? Do you think we'll give up? Do you think true love Can be torn like this? Do you think I'm the same? Am I just another lie?  Let me tell you now That I'm not even close I'm disgusted By those who judge me And I pity them   Pity is hate.    ES - I Love You
For once, things are going well, and I actually don't have any feeling that they're going to start going bad. This is something I have _NEVER_ experienced before.  I'm wondering what the future holds  And I'm wondering who, if anyone reads this. I've given the link, but I'm sure it's been long lost and long forgotten. After all, these are just the ramblings of Alex Arsenault.  Not to say this negatively, but it seems people have always thought of me as a lesser form of a human, when in reality, they don't know that I'm quite the opposite.  And when they get a chance to figure that out, they don't.  Because they don't want to know!  :P Don't worry, I'm in a good mood still, I don't give a fuck who reads this  or  what they think. Well... unless it's positive of course. I never get comments :'(
This layered storm Raging in the path it wants Leaves everything And nothing behind Unconditionally Yet, chooses only the most beautiful of neighborhoods To demolish.  Do you truly feel  no  remorse?  Do you ever feel guilty for what you've done? For what you're doing? Can you really push through that blindly, not caring that so many know who you are?  When you read this, are you reading because you  care ?  Are you reading this because you want to know if you still have sway? Pull? Power?  Sadly mistaken. Mind games have not been played on anyone's part but yours.  Believe what you want, and force others' hands, not mine.  For this force is stronger than you will  ever  be.  EVER.    These are not riddles. These are statements. Riddles ask questions, and there are none to be asked but 'Why do you do this?'    For a second I wish the tide Would swallow every inch of this city As you gasp for air tonight  I'd scream this song Right in your face if you were here  And I won't Miss a beat 'Cause I never Never have before   Strong arms will turn weak Those eyes will fade; they already are. Dulling into gray, into darkness Giving in to what thrives  You feed carelessly Ever wonder If you've met a wall You can't break through?  That you can't knock down? Ever wonder if there is a mind that does not waver? That this individual can  fight ? Ever wonder if you'd encounter a battle that you can't win? A battle that uses no physical might?   You ruin the best.
It's when dark things hide in the shadows while I'm walking home alone And jump out of the shrubbery and trees And overtake me And they smother me And t
