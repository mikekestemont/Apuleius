It is an art to hide.  Do not ask how I know this, just accept it as a given variable.  Consider the evidence; clothing is considered fashionable, and artsy.  What are you doing by wearing clothing but hiding your beutifull body?  It is NOT fashionable therefore to be naked, so, why is it clothing over the generations (especially for females) has become less and less evident.  In fact evidence of clothing is extremely hard to find off of nudists or their beaches.      From this we(I) can derive nudists are never artists, and therefore artisic mediums should be witheld from them(a terrible waste of resources otherwise).  I am deeply sorry for all nudists everywhere if I have offended you, but I beg you to proove me wrong nudists.  Send me, John Molloy, all your best nudist art(I'm sure it will not be worthy of interpretation).      Where have I gone?  Back to the topic.  How NOT to be seen.       1.  Use a bush to hide behind.      2.  Use two bushes to hide behind.      3.  Use three bushes to hide behind.      4.  Do not use more than three bushes however, or nudism will ensue.      5.  Use clothing(or scars).      6.  Do not even consider other places to hide.       So there you(I) have it, the art of NOT being seen.  Please partake all non-mudists, in this art, wherever or whenever you see fit.    PS. I'll be in Italy from July 28-June 17, don't expect anything from me within that time.
Marijuana is a devious thing in that it is omnipotent in subcultures requiring a certain lack of regard for those beings incapable of thought that refers to substance abuse as a good thing. Whoops, here comes the train of thought, last stop is the smot pokers! Among undescribable and obscene things today is the invisible presence of evidence of substance abuse in certain areas. It is clear that Ralph working at the record store is not puffing the magic dragon although the area has a distinct herbal scent. Could this have been caused by a bath soap? Methinks that a theory is in the works here. Smoke drifts skyward. People toke in dark, low places. When ganja smoke particles gain more energy the smoke becomes less dense and drifts upward. Convection applies and gives the area smoke. Could the offshoot of ganja smoke become a liquid and saturate the air in a record store? Methinks yes. This leads me to believe that numerous people die each year in Ontario as a result of drowning as a result of hotboxing too much and saturating the air with the burnings of substance abuse. In order for such drownings to occur, the air would have to be SUPER-SATURATED. It is also my theory that Buffalo Springfield was a victim of the super-saturation of air as a result of massive substance abuse. There was a death caused once when a man stuck his head inside a functioning bong. Allegedly, the fumes burned his face off. It is my belief that the air inside the bong in question was super-saturated. In conclusion, I would like to warn you that hotboxing crazy detergent marijuana may result in an undesirable pH level. In case you did not pay attention in grade 8 gym class, marijuana bought off the street contains high levels of cleaning products which are strong bases. Super-saturated air as a result of extremely basic pH errrrb smoke is hazsardous to your health in a similar way to drinking a bottle of Tide. So remember kids, stay away from drugs and wear a lifejacket when you hotbox.
I am one.  Hopefully, all of you are too.  I have two arms, and two legs(possibly three), and two eyes.  In fact most good things come in twos.  How do I know this?  THE PRACTICLE APPLICATION OF MATH!  On the piece of paper on which I exist(the planet Earth), the number of body parts I have are tallied neatly.  1 leg + 1 leg + 1 arm + 1 arm + 1 head + 1 body = John, 2 leg + 2 arm + 1 head + 1 body=John. Wow look at that.  John is algebra(push-up fungi[disregard this set of brackets]).  Now, for as long as I exist on paper, I will continue to eat trees to sustain myself.  WHO ARE YOU TO INFRINGE ON MY ALTERNATIVE LIFESTYLE??? *froths at mouth*...*begins to rip pants then reconsiders and continues frothing instead*.    Trees are cut for a reason.  That reason is math.  Forget all that was said, math is evil.  Math is depleting my stock of trees.  Less trees=Less alternative lifestyle.  Math is Anti-Gay!  Math is Anti-Tree eating!  As long as math survives the ways of the courageous tree eater will be lost forever forever in the sands of the nude beach.  For when there are no trees left, math will be dead, the tree eater will again have to eat giant insects, and nudists will rule the world.  That is the plan of the Nudists, do math to destroy trees, to make the entire world a nude beach!  So remember all of you, continue to eat trees, do no math, and curse all nudists until they abandon their plans for world domination and become docile non-math doing tree eaters once again.  Thank you and good-bye.
Deep philosophical questions have been entering my brain concerning the topic of creation of human beings. The age old question is one that I choose to tackle before your very eyes. The meaning of life?! I sat there today as I wrote the science exam and I found myself thinking about a blog comment in particular made by the right honourable Christopher Martin. He mentioned something about math being something that doesn't apply to real life. Lisa Munro made a suggestion that math is 100% on paper and does not exist otherwise. This brings me to ponder the point of our existence: Are we only existing on paper? I feel like there are two identities placed on a person. That person's physical entity is the first, but the second is much more i
