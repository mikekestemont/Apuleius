Well today I cleaned house for a while. And then Laura invited my sisters and I to go to Fairfax pool because her Spanish friend Marta was exiling her. But we couldn't leave until a parental got home, which is dumb. So we didn't get there until Laura and Marta were leaving! What's the point? I'll tell you what the point is! To stay there for 4 hours, hang out with Erin Loree, work on my approach with lifeguard/madrigal and former diver Mandy A., and to help my sister build up the courage to go down the slide and swim by herself in the   deep water!   Overall, I'd say it was quite the fun time. But I've had way more than my fair share of chlorine today, and Lauren will be at diving tomorrow! Yey! So I should probably hit the sack. That was short, and not too sweet either. John is moving to Israel???? Or France . . . Or Germany . . . oh whatever, the kid can't hold on to a thought for more than year anyway. I'm excited to see what he does do with his life after he's been tormenting me with this dream switching business for 3 years. So . . . see you later aligator! Au revoir!

Fumbling his confidence  And wondering why the world has passed him by  Hoping that he’s bid for more than arguments  And failed attempts to fly, fly   We were meant to live for so much more  Have we lost ourselves?  Somewhere we live inside  Somewhere we live inside  We were meant to live for so much more  Have we lost ourselves?  Somewhere we live inside   Dreaming about Providence And whether mice or men have second tries  Maybe we’ve been livin with our eyes half open  Maybe we’re bent and broken, broken   We want more than this world’s got to offer  We want more than this world’s got to offer  We want more than the wars of our fathers  And everything inside screams for second life
Yeah, well you know what I said yesterday about breaking away from the idiot thing??? I lied. Today was horrid. Sometimes I'm not really sure why I'm such a loser, but I absolutely love it. Like, when can I just figure it out? I'm not sure if I'm just kidding myself that I might get better at diving someday, or if I just love doing it so much that I don't care. I always feel like I'm trying, but if I loved diving as much as I thought I did, then why can't I do a freaking back dive???? AAAARGH! And I don't mean to be all woe is me and unpleasant, but for crying out loud! Remember the inwards I was so excited about? Today I couldn't even remember how to do them, and my mind kept thinking about a zillion other things the whole time I was on the board. Then I would do my press (still thinking I was going to nail it) and jump . . . and fall. No dive whatsoever. I feel like crap, like crap that can barely stand up without it's legs shaking. If you've never felt that, it's really really annoying. Especially when you are balancing on the edge of a diving board. So . . . ugh.   In other news::: Sam got back from Costa Rica today. Lauren is still on the missing person's list. Maria is going to get her cast off in like an hour. She also learned how to toot on her clarinet which is about as beautiful as a dying owl. :)I think Laura wants to do something today, but I'm not really in the mood. I wish Cecilia would call me sometime this millenium. Hint Hint Miss Fisher. AND . . . joy of all possible joys . . . MY AUNT AND BOYFRIEND UNCLE RECENTLY PURCHASED A VERY EXPENSIVE LITTLE BOX THAT I SWORE I WOULDN'T TELL ANYONE ABOUT SO I'M NOT REALLY TELLING YOU THIS OKAY?? BUT MARIA AND I ARE THE ONLY ONES CLEVER ENOUGH TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS. Christy I was thinking mauve for the dresses . . . what do you think? ;) hehe. Well, adios people!
Heyya, I'm super excited! I did 3 inward dives off the high dive today!! Whoooohooooo! And on the third one I smacked so hard I bruised my thigh! haha! I also got full twisting somersaults! This year is going to rock so much because I think I've finally broken out of my "idiot on a diving board stage". Derrick (my coach) even said that I look a
