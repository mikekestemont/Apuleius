I often wonder the alterior motives of women who come out to the Backporch.  Of course this is a broad generalization, and there are always exceptions.  Moving right along...  Tonight there was a trio of ladies that sashayed into the bar about 11:30.  All three of them were fairly attractive, but at the same time it seemed they were trying way too hard to impress what I like to call the 'invisible element'.  One of them I recognized as one of the vetran dancers from Paulo's over on Fisher Street.  The other two seemed like they had been yanked right out of their freshman year, and poured into the uniform of the street walkers.  The blonde one had been really gutsy and was sporting a pair of black, vinyl, 5" silletto thigh high boots.  Amusingly enough, she looked realistic enough...if that's the look she was going for...until she started walking, or trying to.  Inevitatbly they garnered quite a bit of attention.  Unfortunately, I think they got a bit more than they expected, and from an unwanted audience.  To my way of thinking, if you wanted a particular type of audience, you'd target them and then reel them in to do...whatever it was they wanted to do.  I couldn't help but laugh when boot girl stumbled over to Bane to ask him to remove a table of regulars for harrassing her.  -Harrassing- her!  It was ridiculous.  Of course he turned her request down, after explaning to her rather bluntly that if she didn't want to be stared at, she might try some less reflective attire.  By this time I was bent over with laughter.  Of course I felt her pain...not really but I'm not really a cold heartless bitch.  The regulars she had attracted probably consisted of more ink and metal than blood and flesh, but we can't go judging based on appearance now can we?  Now who needs reality tv?
I was late for work last night.  I wasn't exactly moonlighting, but I can never turn down an opportunity to make a few extra bucks.  I was coming from the University and subsequently the library, researching ways to get myself back into grad school, when I was stopped by a carousing group of what were obviously Frat guys.  I should have remembered it was initiation night.  John, the guy who has decided to pay for his friends and be initiated into that antiquated circle of male homosocial bonding, stopped me and asked me to join them.  I was blunt, but pleasant and sweet.  I had to work and Myra was already going to chew me out.  I decided to at least make it worth it.  We bantered for about ten minutes and finally they asked where I was heading, I told them I was on my way to work at Hades Backporch. they agreed to stop by later and John slid his arm around my waist, "claiming" me.  When will guys ever learn?   I returned the hug enthusiastically and let my hands wander seductively as I backed away toward the cab.  His friends whistled and they headed to the next bar.  I couldn't help but laugh out loud, the Cabbie checking me out in the rearview mirror just to make sure I wasn't decorating my entire face with lipstick and rolling my eyes in the back of my head.  We were about a block from Hades when I opened John's wallet.  Bingo.  At least three hundred dollars.  I'd say it was worth it.  He'd never know either.  The brothers would be buying and he wouldn't realize his wallet was gone until he woke up with a hangover.  God I love my job sometimes.  I winked and smiled at Bane as I entered the bar, making sure to brush up against those muscles of his.  I don't know what it is, but there's something sexy about tall quiet handsome muscular men.  I appologized on the run to Myra, jumping behind the bar immediately, already taking orders from a group of suits.  Suits are good.  They tip well, and well... Who doesn't have a Pretty Woman Fantasy brewing inside her?  I didn't have to fake my giddiness last night, I was raking in the dough.  I will say that I was a little off put when the frat guys showed up.  Myra took care of them, making thm feel more important than their little greek letters actually made them.  I hustled back and forth between tables and the bar, smiling, winking and genuinely enjoying my job, when I noticed Myra come from around the bar.  Man she is not someone I want to mess with.  I knew that since the first night she hired me.  That's why we get along so well.  Anyway, she was busy setting them straight while I was smiling at a delicious thing with blonde hair and ocean blue eyes in a suit when I heard the word Bitch directed at Myra.  I shuffled down the bar slightly and my hand went to a crowbar we just happened to have there (HOW it got there I'l never know).  I managed to continue to take orders when Myra launched in on the guy, in front of his friends no less.  I couldn't hold in the laughter and the rest of the bar errupted into applause and laughtr as the guys were litterally tossed out by Bane and Raph.  I knew I'd like this chick when I first met her.    I knew then that I had no reason to feel guilty that night.  I left with a huge roll of tips, Jackass Johnny's wallet and I even got a card from a suit.  Sometimes I just love my job.
Last night I was working the early bar shift.  I was on my own until Victoria came on at eleven thirty.  Of course the usual girls, Tamika and Jenn were working, along with Bane and Raphael.  About ten o'clock a group of seven guys wandered in.  They didn't appear to be troublesome, actually they looked like a lineup of freshman having wandered off c
