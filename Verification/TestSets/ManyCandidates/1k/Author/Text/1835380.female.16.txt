Goodbye Beautiful Friend   And everything goes spinning off again. Why can't things just stay the same. For their own good. Actually I think Im someone who likes things to change, but I prefer just a bit slower. There could be many things that Im talking about now, and Im not quite sure which one Im refering to. I think it's just safe to say that because Im growing up- because we're all growing up- things change. They get better or they get worse. I suppose Im just a lucky little girl and things usually end up great for me. Sort of like some sitcom/after-school-special where the main character (being myself) makes a mistake or learns something new, but everything turns out better for it (she learns her lesson).  Ever heard of a midlife crisis? I think I will never go through one. I've done all my "identity checking" already-or it seems that way. Sometime I will make a graph. A graph that shows CHANGE IN A PERSON vs AGE. How quickly the line will go up when we're young. Then it will slow down as we're older and we've all found out where we belong. Until then (this will sound very cliche) we will all continue to play the roles of different people until we've found one that we're comfortable in.  I think I'm getting closer .  It seems that my life is a sitcom. I have always thought that. The only difference is that I hear no laugh track when I say something funny. Or maybe there is an audience, but nothing funny ever happens. I would like my life to  be a musical. Like Renee Zellweger in Chigago (More like Chicog-DONT-go). This weekend I dressed up for my cousin's wedding in Kingston. My dress was beautiful. It was all the more lovely because I just love to get dressed up. If I had it my way, we would all where dresses and tuxes to school. There were tonnes of hot army guys there (cuz is in the good ol miltary), but unfortunely they we completely hammered and were hitting on other not-so-sober girls (not me). I can't wait to get married. The girl my cousin married is only 18. 18!. that would be like me getting married in three years! I can't imagine that. But she is a very mature girl and I really like her.  As of right now I am just exhausted. For the past week I have not had more than 7 hours sleep each night- Unlike the rest of the summer which was maybe 12 a night. Every day I've had to get up early and go somewhere or do something which requires me getting up early. I just got home from kingston maybe an hour ago and i need sleep. I will sleep after Im done writing. Im not often in a writing mood and when I am, I must ramble on and on until my thoughts run dry, and then after that, I will most likely find something else to write (or talk) about.       I havent seen many people from school this summer. That sucks. But I will see them all on Tuesday. Until then everyone, Stephanie needs to sleep, so keep on truckin and stay in school. -Love me
This is just too much fun to be legal. Seriously guys, I recommend everyone to get a blog. Another thing that I found amusing today while I was surfing my way along the information highway was  urlLink this  . It completely reminds me of being in  urlLink Senegal . I mean those Iraqi people have a better sense of humour than we give them credit for (number 2, read number 2). They're also a lot more resourceful than us  urlLink incongruous  North Americans. My uncle went to Iraq 2 weeks ago for work (I'm not quite sure exactly what he does) and when he came back I watched a video that he made while visiting. I think the coolest thing I saw on it was that the American soldiers let the Iraqi kids paint some of their army tanks. There was lots of other crazy stories but by now I forget them all. Something having to do with oil and or gasoline most likely.   Tonite I am dying my hair. What IS the magic shade? well you are just going to have to find out... Stay tuned -Love me  urlLink )"  title="Comments by SquawkBox.tv"> javascript:SquawkBoxCount( )
I like 80's cover bands as much as the next person, but that just wasn't the link I was looking for. Go easy on me, it's my first day -Love me
"Guys, are we going to be like our parents when we grow up?" One of my alltime favourite movies,  urlLink the breakfast club  .I don't know which character I'm most like, but in the movie, all of them worry about becoming their parents... Now don't get me wrong, cos I absolutely love my parents, but... Have you ever heard the phrase  "I love you, but do I like you?" . Well I might say this phrase came into play this weekend while watching my parents with other people. hmm. I still have some things to work out with them. But I do have pride in the fact that I get along with them better than most people (or I guess, teenagers) get along with their's.   "This summer's out of reach".  Ouch. Well i guess I still have a week left, but at the beginning I had a huge mother of a list of things to do this summer. I don't think I actually wrote it down, but it was considered a mental list. I think the only thing that I actually got around to doing was "learning to play guitar" (if you can actually call what i do with that thing playing). I'm no Santana, but I do play a mean Ode to joy.   Oh yeah for those of you who are just joining... us (me?).... this is my boomin new blogger. Now for a limited time only, t
