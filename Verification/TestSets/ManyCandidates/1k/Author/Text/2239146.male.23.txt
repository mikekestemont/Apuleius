This Blog will include prophetic words from many of the members of TAG (the awakening generation).  These words may cover a variety of topics & be addressed to a variety of audiences, from a word for the Church* in our area, to the Church of America.  (*Please note that by Church we refer to the body of Christ, being every person who has accepted Jesus as their saviour and in any way is pursuing a relationship with him).  We are called the Nameless & Faceless Generation because we strive to be those who will Give all the Glory to God our Father, and keep nothing for ourselves.  Our goal is to make greater His Fame and Glory.     Feel free to share the information you read here with other people as you desire.

God is calling this Generation to not only be the Generation that steps into the promised land, but the Generation that restores the faith, the confidence, and the accountability into the office of the prophet.  Once again, those anointed by God to wear the mantel of the prophet will become sought after by elected officials for direction, guidance, and/or advice.  This Generation will hold itself accountable for the words they speak.  This Generation will step-up and confess any flesh that seeped into the words God gave them.  This Generation will restore the office of the prophetic.  It is this Generation that the prophetic  must  because it is  this  Generation that is lead the battle to retake land that has been held within the enemies grasps for so long.  But remember this Generation, remember that you must walk with your eyes looking towards heaven, towards God.  Remember this Generation, that you must remain as humble as Moses.  Remember this Generation, I have called you to be a uniting factor for all generations on this earth.  You cannot...you  will not  do this alone.   You require the wisdom that I will impart unto you, you require the wisdom of those whom I have placed around you.  Do not become complacent or prideful in what I have given you, for you will surely fall if you do.  Surrender yourself to Me and I will continue to build you up, I will continue to use you to speak My Word to this Nation, all Nations.  I am calling you to restore the faith in the prophetic, for it is this prophetic that will be integral to the battle that must be won on earth.
There is coming a great movement of the Holy Spirit to the church.  There is a great outpouring coming from the heavens onto not only My church, but the whole world.  This outpouring of My Spirit is coming very suddenly and, unfortunately, a great number of My people will not prepared.  In fact some won't even think that this outpouring is of Me, this will cause an unexpected division many people will leave churches looking for something not as extreme, and that is what they will find. My children, do not focus on this division because it is because of My Spirit, yes MY SPIRIT, and after this seperation in the church there will be a massive increase.  You may even find that there will be even more numbers in the church than before.  The oncoming outpouring is about to bring a release to many in the church who are under bondages, and I am releasing the ministers of My Word to speak freely to the broken hearts, and I will heal them once again.  Do not focus on the division or the people who leave, but instead focus on Me, and prepare yourself so that you don't sit by idley and search for something without My Spirit.   Focus on Me only  and you'll only see the profit of and the good of this mighty movement.
God is calling His children to wake up and shake off our Apathy-  ------  It is by My choosing, I tell you, that I allow you, My children, to choose.  You may choose Me, or not.  Once you have chosen Me, you set the pace.  It is you who decides how quickly you grow in Me.  I do not force myself upon you.  I woo you.  I call to you because I long to be with you.  Can't you see that all you have to do is ask?  I'll give Myself you- up to the amount that you desire.  I am not angry with you, my children.  This is a lie of the enemy.  I have always wanted you.  Ask for Me, I'm so glad to give myself to you.  ------  The Lord is willing to reveal himself.  "Ask and you'll receive." When you earnestly seek, He pours himself out.  He is saying to us--  These are serious times.  You cannot afford to wait until later to grow in me.  Come now and you will find what you seek.  I am preparing to pour out wisdom, maturity, and my gifts upon those who desire Me.  Live as though the tomorrow that You will see will be the last- because you don't know!  My signs, wonders and miracles will be poured out through the seekers, and many will wonder.  Many will be afraid.  Many will turn.  But there will be multitudes that will come and believe.  And those who labor now are building my bridge- that which will be made from the hard work and labor of my children will act as a pass for those new workers to come across and into deep intimacy with Me at much greater ease than those who built for years.  In this, I say, REJOICE!  For the Kingdom of God is for all who come.  Your reward is me, you laborers.  Do not turn your eyes from Me and your brothers in these times.  I am your sufficiency. ---  pray for & prefer one another.  Lift each other up. because God is Love.  amen.
