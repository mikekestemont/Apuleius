i am starting anew.
i remember now!!! so little alyssa got her top braces on today. poor kid. shes od'ed on kiddie aspirin already today. lol. theyre bright pink. and in all different places because her teeth are sooo crooked. shes going to be gorgeous when her teeth are all straight. shes so funny. shes been smiling all day, not realizing just how funny it looks. lol.
so swim meet tonight. this is the first one that ive actually somewhat enjoyed. though my races sucked. but so for the last race-the 200 meter freestyle relay, i wasnt initially supposed to be in the race. ashley comes running up to me, because she thought that i was swimming with them. but it was actually this girl claire that was supposed to be swimming. but claire is deathly slow. they asked me if i'll swim on their team instead of claire. so we ask the coach (who my dad is fully convinced is gay) and he says its okay. then we ask this girl claire, and she seems fine with it. so we're waiting for it to be our turn to race, and we see claire, crying. omg we all felt sooo bad. but they really wanted to win. lol. and we did, we won. and the coach even said that i had an 'awesome swim.' made me happy. lol. but i still feel bad. maybe ill give her my donut tomorrow...nah. krispy kreme...too good to waste.
"A 16-year-old Leo High School student died Saturday evening in a two-car crash on Garman Road in northern Allen County, Indiana State Police said. Lindsay R. Jackson was a passenger in a Chrysler convertible driven by Aaron L. James, 16, of Huntertown. James collided with a vehicle driven by Scott T. Burns, 18, of Auburn, near the intersection of Garman and Hull roads shortly before 8 p.m., state police said. Jackson died at the scene. The Allen County Coroner’s Office determined she died of blunt force trauma to her head and neck, Coroner Dr. E. Jon Brandenberger said. She was wearing a seat belt, but it couldn’t save her life because of the severity of the impact, police said. Burns and James were both hospitalized in fair condition Sunday. James was airlifted to Parkview Hospital with injuries to his face and head. Burns injured his lower leg, police said. Troopers continued to investigate the accident cause Sunday. The vehicles collided head-on as the James car was eastbound and the Burns car was westbound. The collision occurrednear the center of the road, police said."           yeah so what were the assholes doing? thats right-playing chicken. scott and aaron should have been the ones to die, not lindsay. it makes you think about how fragile life really is, and how so many things, even life in general, are taken for granted. lindsay, the only innocent one in the incident, was the one to die. at least scott is 18 and can be tried as an adult. i hope they're brought up on manslughter-and convicted. i hate them both. i did before this, but this has just deepened that so much more. fucking bastards.        its so sad.
oh my god so just found out that lindsay jackson died saturday night oh my god
im kinda nervous right now. ummm so chris called last night wanted me to do something, but i couldn't, and he said he'll probably call tonight to see if i can. but if my parents know hes called 2 days in a row theyre gonna be 'uh oh...' they dont want me hangiong out with guys, but thats stupid because sarah and chelsey had shitloads of guy friends and my parents had no problem with it. but its me and they go spastic. my dad was an ass about collyn calling all the time. its not like theres anything going on with chris, but my parents are still gonna be suspicious. so fucking overprotective.   and i dont wanna do anything with him unless danae is going, so that im more comfortable. and also my parents will probably only let me if danae is going too.&nbsp; so if she cant go, then i need t o make up an excuse. lol. and danae is the same way about it all.    &nbsp;  urlLink  http://www.hometown.aol.com/xoblueangel89xo/memories.html    thats just like a ton of pictures and memories and everything of all of my friends. of all that i've missed. i just about cried looking at it. i miss them so much. they have their pictures from the dance, and i remember looking forward to that so much, and then having missed it and seeing how awesome they all look, how happy they all look. and, dont get me wrong, i like seeing them happy and everything, i just really wish that i were there, that i&nbsp;was part of it all. they all mean so much to me. i need to go back. it would be so awesome even if i went there for like a month, just so that i can see everyone. maybe thats what ill convince my parents to let me do next summer. but god thats a long time away.    &nbsp;  i love you all

just trying something...
oh my god. my mom is being such a bitch. so the kids were upstairs eating, being their usual annoying selves, and i whipped alyssa with the towel. but it didnt actually work, so the towel just kinda flopped, brushing her back as it fell. but of course, she wanted to get me in trouble, so she ran outside and told my mom that i was hitting her. so naturally, madre came inside and starting bitching at me about always fighting with them. what the fuck. okay, i havent fought with them  at all  since sarah moved out, which was quite a while ago. my main source of stress was removed, and i've been doing great. but they fight  all the fucking time  and they're always hitting eachother and shit, and she doesnt do anything about it. what ever happened to all those threats and all those punishments t
