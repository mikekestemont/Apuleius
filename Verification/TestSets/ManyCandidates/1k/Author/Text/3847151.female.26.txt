The July 2004 National Geographic Magazine’s cover is a picture of a female guerrilla labeled  “Cocaine Country” . Although, the reality of most Colombian far away regions is that there is no presence of official institutions and that poor peasants have no other alternative to earn other than growing cocaine leaves, I find this article too shallow and short in describing a complex issue such as drug trafficking and its implications for my country.  I accept that I am speaking from the bottom of my “insulted” Colombian patriotic heart. I think , however, that we have a right to feel this way.    This is what I posted on the  urlLink National Geographic website :&nbsp;   “My father has been a NGM subscriber since the 70’s. During this time, Colombia has never, to my knowledge, been granted a NG cover. As a Colombian, I was greatly affected by the editorial’s decision to inaugurate Colombia as a front cover with an article labeled “Cocaine Country”. I wonder why the Spanish version of NGM has a different cover, the article about the sun, and whether it was a strategy to minimize the controversy this article is generating.   Colombian’s have had to learn to live with an image strongly related to the production of cocaine, and I think this article will reinforce the negative international image that we have tried to deal with for so long. I think no Colombian can deny that cocaine is the most complicated problem in our country, it reflects our inability to attack poverty and inequality. However, front covers like this have the side effect of reinforcing the only internationally recognized characteristic of our society. “
Es viernes y tengo un guayabo horrible. Esto de pretender ser productivo cuando uno tiene la cabeza dando vueltas es un poco pretencioso. Inclusive, debo admitir que hasta escribir esto me esta causando trabajo. Y no sólo es el guayabo físico sino el moral, porque a parte de tomar la no muy inteligente decisión de emborracharme un jueves a punta de aguardiente, también tomé la no muy sabia decisión de no llegar nunca a mi casa. Pero bueno, espero que el efecto de los dos males anteriormente descritos, como siempre, los cure el tiempo.   Ayer conocí a alguien con quien no tuve empatía. Fue muy raro, porque por lo general a mi me cae bien todo el mundo. La verdad acepto que esa persona que conocí sacó a relucir algunas de las inseguridades que tengo sobre las decisiones que he tomado y que voy a tomar en no muy corto tiempo. Y también me hizo acordarme que cada vez es mas difícil conseguir personas con las cuales se está totalmente a gusto. Hay que estar preparado, y tener la certeza que los amigos, aún lejos, son los amigos.   Y para cerrar mi correo favorito de las últimas semanas:  “Trust Me On The Sunscreen   If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it. The long-term benefits of sunscreen have been proven by scientists, whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience.  I will dispense this advice now.  Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth. Oh, never mind. You will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they've faded. But trust me, in 20 years, you'll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked. You are not as fat as you imagine.  Don't worry about the future. Or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum. The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind, the kind that blindside you at 4 pm on some idle Tuesday.  Do one thing every day that scares you.  Sing.  Don't be reckless with other people's hearts. Don't put up with people who are reckless with yours.  Floss.  Don't waste your time on jealousy. Sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind. The race is long, and in the end, it's only with yourself.  Remember compliments you receive. Forget the insults. If you succeed in doing this, tell me how.  Keep your old love letters. Throw away your old bank statements.  Stretch.  Don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your life. The most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives. Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don't.  Get plenty of calcium. Be kind to your knees. You'll miss them when they're gone.  Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't. Maybe you'll have children, maybe you won't.  Maybe you'll divorce at 40, maybe you'll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary.  Whatever you do, don't congratulate yourself too much or berate yourself either. Your choices are half chance. So are everybody else's.  Enjoy your body. Use it every way you can. Don't be afraid of it or of what other people think of it. It's the greatest instrument you'll ever own.  Dance, even if you have nowhere to do it but your living room.  Read the directions, even if you don't follow them.  Do not read beauty magazines. They will only make you feel ugly.  Get to know your parents. You never know when they'll be gone for good.  Be nice to your siblings. They're your best link to your past and the people most likely to stick with you in the future.  Understand that friends come and go, but with a precious few you should hold on. Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle, because the older you get, the more you need the people who knew you when you were young.  Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard. Live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft.  Travel.  Accept certain inalienable truths: Prices will rise. P
