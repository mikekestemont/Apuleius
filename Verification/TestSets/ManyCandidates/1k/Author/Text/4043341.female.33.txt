Hello Everybody!   I think this is way cool. I have missed everyone for so long and think it's great that we are all trying to keep in touch again. I did go to our 10 year reunion thinking I would get to see everyone from our "gang", but nobody! Was there. That was the whole reason I went and so excited about this. Well let me let you in on what's been going on in my life...The short version. I am still working as an RN. I have been in pediatrics the whole time. I have done the pediatric wards and the pediatric ER and now gave up working nights, weekends, and holidays to work at a special needs day care. I love it, but am a little bored, but being bored isn't a bad thing. It's a lot less stress and the kids are great. I did get married in 1993 to a guy who I thought was the best. He decided to like guys instead of girls and we got divorced in 1996. I did some travel nursing for a few years and ended back in Florida. I guess I was meant to be here. I have been here since 1996. I bought a house and then met the most wonderful man in the world....Edison. We just got married June 26th of this year. We have been together for 4 years and this is the one! We have 2 kids....Ha..Dachshund Baxter and Princess. They are our kids for now...Who knows about the future. My parents are still at the same house 15th and Porter Ave. If you are in the neighborhood you should pop in and tell them hello they would love it. I have kept in touch with Amber. I have sent her the web site info and will let her fill you in on her life, but I can tell you that she is happily married and living in North Carolina. Well that is my life in a nut shell and will keep posting as long as everybody else does. Love you guys!    PS.  I did change my name it's now Lisa Torres
Schmer wanted us to post our bios on here, so here is mine. Robert and I have been married since September 6, 2003; hence our new e-mail address:  urlLink robandrobinscott9603@verizon.net    Bob is 47, he works for ISG(formally known as Bethlehem Steel). I work for Life Care Center of Valparaiso, but I am pursuing the Electricians Apprentinceship Program and I am taking classes for a steelmill workers certificate, which ISG wants you to have before they hire you. We have 3 daughters(I don't call them step-children): Sherry is 28, she is a Surg-tech in Chicago. She is married to Ivo(pronouneced Evo) who is from Slovakia and is contracted to paint new houses in the Chi-town area. Heather is 23. She has an Associates in Business through Purdue North Cornfield. She is currently pursuing a degree in Horticulture from the main campus of Purdue. She is going to Greece this fall on a scholarship. Jessie is 22. She is her third year of apprenticeship for the pipe-fitters. She is engaged to Will, who is an apprentice plumber. All 3 girls are trying to have kids, so I may be a grandma soon. Also, Bob and I are trying to have a child. We already have the names picked. If boy, Zachariah Augustus, if twin boys, then the second one will be named: Stephan Micheal James. For our first girl: Catherine Marie, if twin girls the second one will be named: Amber Elisabeth Marie. This is my bio. Hope to hear from everyone soon.
I just got off the phone with Robin - I was sitting here at work and the phone rang and there was this familiar voice on the other end that I couldn't quite place... it's so hard to believe that it's been fifteen years since high school!    It's great to hear what everyone is up to and find out how they've spent those years.  I spoke with Lisa Lorenz on Friday and sent her the invitation to this blog - I think Robin did also, so hopefully she'll be online soon.    Hey - in the "missing list" - how about Mike Butler and Matt Dougherty?  Does anyone know where they are?
Hello to everyone that has posted so far! This is just unbelievable, I am very happy with everyone that I have talk to so far. Mr. Scott is laughing his ass off that we are trying to plan a 15 year get together for the old gang, he hope's we get this planned. Anyway, please keep in touch. Home Phone # 219-464-7085, Cell Phone # 219-916-4946, E-mail (although this will be changing in the next few days) :  urlLink r.scott1@att.net    Let's get this thing going!   Love you all    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robin
Hi, guys! &nbsp; Schmer, thanks for setting up the blog... great idea! &nbsp; Looking forward to reconnecting with everyone - it's been far too long. &nbsp; I'm living in Los Angeles these days.&nbsp; It's definitely an interesting city, but not someplace I'd like to stay indefinitely.&nbsp; After living in Boston&nbsp;during college, I ended up traveling around for a while, living abroad for a bit and then in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and then in Chicago, with Lis Peters.&nbsp; I met my husband of three years John [Luciano] there.&nbsp; We moved to Los Angeles in 2001 to check out the animation scene (John's an animator).&nbsp; I'm the media relations person for a medium-sized university -  urlLink www.lmu.edu . &nbsp; As John's canadian (he's from Toronto), we have to split our time at Christmas in both places, but I'm hoping we can get back to Chicago for at least a couple of days this year. It would be so great to see you all! &nbsp; Melissa Abraham [kept my maiden name, too] 323.654.2512 or cell 310.345.8698 (hey, since I have to have it for work, might as well use it for fun, too!)  &nbsp;
Okay Schmer-a-licious, &nbsp; This is my "maiden posting..."&nbsp; Just wanting to see if I c
