Two of film history's greatest actors Meryl Streep and Robert DeNiro can be seen in this subtle drama about falling in love with someone outside wedlock      This is far from a great movie, but to totally discard it is also wrong. What I liked about this movie is that it really tries to look into the actual conflict a person excperience when he or she finds themselves in love with someone else than their husband or wife.  The acting is what makes this movie good, Meryl Streep is sublime as Molly Gilmore and Robert DeNiro does very well in one of his few straight forward romantic lead. The sreenplay is somewhat underwritten, but the actors really sparkle without much more help than their talents.
India's most famous fairytale put on the screen in this huge Bollywood production
Norwegian superstar Sissel's first true attempt to break into the international charts is a smooth and relaxing encounter.       It all seemed to   work out for Sissel in the mid-90s with her excelent performance with Placido Domingo on the Norwegian Olympic song 'Fire in Your Heart', the Europeen number one hit 'Prince Igor' and singing the soundtrack for 'Titanic', but then the songbird went silent. She had been a superstar in Scandinavia since her debut in 1986 with 'Sissel' and her huge hit 'Love' ('Kjaerlighet'). She is to date the most successful artist to ever come from Norway and no artist has sold more records in Norway than her.   'All Good Things'   is a streamlined pop album with no big highs or lows. What the album can show for is Sissel's trademark; her remarkable soprano voice. Forget Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, Barbara Streisand and other great vocalists, Sissel has one of the most superiour voices in the world, she sings like an angel.

Portishead lead Beth Gibbons joined forces with Rustin Man and released the best album of 2002.       This sober, jazz inspired album is excellent for those cold long winter nights with a glass of red vine and good company. Beth Gibbons’ inhabits an amazing and powerful voice that often is not taken advantage of on Portishead’s releases. There is nothing wrong with her song writing abilities either and this is truly one of those albums that one should have in one’s record collection.
Often overlooked, but really a good comedy. Hawn and long time partner Kurt Russel at their best. Not fresh, nor innovative, but a classical comedy plot and Hawn as dizzy as ever.      This screwball comedy casts real-life couple Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn in a film that finds the latter returning to her roots in a role reminiscent of Private Benjamin (1980). This is Goldie Hawn's film, she sparkles in one scene after another and hence showing why she is amongst the most successful comedians in Hollywood history.  A straightforward comedy, with no original twists and turns, but good wholesome American comedy.
ABBA, maybe the greatest pop act in history, released their last album, ‘The Visitors’, in 1981 and ended 10 years of glory two years later, when they went separate ways.        ABBA had  an incredible run of chart topping hits throughout the latter part of the 70s and in 1980 they released their greatest album ever,the sublime 'Super Trouper&', by many considered the last well-made ABBA album. ABBA was showing new depths on this album, showing them selves capable of making more than catchy pop/disco tunes.    This trend  was taken further on 'The Visitors' and only &#8216;One of Us&#8217;, ABBA&#8217;s last single to enter the UK Top 10, is in the fashion of "classic" ABBA. The rest of the album has dark, melancholic undertones and dealing with obscure topics not associated with ABBA. Maybe the most underrated song on the album is the exquisite 'When all is Said and Done' released after the only major hit on the album 'One of Us', 'When all is Said and Done' is a ballad about an ended relationship, but dealing with the break-up in a more mature and reasonable way compared to the 1981 smash hit 'The Winner Takes it All'.     Other great  tracks on this album is the title track &#8216;The Visitors&#8217; dealing with espionage in the U.S.S.R., &#8216;Soldiers&#8217;  is a song about war and the strange, but catching &#8216;Two for the Price of One&#8217; which is about dating. &#8216;Head over Heels&#8217; was supposed to be a song in the fashion of &#8216;Waterloo&#8217; (their breakthrough single back in 1974), but the cool overall style of the song made it a very melancholic song and totally missed the target. But in retrospect this song has strong qualities    that has been overlooked and deserve a second chance.     Isolation and regret  is two of the major themes on this album, an album that also gives us an idea of what ABBA could have been if they continued recording throughout the 80s. &#8216;The Visitors&#8217; is one of the most underrated albums of its time and shows that ABBA always gave their best when    it came to quality of their songs.    urlLink The Official ABBA Site
