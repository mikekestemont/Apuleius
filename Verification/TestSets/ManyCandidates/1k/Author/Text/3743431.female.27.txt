I have been a pretty unbiased person in regards to Michael Moore's latest film. I even gave it a half-assed positive review, although I was honest in reporting some inaccuracies that I found.  After visiting http://www.moorewatch.com after hearing about the website on the news, I decided to take a wander over there.   It seems the Michael Moore has taken an article about his film, posted it on his site, but removed a sentence or two from the article.  Below is what was written by JimK at Moorewatch.com:   urlLink Mikey Is Afraid of Us - MOOREWATCH - Watching Michael Moore's every move : "Case in point?  Just like we do here, Mike has been reposting articles on his website that pertain to F911.  On this page he reposts the entire text of a column from Canada's CTV News.  Here's the way Mike quotes it.   CTV.CA: Missing Fahrenheit 9/11's Forest for the Trees'  Bill Doskoch, CTV.ca News Staff  Updated: Wed. Jun. 30 2004 5:51 PM ET  Both the critics and the audiences have come out for Fahrenheit 9/11. Pulling in almost $22 million US in its first weekend, the film has set a record for a documentary.  Not surprisingly, the mainstream media has cast a skeptical eye on the left-leaning film. And U.S. conservatives are absolutely apoplectic about it.  Both the mainstream news media and conservative advocates have harped on inaccuracies in the film.  Now, here's the way it appeared on the CTV News website.  Missing Fahrenheit 9/11's forest for the trees  Bill Doskoch, CTV.ca News Staff  COMMENTARY&#65533;Both the critics and the audiences have come out for Fahrenheit 9/11. Pulling in almost $22 million US in its first weekend, the film has set a record for a documentary.  Not surprisingly, the mainstream media has cast a skeptical eye on the left-leaning film. And U.S. conservatives are absolutely apoplectic about it. Check out Moorelies.com or Moorewatch.com to see what I mean.  Both the mainstream news media and conservative advocates have harped on inaccuracies in the film. [Emphasis added]So, even in an article sympathetic to his cause and his message, he feels the need to delete the names of two websites.  As a writer, I am appalled. As a person, I am angry that someone would go to these lengths, as well as, deceive, in my opinion, people who believe in him and his ethics.
The F word has become such a dirty word in our society. It is filled with stereotypes, derogatory remarks, and, in some cases, pure ignorance and hate. Now, I am not talking about THAT F word, I am talking about the word Feminist.  Does anyone actually know what a feminist is? Ask someone and their answers may include the term woman's libber, or a comment about burning bras, or even a comment questioning one's sexuality.  They may believe that being a feminist means you are anti-marriage or anti-name change after marriage. They may believe that being a feminist means that you are men haters or belong to a different era. To some, it means intimidation. To others, it means weakness.  I am a married woman, who took the last name of her husband, has three children, cooks dinner for her family, cooks for her family, and takes care of her family. I stay at home with my children, and for a time of four years, was always barefoot and pregnant. And I am a feminist.  Feminism is believing in social, political, and economical equality for all sexes. Many of you reading this are probably feminist without knowing it. Some of you may hold bad feelings towards feminist, but have wives that hold this belief.   Feminism is just another example of something positive that has been spun by the media to gain the negative stereotypes that it has.  So, the next time someone tells you that feminist hate men, ask them to name one. The next time someone tells you that feminist are the enemy of all women, ask them how, when all feminist really want is to be treated as an equal. You will be surprised at how many individuals will not be able to answer you back.  Be proud of being a woman. Be proud of being a feminist. Stand up for yourself and take back the dirty associations with the word, and show how it is a positive force striving for positive things. And raise your daughters to believe the same things.
Did anyone catch the news blurps on Saddam in court today? What am I thinking? This is America! It was on every channel, every five minutes. Some emphasized his statement that President Bush was the real criminal, some minimized it, not wanting to give him the opportunity to allow anymore anti-bush 'propaganda' or because they are republican-based news sources and didn't want anyone to get wind of what he said, because some people might actually agree with him.  I have to admit to you all, if there even is an all, that the legal transfer of Saddam to the brand, spanking new Iraqi government makes me extremely apprehensive. I mean the Iraqi government had only been a 'newly sovereign' (as stated by one news source) country for a couple of days. And today with Iraqi guards escorting him into court? Can they be trusted? Is there some inside information on his where-a-bouts that extremist and loyalist could possibly hijack him?  Now, don't go accusing me of being pessimistic or unpatriotic. That couldn't be further from the truth. But, those questions, those quandries, and those concerns undoubtibly have not only entered my mind.  Personally, and please don't tell me how inhumane I am, I think they should have killed the S.O.B when they had the chance. Why? To insure HE would not be a problem. He is a sneaking man and as dumb as a fox. That is the truth. Did he give all those he ordered to be tortured a chance? No. Did he give the thousands of men, women, and children that he gassed to death a chance? No. Does he care about the human condition? O
