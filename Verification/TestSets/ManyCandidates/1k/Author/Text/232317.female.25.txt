That's enough for today, I have to get used to this before I can actually post anything else.
(Building resumes) I have looked for Gough Whitlam all day here in the computer space. The pictures are much greater than the text.
educated
or hypereducated,as it is will lack those,qualities of
humanity
Well, it's the silence of this whole thing that is unnerving. Biting. But! That's just the way it goes.
This is it then. This is where I find myself.
A Poem about Vincent:
You dreamed I was an architect
student.
I couldn't stay with you because
I was going to be late for class.
But you wanted me to stay.
We had walked much of the
previous day.
And it wasn't cold because
we held hands.
We became buildings of our own.

Just showed my mum how blogs work. She couldn't read the log properly (going blind) and didn't really think it was too amazing ("It's amazing what you can do these day" and walked out of the room) Hmmm, maybe I'll keep sending her reminders to visit my page! Anyways, keep going girl!
It's so hard to think exactly what I want to write. I try to be very clean and precise with my typing, grammar etc, and I dread pressing the 'publish' key. It's too exact. I have to try to remind myself to use this more often. I love diaries, what the hell is wrong with the computer one? It is the 'real' publish-ness that I am feeling, I think. I'll be more carefree later, I'm sure. These initial stages just feel a little strange.
WELL, then! see you later!
I have a slight sickness (only nasal) and am of course in the country. The only time I ever have to blogg stuff is here, because it's sooooo boring. I am hoping that I won't get bored after a few months, the job is still fun city and totally interesting. Unfortunately Debbie goes on long service leave soon, and then I'll be left to fend for myself, however fortunately, GEORGIA becomes my morning presenter, and therefore we are a team until Deb gets back. I hope so. Because I have a thing for Georgia, but don't tell Vincent. Actually if Georgia is in the job, I shall have to tell Vincent, it's fair. Ohhhh, I have got a big crush on Vincentino! I can't wait to see him tomorrow. Last week, when I saw him at the bar, after not seeing him for a few days I almost had a heart attack he was so spunky!
Back again in the country.
The best news: I have great marks for my hypertext theory and practice subject!
The other best news: Vincent is a sweetie pie.
Working tomorrow at ABC, and then zipping back to Melbourne (practising my voice/speech along the way)!
Maybe I should give this page to my friends in Melbs, so that they can keep up to date. It just seems a little self-centred, don't you think? That I assume my friends will be getting out of touch with what  I   am doing. I don't feel the need, and I'm sure they don't even mind too much. !
It was my first day at ABC Gippsland today. Not a lot happened, but it was a good show, I arranged an interview with this woman that Debbie found. Successfully. I suppose. Anyway, I am here for another two days, with not a lot to do, so I'm trying to fill the time up with all the things that I've been meaning to do for ages. Like empty my mail (e), and update my blogs, and watch a hell of a lot of cable. Yeah. It's all good.
Ohhh, the country. The wide screen of mum and dad's computer. Hmmmm.
Anyways, I'm really not too sure about things down here. Firstly, I am depressed about EVERYthing, but mostly my job. I wish that I was learning more about stuff, than the CSAs and the rundown and blardy blar. It's boring. I wish I were king of the whole sham.
Anyways, I've had an awesome jam packed weekend etc. Because of my birthday, and our house party and every thing. That's another reason why I am so depressed, yeah. whatever. I'm a dickhead!
i am in melbourne yeah yeah
Belle & Sebastian badges are very tempting indeed!
Just updated some of my favourite sites. I love the Jeanette Winterson site, she's very comfortable with using the web, it seems! Cool!
Well, I've been working at the ABC again today down here in Sale. And I'm the most boring-est person on the planet.
I am not enjoying myself, or learning anything, down here. Well, I don't know about it, really. I just keep coming back, and nothing ever changes. I hope that the election will mean more exciting stuff. Like if the candidates down here change, I'll have to get their phone numbers & record them in my contacts book. Yeah.
I'm working at Khok again this weekend, back on track, with no life, no money, no prospects.
Only good smiling friends.
What more does one need?

urlLink Nice Blues Band!
Have seen them twice now, and really gets me excited about blues music (haven't given it much thought before now) Chris Wilson took me to see them at the Old Bar, in Fitzroy, and it was great.
And here's  urlLink something  that was on April's site.
just thought i'd add these links to sites that Alice sent me!
urlLink Find your school friends!

urlLink Alice found a school friend!
Oh, I can't get realplayer to work! Damm
Found a  urlLink great  new page. Good for attaining research!!!!
urlLink  Maybe this will work  , I suppose it doesn't really matter, because it's often too scary and distracting from essays (see below). I have gathered all my results from uni, and am no getting my Honours Year (in Media) application together. It's going to be a killer (I hope!). This is the Uni I'm trying to get into for my honours year  urlLink rmit  and I'm hoping all goes well there. I'm loving my place of employment to bits, but am sick of the country style that accompanies it. Actually it's not so bad! ARGH I'm so confused!
urlLink This can be quite scary  when trying to do y
