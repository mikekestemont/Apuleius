I just have to say...  I love my folks.  they're great.  some people get stuck with really crappy families.  and it's not like you can just pick your folks.  you get stuck with what you get - it's one of those "make the best of it" situations.    not me.    urlLink    I've got the greatest set... ever!  all of the little things they do that annoy me are really just little things.  and if I can get annoyed about little things, it's just a neon sign saying that there aren't big things.  and that's awesome.  that's it.  look at  urlLink pictures  of them.

I have now become the conqueror of all things Tara'sBlog.  grr...  it took me ages to move things to elmadera and get things set up the right way (manual redirects, etc.).  or maybe I'm just lazy and think that technology should obey my every whim and want.  sounds good, doesn't it?  let's see.  in la vida de tara, things are just...  things.  I feel slightly silly about using this blog-thing for a diary.  I already keep a journal (read *not* a diary) - I find that I think much more coherently when I write because it forces my mind to slow down.  while my mouth can *almost* keep up with my mind, my hand certainly cannot.  but I digress.  I think that those of you who actually stumble across this blog should spend some time  urlLink dinking  around  urlLink elmadera.com  and Steve's  urlLink photo gallery .  perhaps instead of boring you with the day-to-day details o' my life that you don't really care about anyway, I'll give you some fun and interesting things to look at.  =)  sounds like a plan, Stan.

so... I've decided that I'd rather do things the way of Steve than do things the way of Tara.  at least for a couple of days.  I'm thinking that using a new toy will give me something exciting to do during my lunch breaks at work while I'm recovering from my sunburn.  see, normally Elayne and I go to the park that's just across the road and sit in the sun.  both of us have been pasty-white for most of our adult lives, and we decided to do something about it.  like go outside.  but...  I just got back from my sister's college graduation (congratulations, Melissa!!).  Here's a pic of us, Melissa on the left, me in the middle and 13-year-old sis Leah on the right.      anyway, I'm playing inside today because I'm recovering from a rather...  peely...  sunburn.  when I stop peeling, I'll once again venture into the world o' sun.  so.  inside... covered that.  ah, yes.  the toy.  it's called wbloggar and can be found online at  urlLink wbloggar.com .  Steven Glenn showed me.  the funnest thing is that now you know what I'm listening to as I post.  go there and look at all the toys.  if you want to know how to use it, you can  urlLink email Steve  and ask him how.  =)   it does two very fun things.  firstly, you can post to just about any blog using something that looks like an im chat window, rather than doing everything on some web-based control site.  simple, powerful, and *fun*.  it works exactly like the blogger.com dashboard stuff, except not in a browser window.  compact, small... woohoo!  secondly, it lets you show folks what you're listening to.  you can know what kind of a mood I was in, or what kinds of things I like - if you care.  if not, it's inconspicuously placed at the bottom, so you don't have to look if you don't care.

here's my how-to-post-a-photo-in-your-blog post. if you're not interested, lo siento.  I have had, however, a total of 1 (one) request for image fun, so here goes.  first thing you need is your photo stored online somewhere. if you haven't staked a claim on a plot of webspace of your own yet, there are several things you can do.  two of such things are:    you can visit some site such as  urlLink freeservers  or  urlLink geocities  and grab some free space in which to "hang" your photos, and then hang your photos.   you can mooch off someone you know, like your sister, and have that person either give you access to their space or hang your images for you.   (btw: it's bad form (or, bad "netiquette") to link to an image on someone else's site.  you should save the image and put it on your own (or your mooch-ee's) webspace so that you're not sucking someone else's users' bandwidth.  plus, that image could evaporate or skip town and then you'd be left only with a red there's-no-image-here "x".)  so.  once you have your picture somewhere out there in personal webspace, all that's left is linking to it in your blog.  here's how you do that:  in your posting window, go ahead and type your post.  decide where you want your image to go, and then, in that spot, type this (subbing in the appropriate information):    &lt;img src=&quot;url_of_image&quot; width=&quot;200&quot;&gt   make sure you specify at least width *or* height - you don't want some humongo image taking over your entire blog, and this way you can say how big it appears to everyone.  now, one last thing... if you are comfortable with html and css, there are more fun and flexible things you can do. for those of you who aren't quite that advanced, I'll show you one here and let you explore the rest.  say you want to have your text wrap around the image...  here's the code, which you should put *above* the paragraph you want to wrap around your image (if you want the image on the left, just sub that into the code below):    &lt;div style=&quot;float:right; padding-left:15px;&quot;&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;img src=&quot;url_of_image&quot; width=&quot;200&quot;&gt &lt;/div&gt;   so, good luck.  have fun.   urlLink let me know  if I can help o
