Hey all！Hope u all find ur way here successfully^^  I know we've got Olly's nice job done on project website. However, I still think it's a good idea to keep a weblog for our project (as what GRAHAM said!). I planned to post all our meeting minutes here. And u all can give any comment about our project!  As I am still new to the Blogger, I'm not sure whether they have column function to classify posts into different columns. Anyway, for now I'm going to use this very ancient way to indicate what the post is roughly about, like [NEWS], [MINUTES], etc.  OK, enjoy our project^^
GNU Zebra Project:    http://www.zebra.org/  RIP Manual:   http://www.zebra.org/zebra/RIP.html#RIP  Also, the link I sent to u before is an old version, the latest version is 0.94:   ftp://ftp.zebra.org/pub/zebra/zebra-0.94.tar.gz  Ignore the other parts, just look at the ripd directory^^
Time & Location: 7pm  Nero Cafe Participants: Kyle, Cecile, Oliver, Sheen   Issues:  1. Threat analysis - olly has done a good job!  2. Alternative of initial policy distribution - hosts send request of initial policy instead of central host distribute it directly; advantages & disadvantages;  3. Interface & module structure done by sheen;  4. Discussion about policy representation: 1) initial policy - vpn establishment information, topology information (graph, neighbours, table); 2) routing policy - security issues, routing information (RIP); 3) all xml format - extensible, ready-to-use parser;   Tasks:  Oliver - Threat analysis, security parts of routing policy; Kyle - Design overview, assistant SSL test; Sheen - Interface, function structure; Cecile - Policy representation.   Next meeting: Tuesday afternoon (22th)

with Steve  1.	Methodology A.	Extreme program is going to be used B.	We can combine a few methodology  2.	Presentation A.	Make it professional  3.	Project A.	Adopt the existing policy contents distribution B.	Information on RFC securing; have a brief look, not too much C.	Virtual Routers D.	RSA E.	One example of threats i.	In somewhere, policy get stopped to be updated ii.	Degree of consistency in network F.	So, we need to think i.	What threats models are used ii.	What requirements are G.	High authentication means high policy H.	Between abstract policy and concrete policy, we need to map those I.	Start with concrete policy  4.	Summary A.	Write a document B.	Prototype about routing and policy representation C.	Use “c”; fast is good, but securing is better D.	Write down the requirements and talk to Manish E.	Prepare the presentation
1.	Policy A.	Contains address, incoming source address, Destination address, QoS B.	Is like a roar set C.	Is like a routing table entry D.	Difference i.	Policy distribution database contains policy entries, interface, destination E.	Difference between VPN and normal i.	VPN; distribution is logical, it has logical meaning and does not concern physical  2.	Issues A.	How to maintain database B.	How to make it secure C.	How to setup and maintain  3.	We can use transport mode because it is dynamic  4.	We need to  A.	find out the operation difference between VPN distribution of policy and normal TCP/UDP routing B.  find out how to setup and maintain C.  find out how to make it secure D.  Need Nortel  5.  Website: www.oliverpriest.com/project      with Steve  1.	Methodology of project A.	Think flexibility; UML etc  2.	About VPN; A.	IIPtran has dynamic routing solution Does it adjust distribution? See cryptograph for key distribution B.	Policy distribution i.	Key_length ii.	Route High level policy; distributed one is human readable Specify GUI etc We concern only secure part We can ignore broader policy  3.	Policy about policy? A.	Who set up the policy B.	Authentication  4.	See “Askenti” www-itg.lbl.gov/Akenti 5.	IPSec A.	In gateway B.	In endpoint(host) C.	But here we have dynamic. Router is in somewhere in network. So? D.	Distribution is about routing information E.	Distribution can be normal routing protocol to get and push  6.	Implementation A.	Test it college LAN B.	So implementation is only for demonstration for one project which means we can do part of it  7.	Idea A.	We want to have dynamic routing protocol that has policy inside saying that how it is routed, pushed, parsed, etc in secure way B.	Solve dynamic routing C.	Policy specification D.	Do it in secure way  8.	Summary A.	Think about “policy of policy” B.	Write down all the problems; don’t expect too much C.	Think as critical D.	Do the project management E.	Look at RFC F.	Read more about Manish’s work G.	About problem, understand what is there, what can be, and what is solved already      with our own group  About project A.  Overview; Olly B.  Objectives; Olly C.  Context of the work; Sheen D.  Project Strategy; Kyle and Sheen E.  Project organization; Kyle F.  Schedule; Kyle G.  Resources; Cecile H.  Evaluation Methods; Cecile I.   Risk management; Cecile and Hyosim J.  Monitoring and controlling; Hyosim
with our own group  1.	Why IPSec Tunnel mode is Nor good for VPN  as Dynamic; A.	Forwarding issues B.	Source address  2.	About the report A.	Router Design and implementation i.	XML; one regarding the policies distribution through an out of band channel ii.	Authentication; one regarding the traffic analysis, inspection and routing B.	Design C.	Implementation i.	Should be in “c” ii.	Libraries; libxml for XML, OpenSSL for securing policy iii.	In each router, policy is stored in file  3.	For whole idea, we need to think about; A.	Why we need B.	What is the whole picture? C.	Every hosts send request to the master and the master controls the request -> Centralized failure D.	So the master’s job with demon needs to be spreaded E.	In nomadic way F.	Key distribution G.	Administrator only needs to set up. In each host, the policy is generated automatically H.	In static, policy management. Policy configuration I.	In dynamic, policy distribution automatically J.	How to find a master? K.	Who asks request to set VPN? L.	Hash chain is used to find a master. So hosts(slaves) know the master, but master doesn’t M.	How to join? i.	Either, VPN is fixed ii.	Tunnel is peer to peer  4.	Conclusion A.	Read the document B.	Learn more about VPN, RFC, Link exchange
with Steve  1.	We need to study the basic understanding background  2.	We need to structure our group 2.1	choose a group coordinator 2.2	identify responsibility  3.	We need to meet everyday  4.	We need to choose the topic in the list of project management  5.	We talked about “policy distribution”, “threats”, “policy language”, and “security aspect”.      with our own group  1.	Clarified responsibilities 1.1	Coding 1.2	Designing 1.3	Leader / Coordinator 1.4	Agenda writing 1.5	Maintaining web site 1.6	Testing  2.
