I'm happy to announce that my dog has arrived and is doing well. She was a bit emaciated, but that didn't affect her energy level. She is especially happy that she has a large yard to run around in, and no longer has to be tied to a chain. We are a bit worried that she can dig her way under the fence, so we haven't left her outside while we aren't at home....Until today.  When I left for work, she was outside and had her food and water handy. She has shelter under the deck, and when it starts to get cold outside, I'll leave the back garage door open for her to come in and warm up. I hope that she is still in the backyard when I get home!  On other notes, my  urlLink cat had kittens Saturday ....It was quite a shock for us, but I can report that mom and babies are doing just great (as long as we keep them away from the dog.) We also took a sight seeing, soul healing trip to  urlLink Rocky Mountain National Park  on Saturday with Bruce, Lisa and Jackie. They were nice enough to rent a mini-van and take us all up.  urlLink It was a great day  and we got to see a lot of what this great state has to offer.  In other, more personal news....I'm still grappling with timelessness. The concept is so difficult to accept, that I may be forced to abandon trying, and start reading a different book :-)  I know now why people take to religion so easily...It gives them a way to explain away the unexplainable, and be more self-actualizing in their actions. It's sad really. I will continue to attempt enlightenment, if there really is such a thing.  Also, I'm still curious why people do stupid things. Most of us have a basic view of what morals and ethics are, and sometimes, someone will just go off the deep end and forget these things. I sure would like to know what mental process makes this happen. It could be emotions. As I have found, emotions are a powerful distracting force, which lead to nothing but trouble. Think about this, if we could control, or even eliminate our emotions, there would be far less crime in the world.  I'm not telling everyone to become Vulcans, but emotions have to be controlled, even quelled, to keep us sane and on level ground. Remember, there is no joy in experience, only in realization.
This morning, after a wait of four months, I'm FINALLY going to get my dog. She has been holed up at my old house in Virginia since I left. I was supposed to get her in early August, but like everything else associated with Virginia...that plan fell through.  A dear friend who lives a bit west of here was in Virginia this week and offered to pick up my dog on the way back. It's nice to know good people!  We are all prepared for her...I bought food, treats, and most importantly, dog shampoo. My friend called me from the road and told me the dog stinks. At least it looks like the she has been getting food these past months, but her disposition is what worries me. She has seen a lot of changes recently...but she will do well here. She has a nice big yard to play in, and we plan on taking her walking/hiking whenever we go.  The dog represents my last "real" emotional link to Virginia...getting her here will bring closure to a lot of things. I'll post pics later!
So...how did your "day of realizing your preconceptions" go?   Unfortunately, I'm not the "trained mind" I want to be yet, so I spent the day being the same Eric I've been for the past few months. I even caught myself actually having emotion this evening for someone who really doesn't deserve it. I was accused of being "soft hearted."  Lemme think about that...yes, so I am soft hearted. Every major emotional event in life seems to stay with me for extended periods. I remember in High School, my girlfriend dumped me, and I failed to grad on time as a result. In the Air Force, my girlfriend dumped me and I spend months in self-imposed solitary in my dorm room. The list goes on and on.  This is one of the reasons I have been studying the concept of "timelessness." This has a lot to do with not pondering the past, because it causes remorse; not focusing on the future, because it leads to ambition and fear; and in the present, the focus is on self and ultimately leads to embarassment. So what am I to do? Apparently, living moment to moment is not the same as living in the present. What?? I still have a lot to learn, and as I do, I'll share it here (oh joy).  The concept of timelessness...hmmmm, I'll post more on this another time. I'm tired and want to go to sleep :-)
An interesting transformation is taking place internally with me. If any of you are familiar with "bracketing," it can be very revealing as to the kind of being you are.  Try this during a normal day. Carry around a small pad or notebook. Everythime you encounter some sort of stumili that brings up a preconceived notion or feeling, write that down and place it in[brackets]. After a full day, look over your pad in the evening before bed...  Now, make a determination to NOT face the next day with any of these preconceptions...no matter how trivial!  Trust me...you will begin to look at yourself differently.  More to come on this...
To all my peeps back east in Virginia...stay dry!
Hello again! I decided to delete everything off of my old blog in order to get a fresh start. I'm living in Colorado now with my two boys (see links above for pics). I'll send more along when I'm done with the changes to the main site.  It's good to be back!
