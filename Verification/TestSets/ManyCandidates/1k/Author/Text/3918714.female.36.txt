Yep, Sunday was a sad day in our house. I hubby decided to get rid of his 1971 Camaro.&nbsp; He had it for 13 years.&nbsp; I was heart broken and mad because he traded for an 1986 Porsche 944 Turbo - 5 on the floor - with boarded out motor to a 951 that does less than 11's in the quarter mile.&nbsp; The car is candy apple red with black bra and trim work.&nbsp; Nice car but I want the Camaro back.&nbsp; I miss it.&nbsp; The Camaro is the car my then soon to be boyfriend - drove up in the first time I ever saw him.&nbsp; It was white with the most awesome flames on it.&nbsp; He won car shows with that car. But still, it's gone now. So, I will continue to mourn for a while even thought it is just a car.
I've noticed that most recently I have had a change in passions. I used to be all about books but since getting into cross-stitching -- the passion has faded slightly.&nbsp; Most natural, I believe.&nbsp; Soon I will tire of the stitching again and crave the books.&nbsp; Just need a bit of change in my life.&nbsp;
I'm tired but it's been a few days since I last blogged (oh that sounds naughty).&nbsp; LOL I realized today I have too much happening in my life.      Husband    Daughter    Dog    Cross-Stitching    Reading    Preparing for book discussions    preparing for quizzes    Chat groups - cat mysteries, cross-stitching, aussie dogs, 2 historical romance,&nbsp; and left behind    shopping    house cleaning    down time for me    Me - showers, sleeping, etc.    personal relationship with God     It's just way too much - time management is not my thing. (oh, forgot blogging on the list).&nbsp; LOL    How do I do it all - by letting some things suffer...by being selfish.&nbsp; The internet for me is very important - it's a drug...I feel that I must stay on top of stuff or I will lose out.&nbsp; Gosh, I wonder if I can turn off this thing. most likely not.&nbsp; It's my drug of choice.&nbsp; I wonder why I try to fit so much in a small day....longing for the simple life - before hubby and child.&nbsp; But it is the life I dealt for myself and I must live it.&nbsp; There are not enough hours in the day to do all that&nbsp; I want to do.&nbsp; Silly me requires sleep.&nbsp;     There is so much more I want to do....work a job, go back to college, write novels ( that will be tricky since I have no skills), do book reviews, and so forth!    What makes it harder is being with a man that doesn't help -- thinks that just because he works during the day out side of the home -- there is nothing for him to do here at the house.&nbsp; My hubby greets the dog better than our daughter - and I get nothing.&nbsp; No hug, No kiss, no hello - just grunts, complaints and where's my dinner.&nbsp; Ahhhh, the sounds of Ward Cleaver returning home.&nbsp; Yeah right - in my dreams.&nbsp; As the line goes in a movie (coyote ugly) "....he is good for a first husband..." or something to the effect.&nbsp; LOL I'm bad.&nbsp;     I'm tired.&nbsp; I want to be alone just for a little while to remember the good things about the stuff that is driving me bathe!&nbsp; Where's my pillow?&nbsp; It calls to me - begging for attention.&nbsp; And I will be its servant!&nbsp;     Later Gator
The back cover blurp caught my attention. ".....HELP! I'm stuck in Egypt with a pushy girl named Chloe, a cursed bracelet, and a hottie who makes my toes curl...." This seems like a silly type of book but I think I will enjoy it. It will be my next book to read and review.   I started reading this book and yes, it's silly.&nbsp; It is actually a Teen Romance genre.&nbsp; The language is annoying at times ... and I have to relax because this book is written from the point of view of a 16 yr old girl - who is feeling unworthy and unwanted by her family.&nbsp;   She has no self worth at times and it's make me want to slap her.&nbsp; Our Heroine (name escapes me at the moment) finds herself in Egypt on a dig.&nbsp; She meets a hunk of a guy that has a twin.&nbsp; Double the yummies.&nbsp;   The hitch is at first there is a comedy of errors because she is unaware of the twin thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first mystery is set when Jan (that's her name - January) is lost in a village outside of the Cairo.&nbsp; And 2 men attack her because of a "Handmaiden" -- Jan had no clue who or what that is.&nbsp; Mr. Hottie (aka Seth) rescues her.&nbsp;   Second mystery, why everyone thinks Seth is the evil twin (he and his brother are named after ancient twin gods) -- while I think it's the other twin.&nbsp; Seth is being cheated by his parents -- not being given the same chance to be educated in the States, etc.&nbsp; So Jan has been warned that being with Seth can lead to her getting hurt -- but she doesn't care -- she'll risk it.&nbsp;   What will the rest of the book reveal? We'll see!    I FINISHED THE BOOK......  Mysteries solved, Mr. Hottie finds redemtion with his parents and the girl gets the guy.&nbsp; It's a cute story and I'm not interested in the 2nd book.&nbsp; This book is going into the Wild most likely.
I just finished Canapes for the Kitties by Marian Babson.&nbsp; This is a good book. I&nbsp; love the cats: Had-I, But-Known and Roscoe.&nbsp; The first thing that bothered by about this book is the fact that it switched from Lorinda Lucas' novel back to the story at hand about Lorinda and her friends.The book of over 250 pages keep me guessing as to who the killer was - which I guessed by page 200 and confirmed later. Some of the characters were annoying - theAmerican Couple -- especially. I like t
