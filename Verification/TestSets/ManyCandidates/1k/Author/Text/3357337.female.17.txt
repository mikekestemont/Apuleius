as of this writing i have exactly 11 days before another school year officially kicks off. and that schoolyear my friends isnt just something.  coz in about eleven days, i am a college student. a freshman in a university.  i came from a catholic all-girls school and thats where all this drama is coming from.  the university is conveniently(im being sarcastic here) 2 hours away from where i live.  and im going to commute after my first week.  maybe this is just jitters..or im just freaking out. ..  but i guess its not all baaadd. i got in the course i want. i'll be majoring in communication arts. ill be studying the subjects of my dreams. so i guess ill be fine. yeah, ill be fine.
Survivor isnt reality tv.  Spongebob is.  Spongebob works in a diner and has a selfish,self-centered crab for a boss. He works there despite the fact that he knows that most of the time his boss isnt up for any good. All these, well..because he has no choice and he enjoys cooking those crabby patties.   Spongebob has an egoistic colleague who acts as if he owns the place. Although Spongebob is the one who cooks the food that makes the diner successful, he treats Spongebob like shit. Talk about being insecure.  Spongebob has a stupid friend starfish who he has to deal with every single day. Spongebob has to endure idiocy at its best and still keep his sanity.   These are the things that every person, at any point in their screwed up lives, experience. This is reality personified in a cartoon.   And yeah, when u get stranded in an island, u dont get followed by a camera and u try to help the other people who are stranded too to survive. Because ur human, and that is just how it goes...how real life goes.
i finally have my own blog! hehe. i think this is cool, sharing my thoughts-my random thoughts-with the world..at least as far as the world wide web is concerned. :)  just recently, i read the book entitled "i kissed dating goodbye" by joshua harris. its a great book and it opened my eyes about relationships. there were some parts that i could not relate to though coz its about marriage and stuff like that. im just turning 17! but i have to say that i indeed kissed dating goodbye..at least for now.
answer: by backstabbing.  i hope some will be informed that the world isnt round for nothing. u can't do anything that isnt goin to come back to you and get u at ur rear.   there are a lot of things goin on in our world- children starving, women are being abused, HIV is fast spreading, our economy on the ground, terrorism, obesity..and the list goes on and on... and what do some people care about? bring others down and talk nasty things behind their backs.  i hope and pray karmic forces will go gentle on you, and i hope and pray i can forgive you too. and while im at it..here is what you are supposed to do:  get a life.
so far, so good.   what u just read aptly describes my first month as a college freshman. and so far, i have not failed a single quiz and they are coming my way faster that u can say stop. i go home everyday unscathed, and i am eternally grateful.  i have filed for diff orgs like its the end of the world tomorrow. as of now, ihave filed for 4 orgs. i cancelled wat cud have been my first brush with theater because i nid to study math and the constitution...no regrets.. i passed the test. im about to cancel one more, i got accepted in another, and the last one is still pending. if ur thinking that this will be the last of my applications, well..think again..coz i am goin to apply in another one related to advertising.    now this is my version of suicide..minus death.
i was at the mall a while ago, and then after an hour of mind shattering, ground-breaking um..aimless wandering aka window shoping..i felt the urge to go to wendy's and eat a hamburger.  so there i went, ordered my burger and sat in one of their chairs... alone.  now what is it about people eating alone in a fastfood restaurant that compels some people to wonder (out loud and otherwise)and fuss and get fidgety in their own seats? a lady came up to me and asked me if i was ok. "i was, until u came up to me and asked me that stupid question", i said to myself. that and the stares i got from the other diners.  call me paranoid, or something else..but i think people nowadays are geting more and more clique-y and dependent. i think its about time people try to enjoy the company of their own selves..its not being a loner and detaching yourself from others.. but, i think, people will come up with better things to say, suggest more happening hang outs,or better yet be more effective people who lead fun lives if they can be able to be with themselves even for just an afternoon.  its like loving. u cant really give something u dont have or did not really get to enjoy.   the bottomline is..its ok eat alone. its ok to be with nobody.... sometimes.   i know.  i have to let it go and loosen up.
I want to feel butterflies in my stomach.   I am sitting here in front of my computer with petroleum jelly all over my lips (its chapping like hell)on a fine friday night. i cannot sleep and its killing me.. and.. I have no one to talk to.  Now I realize that I am really alone. That there is a part of me thats envious of other people for having someone in their arms. I guess, no matter how cynical this world may be, the people living in it are still hopeless romantics.   At the end of the day, what everybody wants is s
