urlLink    To Dani from Crystal: I didnt really no Dani for a very long time, I met her in a chat room on my birthday. She actually offered me a car for a present. A car, for me, a 15-year-old stranger. She was really nice to me. I didn't exactly know why, but we became fairly close. As close as one could get for knowing a person for such a short time. We were so alike, even though we didn't really know each other. We liked the same things, same cars, we had oekaki in common, and the funniest part was that we had the same bra size. When I think of that it makes me happy that I at least got to know one person on the Earth, who was kind, sweet, and an all around good person before I didn't have the chance to meet anyone like that. I don't think anyone will ever be as nice as she was.  ~A memorial to Danielle~

urlLink    To Dani, from Hannah: Thinkin' of you everyday Feeling in every way Walking in the cold fall wind Come to me, so suddenly  I told with you everything Under the evergreen When the sun was going down Even when you felt cold  I could see the truth right in your eyes What you said never had any lies Every time when I was feeling blue You stood by me  When I used be a child Believed in wonderland I've forgotten for long time Now I see it's in your eyes  What you always said to me Now I can realize It's not easy to take it You said KEEP ON DREAMING  All the troubles we would have gone through Someday we will make our dreams come true Now I know you'd make a brand-new start Please don't look back  I could see the truth right in your eyes What you said never had any lies Every time when I was feeling blue You stood by me  No word to say, no reason why I believe in that you're my best friend Don't have to cry, Don't say goodbye 'Cause I know that you are my best friend  No word to say, no reason why I believe in that you're my best friend Don't have to cry, Don't say goodbye You're the one and only my best friend =Dani with her friend Hannah=  ~A memorial to Danielle~
urlLink    To Dani from Lisa :  I wonder how it's been with you? In the cold wind, I pondered a little bit. We leaned against a branch and talked, didn't we? My body started to chill, and as the sun was setting, I ended up crying. And as if to protect me, you came and stood silently by my side, didn't you? I felt like your eyes reflect a wondrous world You taught me how to dream and long and such. I told you only a little while ago, even if we get torn apart, I won't forget our dreams, so... ...even though I'm far away from you, I don't want to give up. Even though we've always been rivals. I don't need to hear any news, beloved friend I don't tell anyone else my foremost thoughts We'll meet once more, right, beloved friend I won't forget you, beloved friend =This is Dani with her friend Lisa=  ~A memorial to Danielle~
urlLink    Silent afternoon Curtains swept up by a gentle breeze Floating memories In hours like these of the days that we share Like an ending summer eclipse Sweet sun pours in from the window And this shadowed room turns into gold Outshinning sorrow In this peace of mind, no apprehensions I've found my own - a bright reflection Something calm and strong, I can't explain it and it's embracing me I'll wake up to the morning sun here comes another day and somehow know everything will be OK. Wind chime, lullabies Calling me into my garden Where we kissed the seeds to grow and to bloom tenderly in the spring Daydreams arise in s
