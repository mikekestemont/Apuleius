I'm pretty pissed about two things now, so let me start. first. this is addressed to  all ssc graduates. MAMANSIN NAMAN KAYO!!! KALA NYO KUNG SINO KAYO!!!! ANAK**&$!!!!! tayo na nga lang magkakasama sa walang kwentang skul na to kala nyo kung sino kayo. yung mga iba naman namamansin sila at nakikipagkuwentuhan pero yung iba nakakaloko na. parang gusto ko silang hagisan ng mga silya. E=mc2.      Second. "...: gaya gaya naman talaga itong tag board na ito eh.. ive seen this site before... wala naman.. mr pocholo henson.. ive seen your site.. and it looks exactly like this... yeah.. only blue.. yeah" "plaigarism? holy crap... your blog looks like mine! only, it's blue!...that says a lot about you..."  GAGO. ooohhh.... my site has a tagboard... cool... has a graphic of the week too... awesome dude... give me a freaking break. what's next, "cadaver of the week?" DumbASS.
Just finished watching "Big Fish", a film by Tim Burton... very good, highly  recommended... also saw jackass the movie... no comment. Can't believe this.... i'm actually spending all my prepaid internet time on this blog... Question... required ba sa mga IT at MassComm students sa AUF na magsuot ng make-up na parang si minney mouse at ng mga skirt na kakasya lang sa isang 9-month old na baby? Halos nanlalaki ang mga mata ng mga male species kapag uupo ang mga babae sa mga bench sa quad a... o quad b? di ko alam... o kaya sa pag-akyat nila sa mataas na mga hagdan sa library? o pag nag-tricycle sila papunta sa au? how do i know all these things? courtesy of a classmate na nag-enroll sa auf para lang makaboso. (name ommitted for protection) hahaha.... not really true. sheeeeiit.
Forget the thing about the damn revamp. sheeit. napakawalang kwenta ng auf. ung section  namin walang unity, maraming sipsip, backstabbers, plastik(pareho lang ba yun?) at napaka INGAY. dammit. parang isang litrong kape ang iniinom nila araw-araw. may teacher na eh sige pa pagbubuladas ng walang kakwenta-kwentang bagay. isa pa- may mga makakapal ang mukha na nag-aastang lider. mga sasa kayong lahat. tangna, kaya nga walang unity eh! pangalawa! napakaliit na bagay, pinapalaki!! ano ba yan? mukhang mga retard sila na kailangan pang palakihin ang usapan para maintindihan ng mga kukote nila. I can almost imagine myself sa ust, taking up journalism, major in social climbing. o kaya naman sa up, taking up psycho... buti pa dun, sa tingin ko, dun ako babagay. IM A PSYCHO STUDENT!!! hahaha.... seriously, i admire psych students, mga iskolar ng bayan, for that matter. i can almost imagine myself sitting beside t.. that didn't come out right.... chatting w/ people who share my interests- books, politics, people who have understandable opinion. di tulad sa puro video games at porn cd's ang pinag-uusapan. for your hate mail, send all death threats to choii214@yahoo.com. add nyo rin ako sa friendster kung gusto nyo... :-)
For the gifted few of you members of the human race, who care about american imperialism, i recommend you watch fahrenheit 9/11 by michael moore. Good film.. Currently showing at all pirated CD stalls in Angeles. Near Jollibee, to be specific. While youre at it, send me a porn CD. Be discreet. :-)   Oh yeah, fuck you Ely Buendia for leaving Eraserheads the greatest band ever formed. goddamn you to hell. Hmmm.... Itsumo = STUPID. Nakaboso na naman ako kanina. Yey....
bakit ang daming magagandang babae sa u.p.? sa au maganda nga, puro panlalalake at make-up naman pinag-uusapan. paksyet.
will revamp blog soon, too lazy.................. daming units ng mga bsn students... do they want us to die before we earn thousands of dollllllllllaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrssssssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!
there's so much hype over that person. even his kids now have educational plans. para pa nga balatuan nya yung mga nang-hostage  sa kanya. dammit.
who will win? hope kerry does, bush is an asshole.
paksyet. nakakapagod..........
Sa wakas. may blog na. tenkyu karl sampang
You Won't Like Me When I'm Angry.
Go Team Philippines! (flashes sarcastic smile.)
At the end of the first part, the tribe of dipshits residing in room 315 died, were killed by the infamous Mr. Pocholo Henson. Unfortunately, their cadavers absorbed liquid nitrogen reacting with plutonium. So they roamed the fucking room.              Part 2.  Anthropology. So there was this project. It was like a magazine. Logically, every magazine has its editor. I being the genius that I am, was appointed one of the five editors.        The class was divided into five, for the five magazines.         For the meantime, there was peace and harmony.  Then, some DIPSHITS changed the freaking groupings. the deal was, rearrangements were approved, provided that the editor approved..         Since I had no fucking idea what the hell was happening, it means that I did not approve.  I complained, got angry, cursed, destroyed a chair, (the usual ranting) tapos, ako pa ngayon ang masama. Eh mga gago pala kayo eh! Kahit na binigay nyo saken mga bobong mga ka-group i don't GIVE A FLYING FUCK! Just ask for my consent Dipshits!! is that too hard to understand!!        Dipshit is the theme for this blog, so leave now if you don't want profanity, because there's more to come.         There's gonna be some serious ass-kicking.         (insert part 3 here)
Ever noticed the camera phone, music phone, n-gage, phone bomb, nuclear phone, etc? What the hell? Nokia and Others are capitalizing on the sheer stupidity of  Filipinos. A cellphone will always be a cellphone. that is, to CALL people. However, because Filipinos are naturally DUMB, (remember the water-powered car by Daniel Dingel which could have ended our dependency on oil but the fucking government lacked the political will?) these gadgets are happily consumed by the populace, mainly the social climbers and techno-geeks. Though i don't see a camera phone as an evil invention, using this phone to capture nude pics of female species isn't very morally gratifying. Just buy a 3310 and a camera!  Much, much cheaper.  75 million Filipinos think that Nokia Phones are cool. (Stole this idea from www.maddox.xmission.com since I am a plagiaristic bastard)
Dipshits. I hate you all. except for some handpicked people, i hate you all. kala nyo k
