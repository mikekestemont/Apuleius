Sorry 'bout the last post, I sent an corrected link out to everyone in my address book... including my blogger e-mail address! I'm still a n00b at bloggin... So forgive me :D  Now I'm going to bed, and that's FINAL! GOODNIGHT!
It's http://www.thepencilcase.blogspot.com - my apologies! LoZ  _______________ Forward Header _______________ Subject:	Mine and Jonny's Blog! Author:	Lawrence Dudley   Date:		13th May 2004 10:58:53 pm  Is.... *drum roll* Published! http://www.thepencilcase.blogger.com Leave me some comments 'bout it on my blog! LoZ :-)
Intro Right... so I guess I have an obligation to tell you who we are, right? (The answer's yes :-p ) Well... Here goes...  LoZ (Me) Age: 14, nearly 15 Sex: As often as possible (sorry, couldn't resist) Male Location: York, small town in north-england What i look like: *insert bloody picture here, i dunno how to yet* *gives up* long black hair, green eyes, whiteish brownish skin, quite tall... i'll chuck a pic on uploadit.org as soon as i can :-)  Jonny (He'll post here soonish, like maybe tomorrow) Age: 14, also nearly 15, but 1 month older than LoZ Sex: Male Location: Same as LoZ What he looks like: Blonde, short hair, blue eyes (i think) bit taller'n LoZ. White skin (get in the sun, you msn addict :-P ) Pic also soon on it's way!  Both: We go to school together and are forced to sit next to each other. Nah not really heh, but when I was first told I was sittin next to him, I was horrified... suicidal even! (just messin, jonny!)  Anyway, we drive our teachers crazy by singing our pencil case, dictionary and maybe rap in class. Or we just talk crap :D Oh, we're in year 9 btw...  If I've left anything out, leave me a comment :-)  Anyway, really gotta go sleep, I've got school tomorrow... again... IT SUCKS! Over 'n' out!
I hope you sleep well. Goodnight.
Welcome! First post... wish us luck :-)
Do you think I should allow her to stay? I mean, she's cute n funny, but will she spout as much rubbish as she did tonight? I'm undecided, as she'll no doubt be rather upset if i remove her... You decide! Comment on the post below, as this one's mail2blog and so doesn't (yet) have a comments button...  Talking about Lou, will you be at the skate park tomorrow? Be cool if you are :)  LoZ
im ot nutz im "special" *coughcough*retarded*coughcough* and strange
Oh! She beat me to it! Oh well... now only Jonny's missing... I'll ring him up and complain about him not gettin his account sorted yet :P I feel sorry for him already!  I'm amazed at how many comments I've had already, considerin this blog's less than 24 hours old... and not to mention e-mails :-) Oh well... makes me feel wanted i guess :D Apologies about Lou, I guess you caught her in one of her "funny" moods ;-) best not say too much stuff along those lines, or she'll come round and beat me up! Nah not really, but she's a touch nuts occasionally... Why have i let her onto my blog? Oh I dunno, thought you could do with a little excitement ;-)  Tell me if she does anything tooo outrageous... please? I've got to be off, mum wants me to look upo some flight times for her... LoZ
Go check my profile. I look better in real-life though - that pic's CRAP cos i'm tired :-( Lou's managed to join (finally) so expect an introduction soon...
hewwo all, Im lou, im kinda crazed and not very good at writing theese thingz, im high on life right now, meaning im extreamly hyper  hehe.... sorryz waaaaaaaaay 2 hyper.... mmm 2 litre bottle of coke..... ok caaalm down louby............. gooooose flaaabber.....     hmmm stuff about me, i have no idea....   ok thatz me hypered out buhbyez x0x0x0x0xLoux0x0x0x0x0x0x
What will i be writing about?  Well... I really do not know, as soon as I have these two people who are having trouble getting accounts online, it should become rather more interesting... I haven't really planned anything for this blog, but the idea is that it will reflect on the lives me and my two fellow students lead :)
For there not being any "comments" buttons on some posts... these have been sent from my phone and, for some reason known only to blogger the comments button on mail2blog is broken... give it a few days and it'll *hopefully* be fixed!
It's Lou, who will be posting her random lil comments on life in here. And no, Jonny, we're NOT going out, just good friends :-)
He gave permission to be tied up :-P Our class-room's worse than Guantanamo Bay sometimes!
K, i had a comment asking me how on earth the teacher didn't notice... well here's a pic:   He's not the brightest of ppl (the teacher) and doesnt notice those sorts of things!
Some comments i got: "You are just startin bloggin: are you goin to hav somethin to blog about? I'm at school too an it's not that bloggin interestin."  Yeah... well I thought that startin a blog and postin to it would be fun... and it is! If you don't like it you can leave, beleive it or not, and besides, I can't please everyone!!  "what's a nOob?" A n00b, as in newbie... search google and you'll find it used mainly in internet forums :-)   LoZ
Gawd! I'm well tired! Oh well, it's the weekend now, so I can sleeeeep for a while :) Will try and drag myself outa bed tomorrow n go skatin... Cherry'll kill me if I don't lol  Today school was ok, but not great. As in could have been better. We had singing at school and we tied someone to a chair :D Don't worry, the teacher didn't notice :P (Actually my teacher *could* be reading this, so hush!) Just about to have my dinner... Laters!!!!!
At last! Just listenin to Avril Lavigne: Anything But Ordinary... Gawd I love that song! Mmmh, I've got pomegranate to eat... Yum!  Do I sound like I have too much free time?  LoZ
Mum lost her keys this morning, I l
