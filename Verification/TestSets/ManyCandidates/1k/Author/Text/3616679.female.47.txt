At this time in my life, I desperately need words to live by.  A few years ago, I collected, authored, and wrote a small journal for each of my young sons to be given to them on the day they leave the nest. Remembering this, I took one out and read what I had wrote to them and realized that some of the wisdom I wrote on those pages was abundantly appropriate for me to take to heart one more time. Now to practice what I preach:    Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take... but by the moments that take our breath away.     If you see an opportunity, and you don't know what to do... ask yourself:  "Will it make me a better person, a better Child of God?" If the answer is a definite "YES!"  - then GO FOR IT!!    It takes a strong man to say "I'm sorry", and it's easier than digging out of the hole denial creates  somewhere down the road.    I asked the Lord how much He loved me. He answered, "This much." And then he stretched out His arms and died for me.    What is Love?  by young children: It's what makes you smile when you're tired. It's what's in the room with you at Christmas if you stop opening presents and listen. It's like when grandma got arthritis and couldln't bend over and paint her toenails anymore - and my grandpa did it for her all the time even when his hands got arthritis too...that's love.    A strong man never stands alone....visible or invisible, there are others holding him up and out towards the world.    The most destructive force in the world?    Gossip.    Never be afraid to try something new...remember: a lone amateur built the Ark, a large group of professionals built the Titanic.    Always leave loved ones with loving words... it may the last time you see them.    Learn that no matter what happens, or how bad it seems today, life does go on, and it will be better tomorrow.  There are more for another time.  Everyone has a favourite group of words stored in the subconscious for times of darkness and despair...don't they? Whether from the Bible, the Torah, the Koran, from their mother, or best friend.  Words that strike a choral note in the heart, sear meaning in the mind, and are tucked away for the rainy days of life.
I would never have guessed that 2004 would be a life-transitional time. After living for nearly half of a century, I feel as though I have been shoved back into a cocoon. I must stay hidden, quiet, and dormant for a period of time. Faith in the essence of just being alive fortifies my consciousness to be certain that I will emerge with a new life, a fresh perspective, and the chance to dream again.   I have great hope for the future...I must, or I will not survive the "re-birth". For this, I lean on my faith in God. And then will come the business of my God guiding me in "getting started" in a new phase of my life...learning to spread my wings and exploring my new world.  But for now, I am curled in my home awaiting my time. Scared, lonely, persecuted, angry...but thanking God for the few good friends who are with me. Patiently I wait for the getting-started-gun to go off to break the chains that bind me.
Some days I feel as though if I have to continue to be STRONG  for just one more minute....I will SCREAM!!!  I'm sick of being the strong one. I'm sick of being the one with all the answers. I'm sick of standing up straight with a stiff upper lip. When do I get to lean? When do I get to let another take charge of life, even if just for a little while? When can I lighten up?  My parents leaned on me, my friends lean on me, my spouse leaned on me, my kids lean on me, my co-workers lean on me, my bosses lean on me. Is it just my sympathetic character, or am I inadvertently doing something to attract this attention? I can't lighten up...even while I strive to help others to do so.  Yet, I love helping people.  They are unburdened, and I receive great satisfaction in giving aid. Is it selfish to find satisfaction in that? It would be wrong if I felt relief that they move on and away from me, but what I feel is a great personal sigh of satisfaction: because deep down inside I know that this is what "life is all about".  But I can't lighten up. I worry about others, I think about others, I work for others, I care for others, I love others. In taking on their burdens, I add to my own. Yet I do it time and time again knowingly.  And I have so many of my own burdens/problems/crises to deal with right now... I have learned lately who my real friends are. I have watched them step up to the plate as I have weakened. I have felt their hands holding me up. I have listened to their yearnings for my future happiness.  ...and they are not the ones whom I have helped, these special angels are different ones. Appearing out of nowhere,  some of whom I never knew even noticed me before.  Why don't the ones whom I have helped help me now? I sympathize with them again... it must be hard to watch the one who was once your saviour, guardian, protector...fall to pieces before your very eyes. What do they say to me?  What can they do for me?  What is most imporant is that I practice what I preach. That I do in front of these ones that which I urged them to do. And most importantly, that I show them that it works time and time again...because they are watching me.
