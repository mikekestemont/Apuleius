urlLink    I figured I would post the pictures seeing as I just found them in my e-mail!!&nbsp; urlLink
Wassup,   Since my ass is so bored I figured I might as well chip in on this idea created by the all mighty and short Leah.  Not bad though, not bad at all.  gotta give it to ya.  I hope everyone is having a great time.  I believe by now, hopefully, Pepe should have posted the pictures from the camino onto ofoto, so if yall want to check it out, feel free (if not, my bad, call Pepe and complain, not me!lol.they got all the pics)Yall know me, I have been up to the same old mischief:getting piss ass drunk, streaking, throwing up, lo normal(a.k.a. sitting on my ass studying and being an angel/mama's boy.)        Before I knock out, I'll give yall a quick brief summary of what we did since we said our goodbyes in Madrid.   During the camino, it was hot as mofo'in hell but we all made it through, Mark, Pepe, and I.  Pepe and I for a while really had some pretty cool farmer tans. We met a lot a dope people, and we met others....not so dope. I remember one day when it was blazin outside and we all decided to jump in a river.  It was all good till the current swept away my flip flop and I busted my ass trying to chase that bitch down.  Pepe and I took some....interesting fotos in the water.  Then we all ran out once Mark screamed, "LEACHES!"lolol When we finally reached Santiago, we realized that our saying during school was a load of crap, "Don't worry! You'll lose it on the camino!"  There were days when I found myself eating five sandwhiches with ham, cheese, and mashed chips;a liter and a half of water;a pack of cookies; and two bananas and an orange.  Ladies and gentleman, that was only for lunch! Anyway, after the camino we traveled home and had a going away lunch with the teachers one last time at Pasta Nostra(bangin ass brownie!)The one thing I remember is when Mark, Pepe, and I were in the computer room and then Todd walked in and said,"...You guys stink!"lol.  But I have to admit, that shit was kickin, almost as bad as leah's feet.lol.  Finally we departed and went our separate ways.  On the fifteenth I received a warm welcoming to the states with a bomb threat at JFK(my mother went up the wall, literally!)Since then, I've been hangin out, maxin and relaxin.   Well, it's late, I'm chillin, and it's quiet.  Before I hit the sack I just wanna give a shout out to everyone.  WASSUP YALL! I hope yall are safe and takin it easy. Give a special shout out to Mark who's probably shootin shit up trying to make up for the year in spain, Pepe who's probably slicing some cat up with his fencing shit, Will who I hope is safe and chillin in Spain with some hot as chick, he deserves it, and finally Leah who's chillin in wack ass Rhode Island and sleepin right now because she gotta go to school, have fun, miss ya!lololol Aight dogs, I'm out. THis shit wasn't as short as I thought it would be.  Well, anyway, write back, don't be strangers and if yall want to visit, feel free, the bathtub is always empty!Peace Z...z....Z....z...Z...z

Hey So seeing as we seem to suck at group e-mails because I haven't seen any of them come my way....which I assume means we haven't been sending them I figured I would create a blog because this way we can share pictures and just all keep in touch.  Tell everyone from SYA you want about it.  I thought it would be a good way for us to all keep in touch.  To send pictures you have to download Hello.  It is really easy to use.  Well hope to hear from y'all soon.  Un beso Leah
Umm okay, random moment… So I got an e-mail and a pic from the girl who’s going to be my future roommate. She seems nice and very smart (she knows 6 languages or something). I think we’re going to get along quite well except she said she likes to watch a lot of TV…that might be a problem. Can YOU draw a frog? I got a cute little pig cup that I think I’m going to use to put all my coins. Todas esas monedas que no cambian en los bancos y ¿saben porque? ¡Porque no tienen uso, son innecesarios! Mental spasm! Mental Spasm! Necesito comer fruta. So I hit my chin (sometime between when I woke up and now) and it looks like a dark purple marker splotch. I have been infected with chin-arker disease. The saddest thing is I don’t know con que me pegue. LOSSING THE LITTLE SANITY I HAD TO BEGIN WITH. He he he he he the phone is ringing. Yesterday I watched four hours straight of TV, that’s how bored I was! And guess what I was wondering about while I was watching those shows; I was wondering si ¿han probado las alcachofas con queso? Son muy ricas. Did you notice how I’m no longer using vosotros? There’s no need. I’m also relearning to treat elders by usted instead of tu. Hablando de elders, mañana me voy a la playa con mis abuelitos, mis tíos, mi primo y mi hermano. Espero que sea divertido. Me tengo que ir a hacer mi cama…there’s too much pink on this computer and way  too many 15 year olds around.  ¡Espero que estén bien!
