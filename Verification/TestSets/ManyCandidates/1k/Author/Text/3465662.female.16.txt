urlLink    Double Printing. These are obviously 2 different negatives. I took the picture of the tree by the other one (by the gas station), and the water rings by the grocery store. I was the first of all the classes to attempt this project, and it worked on my first try.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Palm tree at sunset in Rosarito. It looks like a postcard image.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Surf at sunset.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    This was taken on the beach at sunset by the broken pier in Rosarito. &nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    I like this shot a lot. I like how the water looks very blue and the sky has the orange and yellow. &nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    This is the bench my grandma like to sit and read at when she's down at her house in Rosarito. &nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    This one reminds me of the Pirates of the Caribbeann. It's a pic of Britt with her hand on her rifle when we were in Mexico. &nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Telephone wire crossing outside my door&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Trees by my house at sunset. So pretty.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Clouds and tree in Colorado&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Santa Sophia church at sunset.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    This is one of the first projects I got in my photo class. It was really easy; just bring in some things, put them on the photo paper and turn on the enlarger. &nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Kid on Merry-Go-Round. I was in Balboa Park when I came to the carousel. I was going to take a picture of just the horse, but then the kid got on...so I took the picture of him too. I got this into 2 art shows; one at my school and one at the mall...It didn't win anything, but it was there. I thought that was pretty cool.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    I took this picture last year when my friend, Suzy, and I were walking around school taking dumb pictures. It was a bad picture of a duddy flower, but it looks cool solarized. &nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    No, this is NOT an evil moose-man. This is a picture of my cat, Pooch cleaning himself. Can you see it? &nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    This picture doesn't look quite right to me, something about the way the light was shining on the lilly pads, or the focusing. I like it that way though... I'm not sure why. This was taken by the botanical gardens in Balboa Park. &nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    I took this for a project in my photo class. 2 old men feeding pidgeons in Balboa Park.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    I took this on my walk home by a gas station. &nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    This picture was also taken in Seaport Village. &nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    This picture was taken in Seaport Village. They're just some ducks takin' a bath.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    And one more of those&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    And another.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Here's another one of those cloud shots I took in Mexico that I never posted. It was very difficult choosing a picture to put up for this challenge because I do like taking pictures of clouds so I have quite a few. I'm not sure if this is my favorite, but it shows the clouds and the sunbeams and the focus is on the water so...I dunno, I just like it. &nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    A picture of the clouds I took out of the window without looking when we were on the freeway.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    And another out of the car window, not on the freeway this time though.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    And another of that&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    My friend, Brittany, and her reflection. &nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Leaves. Kinda looks like some grapes to me. &nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    The plants at the top of that fence&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    And another&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    This is a view of some leaves through the fence at my friend's house. &nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Here's one of just the petal I took a bit ago. It was the only thing I could think up for this week's challenge. I know a lot of people were doing flowers and whatnot, but.....too bad, this is my picture and I like it. So...yeah. The petal does look quite perfect to me.  urlLink
urlLink    Another...&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    The stupid camera kept focusing on the wood behind the flower...I couldn't get it to stop&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Another diving shot. Tanya this time. &nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    View of the trees by the pool &nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    The water at the pool I was swimming @ yesterday. &nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Here's the same one of Pooch in the mirror,just more pretty. : )&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    The sun and clouds above the pool&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink     I think this picture diplays fashion because they are my new sunglasses I got at Pacific Eyes and T's and one place fashion still counts is at the pool. &nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Another short through my sunglasses, but at the pool this time&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    My friend, Brittany going under&nbsp; urlLink

urlLink    I got 2 this time!!&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    And another...attempting to get some suga'!&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Yet another of the bird&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Here's another one with the backyard view through my sunglasses. It wasn't originally black and white, but it looks better that way.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    I've been a little obsessed with getting a good shot of the hummingbird. Clearly this isn't it, but it's hard!&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    This is a picture of the hummingbird I got right as he was flying away. This shot looks like a journey for me because the bird is so little and the sky around him seems limitless.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Here's another picture of him. It's kinda grainy because I was using the optical and digital zoom on my camera.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    The hummingbird that lives in my backyard. It was hard to get him to stay there becuase he kept flying away when I came near him...or when he chased away another hummingbird trying to get some food.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    This is the view of the fence in my backyard through my sunglasses on the table.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    These a
