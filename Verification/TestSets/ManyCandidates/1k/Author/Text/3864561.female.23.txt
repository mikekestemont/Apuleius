Which one is the genuine advice page and which is a shameless parody? According to the government, many people can't tell. See if you're smarter than the average voter:   Preparing for Emergencies   Preparing for Emergencies   Clue: there is no such government office as HM Department of Vague Paranoia.
I've been lucky enough to procure a site meter that not only tells me how many people have visited my blog but also where they came from and, if they used a search engine, what they entered to get them here. So far I've had 4 visitors via Yahoo, who must have been sorely disappointed to end up here with the following search terms:  * Timothy Omundson * John Stalker adverts * birthday kiss * "Kevin Rahm" pictures  I must admit I am quite sad that there is so little stuff about Tim Omundson on the Internet that someone doing a web search for his name would end up here with my one crappy little photo of him (which was stolen from someone else's website anyway); he has recently joined the likes of  Robert Duncan McNeill  and  Colin Firth  as Men I Would Like To See More Of (on whatever level you want to interpret that) and I'm frankly amazed more people don't seem to think the same. Anyway, for the benefit of anyone else who strays here looking for him, there is a pretty good website about him (which doesn't always show up on search engines for some reason)  here .  (Actually, what I said a minute ago wasn't strictly true; there was also one Yahoo search last night for "Rachel Padden" - my maiden name - but I know that was my mum. To be fair, she did warn me she was going to try and find my website but for some reason I wasn't smart enough to remove all the swear words and other *controversial* stuff before she saw it. Oops.)
It would appear that yesterday's plea for links and/or Blogshare purchases has actually had something of a positive response. So I feel it's only fair that I return the favour with links back (with the added bonus that they are actually both definitely worth a read even if they HADN'T been nice to me):   Confessions of a Salivator   Anyhoo   And in case that weren't already enough to cheer me up, I also managed to buy a decent pair of jeans today; they fit, they look good and I didn't have to get a remortgage to pay for them. (Trust me, if you've ever tried to buy maternity clothes, you'll understand what an enormous achievement that really is.)  Can things get any better?
I know it's probably just a combination of boredom, tiredness and hormones but I'm feeling really pissed off today. I haven't the energy to go out and there's nothing to do at home except either watch TV (despite having about 300 channels the best thing on this afternoon is The Father Dowling Mysteries, which says a lot) or mess about with this damn thing.   Speaking of this damn thing; having been averaging about 20 hits a day for the first week or two it is now averaging about 3 hits a day, which isn't helping my mood. Now I'm under no illusions about what a boring pile of crap it is, but there are plenty of even worse ones that can at least manage double figures. I think I shall have to become a search engine whore (yes, even more than I already have) and use *interesting* keywords like "porn" and "XXX" to try and generate some interest.   In the meantime, though, if you've even vaguely enjoyed my blog then PLEASE link back to it. And if you don't have a blog of your own, go buy some of my  Blogshares . They're really good value, honest!
I am now officially half-way through being pregnant - 20 weeks today! Hooray!  USELESS INFO THAT REALLY WON'T INTEREST ANYONE BUT ME: my baby is now approximately 25cm long and weighs just under 1lb. It can touch, hear, smell and taste. As well as being able to move its limbs (including fingers and toes) it can also open and close its eyes, swallow, hiccup and yawn. Over the next couple of weeks it will start to recognise my voice, and will be able to smile, frown and cry.  On the off-chance you ARE interested, you can find some pretty cool 3-D ultrasound photos  here . (Not of my baby, of course. Of random inferior ones.)
Here are&nbsp;some of my&nbsp;favourite quotes (that I can think of at the moment, anyway; if you come back in a few days you'll probably find I've changed them all). I know a few of them are&nbsp;rather pretentious but I like them. And what's the point of having a blog if it isn't to inflict pointless crap like this&nbsp;on others?   Blue M&M, red M&amp;M; they all wind up the same color in the end.   Homer Simpson    This above all, to thine own self be true.  And it must follow, as the night the day;  Thou canst not then be false to any man.   Polonius (from "Hamlet")    I want to die peacefully in my sleep like my father, not screaming and terrified like his passengers.   Unknown    Don’t waste your time on jealousy; sometimes you’re ahead, sometimes you’re behind......the race is long and, in the end, it’s only with yourself.   Baz Luhrmann   &nbsp;  Maybe,&nbsp;just once, someone will call me "Sir" without adding "you're making a scene".   Homer Simpson - again    In this life you can be oh so smart or&nbsp;oh so pleasant.&nbsp;For years I was smart; I recommend pleasant.   Elwood P. Dowd (from "Harvey") &nbsp;   And my current favourite (for obvious reasons):   Life is tough enough without having someone kick you from the inside.&nbsp;   Rita Rudner
I used to be a&nbsp;huge fan of Leeds Rhinos when I was a teenager but drifted away from them when I went to Uni; I usually get to one or two matches a season now but that's all (compared to almost every home First Team, Alliance and A
