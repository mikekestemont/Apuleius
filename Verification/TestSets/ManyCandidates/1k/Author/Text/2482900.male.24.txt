Following the infamous incident with our boy Matt, WVCW management decided that the best thing for them to do was ban all variety format talk shows.  Basically if you didn't focus on the music, then you didn't get a show.  In the Spring of 1998, the station's new Program Director, Derrick A! decided that a morning show would be allowed to have the variety format, so he approached two members of his staff about doing the show.  Those members formed the longest running gimmick on WVCW in years, Milton and the Posse.  So actually it was called  The Morning Show with Milton and his Posse  and every Monday and Wednesday morning at 7 o'clock Milton the Albino Love Machine and his sidekick Cool Dr. Money would provide news, comedy, music and more.  Early on in the show they decided that they should have theme days.  So due to the vast collection of 80s music and cover songs they had,  80's Mondays  and  Cover Wednesdays  were born.  Every Monday for the second half of the show, the duo would play 80's songs ranging from Wham! to Kajagoogoo.  It didn't matter.  The same went for the Wednesday time slot, where any cover of a song were open to be played.  The show also saw the birth of  The Piece of Astor .    Both of the personalities on the show needed to take a short break in the middle of the show to smoke or do something else, so they discovered this CD left over from the station's world music days.  It contained a 14 minute song by a man named  urlLink Astor Piazzolla  who was in fact an accordion play.  So, at the halfway point of each show, they would play the Piece of Astor sounder and be off.  Astor Piazzolla wasn't the only piece of the old world music the Morning Show would utilize.  One morning Milton stumbled across a disc by the band  urlLink Pizzicato Five .  He picked a song called "Happy end of the world" and played it for the people.  The song was so uptempo and fun, that the entire studio began to dance.  From that show on, every Wednesday Milton and the Posse would dance to the Pizzicato to close out the show.  They even grabbed people off the sidewalk out front to join in.    About halfway through the semester, Milton and the Posse had recruited several new members to the crew.  Sara Johnson was brought in as the News girl.  She brought an excellent ability to deliver the news and ability to play straight man to Milton.  She was the perfect foil for him, and the chemistry between the trio of Milton, Money, and Sara was never matched by any of her replacements in the coming years.  One morning as Sara was reading a story about the still recent death of Princess Diana, the mentioned that reports said people could hear Diana yelling out the name of her dead boyfriend before she died.  As the story was being read, quietly at first then much louder, Milton began yelling Dodi, Dodi, Doooodiiiiii.  Sara finished her news report, maintained her composure as much as she could and proved that she may very well have been the most professional one on that entire show.  No wonder she left after that semester.    The Morning Show was always trying to think of ways to self promote.  At the time, no one was really promoting their show, and those who were had cheesy fliers that looked like they were made by a ten year old kid with a dot matrix printer.  Since everyone else had cheap looking ads, the Morning Show decided that their advertisement would consist of two parts, fliers and remote broadcasts.  The fliers for the show set the standard for what WVCW fliers would become.  They consisted of an image of some kind (in this case Brak and Eric Cartman), and a funny tagline.  The remotes were also original.  Around March of 1998, the Posse decided to do a contest where you could Win Your Weight in Pennies, and the remote would focus on that contest.     Up next what happened with the Penny Promotion, as well as eviction, corruption, apathy, and resurrection.

So I began working at the college radio station at VCU in the Fall of 1997.  It had a pretty kick ass location, and okay studio, and a window that looked out onto the common area in front of the building.  By the end of that year, all of that would be gone, and the rebuilding would begin.  University red tape, mismanagement, controversy, and lawsuits laid the groundwork for the demise of a once popular institution.  The station would find itself mired in obscurity, that still haunts it to this day.  The Fall Semester 1997, started off the same as any normal year would at WVCW.  There was a new General Manager, a new Program Director, and a bunch of eager young air personalities just waiting to have their voices heard.  One such personality was a young man we will just call Matt.  Now Matt thought that he was hot sh*t.  Matt had been a caller on Howard Stern's radio show several times.  He thought that gave him experience, and a buddy in Stern.  He was wrong.  Now you see ol' Matt got himself a little radio show with a couple of his buddies.  Matt decided that he could very well be the next Howard Stern, so he needed to model his show off of the one of his idol.  He did some stupid gimmicks and took some calls, but on one October day he went too far.  Matt, decided it would be fun to do a sketch mocking a guy who lived on his dorm room floor.  The guy who shall remain nameless, was a dance major at VCU, a
