I think I may be being too much, is calling you practically every day overdoing it? I don't do it because I feel that I have to. It's just that whenever I sit down near a phone I'm compelled to pick it up and ring you just so I can hear you and so that I know that you're there... but... sometimes I wonder whether you want to hear me. Admittedly I left when you called, felt like I was a bit rude then.. nehoo. Pidgeons are on the roof :S
Erm yes... well btw after pondering I was curious it isn't just for exercise no? But hmm. Treacle tart and cream :)
*Sighs contentedly* Funday, munchday. Huggles :) Ooooh Ooooh I can play Hallelujah, I was just singing it just now, to myself obviously since people wince when I sing infront of them :P hehehe stupid people. Munch can play the piano better than me I felt a bit bitter about that until I realised it was Munch so then I just felt proud... Quite why I felt proud I don't know. Oh yeah and I found out I'm faster than a squirrel cos I was gaining on it before it ran up the tree... that was on my way to buy some cheese. I've nothing to do tomorrow :( Well what I mean is I'm not seeing anybody tomorrow which sucks :( But I'm getting some new shoes, which is fun :) Anyhoo I'm going to play Hallelujah again... bet I've forgotten though... plus my piano suck's compared to the piano of Munch (Munchs Piano looked wrong)
You know what get's to me? Being ignored, it makes me feel insignificant. Most times when I'm feeling insignificant I crawl into a hole and feel like dieing. Not when I'm being ignored, if I'm ignored I get angry, really fucking pissy. (Refrains from putting in bitchy comments/Cruel repertoire designed to cut and make some fucking(refrains) bleed). Raar. Annoyed.  Raar Raar
I'll refrain from saying where are you since you have just appeared... yay :) I'm sleepy drunk mind. Not real drunk just lazy. Feel hug n kisses :) xhx
Yay exam today :S Slightly worried. I've revised Memory, Abnormality, Psychological Principles... No really I have I actually know them quite well. I've only read through the notes on Social Influence, Research Methods and Attachments... hmmm I'm either gonna do good... or more likely Shit. But yay! Munch on Friday :)
*Stretches* Ahh done so much work today :) I feel so clever... okay so I don't actually remember any of it, the only thing that's stuck in my head is Tulving (1982)... which sucks. I get paid on Friday which is funky munky :) I'm gonna spend it ALL... again... whoops :S :P Thanks Alex but I really don't think that you understand me very well :P Oh well you are foolish. Munki's gonna ask out Alex which is sweet methinks espesh since she's been talking about him non-stop for the past god only knows how long :P Awwww
You are like all the colours of the rainbow, from pink through to yellow... okay so rainbows aren't my forte either. Thank you your loverly. Your texts made me smile and laugh which was impressive considering that I was near screaming at miscomprehension of Psychology. Huggles Munch. You of course don't understand how sorry I was that I couldn't come round today, I know you don't believe me but I do feel bad when I don't really bad, kinda like I hate myself so much so bad, bad. Yes. I'm so sleeeeepy but that's okay cos I've done TONNES of revision... can't remember half of it but I DON'T CARE! so hah... hah... he.. h.. oh. Sweet Nightmares... maybe I won't eat so much just before going to bed this time and I won't get traumatised.
The worst thing about your world being turned upside-down is knowing that it's only upside-down because of your own irrepressible idiocies. These Idiocies which go on to hurt, annoy or irritate other people who you have no right to have such an effect upon. Masochism is a form of self pity with which for a while I was acquainted, however to a degree the declamations against society, myself and other people are also. I had a dream last night that I lost you, I didn't have you, and it hurt.
Good Morning. Good Afternoon. Good Evening and Goodnight. Now why the hell aren't there any in between? Good morning lasts from 7 till 12. Afternoon from 12 till 6. Good Evening from 6 - 12. Goodnight... well depends on how kinky you feel. Now I believe that if it's just before 12 there should be something else you can say cos it pisses me off. Great Uncle Johnny and his wife are here, damn he's talkative I was speaking non stop for about 30 minutes all the while trying to be interested. Nah he's funky really. Oooh and Munki might have sorted out her love life. Invariably she won't have though. Philips trying to whip me with a  skipping rope :S Yay Nickelback on the 18th :) Good luck to everyone doing Pure Maths AS.
Mmmm Munch. You make me so unbelievably happy, from the depressed boy to a teenager in love... I like it :) Love you. I had a lot of fun today even if there were mitigating restrictions on it, which weren't your fault xhxhx cuddles. Alexandra I must say you are a fool... I can't remember whether I used those lyrics or changed to less scathing ones but myeh :P
Here it is  The situation: under 24 hours till my practical exam Feelings about exam: Not worried it's basically following instructions and knowing details of microscopic slides Feelings: Depressed, angry, irritated, tired.  As you can see a bit of a problem, I can't do the exam knackered can I? And I'm working tonight so I can't just goto bed early. I probably won't get anything to eat cos mum shouted at me about using "her food" in "her kitchen". So I'm going t
