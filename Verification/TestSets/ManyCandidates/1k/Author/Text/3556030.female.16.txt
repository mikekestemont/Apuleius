The boys are back in town...  Well I am back from a very "educational" (hehe to people who know what that means) and fun trip from Boston. Boston is an extremely beautiful place and I recommend that all people should go there before they die. But unfortunately I am not in the mood for blogging and if you interested in talking about it give me a jingle. You know the digits and if not just ask!
Leaving on a Jet plane, can't say when I'll be back again.      Bye all leaving for Boston, softball with my favorite people, Erika and Kayli! Woohoo go Lisle Slammers!     Love to all and will miss every last one of you!
Everyone quits their first job.   Working gives me the sense of how do you say-----yuck. I mean honestly if the world didn't have money or material items I think it would be a better place. Who really needs that top notch car or those fancy mechanical pencils...not I! I for one, would be happier without all these things. Everyone would be equal and wouldn't have to work stupid jobs and wear "interesting" outfits to work in. I experienced my first taste of the working world this weekend. And it stinks. But the one advantage is meeting new people and I did like that (along with the free food benifits). I guess truely the only part I hated about it was the fact that I had to keep on my fake smile for the customers so all would be happy, because lets face it no one wants to buy a elephant ear from a sad frowny person. Oh and did I forget to mention that I am a carnie? Yes, it looks that way.    Going on the whole smiling-makes-the-worldgo-'round-and-money-come-in attitude that the people of Bojo's seem to have has made me realize that we segreate. Really now folks, how many carnies selling elephant ears have you seen with piercings and spiked hair? I know I haven't seen many, not one. Well maybe I should change that. Would I get fired? Would I set a fire with my crazy spiked hair and all the hairspray that would be necessary to keep those spikes in? Who knows. But all I know is that I want to change that. For all you spikey haired punk like people I represent you and truely in my heart root for you to get that job over me! I believe in you! But I must say that the one true punk-like person that gets a job everytime because she is loved by all is Rachel Cherny. That girl has skills! Everyone loves her, so all you punks listen up and follow by her example and soon enough you too can make money and join the rest of us wokring people in the real world! What fun I'll see ya there!    So truely the lesson of my experience has been:   If you want a job, you better not be a punk!
Colleen   C Confused O Orderly L Loving L Luscious E Emotional E Excellent N Neglected      Got this from my beloved friend Dylan!! Your my hero! Mad skills at the shucking!
I'm still afraid to feel, can't risk getting hurt again...  My feelings at the moment right now. Not much to say will respond later. Great summer so far kiddos!
C.O.O.L-Constipated, Outta style, Outrageous, Loser  I believe that in life it's too short to become something that your not. You shouldn't go on living the life that was made for someone else, live your own life. Don't be what your friends want you to be, but instead be you. Giving up into peer pressure is one thing, but when you go on doing it to be cool, it's just plain outta-style. Live the life you want to remember 20 years from now and not regret it. Sure you may lose some friends in this process, but if they didn't know you as this person then they never really were you friends. You'll make new ones, better than the old. Be who you are, because God knows being cool won't get you anywhere.
A picture holds a 1000 words.  Today was a lazy day, chilling with Kayli and watching home movies last night until 4:00 in the morning. After volleyball I became lazy and felt like looking into my past. I opened my pictures from old dances and turned on a little bit of Yellowcard--One Year, Six Months, and other good gazing-at-photo songs. Looking into these pictures and the great memories that they hold I wish I could relive the moment. But, I can't. The people within those pictures and memories have changed and I know we will all eventually go our own ways as life goes on but I hate thinking about that now. Honestly, when I am an old woman living in my little tiny house on a hill will I look back and remember the good..or the bad. The changes that certain people made in my life for the better or for the worse. Who will I still be friends with, if any when I'm older. If stats are correct which they usually are at least 5 people in our class will die before we graduate. Think about that how scary is that fact. There will be at least 5 less people that we are with now at graduation. Who will those people be? Will they be close to me, or will I have barely knew them? With all of these thoughts rushing through my head at the computer needless to say I was a bit freaked out. So the conclusion of this is that truely some people will change your life, be it for the better or worse. Who will those people be, you are the only one who can determine that. So get out there and meet those people, get off your butt and off my blog! Live life to the fullest and never look back wishing you had done something that you didn't.
Until the day I die I'll spill my heart for you.  I f
