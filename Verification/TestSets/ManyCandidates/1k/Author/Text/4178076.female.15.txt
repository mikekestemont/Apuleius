So, today was get ready for camping day, which means that I won't be blogging for a week. I will keep a journal and enter them when I get home, however. Today I woke up and put on my work cloths (including the pick nick shirt which always gets questions when I wear it for load in or n e thing) Then Rachel came and I went to the library for books for the trip. I got Oliver Twist and Fehrenhieght 451 for summer reading. I also have Ethan Frome kicking around. I am not sure what I will read. I also got the 2nd newest xanth book, which I have not read yet and an older one which I really want to read and a few other things. We are probably going to listen to books on CD on the way up though. Then I worked on packing up kitchen things. This whole time, of course, we were watching the Olympics. I don't like summer Olympics as much as winter Olympics but you gotta watch! Then after becoming VERY TIRED we ate dinner and watched some of Reign of Fire. (an excellent movie in witch Matthew McConaughey plays someone butch for a change) Now I have come online to blog. I am so annoyed that I still haven't got to talk to Ben! Now I may never know what I wanted to tell him! I also need to call Andrew while I am away. He's been really busy and I've been really sad! Well love to Ben and Andrew! I will talk to you guys soon. So I cannot believe that i forgot to tell you the most important news of like my entire life. Yesterday my father told his boss that he was leaving. This makes it real! He cannot chicken out! I love Rachel and Christian but the fact that dad lives out here kind of makes my life miserable except for the fact that I get to see them. Rachel is coming camping with me so that is really awesome. It won't be so boring. But anyways the first time my father told me he was leaving MI I actually cried tears of joy. I have never cried tears of joy before! I will miss Rachel and Christian so much but God! I am so happy. But It's also weird to look around at all of these places that I have seen my whole life and realize that I may never see them again. April may have been the last time I will ever see the butterflies at Frederick Meijer Garden. Next week may be the last time I will ever go to the Kava house. A week from Friday will be the last time I ever see Dad's apartment. After all these years (15 years 7 months and 24 days) it seems like I could never leave. I love you especially to Christian and Rachel and to my HCT friends and Marissa and everyone else who reads this blog and all my other friends!. Have wonderful weeks and I will see you on Monday. (for my last Monday in MI)
I didn't have time to blog yesterday because I went to bed really early. Yesterday I went to the Kava house with Christian, Rachel, and Jeremiah. I had a diet coke and the 4 of us split a cookie. (it was a big cookie) Then we walked to Rachel's house. We started watching Kill Bill Volume 2. I hated it a lot. It was so boring. Then Joe came over and he and Rachel got into a long discussion in the back room and Christian and I psycho analyzed Rachel for a while. Christian got really mad. Then Jeremiah left and Christian and I ended up sitting outside. Then Christian got mad and left. He was mad at me because I wouldn't leave with him. I mean Rachel was clearly having a problem with her boyfriend and I think that if we had anything to say to her, it needed to wait until she wasn't fighting with Joe. Then Joe and Rachel resolved what they needed to resolve and we hung out. It was a lot of fun. I have never had a problem with Joe, I think Christian wants me to hate him, because Christian hates him. Then Joe went home and Rachel went to band practice and I went home. Then dad and I had pizza and watched some of Addams family values. That movie is so funny. Christiana Ricci has all the best lines in that movie. ( Amanda Buckman : Why are you dressed like somebody died?  Wednesday : Wait. ) Then I went to bed at about 10:45. This morning I woke up at 10:30. I watched some ER (the one where Abby deals with her mothers Manic depressive disorder) It was disturbing for me. Then i did some packing and some laundry (oooh fun) and watched some Lord of the Rings extras and I watched emperors club and now I am watching the commentary. And I still haven't had a chance to talk to Ben! I did talk to Kimmy on the phone and yea... He's odd. I miss HCT a lot. It's so sad. You spend you're whole year waiting for these five weeks and then before you can even blink it's over. I hate that. And who knows when I will have another chance to see all these people. And the really scary thing? I almost always know what my next show is and this time I really don't. I was going to SM for The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. Heather had asked me to earlier in the year but now she is not directing it. I have emailed Rick about it but they don't have a director yet. I am really hoping to get to work on it and I hope a lot of the kids will too. Especially the kids who have graduated from Discovery Company. They are really great kids and I hope t
