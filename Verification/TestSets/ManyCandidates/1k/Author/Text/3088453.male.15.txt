Verity's opinion...  The Aboriginal community say they are regularly assaulted and are the subject of racism from the police, they witness violent raids and so it is obvious why Thomas tried to avoid the police. He merely did what any aboriginal boy of his age would do. Thomas' family say that the December before his death Thomas was accused of a crime that he didn't commit which gives an even stronger reason why he was so determined to get away from the police. Because there are so many conflicting accounts of the circumstances of Thomas' death it is unknown whether the police actually were chasing him but it is known that the NSW police had a track record for racism against the Aborigine’s, which is not justified. But even though they have a track record for this, it is not every member of the police force and it is unfair to say that this was another one of their racist action, as it could easily be that the police were just sitting there looking for another aboriginal boy whose description did not fit Thomas’s, and therefore they didn’t run after him. It could have just been Thomas’s misjudgement and the fear that drove him to cycle away at high speed and hence have the accident.  Bob Carr has made public that his support lies with the police and does not believe that they were of any cause to the death of Thomas, but I believe that Bob Carr as an authority figure should not back anyone as he does not know any information for certain as the facts are inconsistent. Also as it is a time where many people are willing and determined for reconciliation and a public apology to the Aboriginals for what our ancestors did, Bob Carr although he may have been supporting the police, shouldn't have made it public because of the uproar it would cause not just from the Aboriginals but also from other Australians as it is not a step towards reconciliation.
urlLink    The death of Thomas (Tj) Hickey, a young Aboriginal boy of only 17 years has been of great conflict. TJ died while riding his bicycle, the exact circumstances of his death are unknown but it is sure that the New South Wales police force either directly or indirectly played a critical role in circumstances leading up to the death of the Sydney resident. The police force has record of racism and provocative behavior towards the Aboriginal community. The young boy, who was the eldest of seven children is a good example of the terrible social and economic deprivation of the aborigine's even today, although they are just youth and a  younger generation of aborigine's.  it is known that after riding his BMX to his mothers house TJ encountered the police, he rode away at high speed and soon after in doing so he fell off his bike, he fell on a metal fence and impaled himself. The police deny ever chasing TJ but they do admit that they did encounter him a short while before he crashed. The p
