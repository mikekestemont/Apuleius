Well my first day probably won't start officially till tomorrow seems i think i have well and truly blown it this weekend :) but i did have a chicken salad for lunch if that counts.   Exercise wise, i am mainly going to use the gym downstairs i've been using it off and on and there is a pool as well but i'm not really comfortable swimming just yet and there is the small problem that i need new swimmers so maybe once thats resolved i'll start swimming as well. I've also started a food plan, and might start an exercise plan as well, as maybe i will stick to it more if i set it out and i think as long as i exercise more and eat less i should be doing ok.  Seems i don't really want to list my weight for the whole world to see just at the moment :) i'll just say my goal weight for the moment is 70 kilos (165.5 pounds) and i'll reasess from there, but i remember i was that when i was in Israel and i was pretty happy with how i looked so...Good Luck to me and Leslie and Aleta and anyone else that joins!
Today I begin....well sorta....I am sitting here getting ready to actually plan a menu for this next week. I want to buy the book, Eat Right 4 Your Blood Type, but at the new store its pretty expensive. I did find the website though, and it looks like there are some support forums, so that will be nice. I also need to come up with some sort of exercise program. I love swimming, but there's a little issue of finding a pool that I can use. I like walking, so I may decide to walk during my lunch break at work...which means I have to plan and make sure I have a lunch with me each day instead of running to Walmart to get something at the last moment.
A while ago when i started talking about going on a diet for the wedding, Andrew said as my reward if i could lose 10kilos by June 3rd he would give me a day at a spa: facials, massages the works :) so that is what my reward is to myself and also one of my earlier goals... I have lots of goals i guess but some seem to intermingle with the others: Goal 1 would be to try and lose a kilo a week which seems to be what most people recommend Goal 2 is to get down 10 kilos so i can have my reward :) Goal 3 is to be 70 kilos, and with that my main goal of all is to not be a fat bride! I have just over a year to reach that goal so i should be ok as long as i have the restraint from food and the motivation to exercise.  So next sunday i'll be able to blog if i lost weight or put on weight or stayed the same!  This week was a bit up and down i exercised which was good but food wasn't consistant, have to stop getting these secret shopper jobs that involve pizza *G*  I have started craving soups lately though for some odd reason so bought some of them and i'm starting the total wellbeing diet next week so we'll just see how it goes.  Hope everyone has a good "healthy" week :)
I recently started a diet and excercise plan (about a month ago).  However, it's turned into excerciseless diet.  It was easier for me to stick to a healthier eating plan because I gave up my detrimentally cherished vices with serious committment to encourage my mother in her efforts to quit smoking.  Soo-o-oo-o, I enjoyed some initial weight loss. But, when the excercising came to a complete halt and I wasn't as strict with my eating..my weight loss also came to a screeching halt.  In fact, I even put back on three of the lost pounds.  Of course, its encouraging to know this weight loss plan works for me, but it is also frustrating to know my body is so resistant to weight loss that I could gain when I'm still eating better than before.  In order for me get past this obstacle, I think I will have to do more than put down my stress elixer, Dr. Pepper(a super sweet soda).   I need to again eat smarter and EXERCISE REGULARY.  Here we go!  Thanks everyone for an accountability outlet.
I have to 'fess up -- now -- that I won't actually start this until the beginning of April.  I absolutely HAVE to get my neck / shoulder / arm thing fixed before I can even begin to think about regular exercise or planning or anything.  Devoting three nights to PT plus one night and maybe one weekend morning to massage therapy, plus work, just leaves no pain-free space.  And I am not going to wander Europe saying "Gee, maybe I shouldn't eat that pastry!"  However, I am SO glad that Grey decided to start this and that we can keep it going.  I have, upon reflection, realized that I need to set action goals, not result goals.  That is, my goal can't be "lose X pounds" or "lose X inches" or "wear size X."  It has to more like "Go to gym X times" or "Cook healthy meals X times" or "Bring in lunch X times."  But I like the idea of rewards for goals.  The problem is that I pretty much buy myself what I want, when I want it.  Which isn't good fiscal discipline, come to think of it.  So I'm going to be thinking about actions, action goals, and rewards.  I'll get back to you!
Ok, so   some  of us have talked about our goals...but what about our rewards? What is your reward for yourself? Is it a trip? An afternoon off?  After much thought (ok not really), it finally dawned on me what a great reward would be. a).Clothes w
