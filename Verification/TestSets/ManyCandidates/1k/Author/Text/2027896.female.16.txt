I have a new phone now.  Yay!  It is a camera phone, too, so most likely I will be seeking your picture soon.  Why, you ask?  Well, then I can program it where whenever you call me, your happy picture will pop up and then I will push the ignore button.  Ha, just kidding.  Maybe.  *chuckle*  Anyhoo, the days to Honor's Choir dwindle down and I get more and more excited.  I can't wait to wear my dress for all to see!  *skips*  Oh, and singing too.  Yeah.  Haha.  I also can't wait to feel the power of singing in an amazing choir.  It has been a while since I have done that.  Today I got a haircut and I have bangs now!  Exciting, eh?  I think so.  They're not creepy uniform bangs though.  I like them and I think you will too.  At least, you will if you ever want me to talk to you again.  Ha, just kidding.  Maybe.
-- Didn't you know, You are not allowed to speak of...*cough* school *cough*...during the summer time. There is no such thing. I proclaim your, "topic", nullified. Why even bring up such a thing....      Always,    Jacob
So school is coming soon and we have no choice but to go back. Not that we wouldn't want to eventually go back, but that if it could be prolonged, I'm sure we all would gladly push it back. This school year isn't going to be bad or anything. It is just going to be very stressful, but at the same time  so much fun!  Parts of me will miss this past year. Being a junior was the most fun I've had... ever. So then, I guess we can assume that senior year will be all the better. Between Concert Choir, Show Choir, San Francisco, and Drama, not to mention all the numerous random fun activities there will be throughout the year, I don't think I have to worry about not having enough fun with all of you crazy fun people. So until the next post.   {Geoffrey}
Hello, this is your Receptionist Chase Daniel.&nbsp; How can... ((ring)) ((ring))&nbsp; Excuse me just one moment please.  Okay, I'm back.&nbsp; Now how may I help you?&nbsp; Oh, you would like a new topic eh?&nbsp; Okay... let me type that up on the computer here ((type sounds)).&nbsp; Ah yes, topics... hmm.&nbsp; Oh, here is a juicy one!&nbsp; School is starting up in less than a month.&nbsp; Is anyone out there ready?&nbsp; Believe me, I'm not.&nbsp; Bah college.&nbsp; Well, let me know what you think.&nbsp; And as always, have a terrific day!
Yes, that is what I shall be. The Keeper of the Keys. *holds them high for everyone to see* INDEED. I decided that I like this blog because it let's me be ponderish, one of my favorite things to be, and then I get to see what people think without clicking on the comments button. Let's toast to that.   This is for my Katie: Will you be my warmie? *cheesy smile*   To everyone: Hey, I dare you to move.  Why is it that we spend so much time in&nbsp;a hurry to grow up but then when we finally get there we wish we could be young again? Is it because we wear diapers when we're small but once again when we're wrinkly? Why is it that I sit here, finally looking at my senior pictures, wondering where my life went? It seems as if these last few years have been on a&nbsp;slight fast forward and now it's only going to get faster. I wanted so badly to grow up, but now I find that I'm just a little bit scared to grow up the rest of the way. I hate to bring this up once again, but I find that it crosses my mind quite a bit lately, and I suppose I can't be the only one. I have officially finished my first senior thing and now I think I'm ready. I'm ready to actually classify myself as a senior. Indeed. Louisa Mae Soli-Holt&nbsp; has proclaimed herself a senior, one year away from starting her first year of college. I think I can handle that. I hope I can anyway. =)  This being the end of this post, good byes are in order. Look for a long survey on my blog...  urlLink www.jiggymae.blogspot.com  ...in the near future. Come to Coldstone on Thursday night and see me all dressed up. Smile a lot because it'll get you through the hard stuff and accentuate the best stuff. Remember that I love you. Because I do. Okay? Okay. =)  **Louisa**
A neat post from me to all of you who are also typing on this dealie. Love you all much much much! =)
Wow, Chase, that's a very interesting question. It sounds fairly logical to me but, somehow, it doesn't. I think it mainly depends on the persons' attitude. I dhunno, really. I guess my answer is False. Good question! Bye!
Hey all... I just wanted to run an idea past you guys.&nbsp; Would anyone be interested in coming to a party at my house in Brandon the Saturday before school starts?&nbsp; That would be the 28th of August.&nbsp; Umm... yeah... leave a comment or a post and let me know what you think and perhaps I will set it into motion.  --Ashley M.

I think that the statement may be true and false at the same time.&nbsp; I agree for the most part with what Sean said.&nbsp; It's understandable that a person may be quiet around their friends and talkative with their loved one because the reason they are that person's loved one is because they feel they can be the most open and comfortable with them.&nbsp; Make sense?&nbsp; But, as Sean so eloquently stated, it depends on the situation and who is around.&nbsp; Bottom line, sometimes people to crazy things and are entirely unpredictable and not able to be&nbsp;summed up in&nbsp;one sentence.&nbsp; So... Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is my quite possibly indecipherable standpoint.&nbsp;    --Ashley M. Ludewig--
Well, in response to Katie's question: yes katie, I think it should be b
