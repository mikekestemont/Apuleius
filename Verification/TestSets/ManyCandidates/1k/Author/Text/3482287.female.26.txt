Someone recently asked me "what really gets you off?"  - well that's obvious I thought .. but then it hit me if I could have one last sexual experience for my entire lifetime what would that experience be?  And then wouldn't that experience truly be what would get me off?  Which got me to thinking if I never figure out the things I want to try - how will I ever know to try them?  Logically I need to document these grand ideas, these whimsies, these sordid fantasies and tantalizing details.  And that is what brought me here today.  For my delightful inspiration I have decided to ideally explore three ideas ... so with baited breath and anxious pen (in no order of importance of course!):  1) What has been my best/most intense sexual experience to date?  Why and could that experience ever be recreated? 2) What is my one fantasy of longing that I know I could someday make a reality? 3) If I could have one last sexual experience, no realities holding me back (but of course logic playing a role) what would that experience be?  On our next encounter I shall attempt to flesh out some serious debate on question #1.  Although I know what experience will win, there are elements of others I feel I need to discuss and yes ultimately take the time to savor over again...  Till we meet again. XOXO
It seems I always have brilliant thoughts and no one to share them with.... Perhaps this is the way for me to go.  It is official I am addicted to MSN, lavalife and coffee.  I lack real physical human contact and fear becoming a hermit.  Why you ask?  If I knew I obviously wouldn't seek the eyes of strangers reading my words and thoughts.  I find that at times I seek sympathy from my now married friends, and yet at other points I find myself celebrating my aloneness.  But how much self love is too much?
Well it appears that Canada did its best to muddle through the non-sense of yesterdays election .. and an exciting time is sure to be ahead of us.  But enough about politics .. because at least for now we are free of become part of the USA.  Another sigh of relief because I think I am finally coming to the conclusion that somethings gotta give ... and that something can't be a complete mental and physical break down.  I have gone non-stop for three years and it's time that I have some fun again.  MMMmmm and what delicious fun it will be.  I have no fears, because I know that all of the yummy fantasies I have dreamt up are soon to come true.  It's amazing when you meet your sexual match.  And it's even more amazing when they have the potential to be your emotional and intellectual match as well.  Tonight I am going to sit down with my babblings and flesh out some concrete ideas about what I want to write about and explore.  As you can tell I have been distracted lately .. mind you it's been worth it .. but its time to get back to my goals.  I hope that the boy ;-) will be part of the process and understand when I do have to pull back at times to get things accomplished.  So tomorrow my pretties its back to our roots, back to the exploration and examination of life, sex and web cams.    XO
Today is election day in Canada.  I hope that all those who could did vote.  On the way to the ballot box I had a crazy thought ... with all the insane reality TV shows that have a voting process why can't we run our government the same way?    Better yet can I have my own personal panel of judges and tribunal councils that determine my next moves?  That way when I am faced with a life changing event it's not me that has to take the blame!  For instance should I keep both my jobs - the panel discusses this ... tense music.. drum roll and then their answer "well your performance in both has been stunning, but the audience has spoken, you must leave the one job, thank you bye-bye".  Ahhh wouldn't that be grand!  In my dream world I wouldn't have to be working right now.  I could be fully engrossed in my documentary while still studying part time.  I could go where ever I needed to get the doc made, and my Alistair would come with me ...  But in reality I know I will continue this insane break neck work schedule ... scatter my studying between jobs, hope that I have a few hours left in the week to sleep, work on the doc and see the boy ...  *sigh* at some point somethings gotta give.
How can you explain passion?  Is it a quality a person can possess or an action they exhibit, or perhaps a feeling that overwhelms you?  The warm fuzzy bunnies that were hopping in the field can only distract for so long.  Eventually you become overwhelmed by your feelings (physically and mentally) and it happens.  No worries and certainly no regrets.  This weekend I saw passion, I felt passion and for the first time in forever I had passion touch me, caress me, savour me ...  Every touch more intense, every emotion swirling closer to love.  Is it love, of course, it is budding deep in my heart and flowing over in my mind.  But it was lust too, fun, playful, mind blowing.  So right and so comfortable on every level.    On the way home we found a playing card ... the ace of hearts ...  turns out the cards are speaking of our destiny.  Ace of hearts: The home, love, friendship, joy the start of a romance.  When it feels this good it can't be wrong.
I am sitting here eating cherries ... giggling for many reasons.  Of course the whole connotation of a cherry brings up numerous chuckles.  But w
