I had the fortunate and rare opportunity of seeing Eric Clapton last monday evening. Here is a review of my experience at Madison Square Garden:  If Frederick Nietzsche were alive today he wouldn’t say God is dead. He would probably say God isn’t dead; God is Eric Clapton-especially after hearing his performance of “Cocaine” at Madison Square Garden. What is the commonality that draws people into such a transect state of revelry and adoration when one of rock’s greatest commands the stage? I am typing this at 2 in the morning, buzzing from experiencing 2 and a half solid hours of Eric Clapton and his guitar wizardry. And in this excited nocturnal state I am left to ponder a mystique that is able to hypnotize a crowd of some 20, 000.   My good friend and former roommate, Benny From the Bronx invited me to the show. We’ve sung our poorly out of tuned hearts many times to Clapton’s songs before. We’ve lamented over the tragic construction that belabored Eric while composing “Layla” and “Tears In Heaven”. We’ve pontificated his life and career, always coming to the same irrefutable conclusion-Eric is a genius and his musical evolution is one of tremendous rarity. But until witnessing him in person, did we fully grasp the implications that music such as this is truly the “opiate of the masses.”   After the show, Ben and I found a grungy deli in Manhattan’s Midtown to further analyze our concert going experience. It’s always easy to speak of Mr. Clapton’s performances in the kind of third person distance that characterizes a legend. In our eyes, his exploits could be as legendary as that King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table.    Sir Eric, with his white Fender wielding electric sounds against the dark forces of Brittney Spears and Justin Timberlake. See how he loves fair Layla, and goes to such great lengths as to compose two versions of the same song for her. He and his merry minstrels ride forth across this great land giving the gift of true music to those burdened by the weight of top 40 stations.    Yes, it’s campy and probably a bad variation of a rejected Saturday Night Live skit, but we’ve all fantasized about our heroes of music one way or another. And as always, when the subject of Clapton’s genius comes to an agreeable close, the subjects of how Ben and I have been living our own lives comes to light.    It’s no coincidence that a different version of the same conversation took place with a friend of mine several months prior. We had both been given two tickets to see a pianist in the annex of Carnegie Hall. At 23 years of age, this young man is already being recognized as one of the most talented concert pianists in the modern world. We were in complete awe of his abilities, and fell to a kind of sickening silence after the performance had ended. Why? Well, as my good friend put it-“Because if he’s doing that, and I’m the same age, I should be doing more with my life.”   I desperately wanted Eric Clapton to sing, “Bell Bottom Blues,” tonight. But he didn’t. Instead he played a whole host of songs from his Robert Johnson cover album. It was still incendiary though. (Thank you Almost Famous). A week prior to the concert I listened, no studied, Clapton’s most recent live album. By making note of all the nuances of his songs, I would be ready to strike my air guitar at just the correct moment, to sing at just the precise time.    And I was pretty good, especially when Benny and I bellowed “Sunshine of Your Love,” together like two drunken frat boys. Throughout the course of our friendship we’ve had some weighty conversations of life, but I don’t think we’ve ever connected as deeply as when we’re belting our favorite classic rock verses. What is this sense of comradely that Clapton is able to produce in two hours? Maybe that’s part of his genius, the spell he can cast with a guitar pic and pedal. At any rate he is more of a wizard than guitar prodigy, for his audience was directly feeding on whatever sounds came from his amplifiers.    Ben ordered tea, and I sat down with some carbonated soda that only hummingbirds should drink. Amidst a blaring re-run of Seinfeld, we furthered the topic of our respective life situations. Ben was an accounting major and is now a certified account. Pretty straightforward and to the point, like Ben. I was a film major and have been resorting to working at things like a baby clothing line and editing sixth grade graduation videos. Not so straightforward, but everyone seems to be getting the point.    Ben’s doing his thing, because it’s all he knows right now. He hates his career, but is hoping that with several years of job security under his belt he’ll be able to try something else. I’m trying to get into making movies because its all my heart knows right now. But at the present I can barely make rent, and am wondering if I should have studied something like business management or air conditioning repair.    Whatever our hearts desires and fears are tonight, our hero Eric Clapton haunts us both. And I have a hard time believing it’s because of his talent. On our way to the deli we passed a homeless man, jamming on his electric guitar. In spite of his archaic amp, he was able to produce some incredible sounds. No, I think Ben and I are both inspired and bothered by Clapton’s performance in a way that goes beyond admiration or envy. Someone like Clapton or this 23-year-old piano prodigy remind us of a kind of god-like perfection we don’t have and probably will never attain. Ben is reminded of his slavish cubicle and number crunching. I am reminded of my own fears and setbacks, the what if’s and how’s the plague every artist. These mortals seemed t
