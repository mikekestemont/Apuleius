Good day for family. Spent the day at Doug's to celebrate my cousin Diep's birthday. What is she now.. 24? We're all grown up! Had a big water balloon fight just like when I was a kid.. But now its fair because I'm bigger than everyone. Good food........ Good people.... Played poker.. took everyone's money. Just chillin and shit... I like that.  Yesterday was cool too.. spent the day with Dianne. Paul and Thuy came over to play games... we didn't play anything and watched movies. Collateral was good.. funny though cuz it extracted weird.. think the file's corruted... but i had to do it like 3 times.. and we missed out on like the last 2 minutes.. but that's ok.. Then the other cousin came over... and something happened that will change my life forever...  Ever here of Veet????? That stupid shit for shaving ur legs!!! Omg. They used me as the guinea pig... and it turned out it didn't work very well.. And my leg was all fucked up and weird.. so i had to shave it all off.... But, iono.. my legs are kinda nice and smooth now. Feel kinda sassy and shit.. HAHA!!! Don't make fun!  That's All for right now... I am the Walrus; g00 g00 g'j00b.
Look, I have a better banner. Thanks to Hubert for creating this accurate representation of me, Jimmy Huynh. Look at how hot I am..     Anyhow, I took a nap at eight... and just woke up. I read somewhere that sleeping before your usual time of sleep makes sleep worth more. Like if you sleep during the after noon for 3 hours. 20 minutes of sleep during that time is worth 1 hour of sleep during you usual routine. If this is true, we could all save a lot of time. And stay up all night.. doing things... anyways.. my banner rocks. I bet someone we know would be attracted to that sort of thing... *laugh.  I am so hungry I could eat at Arby's... *laughs. So, I microwaved five corndogs.  And that's my time... I am the Walrus; g00 g00 g'j00b.
We all had a good day today. Went to the block to catch a movie. We had to decide between AVP or Without A Paddle... AVP... Without A Paddle... I didn't really care. Both of those movies didn't seem that good. We all ended up watching AVP; it was better than I thought, but it was still bad--- especially because of the ending. I present an alternate ending. One that I know everyone would enjoy:  Anyways instead of that one predator dying from the alien queen and getting impregnated by her alien seed, he, with the help of the black human chick, defeats the queen in an awesome display of agility and strength. The predators accept the chick as one of there own, and she then travels to there native planet where she is preserved within the alien atmosphere---which is good for your skin---for the next hundred years. She comes back to earth one hundred years later to experience her own hunt. The planet Earth is now more technologically advanced and the human reace was fully aware of the Predator's arrival and intentions for there planet. However our technology could not come close to that of our Predator counter-parts, so it was apprarant that they would die. The incoming Predator fleet was aware of the welcome party they were going to receive when they arrived on earth, and prepared to meet they attack with their own offensive strike. The black former human chick, now evolved and carrying subtle predator features (like hair, denser skin, and bigger hands), hears of the predators plans for attacking her former human companions tries to stop the violence and explains taht she will go down and try and convince the humans not to interfere with the predator's goals. When she meets the humans, she finds that human nature has been corrupted and the government is a worldwide dictatorship under a woman named Lan. The human-predator artificial half-breed meets with Lan to discuss the matter, and she is disgusted to find that she is met with prejudice and is considered a filthy traitor. Now, she holds no sympathies for the human race and her once partial loyalty for the Predator race is solidified on the basis of humans now being corrupted and evil, and her spending more of her life as a predator. Well it turns out, humans are now non existent, because 74 years ago, there was a premature awakening of the Aliens, and they were able to get a hold of a couple of humans, slowly taking over the entire planet. If you watched the old Alien movies, you would know that Aliens could take the form of humans.. INCREDIBLY HOT HUMANS. Lan.. was really hot... really hot! She had a pale complexion blended in with dark features.. like her black eyes, hair, and lips. The predators did not know this and came ill-prepared to defeat what they thought were humans... The first wave of predators sent in mysteriously were defeated. Then they sent in more and more.. and they were defeated. Finally, they sent in the half-breed/former human and her loyal crew, including a punk-ninja predator guy who was like her right hand man. Her husband, that one guy she met on earth a hundred years ago, was now the Predator President: President Mualuapoteaisimbabweikunamatata (NOTICE THE AZTEC SOUNDING SHIT.) They eventually find that they were facing Aliens, and figured out what had been happening these last hundred years. Alien VS. Predator 2: The End War. Long-story-short, the predators win over powering the Alien's with they're big photon cannons and shit. Sorry, I'm getting tired of writing all this shit...  Anyways.. that's the ending... IT'S BETTER HUH.. THE ENDING WOULD BE LONGER THAN THE REST OF THE MOVIE... but it's ok..  Anyways, after the movies we went messing around at the arcade, and played this super cool game where all six of played. We felt like power rangers, we all were in one s
