so here it is
So I'm wondering if anybody is reading this actually, so will anybody that has a second or two please email my new addy:  falcion@gmail.com  Yea, I'm just curious to what all is being read on here.  I haven't posted too much lately, and I am sorry for that, not that there is a mass amount reading here so yea, hehe. I will try to catch back up on this!  O, before I forget about this again, I make art, yea, you heard that right. I make art, well GIFs and alter images like the 4 down there at the bottom of this post. So if anybody wants anything done I can try and do it for them cause yea, it is fun, and I'm practicing at the skills for it all.  Women are evil, evil, creatures... They know they have what us males need and flaunt it. Evil little girls, hehe. Not sure about them though, not that trustworthy... Cannot trust them! Well maybe, I don't know.  Wow, my printer just flipped off! How very special. Speaking of Printers, anybody know how to get an  ALARIS WeeCam  webcamera working? Mine is dead and all and it hates me and won't work right!  That is a good post for right now, I'll think of some more like my Decades project or something to talk about later on.
I've got a new email address!!! YAY! Well not really a new one cause I didn't change email addies but I've added another one to my list of email addies!!! Yea, this new Gmail from Google, I'm testing it out and sofar the only thing I don't like is that process of having to delete email, but because you have so much archive room [1 GB].  Anyhow, I'd say my email but those SPAMer have programs that run the net looking for mailtos
I was going to post but my parents [Mom actually...] is ordering/barking at me to get offline... O well, I'll just post tomorrow then!
Shifting ideas and thoughts. I've been wondering about how my life is going and where it is going too. And to tell the truth, I have no clue. As of right now let me tell you how I stand, from the eyes of somebody that were to look at me on paper:      What is on the Paper:  What this means to people:    6'3‚Äù:  Damn, he is tall    Junior in High School  Old enough to have a job but why should we give him a job that takes more brains than 'Would you like to biggie size that?' ?    Computer Trained and Learned  Wow, a nerd. Maybe he could work as the assistant burger flipper even!     Single  Yup, plenty of time to work as burger flipper, and confirms nerd.     Heard the 'But I want to still be friends' line once too many times  Ahh! So he has had a girlfriend before! Well damn, maybe not a full on nerd then!    Wouldn't mind a simple walk in the forest or minute alone to enjoy simplicity.  Where the hell did this guy come from?!     Borne in Walnut Creek, California. Lived 2 years in Concord, California. Moved to GP, Oregon at age 2 and living there until present date due to asthma  Holy crap.... Not only does he sound like a nerd but he has a damn disease too! And he lives in Oregon... That explains a lot too....       Well there is me on paper... and in the eyes of the reader... I think I'll do some more of those, they are kind of fun... and I get to make fun of things, mainly myself, but hell at least I get it said because, WAIT!, it is probably all true!
I miss your arms around me,   Even in the last of hugs. I miss your touch as we walked,   Hand in hand. I miss the lips,   Pressed along mine. I miss the way you looked,   The way you smiled. I knew it was a mistake,   And now I've lost a friend,     But lesson learned,   And yet I still miss.
Life sucks and then you die. Damn that is so wrong! If life sucked then at least there'd be some freaking pleasure!!! At the moment life is shit and then you die, that works better.... As you can tell, still not over my ex.. Won't be for some while ~if~ I ever do get over her, which I'm starting to doubt.  Let me go on about my 'day' though...  Late start this morning, so didn't have to get to school till 8:58, made it there about 20 minutes early to do Math homework, which I didn't do..[not sure it is hard to guess what my mind was on?]. Then at 9 am this morning the Test from hell was unleashed in Math class and I was told I had two periods to finish it, damn I hate math... [yet I signed up for not one, BUT two AP math classes for next year..]. On with the day though. I go through the test, nothing too hard really but a waste of trees and graphite from my pencil [mechanical of course].  Off to 3rd period at the bell, to Medieval History [yes, that is how it is spelled damn it, ME-DIE-VAL, which means Middle in Latin or something but yea]. Watched another part of 'A lion in Winter'. What a tear jerker...I listened to music instead.  Onward to Spanish!!! This was possibly the high part of the day. Other than the singing in Spanish it wasn't that bad because we danced the La Bomba, and the highest part was that I had two women, [girls if you must call them that], as partners, and I can say, wow, they are not bad looking and not the dumb blonde types which makes it so much better.  Well the damn bell rings, and even though it is 30 seconds late every period, and is not even a DAMN BELL [a tone is what it is]. Off to lunch, Felt like crap as I went too, had to w
