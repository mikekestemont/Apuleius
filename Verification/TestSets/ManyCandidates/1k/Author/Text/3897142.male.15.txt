Over the mountain take me across the sky Something in my vision, something deep inside Where did I wander, where do you think I wandered to I've seen life's magic astral plane I travel through I heard them tell me that this land of dreams was now I told them I had ridden shooting stars And said I'd show them how Over and over always tried to get away Living in a daydream only place I had to stay Fever of a breakout burning in me miles wide People around me talking to the walls inside I heard them tell me that this land of dreams was now I told them I had ridden shooting stars And said I'd show them how Don't need no astrology, it's inside of you and me You don't need a ticket to fly with me, I'm free Over and under in between the ups and downs Mind on a carpet magic ride goes round and round Over the mountain kissing silver inlaid clouds Watching my body disappear into the crowd
Oh no, oh no Here we go now Oh no, oh now Here we go now Got a crazy feeling I don't understand' Gotta get away from here Feelin' like I should have kept my feet on the ground Waitin' for the sun to appear Mamma's gonna worry I've been a bad, bad boy No use sayin' sorry It's something that I enjoy' Cause you can't see what my eyes see (I can see it, I can see it) And you can't be inside of me Flying high again I can see trough mountains, watch me disappear I can even touch the sky Swallowing colours of the sound I hear Am I just a crazy guy (you bet) Mamma's gonna worry I've been a bad, bad boy No use sayin' sorry It's something that I enjoy If you could be inside my head You'd see that black and white is read Flying high again Flying high again Flying high again Flying high again Come on and join me Flying high again Flying high againFlying high again Come on and join me Oh no, oh no Here we go now Oh no, oh now Here we go now Daddy thinks I'm lazy he don't understand  Never saw inside my head. People think I'm crazy but I'm in demand Never heard a thing I said Mamma's gonna worry I've been a bad, bad boy No use sayin' sorry It's something I enjoy Flying high again Flying high again Flying high again Flying high again
They couldn't see what I thought would be so obvious  They hide behind the laws they made for all of us  The ministry of truth that deals with pretense  The ministry of peace that sits on defense  I'm washing my hands of what they're trying to do  It's for me, it's for me, it's for you, it's for you  I'm just a rock 'n' roll rebelI'll tell you no lies  They say I worship the devil  They must be stupid or blind  I'm just a rock 'n' roll rebel  They live a life of fear and insecurity  And all you do is pay for their prosperity  The ministry of fear that won't let you live  The ministry of grace that doesn't forgive  Do what you will to try and make me conform  I'll make you wish that you had never been born  Cause I'm a rock 'n' roll rebel  I'll do what I please  Yes I'm a rock 'n' roll rebel  And I'm as free as the breeze  I'm just a rock 'n' roll rebel  They'll try playin' win your heart  They know it rules your head  If they could read between the lines  You know they'd see the real day  God only knows why they couldn't see the obvious  Is it because they manifest the incubus  The ministry of war that got caught in the draft  The ministry of joy that still hasn't laughed  When it's all boiled down and the day's at an end  I'll give you no bullshit and I'll never pretend  Cause I'm a rock 'n' roll rebel  I'll tell you no lies  They say I worship the devil  Why don't they open their eyes  I'm just a rock 'n' roll rebel  A rock 'n' roll rebel  I'm just a rock 'n' roll rebel

Yesterday has been and gone Tomorrow will I find the sun or will it rain Everybody's having fun except me I'm the lonely one I live in shameI say goodbye to romance Goodbye to friends, I tell youGoodbye to all the past I guess that we'll meet, we'll meet in the end I've been the king, I've been the clown Now broken wings can't hold me down I'm free again The jester with a broken crown It won't be me this time around to love in vain I say goodbye to romance Goodbye to friends, I tell you Goodbye to all the past I guess that we'll meet, we'll meet in the end And I feel the time is right although I know T
