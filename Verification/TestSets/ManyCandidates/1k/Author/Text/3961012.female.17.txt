I'm back..not like ive gone anywhere..just away from the comp..anyways..    i think i just managed to flunk physics..which is BAD..totally screwed up the essay part..let's just hope its not as bad as i think it is..and yes VIVA oral...so dead..my esl teacher said i was too soft..she played the tape and i couldn't hear my own voice...i thought i was loud enough..and to top it all off, i am currently living with utter guilt for not buying ah yee's present just yet..    u can say that i m actually currently quite  VERY S-T-R-E-S-S-E-D  . That explains why i have been suffering from this huge outbreak of   ZITS  .     Wednesday was Bio CT. At least someone decided to cut us some slack. Overall, the paper was quite alright..only with some really confusing objective questions..Someone should mention the incapability for a pig like me to analyse complicated and confusing "things" although i remember that I was once told that pigs are fairly intelligent organisms. Then again, I am only a pig-let..Perhaps my brain has not completely mature yet..Blek..im being so crappy    Let me continue about my wednesday. I came home at bout 5.30 and then rushed to piano class. I walked&nbsp;to piano class through&nbsp;the alley..so..on my way there..I saw a really tiny kitten..smaller than ur 15 cm ruler, hiding at a corner, purring so very loudly. It looked so &nbsp;  charm   (cantonese) (sorry ah..cant think of an english equilvalent for the word   charm  ) I was in a rush to piano class..so I had to leave it there..Then as I walked pass it, it purred even louder and it looked at me with those sad kitty cat eyes.. and when I reached a patch of grass at the end of the alley, I saw another kitten, most probably related due to its similar fur colour and size. But this one laid stiff on the grass and there was an open wound. A WAJA was parked next to it. I would think that it was the tyre that crushed the kitten and ended its innocent life. Don't get me wrong, I am not really for felines..just kittens..they look so irresistably cute and adorable..Don't u think? Cats on the other hand look more evil..My impression for&nbsp; felines &nbsp;has just&nbsp;changed from bad to worse&nbsp;after watching SHREK 2, two months ago, i think (the pirated version at yee's house). The puss in boots definitely proved that cats are just downright mischevious and evil.    anyway, enough said for now.    have to go offline..not like most ppl i know, i don't enjoy unlimited access to the net. Yes, i am still using dial-up.    Adios.     &nbsp;    &nbsp;
hi ppl..   its saturday..and im suppose to be enjoying myself..but no..too much work..but i think i had&nbsp; to come online to write this..dont want "my fans" to miss me too much..its been 4 days since i last blogged..so let's see what happened so far..   nothing much interesting..perhaps the most interesting thing was listening to ah yee talk to a guy opposite the aisle in the bus..about no other than anime..they just talked and talked and talked...then when i asked her what's his name (not that im interested in him or anything...dont get the wrong idea here..just that i thought he looked like a guy from my add math tuition class last yr)-she said i dont know..and apparently that was not the first time she talked to him..boy does she amaze me sometimes...   the seating in the bus was as such : Me--Yee...(aisle)...Guy--Michelle(my classmate)   like me, michelle knows nuts about anime..she sms-ed me "its interesting isn't it?"...not wanting to disturb their conversation....   not wanting to waste my credit when she was hardly a metre away, i looked at her and said "interesting..interesting indeed"...   Michelle found it rather hillarious..for them to talk so long and suddenly hui yee asked "eh, what's ur name?"..    &nbsp;  ok..enough said about stupid bus ride..   later that day...i went for swimming lesson....with kei...had lotsa fun there..instructor nearly killed us with laps and laps of practice...we wanted to sue him for child abuse..whether or not the police will actually accept our case&nbsp;as child abuse is &nbsp;a different matter...   enough said for today..need to go offline to do my math mini project..but before that..let me tell u some "things" i saw..   a notice on the door of a shop selling hair care products(i think),   "for delivery, pls call xxxxxxxx, to get attention" (what attention..i wish to find out)   the malay version was funnier..   "sila hubungi xxxxxxxx untuk receiving"    both of them make equally as lil sense..   my friend said.."lets call the number and say 'eh, i want to receive attention'.."   ...   and the following notice is a contribution of my "beloved" math teacher which i have adopted the name ah chong for him...   "do discussion with your group members for the mini project..If found copy no mark"   I appreciate his thriftiness in saving his marker pen ink to save the environment (indirectly i think it does)...but seriously..   the notice can make more sense with a lil addition of words like..if found plagiarising, no marks will be awarded...   blek...   and "do discussion"?   aih..   and to think he once asked me, "do you understand english" for saying "i dont understand u, sir"   pls..who can understand him with his superb english   that's all for now..wont be blogging&nbsp;at least for another four days..exams, ppl, EXAMS...
i know i owe bear 2 emails..i am&nbsp;just wondering how to reply. she's just so full of questions..and girl..i dont know what is there to complain when u got 90 something for EVERYTHING...     &nbsp;   as for me today...i managed to finish moral paper..just wondering if i would pass..but apparently everyone does..so i think i better pass..if not..er..  malu   le..    and i showed my lil dark side in class again today.. once again disturbed and irritated by the awful bunch of ppl in class who cannot keep their mouths shut for a nanosecond, i moved my table to the front of the class really err loud&nbsp;in a way..so i guess they sorta got the hint..their volumes diminished..but i felt sorta bad cos it l
