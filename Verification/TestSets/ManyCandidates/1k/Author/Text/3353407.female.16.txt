Well i got up this morning and went to school to take my chem final... i knew the best possible grade for me to make in the class was a C so i just did as good as i could... I ended up with a 77 on the final which makes the final grade a 77 for chem.  I just got home and my mom asked how it went... yeah i told her and she flipped out... but she can't say i didn't study because i've studied for the past two weeks.  Well its too late to do anything about it now... tomorrow i have my history final with hoyle and my spanish 3 final.  Im not too worried about history because i'd have to get a 98 to get an A and a 48 to get a B.  Theres no way i could get lower than a 48 so im not working on that as much as im thinking about spanish.  Its starting to hit me that school is ending tomorrow... in band its just wierd that david, nick, and brittney aren't there... and im not too excited to see all the little freshies move up either.  But i guess thats just how it goes, one class moves on with their lives while the next on is preparing to do the same.  I'm definitely going to be glad to be done with these finals though because im tired of the studying... but im going to miss seeing everyone every day.  Not to mention the fact that im leaving tomorrow night for my vacation.  My flight leaves at 7 to go to Orlando.  Me and the family are goin to Disney until the 28th and then we're going to the tween waters resort in Captiva.  Im glad that i get the chance to do stuff like this with my family but i hate that i have to leave the first day off.  Every single year we have to go on vacation at the earliest day possible.  I just wish i could bring everyone with me... but that kinda defeats the purpose of the family vacation.  Well other than that nothing else is goin on... just studying for those dumb exams... i think its a tradition for me to always say that next year is going to be different. Around this time every year i promise myself that im going to get all higher A's.  Im hopeing that my fear from not being accepted to FSU will help make that promise become a reality.  Speaking of grades i guess i've stalled long enough.. bring on the books.........
This morning i got up and got ready for church in about 30 mins (an all-time record for me).  Today's sermon was all about money and how we need to spend more of it for god instead of materialistic things... well if i had money then i'd probably be able to put it towards god, but i can't give what i don't have so i guess i'll just have to do what i can later.  We came home and it was raining so of course my dad said that i won't be driving in the rain... i'm hopeing that it stops raining and drys up a little so i can drive to church and meet stephen.  Now im just hanging out and getting ready for the week ahead of me.  I've got my oral part of my spanish 3 exam tomorrow, my chem exam on wednesday, and my history and written part of the spanish exam on thursday.  Then im leaving thursday night for our vaca to FL.  Well i'd write more but i better go study.  I forgot my history book at school so i have to go hurt someone down who has one.  I'll post again before bed.
i just made this blog... seein if its working... i'll post later
Today was a fairly decient day.  I got up early after spending the night at rhea's and went home cuz she had a denist appointment.  Then i went to the gym biked 12 miles... and wasn't too inspired to walk or run on the tred mills so i just went on to the muscle machines.  Then i came home and started to wash my car.  I was talking to my grandma and i missed Stephen's call by about 2 mins... so i called him back and he said that he was having fun but wanted to see me... yeah i know "awwwwwwwww" So then me and rhea met nick and joe at taco stank.  It was cool hanging out at good old taco bell again.  Then i came home and i've been sitting around doing nothing waiting to hear from stephen... he's going to call within the next hour so it will be good to hear from him.  Well im gonna try to stay awak that long... i shall return.
Saturday was a good yet bad day.  I got up and went to the gym.  It'd been waaay too long since i'd been.  I biked 10 miles, walked 2 miles, and did all my other muscle machines.  It felt pretty good to be in there again.  Then I came home and got cleaned up and stephen came over for a couple hours before i had to go babysit.  It was really nice seeing him.  Then i went to work and they got home around 11:30 which was around when stephen was suppose to be laoding the bus. So i went to his church to say goodbye.  It was good to see him go but i knew i'd miss him.  He told me that he'd call sunday when he got to daytona.  So sunday morning i woke up and sat around and did nothing.  It was nice... it was the first time this entire summer that i just got up and sat on the couch for a while.  I was expecting him to call me around 1 or 2 so you can only imagine how worried i was when i hadn't heard from him until close to f
