Skint Silly   I got suitably drenched this morning because I am broke. We are all broke. 'We' being my better half and I. 'Better' because he fixed me pancakes this morning, which is the reason why I can afford to skip lunch today as I am still full (OK, I lied. I am just broke).  I have $19 to my name, and he has $10 - but he doesn't know that. I’ve secretly placed one of my two $10 notes in his wallet last night. Good thing that we went to get groceries last weekend. That should last us for two weeks. But by then I should be home. Maybe. That also means that Mummy will go back to the Bug Woman Cave, hyeh hyeh hyeh. Hey, it isn’t that bad for them. They will have someone to cook for them all the time. They lead an easy life there as compared to me. All I get is sex on tap, The Family Guy, loads of Dutch cheese (I so like) and our occasional treat - Hello Panda chocolate biscuits. There is one packet left in the fridge, do you think he will know it was me?  So, it is all good except that I am broke. It’s not funny! Pass me $20, Someone. Yeah yeah... OK, fine. Be that way.  Also, all my friends are abandoning us now. Long story. Actually I also cannot be bothered with ‘friends’ like those.
So this party was better than the one that we had just left. It was the launch of a new magazine, set on the lawn of a charming old five star hotel. And this was no cheapo, low standard ‘do either. Chefs with their tall white hats stood behind their stations surrounding the guests, ready to whip out bacon risotto, crab meat temaki and deep fried golden cheeseballs. The bartenders poured us drinks from behind the ice bar by the water fountain. Our friends and some people that we know from the local theatre scene were there too so conversations were easy. I was chatting with my girlfriend and her partner, while my boyfriend wandered off to talk with other people.  Then Christian walked up to me and asked if I was enjoying the party. I said yes, and we clinked our martini glasses while we both looked around with smiles on our faces.   I have been drinking since I knocked off work, at that previous event. That place was half a minute’s walk away from my office so that had to be done. Five hours later, here I am, and I was getting a little tired and tipsy. I did contemplate about not going to work the next day, and then I decided against it. Oh well, I thought. I shouldn’t be over-indulging myself all the time. I must tell Jelte that we ought to go home.  “So where are you off to next?”, Christian prodded. I am known – and I am not proud about it – for going all out on parties no matter if they are on a weekday or a weekend.   But tonight has been a little bit strange for Jelte and I. Ever since he was ‘late’ in meeting me after work, which had kept other people waiting for me. Six months into being with each other, this evening had been a stage for a string of misunderstandings and miscommunications to happen. Although no one could be blamed for those verbal accidents, I was understandably upset. I can’t be blamed for unblamable mishaps.   “Actually, Christian, I am waiting for my Beacon of Light. We are going home”, I replied. “Where is he now?”. “Er, actually, I don’t knows I said. So we both looked around to locate my six-foot-two man.  And there we saw him, to our left, under a tree, clucking away pretending to be a chicken, as he chicken-walked towards a crowd of people whom I prayed to God were people he knows!  “Yep, that’s Jelte all right,” Christian helpfully informed me.   Bursting out in laughter, I remembered once again what made him so special to me. He is just so innocently clueless sometimes, and he does not care what other people think. And with that thought, I forgave him in my heart for his inability to be on time with me today (did I mention that I did not actually inform him of when to meet?), and I also chucked away all thoughts of pushing him into oncoming traffic on the way home.
There is a bunch of girls who work in the same industry as I am. We are all in the lifestyle, food and beverage, fun and games business. It is not all glam and handbags. We work hard. If you happen to catch us having fun, it is just us balancing the equation of working hard with equal amounts of partying.   All of us except for one are also dating full-grown men without what that is commonly known as ‘good’ or ‘stable’ jobs.   My partner doesn’t even have a job.   Or rather, he is in between jobs. Take my word for it – he tried, oh lord he did. But this is not about his inability to score an employment worthy of his talents and time.   Most women in eras as recent as 40 years ago can only dream about getting out there, going to school and earning a rightful living as well as a place in society.   They dare not even venture out in skin-tight outfits, go to clubs, meet members of the opposite sex, have drinks and smoke cigarettes.   I know, it can get tiring, bringing up the battle of the sexes issues, the past versus the present again. Especially since this is not the Adam and Eve Revisited.   But I do like to waffle on that the bunch of girls and I, we wear sexy clothes if we want. We go out there and drink like men, we smoke, we pay for our own stuff, we put ourselves in cabs, we go home and go to w
