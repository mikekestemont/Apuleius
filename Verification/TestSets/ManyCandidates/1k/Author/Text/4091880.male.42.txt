What is a Libertarian?? By now you've probably heard at least a little something about the Libertarian party. Libertarians have had a Presidential candidate on the ballot in all fifty states for the past three election cycles, and the Badnarik campaign is well on its way to making this year's election number four. We have candidates running for local and state level positions all across the country, and currently boast over 600 Libertarians in public office. Many people are even aware that the Libertarian party is the third-largest political party in American politics.   In spite of all this familiarity, the one question that many people still seem to have is, ``What exactly is a Libertarian??`` People with conservative beliefs often see us as ``liberal`` because of our outspoken defense of personal freedoms -- like the freedom of expression, or the freedom for peaceful adults to decide what to eat and drink, and how to raise their children. On the other hand, people with liberal beliefs tend to see us as ``conservative`` because of our staunch defense of economic freedoms, including the freedom for people to trade with one another in a way that they decide is in their own best interest. These misconceptions say more about the prejudices of the people who hold them, than they do about the Libertarian perspective.  Despite all the confusion, the Libertarian philosophy is especially easy to understand. Libertarians are, quite simply, people who believe in ``Self-Ownership``: I own myself, and nobody else on Earth has a higher claim to my body or my labor than I do. Likewise, we have a deep respect for other peoples` self-ownership: You own your body, and so long as you're acting in a way that doesn't interfere with anyone else's freedom, you should be free to do what you please.   The idea of ``Self-Ownership`` is what is what distinguishes us from both liberals and conservatives. Every political position that Libertarians take can be traced back to this simple idea. For example, Libertarians are opposed to ``liberal`` attempts to use the government to regulate people`s buying practices by imposing tariffs on certain goods and industries. We oppose this kind of regulation not because we think that all goods and industries are equally wonderful, but because we believe that people own themselves, and can decide what to buy based on their own beliefs and values. If for some people that means buying fair-trade coffee at the local co-op grocery store, then that's great -- just as long as they don`t use the government`s power to force other people to do the same.   Likewise, Libertarians are opposed to ``conservative``attempts to use the government to regulate people's morality, by imposing laws that restrict their behavior on the Sabbath, or at the pharmacy, or in the bedroom. We're opposed to these kinds of legal restrictions not because we think that all lifestyle choices are equally worth pursuing, but because we believe that people own themselves, and can decide how to live their lives as they see fit.  If you're not conservative and you are not liberal, where do you fit on the political spectrum?   The traditional left-right spectrum is one that political scholars have recognized as incomplete for some time. In fact, it is really only useful for tracking the answer to one question: ``What part of your life do you think government should control?`` On the left-hand side of the spectrum we find people who believe that it is the government's job to regulate our economic lives ; that is, our interactions with one another that involve exchange. Democrats and Green party members tend to be on this end of the spectrum. On the right-hand side, we find people who believe that it's the government's job to regulate our social lives. Republicans and Constitution party members tend to be on this end of the spectrum. This one-dimensional view of politics as something for controlling one area of life or another, explains why many libertarians cringe when we hear congress talk about passing ``bipartisan legislation''  The closest you can come to charting Libertarians on a one-dimensional left/right spectrum is to plot us directly in the middle of the two extremes. This is the only place on the line where you could put people who don`t believe in controlling each others lives either in an economic or a social sense. However, this fails to take into account that, like all other political groups, Libertarians come in varying degrees. It also makes it difficult to find a place to put people who believe that government should control both economic and social decisions.  It seems clear that the simple left/right political spectrum falls short of accurately describing the various mix of political opinions. There have been several ideas about how to address this problem, the most prominent resulting in the ``Nolan Chart``, which tracks personal and economic freedom along two separate axes. Libertarians often use a short quiz in order to show people where they might fit within this more accurate type of political spectrum. If you have not already done so, click here link to http://www.theadvocates.org/quiz.html and take the quiz for yourself. You may be surprised to see where you fit!   For those of you who score in the Libertarian range, you will find that you're in good company: From television celebrities Drew Carey and Bill Maher, to philosophers Murray Rothbard and Robert Nozick, to U.S. Congressman Ron Paul ; people from all walks of life are proud to call themselves libertarians.  Of course, ours is not the first generation to hold these ideas. The Declaration of Independence, presents what is perhaps the perfect example of the Libertarianism in this country`s history. The Libertarian concepts of self-ownership and mutual respect for each others rights were the ideas that sparked the abolition of slavery, and resonated clearly throughout the civil rights movement.   These are ideas that are just as relevant today as they were then. There are ideas that people still agree with in great numbers. However, too often people are lead to believe that they d
