urlLink Flicker Fashion    Blatant advertising for my friend's new fashion website.  I would only go so far as to call it "absolutely fabulous".  And that's just me.  She makes the clothes and she's an awesome C++ developer.  How much more talented can one person be?
urlLink IdealsWork: Compare the social and environmental records of thousands of companies    One of the things I like most about IdealsWork is that it's turned me on to an entirely new way of thinking about what to do with my shopping dollars.  Basically, I can decide, based on how I spend my money, what kinds of things are important to me in a customer.  It's interesting to think that your dollar has that kind of power.
urlLink MSN Women - Gals' Getaways    I need to remember this for the future.  I have some girlfriends coming over to bake cookies in a month or so and I'm considering throwing out the idea of a "girls only" trip somewhere.  I loved going on vacation recently with my husband, but I realized that there were definitely times on my vacation where a gal pal would have been great to have a long.  Don't get me wrong, I love Dale to death, but sometimes there's no replacement for the women in your life.
urlLink Whack-a-Pol - Slate helps you choose your presidential candidate    If you're anything like me, you've got no idea which presidential candidate you'll back.  Or, more honestly, you'd like to back Howard Dean, but you really aren't sure he stands for everything you do.  So, to help you out, Slate has Whack-a-Pol.  Answer a few questions, and they'll help you determine which candidate best meets your needs.
MSNBC -  urlLink 2 more judges block abortion law    I don't know about you, but I'm scared of our government and the power they have to control my choices.  I'm only scared of a few things, but one of them is President Bush.  He seems to be able to get by with things so underhandedly that no other president could.  I'm glad that there seems to be a fight at least in the courts to prevent the passage of the laws he is somehow managing to pass.  I'm not planning on having an abortion, but I at least like to know that the option is out there and available should I need it.
urlLink Spank Free Discipline  - MSN   A lot of people seem to think that spanking their kids is just wrong and makes them a horrible person.  I can't say that I agree.  I was raised that, if you did something wrong, there were repercussions, one of which was being spanked.  And I can only say that I think I'm a more well adjusted person because of it.  We were out somewhere and this kid was screaming his head off about something.  I remember asking my dad, "were we ever like that as kids."  And my dad said, "if you did it, you only did it once."  Enough said.
Action Item -  urlLink Kids Should Get Big Bird, Not Big Mac    When kids sit down to watch Sesame Street, they will now get a "corporate sponsorship message" from McDonald's. The message shows a flower blooming in a pot emblazoned with a McDonald's logo; happy children stand atop the earth with the famous golden arches below, promoting yet more brand recognition for the largest fast food chain in the world.   Sesame Street thus becomes yet another advertising vehicle for McDonald's, hooking a new generation of children on its high calorie, high fat, junk food -- junk food that has helped cause an epidemic of childhood obesity and soaring rates of type 2 diabetes, hypertension and other serious illnesses among children. Sesame Street is one of the most popular children's television programs on PBS. Parents expect the popular children's show to educate their children about letters, numbers and healthy lifestyles, not entice them to eat more empty calories. Click  urlLink here  to tell Gary E. Knell, CEO of Sesame Workshop, to stop running corporate sponsorship messages for McDonaldâ€™s before or after Sesame Street.
My first blog... should there be a book or something about that?   So this is my first blog.  Ever.  I saw this site on the website of an interview candidate.  Funny the things you learn from your interview candidates.  Yesterday, I learned that the latest twist on a "pimps and hos" party is "golfter pros and tennis hos".  If this Saturday's party goes well, I may have to have one of those.  I've been doing a lot of different things with my life lately, so I figured a blog would be a cool way to tell people things that I've found and that I've been up to.  So watch.  I may just through something in here that interests you!
First day, new revolution...   Okay, so I didn't do so well on the watching what I eat part.  Well, I watched it go in my mouth, but unfortunately, that doesn't make you thinner.  But I did do my make-up this morning and my hair!  And I took a lunch and went to eat at this new place in Charleston called  urlLink Firehouse .  I bought two t-shirts from there for Dale and I because I thought they were cool and I have this tradition of bringing Dale back a shirt from some place I ate when I travel.  Work is stressing me out a lot.  I told Dale yesterday that I'm feeling like I can't breathe or get my head above water.  I really need to relax a little more, take one day at a time, do what I can handle, and just let everything else go.  I think it's that I'm somewhat of a control freak with this stuff and I worry too much.  I need to change my ways with that, so that's my focus for tomorrow.
A New Year, A New Me - Hopefully   I've been reflecting on my life in the past few weeks and trying to figure out what I need.  So I've looked at a bunch of books and websites f
