And... 1 (one) guy on a motorcycle - Late 40s, white. Talking to both a 911 operator and his friend at the same time.  The guy was reassuring his friend and saying that he'd be okay. But it sounded like he was going to leave him before the cops got there so I decided to stay just to be sure the guy didn't bolt. And bolt he might have, because he was drunk and BECAUSE HE'D JUST RAN OVER HIS FRIEND. *Note to self- no drunken wheelies into your friends.  Anyway, I stuck around for awhile.
