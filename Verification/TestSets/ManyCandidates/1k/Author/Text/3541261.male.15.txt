Okay, I am in  major  nocturnal mode.  It's never a good sign when you go to bed when you normally wake up during the school year.  While sunrises are pretty neat when you stay up all night to see one, it's rather unfortunate when you sleep through both breakfast AND lunch.  On another topic different from my off the wall sleep patterns, I watched  Big Fish  for the first time.  While I had a lot of fun trying to analyze all the symbolism, I ended up totally befuddled by the end of the movie.  I mean, seriously, WTF?  Though, now that I've watched that, I have a sudden craving to watch  Alice in Wonderland .  Not the cheesy animated Disney Alice, but the awesome one with the White Knight and Turtle Soup; I remember watching it as a kid and being utterly amazed, but I can't find the video cassette we recorded it on.  I managed to find a copy of the summer reading assignment for World History in sophomore year at Hebron.  Holy crap.  If you think  The Once and Future King  by T.H. White is boring, Huston Smith's  The Illustrated World's Religions: A Guide to Our Wisdom Traditions  is downright brutal.  I can endure the Wart and Merlyn's Bunsen burners, but with my religious beliefs teetering between atheism and agnosticism I'd rather not spend my summer reading about how Grunthar formed the tiki-tiki tribe out of straw and mud in the South Pacific.

As many of you know, there was a torrential downpour that occurred today around 1:30 in the afternoon. Instead of waking up to the normal sound of buzzsaws (no workers today!), I woke up to the sound of water violently pounding on my bedroom window. I sort of turned over on my side, looking at the wall of water outside, thinking that it would surely be awful if someone was caught outside in that kind of rain.   Then I realized that the only thing keeping the water out of the media room and several other points of the house was a piece of plywood precariously duck-taped to the rim of the window frame. And I was the only one home.   Now normally I'd start panicking at this type of situation, but fortunately Gladys was present to do that for me while I investigated the damage. Fortunately the presumably very expensive hardwood floor was unscathed, but by the time I got there a closet was already taking on water. Overall report; no  major  damage, but we apparently have some basset hairs a couple fancy-like oriental rugs because  somebody  decided to adopt some new liberties while I was racing around for fresh towels to mop up the puddles.   ...  I also had a long-winded post about yet another Star Wars Galaxies experience.  But somehow along the way, half of it got deleted; I'll just let you all die of anticipation while I finish it up another time.
More workers came to the house today.  Now instead of waking up to buzz saws and Mexicans yelling for more supplies, I woke up to the smell of   noxious fumes  .  Apparently they started staining the crown molding in the media room.  Twelve hours later I'm   still   nauseous.  Today I realized that it's perfectly good to be as short as I am.  It's good to be short.  I don't have to put up with all the pressures that you feel when you're tall, like worrying if people will be attracted to you or if you'll ever play professional basketball.  Besides, being short is cool; you know, all that cool air sinks down to the ground. And stuff.  Every day for the past few months I've taken a capsule of this anti-acne medication.  It's designed to destroy the slightest chance of a minor blemish on my absolutely perfect skin.  Well, I took a look at the side label on the bottle of pills.        You should avoid prolonged or excessive exposure to direct and/or artificial sunlight while taking this medicine.    ...  Score!
Yet again, I haven't been keeping up with my projected "daily" posts.  You can thank reconstruction for the duration of last week's posts, and partially for the weekend's.  You see, I was forced to evacuate my original work station and move my computer to my brother's old room.  I can't concentrate to make a post amidst the buzz saws and incomprehensible cries for  un poco mas   of what I'm pretty sure was wood (apparently I won't be going a long way in this world with only Second year Spanish).    As a minor note, learn from the mistakes of the Hispanic trim-carpenters that worked on the crown molding in the media room; before you start singing old Beach Boys tunes Karaoke-style in the midst of your work, make sure that the owners of the house had officially exited the building, and that there isn't a rather confused fifteen-year-old student barricaded in the library downstairs, trying to read Once and Future King.  And if you  do  feel the sudden urge to do so,  please  sing in a key that doesn't make the resident basset hound start baying outside.  The nights had been preoccupied with my rediscovery of a new favorite game,  Tropico , which basically simulates the stereotypes of a Caribbean island dictatorship.  After a week of experimentation, I've found that it's nearly impossible for me to complete a game without the Communists and Militarists loving me and the Religious Zealots and Environmentalists hating me.  Fortunately, popularity doesn't matter anything to me as long as the citizens don't figure out that El Presidente's private Swiss bank account somehow quadruples amount of the dwindling National Treasury...  I was seriously considering posting at the beginning of this weekend (honestly!).  But unfortunately, some poor planning severely backfired on me.  My computer, currently the center of my existence in this world and my   only   link to the outside, had been placed i
