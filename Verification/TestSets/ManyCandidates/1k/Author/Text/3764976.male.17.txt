I just got up an hour ago and you know what...I...feel...GREAT! I slept longer than 9 hours for the first time in a while. Wanna hear something cool? Pembroke Academy is known overall to have poor sportsmanship in the athletics area. Well, I recieved a letter from the Don of the team, Mr. Doherty, with some good news. We had been awarded the Class L Sportsmanship Award for the 2004 season! Hey, we're the only team that actually won something! You all suck now because of this. There is a new movie coming out called "sleep over" or something like that. In the background near the end of the TV promo you hear a song with the line "Break out today!" Well, for those of you who don't know who it is, it's a band by the name of Allister and the song is called Stuck. This movie has ruined their careers not only because the song is in it, but they are in the movie as well...this sucks ass. I still love them though. Too bad the teeny boppers won't know that they are raging alcoholics who love to play stupid games when drunk. Oh yeah, summer sucks so far and it can fall off a cliff of blah right about now. Later.   Music Playing Currently: Avenged Sevenfold-Unholy Confessions
Yes, I have conformed as I was bored and it was 4:30 in the morning. Being bored is pretty shitty, but I can entertain myself. Speaking of entertainment, listening to my sister and my mother bitch is hilarious! They just don't quit until one of them gets their feelings hurt or my dad tells them to shit the hell up. Big ups to dad! My dad is pretty cool shit. You should all meet him some time. Definately the coolest dad around. Jon and I are starting a new band with a kid named Dan from Concord. Jon and I already have like 6 songs ready to work on so it's going alright so far. Saw Fahrenheit 9/11 on Friday night. Definately a must see for all those who want to know some cool facts. Yeah...so...Wimbledon is going on this week, which rules all. Go Andy Roddick and go USA! Take the title from the stupid Europeans. For those of you who know who I like...somehow I still like her so I'm just truckin' along here. Maybe someday I'll grow the courage to ask her out. Who knows, right? I guess that's it for right now. It's official, my cherry has been popped, blog style!   Music Playing Currently: Senses Fail-Buried A Lie
Got to play some good ol' fashioned Putt-Putt at Legends yesterday. It's no Tee Off At Mel's, but until I get a group of 4 along, it just doesn't seem like it's worth the gas money. I have calmed down a lot since I lost my deal and I looked at it from both sides and I would've kicked my ass from the deal too! Me and Janelle had a good match, but in the end I was defeated, 56-50. I was upset. Then we went down to the batting cages and met up with Josh and some other kid. I was kinda upset after getting done because I figured I'd get the baseball out of me and I'd suck. Quite the opposite. I was killing some balls in the medium and got a couple of hits in the fast. Now I just miss it even more and am considering dropping even more weight and building up my muscle again just to play. Anyway, after that we went to Subway and got some food, and from there it was up to Borders. I got two Cd's; Bad Religion's "The Empire Strikes First", and Cave In's "Antenna". I've been waiting to get a Cave In CD ever since Kyle told me about his brother's band a couple years ago. I will now do what Kyle did for me and tell you all about two bands that are very good. I want everyone to LEGALLY listen to Matchbook Romance and Hellogoodbye. You can hear MR on-demand right now as their video for Promise in on it. Hellogoodbye you can get from drivethrurecords.com as they are currently giving away their entire EP for free! They have some great songs on it. I think the songs Shimmy Shimmy Quarter Turn and Call N Return are great ones to just have fun to.  I woke up at like 5 this morning and this means it will be a long day. I guess I should've expected to wake up early if I sleep from 5 to 8, get up for dinner, and go back to sleep at 9.  I was just exhausted because I am messing up my sleep patterns bad by not sleeping some nights and just going all out for the next day. I just noticed something random; in the entire day yesterday and from Concord to Hooksett I did NOT see a single hot girl that I checked out! That has got to be some sort of record. That or my standards are way too high. Either way, that's really odd. Another random comment, today is Drive-Thru Records last day on a distribution deal with Geffen Records, meaning no one can steal artists away from them, like Geffen stole New Found Glory, The Starting Line(more than likely), Something Corporate, and had taken Senses Fail before deciding to release them to Vagrant. Those Geffen people really know how to do business......or not.
I noticed that the only time I tend to write something on this thing is when I need to bitch about something, but you know what? No one will listen to me normally so I figure that no one will read this anyway. Thus I will continue to rant on. A little over a year ago, I had gotten a development deal from a percussion company that will remain nameless, as I have no ill feelings towards them. At the time, Days Unknown was gaining ground fast. We were writing songs each practice a
