My sites went dead yesterday after nearly 4 years of mostly free hosting by my friend Dan in Michigan.  Lifeseller.com and Soupyet.com are cut off from the rest of the world.  They are penned up in the dark electronic cage of a server called helen in Charlotte, Michigan.  Dan said he was going to try to get a new connection, but it will probably be something slower than the one we previously had.  So, here I am.  Relegated to emptying my mind and thoughts on a free blog site.  This is so humiliating.  It's like a guy who has worked as a high-tech consultant for years and then the gig ends and he has to work bussing dishes at TGIFridays.  That's all for now.  I've got tables to clear.
I read  urlLink Senator Orrin Hatch's statement regarding the inducement of children to commit crimes through P2P networks  and found it disturbing.  Let's apply Sen. Hatch's "logic" to another industry, automotive.  Any company that builds a car which can travel faster than 75 mph and markets it in the USA may be violating the law.  Certainly if that company shows commercials of these vehicles traveling at higher than legal speeds, they are "inducing" me to copy that behavior.    Of course the advertisement will contain a disclaimer about how you shouldn't copy this type of driving.  But Kazaa also carries a disclaimer that says you shouldn't do anything illegal with their software.  The really ludicrous part of Hatch's argument is that he is the one exploiting the children for his own political purposes.  If his argument was sound he wouldn't have to resort to the age old tactic--the same one Miletus used in accusing Socrates--of corrupting our children.  Don't dismiss Sen. Orrin "Miletus" Hatch outright.  Remember, Socrates lost his trial.
I've been dreaming of fishing for quite a while now.  I'm sure these are deep symbolic dreams, because they recur so often and seem to have some vivid themes.  Last night I dreamed that I was fishing, first, in a deep clear pool or lake.  I could see the fish I was trying to catch.  In my mind I kept refering to it as a long-nosed gar, which is odd because that fish lives in the muddy Mississippi river, not clear deep lakes.  The other thing that was odd was that the fish I could see, although it did have the long snout you would expect, was a pearly white and had a blow-hole like a dolphin.  I was fishing for it with a white plastic jig.  I saw the fish take my lure but when I tried to set the hook, it came flying up out of the water.  The tail of the jig was chewed off and what remained seemed dirty.  Next, I was fishing in a muddy pond.  I had an enormous lure on my line with a single hook.  As soon as I cast it out, I had a strike.  I set the hook and battled the fish ashore.  I knew it was a big fish by the way my pole bent over.  When I finally got the fish out of the water it was covered in weeds.  I pulled the weeds off and revealed the biggest goldfish I wave ever seen.  It was a redish-gold color and was hooked quite soundly on the single hook.  What stands out most to me is the incongruity of the fish in this dream.  They are too big, the wrong color, in the wrong places, they take the wrong bait.  Any thoughts on an interpretaion?  Fishing seems like an obvious motif.  I'm looking for something in my life.  But why all the odd fish in odd places?  Am I looking in the wrong places?

I tried to email a blog message from my cell phone  today while I was riding on the bus, but I got the address wrong, so this is my  second attempt to blog remotely.&nbsp; Don't be as impressed with this message  however (if it works).&nbsp; I am typing this from home on my PC.&nbsp; I did  update the address on my phone, however, so I may try it again tomorrow from  some remote location.
I live on the east bank of the Mississippi River in Minneapolis.  I work in downtown Minneapolis, so most days I just walk to work.  It takes about 20 minutes.  Sometimes I see some interesting things during my walk to or from work each day.  This morning I saw the following:  A condom, still in the package A bright red pair of womens thong underpants 3 bottles of tanning lotions/oils A carving knife with the blade broken off halfway down
Edward M. Kerry, younger brother of Democratic presidential nominee, John F. Kerry was questioned this morning after reporting that he had driven his car off the Chappaquiddick Island bridge the previous night.    The body of Mary Jo Karpinski was found in the back seat of the vehicle by divers called to the scene.  Although in Massachusetts, a manslaughter charge is always given when someone leaves the scene of a deadly accident, John F. Kerry said that there is precedence for notable public figures and their families to receive little or no punishment in cases like this.  "I attempted to open the door and window of the car but I have no recollection of how I got out of the car. I came to the surface and repeatedly dove down to see if the passenger was still in it. I was unsuccessful in the attempt. I was exhausted and in a state of shock and I recall that I was able to get back to some friends who had a car parked in front of the cottage. I asked someone to bring me back to Edgartown. I remember walking around for a period of time and w
