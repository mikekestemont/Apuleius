oh hell yeah, it's finally friday!!! i'm gonna get my groove on w/ friends...oh yeah baby, i'm gonna raise some hell tonight...u who do not call are not welcome...hehehe...u know who u r...
it's almost the weekend!!! i can't wait, it'll be good!!!
wow, fun day!!!
there is so much that i am guilty of.  i am hypocritical when it comes to my believes verses my action, i have a hard time getting close to people, i am a perfectionist to the point of being neurotic, and i may be slightly obsessive compulsive.  but there's also alot that i am that's good.  i am open minded, i truely care about my friends, i really want to make a difference in a good way.  it would be nice to be judged by my sins rather than other people's, for a change.  but i guess that's another fault of mine, i always expect the best of others.  that's okay.  'cause those who stay my friends for a long time are those that are 'real'.  they say what they mean for better or worse, they are willing to be there through the good and the bad.  those are the only people that i want around.  i have some really good friends right now, and to all them i say 'thank you'.  u make each day a little easier.  luv u all lots...
OMG, what have i done.  y would i tell someone things like that?  i feel as if i'm standing naked before the world, exposed and vulnerable.  i hope i've done the right thing.   what's the worst that can happen?  right now i have so little to lose.....only time will tell. but prolly alot of time since i'm too chicken shit to answer my phone!  yeah i am the big of a loser!!!
oh yeah, it's only tuesday and already i can't wait for the weekend.  it's been too long since i've really let it all hang out.  could it be?  i think so.  i'm getting my groove back.  u didn't think that funk would last forever did u?  never!!!!!!!!!!
hahahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!!!!!!
you ask me to love you, or at least to claim to love you but i know you love me not, unless foolishly       i ask for friendship, to feel you near - alas, all i have is an imaginary friend i don't know what you want for tomorrow or how you feel when you       lay your head down you can not tell me what makes me cry silent tears or what makes me      laugh endlessly...       it's sad, but you're not alone. so few have seen my heart, have seen my trueness. i can't let people in, because of the one's that are untrue! it is too frightening to risk my soul, only to cry alone at night...       you may as well walk away now, after all of those words with no meaning      behind them, i've mixed the morter for the wall that will hold you back.       once i cried tears for you in moments of frustration, i cursed your name and      your empty words.       now you will live in my memory more fully then you ever lived in my life! there you can hold my hand and hear my words, as my friend... there you shall stay, never again being allowed into my life...
oh yeah, it's gonna be a good day!!!  i'm gonna chill and relax and not worry 'bout nothing.  wanna play?  come on over...hehehe..
oh yeah, it's saturday night, i look good and i almost feel good.  so i'm gonna curl up and watch some movies w/friends who luv me...u heard me, i'm gonna watch some movies...really!!! i'm not going out drinking tonight and no nothings wrong.  i just want to spend an evening w/good friends..and oh yeah, i got a 6pack...hehehehe..come on, it's saturday, what did u expect...
i feel so much better now that i'm not dissapointed in myself, just in others.  it's much easier to deal w/others letting me down then w/me letting myself down.  i guess today is going pretty well considering everything.  now, if only....hehehe...never mind...
i hate being sick, i hate school, and i hate u......
last time i checked i wasn't some psychotic bitch from hell...but maybe i should be since that's how i'm gonna be treated anyways...though i'm realizing that i'll be judged by people pre-conceived notions of who i should be anyhow.  i guess there is no point in trying, i'm wrong no mater what
even blog is out to get me...anyways, fuck u...yup u heard me.  treat me like someone i'm not, that's just fine.  maybe if you'd shut up and listen to me ud here who i really am.  oh wait, is that me being selfish?  who cares...there's no point...
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....i'm so sick of screwing up...screwing up school..screwing up relationships...screwing up my own damn head...i can't go down this same road of self distruction anymore.  i know i keep saying that.  i keep saying that while i make the same mistakes over and over and over...  i don't mean to overlook that which means the most.  i don't mean to hurt others who have done nothing wrong but try to get close to me...then again, u look at some of the things that others do to me and it makes me wonder why i keep trying at all.  i think some people have a very loose definition of the word "friend".  to me a friend doesn't blow things way out of porportion and lie about what happened just to martyr themselves as a 'bigger person'.  that's what a 6th grader does.  friends don't say one thing and do the other.  they also don't use u for their amusement and leave u outside in the cold, crying by urself.  i wonder if i shouldn't give up on people as a whole and make it my goal to live a solitary life.  it would be hard at first, but at least the only one i could be hurt by would be myself.  and i can numb that w/ alcohol and other things.  k, that's all i got for now...lots of luv
