SOMEBODY  depache mode   I want somebody to share, Share the rest of my life, Share my innermost thousghts, Know my intimate details Someone who'll stand by my side, And give me support, And in return, She'll get my support...  She will listen to me, When I want to speak, About the world we live in, And life in general, Though my views may be wrong, They may even be perverted, She'll Hear me out and won't easily be converted, To my way of thinking In fact she'll often disagree, But at the end of it all, She will understand me... Ahhhh....  I want somebody who cares, For me passionately, With every thought and With every breath, Someone who'll help me see things, In a different light, All the things I detest, I will almost like,  I don't want to be tied, To anyone's strings, I'm carefully trying to steer clear of Those things, But when I'm asleep, I want somebody, Who will put their arms around me And kiss me tenderly... Though things like this, Make me sick, In a case like this, I'll get away with it... Ahhh.....
Ok, Some people may have differing opinions on this one. But what I have written is purely from my own view point and I probably need more feed back on this than I have comments for it. Well, let’s dwell on it a little longer….  Can a fully platonic relationship between a guy/man/male and a girl/woman/lady ever take place!!!??? There is a mighty fine line between romantically acquainted  friend and a truly close one. Well, I would guess some people would be able to tell apart the differences, regardless of sexual orientation. However, sometimes, this mighty thin red line is pretty confusing at times…isn’t it?  How many males out there can boast that your BESTEST of best friends in actually from the female species (assuming you are permanently straight…no offence to other sexually oriented beings…but it would be too tedious to include every single orientation…) and if there actually is just one guy, and you do not having to eventually end up with ur bestest of best friend, could u please raise your hand? Close friends, yes, we may have a few…but to what extend is the closeness??  For the guys, I guess, the way our brain functions is more straight forward and focused. Mainly, a yes means yes and a no means no. So in relationships, we don’t really operate in multi level syndrome. We may acknowledge close ties with the female species, and unless there is money involved (figure this out yourself…), to us, there is only these 3 categories… Friend (yes, purely nothing will develop beyond this point), potential partner and partner.  Predominantly, the females (without having gone through operations…) tend to be able to have more males surrounding them as their close friends (assuming the female specimen is of a reasonable physical appearance…regardless of the level of intelligence…). This is clear in many cases, and no doubt that they claim a close tie between the male parties involved, but to what extend this closeness is held out, does it differentiate, a romance developing and a truly close pal?  Beats me.   But I believe the female brain has the ability to operate in a multi-function mode (multi-tasking as well..). When a lady says yes, it may mean maybe, sure!, errmmm…ok, no, damn it! Not now!!, good, yay! or yes. And when she says no, it may mean, maybe, common!! U know what I want!!, errrmmm…ok, yes, let me think about it, just go away!!, forget it…, die u #$%*ing bastard!!, or no. Aren’t they wonderful...? Definitely can’t live without them.   But this also brings us to the point that their exquisite ability to think on multi levels mean they probably categorize men, in terms of relationships, into several or maybe more of the following categories (I may be wrong about the categories…but I am certain there is more than 3): Let’s start with …Friend type A, Friend type B, Friend type C, Friend type D, Friend type E (which explains why females have different breasts sizes as well….), jerks, bastards, Out of my sight, ummmm….i cannot see him….ummmm….i cannot see him…ummmmm….., potential partner type 1, potential partner type 2, potential partner type 3, potential partner type 4, potential partner type 5, potential partner type 6….and  TA DA!!! THE ONE.  Complex, yet divine. The female species is a marvel of creation.  So, why is it, some things (in which, I mean romance….), are so straight forward, yet so… indistinguishably complicated? We, complicate ourselves don’t we? Platonic relationship, Does it really exist??...to me, a more important question would be, Platonic relationship, does it matter?... But like I always say, let nature takes its course… What will be, will be. Sometimes, it ends the way we hope it would end, sometimes, it doesn’t. So, I’ll leave u all with this quote from Katherine Hepburn…   “Love has nothing to do with what you are expecting to get – Only with what you are expecting to give – which is everything.”
Everytime she goes away, its sad to say goodbye...but still, i think i'm in the mood to sing....though my brain is hitting the negative part of the graph over these 2 days....I shall attempt a dedication...This is to GC...ha ha...(she doesn't like the publicity though...so no names for now...):    "Why do birds suddenly appear  every time you are near  Just like me, they long to be Close to you         Why do stars fall down from the sky… every time you walk by?   Just like me, they long to be Close to you   On the day that you were born the angels got together        And decided to create a dream come true            So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold                                  and starlight in your eyes of blue……           That is why all the boys in town… follow you all around  Just like me, they long to be Close to you  aah -aah -close to you…"    song by Carpenters  but has just been sung by M
