I have mixed feelings on our war in Iraq.  Now that we know there was no connection between Hussein and bin Laden in regards to the 9/11 attacks, I am concerned with our reasons behind going over there.  I think I would have much preferred that we had simply gone after bin Laden and al Queda.  On the other hand, the improvements that have been made in Iraq since the war began cannot be ignored.    Some have used gruesome photos of Americans being decapitated in order to convince us that this war is necessary.  Well, I see it differently.  Such activity gives me more reason to believe that we should not be in this war.  Can it even be called a war when our enemy is too pitiful and too much of a coward to actually fight a fair battle?  Kidnapping an American soldier and threatening to behead him is not courageous and it is not by any means indicative of warfare.  It's exactly what it is:  kidnapping.    If our enemy won't come out and fight, it's not a war.  Period.  This will continue happening to our servicemen if the U.S. military is not soon brought out of the middle east.  Being a military brat I generally have the tendency to argue that when a man or woman joins the armed forces, they understand that they are signing their life away, figuratively and literally.    But let's face it, this isn't what they signed up for.  This isn't real battle.  These terrorists, cowards, have no honor and have no sense of what it means to be real men and fight for what they believe fair and square.  They will continue their disgusting acts because they are heartless and simply don't care.  At the same time, I can't say that we should bring our boys back.  They must finish what these foolish terrorists have started, and I trust they will.
So.  Britney's engaged to dancer guy Kevin who has one child and another one on the way by his ex-girlfriend.  This came as no surprise to me.  None of these things do anymore.  So if you were expecting some kind of major rant against her, think again.    Leave the girl alone.  I am sick of reading posts online by (teenaged) Britney fans playing mothers and fathers to her.  She is not a child and if she cared whether or not her fans approved, she'd ask your opinion.  But she didn't.  So leave it alone.  What irks me more is that this Kevin guy is being judged and because of his image, Britney is being treated like some little girl blinded by "love" who can't see that he's nothing but problematic.  Perhaps he is.  Why does it matter to you?  Oh wait, let me guess.  Because you  care  about Britney?  Give me a break.  If you cared about her you'd let her make her own decisions (and yes, even mistakes) free of ridicule.  I still don't see why any teenager thinks that he or she has any ground upon which to tell a grown adult how to lead her life.  It is utterly pathetic that Britney must be judged and criticized for her every move, choice and bad decision when people her age and  older  are out there doing the same damn things (or worse).       Yesterday my dad and I were watching FoxNews.  They showed Britney and Kevin on some beach with the paparazzi swarming around them incessantly in a scene that reminded me much of a group of angry bees attacking some poor defenseless individual.    I would  never  want to be Britney Spears.
Ok so, one article claims that the fabulous fivepiece will tour Europe this fall.  But this tour will be different from their last, in which they filled arenas.  On  this  tour the Boys will be doing 3,000 seater venues.  Interesting indeed.    At first I was hardly pleased with what was supposed to be exciting news, as the very same article revealed the title of the first single from their upcoming album.   Climbing the Walls , a tune by who else but Max Martin.  But let's get back on topic.   Oh no!  I thought.   How will I ever adjust to tiny venues?!  How will it ever be the same?  The melodrama played out in my mind like a bad soap opera.    From the article I got the impression that Johnny Wright, their new (kind of) manager (he managed them in the beginning of their career), is starting the Backstreet Boys all over again.  When they debuted as a group they weren't doing so well in the United States, so they headed on over to Europe where they were accepted instantaneously.  Funny thing, too.  Now all European fans think they have some kind of right to the Boys because they gained popularity there first.   Chuckle.   So here's what I think.  They're touring Europe to ignite the smothered Backstreet flame there, and doing so in small venues so as not to embarrass themselves if they don't fill arenas.  That's fine.  And smart.  If they do the same in the United States, I won't be heartbroken but I do wonder what it'll be like.  Hopefully it will be easier to get closer seats and perhaps better concert photos will be the result.  We'll see.  What I'm most interested in at this point is the music.   Beautiful Woman  has been proof enough that they are capable of giving their sound a fresh and edgier style that would undoubtedly do well on the charts given the right promotion.  And you know what?  I want edge, but I also want that classic Backstreet feel, which there's no doubt in my mind they will deliver beautifully.  Alright, if I'm being honest, they could record a song with lyrics consisting of names and numbers out of a phone book and it would be better than anything on top 40 radio right now.  It's Backstreet 2004 and I'm ready for their return.  Oh so ready.
Hey.  How ya doin'?  I'm starting this blog because...well, I'm not entirely sure.  Just seemed like the "
