I ended up doing part of the suggestions found on the  urlLink Crackbaby.com  article. The part I did was to make all my applications call Firefox instead of IE. So now, when I click on a hyperlink inside of an MSN chat window, the URL opens in Firefox instead of IE. The method is pretty simple. Here are the instructions for disabling IE.  Do a search through the registry for 'iexplore.exe' and 'url.dll'. Replacing  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT  instances of these two with the path to your alternative browser seems to do the trick. I now have all my other Microsoft apps that would normally call IE, now calling Firefox.  For instance, I have Mozilla Firefox as my alternate browser so I replace with the following:  open/command -> C:PROGRA~1MOZILL~1FIREFOX.EXE -url "%1" DefaultIcon -> C:PROGRA~1MOZILL~1FIREFOX.EXE,1   It seems to have worked for me. Give it a try. Don't forget to back up your registry before editing it. You might have to restore it if all goes badly.
urlLink Rockstar Games  video game  Manhunt  is in the news.  urlLink Some kid murdered another kid , and both the police and the killers' parents are blaming the game. This is retarded. First, the game had an M rating which is 17 and up in America, and 18 and up in Great Britan, where this murder happened. The murderer in question was 17 years old, which means either he got a friend to buy the game for him, or his parents bought it. Either way, the parents knew he was playing it. After the hearing, Stefan's father, Patrick, said the boys used to play "Manhunt", a game on PlayStation 2, in which players earned points for killing people.  So, right off the bat, we can blame the parents for allowing their child to play a game which he was not old enough to even buy, and which they knew was about killing for points.  One might also argue that video games don't cause violent behavior. This is evidenced by the  millions  of people of all ages playing violent video games and  not  murdering people. I personally play all the violent video games I can, and anyone who knows me would tell you that I am an extremely nice, non-violent person. Saying the video game caused this kid to be violent ignores tons of evidence that the video game doesn't actually make people violent. One might also argue that people with violent tendencies will gravitate toward these types of games. I bet this kid has a few more games that are also violent, he just happens to like this one the most.  If your child is playing video games that are violent, and he/she ends up killing someone; please people look somewhere besides the gaming industry. It's not their fault, no matter how much you want it to be.
Despite my girlfriends very cute protests, I went ahead and named this entry Winkie Pinkie ;)  She's been working in a pre-school for about 4 months now, and has run the gambit of childhood illnesses. Everything from the sniffles to full blown flu... and now PINK EYE! Ewwww! Anyway, I hope you enjoy the wonderful photo of her beautifully colored eyeball there. That's all she would allow me to post.
urlLink Crackbaby.com  has an excellent article up on how to remove IE from your system completely. I, for one have been wondering how to do this for some time now, and  urlLink Xeno  has cracked it. Yay! The article includes instructions on how to make your other apps call your alternate browser instead of IE, and how to use Windowsupdate without IE. It requires some knowledge of registry editing, but if you've ever looked at the registry before and know how to change entries, you shouldn't have a problem. I'm still at work, so I haven't actually tried this yet, but when I get home, I'm going to implement the changes and report back in an update to this post.  Oh yeah, I found this article posted in my favorite blog ever,  urlLink BoingBoing.net     Update:  I remembered that I still use IE as an FTP client, so I haven't removed it yet. If I decide to do it in the future, I'll update with another post.
urlLink    urlLink No title  for this page. It's a very large collection of some of the most depressing photography I've ever seen. Slow to load, it's got a ton of pics on it.  It's depressing to me because I know that these people are on this page because our national leadership duped us into commiting the worst atrocities since Nurnberg. Also because I know that had I not gotten out of the military when I did, I could have very well been there geting 'sploded.
No, not the sun, although that's what I always think of when I see the words Death Star.  urlLink Astrobio.net  has a neat story about one of Saturns moons.    urlLink   Soon after orbital insertion, Cassini returned its best look yet at the heavily cratered moon Mimas (398 kilometers, 247 miles across). The enormous crater at the top of this banner image, named Herschel, is about 130 kilometers (80 miles) wide and 10 kilometers (6 miles) deep. Deeper than the Grand Canyon, Herschel stretches across nearly a third of the tiny moon's diameter. The central mountain shown at the center of Hershel is the height of Mount Everest on Earth.  This impact probably came close to disintegrating the moon. Traces of fracture marks can be seen on the opposite side of Mimas, suggesting that the destruction nearly split the satellite into two pieces. Although the icy moon bears a striking resemblance to the fictional 1977 'Death Star' from the Star Wars film by George Lucas, this low-density satellite probably had a more likely past not as a weapon or space station, but instead as a victim of one catastrophic day in its ancient history. That day Mimas came closer to dying rather than committing any planet-scale homicide.
I'm going to be spending some time today and probably tomorrow too, learning all I can about CSS and s
