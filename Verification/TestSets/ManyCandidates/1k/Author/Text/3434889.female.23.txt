urlLink Im new to all of this  So today is another craploa day to the max times infinty. i am so mad at myself for not going back to work. its like some kind of paralysing fear comes over me and i cant face the idea of getting out of this house to go to work. its like i am afraid to leave the house - yet the money woes are creeping back again. damo is worrying about how we are going to pay our bills - i know i have some sick leave available - but not a lifetimes supply! how do other people get through this darkness ? i have done this before and always come out on top - but it just seems that each time i fall down that mountain again its a little bit harder to claw my way back up. its like i have this negative nagging going on in the back of my mind that wont let me do anything for myself. i walked out the house yesterday and started to cry - it got worse as i drove closer and closer to work. i hate knowing that something like this is happening to me and that i am not in control of anything. i need to get back to work though - its just the mornings are getting so hard. maybe i should do what nicole did last year and start working from 9-6 - i will ask rob today when he calls me - i will tell him the mornings are so hard and i need to  be able to come to work a bit later for a couple of weeks just while i get back in the swing of things. i dont think going part time is the answer. i think that will only create more problems and more time for me to sit around doing nothing wasting away. i need to get out of this house more! i need to join some kind of social club where i can meet people again - i have no-one except for my family, damo and louise and jai - and they are 4 hours away! i need some new people to have as friends - even if they are just people i see when im at this place. what should i do then ? well i was thinking netball would be a good idea - god i just got a bill for the shrink - $200 groan. it is so unreal the way that they charge for just sitting there - he didnt even help me! i got sent to him for no reason at all by my doctor and now he has the gall to ask me for $200. and i love the way that the date of the consult was over a month ago as in they have given you 'time' to pay - now they are demanding it. yet when you go to leave - they are like 'oh thats fine, its all taken care of' making you think you owe them nothing, like its all on medicaree. grrrr i hate this shit! why ME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
Well its official - I suck. I suck big time, in fact if I was a vacuum cleaner I could very well be one of those crazy dyson models that has super suction and the ability to remove stains embedded deeply within the pile. Or perhaps one of those delicate little fish that clean the algae off the side of peoples fish tanks - you know the ones, they had one in Finding Nemo - and he was French.  Now that I have managed to get myself completely sidetracked lets examine today's mess that is my life. Maybe we should start off with the niceties like who I am, what I stand for and all that crap - maybe I should just lodge a disclaimer. My name is Erin and I am 22 years of age. I would tell you my last name but I don't trust you to keep it secret! I live in the audaciously auspicious town of Adelaide, in South Australia. Adelaide is known under many a moniker, affectionately entitled the city of churches by all the old geezers that live in Burnside and the like, or perhaps the festival state by those crazy cats down in the east end that sip on lattes and macchiattos all day long, discussing the innateness of the city within which we live. My favorite title of course is not so well know across the country - but is an affectionate indicator of the type of town we live in. And that name is the serial killer capital of Australia. That's right. South Australia has had more GRUESOME murders than anyone else! And god That's something to strive for isn't it! anyway. My favorite football team is Port Power - not that I really watch a lot of footy these days, and my favorite colour is purple. I am engaged to the love of my life, his name is Damien and he is my soulmate. We have a small modest 2 bedroom home in Largs Bay - which is about 30 minutes from City Centre and by the beach. We have a dog - a rhodesian ridgeback x and her name is Karma. She is nearly 2 and is a crazy crazy girl.  The other stuff I'm sure you will find out along the way - if you are so inclined. Anyway so today was supposed to be my first day back after two weeks leave from the hell hole that is my place of employment. I work in debt collection for one of the major banks. Now as you are already guessing I'm sure, its not exactly like working in happy happy land all the time - in fact if it were anything at all like happy happy land there would be serious cause for alarm. No it is more like working in hell than having a job in one of those boostin j
