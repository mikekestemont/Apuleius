OK so work tonight sucked. Bo-ring. There wasn't anyone to talk to. But Lindsey and I went to the Metropolitan afterwards and got coffee, so that was fun. Not to mention I got to see her new puppy! Chloe is a labrador/pit bull mix and she's soooo cute!  In other news, saw 'Eddie' tonight. Sarah, have you looked up a picture of Luke Mably yet? Anyway, as usual, I was too shy/tongue-tied/much of a loser to say anything, so it was basically a walk-past with no eye contact thing. *sigh* Must learn how to flirt...  I just watched 'The Quick and the Dead' on TBS. Horrible movie, made worse by the fact that it had potential, but still entertaining. Russell Crowe is hot. That reminds me, I need to see 'Gladiator.' I've heard it's good, though historically inaccurate.  Mom's at work, so I know she'll be in a bad mood when she gets home. Oh, here she comes now! Dad and I both think she'll be putting in her two weeks' notice soon. Heh, heh, heh. What else was I going to say?  Oh! You wanted to know who barrydublin is? I really don't know. I found his blog while looking at random entries on the 'most recently published' list and thought it was hysterical. You can't understand a word he's saying, as it's all written in what I think is supposed to be Irish slang. But there are some interesting pictures.  Tiffany and Nicolee are camping tonight and tomorrow night at Kanopolis. I'm not, because Mom was being OVERPROTECTIVE as usual. She thinks I would have fallen into the lake. *rolls eyes*  Perhaps I'll wait till  after  I turn 18 to tell her about the cruise...   'Cause I'm broken   When I'm lonesome   And I don't feel right   When you're gone away  AWESOME SONG: "Broken" by Seether with Amy Lee
Almost done with 'Revisited!' 60 more pages to go! I think I'll read ten per day from now on, so I can go ahead and start Portrait of a Lady tonight after work. I think I will really enjoy that book.  Just watched MacGyver. He's still hot.  The tree-painting at BGS has been moved to tomorrow. This is actually better for me, since I don't have to work tomorrow (for once-- I swear I work way more than every other Sunday). I forgot to ask if Mrs. B has paint brushes and a drop cloth and everything, so I hope she does.  So, um...that's about it. Dunno why I wrote this, just bored I guess.
There is a gray cat on my lap as I type this. Cleo is so cute!!!  Mom and Dad are watching the very end of Cold Mountain. Twas a very good movie, but sad at the end. I went and got gas earlier, so I missed out on semi-naked Jude Law. What a shame! :(  Lindsey, I hope you are reading this! Work was OK tonight. Got to talk a lot, and there wasn't much stock to put out. Hopefully it'll all be gone tomorrow, and all I'll have to do is that one plan-o-gram, which shouldn't take long. Whee! More goof-off time!  The tree-painting at Buhler Grade has been moved to Sunday, which means I get to sleep in tomorrow. YES!! Which means I have no excuse not to finish BNW:Revisited tonight. Darn.  Which is why I am drinking Dr. Pepper at 10:00 PM. That is, what's left of it after it sprayed all over the kitchen. Including the walls and the floor. *sigh*  Well, hey, I accomplished my goal! I was happy all day long :D   Some people want it all,   But I don't want nothin' at all.   If I ain't got you, babe.   Some people want diamond rings,   and some just want everything.   But I don't want nothin',   If I ain't got you.  -Alicia Keys, the aptly named.
Just got back from The Strand. I now have blonde and red highlights in my hair! Woohoo! It looks good, except you can't really tell that there's red in it. But the blonde is nice. It's still long and curly, too. I've decided that longing for straight hair is a waste of time, since there's nothing I can do about it.   Sarah, you're right. Stephen Tyler is quite possibly the ugliest man in rock 'n' roll. Except for Marilyn Manson, but then he's not exactly a man anymore, is he?&nbsp; Sorry I was feeling sorry for myself last night, I get that way sometimes.   What picture of me do you have on your fridge? I hope it's not my school picture.   I read part of Brave New World: Revisited while my hair was drying in the salon. God, this is a dumb book. It's anti-everything. He raves and raves about the problems our society has but he never suggests a solution. Only eighty pages to go, then I can start on Portrait of a Lady.    I know I tend to get so insecure    It doesn't matter anymore     &nbsp;   It's not always rainbows and butterflies    It's compromise that moves us along    My heart is full and my door's always open    You can come anytime you want     &nbsp;   I don't mind spending everyday    Out on your corner in the pouring rain    Look for the girl with the broken smile    Ask her if she wants to stay awhile    And she will be loved    She will be loved    Notes:  This is "She Will be Loved" by Maroon5. It is a very good song, at least it was until they started playing it on the radio.    Today's Resolution:  Be Happy! :)
I don't know why I am writing this except I am bored. I am only talking to one person on MSN, and it's a real person (as opposed to someone I don't really know), so it's not nearly as interesting. For one thing, I cannot have deeply educational conversations about the differences between the public school systems of the US and those of the Netherlands.   Thank you, Ilke!  Anyway, I thought I would come on here and write a nice rant about w
