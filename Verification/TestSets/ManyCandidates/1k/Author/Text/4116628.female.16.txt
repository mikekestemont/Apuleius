It's been a crazy week. Mainly because I found a job hehe :) I am now an ice cream scooper, woo hoo! yep I work for Ben and Jerry's pretty cool eh?  I would write more about it but I'm feeling lazy today. Maybe I'll get to it later.
Listening To: raindrops and cars passing by.      I did .96 miles today on the treadmill. Not too proud of myself but my side was really starting to hurt so I had to stop at 17.42 minutes. After the pain subsided I got on the eliptical machine and I did 1.32 miles of that in 20 minutes.       Wow... it's really pouring out there. I always liked the rain though. Especially the kind when it's not too cold out and it's down pouring. I loved getting caught in the rain. I remember once... it was on my friend Renata's birthday we were walking from school and it was raining so hard... I had the bright idea to go and walk to her sister Sabrina's school and pick her up. Renata agreed and we walked in the DRENCHING rain and when we noticed that her sister wasn't gonna come out we decided to just go back to her house. There we saw Sabrina in the kitchen eating cereal. I think Renata was ready to kill me then. But it was all good because it was fun none-the-less.       I went to the bowling alley today to return a job application. I really want to get this job. I like the environment and the lady that I talked to was really nice. I wish I had gotten her name but I didn't. I'm gonna see if I can call again tomorrow and ask about the job position. My brother and Julie brought me there before we went to the gym.       Well... that's all for now.
Listening to: "Angel" Sarah McGlouglin.... sorry don't know how to spell her last name.   "... and it's hard at the end of the day, I need some distraction"      I went to Cranston today and looked into a couple of jobs.    A place I'm really looking into getting is at the bowling Alley. The lady that talked to me was really nice and I wouldn't mind working with her.   She gave me some advice on how to get the job or my best chances are.   So yeah, I'm looking into that.      Um... gosh, I don't really have a lot to say tonight, other than... I finished "The HotZone" it's a really good book,  well... I think it's really good for a non-fiction, which, I'm not usually a great fan of.       Well... that's all.
Listening To: "I Still Believe"      Wonderful, just wonderful. The pressure of finding a job just got higher. My brother's fiance's boss asked her and a co-worker if they'd like to volunteer to be unemployed instead of waiting because the company's not doing so well. I'm so glad I have my friend Robert to support me with this whole thing. With school coming up, I don't even know if I can handle holding a job and keeping up with my school work. Well.. actually I hope I can, I mean, I have to. I'll just have to tackle it one day at a time. For now, I have to try and FIND a job. Robert's willing to accompany me on Wednesday on the job hunt. He suggested tomorrow but I told him I can't because tomorrow I have a dentist appointment. Well... I have to wake up before 6 tomorrow. So, I'll end this short.
Listening to: She Will Be Loved      "I don't mind standing every day... in your corner in the pouring rain, look for the girl with the broken smile, ask her if she wants to stay awhile, and she will... be loved."       I really love this song! :) hmm... today's the 8th of August... This is my friend Em's birthday... well... I still consider her my friend, but we've lost contact. It's funny though cause we both live in the same state, Rhode Island (the smallest state in the country at that) yet, we haven't talked or anything. I think times had been really hard on the both of us, cause we both had to do some moving. I wonder what she's up to. *shrugs* I bet I'll cross her path one day or she in mine.       What happened today... not much really. I spent every other hour reading the book "My Antonia" I'm on page 132 and there's 27oish pages. So yeah I have a ways to go. I'm planning on reading a lot more tonight and maybe finishing the book tomorrow because I want to stop by the library to get the book I have on hold. Um... no, this isn't all pleasure reading, I have to do it for school. I did do some pleasure reading this summer though. I read this book called "Demon In My View" good book, I liked it. I liked it so much I read it under 2 hours. Woo hoo for me! :)      Let's see... anything else? I talked to my mom. She's visiting some time near the end of the month so that's cool. School starting soon... like 23ish more days... I CAN'T WAIT! well... actually a part of me can't but another part is dreading it. *shrugs* New school... new people... It's funny because I'm not worried about the teachers, work, students... just... god I hope I find a good place to sit for lunch. Last year I did the mistake of sitting at an empty table and allowing a girl to sit across from me. *shakes off building frustrations from remembering the past* to make the long story short, that girl ended up being the girl noone liked and she stuck on to me like a leech. I'm not the type of person to push people away so I never told her to bug off! I've learned my lesson though. I'm not being mean I swear! She was annoying!!! Always wanting sympathy or people feeling sorry for her, she a
