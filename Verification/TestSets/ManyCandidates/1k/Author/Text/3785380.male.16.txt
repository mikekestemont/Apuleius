man....i had nothing to do today. no one to hang with, no where to go, just a plain boring day all by myself.  o well....ill live. anyways this is my very first post, yay for me...lol.   the poem i wrote a while ago...   when you walk away, you dont hear me say please, o baby dont go. simple and clean is the way that you make me feel tonight, its hard to let go.  the daily things, that keep us busy. are confusing me, thats when you came to me, and said. wish i could prove i love you, but does that mean i have to walk, on water. when we are older you'll understand its enough when i say, so and maybe some things are that simple.  hold me, whatever lies beyond this morning, will be forgoten later on. regardless the warnings the future doesnt scare me at all, nothing is like before.  when you walk away, you dont hear me say please, o baby, dont go. simple and clean is the way that you make me feel tonight, its hard to let go  o ya....lol
yesterday... called dj over and hung out for a while...ya great fun...then called colin up to go to the pool to play tennis and then to go swimming. we kept throwing the ball out of the pool and had nikhita go and get it for us everytime...lol. then me and dj left the pool to go to the movies with malorie and breanna..we watched dodgeball(great movie)...ya. after that we went back to malories house to hang for a while...then later we started to play demon...i won of course..lol. about and hour later we came back here to my house to eat and mess around...great fun also. then we all went to the fire work stand up the hill to go and buy fireworks...it started to get late so we started back home...then half way home, malorie, colin and i ditched dj and breanna and went down the trail to cut them off...lol but that didnt work out too well..we ended up way behind them and had to run to catch up with them. then when we got back to my house we hung out and talked for a little while longer and then malories mom came to pick them up and so they left...then after that, me dj and colin played poker with my dad for money(colin ended up winning)...then when we were done we got up and went outside to go sleep in the tent...went to sleep real fast...i stayed up to think about things...ya then today we got up, ate breakfast and played poker again...this time me and dj tied so we split the pot and we both won $10...o well that was my day...
