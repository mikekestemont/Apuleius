seminar was ok....lots of common sense, but it's good to be told/reminded stuff. there are some worksheets and stuff that i think will be useful. open house was "a success," according to Don. Wonder if it still will look like a success when they see all of hte g&a hours put into it.
Tonight I'm going to a seminar, "Smart Women Finish Rich." It should be insightful. I wonder if i can still finish rich when I don't make enough to save?
so here i am today, at work with not a whole lot to do. i'm back and forth with the graphic designer assigned to my project, but in between i'm not doing much. it IS 4 though, so i'll be outta here by 5, hopefully. we'll see.
on tuesday i was driving down our street to go get sandwiches and beer, and I passed a house with a huge dumpster out front, as well as some furniture. it looked very 50-60s, minty fresh era, so I stopped to look closer on teh way home. lo and behold, there are 6 chairs! 2 cool dining-room types, 4 metal-frame, orangepatterned vinyl ones. I drove home, convinced james to jump in the jeep, and we rescued them. will include pics soon. now i have to figure out how to make covers; it looks so easy on TS when hildi and laurie do it; I ran into corner-type problems when basting last night. another half-done project, and we have houseguests coming.
i hate when other people's poor performance at a job impacts my ability to get things done. ESPECIALLY when they are in a high-up position, and they are so incompetent.
i am CSS-challenged. sad.

want to change template, but only know enough to change colors. sigh.
Today I am making an effort to be happy. I look nice, I feel good. When I got to work, I realized that there are a ton of bills that are unpaid (that's why I feel like I have too much money in my account....) Now I don't feel as good. :( I will shrug it off...I will. ok, off to work now.
yesterday i found out where my brother is. A city of about 443, 500 people south of Baghdad. He said they were "guarding" the city. as soon as i got to work i looked up where that city is, and any news about it. seems like there's nothing huge going on htere---not that thousands of "liberated' Iraquis looting the city isn't huge. I wonder if he has been in a doctor role at all, or what. james says he can't wait to pick rob's brain and ask him about what he's seen there, how he feels about it, etc. i don't know if i feel comfortable asking about that. it seems like an intensely personal thing.   i looked up guidelines for sending stuff to soldiers, and printed out 19 pages. too bad i forgot the address, b/c i could have saved about 16 or 17 pages by just looking up hte zip-ish code and seeing what restrictions apply. I also printed out a stack of name change documents, and plan on hitting hte SS office and DMV (or MVA in MD, will never get used to that) on thursday afternoon. it's james' birthday, and it was a ruse to get out of work early and thus get home early, but i hope it doesn't backfire.
was back. hit post at top. it appears. yay! i think i figured it out!
gone.
ok, where did the orange Publish button go?
testing...why can't i figure this out?
This is the inaugural entry into my new blog. I feel the need to have an outlet space where I can bounce ideas around and track my mood.
more fun with new templates
today is supposed to be 80 degrees and sunny. a respite from the rain. i am full of beauty products today. i can understand the female obsession with beauty products. They make you feel good, pretty. Why do men not get this feeling? Products I am currently using: zest soap herbal essences body wash nivea shaving cream fructis shampoo and conditioner dr. feelgood bathina body so fine michael kors leg shimmer dry idea unscented deodorant l'oreal coverstick corn silk powder garden botanica shimmer eyeshadow clinique naturally glossy mascara cynthia rowley lipliner and gloss  Whew!
oh, by the way, no architecture school. not at 24-25 anyway. should have listened in HS when someone said that would be a good path for me. now it's too late. teaching, not too late. will continue to think of that.
so, the idea to do the parents' albums in mypublisher is again on hte table. i think it will be the best idea--most pics included, etc. since my new work computer doesn't freeze when i go to the site, i was able to upload a bunch of pictures. cool. will do more when i'm at home. james has band practice tonight, so I'll have the house to myself. need to finish scanning color proofs and re-scan selected b&w for it.
architecture school?
i just figured out that i made more per hour painting for my dad or mowing lawns (when I was a teenager) than what I take home per hour from here. granted, that was cash and tax-free, and this is after taxes, but still... last pay period i worked 88 hours and got $10.58 take home per hour. pathetic. and i have an advanced degree.
are people who devote tons of time and great writing to their blogs better than me, or have too much time on their hands, or live life through blog, or just differently prioritized?  I guess if anyone else could see this, I'd be trying to write more/better.
the weekend flew by way too fast. friday night was fun; seeing the "band" was great, and James had a good time. saturday was a totally wasted day, however. we had brunch w/mark and his fam, but then went home and did nothing. i slept from about 3:30 till 10:30 without meaning to. went up for a nap b/c james was on couch and i w
