Mood:  mm, sorta Hungry  Listening To:  Nothing,....:/  mmm wow, its been a while, Friday went well, English Lit test was ok, though extremely long, but I planned everything out and I hope for the best. I seem to have chosen the questions nobody else did :/  Met Jo after, we went to Marks and Sparks, then McDonalds, god some food etc then just hung out for a few hours doing litterally nothing at Figgs Marsh. I have this thing about people coming to my house, mainly because I'm sorta ashamed of it, and well only 2 people since I've started Secondary School have came round and thta was Jo when we were going out and Claire when we watched Shawshank redemption. Well at least Mum want to redecorate, though shes leaving our room to last..  mmm, Saturday was boring as I didnt do anything, would like to have met up with Jayson, but he had plans, so I just played games etc. Sorta developed a crush on him, but he'd rather stay friends, which is fair enough.  mmmm, I gotta get up off my ass more.  I dont really have much more to say, catcha later!
Mood: Calm, Happy  Listening To: Laura - Scissor Sisters  Had a chat with Jo(Ursuline Variety) very nice girl, though people dislike her for being too kind, hmmm. Either way I'm not going to say anything bad because she helped put things into perspective. I need to branch out more, whilst relying on Aidan isnt too fruitful, although can be, and relying on Jo, whilst she can be excellent company, her sharing her time with Ben isnt leaving me too happy. Relying on any of the ventures for social activity is like speaking to a brick wall.  Lord knows WHERE I'll branch out to...  But I'll be wanting to get a job, probably in sutton as it's pretty damn close and I know my way around. I'll have to look around, maybe over the half term...mmm..  AH, English Lit test tomorrow, 2 hours 15 mins of unadultarated FUN FUN FUN[/sarcasm]  Bit of a short one today...maybe an update later, I'll leave you with a tip top from Jo,  " Just remember that you are the only one who can live your life and that you will only get out what you put in: put in good, the outcome is good "
Mood:  Blank  Listening To:  Midnight Sonata-Beethoven  Wow, Im feeling sooooo blank tonight, however seeing as I havent updated for a good while, my apologies...mainly because of tests, I'll tell ya whats been happening. ICT was pretty long and tiring, alot of detail. The FOUR module tests for science I took wore me out, the 50 minute wait inbetween the 3rd and the 4th pretty much drained all enthusiam, alas, lets hope I did well.  RE today wasnt so bad, easy questions on the stuff I'd revisied, but harded questions on stuff I hadnt revised but sorta knew, alas, sorta the test you'd expect really. I REALLY want to get an A* in this, Im sorta expected too...and I could.  umm, Jo's really into Ben at the moment, sorta annoying as She's dumped me (see Dean and Nelson) before, looks like I'll have to find something else to do, meh.  mmm, Im sorta in a weird mood at the moment, I dont really care about going out with anyone, but yet, I sorta would like someone..:/  blaaaaaaaaaaaah, Im sorta frustrated, gah I need some entertainment, but the gcses are boring me SO MUCH!  Well, thats enough from me, expect something from me tomorrow...  Saying that, Im about as reliable as a Tom Emerton(TM) Joke..
Mood: Calm   Listening To: Nothing, a bit late for it..   Ah, what a very mixed and weird day.  Not totally out of the ordinary though. I woke up, past midday and got myself a pint of tea (yeah, in a pint glass, Im wasnt feeling too hungry) Then went straight on the computer, something I must get out of the habit of doing, I end up wasting far too much time.  I went about starting some ICT Revision for my test on Monday, things looks good, though I need to settle some definate pieces, which I will try to do tomorrow. Speaking of which I plan to try and do as much science work as possible. Which reminds me of the RE I need to finish for Wednesday. Oh, the joy of revision.  Did some running today, times of 8.28 and 6.32-ish non-stop jogging which isnt too bad, I need to keep it up though, Also measured myself again and I seem to be losing some inches around the upperbody which isnt too bad, that or the fact i used string instead of the metal tape to measure may have something to do with it.  Really need to get some work done.  Ah, reminds me that my dad promised to get me a laptop if i got 6 A*'s.....Not sure If I can do it, I'll analyse some of what tests I'll be doing below...   Maths - Could  get an A*...A otherwise  Bio -Could get an A* for all of them....A for all though  Chem -A  Physics -A  Eng Lang -....Could get an A*...Maybe an A  Eng Lit -A Hopefully.  ICT -Depends on the coursework...shame theory is only 40%  RE -I could realistically get an A*  Hist -...It'd be good to get an A  French -mmmm Coursework :A, Oral prolly a B,...need to do well in the listening and reading  Classics -....Prolly a B...  I could get 6 A*'s...though im not sure if I could....talk about an Incentive...
