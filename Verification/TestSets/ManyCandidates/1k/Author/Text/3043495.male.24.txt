It's bed time, but I've been wanting to write a quick note about the mp3's I have posted. The hosting package I bought gives me 10 MB of space, so that comes out to maybe 10 minutes of music, a little more if I use a lower bit rate. The point being that I can't have a lot of songs up at any one time. I may find another place to host them, but for now I'll just but up a few of my better ones, and rotate them every once in a while. I was thinking it might be good to do on a monthly basis. So these are the songs for April. You've been warned: download them before I rotate new ones in for May.  "t.s.g.f.m. (That Sexy Girl from Mississippi)" is about a girl I met through the  urlLink Truman Scholarship . (As an aside, Willamette just had  urlLink two more students win . That makes 8 in 6 years. Go bearcats!) I wrote it during the Summer of 2001 while I was in Eagle River, Alaska living with my dad and working as a checker at Carrs (owned by Safeway). I only wrote two songs that summer (the other is "Going Away") but they're both among my best.  It's one of my most popular songs because it does a feminist critique of itself halfway through. It's sort of like a point of convergence between the major themes of my songs: love, politics, and humor. This is the first stereo multi-track recording I've done, which I did sometime in February. It has vocals and harmonica panned to one side and guitar panned to the other.  I wrote "Mostly I'm Just Lonely" while I was studying in Quito, Ecuador fall of 2000. I wrote 10 songs during my the 4 months I spent there, but I only sing 3-4 of them these days, so it all amounts to about the same thing as just writing a few good ones, I suppose. I read somewhere that Dar Williams only writes 6 songs a year and that made me feel better.  Many people think this is my best song. The guitar part is based on this fingering of the C to G chord change where you leave your pinkie and ring fingers down fingering the G  (3x0003) and have the index and middle finger press down to finger the two notes to turn it into a C with a G in the bass (3x02013), never sounding the 5th string because it's not part of either chord. This is used on "Last Thing on My Mind" (Tom Paxton), "Boots of Spanish Leather" (Bob Dylan), and "Kathy's Song" (Simon and Garfunkel).  This recording is from the "Will Play for Food" benefit I did at Willamette in February 2001. I printed up a menu of songs for people to choose from. They bid for the right to pick the next song (I played for 2 hours and raised $159). Thanks to  urlLink John Vollmer  for the recording.  That's more extensive that I'd originally intended, but maybe someday I'll be able to borrow from this for liner notes to a CD.  --Russ
Today I applied to work at Walgreens and Hollywood Video. This time around the plan is to apply for jobs around here for short-term work, while also applying for jobs I'd be interested in doing until I go to graduate school in a year or two. I was able to apply to both online--that's what they told me to do when I stopped by and asked if they're hiring.   This touches on something that's been bugging me lately: how much of my life centers around computers. It seems like nearly everything I want to do requires it. It's the place to look for jobs. It's the affordable way to record my music. I keep in touch with most of my friends via email since they're scattered across the globe. It's the place to go if I feel like writing anything. And I also manage to waste a bit of time playing addictive computer games from  urlLink Blizzard .   So yesterday I decided I'd have a TV free day and not turn the thing on. That was nice for a change. Sometimes I feel like my computer is a black hole that just sucks me in. I've been thinking about how we're moving towards doing more and more with computers--bills, banking, shopping where will it end? I wonder what that will mean for us. I know that my wrist problems are partially from doing computer stuff (as well as working as a grocery checker summer 2001 and playing guitar). It seems like cumulative trauma injuries are becoming more and more common each year. To some degree it's up to us. We can choose to talk on the phone (or write real letters, remember those?) instead of email or read a magazine instead of the web, but there are also many things we  have  to do on computers, like applying to work at Wallgreens and Hollywood Video.  Time to turn this thing off and read a book.  --Russ
One of my favorite folk singers, Stephan Smith, has a new song about Bush called  urlLink You Ain't A Cowboy . Click on that link to listen to it for free. If you like it you can buy it (download the mp3) for $.99 as part of an online fundraiser for  urlLink True Majority , a group started by Ben of Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream that works for progressive change in the U.S. You can download some free songs from his  urlLink website . I particularly recommend "The Bell" (with Pete Seeger), "The Darling Son" (opening for Ani Difranco), and "All Together Now" (from his debut on Rounder), but they're all very good.
Well, here it is, my new blog (weblog) on my new web site. I hope that this can be my sister Annie’s website, too. Actually, it’s open to all of the Bither-Terrys in the world, but as far as we know that amounts to just t
