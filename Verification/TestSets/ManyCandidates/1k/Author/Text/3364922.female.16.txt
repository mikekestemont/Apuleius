an oldie, but i still like.  A broken heart, divide in two Half of it i'll share with you Then you can experience what i went through The judgement and betrayal, just to get to you Splitting headaches, screams of pain As you hurt me, and drove me insane Now i have no heart to share with you It was destroyed in the ashes as i burnt you.  hmm. a reminder of my past, most likely my future.
please, allow me to inform you on my joyous horoscpe for this week. 'You are feeling a great desire to escape or withdraw into yourself. This can be a very depleting and confusing time when you do not know exactly what you want. You do not feel strong, capable or effective. Physically you need to be gentle with yourself and take care not to dissipate your energy reserves.  notice it says i'm born in the year of the rabbit in my profile? well. it's wrong. i was born in the year of the dragon, 1987 is actually the year of the rabbit. *sigh*
Run away from home No where else to go slashing up her wrists 'till they're just blood and bone And they say it's a beautiful world To see all these wonderful things.  It's now nine twenty-three and we still haven't heard not a sound not a whisper not a motor down the freeway. It's dark outside,  and cold What's a beautiful world?  Just give me my guitar and perhaps a tambourine or a book of lyrics. Lyrics of a dieing man who feels there is no time. Then let's see who's happy Now can you tell me, what's a beautiful world?  Face the day, awake the night Wear long sleeves to cover the wounds this is what a beautiful world can give. Look at the pretty colour on the edge of life.  Nine twenty-seven A last breath A shiver down the spine Drowned in murky waters Blood-edged knife Blood-edged life Now can you tell me, what's a beautiful world?
this is my life. boring useless and has absolutly no point to it. see? look. my life---> [                               ] it's empty. how sad.  name: Nakita Age: 16 Sex: yes please Location:  Perth, Western Australia Pets: 2 cats, a dog and prince- the eastern rosella. fish too. koi. i think.  i have a couple of things to do in my spare time. i paint. and draw. and write stuffs, even though i'm not very good at any of it...oh well, i can try. i play netball three times a week, which i don't like at the best of times, but i have to find something to do when i'm not here. any comments on how to improve any pictures or posts are welcomed.   i'm addicted to the net, strategy games, music and my guitar.  i just painted my room! it's dark royal blue the bottom half, and dark dragon green the top. it has a strip of wall paper dividing the two colours, red to contrast with green, and orange to contrast with blue. very niceness.  *yawn*  hmm. i'm boring. i'm 5"7 hmmm. unique features about me. i have funky changy colour eyes. green when i'm cold, hazel when i wake up, and ugly murky greeny most other times. kinda wierd yet fun looking at photos.  i have an opinion on myself that i need to lose wieght, though most people just start arguments with me. grr. i like that word. grr.  i don't usually sleep at night, a night owl, a zombie. i lurk around the streets, when allowed. (i'm still only 16 though i wish i weren't)  i'm a capricorn: grounded, argumentative, always wants her own way, stubborn, out of touch, artistic, cool, responsible, reliable, honest and loyal. oh yeah, and a pain in the ass.  meh. that's all for now.

i returned a comment today. hehe. some fella reckons i have my head up my ass? i thought if you had your head up your ass you couldn't see anything? hmm. i actually think it might have been one of my friends from school, though it's hard to tell. well, she can't spell anyway. a boring day i found myself to be in today. nothing seemed to go right, well not really anyway. but that's pretty usual. i've had my photos developed from the school ball two weeks ago, i might shove some up here when i can be bothered.  down to my last coke, until netball anyway. damn.

Stress The confusion created when ones mind over rides the body's desire to kick  the living shit out of some asshole that really deserves it.  ever had a day like that?  this, my friends, is zombie's life.  *grin*
i can't wait to get out of here.  i'm being force fed five medications a day. -the pill, for iron and other things. -a mineral tablet to keep ,my health up due to the  -iron defficency tablets that arn't working so i'm consantly feeling like shit -an iron defficency tonic that tastes like shit, because the tablets aren't enough and -some tablet for insomnia to help me sleep- which by the way DOESN'T WORK.  see why i hate parents? all these things they dose me up on, forcing me to take them, as if i haven't already had enough of life as it is they shove all this shit into me, now if i stop the doses i probably will develop some disease or major flu that isn't curable. that's four tablets every day and a tonic, i'm only sixteen for god's sake.  i'm actually beginning to not only look like a zombie, but feel like one too. grr.
i had to get up at six this morning, it's seven now, the sun just waking. i woke up before the sun was up so decided to go for a quick walk. it's not the same as night, doesn't h
