Damn damn damn fuck fuck fuck! o my arrghh im am mad! this is the offical first vent on this site. they have me working on friday night when that was the one day i requested off! but nooooo i have to work and only 2 people could have taken my shift and one cant and i doubt the other can either!!! so mad i hate working! work sucks. if u dont already have a job dont get one they suck except for every few days a month when u get paid those are the only good days! ok i think i might be ok now.
yea so i cleaned my room again...went to work again...came home and had a quickie at the jacuzzi :) and that was the extent of my funfilled day! o my gosh! but yea anyhow PSA- For everyone that doesnt already know Erin is PORN! Jessica is a BITCH! and i am well we havnt decided yet but im sure we will find something but for now im just mads. yea i am one exciting person i know and sometimes you can't handle it but one day i will have u all trained to be my lil uhm poodles or something...whats this i here about multiply thumbs up on PCH that i missed chloe! damn i feel so unloved lemme just say.

YAY! Finals are finally over and guess what!? i survived! thats right i might not have passed but at least im still here.  to releive the stress that finals gave to us jess, erin and I went shopping! *Chloe i kno we said we were gonna go to hollister and not south coast but our plan changed! im sorry sweetie i should have called you!* but shopping was fun Abercrombie having big sale right now! erin bought a 4 doller abercrombie shirt even the boys have to give her some props for that one. i cant say the same for myself because well i didnt save so much but i have really comfy pants and a new shirt to show for my none saving-ness-ness or something... but yes this weekend should rock not only because it is a 4 day weekend baby but because the the sub club of The Club is meeting. Thats right its a singles club meeting... WoOt wOoT! but anyhow it still makes me laugh to think that some people whom i wont name think that Mr. Happy is a dildo! thats right folks but in all seriousness Mr. Happy is not a Dildo. but yea i think imana go do something semi productive...or just watch me some good ol' quality tele-vision.-muahs!
