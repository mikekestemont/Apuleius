hola all,    last night, i went into boston to "see" the red hot chili peppers play at one of the DNC parties. unfortunately, the stage was blocked from the street and we couldn't see anything, but we chilled on newbury street and listened to one heck of a rock show. anthony keidis and company played an awesome set even though they left out my fave ("under the bridge")! didn't really see to many celebrities. saw a couple of people who looked like they were important.     i've been on vacation this week. it's been nice having nothing to do! and i finally had time to clear some stuff up with school - i am now officially a full-time student! :-) and i just got my registration information from the school of public health. i have to choose whether i want to take epidemiology or essentials of public health law - fun stuff! :-)    poor donna! hope your day got a lot better after that incident! at least no one (especially you) was hurt! oh, and i have been to newport, but only for work. it's a beautiful place to visit and i would love to get down there one of these days for non-work related reasons - i will actually be there on monday all day for meetings and interviews for work. (very exciting stuff). i'll pump some of the people i have to interview for places to visit in the area. i'll let you know if i find out anything interesting for ya!    all righty, it's time to hit the hay! it's exhausting living this life of leisure ;-) too bad it's back to the grind on monday...have a great weekend everyone!!!
awwww poor Donna! :-( :-( :-( Don't worry about it; happens to everybody! Everything will work out okay. i love you! :-)
Today was going so well.&nbsp; I didn't oversleep.&nbsp; I hit no traffic on the way to work.&nbsp; The weather was beautiful.&nbsp; AND THEN...as I'm getting off the LIE at exit 49 S, it happens.&nbsp; I roll into a minivan.&nbsp; BAM!&nbsp; Just like that, I have become a statistic.&nbsp; I've never gotten into an accident before.&nbsp; The woman who was driving the minivan was stupid.&nbsp; She didn't roll down the window to talk to me.&nbsp; She just sat there and talked on her cell phone and CB radio, even though I was standing in front of her and waving for her to roll down the goddamn window.&nbsp; CB radio??? That's odd, thought I.&nbsp; I thought she might be some kind of work carpool service, because she had 3 non-related looking people in the van.&nbsp; Then I notice it - little writing on the side of the minivan - Helpers Assisting the Mentally Retarded.&nbsp; YEP, you guessed it!&nbsp; I hit a bunch of retarded people.&nbsp; LOVELY, the day is just getting better.&nbsp; So, she calls the cops, because its protocol, even though this is just a stupid little fender-bender, and my car was absolutely fine.&nbsp; Apparently, after waiting an hour, she realizes that she told the cops the wrong intersection.&nbsp; Ooops. The cops finally find us, maybe they were looking for the retarded people by the side of the road, I don't know how they did it.&nbsp; And then she decides to try to find her driver's license and registration - as if she didn't just have an hour to look for it.&nbsp; STUPID - what the hell did she think the cops were coming for, to play chess????&nbsp; UGH.&nbsp; So the cops get the info, we all make sworn statements, blah blah blah.&nbsp; I get to work and apparently more than a few of my coworkers saw me on the side of the road, so they all teased me about being against retarded people.&nbsp;   I need to go to bed.
Has anyone been to Newport?&nbsp; Dee and I were thinking of going at some point in the middle of August.&nbsp; We've never been, and I was just curious about things to do in the town, the museums, the restaurants.&nbsp; Someone in my office just got back from there and she said that she had a lovely time.&nbsp; I really really really want to go to check out the museums.&nbsp; I've been desperate to go see some of them since I studied this stuff in architecture history with caitlin!
Good grief I agree, Krissy! I couldn't figure out how to get from the Blue Blog screen back to where you can post! I did figure out how to make Comments on the other posts, but then I realized you cant really see those! But anyway... Cait, great idea to set this up! :-) I think it's AWESOME! :-) Whatcha doin' on your vacation? I hope you do somethin' fun.  I can't wait...only 9 more days of work! Not that I don't like it, but...:-). Both my bosses were kinda crankie today, but then they cheered up after I got them to chase an errant grasshopper (yes a real one!) that was living on the other desk in the room where I sit!  Darn, it's only 8:23 and the sun is almost set! I CANT STAND WHEN THE SUN SETS EARLY! hehe.  Karen, your sister looked BEAUTIFUL! My goodness! What a cool wedding!  I also can't believe our lil reunion was over a week ago! I was so lonely after everyone left! There's really no one as good as all y'all that came to Shea and Bayville...other people really don't compare. :-)&nbsp; ("Cannn youuuu feeeeellll the loveeee toniteeee....") hehe, I am in a goofie mood, can you tell!&nbsp; Thank you to everyone for coming and to those who helped set it up, too! I love how we all just pop back together and it feels like we never were apart. Awwww :-) Anyway, Hello to all and I misss you! ;-) Love always, Deee ps - here is a funny story: at my brother and Karen's block partyu, my neph Joey drank droplets of soda and beer from the cans in the RECYCLING BIN! EWWWW! :-)
