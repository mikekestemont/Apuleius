As I said in an earlier post, while in London, i had my wallet pickpocketed. I hope the lovely gentleman who did this gets run over by a steamroller and leaves his wife to pick him off the ground with a shovel, as if he wasnt an illegal immigrant but rather a hilarious coyote. i wasnt too upset about the wallet thing, until i fucking realized about the shit inside. Literally for like ten minutes after finding out about the wallet getting stolen I just sat with a smile on my face, the kind you have before you take out several pipe bombs out of your coat and massacre a small Colorado school. I was pondering about what was in it. Basically I lost a hundred bucks, my permit, my credit card, and like 6 different library cards. My parents encourage me to read but i choose to be an illiterate nothing and sit at home looking at pictures of 40 year old internet whores claiming to be 18.  Out of the stolen articles the only one I was really pissed about was the permit. I quickly canceled the credit card (I wish i was there for the moment the thief attempts to impress his slightly retarded pals by making a sandwich out of it), and by the time i found out about the wallet i knew the cash had been long spent(i hope the hooker that guy got gave him 16 std's, preferable 9 of them fatal). The permit pissed me off simply because i would have to deal with the DMV folk. You can tell these life-long losers from a mile away. The Mask of working at a dmv blemishes one for life.  at the dmv there was the usual line longer then the pubic hair of a 70's pornstar. when finally i got up to the counter i encountered the smelly stereotypical nothing who works at a DMV. the type with GED written on his forehead, and karl written on his nametag(the k is ofcourse backwards.not because our karl is trying to be cute and childlike, its because karl has the intelligence of a retarded kid sitting ona bench passing out chocolates.) well karl had to fill out the form for a new permit issuing and started asking me the usual questions. i cant blame him for doing it, its the poor bastards job. i can blame him for the look he gave me when i said i lost it in london. the stupid hick stared at me as if i was munching on a newborn baby while simultaneously burning an american flag. i had the biggest urge to just break a brick over his head while yelling "i m sorry if u stupid white trash has never left the state of illinois, dickwad" in his general direction. finally after another half dozen of these pleasant, casual encounters with people i wish were aborted 40-odd years ago by their crackwhore mothers, i finally walked out with a shiny new migraine...oh and a permit. and if u think this ended my encounter with the manual labor stupiddity that is customer service guess again. After canceling my visa after it being stolen i needed a new one. so i called the fucking hotline on the site and was met by the most ghettofied, nerve grating voice known to men. this stupid bitch was talking like she had a bit part in a rap video. shut up stupid, if i wanted to hear "whats up, whats goin on wit u" i wouldve popped in a dr. dre record not called a credit card hotline. Well she transfered me to another illegal immigrant with no handle on the english language, which wouldve been ok had i needed her to suck my cock BUT I NEED THE FUCKING BITCH TO EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT TO DO. after an hour or so of talking to a bunch of morons in deadend jobs, who apparently arent aware of that, i finally got my credit card. after writing all this i hope one person boring enough to read this whole thing leaves a comment.
Well alot of people i know (i wont call them friends for i am sure they just call me shithead behind my back.this doesnt make them mean, just makes them honest...i am a complete shithead) have been asking about the eurotrip(o how clever that serge is always using movie titles in everyday speach (elbow, elbow), i suck) so i suppose ill bore u to daeth with a page long recounting of an event that could be summarized in 3 words, I had fun. I will tell this in completely random order considering i have the concentration ability of a add kid fresh out of rida...lets go play tag. Basically the trip consisted of a group of kids from 15-17 in age. there were 2 groups one from chicago and one from oregon/washington state. thank god we chicagoans were in the minorities. the other people on my delegation were possibly the most boring, know it all, want to seem more mature then they really are, annoyinh bunch of douche bags ever. aside from tim, tim was just smelly and boring. and zach just followed. i sincerely hope everyone else on that trip, specifically no-chin nick and grandma, get hit by a semi just after watching their mother die from cancer and finding out their father was actually a homosexual who gave them aids when he butt raped them. the people from oregon/and washington were also, mostly, terrible pieces of crap worthy of a xyklon 2 filled gas chamber. there were exceptions. i am going to refer to these people often so i will make a list of the people from the trip who i didnt think were complete digshits: caitlin, matt, jayel, katie, kristie, zach. wow, out of 36 individuals i do not wish a painful death on 6. either i am very easily hated or hate very easily. For the first time in my life i met a mormon. that how i b
