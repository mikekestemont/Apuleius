First the good news. I have managed to get a GMAIL account,courtesy this blog.YES!!!!!!!! Last SAT Score -1580(800-English,780- math)  In case you are wondering,there is no bad news.Dare anyone say that the Feel-good factor is non-existent?
Shalom.  FINISHED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Yep.It's finally over.The Quizbook is finally done,all 1600 questions or 300 pages of it.Went to Pizza Hut for a celebration dinner.In the remote case that you are interested ,it wil be out by July and most probably all factory products wil be required to buy it.  SAT preparation in full swing.Last score 1540,ie 800 in verbal and 740 in maths While verbal scores have consistently been improving,math scores stubbornly refuse to move.Any suggestions??  On a sad note ,I have been called upon to discharge my duties as President of the Gandagi Safai Club.This involves giving horrible speeches about even more horrible topics like Earth Day.The silver lining is that Dimple Kohli,the head Safai karamchari has promised me that nothing much would be required in future from me.Also,Anupriya ,a fellow Safai karamchari and class topper(92%) has handed in her resignation,and i have managed to recruit two more people in her place from the wild section,who have a lot of free time to do Vela stuff like this.  On an another sad note,all the HOD's have stubbornly refused to let us have any free time in school.read going for GSP's and other activities.  Vote for the BJP,or ask your parents to do so.
Shalom. I started preparing for SAT today.I am giving the SAT on 1st May,which also happens to be my birthday. Yours truly will then complete 16 years of life on this planet.My centre is Modern School,Barakhamba Road,The Factory's arch-rival. This heralds a higly busy April for me.Apart from doing work for the quizbook, FIITJEE classes will start, an eternal source of stress and sorrow.Class 12th is in full swing with Monday tests around the corner.Added to this the additional burden of SAT .I have seriusly started thinking about night-outs,a concept i first discovered in IIT,Kanpur.
shalom.  For those of you who don't know ,i'm a class 12th student of Delhi Public School,R.K.Puram,henceforth referred to as The Factory.This year I have been extremely fortunate in getting all the HOD's as my teachers,something unprecedented in The Factory's history.  here's a description of my teachers-  1.J.S.Virdi(Da Sardar)-HOD Physics and my first ever sardar teacher.Quite good.Has threatened the class with dire consequences if anyone scores less than 95% in the Boards.Only problem-some wicked soul of the Timetable Deptt. has fixed all his periods with us at around 12'o'clock.  2.Meena Dhami(Da Owl)-HOD Chemistry.Being in her class is the surest way of getting into IIT.Last year,around 37 out of her 50 students made it ,a success rate of 74%.Has a penchant for treating students like 4-year olds and for physically acting out chemical processes. Sample-Reversible reactions are indicated by crossing arms,ionic bonds with interlocking of fingers.  3.Sushma Suneja(Odoyo ki maa)-HOD maths.Has an uncanny resemblance to the Kenyan cricketer Thomas Odoyo.Most of us believe that he is her son who was lost at the Kumbh Mela.Terrorizes class by randomly asking complex trignometric formulae.  4.Renu Nayyar(Da soporific)-HOD Economics.Has the enviable credentials of being the first teacher to have induced drowsiness in me since the legendary days of Sweezy Madan.  5.Rewa Mahajan(Da Penguin)-the only non-HOD teacher and also last year's classteacher.A highly strict but sincere English teacher,is known for giving astronomically high marks to the deserving and her PJ's. Sample-"Everytime you don't come in school shoes/belt/socks,i will fine you 1 rupee and by the end of the year,I'll be able to buy myself nice Banarasi saris".  I'll say it again though,i am extremely lucky in having them as teachers in my Board year and don't dream of having any others despite their shortcomings
shalom it is hereby proclaimed that akash bansal,person extraordinaire, has started a weblog to educate the lowly denizens of this world about his life and other important matters
Shalom.    Presenting the second part of the account of the past days      May 11    In a shocking,heart-attack causing election result,Chandrababu Naidu,India's most popular chief minister,after Narendra Modi of course,was voted out of power in Andhra Pradesh. His party,which had brought international recognition for Hyderabad and Andhra,was logged out of power with a paltry 47 seats out of 294,while the INC+ got 226.Though I had expected them to lose,this huge margin was certainly unexpected.     May 12   Day spent in extreme anxiety due to- a)SAT result after 2 days b)Election results the next day  I was very tense about my SAT result as everybody else who had given it in May hadn't done too well. And here I was ,hoping for a full score in atleast the verbal section.  Sight of the day-Sumanlata suggestively sucking a orange ice cream bar.I won't elaborate ,as being perverts,you will easily be able to guess what I am talking about.Manav ,take note.      May 13    First ,the Chemistry Quiz.   On behalf of Da Owl,yours truly,along with Manav and Anurag ,the 2 Quizzing Club Presidents,were supposed to organize and anchor the inter-section Chemistry Quiz for class 12. The teachers did a wonderful job in making the questions,a perfect blend of studies and trivia,which is what a quiz means to most of the world's inhabitants,barring a few Indians ,of course. I had also roped in Maanick,my nani's brother's wife's nephew,more popularly known as Sir Altitude and President of Unlimited Printouts Club for helping to operate the computers and of course,Siddharth Vyas,our resident Chinese (also known as Mr.Shanghai) for doing hard physical labour. I am an expert at such symbiotic delegation of duties.For both Sir Altitude and Mr.Shanghai,it was an excuse for missing Patalmata,Da Sardar and of course,Da Soporific's test,while for me,it meant having lesser things to do and concentrate on the more important things,namely asking questions.  It was also a day of the election results,so I will present a side by side account of both the results and the event of the day.  7.00 a.m-  We start off with the preliminary written round.20 questions,all quite interesting.  Some samples- a)Which is the only element which contains all the vowels in its name? b)Which beverage w
