First:  A bit of trivia.  John O'Tuomy* (1706-1775) owned an inn (pub?) in Limerick, Ireland, and was a well-known poet in his day.  Here's one of his poems, actually a limerick!      I sell the best brandy and sherry      To make good customers merry;           But at times their finances           Run short, as it chances,      And then I feel very sad, very.   *O'Tuomy is one of the spellings of the Toomey name.  Second:  The above limerick is perfect, as it relates so well to the props seen in many of the...  urlLink MORE PHOTOS!!    Woo-hoo.  Many thanks to Jim for these outstanding shots.   Anyone else have photos?  Let me know, I can either post them for you or you can provide the web link to them here.  Seems like the membership in ToomeyBlog continues to grow...let's hope we get everyone on board eventually.
OK, so I am a slow learner.   Shannon and I recently returned from our Nation's Capital. I will save all the gory details about the plane travel in light of the fact that we visited the WWII Memorial, so we should not be complaining about the minor setbacks we experienced. The most impressive features of the memorial are the 24 bronze bas relief sculptures along the ceremonial entrance. Each one tells a different story about the war. If you go take the Metro to the Smithsonian stop and wear your walking shoes.    urlLink
So far, 7 Toomeys are members of ToomeyBlog.  There are 22 more Toomeys/Dugans (with e-mail addresses) who we're waiting to join us here...hopefully soon!  I know there are questions about how to use this blog.  It's a little confusing at first; it took me a while to figure it out me-self.  So one of the big question marks is:  Commenting vs. Posting?  COMMENTING -- If you read something here at ToomeyBlog and want to add your two cents, just look for the "Comments" link at the end of that topic and click.  (If you're not logged in, you will be so prompted, then you can post your comments and you're all set.)  POSTING -- This is trickier.  Say you just got back from a trip and want to share a report with the rest of us.  This is just one example of when you'd want to create a new post (which others can then read and comment on).  So, where do you post your NEW story?  Doesn't look like there's any way to do it here, does it?  You're probably thinking the policy here is, "No ticky, no laundry."  Well...not so fast there, pardner.  You CAN get there from here.  First, you need to go to a different web page (meaning:  different than toomeyblog.blogspot.com).    That other page is known as your "Dashboard" page which is like a control panel.  To get there, go to   urlLink http://www.blogger.com/home    -- once you're logged in, you will see your "Dashboard" and you can create new posts from there, edit your own posts, or you can modify your profile if you want, etc.  And it will show up here.  (Important:  Be sure to add that page to your favorites/bookmarks so you can find it again.)    When you're at   urlLink your "Dashboard" page   you should see the "Create New Post" option.  Using that, you can type your post, preview it if you want, add hyperlinks in your text if needed, and publish it for all to see here.  Even though I set up the ToomeyBlog, it's for all of us to fully participate.  This is a team effort.  ToomeyBlog is all about TeamToomey, knowwhatI'msayin'?  Questions?  Comments?  Go ahead and add 'em here.
Thanks to my dad & Jane,   urlLink here's the first round   of what hopefully will be quite a few batches of photos from ToomeyPalooza held June 5, 2004.  (Another album at the link has some historical/archival Toomey family photos, including the Toomey Coat-of-Arms.)  If anyone else has photos from the 2004 reunion please share!  Whether links to your web photo albums, or files that you'd like me to add to the album at the link above, or printed photos (I can scan, and will reimburse you for prints/shipping), the more the merrier. Post comments to this topic if you've got 'em.
On June 5, 2004, about 100 Toomeys & Dugans -- all of the surviving children of Dr Gilbert and Frances Toomey, and their children, plus spouses/significant others and more children -- gathered at Aunt Peggy's condo for a long-overdue get-together which included much laughter, food, drink (and more drink), a marathon double-elimination Texas horseshoes tournament, and numerous photo-ops.  Uncle Bill provided free T-shirts with a great design: white shirt, with large green centered Shamrock, and the orange/yellow words saying: "Too Many Toomeys - June 5, 2004". Uncle Bob came with a Regis Toomey DVD. Uncle Pat held court and told stories until people's stomachs ached from laughing. Uncle Jack hosted a cookout at his home the next day.  The late Uncle Jim's wife and kids provided the extremely valuable family tree information and photos on CD-ROM and put on a PowerPoint slideshow. All three of the late Uncle Gil's kids traveled all the way from California for this special event.  A grand time was had by all. Some of the cousins are in discussion about a family web site; this blog can be one element of it.  This blog provides an immediate way for communication, discussion, comments, planning, news, updates, etc. All you have to do is create a free login ID and then youâ€™re free to comment away...
Robert-thanks for your patience and getting me blogged on. Wanted to give a quick synopsis of our Alaskan cruise last month. Joe and I went with our neighbors, Rich & Shelly.  Uncle Bill has a great story about meeting our neighbor Rich in a bar,while watching a Cleveland Indians game. Back to the trip:if you ever have the opportunity to visit Alaska, we highly recommend. The scenery was breathtaking and we had the best weather, per The Weather Channel, in 80 years. We were on the Carnival Spirit: 6/16 departed Vancouver B.C.; 6/17 sail day-incredible s
