EL papers were such a nightmare....   My paper one was... urgh. I failed my part one badly, with a score of 12... Ouch! But i managed to savage the situation by having 20 for report writing.. Heng passed!  I was only given 2 to 3 secs to glance at my marks and to see whether it was correct, so i didnt get to see my mistakes. Mw might want a redress, i heard.  As everyone were thinking of whether MW came today, i turned around and saw her right at the top of the lecture hall. We were all asked to go to comp lab.  I was sitting at my favourite spot in the Computer Lab 4 (with Made wasnt a choice) and was there with my paws on the table, waiting for my paper.  I wasnt very happy, i was shivering. Because it was cold.. Brrr.. When MW came to the part where she was going to talk about the chalet, SY and i armed ourselves; i took the mouse and aimed, she took her calculator. Blah, blah, blah... It turned out that MW didnt really say anything about it. Maybe because i stopped her?  As expected, i knew FG would win most of the catergories.. CA1 and EL P1... I was rather surprised later.. (*looks at SY from the corner of my eyes* I'm no sore loser either, you cant spite me!) I was observing MW all the while, and her eyes grew big when she saw the marks.  I told my mom the news when i got home, she was delighted. Oh well, it seems that i'm going shopping soon!
I thought i should give Old Chang Kee's curry puff a try, seeing that Aaronick has it for lunch. I thought it was good, so here's a few comments on it.  The filling's good, there's egg, unlike the usual stuff you have in curry puffs. There's taste- tinge of spice...  BUT, i hate the "skin" (what do u call it?) It's too flaky, too oily, the sides are too hard, and after a few mouthfuls it was really "ni4".  On the overall, i thought the one sold at Eunos is better. It's really Curry puff, cos the ones my mom bought had whole half eggs in it, and had chunks of chicken. The curry was fresh and good too; it wasnt too flowly nor like the old chang kee's. Old Chang Kee's curry in the curry puff seem rather old and starchy. Too potato-ish.  That's all i have to say....... Ol' Chunky's curry puff isnt that good as compared. No offence meant, okay?
Everytime i'm bored, i'd end up doing some silly quiz that i see at Rollay's.    Morpheus    urlLink   ?? Which Of The Greek Gods Are You ??     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
Mr Soon said that he sees students coming to school in the morn with their uniform tucked out. Well, then they go home with the uniform out. Disgracing the school all the way from home to school and back.  However, this way, displacement is ZERO. So does it really matter?  Ironically, i do not like students improperly dressed. But i do pity the boys, cos their shirts are rather short for their lengthy body. The uniform companies are pretty clever too- they print their advertisments on the uniform itself. I do feel unhappy about our school students, but i shant air my views here.
"BARD - verb. Past tense of the infinitive 'to borrow.' Usage: 'My brother bard my pickup truck.'"  urlLink [Source]   That is extreme for a learner, but I have in the past taught my students the phonetic way of saying a word, while trying to get them to forget the way it's written. That's because people who have difficulties hearing right resort to the written word, and pronounce it the way they would have in their mother tongue. Thus beard, here in France, would sound more like /bi: rd/. Nobody has bard this technique from me, yet. You can bar it if you'd like.   This is interesting... From  urlLink On English . I like this site a lot man, this is good.
MW intended to treat JT together with Mdm Rose for chalet. Apparently someone foiled the plans.. *grumble, looks at SY*  Me: When would you like us to help you with your table? I mean, help you with your shift. Btw, what about the English Premiere Cup?  MW: Dont worry about the shift. Probably next term. That teacher's foot is still injured. I've changed the Cup mechanics with FG out of the picture in the second half of the year. Btw...  Me: You mean we'll be competing with another class?  MW: I'll not take another English class next term so the competition will be among students within 3JT.  Me: What about the chalet?  MW: I'm sharing cost with Ros so whole class enjoys challet (sp mistake) but prize for one from me.  Me: There's always bound to be people unhappy about this.  MW: Why?  Me: Someone from FG beside me is complaining already. (at this pt in time, SY decides to intervene.)  SY to MW: (complains)  MW to me: Well, new Malay teacher will have to decide on another incentive program.  Me: MALAY TEACHER?!?!?!?! Btw, Ms Soh called me Jasmine again.  MW to me: Haha! Maybe she always wanted that name. Dont worry. You dont look like one.  Me: I'm not worried, i'm not meant to be in green tea anyway. She says i look like one of her students.  MW to SY: (something abt malay teacher teaching them.)  SY to MW: (something abt studying hard for Mid-yr so that they can clinche the chalet.)  MW to SY: (says FG may join JT chalet.)  SY to MW: Okay...  Me to Mw using SY phone (running all over the room running away from SY): no k. eunice here.  Me to MW using my phone: Arhhhhhhhhh!!!!!! Ok, i'm one selfish git.  MW to me and SY: Btw its somewhere near christmas so its going to be fun.  Me: How big is the chalet?  MW: I'll t
