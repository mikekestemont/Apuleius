Sitting in an airport in Cincinnati waiting for a flight to Champaign.  Im excited because in under four hours ill be with bubby and I havent kissed him in so long my lips have nearly forgotten the feeling. Hold on... I need a second to think about it... his warm moist yummy pink lips pressed against mine.... his body close enough for me to press myself against him... I try to slip him some tongue and he says ive gone too far and pretends to slap me and then giggles to himself. Why do my fantasies about him entail his play-rejection?  He does it too often its offending my psyche I think. No actually its adorable but still I should tell him to take his hamster seriously or she will take her roller ball elsewhere. We are so gonna make out and im totally gonna try to have my way with him when I get there. Its been almost 6 weeks and I think im getting carpal tunnel in his absence.       Havent slept yet and its almost 9 am- spent last night out in the city at a place called Le26 which falsely advertised as having Vietnamese food. Lets just say I had ravioli in this 'fusion' restaurant. Places are taking fusion too another level- I saw a guy getting a steak and French fries at another table. A funny food story (well as funny as i can be when I have yet to sleep) was a few weeks ago at Sushi Samba- We are slightly trashed by the time our table is ready and I keep ordering their raspberry Mohitos  and get to the part of the night where  I can barely see- let alone order food. Somehow I manage to decipher the wavy lines of scribble and order something made of little fishie (im a terrible person and definitely going to hell). My food gets to the table and im soOOoo excited (the kind of excitement you can only have over food when drunk) Well, about halfway through my meal I turn my plate a bit and let out an 'OH...Oh...oh... I think im gonna be sick' as I stared eye to eye with the poor little being whose flesh I was devouring. Salivation immediately- parasympathetics going wild- stomach starts to get funny. What have I become? Poor little animal. The guilt of being a carnivore is a discussion best left for another time... Back to Le26 (promise to stay more on track)- Heres a look at their normal clientell: theres a couple consuming eachothers faces at the table behind us; on the other side of us was a table or 25 year old- wanna-be-ballers... Suddenly I thought I was back in Miami. Once at BED I was making fun of the peoples snotty attitudes- I said something along the lines of  "these people take two hours getting ready, arrive, look fabulous, walk around being stuck up, and going home alone..." This guy says to me 'yeah but what you dont know is that half of these people are models or actors' to which my roommate deepa said 'well you can tell these models to bring me my next spinach salad at their real job.' I think you had to be there. Le26 ill try to start again.  Our waiter comes over to us and leans down next to me getting really close. I think hes going to ask us to move tables or ask me to ask my roommate to stop smoking- SOMETHING to show displeasure at having a table full of kids in his section. He had forgotten my drink order- no big deal but  after he leaves my friend says he thought the waiter was going to ask me out because of how close he got and how he looked at me... Funny how different my internal and external realities are. I still think I your typical punk-rock princess and anticipate peoples prejudices before I give them a chance to form an opinion... gotta remember I wear the studded belts on the inside now and people may be looking at me for reasons other that just to stare at "that girl."  On a completely unrelated note I think I want to have an RV instead of a first home, that way whenever I want to take off and travel to Disney world I can do it without a second thought. I wonder what my bubby will think of that- how he'll feel about parking his super-cars in front of a rv lot. Should I be offended if he says he wont come over? I think my plane just got hereÂ

Thank you to contraversion.com for making this guys ad public...   http://www.craigslist.org/sfc/m4w/33208956.html  heres a preview of the infinite wisdom he has to offer:  3- Miss Romance  This type of woman lives in a fantasy world of Lifetime Channel movies and romance novels. Every night she goes home alone to spend hours flipping through her bride magazines, imagining that, at any moment, Prince Charming will ride up on his white horse, sweep her off her feet, and offer her a problem-free existence for the rest of her life. The Miss Romances of the world have been coddled by parents and family, told they are "princesses," and have absolutely no idea that real life consists of paying bills and cleaning toilets. Miss Romance will expect to be taken care of, will be a dud in bed, and will, almost overnight, turn into a shrieking nag. Run.   I wonder if posting this makes me a 'miss-bitch'
