Well, I don't have too much to say. Me and Kris are going to hang out on Saturday so that should prove to be special. Also, my dad's cousin and her family are coming up to visit for about a week, so that should be cool. I haven't seen them in like 10 years. Me and Matt have been hanging out a lot, and me and Jen, since they live like right near me and I can bike or walk to their houses. Me and Matt went fishing yesterday and I caught a lot of seaweed. Oh, by the way Matt, I commented on your comment (finally) and I'm sorry it took so long. Well, nothing else to say, so byebye.
Oh my god this is stupid. My CD's are still not here. It has been a week and a half now, and still priority mail can't manage to get my a little box from Ohio to here.  I have barely talked to Kris lately, because she is always doing something when I'm not working (which is rare, since I am working Jen's hours also, while she is in Missouri) and the stupid payphone at camp doesn't work half of the time. I really want to see her. In any case, we still have the 31st coming up. There is NO way we are going to miss that because it is something we won't see again in a very long time. I guess I don't have much else to say, this has been a very boring few days. I'm going to go call Kris. Bye-bye.
The CD's that I ordered for my computer are STILL not here. That makes me very mad. I even paid extra to have them priority shipped. Not only that, I had $80 taken out of my last paycheck by the federal and state government for taxes, and they can't even bother to get some CD's from Ohio to here within a week. Ohio is only like 2 states away, and priority mail is supposed to come in like 2-3 days. But I'm sure they will come in tomorrow's mail, because I have to go to work at noon tomorrow, and therefore won't have any time to use them until 11pm when I get out...  I have to work at 4 today, so I really don't have that much time to do anything. Maybe I'll walk to the bank and deposit my paychecks that I have been collecting in my failure to make it to the bank. Oh yeah, I have to remember to deposit that check that is $80 SMALLER THANKS TO OUR LOVELY GOVERNMENT!  Sorry, I tend to get stuck on a topic when I am aggravated. I want to see Kris... I want to be held... :-( I feel lonely... Jen's on a plane on her way to Missouri, and I haven't seen Kris in like a week lol but it seems like forever... she was feeling really sick yesterday, I hope she's feeling better... Anyways, I guess I should probably go, I'm going to find something to do...  "Lately I've been wishing I had one desire, something that would make me never want another, something that would make it so that nothing matters, all would be clear again. But I guess I'll have to settle for a few brief moments, watch it all dissolve into a single second... you know that she's gone, 'cause she left you a song that you don't want to sing..."

Well, I didn't talk to Kris all day today. It kinda sucks a bit, but that's okay. I have been sleeping real late the past few days and that makes me feel like crap for the whole day, but I finally figured out that my alarm clock was set to use the radio instead of the beeping thing, and the radio was tuned to silence so that's why it wasn't waking me up. So that will finally be fixed.  I am really being torn in two directions right now. I don't really know how to act. On one hand, I want Kris to know that I really love her and think she's the greatest person in the world, because it's true, and I think she needs to know how wonderful she is, and that she shouldn't be so down on herself. On the other hand, I don't want her to think I'm rushing things too much and end up scaring her out of wanting to be in a relationship, because I often move too quickly and suffocate people. I just want to do what is right, what will ensure she is comfortable. I really love her, I don't want to move too quickly or say the wrong thing and ruin this, but I also don't want her to think I'm not going to be really serious about a commitment if she is ready for that. I (once again) wish I could read minds. ARGH.  Too bad I can't just be happy that we are together, and take things as they come, and just say things as they come to me and let everything run naturally... I always worry too much, I always think I'm doing something wrong. I think I'll just do what feels right as time goes on, take it one day at a time. Except for the 31st, of course, I have to have at the very least SOME sort of plan, even a really rough one, because that night is going to be the most magical night we'll ever have I have a feeling. I don't want to plan too much, because then I get disappointed if it doesn't happen, but I do want to make sure that when I tell her what the day is it comes out right. :-/  PS- In case you guys are noticing posts appearing with dates on them from like days ago, yet they are just popping up, that is because I am posting them offline and they are just not getting published until the next time I connect to t
