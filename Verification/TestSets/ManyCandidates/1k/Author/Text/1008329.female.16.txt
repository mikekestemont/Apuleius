Sorry, but I gotta..I couldn't remember the words and it was driving me insane...  Artist : Lisa Loeb  Song : I Do   When I'm done with thinking, then I'm done with you When I'm done with crying, then I'm done with you When I feel so tired, then I'm done with you Everybody feels this way sometimes, everybody feels this way.  And I do. You can't hear it, but I do. You can't hear it, but I do.  You're trying to convince me, that what I've done's not right I get so frustrated, I stay up every night. You ask me for an answer, and I'm so tired and I'm up in the air (I'm up in the air) Everybody feels this way sometimes, everybody feels this way  And I do. You can't hear it but I do You can't hear it, but I'm feeling this way just because you say  I will be ignored I will be denied I could be erased I could be brushed aside I will get scared, and I will get shoved down but I feel like I do because you push me around.  I'm starting to ignore you, I doubted you so long, I'm tired of over-thinkin, I know you don't belong Now I'm asking questions, No one pushes me around, Everybody feels this ways sometimes, Everybody feels this way  And I do You can't hear it but I do You don't seem angry but I do I do.
maybe I do like "dog"..
HoLa. ¿Como estas? Ay yi yi. Babysitting: made $18. Woo. Kinda. I need to get $20 more for this sweater @ AE I want. I also want a kahki jacket lined with that sheep's wool stuff. There's one @ AF. Yah know what's stupid? As soon as I'm off groundation, Lloyd is on. Y LLOYD Y?! Ah. Pinche Madres. What else to say...  I like kiwis.   Do you ever find yourself thinking about someone? I do. I'll be thinking about someone then I'll feel stalker-like and stop. It's scary sometimes. Not a guy or someting, just like a friend you don't talk to anymore. Like..I sometimes am like:Man, haven't talked to Sophia in awhile..  I have Lisa Loeb stuck in my head, and the scary part is..I DON'T LISTEN TO HER! weird..  I'm out for now. Xxo0   "What you feel is what you are and what you are is beautiful..."-Goo Goo DoLLs, "SLiDe"
Yah, just so you all know...I don't like "dOg" anymore.
Hey evry1. I'm in first period. WoO. Yah.  Thanks David..for saliva..  LoLiDoLiDoO.   Gosh, I am so bored. SAve me. Damn, and third period I have PE. Do you think I'm crazy b/c I bring another shirt to change into after PE? My first one gets all stretched out with all the taking on and off. YaH. So.  It was so sad b/c Clinton made it so people that needed welfare could get it regardless of conditions. That law or whatever it is he made, runs out this year two days after xmas. That means that all the people that are on welfare are going to be pennyless. California has it the worst. It is said it is going to be the worst welfare cut in California. Gray Davis is trying to delay the cut just enough so everyone on it can be fine. There's said to be a estimate of 300,000 people on welfare. May god have pity on their souls.   Eat your heart out.
O. I was sick from school today. Fun times. That's all. Nothin'....
gosh im bored
....
I don't like people that are always talkingabout how many people like them b/c they want you to think they're hard to get and just talking to you is amazing and you should appreciate it. Whoa. News. Who gives a shit? Not me. Get a life.  Itz amazing b/c...well it is. And I like..yah. And I think he knows. Cuz he asked. And I said no. And I'm writing in fragments. Cuz itz cool. SUE ME!  LaLaLA.La. Tomorrow is gEeTaR(guitar). YeEhAW!   Man, I love staying home alone but my family won't leave me alone anymore. They don't trust me. After I threw that mad rave..nothing has been the same.  Something Corporate is soft..mellow..kinda trying to be hard...I dunno..AH.  I'm so confused. I was called "crazy" like 298362378637 times today. Just 'cuz in PE I would stare off n2 space then laugh. It's b/c I think of something funny. Nothin wrong with that, foo!  Godsh..running...away..toodles...   If you would be my punk rock princess I would be your garage band king... -Something Corporate
HeLLo. Still in first period. Such fun times. We have to do research on a certain vitamin. Mine's on vitamin E for obvious reasons. Jessica Lloyd is sitting here next to me. Laura Ramos is "absent". :-P PoOP! I feel really sick right now. My eyes are all watery and I look high. My nose is all sniffly. I've been sneezing and coughing. It's a wonderful life. I need vitamins...  Yah know what's really cool? Old music. Alternative, some pop. Stuff from the mid-to-early nineties and before. Like..Blind Melon, Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins..all those old favorites.   Ahh "Cat" is very annoying. I think he thinks I like him just because of one time I took advantage of a situatioN(no not what you're thinking, sicko). So..I hope not. Let me clear this up. If you're reading this...I don't like you. HAHAHAHA.   Uhoh. I have nothing really to say and the teacher said we need to finish these by the end of the period. So LAtEr 4 NoW..... x0x0x0x0
