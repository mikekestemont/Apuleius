urlLink Human Body Version 2.0   In the coming decades, a radical upgrading of our body's physical and mental systems, already underway, will use nanobots to augment and ultimately replace our organs. We already know how to prevent most degenerative disease through nutrition and supplementation; this will be a bridge to the emerging biotechnology revolution, which in turn will be a bridge to the nanotechnology revolution. By 2030, reverse-engineering of the human brain will have been completed and nonbiological intelligence will merge with our biological brains.

urlLink Dale H. Emery — Managing Yourself Through Change   Major change is difficult. Unexpected change is even more difficult. In this paper, I offer some possibilities for navigating change more effectively.  In this paper, Dale H. Emery present a model of change, which describes the stages we go through as we respond to change. Next he look at why each stage happens, why we respond the way we do, and how we move from one stage to the next. Then he offer some ideas about how to respond more effectively in each stage.

urlLink The Rational Edge -- September 2003 -- Agile RUP for non-object-oriented projects   The Unified Modeling Language (UML) and IBM Rational Unified Process,® or RUP,® are standard fixtures on most object-oriented projects today. UML is a notation for visually expressing object-oriented concepts; RUP is a process framework that uses the UML to express the content of its artifacts and tasks. But what do RUP and the UML offer that portion of our software community doing non-object oriented development? This article is my answer to that question. As we shall see, RUP and UML can be used quite effectively on software projects in COBOL, C, or even (the dreaded) assembler language.

urlLink Project Management World Today February/March 03 - Education and Careers   The author describes three characteristics of weblogs that make them suitable for project teams:   Easy, fast, and continuous communication  Personalisation and identification  Automatic storage of knowledge   He argues that virtual teams must overcome physical separation. All that makes sense. But there's more too it than that. Project teams need to be in charge of their projects. They need confidence while exercising judgement. The p-log just might be the tool.

urlLink elearnspace. everything elearning.   Learner-centered, lifelong learning has been the cry of knowledge society visionaries for the last decade. Yet learning continues to be delivered with teacher-centric tools in a twelve week format. Society is changing. Learners needs are changing. The course, as a model for learning, is being challenged by communities and networks, which are better able to attend to the varied characteristics of the learning process by using multiple approaches, orchestrated within a learning ecology.
urlLink Free Range Learning Support   When you were three or four years old, you asked a lot of questions about the world you experienced.  Why is the sky blue?  Do fish drink?  Why does the moon follow us?  Given your developing command of language and curiosity, it was an easy and rewarding way to augment your experience of the world. By the time you reached six or seven years old, you probably stopped asking so many questions about the things around you. Perhaps you realized that the endless stream of questions began to annoy more than charm your parents. Perhaps you learned how to find the answers yourself. Perhaps, as many learning theorists suggest, your schooling had acclimated you to posing "appropriate" questions and giving "correct" answers.  In my master’s project thesis, I hope to reawaken and re-enable this spirit of inquiry and engagement in the world for adult l
