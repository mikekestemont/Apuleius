A pivotal exchange at the June 10, 2004 press conference:  Q: Mr. President, I wanted to return to the question of torture. What we've learned from these memos this week is that the Department of Justice lawyers and the Pentagon lawyers have essentially worked out a way that U.S. officials can torture detainees without running afoul of the law.  So when you say that you want the U.S. to adhere to international and U.S. laws, that's not very comforting. This is a moral question: Is torture ever justified?  BUSH: Look, I'm going to say it one more time. Maybe I can be more clear. The instructions went out to our people to adhere to law. That ought to comfort you.  We're a nation of law. We adhere to laws. We have laws on the books. You might look at these laws. And that might provide comfort for you. And those were the instructions from me to the government.  So the question was: is torture ever justified?  Seems like a "yes" or "no" question to me.  But the answer was: Bush gave instructions to adhere to law.  That dodge, coupled with the growing stack of legal opinions on the subject, pretty much spells "YES" in all caps.  So who does Bush think he's fooling here?  Does he really think that Americans are that stupid?  The sad truth is: yes he does.  Sadder yet, looking at the polls that still show over 40% of Americans think he's doing a good job, he's not completely wrong on that point.
So let's get one thing straight: when the photos, videos, and stories of prisoner abuse in Iraq and Afghanistan hit the news, the Bush administration says it's the work of "a few bad apples."  No connection whatsoever to the folks in charge.  No way, no how.  By the same reasoning, when the military does something well, such as capture Saddam Hussein (after the kurds have told us where he was), do we hear that it's the work of "a few good apples?"  Hell, no.  Bush and company are only too willing to take credit for the good news, but won't touch the bad news with a ten foot pole.  How's that for returning accountability to the White House?
Sometimes it's the little things that people say in unguarded moments that provide a glimpse at their innermost feelings.  Way, way, way back in the early days of the Bush administration, a reporter asked Dubya how he thought things were going between him and Congress, to which he replied "It would be a heck of a lot easier if this were a dictatorship... as long as I'm the dictator."  When I first heard those words, it sent a chill down my spine.  Although he chuckled after saying this, it's clear that he wasn't joking around.  This administration has shown nothing but contempt for the system of checks and balances inherent in the three branches of the Federal Government.  John Ashcroft's disgraceful performance at a recent Senate hearing pretty much says it all: "screw you fellas, we'll do what we want."  I guess the next best thing if you can't be a dictator is to act like one.
You've got to see "The Official Re-election Site for President George W. Bush" these days.  While John Kerry puts his campaign on hold out of respect, the Bush campaign seeks to profit from Reagan's timely demise.  Just when you think they can't get any more shallow, they manage to drain a little more water out of the pool.  As if that weren't enough, reports say Bush managed to diss Reagan during an interview with Tom Brokaw on Sunday.  When asked if he considered himself a "Reagan Republican," Bush responded that he was a "George W. Republican."  Dubya managed to pull off an amazing feat: pissing on another man's grave before he was even in the ground.  The real irony is, a year or two from now, I'm guessing you won't be able to find anyone who would have the nerve to call himself a "George W. Republican."
Way back when in the early days of the Bush administration, "transparency" was quite a buzzword.  They spoke of how other governments should be "transparent," allowing the world to see what they were up to.  Talk about "do as I say, not as I do."  It has been well-documented that the Bush administration is a veritable black hole of information.  Read "Worse than Watergate" by John Dean for an excellent summation of the use of secrecy by the Bushies.  Yesterday, Attorney General Ashcroft repeatedly refused to release a potentially damaging memo regarding interrogation techniques to Congress.  Instead, he flatly refuted Senators' statements, in essence saying "trust us."  For folks with nothing to hide, these guys sure hide a lot.  But the really sad part is that there will are some Americans out there that are okay with that.
Next to the Sopranos, nobody circles the wagons to protect the family quite like the Bush administration.  For some time now I've been thinking that this White House runs like the Mafia; you cross them, you get whacked.  Valeria Plame, meet Adrianna.  Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction, with the guy running the whole operation who isn't all that stable upstairs. I wonder if Dr. Melfi can find an hour or two to listen to Dubya?  Ah, fuggedaboudit...
This morning there was a brief newspaper article noting that the Kerry campaign is taking the week off out of respect for the passing of President Reagan.  This move includes re-scheduling two big fund-raising events.  Let's take a trip to the bizarro world and try to imagine what the Bush campaign would do if the roles were reversed.  For example, if it was Jimmy Carter lying in state, does anyone think that Bush would take more than his usual nap time off from chasing a buck?  Me niether.    The article also mentioned that Kerry gave the commencement speech at his daughter's graduation, and refrained from talking politics.  Contrast that with the Bush campaign's recent commencement speeches, which I believe contained political messages.  W
