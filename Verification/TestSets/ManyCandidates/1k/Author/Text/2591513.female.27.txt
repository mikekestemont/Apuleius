I actually don't know where to begin.  I don't know whether to start in tears...or to be happy that I am still here...I don't know.  Well my birthday is in a few days and I can't bring myself to be excited.  I think maybe because I am having a very hard time affording school and I am torn between staying in school or probably taking the semester off...but I can't do that, we are so depending on this financial aid...that mind you isn't that great...thanks to all those bastards that cheat the frickin' system and take all the frickin' money for students like me, who can't afford to go to college because we have KIDS!  UGH  Do NOT get me started on all of that.  I am so tired of all that BS.  That is what it is.  Money should be given to does who deserve it and will use the money towards funding their education...not for gambling...buying frivolous things...let me tell ya...  Anyway, life is okay...well that is about it...
Okay, so I showered late and cannot go back to sleep.  I am tired though.  The puppy was crying.  Ed had to put him to sleep and then put him on his bed and then silently go upstairs.  We had to trap him in the kitchen because he is scared of the laundry room...mom put him in there while the dryer was running.  I would be scared too.  Ed spent the evening chasing him around to use the potty on his training sheet.  LOL  Yeah that was fun.  A couple of accidents,  but in the end, he did use it on the sheet.  Now how we are going to keep that up with Ed gone...that will be interesting.  I have had a lot on my mind.  A lot of things I talk about here.  A lot of things I don't.  The things I don't talk about are the things I can't deal with right now.  So I shove it behind.  The bad thing is it builds up.  My birthday is in less than 2 weeks.  Wow, already?  Where did the time go?  Too bad you can ask people to pay your bills...haha...that would be a GREAT GIFT....just kidding...well maybe not...haha  I feel like I am always trying to catch up to something I cannot catch up to.  I don't know.  i can't really explain it...oh to be in my mind, huh?
We have a new family member...STITCH...he is so so cute, ask Leila...but according to Mica, he will turn ugly when he gets big.  We got him at a pound like 40 minutes away...he is an energetic puppy (A Black Lab mix).  He is too cute and sure does live up to his name Stitch.  Bailey had the honor of naming him.  We wanted him to hook up with Kawaii (not really like that, that would be a funny looking dog...haha) but anyway, it won't happen because Kawaii is a Gay.  I told Jess that it was okay because Stitch will probably be a gay too.  haha  i am saddened by a chain of events involving my immediate family and not so immediate family.  So much miscommunication and carrying grudges makes family unity so difficult.  There are somethings I have to change, like my attitude towards someone (you all know who I am talking about...and no she isn't related to me...thank goodness)...but that is hard when they don't make an effort to be nice.  You know?  Anyway...it will all happen when she grows up and starts showing some respect.  Well the other problem, I won't get into...but know this...money can only take you so far...once money takes you away from your family, it has taken you in the wrong direction.  I will NEVER let money become an issue in my family...not to this extent...and I will NEVER do business with family.  Too many unpredictable things can go wrong and too much to risk....  I hope you all (umm...that would be Leila and Mica...haha) have a good weekend.  I have a butt ton of homework to do.
I haven't posted too much because I was starting to get sick and feeling the onset of depression.  Thank goodness I still have my sister to use as a sounding board.  My life in these past few weeks of 2004 has been filled with loss.  I hope to start off hte next month on better footing.  But the good thing about experiencing all this loss is that I have come to so very interesting revelations and insight.  Thank goodness.
No dog, the lady never called...oh well...that just means to look for one closer to home and that isn't such a bad thing.  I am a little peeved at people and their priorities...but that is just me.  I am not even going to go into it.  It is life and I am trying not to harbor any ill feelings to anyone...workd for most the time, not to one person in particular, but those of you who read this know my beef with that someone...haha.  And NO that someone is not related to me.  So anyway, today everyone is feeling sick, bad timing with school just starting and all.  I don't want to have to do this semester begging my professors not to drop me.  Although I have already.  I miss my first day of class because my uncle's mother passed away.  I don't want to miss her funeral.  My uncle Mike is a great man and I would like to be there for him and his family.  It is sad.  I know he must be having a hard time.  Lately I have been full of sadness for my husband's friend's passing.  After hearing how he took his life I am brought back to my past and remembering feeling like there was no other alternative but to take your life.  Of course back then it was young adolescent stupidity...but that feeling was so real.  So thinking about how rock bottom he must have felt.  It makes me sad.  I also think heavily about the daughter who will grow up w
