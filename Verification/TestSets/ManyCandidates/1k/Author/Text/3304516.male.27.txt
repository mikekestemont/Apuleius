Lucky me It's happened again I went out with you And lost one more friend  I wanted to try it out I hoped for the best But when the moment came Our love failed the test  It looks as if I am The one to blame once more It's because of me That you walked out my door
I wish I could show you What you mean to me But feelings are felt They're things you can't see  Living up with you Was sometimes tough But now I find I don't see you enough  Times growing up When we were young Remembering when We'd have so much fun  To sum it all up I love you dear sis When you're not around You're constantly missed
Try and fail, try and fail How come I just can't prevail  In a wolrd of run down schools Stupid books and teaching fools  Places where real intelligence Is just pure coincidence  Where the workplace is a rat race Always going at a fast pace  No matter how hard I try I can't succeed and don't know why
In memory of you I've written some lines To reminiss On our happy times  Days in the past When we had such fun Your old life is over But your new one's begun  It's so very sad To see you go But we'll meet again This much I know
My brother has left To start anew And build a little home  Yet I'm still here All by myself Jealous and alone  So proud of him My parents are He's doing something good  But when I try To do my thing I get misunderstood  I've looked up to him For most of my life He sure has done alot  One thing's for sure This thought endures My brother I am not
I thought I saw something In your face That spoke of a love true  But my instincts They were misplaced I was wrong about you  You chewed me up And spit me out Like tasteless bubble gum  Now I see How you used me And left me feeling numb  I've got a plan I'll take your things And throw them in the fire  I don't want stuff Given from A vengefull, heartless liar
When I was a kid I lived on a farm I'd walk through the forest Or play in the barn  When I was a kid I had a pet cat She'd sit in the sun Or play with a rat  When I was a kid Everything was fun I'd just d
