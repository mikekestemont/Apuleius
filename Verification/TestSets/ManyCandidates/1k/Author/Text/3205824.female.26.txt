urlLink The New York Times > National > Survey Finds U.S. Agencies Engaged in 'Data Mining'  Another chapter in the national debate opens: security vs. civil liberty.  Problem is, the old laws governing privacy don't tell us that much.  Based on the principle that a man's house is his castle, common law learned to stop the government at the threshold.  But there was an epistemological concept already available: for square walls told the law exactly where to stop.  Where exactly do we stop with data mining?  a few possibilities:   1) data mining creates a fundamentally new fact out of information merely lying about.  The new information needs to be moderated.  the government keeping data is ok, the government applying search programs is not.  - argument: If I visited your orchard, stole apples, and made applesauce, the applesauce isn't mine just because i applied my labor to it.   - but: intellectual labor is different; seeing houses in the city, I am free to argue whatever I please about the nature of city life.  intellectual material is fundamentally public and can't be owned in the same way, can it?  ah, if only we had good reasons for believing in intellectual property.  but what a world of problems it would confuse to people making judgments about others based on gossip, sight, or reading too much.    2) data mining is inevitable, but what government can do with its results should be limited.    - problem: how do you limit seemingly certain knowledge?  aren't we headed for Minority Report?  aren't there fatal errors in any model? - devil's advocate: is the correct leftist response to encourage data-miners to use -better- and -richer- data, so as to designate free-speech activists apart from terrorists, and leave Nader's campaign manager alone?    philosophers, help!  What Would Locke Do?  stay tuned for the Minow report, due today...
The consultants are telling me: getting rich is for buying time.  The sooner you get rich, the more you can do with your time, the sooner.  The academics are also telling me that they have found the only career where one can be paid to use one's time to read books.  more questions for the time-machine engineers:  what kind of time are you producing?   who can you access with it?    On a related note, applause for those in Washington who are throwing "salons" in the eighteenth-century style.
Today, an NPR story about former Mujahideen warlords who have remained armed and in power due to coalition incompetence or impotence.  The latest rumor asserts that they will pull together to forward their own candidate for Afghanistan's upcoming elections.    It isn't unsuprising that power stays in place unless deposed.  The ideology of democracy seems to suggest that wise intervention deposes corrupt old regimes for new.   Yet American experiments in tinkering with alternate powers have gone awry in South America and Haiti.  Afghanistan seems to be a first experiment with another way: leaving the old power in place.  But the situation seems to indicate wishful thinking on America's part.  Will Afghani warlords really just go away after generations of intimidating their own?  Aren't their alliances too set?  Even if we deposed a few, wouldn't the same power structures generate new heads, like a hydra?    About a decade or more ago, students of colonialism used to encounter the dread "Cambridge School" of Indian history.  The Cambridge School historians attempted to show how British rule had  cultivated relationships with the Indian elite, many of whom were willing collaborators.  The British, after all, didn't announce "democracy" immediately and hand the country over to whatever alliances formed naturally.  Nor did they try to engineer a new ruling class out of thin air.  It is a model of sorts.    The Cambridge School is now among the great effigies trashed on a regular basis among colonial historians.  Their work rings is too sceptical of Indian nationalism.  It gives too little credit to rank-and-file organization.    But neither the courage of the masses nor the idealism of the historian can alter the existence of elites.
A businessman recently asked a philosophy professor who received his fellowship with particular grace, "Why do academics hate people like me?"  Everyone knows that philsophers, historians, and aesthetes pride themselves on eschewing material gain.  Since about 1980, academics in the humanities also pride themselves on rallying the Left, decrying the military, and shooting down big business.  One possible reason for the acidity of these positions is the gradual decay of other positions for Leftists.  Historian Ellen Schrecker has shown how McCarthyism effectively demolished a Leftist professional struggle in the State Department during the 1950s, sending most radicals into local politics, organizing, or academia.  Legal scholar Richard Posner describes how Republican appointments of the 80s stuffed the courts with Republicans, leaving the brightest Democrats no choice but teaching to act as public servants.   And once an institution is formed, it tends to replicate itself.    The deeper effects of a recalcitrant university as the primary organ of education in America are worth thinking about.
Berkeley sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild has documented the rise of the "time bind" in modern society: an increasing pressure to appear on the job for spiraling numbers of hours, a syndrome that affects factory workers as well as executives, datable from the early eighties in America.  Hochschild is concerned about what the "time bind" means for American families.  Do ninety-hour-a-week clocking consultants get to know their children?    Economists and journalists tend to shrug at Americans' hard-working habits.  When asked, most hour-clockers concede that they wouldn't know what to do with themselves if they had more time.  A house full of strangers is less stimulating than adrenaline-flooded work for those accustomed to the rush of task-oriented stimuli.  But among the most significant lessons to draw about the "time bind" is how people become accustomed to spending time in different ways.  Adults in their fifties remember clearly the discussions of three-hour work-weeks mooted in the 1970s.  Historians reckon that the three- or four-day weeks was prevalent in Western Europe until about 1820, when Sunday School teachers, factory managers, and the police conspired to murder the e
