I just need to express how much I love  urlLink Ros Moss .   [Tomorrow is one of her "From the Heart" shows on Catholic Answers, so tune in!]
I’m having one of those periods where you feel lackluster. I feel it at work, but especially personally. The thoughts keep racing through my head….my career isn’t getting off the ground, I’m not making the money I need to make, I eat too much, I weigh too much, I don’t look pretty enough, I don’t say the right things, I don’t do the right things….blah blah blah.   So I try to balance it the words of Padre Pio: Pray, Hope, and Don’t Worry. I even have that phrase displayed in my office, just to remind me. But I do pray, I do hope, but I worry 25 hrs a day.   It’s a faith and trust issue. Letting go and trusting God to work in my life would lessen my worry tremendously. Not doing so is saying that I don’t completely have faith in God to shape my life in the way that’s best for me.   I suppose that’s the eternal struggle in living of a life of faith.
I read  urlLink this story  and got disgusted.  Then I read  urlLink this story  and thought, "There really is justice in the world!"
Until the last couple of years or so, I had a problem learning how to enjoy simple things. I was so overcome with worry and anxiety in my life that I couldn't let myself enjoy anything.   Little by little, I'm getting there.   Today was definitely a simple pleasure, and I enjoyed every second of it.   when I moved here last July, I rented the upper part of an old home. when the lower part became available, I jumped on it, even though the rent was higher.   Now I have two bedrooms, a dining room, a large kitchen, a frontdoor, a back door,a basement, and a yard. I feel like I almost actually own a home.   My father is up this weekend, and he brought my grandmother's dining room table for me, so today I bought a very pretty tablecloth and table runner...sort of shabby chic style. I bought a tomato plants and sweet basil and strawberries and spent the evening with my dad planting them in my backyard. As I filled up my new watering can, I felt giddy. Actually giddy.   And I thanked God where my life is now as opposed to where it was a year ago today. I moved to a new city, I got a new job, I passed a bar exam,and I have this great apartment (even though old homes bring a host of little problems).   Sure, I pat myself on the back a bit. It took a lot for me to make this move, coming here with no job and enough money for just a few months. But it's because of Him. I completely credit God for all of this.   I have a long way to go. I still am struggling to pay my bills, to get my license to practice (being held up for an ethics investigation because of financial problems and a bankruptcy), but I'm slogging along.  God is good, and life is good, and simple pleasures are so incredibly wonderful.
for a brief administrative message.  Thanks to all who emailed me about comments not showing up. They weren't showing on the blog, nor were they being emailed to me.  I think it was the template I was using. Hopefully it's now fixed.   Comment away and let's test it out!
Marc North does street photography in San Francisco.   urlLink This photo  made me stop and think about life, and faith, and about my duties as a Christian. (note what's in her hand in case you don't look closely enough)
I watch TBN for fun. I'll admit it.   I've been tremendously entertained the past two weeks by  urlLink Jentzen Frankin's  presentation called :   Keep Your Underwear On: Control Your Need to Breed   You know, I can't imagine a Catholic priest standing up and giving this speech, but I think I'd pay to see it.   I remember saying the same thing here on the blog a month or two ago about people who are into the toothing craze.   Keep your underwear on!!!
God, in His infinite and perfect Wisdom, has allowed me to make so many mistakes in my life such that I’ve become a very, very late bloomer. My birthday is about a month away, and every year at this time I ruminate, so bear with me. At any rate, most of my peers have been in settled into their careers for 10 or 12 years by now. Most of them are married and having kids. And here I sit, trying to begin my career with no man in sight anytime soon.   A co-worker told me yesterday that she’s pregnant. And it made me wistful. She was an older bride (36) and she’ll be an older mom, so it’s still entirely possible for me.   But I felt wistful.   Being a late bloomer has its advantages. I think I’m more sure of what it is I actually want now. I’m hopeful that once I do find a husband, I’ll be going into a marriage for all of the right reasons and it’ll have a better shot at lasting.   But honestly, right now it just feels a bit lonely, and a bit hopeless, which isn’t very faithful of me, because in God there’s always hope.   I’ve been thinking about all of my ex-boyfriends and all of the mistakes I’ve made. Some of it, I wish I could change. Some of it was unpleasant, but I learned important lessons.   And that’s the beautiful gift of our free will. God let me go, He let me make those bad decisions. And that’s the most loving thing He could have done for me, because now I know that I’ll never make them again.   God’s greatest gift to me has been my imperfection
