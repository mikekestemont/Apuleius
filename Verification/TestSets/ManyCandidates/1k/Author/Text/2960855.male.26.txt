An elderly man recently diagnosed with a brain tumor leaped to his death from a vintage airplane he rented to celebrate his 88th birthday, officials said Tuesday.  Joseph Harold Frost took off his safety belt at 300 to 400 feet, stood up in the open cockpit of the two-seat biplane and went over the side Monday.  The pilot tried but failed to wrestle him back into the plane and nose the aircraft upward to force Frost back into his seat.  "I think that was Dad's idea, to go out in a flash of glory," said Robert Frost, who had helped his father arrange the chartered flight on a biplane similar to the ones the elder Frost flew in World War II.  The man landed on an apartment patio, horrifying those who witnessed it.  "I saw him hit the power lines, heard trees breaking. I really thought it wasn't real," Cynthia Lankford said. Um, ya think? Most people who see a man falling from the sky would probably be in a state of shock and not think it's real. But I bet the people who had to clean up their patio thought it was pretty damn real.  So, this begs the question. Now, I know that no one WANTS to die, but it's pretty apparent that we all will perish (unless your kids cryogenically preserve you). So, with that I ask, what is the best way to die???

Three things that we can undoubtedly count on.  Can anyone fully appreciate how good Mike Krzyzewski really is?? Does anyone really know how to spell Krzyzewski?  This man has quickly become a living basketball legend -- 10 Final Fours, 10-1 in regional finals -- That is almost, just almost, right on par with Wooden's 10 national titles in 12 years.  Well, the Final Four is set. I admit, I threw my bracket out after the second day of the tourney. All that being said, I am proud that I put 3 of the 4 in the Final Four. I had UConn, Oklahoma St., Duke, and Kentucky. That sounds decent, right? However, I had Kentucky winning it all, which was just dumb. Should have known they'd stumble. Actually, they probably would have won it all if I wouldn't have picked them. Seems that the "Strup Curse" strikes again. Damn it. I'm starting to root for the Yankees.  The lines are set for Saturday's games. Money will be flyin' around, people betting their lives on college athletes. It truly is a problem in the US, but I can't really denounce it. God knows I have been willing to put a buck or two on a game before, and if I had any money at all right now, I would be droppin' bills on the Final Four.   My picks? Well, knowing that Oklahoma St is favored by five and UConn is favored by two, I like the Underdogs. Duke as an Underdog is never a good thing. That being said, my final picks are Duke and Oklahoma St. Meaning that if UConn wins by less than two and Oklahoma St. wins by more than 5, I am a winner. We'll just have to wait and see.   Remember my inklings in my first column "Sports, Spirits & High Stakes." Here it is, and I quote "This much I do know. . . Stanford will not win it all. St. Joe's will not win it all. But, someone who is ranked in the top 6 in the final regular season poll will win it all. That should leave you only a few teams to choose from. Good luck. You heard it here first."  Depending on which final poll you look at, this makes me look like a pure genius. Knowing that the RPI is the most-favored final regular season poll, here's the final top 5.  Duke, St. Joes, Oklahoma St., UConn, Kentucky.  Looks like I hit that one on the head, assuming Georgia Tech doesn't ruin it for me. . . After all I have said here, if you're a bettin' man, you know damn well to go put $20 on G-Tech. Everyone else will fall at the hands of the "Strup Curse. . . "
urlLink At least 82 women were secretly videotaped naked  or partly undressed while applying for jobs at a Los Angeles-area Hooters restaurant and changing into the chain's distinctive uniform, police said on Thursday.   Detectives in the Los Angeles suburb of West Covina were interviewing the women, who range in age from 17 to 25, after seizing 180 video files from the personal computer of former Hooters manager Juan Aponte, police spokesman Rudy Lopez said.    "The videos were of the women changing into and out of the Hooters uniform," Lopez said, and were taken while they applied for a job at the restaurant, which is scheduled to open in April, at a trailer on the construction site.   At the interview they were told to change into the uniform of bright orange shorts and a white tank-top bearing the Hooters logo and were surreptitiously videotaped, he said.   "We're taking photographs of the girls in the videotapes and comparing them with the applications and that's who we're trying to contact," Lopez said, adding that while more than 1,200 women had applied it appeared that not all were taped.   "They are appalled," Lopez said of the victims. "They are angry, upset, emotional and had absolutely no knowledge this had taken place."  Not much I can say without getting myself into trouble. This guy really had this whole interview process thing figured out.  Apparently the ladies he interviewed didn't think twice about "modeling" the uniform for their interview.  Makes you wonder. . .
Exercise guru Richard Simmons allegedly slapped a man who made a sarcastic remark about one of his videos, police said.   Simmons, known for his ``Sweatin' to the Oldies'' series of exercise videos set to s
