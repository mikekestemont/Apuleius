Rants and virile are not for me.  I'm done.  No more. Kaputski.  All gone.  From now on I'm going to post content based on what I'm doing and what I know. The internet is no place to work out my angst and misguided journalistic sentament, no matter how sincere or 4th form English in style.  There will be no more heated exchanges between either of my opinions.  Thankyou.
Hey!  My profile says I was born in the year of the sheep...?  I'm offended!  Why didn't I know this before now?  Shouldn't this be on my drivers license or something?  Why isn't it something cool like a penguin or a dragon?  This really smarts.
I've been thinking for a while that the internet lacks any substance so to add to the problem and thereby prove my point I've created a blog for myself.  This is my contribution to the HTML.asp.PHP collage of destruction we call the web.  Bill Gates said the internet was a passing fad and I agreed with him back then like I do right now.  My Blue-WAP 802.11m super-G enabled knifeset  I bought on  urlLink E-bay  is cutting edge but this  urlLink Google  enabled HTML stuff has a limited lifespan in my opinion.  Some good news is that I've decided to invest in a scheme I've had a tip off about. This scheme seems like a guaranteed  winner.  I feel this time I'm going to get lucky - not like all those other times.  I'll still make an effort to update this blog even after I cash in on my imminent  urlLink Nigerian  fortune.  Things I'll be posting include links to sites I find interesting.  Rants on politics, bogus-philosophy and numerous statements of “fact” that are weighted with opinion but not necessarily true and or relevant.  This is my electronic ejection seat for musings and the like.  It's also a darn convenient way to stay in touch with lots of folks with out clogging up your tidy inboxes.
urlLink    Live those gothic style buildings that make the skyline so fascinating. Nice fountain too. I think this was Union Square from memory?
urlLink    The WTC site.  Morbid really.  19,000 body parts later and a really big hole.
urlLink    Historic St Pauls backing onto the WTC site.  St Pauls looked after many of the rescue workers after 9/11 and houses a memorial and interesting gallery.  Also has a old seat that George Washington used to sit on.  Nice.
Last night I caught up with my friend Kellie!  An unexpected piece of good fortune.  Kelly is working at a nice restaurant in Brooklyn.  Wait staff get paid in tips only but it can be an excellent way to make a living depending on the clientele.  We watched Fahrenheit 9/11 in Times Square then caught the subway to Brooklyn where I had a home cooked dinner, drank too much beer and talked into the wee small hours.  Funny how comfy couches can be when you’re wasted.  Unfortunately this heat does not lend itself to sleep and the Kellies building swayed in a disconcerting fashion with each subway train as it passed in the night.    Brooklyn is grimier than the maintained cityscape of midtown Manhattan.  Glad I saw a real apartment though and savored the new surroundings.  – I’m feeling like I’ve seen a good portion of the city now but there is soo much I still haven’t seen - I’ll have to come back I think.  This afternoon I’m meeting Mims, Julia and James.  I’m getting a car organized and will do battle with a Laundromat!  Having an admin day and I hope time for a sleep.    Will post some more NY photos but my next update will be from the road I hope.  Not looking forward to negotiating NY streets in a rental car but if it doesn’t kill you then it must be good for you, or so they say.
urlLink    The financial district is crammed together in a tight space.
urlLink    NYSE on Exchange Street.

27th August. New York    To exist in New York one must have thick skin, millions of dollars or preferably both. This town is expensive and money certainly oils the wheels to make life more convenient if not simply accessible. Quality of life without a stack of money appears to be a tough existence eeked out by making life easier for folks higher up the salary food chain. The entrepreneurial spirit is incredible.  Homelessness exists although not to the scale I was expecting. I haven’t seen Harlem yet and have stayed close to central Mid-town with a few ventures to the financial district in downtown.    The sheer size of this place is staggering. I’m resigned to the fact that I’m only going to see 0.1% of what I should. I’m making an effort to get about when I can but the humidity is oppressive. Tomorrow is museum day where I’ll get to the Metro and the Guggenheim. Thursday I’ll try to get to the Intrepid and see a bit of Greenwich village.    Learning to use the subway was no small achievement – bar the incident where I ended up in Brooklyn by accident! One must be care not to catch a train in the wrong direction.    Central Park is an amazing oasis in the craziness. New Yorkers are fiercely proud of the park and it’s beautifully maintained. The park is an enormous collection of lakes, mini forests and walkways. It even has a mini-zoo. The park is in constant use by walkers, joggers, cruising gays and those infernal cyclists who deem it necessary to wear full road kit to blast around the park during their lunch breaks.    Such apparent wealth is stunning to see – it’s readily on display. There are enormous stretched limos, private helicopters ferrying corporate folk about and the odd car truck with it’s delivery of latest model Lamborghinis. Every skyscraper, especially the older ones have a unique charm and add to the flavor of their district. My personal favorite is the Chrysler building lit by night – it’s beautiful. My favorite modern structure w
