I have just realised the implication of publishing my personal musical tastes to the whole world. My reputation will be  ruined.   And now my ex is online! Whoopidoo. It's not his fault I find him immensely irritating... in fact, he's not even irritating, it's just that he's a little... slow. He's nice and all, but I don't think he was in the queue when they were handing out conversation skills, and right at the front when they were handing out free copies of "How To Be Completely and Utterly Irrelevant" by I. A. M. Pointless. For example, I'm telling him about my weekend (He asked, before you have me down as a self obsessed little girl) and what does he say?  "Was the film good?" "Ah right, cool" "So not such a good weekend then, eh? lol"  Nooo! Nothing so witty! I got:  "Spurs are wearing an all purple kit."  Why the  FUCK  do I need to know this? And how in hell is it in any way relevant to Calendar Girls? There's another puzzle for you. I say "Erm..ok.." and does he respond/apologise? Nooo! He starts telling me about some girl he met the other day. Well, at least there might be a link there... there are women in Calendar Girls?  Good Grief.  Desperate to get to the show Ceff x   # I go up, I come down, and I'm emptier inside... tell me, what is this thing that I feel like I'm missing? And why can't I let it go?#
Well, after a long and in-depth discussion of the merits of RX Bandits with Vez (Hey Vez!!), I have come to the conclusion that although The Resignation might be a very good album, it is not for the people who are expecting more of the same ska/reggae vibes that were on Progress. Although Sell You Beautiful is an AMAZING song, it is neither ska nor reggae, and as I bought the album expecting this, I was disappointed, as, I would imagine, all the other people buying this album expecting ska/reggae were. RX Bandits have definitely taken a new direction with this album, I'm just not sure whether I like it or not. Fair play to them for recording it live and all, but a lot of it still sounds very self-indulgent to me. Bring back the Ska!  See you at the show Ceff x
Arrrggggghhh Blergh it won't let me publish new posts! I am desperately trying to think of something hilariously interesting today, but it is not occuring. I wish fun things happened to me.  How about a puzzle? That sounds mighty fun! Ha. Ha. Try and work this one out:  My current playlist on the  GENIUS  invention that is Windows Media Player 9 consists of:  1. Stacie Orrico- There's Gotta Be (More To Life) 2. Beyonce Knowles feat. Sean Paul- Baby Boy 3. Muse- Our Time Is Running Out 4. Muse- Apocalypse Please 5. Muse- TSP 6. Starsailor- Poor Misguided Fool 7. Starsailor- Alcoholic 8. Starsailor- Lullaby 9. Lostprophets- Burn Burn  (This song fucking RULES I command you all to download it from www.dragonninja.com IMMEDIATELY)  10. Taking Back Sunday- Ghost Man On Third 11. Taking Back Sunday- Heart On Her Sweater 12. Taking Back Sunday- You Know How I Do 13. Taking Back Sunday- Lost And Found 14. Taking Back Sunday- You're So Last Summer  (containing the soon-to-be-classic lyric:  And with my one last gasping breath I'd apologise... for bleeding on your shirt )   Ha! Work that one out!  See you at the show (Next one: LOSTPROPHETS BABY! IAN WATKINS IN THE (damn hot) FLESH!) Ceff x
Musical Recommendation!!   I strongly recommend  Senses Fail . They are soooo cool!  Mp3.com defines them as Emo, but I don't like that word because it has no real definition. I'm sure I can make one up though... but it's really hard cos Emo ranges from Dashboard Confessional to Taking Back Sunday and those bands are really different...why am I whining about this??  Anyway Senses Fail are really good, they have an EP out on Drive Thru, go buy it they rule.  Don't buy: The Resignation by Rx Bandits if you like Ska. Biiiig disappointment. There are some moments of sheer brilliance (Pal-Treaux) which then irritatingly descend into self indulgent guitar scraping. Boo Hiss to them.  See you at the show Ceff x
Wahey! Look at me, Blogging away.  Welcome! To the (probably less interesting than it sounds) Blog of Ceff. I'll be including jokes, hilarious stories along with my usual dose on cynicism on all things male. Don't get me wrong, men are fab (Mmmm... Men ;o)), but I also happen to believe that they are all mean, mean people who keep their brains in their trousers and never change one bit. I would go into details about how I came to this conclusion, but I don't feel like it today. Maybe another time when i'm feeling much more self-pitying.  So! Onto today's random ramblings... 1. For the first time EVER I didn't want to go to English today. It was such a horrible feeling! I felt so guilty... I went, obviously, being the good, studious type, but the passion wasn't there. Gutted. Mind you, I didn't really want to be in school at all today, I would have much rather just stayed at home and thought about...  2. MEN. Well, first things first...GAZ. It's all very confusing. I doubt he really remembers me that well, but because I know ABSOLUTELY NO MEN, I remember the few that I have the privelege to meet in great detail. So- texted him on Sat, invited him out with us on Thurs, but alas, no reply. Will text again tomorrow, with the approval of Liz, who seems surprisingly encouraging about the whole situation- suggesting I went with him to the VALENTINE'S DANCE! Good. Grief! It's all very confusing.  So, that is the current situation... as soon as more interesting things come up that are fun to read and play around with, I will add and stuff, cos this is all very exciting...  I should do something p
