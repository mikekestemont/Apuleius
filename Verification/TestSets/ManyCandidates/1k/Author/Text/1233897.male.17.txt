So I spent today playing with stuff, and the fruit of my labor is  urlLink here . That's right, I made a new blog, but this one is special, cause I'm hosting it myself :)  Yes, MovableType (a blog making engine) is now installed on my linux box, and so is my blog :-D  Sometime soon, when I get a PCI sound card, I'm going to be transplanting computers around. So I'm *hoping* that all my movable type stuff doesn't get deleted, but if it does, I haven't messed with it that much, so it's all good.
Taken from  urlLink This Blog  (the Wireless Blog of Jason Shellen, employee of Google).
urlLink This woman  posted "what she wants in a man" on her blog... I find the most recent update to the list quite funny (keep in mind, I haven't read the rest of the blog):   "Part XII  I want a big geek.  I don't necessarily mean a computer geek, although those are fun, and it's amusing to think that saying something like, "but I couldn't, because the file extension was .php! hahaha!" is a turnon.  But I like smart guys, I like men who have a clear interest in something, and I really, really like people who have passions - in other words, geeks.  Particularly ones who babble on like crazy about the thing they're into, and then realize they're doing it, laugh about it, and then maybe accidentally do it some more, realize it again, and then talk about something else. Awfully cute."   Links to the rest of the list (I find it quite entertaining):  urlLink Part I  |  urlLink Part II  |  urlLink Part III  |  urlLink Part IV  |  urlLink Part V  |  urlLink Part VIish  |  urlLink Part VII  |  urlLink Part VIII  |  urlLink Part IX  |  urlLink Part X  |  urlLink Part XI   Yes, this lady puts a lot of thought into all of these... hehe
Ever notice how all good Operas are in Italian?
i’ve totally been undedicated to God lately. the thing i love most in the world, and i can’t even chase after it. i sure can chase after everything else materialistic and worldy. as ecclesiastes says, “a striving after the wind.” my whole life this week has been just that. and for the most part, many of the weeks before that.   - Kevin's Blog    I think it's so easy for us to fall into the path of materialism. Holding the posessions we have in such high honor, rather than understanding that they're not that important, they're things God has blessed us with. I've noticed in my life I tend to do this a bit, but not really that much. I'm pretty content with what I have, I think it comes from not really having that much. Sure, there are things that I would like, but really I'm content with what I have and I don't try to get them very much, and if I do and they're taken away, I'm upset for a bit but get over it (IE: Guitar that I don't get back till next month). However I notice just how much Americans as a whole are materialistic. Wealth and levels of achievement really all depend on how much you have, what you have, and how much it's "worth" (how you can put a worth on things that aren't important is beyond me). Americans seem to think that the way to happiness is through things... that's why if you notice, when Americans go overseas they try to give the people things in hopes that it will make them happier.  Just something I'm pondering.
Well, I had an interesting Valentine's Day... I didn't really do anything that you would identify as a normal V-Day activity. I woke up early... wrote a poem... was written a poem... and then went out with Brady. No, not in some wrong sense.  Brady came and picked me up around 2:30pm... I wasn't sure of what to wear... well, actually I had just gotten out of the shower a bit earlier and didn't have a shirt on yet. I don't think it's anything Brady hasn't seen, so whatever.  ANYway... we had decided the night before we were going to get a new love interest for him, on a limited budget... the answer was unanimous. He needed a new computer. So, we first went to CompUSA to look at parts... mostly cases and power supplies, but we priced other things as well and decided that Fry's would be a bit cheaper for the rest. So we got a pretty nice case, with blue LED lit collums and a nicely lit power supply as well. Then off to Fry's we headed.  Man... it was raining hard when we got there.  So, we went in and figured out where in the store to get what we wanted, then got the help we needed (they have to make an order thing for it)... so we were talking to the guy and told him we wanted 512 MB of ram (and the kind that allowed for the full 800mHz system bus)..... he started a list of ram on the computer screen... and it looked to us like he was trying to somehow swindle us out of hundreds... but that was explained and yeah... it all worked out. We were about to go up and pay when Brady realized he didn't have the checkbook for the account we were planning to get the stuff on... but it all worked out in the end. So, we got the board in one trip (and oh were we happy), then the processor and ram after a short lunch at McDonald's.  Then we went back to Brady's, for three and a half hours of installation. Oh joy... I live for that stuff, so of course I did it. So, we got in the board, ram, power supply, stickers, drives, and other random cool stuff, and flipped on the switch, and after a little work, it all turned on and looks really cool, and works really well.  So, Brady n
