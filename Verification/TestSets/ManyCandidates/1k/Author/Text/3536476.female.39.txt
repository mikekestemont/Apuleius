Early-to-mid Spring (mid-April to mid-May) is always the prettiest time in my garden, with all the bulbs and irises and azaleas blooming, but now, in late-Spring-early-summer (mid June), the garden is in its second flush and there's lots blooming today.    My Vitex agnus-castus (Chaste tree) is blooming beautifully, and my Hydrangeas ('Nikko Blue') continue to bloom in all their sky-blue glory.  Daylilies are opening all over the place, and my Monarda (Bee Balm) is looking great.  Additionally, there are Echinacea (Purple Cone Flower) and Rudbeckia (Black-eyed Susans) looking great in my "sun bed".    I also planted a new Canna ('Red Fortuity') in my sun bed to add some nice color in the middle with the dark red foliage as well as the red blooms.  What I didn't notice until after I planted it and read the tag was that it only grows to a maximum height of 30 inches, and I really needed a taller (~ 4 feet) Canna in the middle of that bed.  So, I will most likely move this small guy to the edge, and get another, taller one in there, if I can find one locally (or perhaps buy one off the internet).  In any case, it's blooming today, and I must admit that I didn't used to be a fan of red  anything  in my garden, but this Canna has a really pretty colored bloom -- a blue-ish, rather than orange-ish, red.  I've also added a purple sand cherry (Prunus cistena) in the middle, and planted three purple fountain grasses (Pennisetum setaceum 'Rubrum') in various spots of that same bed, again to add more punches of color, so that when nothing is blooming during the heat of summer, the bed won't look like such a weedy unkempt mess.  Lots to do tomorrow, and alas, none of it is gardening related.  I have several errands to run, in addition to visiting mom & dad for Father's Day.  I also need to do laundry and pack, as I am now back on the road again for what looks like most of the summer.  At least this time I'm going North (to New England) for the project, but that didn't help me this past week -- it ended up taking 14 hours to get home on Thursday, what with all the travel delays due to thunderstorms in the Northeast.  Spent two hours sitting on the runway in Hartford, and then six hours waiting at the gate for our plane to arrive in Philly.  Ahhh... the life of a consultant.  Thank God I had my DVD's with me -- they saved my sanity.  Right now I'm in the midst of PBS' "Forsyte Saga" and am really enjoying it.  I'm dying to watch the last two episodes, but don't have any more DVD's to take with me for next week's travel, so am trying to make do with  !#$%^&*  that's on tv this weekend.  I may just have to  up  my Netflix membership after all, so that I won't run out of movies on the weekends!    Okay, enough blathering.  If all goes well and I find a pocket of time tomorrow, I'll upload my latest gardening pictures that I took today.  (I'd do it tonight, but the camera is charging).
Well, I had a mildly scary thing happen to this blog the other day.  I was editing the template, and went to preview the edits, and the preview page hung, so I closed it and when I went back to editing the template, most of the HTML code was gone except the first few lines.  So, after the blog was published again, it was essentially blank, except for the ad at the top and the green background.  I sent a couple of "Help!" emails to Blogger tech support, hoping they could help me figure out how to find my lost code, but got absolutely no response, so decided to just re-select the same template from the choices offered, knowing that all my edits would be gone.  (They were probably gone forever, anyway).   So, now I'm back in  blogness , but I need to add back the Links for the side panel that I had added to my edited template, which means I need to actually  remember  what those links were, and find their URL's again.  This then led me to an  attempt  at organizing my gardening favorites in MSIE, which is not as easy as it could be -- I think this is definitely something that Microsoft could improve on in their next version of Internet Explorer -- they need to make a click-and-drag option, and the ability to select multiple links to drag into a sub-folder, much like how one can organize files in Windows Explorer.  Anyway, so, in my effort to organize my gardening links into sub-folders, as well as get rid of old, dead links, I have done a lot of surfing on gardening websites in the last two days.    Which leads me to the subject of this post --  What Gardeners Want .  As I surfed gardening cyberspace, I stumbled upon a website for a botanical reference library or master gardening website, (I didn't save the URL and forget which site it was now), but which had a list I thought was interesting enough to save to a text file.  They describe their list as  "What Gardeners Want: What information do gardeners seek? Our reference logs reflect their most common concerns".    Basically, it's a list of the main categories of reference questions that the group receives from gardeners who call, email, or come in looking for information.  I thought it would be a good list for me to have, in order to find and post what I consider the best internet resources for each of those needs.  Here is the list of information that the typical gardener seeks for their most common gardening concerns:  1)   Diagnostic   — something is wrong with a plant. Need to identify pests, diseases, environmental situations, and recommend solutions.   2)   Plant identification   — what plant is this?   3)   Right plant, right place   — g
