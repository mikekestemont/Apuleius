Dear Journal,        Right now my cousins, Bella and Julian are over, Bella is 5 and Julian is 2. We've played buried treasure about 5 times in a row. And I'm really tierd of it. Oh yeah, and when we were playing hide-and-go-seek, I was hiding in the shower, and someone walked in to go to the bathroom while I was still in the shower. I almost decided to go out, but then I would be a perv because their pants were probably already down. So I stayed in the shower, almost laughing at all of the farting noises, and almost barfing because it smelled like serious shit. My god, I'm never hiding in a shower ever again. NEVER. Right now I'm listening to Greenday, and the guy whos singing sounds hot. If  sounds  hot, think about how he looks... wow. One thing I hate about AIM, is when people put up an away message that says "I am away from my computer right now". Can you TRY to make a creative one? It's not too hard, heres one of mine  The average person goes to the bathroom about 6 times per day.... this is one of those times.  Creative enough. I gotta go now, do something more important, actually thats just an excuse to go away, since I'm to lazy to write more. See yous lata.  -Sierra
Dear Journal,          I was putting up my interests on this journal, and I think I wrote a lot for music, but then when I was finished, I viewed my blog, and only half of it is there. It really pisses me off, damit! I look really close minded, when I actually have like 10 other bands that I like, and are different types of music. HUZZUH! My day will probably be incredibly boring again, because everyone is gone including TV Hannah, my parents, and James, my older brother. They are all at a garage sale, selling shit. I am listening to the old Madonna right now, the song is Material Girl. I have to go and waste my pathetic life.  -Sierra
Listen to this song BY Garbage:      You look so fine    I want to break your heart    And give you mine   You're taking me over    It's so insane    You've got me tethered and chained   I hear your name   And I'm falling over   I'm not like all the other girls    I can't take it like the other girls    I won't share it like the other girls    That you used to know   You look so fine    Knocked down    Cried out    Been down just to find out    I'm through living for you    I'm open wide    I want to take you home    We're wasting time    You're the only one for me    You look so fine    I'm like the desert tonight    Leave her behind    If you want to show me    I'm not like all the other girls    I won't take it like the other girls    I won't fake it like the other girls    That you used to know   You're taking me over    Over and over    I'm falling over    Over and over    Drown in me one more time   Hide inside me tonight   Do what you want to do   Just pretend happy end   Let me know let it show   Ending with letting go X3   Let's pretend happy end X4
Dear Journal,          All you have to do is click on the title "Hendrix" and it'll lead you to the picture of Hot Hendrix. Lately I've been listening to him, ans he is really good! I was reading someones profile, and it said "so and so's magazine top 100 guitarists" and Jimi wasn't one of them! Comon, so what if he's a druggie, half of them already are! I gotsta go now, but I hope you like my new template thing, the bamboo is good.  -Sierra
Dear "Journal",   Right now I'm listening to the B-52's and their song "Love Shack". It's a pretty good song. I should be getting school supplies today, or tomorrow, which isn't a good thing. Because that means school is coming soon, and what kind of freak wants that? OK, I must be a freak, because it isn't that bad, until they sign a "major" assignment. What happens if we don't do it? It's just middle school, do we  need  to get good grades, will it matter to our college people. I don't really think so, isn't it just high school that matters? I guess I'm pretty stupid if I got those wrong. Right now I'm eating lucky charms, a resonably good cereal. Oh yeah, Hannah is watching TV too! I knew she would be. I think Hannah could be named the first or second most annoying sister in the world, and no one would complain, but her. She is a complainer, zats for sure. I gotta go now, do some illagal things.  -Sierra
Dear Journal,  Today Olivia and I went swimming again, and DID get tans, except hers is more than mine, because I kept going in to go on the swingy rope. I know, excuses, excuses. But it is goldenish, just like this color,  right here . Sexy, I know. After we went shwimmin', we went back to her house, zen went to Impulse, and got two movies. We only ended up watching one, "Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure", which is incredibly stupid, but good. I don't feel like writing much anymore, so I will be going now. Shee ya.  -Sierra
Dear Journal,  Today around 2:30, Olivia went home from our little sleepover. We went to Hollywood and got the movie "The Perfect Score", which ended up being comptely stupid with a horrible ending. When we finished watching that, we watched "Free Willy 2", which was incredibly good. I love that movie, I don't know why. While watching the movies we ate popcorn and Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream. Olivia ate  New York Chocolate Chunk  while I ate  Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough.  It was goot. I think tomorrow we are going swimmin' at SWCC again so we can get tans. How do they do that, you ask? We swim for a bit, t
