Well there went the whole writing every day plan. I was just so confused with various emotions to know what to say. I still don't know what to say in the aspect that all would be confused.  Lets just say I made the right choice, the one that keeps me in a happy, lasting relationship.   I will write more later, I have to study for finals.
I feel it coming moreso than ever before. I know he is going to want a break, but this time I will not stick around and wait. There is no sensible reason for this. We never get to see eachother, or moreso I never get to see him by his choice. It seems like he loves me when its convenient for him. I hate him so much right now.  Ugh.   -Audrey
Last night was exactly what I needed. Ashley and me, just being us. I worked until 1:00 and went shopping ang other random stuff with my mother, which means I finally got my digital camera! Woot Woot! I am going to crem thinking about it. Then Ashley and I met up around 5:30, chilled here for a while then off to some stores.   WE still had a long as time before we went to our movie so we just cruised 'the strip.' haha yeah. Then we saw Kyle and Jordan and they were racing us and I lost, damn stick shift. Then trying to regain my car's reputation at the next stop light I attempted to kick their ass. However, when I jumped over into the next lane because the car in front of me was going very slow, I didn't see that car, then almost got me and Ashley killed. I did however keep us alive, we only drove away with being flipped off.   Then we saw Mean Girls. Good movie, a little extreme however. Then we came back to my house, goofed around with our cameras. She has me making cow and sheep noises recorded. Haha amusing times. But we were laughing so hard my cheeks almost still hurts. :)   We fell asleep around 11:30-11:45  and I woke up at 9:30. She was already awake getting ready for church. We then realized it was raining, so I crawled out of bed and drove her there so she wouldn't have to walk. What a nice friend am I hey?  I am up much earlier than I would like to be, I wish I would have slept until like noon at least. lol. Well I guess thats it for now.
Things have been so-so lately. I am extremely tired, this is completely my fault though because I didn't have to stay at Adam's until 1:30 when I knew I had to be awake at 7:00 for work at 9:00. Ugh. I didn't go to sleep until about 2:30 and I woke up at 7:00. Lovely lack of sleep I would say.   Today I am supposed to be doing something with Ashley. I'm going to call her in a few minutes, I really wanna go to the movies, so we shall see what happens.  Ugh I am so tired, and this is all after I slept at Adam's for 3 hours. He had promised his brother he would play a game with him online before I had gotten there, so at 10:00, they finally started playing it and since I was so tired and had nothing else to do, I fell asleep. Then at about 1:30 I feel someone on top of me (gently laying, not sexual) and I wake up to see my Adam. Then I laid around with him for a while, and I could hardly keep my eyes open so I decided it was best to go home. He offered to follow me, but I said I was ok.   Damn period happening every month on our anniversary. But I don't know, he seemed very much less affectionate because of the fact that we couldn't have sex. I hope that our relationship isn't just sex to him, because that would kill me. Sex can be an important part, but not the entire thing, and definetly not the MOST important part.   I am beginning to think that all the plans for this summer, his special proposal, his already purchasing a ring and making payments on it, the whole theory of borrowing his mom's boyfriends pontoon, or renting an RV, none of it is going to happen.   I am not holding my breath. I love Adam dearly, I just think he's a lot of talk.
Today was long and tiring. I spent the day at school feeling and looking fat. I did enjoy some classes, but sitting in french on my very last day of school with my best friend ever was a little difficult. I cried almost all the way through my next class.   Then I came home and slept for about two hours. I miss Adam so much. He has been spending a lot of time with Paul lately. I don't like the idea of that much because Paul is a major pot head now. Adam has quit all of that, I don't want him  pressured. And he obviously was on Tuesday night when he was so drunk he doesn't remember getting high.   I want to see him so bad. I just called him and he and Paul are going to the Casino. They were actually on their way out the door when I called. Hmm. I want to cry I miss him so much.   Well my tummy hurts from sleeping and I need some food in my stomach.
Yesterday was a pretty bad day in the life of Audrey. I was very upset by a few things, including that of my soon-to-be fiancee calling me by his ex-girlfriend's name. Oh well, I guess we talked about it and he did repetatively aplogize. So all is (almost) well in the land of Adam and Audrey.   I had to give my communitcation skills speech today. I hate public speaking, but it went quite well. Part of the speech c
