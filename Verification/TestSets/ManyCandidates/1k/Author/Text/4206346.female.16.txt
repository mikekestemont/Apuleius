Amazingly better than you'd think. The incense, that is. John's almost done gutting his room. Removing his entire existence from the household. It's really rather depressing. I came home from work today to find a pile of stuff on my bed that he had borrowed over the years. Yoga books, green nail polish, and this lovely incense were among them. I just lit some... it's almost nauseating if it weren't for the headache it gives you. But it's a good headache... if that makes any sense at all.  This incense is making me dumber. That explains a lot about John... considering he used about 10 sticks of it. But that was back in his pot days.  Haha. Back.  I joined Girl Scouts. I amaze myself sometimes. But hey, we get to go to Europe next summer, so that's pretty cool.  Hopefully I can go visit David over winter break. That'd be so tight.  And hopefully Alli can still come out to visit me. That really needs to happen.  Peace out.
I hate this. Someday I'll figure it out.
I have hope!! I just remembered that today at work I asked Shawn if he'd be my freshman bitch this year. He said that Owen already called dibs on him, but that will all soon be changed *devilish grin* BUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  There is hope for my junior year of high school! And it comes in the form of SHAWN!
Okay, I'm seriously freaking out right now because it is just hitting me that ALL MY FRIENDS ARE GONE OR WILL BE SOON. NACHO I NEED YOU TO BE HERE  NOW ! Spinach is leaving TODAY. And it is seriously making me so depressed. Soon Johnjohn will be gone, too. There's like my two best friends in Truckee BAM gone. My only consolation is that Stoof has my email and promised to email me ASAP and Lauren offered up her dorm room to me if I ever wanna go down to UNLV to visit my brother. Oh Johnny-poo. If only you knew how much I love you and how much I look up to you and how much I want to be exactly like you. I miss you already!!!! With John and Stefanie gone, I seriously don't know what to do. David is in Washington. My pookie is in Minnesota. COME VISIT ME! I NEED YOU!!!! Nick and Jilly Bean are in Reno.  There's not anyone here in Truckee for me. Sheldon's cool, but we don't really hang out that much. And as glad as I am that Cassie and I are becoming friends again, it's just not the same. Everything feels so forced. Like tonight was cool and all... you coming over like back in the old days. But it just wasn't the same. I almost died when Alex called your cell phone.  I just realized why I dislike Cassie so much. She is everything that I wish my life could be. People call her all the time. She has an endless source of friendships to fall back on. I know that sounds totally bitchy to just have a gazillion friends that aren't all very close, but all the same, I'm jealous. Like Brynn's party tonight. You were invited. ALEX was invited. Was I? No. Wicks was there. He was supposed to call me. Never did. I bet anything that Sheldon was there. Did he call me? No. Stefanie called me earlier to hang out, but when I wasn't there, she took John instead. But now she's gone anyways. So I guess that doesn't really matter too much. Your life is so perfect and all you can do is bitch about it. But I guess there are probably a few people looking at my life that are jealous. I couldn't tell you any, but it's possible that they're out there. Though I doubt it.  I try to be so easy going. Just go with the flow. Do what comes naturally. Don't force anything. (Kinda sounds like good advice for sex, but I apply it to life instead.) I guess we all just have our low points.  GODDAMNIT I JUST WANT TO HAVE A LIFE FOR ONCE AND NOT FEEL SO SORRY FOR MYSELF!  Is it really so much to ask?  So, here I am, on a Saturday night, sitting alone in my room on the verge of tears.  Another fruitful evening in the life of me.
I wish I had a more interesting blog. One that everyone would want to read. And when I say everyone, I mean EVERYONE. Oh woe is me, for I lead a humble, maybe boring life. Plus people love to talk about themselves (hence online journals and blogs), but don't really like to read about other people. Oh well.  On the phone with Nacho. Great times.  OMG YOU HAVE TO WATCH:  urlLink http://www.ebaumsworld.com/schfiftyfive.html  Just go there. Trust me.  WHAT YOU SAY?! Schfifty five! My IQ is schfifty five!  No, it really isn't though. I have no idea what my IQ is. At least 100. Or at least one would hope.  Whoah sorry, I got distracted by THIS:  urlLink http://www.ebaumsworld.com/endofworld.html  Whoever made that website should pay me for advertising it. Haha. I wish.  ANAY-hoo. Ew I squished a bug! I was wondering what that was when I picked it up... I swear I was going to say something.  Oh yah! I finished separating my dreads for the bazillionth time. They're beautiful. But I had to put rubberbands around each one to keep them apart because they were being bad and trying to be conformists. NO DAMNIT! YOU NEED TO LEARN TO BE INDIVIDUALS. Silly bastards.  Jesus I love how I talk about my dreadlocks like they have personalities. Earlier today right after I jacked them off and twist and ripped em, they were chillin to jazz music. And they LOVE the scarf that Spinach gave them. I just hope my mom didn't hear us talking about yesterday. Stoof totally cut the back of Z's neck while giving him a haircut. Let that be a lesson to all not to give people hair cuts w
