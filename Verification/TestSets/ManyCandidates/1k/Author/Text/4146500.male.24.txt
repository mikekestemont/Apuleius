I was on MC during the past four days.   No no, I was not sick or anything.  One of the most important lessons that I learned, having experienced first hand the perils of School and Working Life, is that getting sick and getting an MC, are usually mutually exclusive events.  Case in point: I had this terrible case of stomachache when I was in Primary school, but the doctor just blatantly refused to give me an MC.  Knn.  I hope he lose his license or something.  Time jump to four days ago, to an older and wiser me.  I was feeling lazy, plus I was still pissed at having to work the day before, a Sunday, for goodness’ sake.  So I decided to take a little break.  I ended up with two days’ worth of MCs, which is not a bad deal for twenty odd dollars.  In fact, it was such a good deal, I went to the doc again on Wed, and got another two days’ break.   I know that my colleagues would probably have to work their ass off, and some unfortunate dude may even have to cut short his leave because of me, but who cares huh?  Anyway, I’m in such a good mood, I’ll share with you guys some of my finer tactics in getting MCs:  1)  NEVER go to the company doctor .  They’re paid not to give you adequate MCs.  Bastards, all of them.  2)  Sleep as little as possible the night before , preferably under 5 hours.  With this, you can achieve that ‘I-coughed-so-badly-I-couldn’t-sleep-last-night’ kind of look.  3)  Don’t brush your teeth, wash your face, or comb your hair before the visit .  This helps you achieve that haggard look, which complements Tactic #2.  The doc probably wouldn’t appreciate your bad breath, but who gives a damn about him.  He’s earning shitloads of money from you anyway.  4)  Punctuate every sentence with a cough .  This is also a test to see whether if your doc is genuinely concerned about you.  The one true good doc I met actually poured a cup of warm water for me when I did this, and I felt very guilty after that.  For about a few seconds.  5)  INSIST on two day’s worth of MC .  If need be, say something extreme like you really need the rest, if not you’ll cause a fatal accident or something in your workplace.  You’re paying the bugger for goodness’ sake, and risked the wrath of your boss and colleagues just to bum off, so please do some justice to yourself and milk as much out of it as possible.  There you have it!  Lo and behold, the joy of watching your doctor endorsing your MC is simply priceless.   Finally, a word of caution: Don’t be an ass and say you’ve got food poisoning or something when you really don’t, because the doc will probably proceed to stick some apparatus up your ass for traces of shit.  Trust me, it's painful.  Oh, for some unknown reasons, my colleagues refused to acknowledge my hellos this morning.  Bunch of stuck-ups, that’s what they are really.   I hope they get food poisoning.  Love, Eddy Neo
I was about to indulge in my bottle of Yakult just now, when I noticed something horrible:     MY GOD!! 911!! Could this be a signal by some terrorists?!?!? I’m traumatized.   Anyway, coming back to Yakult… I love that stuff since I was a kid! Not that I could afford it all the time though… my family was really dirt poor. I wonder what makes Japanese stuff so expensive. In fact, the only cheap Japanese thing that I can think of is the Japanese slippers I wear when I go Orchard. And they are actually Made-In-China. Crap. I really should switch to Vitagen, but I hate that overly sweet taste.  The only time I got sick of Yakult (quite literally) was during primary school, when I drank like five bottles of the thing, one after the other. I promptly languished at the school toilet for ages, but let’s not go into details.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I was watching Yi Tian Tu Long Ji last night (okay lah, The Heavenly Sword & The Dragon Sabre), and I was really disgusted because Zhang Wuji is acted by Tommy Su, of all people.  Tommy Su!!! For goodness’ sake, I seriously think he’s a wuss. Anyone still remember Xiao Hu Dui? Hu dei fei ya!  I’m truly traumatized. All my happy memories of watching the earlier version of the show by Tony Leung when I was a kid is now tarnished. I therefore have no idea why I was glued to the TV last night until the show ended. Must be the babes.  Anyway, if you happen to be the boss of some TV station, I seriously think I can be a A-class scriptwriter for period dramas. In fact, here’s one plot in ten simple steps.  1) Hero witnessed his parents getting massacred by Villain when he was a kid. 2) Hero gets pursued by enemies and falls into a ravine. 3) Hero did not die, but instead found a long lost supreme kung fu manual in a cave. 4) Hero did not go insane, despite the fact that he did not have access to proper toilet facilities and aircon. 5) Hero practices the said supreme kung fu, and breaks out of the ravine thanks to his new found skills. 6) Hero, in the mean time, grows up to be a strapping, handsome young man, and falls in love with Sweet Maiden. Sweet Maiden lusts him back too (cue obligatory sex scene). 7) Hero encounters Villain while having char kway teow, and challenges him to a duel. 8) Hero defeats Villain after suddenly comprehending the final secret stroke of his supreme Kung Fu. 9) Hero kills Villain. Bad mistake. Villain turns out to be Sweet Maiden’s long-lost-daddy. 10) Sweet Maiden goes mad with grief. Hero, in remorse, jumps off a ravine.  There you have it! A possible award-winning script, full of lust, revenge and tragedy, just waiting t
