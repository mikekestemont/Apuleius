There's this girl that i like... She may not always know but she's beautiful There's never enough hours in the day I'm always left wanting I'm always left needing more More of her  My mind left spinning prepetually Always She moves me She takes me out of myself and makes me new Effortlessly , flawlessly  When she looks at me i am quieted Tongue tied Unable to do unable to speak My lips longing to touch yours  Will you grant me what i wish for My legs are tired and my tears all gone If i were blind my eyes would still recognize you Every ounce of my being knows you As if we were old spirits akin to each other Or maybe just two sides of the same coin  I would have you in my arms till this shit ended Till society understood conformity and chose not to All though that may never happen.... I've had you in my arms before  Chances are good that you will end up there again  Chances are good Probably won't let go Feeling is noticably real To real to ignore or disregard for fancy  You're great you know that? And if i could have your beauty in my life everyday from now on  If i could sit and talk with you everyday If i could hold you when you were scared or had a bad dream That is something real Real is what i crave What i crave is you...you are perfect  &nbsp;

Verse 1   I see you sitting by the window of your car  You smile  I see you laughing  Out of the corner of my eye   So many things that i've wanted to say  The things I feel  My thoughts of you  I'm going crazy but it's not crazy that I feel   What i woudn't give to stay locked in this moment with you  Beautiful you are so beautiful  Far to beautiful for me   Chorus   This moment is perfect  And I want to stay  Lost in this moment with you  For another day or maybe just an hour or two&nbsp;   Yesterday I had a dream that this could happen  But i never thought that it could be true  Because of your eyes and smile i'm lost  Please don't let me stare too long   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;
As I wait for you to enter my plain of existence My mind wanders Back to the past  When the things i used to do i hadn't thought of And you were just a vision in a surreal dream  It was getting late and I being of a mind that is always evolving came to a thought If this is a true feeling And my mind is not playing tricks  The you are emotion  You are the invisible movement that sets my mind at ease and puts a smile on my face You are emotion  Emotion a force that moves the heart and sets the soul free My soul soars and my mind sits in wonder and excited anticipation What's next?  If this is feeling and you are emotion then this emotion continues to improve You are that which improves me  My focus and my labor Morning thoughts slipping into nightly dreams You are emotion  That fire in my life and that desire to do To become the best for you  To become emotion in your life To move you I am that emotion that you are and you are that emotion in me
Distorted perceptions of reality Loves lost Loves gain Encouraged cannibalism of the mind and heart Documentation of the insane  Projected predjudices Disguised as spiecies validation Incoherant babblings of wise men Unconditonal surrender of morals held true Choosing conformity now and then  Trust eludes Real purposes intended Meaningful foundations laid Scared of the easily offended  Restoration of restitution Favors disguised as blessings
Do you remember springtime... How it brought you back to mind Carried you across fields blooming Your scent your voice..  Can you still see the stars from that night? The ones that I swear I see in your eyes Dancing across the heavens Beautifully being..  The soft gentle caress of the wind Moving it's way across your face as if it were a hand gently touching your cheek Wipping your tears from cold... How I wish that were my hand....  Your favorite song plays gently on the radio.. You slip into melodic exstasy Feeling you move closer and closer into the warmth of my body. Your heartbeat.....your heartbeat  My heart is beating and i've noticed i'm alive Feeling each breath you take Snuggling into the warmth of my arms  Your head pressed against my cheek Your lips still moving with the words of the song  What do I do This moment... This place... It feels... I feel... I do...  Silently ... the words come  As though they had always been there Words meant for your ears for your heart Your soul
My sanity oh God! Give me my sanity. Strip this pain that numbs my heart, And let me indulge in happiness once again.  Rain clouds all it does is rain, Can you stand the rain? Or will it drown you out? Perhaps it will sweep you away.  Wash it all away Every thought Every Memory Every expression of love Of true love  Someone please take away this pain Release me from the limiting hold of emotion Release me from trust and understanding Cut loose the bonds of affection and warmth  My mind still holds tightly But on what reality  When will it all be done Life a parody of death When we live we are alone When we die we are alone  Death while alive causes sorrow Bordering on the suicidal and psychotic
Where can I begin to describe the beauty i see in you Do you know what it's like to capture the uncaptureable?  To put in words what no words can adequately describe. You are a mystery to me  You have all the grace and beauty of a symphonic masterpiece Carefully arranged to compliment every w
