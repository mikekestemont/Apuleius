sorry to those peeps who got hurt, touched badly, attacked and have violent reactions about my last blog..... it is just what i am thinking and those are my thoughts... im really sorry..... =(  forgive me?
this morning i woke up with enthusiasm because it would be rest time after classes. this morning, was kinda actually cool, we laughed a lot during science and THE was not that dreadful. GEM class was unusually enjoyable and cl was not that bad at all, if you dont count copying every book in the bible. but...... when sir (guinto) arrived, he was looking unusually gloomy. he said "class, alam nyo...nde parang masyado pang maaga, alam nyo na ba ung tunkol sa science teacher nyo? ung lilipat cya?" i thought, ok, he is telling us something we already knoe, but.... "kasi, naghahanap cla ng bagong adviser, iniisip ko na baka nde kakayanin ng bagong adviser ang section a kaya nagvolunteer ako, kaya" "siiiiiiiiiirr! wagggggggggggg! noooooooooooooo! *sniffles of some people*" "nde pa namn syur eh" seriously, tears were building up in my eyes (pero syempre, napigil ko pero i was really really sad), why of all teachers he was the one volunteering to go to section a, why was he volunteering in the first place, doesnt he love us? but ap time went by okay, we were left with the feeling of unsureness but we thought "uy, nde naman yun matutuloy eh" english time came by, the dismissal's usual rumble and shoutings of "ano uuwi mo""ano assignments""pano ung projets natin?" anyway, sir arrived with a happy face, so i thought to myself, "yes, nde sya aalis" but, why does he makes me guess wrongly, "uy guys, get ready with your new adviser sa monday ha!" "englisin ka non, englisin mo rin" "sir, bkt ka aalis, mas mahal ka namin kaysa sa kanila!"  ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, our 1st year of high school with a very funny teacher and now, there he goes, saying byebye like the past 2 months never happened, deserting us to sir roldan, no offense sir roldan, leaving us without any going away ceremony, just leaving us....like that. sir please dont go....  sorry kng ung dialouges indi exact at kng maraming typos... ayaw ko na icheck eh   (this is adressed to the other people....asc pa ba kayo? no offense meant....)
i dont know why, but im starting to feel drowsy even at 4 in the afternoon. i dont do anything that is considered work but why do i feel like this.  this is one of those weeks that you would rather not go through. loads of projects were given and the homework is not a joke. you cant finish it in 20 minutes. last year, i am used in getting homework that would take you 10 minutes to accomplish, but this year, it is too much. it is like giving a person who works 24 hours a day another 2 hours to work... do you get me?  anyway, another sad thing is, sir romero our science teacher will leave us and will go to another dept. he even mada a "speech" telling us how happy he is about our attitude towards him. sir, we will surely miss you. especially angge, she enjoys biology because of you and she doesnt want that to go away  another thing that gets me mad and sad, is the way others think of some one in this class. i just want to tell those people that, sure get mad if what he really does is bad but also think of his situation. ok?  we should be one happy family. there should be no wall blocking our communication. i want this year to be very fun. let us all help each other for reaching that goal... shall we?

it is saturday today. another day to relax, enjoy and make use of our time doing nothing. let me tell you about my day.  last night i slept at 10pm and woke up at 7:48 am. i watched the last part of shrek because i fell asleep when i was watching it last night. i noticed that my kuya miko was not in our bed so i thought to myself that he must have classes today. when i was in the scene when the fairy godmother was singing my dad asked me where was mom. i told him that sh is somewhere in the house. then he slept again and i kept on watching annoyed because my dad interrupted me. when the movie was over. i went down to eat some breakfast. i found out that my mom didnt go home last night. so i thought that she slept at tita betchay's (uy sam!) house because she had a party last night. i was right. i ate 4 nuggets for breakfast with rice while i watched studio d(it's your tv). while i was in the middle of sleepover girls (i watch the whole studio d, for fun) mu dad went downstairs into the den and said that my ipod came last night but he can only get it on monday. my dad called tita betchays house and talked with mom. it was a funny conversation. anyway. i went back up coz if i stay with my dad, he will treat me like a maid. request after request after request. i finished watching studio d and then my mind started to wander. i was alone at our house, along with the maids. we played scrabble and some other stuff. i went online and sam e
