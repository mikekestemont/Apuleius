urlLink commercialappeal.com - Memphis, TN: Local :      'Sambo' - Come again? Germantown alderman apologizes if he said that      By Cindy Wolff  Contact  July 24, 2004  It�s not a word you expect to hear in a meeting of government officials talking about a library.  But Tuesday evening, Germantown officials were discussing their book collection and how it should better cater to people who live there.&nbsp;  As the aldermen discussed their library�s holdings, Alderman John Drinnon uttered the word 'Sambo.'   It was unclear whether he meant the controversial book 'The Story of Little Black Sambo,' written in 1899 by Helen Bannerman, or whether his remark was less specific.  Officials at the meeting recall Drinnon making a racially insensitive comment. No one recalls the specific quote, only that 'Sambo' or 'Little Black Sambo' was used."  &nbsp;

urlLink    Boring radio
urlLink Radio Iowa   I read a story the other day about iPods getting real popular because radio listeners want to hear music and not useless banter or commercials. The same can be said for radio news, much of which is boring crap no one cares about (like massive coverage of political conventions).   The conventions are nothing more than staged commercials for the party's. I covered the GOP convention in Houston in 1992. I thought they were staged back then, but it has gotten worse. The only thing worse is staged radio reports.
urlLink USATODAY.com - Woman charged in alleged 9/11 scam :  ROCKFORD, Mich. (AP) � A woman who collected more than $70,000 from the Red Cross after claiming her still-living husband died in the Sept. 11 attacks has been accused of fraud, authorities said.    The scam fell apart when Donna Miller's husband walked in while a detective was interviewing her at home, authorities said.  Miller, 49, of Sparta, was charged Thursday with three felony counts of false pretense and released on $10,000 bond. Besides a possible prison term, she could face restitution costs if convicted.  Kent County Sheriff's Detective Steve Moon said Miller told officials at the American Red Cross September 11 Recovery Program that her husband, Michael, died when the World Trade Center towers collapsed on Sept. 11, 2001.  Donna Miller made the claim during the frantic days following the terrorist attacks and collected eight checks over 10 months, starting in November 2001, Moon said.  Red Cross officials contacted the sheriff's department after she was unable to provide documentation of her husband's death.  Moon said he was questioning Miller at her home about her supposedly dead husband when the man walked in.     There is no indication Michael Miller participated in the scam and he will not be charged, the detective said. "     Really? Where did she say the money was coming from?

What had been a mellow evening at Wente Vineyards, with the crowd even serenading her with 'Happy Birthday' at one point, turned into a rush for the exits by some fans angry by her encore tribute to filmmaker Michael Moore.  'She just had to do it,' one fan steamed as he headed for the parking lot. 'It was good until the end,' another yelled to TV crews waiting outside the concert.  'She's getting out of line; it's ridiculous,' said Cindy Williams of Livermore, as she left during the last song of the evening.  Ronstadt's encore dedication of the song 'Desperado' to Moore, the controversial maker of 'Fahrenheit 9/11' who she described Thursday as 'a great American patriot,' got her booted from a Las Vegas casino Saturday and drew cheers, some boos, and a few 'traitor' yells from the Livermore crowd.  Until that last song, the concert had been an evening of good music and happy fans."

urlLink Personalized Plate Angers Moms    By Kevin Reece&nbsp;  A local man thought it was funny to get a personalized plate that reads: GOT MILF. But the people who got his joke weren't laughing.&nbsp;  SNOHOMISH COUNTY - Michael Syravong has a very fast car and he wanted his Toyota Supra to have a suped up name.  So, on his license plate application he wrote GOT MILF. And he got it.  'Yeah I just thought it sounded funny,' said Syravong. 'Like 'Got Milk' and the term MILF was getting popular so - GOTMILF, I really didn't think about it.'  To be honest, he had thought about it and it had nothing to do with Got Milk.  It had everything to do with lingo from the movie American Pie. It is, in the most delicate of descriptions, a newly coined noun: a lustful term of endearment, he admits, for someone's mom.  'MILF is an attractive mother,' he said.  But in the nearly two years he had the plate on his car at least two mothers didn't find it attractive.  Emails of disgust rolled into the Department of Licensing. The women wrote that they found it offensive and not humorous at all. After months of review the plate was officially canceled.  'Yeah, I was a bit surprised, shocked, that someone w
