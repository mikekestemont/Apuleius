Ya know how no matter how good you have it, you always dream and wish for more?  Well, that is what I was thinking about today.  I woke up this morning and everything seems brighter, happier, more full of life.  For the first ten mins.  Then Grouchy bear Joe woke up, and in came the storm clouds.  I dunno what is with that man and waking up.  But that is beside the point, anyhoo..  So Joe wakes up in a rotten mood.  I even told him, "don't be cranky this mornin" And yet, the storm rumbled underneath.  Joe gets up and gets dressed, and somehow, someway, it ended up in a snappy argument. To which, my day became a rainy dreary day and I crawled back into bed tryin to keep the rain from fallin from my eyes.  Just as Grouchy Bear was about to leave, he comes back in and kisses me like nothing had happened.  But I was just not having any of it.  My mood was rotten and my day only 1/2 hour old, was ruined. So as I lay there in bed, and pout, I thought about how even tho I am much happier in my life at this point, I still have my rainbow dreams and penny wishes.  Why is it that I can't be content with things just as they are? Which brings me to a my topic.  Rainbow dreams and penny wishes, as you may or may not know, rainbow dreams and penny wishes are they things you wish for.  But not the outrageous "I wanna be a supermodel with tons of men swooning over me and have all the money in the world to get anything and anyone I want" type things.  These are penny wishes,  the things you wish for when you toss a penny in a well for. Those small things to make your life just a little better than it is now. So, you ask, what could a 27 year old that is having the best part of her life right now, wish for.  Well... here ya go... My Rainbow dreams, and penny wishes... I wish that I had a life filled with more happiness than sadness. I wish that *I* was the World  to ONE person. I wish that I could have more self confidence. I wish that I was as pretty on the out side as I feel on the inside. I wish that I could be the happy go lucky gal that I used to be. I wish that I could find something that Joe would do with me on a regular basis. I wish that Joe and I could make love more than we argue. I wish that I was sexually attractive. and finally I wish I could be happier.  So there ya have it.  My penny wihes that someday I hope to make come true.  I know that a lot of those wishes are things that eventually I can change and make happen. And some of those things are never gonna happen.  But they are my rainbow dreams and penny wishes.
Well, as I type this Joe, is currantly in the tub with the cat.  I know it sounds bad, but it's not.  It's just time for the cats bath.   While I sat here I began to think, "ya know I wish I was that cat"  Which Prompted me to write this blog...  Here are the reasons why I am jealous of my Cat...  Loki,is a snobby cat.  He only comes to you when HE wants to.  HOWEVER, that doesn't stop almost any human from wanting to pet him.  The harder they try, the more people try to get his attention and affection.  This makes me jealous because when was the last time someone would crawl under the bed, over the desk, and into a box  just to get to touch me?? Secondly, ALL this cats needs are met.  He gets food, water, love, extra treats, and almost any time we go to the store, he gets a new something, anything from a 100 dollar cat litter box, to a 1.00 toy. Last time *I* got something extra from the store, was a necklace and earings because I NEEDED them to go with a dress for a wedding. Not that I'm complaining about the necklace and earings mind you.  But well.. you girls know what I mean.   Third, and this REALLY gets me.  Joe will finally catch the cat and then proceed to spend the next hour and a half loving on him and telling him what a good kitty he is and all that mushy stuff.  Last time *I* got something like that.... *hmmm* well.. it's been a while Prolly about two weeks ago.  Yet the cat gets this treatment everyday.  PFFT!! :P In my next life, I hope to reincarnate as a spoiled rotten house cat!!
HI! And welcome to my blog. You prolly stumbled across this page and are now wondering "when do we get to the good stuff" well before we get there, I have a few warnings I need to put out before I dive in.  First... I don't care who you are or why you are reading my blog.  If I cared, I wouldn't be posting it on my personal webpage, nor on the internet. Second... remember that this is my personal feelings and my personal life. You don't have to agree with me, but respect that this is my blog. Lastly... I'm a girl, and with that, I am entitled and expected to have things like over emotional outbursts, over analyzing, moodiness, bitchiness, and in general losing my mind now and then.  So I beg your forgiveness ahead of time.  NOW......... as they say..... on to the good stuff..  I was born in Charleston, South Carolina, USA. December 4th 1976. As my mother likes to tell me, it snowed that day. And, it has snowed where ever I have lived on that day ever since.  When I was still little, we moved back to Colorado where my mom's family w
