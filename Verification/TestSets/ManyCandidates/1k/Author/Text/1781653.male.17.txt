Wow, i haven't updated in a long time. Maybe it's because i haven't done anything really interesting lately. Well i have been doing some interesting stuff but that's not ment for your ears :P. Anyways, my dad got back from phoenix today. That's always good. Also i got all these new games to play from some of my friends. That's even better. Most of the week i've spent time at friends houses. So maybe that can explain for some of the lacking updates. I went to my friend ryders house and watched Pitch black "Vin Dissel is such a bad ass". Haha and a funny thing, ryder told me that vin dissel has been playing D&D for over 23 years. I think that's just funny, cause ryder plays D&D and now he says that Vin Dissel is now his new role model. Haha great stuff.
This morning i had church as usual, i got to say hi to all my friends as usual, and the usual always came running to give me hugs :). But today, unlike most sundays, after doing childcare with kristan, i had to stay for a meeting. I mean, "I" had to stay for a meeting. Usualy it's just my mom who stays for church meetings but this time i had a meeting of my own to attend to. I had to stay to discuss planning the next 3 months for acolytes and who serves with who. Then we discused the youth ushering schedules and lector schedules. However, this time instead of being just an acoylte, i selflessly voluntiered to be a lector, which means i get to do the 2nd reading sometime in the future during the service. Last time i did that was like 2 years ago. After that there was some talk about a new highschool youth group being formed. Hah. Me and Olivia, the 2 youths in the group that are actually IN highschool, have heard the same thing for the past 3 years. "Oh, we'll be getting a new high school youth group starting!!!" "We're gunna try it again!" "Don't Worry, this time it will work" Hahahaha sure  Oh well. Haha, the funniest thing is that there's this kid at my church, her name is victoria, she's a big fan of buffy the vampire slayer. Heh, we were talking about something related to self defense and then she mentioned that she had like 3 containers of pepper spray. I was like "haha could you give me one? that would be tight" and guess what? Muahahahaha, today i got some peper spray, so dont mess with me or i'll spray you!!! Bitch!!!!!
Today my dad leaves for phoenix arizona for one of his many confences he has this year. This summer has been very productive for him, he's traveled all around the United states more than usual this year. He's been to chicago, las vegas, new york, manucha "a city in oregon", and now he's leaving for phoenix. All these trips have occoured in a 3 month time period. Now i would say that's a lot of traveling. Oh well, hehe my dad felt so guilty not being able to take me on any of these trips that yesterday, me and him went to fred meyers around 10:30 at night and he bought me some Haagan Datz ice cream and some black cherry cream sodas. Awww :). I hope he has a good time in phoenix
Well i got back from registration, every thing seems to be in order, except for the fact i had to wait about an hour to get my locker to work right, our combo wasn't even remotley close to what it actuall was. Oh well, this year my locker is in C-Wing, which is where all the stinky and nasty freshmen hang out, man i swear during 6th period, it stinks like shit in C-Wing, sigh. At least i got registered and i have everything in order, now i have to wait until school ACTUALLY starts.
Huzzah! I got some sleep finaly. Now all i have to do is wait until 12:30 pm, when i get my mom to take me to school for resgistration. The fight outside i guess got resolved, because i haven't heard any more yelling so far today, so that's good. Now i guess i better get some chow before i head out the door.
Well its 11:36 at night, and i cant sleep cause some fucking retards cant stop fighting. Me and my dad were just doing an evening milk run when we come home to some of our neighbors getting into a fist fight. I don't know where the hell they came from but they seem to have moved into the house thats to our left. These two white teenage crackers start fighting about something i don't know what's going on, but pretty soon it errupts into fists flying and words floating across the airwaves into my ears. This went on for like 20 minutes and then some other neighbors decided to come out to see what was going on. It kept going on and on until i was too fucking pissed to hear anymore, so i got my dad to call the cops to come down here. Two cop cars came down and right now they're sorting things out. There better not be anything else going on tonight cause i don't want to listen to any pissing and moaning while i at least try to get some sleep for registration tomorow. I don't care if i misspelled anything in this paragraph. I'm tired, i'm sleepy and i'm going to bed. Leave me alone.
The dreaded day is almost upon us. Registration for school is tomorow :(. Oh well, at least i get to be a junior. Which is great because during assemblys that take place in the gym, freshmen and sophomore never get to see any of the cheerleader's action. But this year, we're part of the junior/senior crowd!!!! w00t! So we get more privilages. Hell, we even get our own prom!!! Hahaha, yeah. Will I e
