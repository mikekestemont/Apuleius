For the first time in the year, I slept at 9.30 pm last night. The weariness had not faded away yet after one long night of sleep. It’s something inside, deep inside. Something that is sick of this world, things around me, something growth tired of everything.  Really hope this feeling would go away very soon before it leads to serious consequences like before. Really hope it does, it’s affecting my normal life, or, should I say, affecting my present “life”. It’s not normal at all.  I’m still searching for myself, deep from within. I had grown detached from this world. Nothing seems to matter to me anymore, TV, jokes and food; things that I would do everyday and like them had become nothing to me, meaningless. I used to love them a lot, I remember, but the passion is gone.  I seem to live in my own world now, with nobody around. Guess it’s because I can’t find myself yet. “I’m” lost in the mist of masking and splitting personalities. Which is the true “I”, I wonder. I really want to find.  I only feel relax when I’m alone at night, feel true when I’m with my drama friends. Even with my clique. I feel lost. I’m not myself with them, with everybody. I wonder why whenever I’m with my drama clique, I feel very true and real, though it sounds ironic. Maybe it is because during my worse time in life, they are the ones there for me, to comfort me. They only know a little but not all, yet they are able to give me support and comfort.  With each passing day, the pain did not pass away but instead it becomes more intense. The pain is killing me. I can feel it engulfing my internal, my heart, and my lungs. My chest aches. I can’t breathe. Why…  The long for that somebody to appear becomes stronger. It’s getting out of control. It is stupid to have this feeling, I know it’s stupid and idiotic, but the feeling and urge is strong. My life is in a complete mess now. I have never thought of writing blog, think it’s meaningless to write such things on the web, but I find comfort and console here. It’s like talking to somebody and expressing my thoughts. Maybe after I have recovered, I might jeer at myself for doing such a thing.  Life is meaningless, yet I’m searching for it. Life is meaningful, yet I’m still searching for it. I’m never living my own life, yet I’m still searching for it. I’m always living my own life, yet I’m searching for it.
Feeling rather depressed lately. This feeling come back every now and then, just like an old friend. Its return had never failed to strike me hard unexpectedly, like being backstabbed. The pain is intense beyond description.  I am a perfectionist who asks for unrealistic idealistic perfections in life, including my family. It is childish yet I grew up with it, thanks to all the myths and fairy tales I was told since young. This idealistic image is shattered as I grew up in my family.  Since young, I’m very jealous and envy of friends around me. They often told me about their Sunday trips to beaches and hawker centers and the birthday presents they received from their dad. I didn’t know why my dad is different. He had never remembered my birthday, had never gotten me a present or initiate to take me out for a trip. I really didn’t really understand. My closest cousin, Meng, shows a great contrast with me. He got everything he wants from my uncle and my uncle would always take Meng out for dinner every Sunday. I admit I was very jealous, even to the extent I hated him, so much that I wish I could be replace him. That was when I was young. Childish and foolish thinking.  As a child, they thought I was ignorant about lots of things. But I did notice quite a lot. I saw how my elder brother, How, came home from school and then locked himself up in his room. As long as my dad is at home, he would be inside his room, even for dinner. I had never seen him talked to dad before. I wondered why then. All I could see then was the certain look in his eyes. I didn’t know what that was. But as I grew older, I recalled and realized it was hatred that I saw in his eyes.  When I was five, I recalled that the only person who can talk comfortably with dad and made him smile is my second brother, Heng. He had his own ways. How would only hide in his room though the two brothers were still as close. Only I was left alone. Soon after, I took over Heng’s role for some reason. Perhaps it was because Heng had grown up. I remembered one day when How threw a chair at me from a distance about 4 metres away, for reason I could not recall. His anger and hatred displayed through his actions on me caught me dumbfounded. As a kid, I couldn’t figure out the reason, but soon I knew why.  The days when I was the apple of my dad’s eyes were good though he still never remember my birthday or got me any presents. But I still sensed his love and care for me. Soon, I realized the concern he had showed began to pour over. His way of showing his love suffocates me. I was like a chess piece under his control. I was not allowed to go out and had to obey everything he said. When he said you should bathe, you have to go, when he said you have to sleep, you have to, without fail. This overwhelming concern made me feel like a walking dead with no mind of my own.  He did that to my mum as well, even worse. He only allowed her to go t
