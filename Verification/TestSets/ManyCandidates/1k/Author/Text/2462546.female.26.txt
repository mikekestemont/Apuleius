What's up with this weather   Yesterday I went out without a coat on and it was warm out. Today it's snowing. I really wish the weather would make up it's mind.   I was reading the newspaper this morning. The babies of 2003 were listed. The most interesting part of that was that it made me feel old. There were a lot of people I know having babies and they are all people who are younger then me. I never thought of myself as getting older. And with only 12 days until my birthday I'm starting to feel it. According to John Tesh ( a radio show Adam listens to) you're not an adult until you've hit 30. So I guess that makes me feel good. lol. He says that years ago you were considered an adult at the age 18. But with the way people are today you don't reach adult hood until your thirty :S I don't know about that. But that's what he says.   Anyways. I better get going I have a lot to do today!  Happy New Year
Merry Christmas!   I hope everyone had a great Christmas. We did. It was so fun to watch Connor get all excited. He loved his gifts and was very careful with all the wrapping paper. It was so funny to watch him tear piece by piece and hand it to someone or put it in the garbage. He wouldn't just throw it on the floor. (he must get that from his dad) Even though he was awake way past his bedtime Christmas Eve, and then really late on Christmas Day he was still such a good boy. We spent our Christmas the way we always do with Christmas Eve at Adam's parents and then Christmas Day with mine. As well as visiting friends.  I wonder what New Years is going to be like with Connor this year. I doubt he'll be able to make it to midnight! We'll see.   Happy Holidays :)
Tomorrow's Christmas Eve   I think this is the first year in my entire life that I have left getting ready for Christmas wait this long. I had my tree up on November 15th, I even started shopping at the beginning of November. And here it is tomorrow being Christmas Eve where we go to celebrate with my husbands family and we're still not ready. Usually I have all the presents wrapped and under the appropriate tree, I have some kind of goodie baked and ready to serve, I did buy the rice crispies and marshmallows, however they are still in the cupboard.  Today is the day my grandparents make their meat pies. That's one my family traditions. Which means by the end of the day I should also be smelling home made bread in the oven. Mmmm I can't wait. The only thing missing is the snow on the ground :(   Have a blessed Christmas!
Christmas Shopping    Have you ever just stood back and watch people as they shop at Christmas time. It's a very sad sight. People are always in a rush and get in eachothers way. Sure you're preoccupied with your thoughts but geesh relax already, it would make things a lot easier and you wouldn't get so frustrated!   I was at Walmart today, and the only thing that bothered me was that they put up these stupid center aisle things full of stuff and that's just leaving no room for people to move. Which creates "road jams" I think I might write a letter to them and suggest they don't do that. LOL think anyone will listen? Doubt it!
White Christmas?    Well I doubt it. It's not suppose to snow much in the next few days, and so far the forecast for Christmas Eve is rain. What a bummer. But you never know, that can all change.
I'm Back :)    Had the computer down for a few days, while we are "renovating" the house. It's been such a mess, I'm glad that it's finally almost finished down here.   KFC VS ZEHRS- Well personally, I prefer zehrs it's not as salty and actually quite tasty. Um yeah. I'm talking about the chicken. lol.   Hormones.... hmmm. I don't know how much I enjoy all these crazy hormones. One minute I can scream at someone and the next mintute I feel like I can just sit there and cry my eyes out. Only 12 more weeks to go! I can hardly wait.   I better get off the computer and go do something. Yes I'm addicted to it. lol.   Bye
Listen...What's that noise? It's called quiet    Connor's gone to my mom's Christmas party. He just called me on the phone. He wanted to tell me he saw Santa, and deer, and buffalo, and foxes, and camels. It's so quiet in the house without him here. I just finished moving some furniture and Christmas presents to make way for my Papa to finish off the floor trim in my bedroom. Finally it's going to be done after 2 years! LOL  Back to work now.
I Feel BLAH    I just can't seem to wake up today. Here it is twenty to two and I'm still in my P.J's. What I really feel like doing is going back to bed. I haven't even done anything today. It was nice to get the mail today and see the child tax benefit come in early, that was a nice surprise. Sometimes our Canadian government isn't all that bad I guess. LOL. Connor's all excited to go to my mom's Christmas party tomorrow at Zooz to see Santa. He'll be estatic when he finds out Santa got him a BIG dump truck! Only problem is where the heck am I going to put it :S Well I guess I'm going to go have my shower now, then maybe a nap.
One month to my birthday!    You'd think that I'd stop counting the days till I am another year older. But really it's no big deal to me. Yesterday was a good day, we visited Adam's mom and dad and had pizza for dinner. U
