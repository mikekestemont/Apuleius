My group members don't know up to what again. Yesterday one by one tell me maybe not coming to class. End up all came except eric. Fed up with them. Heck care abt them. I won't put in too much effort in my BD. No matter how much effort I put in, they wont accept. My introduction, they delete all, used eric's old one. Teacher already said introduction & evaluation of biz is one page Yati go and do 1 and 1/2 page, end up not enough space. Its either her brain and reny's brains got problems.  I told them pearlyn said, webcam childcare centers singapore have. Reny still uses webcam as our main enhanced features. Then powerpoint slides I completed on monday, but Yati asked me to  wait for eric, because need to insert charts. because yesterday I didnt go, she kept rushing me for the powerpoint slides. I very fed up, I just sent the slides to her without the charts and graphs. She want charts and graphs, she can insert it herself.  The report 1st draft, I saw got grammer mistakes and lots of error.  But I kept quiet, last time the UCCD group project I also kept quiet. Dora told them, report grammer must correct. hahaha When I offered to help, they don't appreciate. What for I go and busybody. Yati kept insisting citation I must put in. But how. Eric always not around Eric is doing the list of references.  Everything is with him. Today really moody, not going to talk to them. I hope.
Today woke up late, at around 12 noon plus plus. Then whole body no mood to move, so snail around the house for a while. Watched the Olympics Athens, my eyes were glued to the TV. I am no sports person or exercise person. But instead I am so interested  in the Olympics. Daydreaming away infront of the TV too. *Sigh*  After Financial Management Class, now at efac doing my e-commerce project part A. ....................Headache Don't really know how to go about. I even promised Irfan to collect data on hairsalons' pricing for him. As a favour, gosh even my horoscope for the week advised me to help others. For I might benefit from it all, I don't care about the benefits I am only afraid if I don't help. Grudges might be bear against me. What to do......... Really like an orange in a foodprocessor, chopped up and diced nicely. Really cold in the efac lab, fingers are getting number by the min. Going off soon.
Its late, but I am still in school. Using the free computer lab access. It ends at 11pm. I am suppose to start on my napster ecom report. Still not a word, I copy pasted some points. Hope I can start writing from there. Cough's getting better less aggressive. Getting slimmer too. From 36 inches, to 33 inches. By tomorrow I had to complete my napster report or the online flower shop evaluation. And start on the CA part b report on bad online flower shops........ Means I have to reach school by 1pm. 4 hours should be sufficient, I hope. Haiz got to go. Really have to start on the contests le.
Friday I started coughing slightly, on off slight fever. I thought it would just wear off by itself. Then Saturday, fever, headache, cough, sore throat.  Woke up with bodyaches, still I did not take any medications. I just took some herbal tea and drunk more water. Slept more than usual. Then came Sunday was suppose to meet reena at 1pm at City hall, the night before I took two biogetics, my mom's sore throat medication.  I could hardly swallow any water, because my throat hurts badly. Every few hours I would rinse my mouth with listrine.  One big full bottle, what's left is just 15% in two days. Monday meeting Reena at Tiong Bahru plaza to get back my business development surveys but fever came back.  Really horrible experience, I nearly had the impulse of drinking down the remains of the Listrine to kill germs. haha Just an impulse too bad. It still hurts now.  But I have no time to go to the doctors, due to the multiple deadlines by my two group members. Really headache............... At leasts I was a sleeping beasts from Saturday to Monday, was nearly sleeping 18 hours average.  Monday morning I woke up early, throat still hurts had to force liquid down my throat.  I slept less than 4 hours but I did not feel any tiredness, maybe because of my ample of rest during the holidays. Maybe later will go clementi to buy some off the shelf medications.
After Friday's E-commerce class, Joanna was not around. So was Irfan.... I went to the toilet at Dover MRT, I thought that Edmund and Yinnee won't wait for me, because they normally don't. When I came out of the toilet happily, but saw them there at a corner waiting. My mood swiftly turned heavy. After Yinnee alighted at Clementi, between the journey from Clementi to Jurong East seems a long time. It was embrassing, I and Edmund did not chat. I tried to find a topic to chat with him. Like where does he live, Edmund just reply  Jurong East lor.  He is really a man of a few words. I really never had a decent conversation with him before in my entire 4 years of education in Singapore Polytechnic. I nearly wanted to faint. I kept looking at my watch, praying in my heart MRT faster MRT faster reach Jurong East. I swear during that short journey inbetween was a stand still in time. This is the longest and unbearable MRT journey in my whole damn life.
Yesterday was supposed to go for an interview at British Council at 11am. But I did not sleep well, slept only 3 hours. Bodyaching, mom gave her crappy irritating nagging as usual. Then worst felt feverish, polytechnic school fees payment slip came. Have to make payment on 7th of August. Wow, only 3
