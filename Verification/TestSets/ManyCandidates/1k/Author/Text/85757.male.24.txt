Ok, finally ive done it. my very "own" blog on the world wide web. why? you might ask? well i think it is a better way to vent out my frustrations in life etc rather than doing something stupid. Rest assured this wont be an angst ridden blog by some person facing a difficult time in life, hehe. all those pent up emotions are not really good for you. I am not really good with words, so bear with me while i get the art of blogging right. mean while enjoy the ride...
coffee count: X   I did not get enough coffee today, so i have a bit of bog "block". I was very busy last week and i dont have nothing much to talk about. I just came back from a 3 day course in avillion ( urlLink http://www.avillion.com.my ), pd. The place is nice but I did not have any chance to enjoy it. The keyboard at this cyber cafe really sucks(thespacebarisjammed), I will continue later on my laptop.   coffee count:XXX  God, this is stressfull. I am now in the office trying to finish a presentation that i have to do for the GM. He is visiting the area... I wanted to write about vacation or holidays. I have not had a proper one in such a long time, I am planning one this year. I am hoping to visit one of the islands in the east coast. All this stress is getting to me. I have no time for my own anymore, it seems to be work, work and work.  Well maybe it is my own lack discipline in time management, but i will try to find time. I am now in the midst of doing some background work on where to go. keep looking on the blog for my plan.
coffee count: XX   Life generally sucks, believe me. I am not pessimistic but this is reality. People would say the grass is always greener on the other side, that just means the grass on this side sucks and i would like to go someplace else that is better, being a cow doesnt help either.           So what would you do if life sucks? make lemonade if people throw you lemon, make the best out of it. It is no use being bogged down by life's problem, be it work or personal. Love lost, broken heart? be thankful that you did love someone and you still have a heart to love in the future. Things are not working out the way you planned it? view them as a challenge you can overcome.      It is a sign of a great person if you could climb back after you fall down.
those banner ads are really spot on...
coffee count: XX   Might as well write something while the momentum is there. Since im on the subject (of love and lovers) I have another issue to talk about. Have you ever had feelings, whether love, like or lust about someone, but the person is a total jerk. Well maybe it was my fault, hoping for something that i would not get, but hoping against hope that somehow  things will change.      Why do I do this? why would anyone wanted to do this? being "humiliated" trying to get that someones acceptance. Rejection is a painful thing emotionally. Back to the question, why do you like someone who is a total jerk? Do you see something in that person, that fits everything that you ever looked for in a lover? The strong silent type, the smart intelectual one, successfull in life, athletic jock or your average joe?      I guess when you have found that someone that fits your image of the perfect lover, it is very hard to let go, fearing you might not find another one. You are willing to accept the person even if the person is a jerk. In the end you are the one hurt and probably you would just gave up finding someone. Living in denial...
coffee count: XXX    Its like a month since I have written anything to this blog, I was kept busy and now I have found enough time and stuff to write. I was contemplating on what to write, my mundane life in kuantan or my personal feelings? I have decided that I would just write what ever that crosses my mind, (internet: a journalistic heaven). So here goes.  Do we need a lover? I was a non believer before, all that lovey dovey crap, why get emotionally involved and get your life in a mess? That was the impression that I got from the love life of people around me. I was happily living the swinging single life when i met someone(for those in the know, you can skip this bit). It is a different feeling, being loved and loving someone else. We had to part ways, but I think i will never forget the experience. Quoting Tennyson:    "I hold it true, whate'er befall;     I feel it, when I sorrow most;     'Tis better to have loved and lost Than never to have loved at all"   Suddenly all those love songs starts to mean something to you.   Ever since, I was looking for someone to fill in the void, but it was not easy, in fact it was very hard. I have now resinged to the fact that it is better to let things be and hopefully love will come knocking.  So do we need a lover? I think maybe, but if you cant find one, make sure you have friends with you, never neglect your friends, it is hard to find true friends, standing by you through thick and thin.   god, what ever possessed me to write this stuff?
coffee count: XXXX   I was prompted to write this blog as I saw this person at my workplace that I have been laying my eyes on for more than a year! have you ever had this feeling of being attracted to some one so strong that you just can't stop looking, lusting over? Of course i think that he never n
