:( feeling sad and mad   i'm mad at ryan coz he's not paying me much attention as i want him too. i'm chatting with swanny right now and we're talking about naughty stuff =)
friday! friday! Yesterday, I called my friend from Latvia.  After 3 years of on and off communication I finally talked to her on the phone!  I called her up and it’s so cools when I heard her voice.  We immediately hit it off on the phone, no awkward silence or anything, just like in email and chatroom.  We sometimes think that were soulmates or something coz we usually think the same thing at the same time.  If we had the chance, we would have stayed at the phone for hours, but then poor girls like us can’t make an overseas call that would last for hours.  Maybe we will someday, when and we’re rich and married and happy. Believe it or not, we said exactly the same thing in our email right after we talked on the phone.   There’s something about Fridays…no matter how much work your doing, you just can’t feel it.  Today is a typical busy day for me but I’m not feeling tired yet and it’s almost 5 PM.  Maybe part of it is because I talked to ryan last night before I slept which is why I felt so recharged.  Yah, I finally got the chance to talk to him after like 3 tries.  He said he’s in class studying, his next exam was in an hour.  It’s kinda funny coz he told me ryan is not around and he asked me to leave a message.  I thought I was talking to his brother so I just told him to tell ryan that I called.  Then he asked me all these questions like who I am, where I’m from and why I’m calling.  I got very nervous coz I was thinking why his brother is asking me all these questions, that maybe he doesn’t approve of our relationship or something.  I don’t wanna be rude but I don’t wanna answer his questions too so I just asked him another question like why he wanted to know about my name and stuff.  But he kept on asking me these questions and I answered in the same manner too and asked him why until he finally said “sillo” then I knew it was him.  Sillo is a typo erroe for “silly” and that’s one of the names which he calls me.  We call each other lots of names but it’s funny what kind of names he comes up with.  He calls me choco chip pie, choco ice cream, pecan pie something (can’t remember exactly), honey bunny, sweeti pie or cup cake or whatever that comes to his mind.lol Now, that I think about it, there’s one thing in common about the names – it’s all food! Is he thinking of eating me? Hmmmm…if he meant it in a sensual way it’s turning me on. =)  But there’s one name we seriously and consistently call each other that sometimes it’s like our name now and that’s jan or janu.  “Jan” in urdu means life and “janu” means darling or honey.  Most of the time he calls me “jan” which is also short for janu.    Ryan is such a sweet guy which is why I’m falling in love with him more and more each day (if more is still possible!).  He does things that other guys wouldn’t have imagined doing.  I called him once and he was in school.  I asked for a kiss and he gave me coz he thought I’ll get angry if he doesn’t give me one after I asked for it.*sigh* Same thing happened last night.  As I’ve told you before, he was studying in his classroom for his next exam and he’s whispering the whole time.  It’s kinda funny coz I think he’s trying to hide the fact that he’s acting silly with his gf from his classmates.  I mean he looks like this tough guy but he asks mushy and silly around me.lol  Anyway, I asked him for a kiss (I was trying to find out how strong is my convincing power) and I was so persistent he finally gave me one right in the middle of everybody.  I love him so much when he does things like this, like he just can’t say “no” to me.  He doesn’t have this macho complex like some of the guys have.    Is this how contentment feels like? Ohhh, I feel so blessed!=)
my day is just beginning an yet… I have this middle-aged (40 something I think) officemate and she’s really pissing me off.   She’s asking me these stupid questions again!  Why can’t she just look for the answers herself?! Commonsense is all she needs!  She’s such a lazy b****! It happens not just once but like thousand times in a day! I’m so irritated with her I wanted to yell at her sometimes and tell her “are you stupid or what!”.  But, of course I’ll never do that, I have never been so blatantly rude to anyone esp. to people older than me no matter how irritating they are.  But I lost my temper with her once and answered her in a nasty and that’s practically it.  The worst that I have done is just ignore her even though she’s talking to me coz I don’t wanna lose my temper and blurted something disrespectful.  Besides, I don’t wanna create friction between us or else we’ll never be able to work harmoniously together. So, I had to be patient and try to adjust to her stupidity.       Wait a sec…  Ok, I’m back. I just made a call to ryan but he’s not answering his phone. He’s probably busy studying for his finals.  Anyway, he did send me a sms a while ago so I thought I’d call him.  You know, I really get pissed when I’m making a call and nobody answers my call.  We even had a fight about that when I tried t
