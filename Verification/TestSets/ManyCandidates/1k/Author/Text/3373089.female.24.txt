and   BLUEFREAK  ,ur comments  keep me going..do keep posting them..its really loved
hey  Vardan , thanx a lot for all the encouraging words..it really felt nice..well i was very hesitant to write an online diary..but just like everything else in life,i had decided to give this a try too..its gradually becoming an addiction and hope that before it grips me completely i would be out of it..but so far so good..read your profile and liked the "keep grudges" part of it..well no matter how much one says that they forget and forgive..i dont think they really can..i feel that even they know that they cant...
After speaking to two of my most favorite people in the world yesterday, realization dawned on me. One ingredient that makes our life a complete bliss and relationships Work --- Distance. 	 They said “ keep your distance ,don’t involve yourself too much into any one’s life, be nice to all and not too close to anyone.” That’s the recipe of happiness.Maybe,I was thinking about the same thing, but couldn’t point a finger at the exact solution. One day and two phone calls later, the solution is crystal clear. It seemed as if it had always existed but I couldn’t see it.  Now I realize that I am going through a strategic inflection point, “it is the time in my life, where my fundamental beliefs are about to change” Thank you Mr. Andrew Grover for telling us about this concept.  Well at 24,maybe it’s a little too late but I think when they say “Its never too late to learn”, they are damn right. I have finally learnt it, learn it at this age and learnt it the very hard way. And I am sure that this learning will last me a lifelong.    “A lot of things go unquestioned,  A lot of questions go unanswered,  A few words go unsaid,  A few go unheard,  Some dreams are buried,  Some dreams are born dead,  That’s life !!!”    Read this in a Short Message Service – but I know that it will live with me for the longest part of my life…..what a paradox!!!
As you stand in front of the mirror,you wonder if u like the person you see..    Is the person you see,the same that you always admired? Is the person staring back at you,say the same things she always did? Is life taking its toll on her? Is she gradually losing her own reflection? Is she still having the dreams of a simple happy life? Is she gradually losing her identity and fading in a crowd? Is she still loving herself? Does she still cry, when someone rebukes her? Or has she started moulding into a stone? Does she love someone more than herself? Does she love anyone at all? Will she see herself in the mirror again? The mirror doesn't think so...Does she?
Its going to be three years..three years of being in love..three years of bliss...and trust me ..love does finally free you...free u from the pain.. All my life i had wanted to meet someone..someone who would completely floor me..sweep me off my feet and maybe there would be the bells ringing madly and i would know that he is the one..divine intervention.. but it didnot happen that way..he met me..and quitely took my heart away..and before i could realise that..i knew i was in love..and this love was diferent from the ones that i had felt before..It enveloped me in the sense of fulfillment..of contenment..and i am still recouping.. As the days pass by,i feel that i am growing insane..and i feel it is so very diferent..its intoxicating..and am i enjoying it!! I can just say that.."he completed me"! and now when i sit back and think about the experiences i have had in my life ..I laugh out loud.. After losing the person who meant the world to me in a freak road accident..i had felt that my world would never be the same again.. Now when i think of that person..i can feel that he is smiling form the heaven above..and i am quite sure he is finally happy..just to let him know up there..i still love u ...but maybe now i am not lonely..i have someone who will take care of me all life long..but i miss u a lot too...  this post is dedicated to DS,a person who has given my life a meaning..  AS the lead actor in the movie "the beautiful mind" says,    "you are my reason to live....you are all my reasons"   its just like that..thank you
Hi bluefreak.. well hope u have my reply now..(if not please check the comments section)
I say...   LOVE ALLOWS YOU THREE MISTAKES....... AFTER THE FIRST ONE..YOU FIND A BETTER PERSON.. AFTER THE SECOND ONE..YOU FIND TRUE LOVE.. BUT AFTER THE THIRD ONE..YOU NEVER LOVE AGAIN!!!    Well..I had made two mistakes,now seem to be in "true" love zone..life is like one happy ride..  Unfortunately had felt that twice before..but woke up to realise that in a relationship,the equation of love is not always balanced..But this time I have finally managed to balance the equation!.Its one hell of a job!! :-)  Mr Putin..listening? You dont fall in love once..Its just that,next time, YOU DONT FIND LOVE , LOVE FINDS YOU  !!!
They say Its a dogs world!! How very true..When i had walked into the MBA class for the first time,my father had said,"MBA is a battlefield,to survive and excel,you have to fight". For the first few months I made friends,partied and basically had fun.. Litle did i know that gradully,life would change.. We had not shown our "fangs"..Maybe now we have and its a matter of survival.. The rule is that there are no rules..we just have to play on!!..and thats what i am doing.. They again say..Everything is fair in love and war.. I say,everything unfair is fair in love and war!!! So war is business and business is war.. what am i waiting for..let's get down to business now..
Hi!!! its been quite sometime since my last posting..its been one hell of a w
