A very lengthy and not-easy-to-digest article on  urlLink Open Source as a Paradigm Shift . I'll need a couple more reads to understand his points. It seems to be call to the open source community to look around and be more aware of what they were doing, but my sense in my initial reading is that the future is not so much about open source, but open content, created by the users, for the users. Of course, open source in the backend will be an important factor in bringing about this future.  Most of the software I use (except for Windows and Office) is already open source, or at least free. I'm also using a lot of free Internet services (web hosting, mail, etc). However, we must not forget that behind most of these things there are companies, and companies need money to sustain themselves.  Anyway, as I've said, I need to read the article again. Maybe I'll have a clearer understanding then.
Michael Schrage from MIT's Media Lab wrote this  urlLink interesting article in CIO Magazine . Do IT certifications mean much nowadays? Are they a good indication of how good an IT professional really is? In contrast with this article, check out this  urlLink article calling for more certification  in the IT industry, by one of our local technology leaders.  We don't really need more certification. We need  better  certification. I have both Bachelor and Master in Computer Science. I'm currently not certified in anything (my current job doesn't require them), but when (if) I ever get certified in something, it sure will not be just a piece of paper.
Here's a post to kickstart this site. Time has an article on the  urlLink blogging phenomenon . Why do people write blogs and why do people read blogs? Perhaps they want to keep in touch with their friends. Perhaps it is to vent their frustrations to the world, and who cares if anybody reads them at all? Or to preach their world view. Or perhaps it's simply a good medium for like-minded people to share ideas and discuss current affairs, interesting articles and maybe even other people's blogs. Or maybe it's for people with a hidden agenda, political, commercial, etc. Or maybe it's just plain c00l. Whatever the reason, there's something about blogs that make them so fascinating. You could probably write a whole book on blogs, why they are so popular, what they mean from a sociological and psychological perspective, etc.  What do you think? How do you think this will evolve? Where are we heading? How will people interact with each other in future, either directly or indirectly?
I just read this essay,  urlLink The Other Road Ahead" , written by Paul Graham back in September 2001. Very excellent and relevant, even today, looking back 3 years later. His site has a lot of other interesting  urlLink essays  as well. Comes with Japanese translations (woohoo, I can practice my Japanese ^_^) and RSS feed. I think I'll put him on my reading list.
Bought meself a wireless LAN access point. Was kinda worried about filling up the house with microwaves, but what the heck, I get them at work anyway. It was quite simple to install actually, including setting the encryption keys, and I'm quite happy with the coverage. Now I can be connected in the comfort of my sofa in the living room and not have to be tied to my desk all the time.  Finished reading "The Truth" by Terry Pratchett today. Wonderful book, as with all previous Terry Pratchett novels. This one's about the invention of the newspaper. I've always loved the Discworld stories, amusing, wacky and yet so true to real life.
Okay, just signed up with blogger and got a site on blogspot. Now what do I write? Hmmm......
Just downloaded  urlLink w.bloggar . Maybe it will encourage me to blog more often, heh. :-)
Well, what do you know? For the first time, I engaged in the national pastime....queueing. :-P With Chinese New Year just round the corner, I went down to Chinatown yesterday for the first time in my life to buy the locally famous Lim Chee Guan 'bak kwa' (barbequed sliced pork). No mean feat, for enormously long queues always form the week before the Chinese New Year. Yes, you can buy the sliced pork all year round, but it is a most desired foodstuff during Chinese New Year, and you have to get it within a week from the Chinese New Year, because it doesn't keep its taste well after one week...or so the elders say. It's not the only 'bak kwa' around, but our elders swear that there is no 'bak kwa' better than the decades-old Lim Chee Guan brand.  So you had me, along with hordes of people - the elders, ever loyal to the brand, who had been coming here year after year, and the young who came as a demonstration of their filial piety, queueing up in the wee hours of the morning, before the shop opened, just to buy a couple of kgs of that so oh-hard-to-get sliced pork. Partly because I needed to buy some for my sweetheart's family, and partly because my brother spend 9 hours (yes, 9 hours!) queueing up the night before to get some for his gf's family, and I thought I could do better by coming early in the morning, and perhaps I'd be done by lunch. Well, turns out I was very much mistaken about the effectiveness of my strategy...  Just how long is the queue? The shop opens at 9am. I was there at 8am, and there must be over a hundred people in front of me by then. By the time the shop opens, I dare say it has enough customers already lining up to give them business for the entire day! "-_- How many shops can lay claim to that? I brought a book with me and settled down for the long wait...  There was an old man in the queue with me who chatted with me throughout the d
