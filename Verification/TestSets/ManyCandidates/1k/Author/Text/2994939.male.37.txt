HIGHLIGHTS    e-Business – Asean    urlLink  Piecing together a Chinese software giant    Hong Kong-based chinadotcom, considered a "pioneer of China’s Internet," is reinventing itself as a provider of enterprise software to Chinese manufacturers. The company rose to prominence as a major player in the Chinese Internet portal market, but has now embarked on a series of acquisitions and partnership agreements in the USA, Canada and India to beef up its presence in the enterprise software market. Also on tap: plans to turn the company into a "software outsourcing shop." While most tech analysts are bullish on the company’s prospects, the article points out that chinadotcom "will face plenty of competition" from enterprise software rivals in China such as SAP and Oracle.

According to Sun, Wal-Mart suppliers will be able to load pallets of actual products in their original packaging and "run them through mock-ups of loading docks," enabling them to test whether RFID-tagged products can be read by Wal-Mart systems. Three other tech firms - Nortel Networks, Texas Instruments and i2 - will join Sun Microsystems in the RFID initiative. If all goes according to plan, Sun will open a similar RFID facility in Scotland by the end of the summer.

The company did disclose the exact size of the layoffs, noting only that less than 10% of the workforce would be affected. SCO also noted that the move to shore up financial performance was not the result of pressure applied by BayStar Capital, which earlier threatened to pull its $20 million investment. In its most recent quarter, SCO posted a net loss of $2.25 million on revenue of $11.4 million.

In addition, Sony Connect will offer full album downloads starting at $9.99. Sony - like its competitor Apple iTunes - hopes that its online music service will lead to additional sales of its audio devices. But, as critics point out, the company’s late start in the market may be difficult or impossible to overcome: "They're behind the curve already and they have to play catch-up on two fronts, on selling their audio players and getting people to use their music service. There's roughly three to four million people that have already placed that bet."

The disruptive power of the Internet means, "big companies are again under assault" in a number of very different industries. As during the late 1990s, the Internet is "threatening to force down the prices charged by traditional players, squeeze their margins, and even put some out of business. New technology, new ways of doing business and new approaches to cutting out the middleman mean the old pricing power is collapsing in a series of industries…" Business Week trains its eye on six industries that are about to be disrupted: jewelry, bill payments, telecom, hotels, real estate, and software. While nobody is claiming that this is "1996 redux," the fact remains that the online players that survived the brutal Internet shakeout are stronger, savvier and leaner than their boomtown brethren.
