So, it took some doing but I finally tracked down what they're building at LaSalle and Erwin Rd.  The construction nearest my apartment will be a mixed use area called  urlLink Erwin Terrace , and the construction across LaSalle will be “the Lofts at Lakeview”.  The Lofts are luxury apartments and seem a bit crazy.  Evidently the bizarre bunker-like structure being built is indeed a parking garage—six stories of parking garage!—and the apartment plans include a gourmet commons, theater room and internet café.  A bit hard to picture, and harder yet to price.  (All this courtesy Chamber-of-Commerce  urlLink online records .)  It seems  urlLink Durham  has a surprisingly strong electronic presence, and some of the planning documents (e.g. for my neck of the woods,  urlLink West Durham ) are interesting.  It's nice to get a little insight into how cities are planned.  I'm a fan of this trend toward new urbanism—extensive reliance on mixed use areas, generally complemented by green corridors and public transportation—but it almost always connotes gentrification, in practice.  Anyway, there’s no information yet on who my new neighbors will be.  At least it’s too small for a Walmart.  Ideal would be a corner grocer, a new &amp; used music store, an indy late-night coffee shop, and a decent Thai or Indian place.  Ah, ‘twould be heaven.  I’ve exhausted my investigative abilities, though: I’ll have to wait-and-see on what we actually get.

As I've reorganized the webpage, these comments needed to find a new home.  This gets quite technical and are probably nonsensical with reference to  urlLink this overview .   Those of you who've paid close attention might have noticed that the  urlLink "Harmony and Natural Sounds" paper  has continued to experience sporadic revision. Most recently, it was to admit the Harmonic Series LFACd2 predicts a minor 3rd more consonant than a major 3rd. This is pretty unreasonable, but my sense had been that harmonic series and speech performed fairly similarly overall. To formalize this, I examined all pairwise consonance comparisons reviewed in Malmberg (e.g. "Stumpf reports Fifth > Fourth") and counted the portion agreeing with the various prediction methods in the paper. The papers Malmberg reviewed both overlapped and sometimes contradicted one another, so the percentages I ended up occupying a compressed range (almost all in the 60s). Nonetheless, it was as I suspected:   Speech LFACd2 (equal temperament) performed best, predicted 67.53% of pairwise results reviewed in Malmberg 1918. At justly-intoned intervals it did almost as well, with 66.07%. Of mean peak-normalized spectra, the most analogous method (examining suboctave intervals both directions from peak) performed slighly better at justly-intoned intervals but much worse at equal-tempered. This performance was the best of any peak-normalized spectra.   As for the Harmonic Series LFACd2 predictions, which after all started this whole mess, I found neither a great fit nor disqualification. Using just-intonation, harmonic series LFACd2 matched 65.8% of the claims in Malmberg. It was again quite sensitive to subtle variations in tuning -- switching to equal temperament decimated the consonance prediction at the minor 3rd interval, for example, but dramatically increased the predicted consonance at the minor second. The net consequence reduced the fit to Malmberg, but more generally piqued my skepticism about the method.   This all superficially supports my paper, of course, but I have misgivings about the hypersensitivity of these predictions to subtle (perhaps imperceptible!) differences in tuning.   It is true that during our lives we learn to ignore subtle mistunings.  We know that most humans internalize culturally-variant aspects of musical scales by about 5 years, and perhaps we've all learned to conflate equal temperament with just intoned.  But this would seem to militate against the whole these that these traits are inborn, or natural consequences of our auditory environment.  Alternately, I wonder if I've overfit my data, (I examined only one typical harmonic series), or if the biological basis for harmony is more crudely filtered than I've here assumed.   In the end I suppose the best answers won't come from psychophysics, but from electrophysiology. My suspicion is that these statistics are useful for Bayesian tuning algorithms in the ear (implemented perhaps by outer h
