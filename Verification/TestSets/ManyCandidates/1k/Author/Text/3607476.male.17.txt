omg omg.. today was such a doss at skool.. did like no work at all really.. just mucked around and had a good laugh.. especialy with mik and zan (and sam).. well i dont think he found it funny.. when i poured water in his shoe.. lol.. then he put it on.. was well good.. unfortunately.. i didnt get the whole cup of water in there.. lol.. damn.. well it was a joke anyway.. hope he didnt take it tooooo seriously.. i mean.. i poured half a cup of water on bhaumik.. he didnt seem to mind so much..  apart from that.. chemistry was a doddle... richards is sooooo boring and soooo NOT funny.. told him that by laughing sarcastically in class.. to any of his boring jokes.. yea that showed him..  played footy as lunch as usual.. was cool.. scored a goal woohoo.. even though it was well fluke.. but thats not the point.. anyway.. did some singing with nish too... wasnt anything special..  and had a driving lesson in the evening.. went well.. better then i expected.. having not driven for like psssh 5 weeks.. but heh.. after some asian dude dropped me off.. and his test is like tomorrow.. and boy was he driving bad.. continually saying "i can't see anything".. it wasnt raining that bad.. and he was driving like 10mph.. took me ages to get home.. anyway im off to play some guitar..
damn i cant seem to sing properly in front of people.. like i just now.. alex was playing the guitar.. he played.. can't stop.. whereever you will go and under the bridge.. and every time i couldnt sing the way i normally do.. (normal is good heh).. i dont think i can really put enough emphasis but just standing/sitting still... need to move around and really throw my voice at it.. then it sounds all funky.. hmm maybe ill get used to it.. like sooooooon.. anyway.. off for driving lesson now.. post later..
Woohoo.. last exam was today.. pure maths 2.. i think it went better than i thought.. evne without doing a single bit of revision.. not good enough thou.. prob got like a D but thats not the point.. yea today was cool.. weather was shit thou.. didnt get a chance to play footy.. hmmmm "trying" to get some drums.. but without much luck.. sang a song or two with nish and alex today.. was good.. heard toby too.. his singing is good.. he can sing in tune..sure he can sing but i dont think he has that s
