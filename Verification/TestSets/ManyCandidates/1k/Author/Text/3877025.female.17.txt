YESTERDAY ROCKED HARDCORE.  WELL MY MORNING WAS A WEE BIT HECTIC AND SUCKED BUT BY ABOUT 1 PM THINGS WERE GOING GOOD.  ME AND ANNA HOPPED IN HER CAR AND DROVE TO MARSHALL TO GET APRIL THERE WE MESSED WITH JOSH AND ANNA TOOK 40 PICTURES OF HIM. SPEAKING OF PICTURES I'M TRYING TO WORKING ON PUTTING UP SOME PHOTOGALLERIES SO IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS ANY SUGGESTIONS AT ALL PLEASE HELP ME. BUT ANYWAYS SO THEN WE MADE IT BACK TO MY HOUSE AND JESSI  WAS THERE THEN WE LEFT SOMETIME BETWEEN 3:30 AND 4:00 PM.  WE ATE AT WENDY'S ON THE WAY THERE (MMM... CHEAP CHICKEN NUGGETS) WE GOT TO THE CREEPY CRAWL AT ABOUT 7:10 AND WAITED IN LINE FOR LIKE 20 MINUTES TO GET IN LUCKILY WE BOUGHT TICKETS IN ADVANCE.  WHEN WE GOT IN SCATTERED FALL WAS PLAYING AND THEY WERE PRETTY GOOD THEIR SINGER WAS REALLY HOT AND LOOKS A LOT LIKE DAVEY HAVOK BACK WHEN HE HAD THE WHOLE DEVIL LOCK HAIRCUT THING GOING AND THEIR DRUMMER LOOKED LIKE NAPOLEON DYNAMITE.  AFTER THEY WERE DONE PLAYING ANNA AND I BOUGHT THINGS FROM THE LAWRENCE ARMS MERCH TABLE WHEN BRENDAN SHOWED UP TO DO SOMETHING AT THE TABLE SO I INTRODUCED MYSELF AND THANKED HIM AGAIN FOR CALLING ME ON MY BIRTHDAY AND HE GAVE ME A HUG.   THEN PIPEDOWN PLAYED AND WELL I THOUGHT THEY WERE GOOD AT FIRST BUT THEY WERE PLAYING THE THEME SONG FROM HEAVY METAL AFTER THEY BEGAN TO PLAY THEIR OWN MATERIAL I BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT THEY REALLY KINDA SUCK.  THEIR LEAD SINGER LOOKS KINDA LIKE A MONKEY AND WAS A MAJOR DOUCHEBAG TO ME AND ANNA.  THEN THE LAWRENCE ARMS TOOK THE STAGE ANNA APRIL AND JESSI WATCHED FROM A BACKCORNER WHILE I WAS IN THIS HUGE MESS OF PEOPLE I GOT A TON OF HOPEFULLY GOOD PICTURES AND I HAD TO ASK THIS REALLY BIG GUY TO MOVE LIKE 2 STEPS BACK AND ONE STEP OVER AND HE WAS REALLY NICE AND DID.  AFTER THEY WERE DONE WE WENT OUT THE BACK DOOR AND TALKED TO THEM AND CALLED FOR A RIDE.  WE WOULD HAVE STAYED TO WATCH TSUNAMI BOMB PLAY BUT IT WAS FRIGGIN PACKED AND I THOUGHT WE WOULD ALL DIE OF HEAT EXHAUSTION AND PLUS WE WANTED TO GO TALK TO THE LAWRENCE ARMS.  SO YEAH IT WAS AWESOME DESPITE ALL THE GROPINGS I GOT FROM STRANGERS AND THE WHOLE ALMOST DEHYDRATING THING.  ALSO I GOT PUSHED AND FELL ON THIS REALLY SHORT REALLY SKINNY GIRL WHO DIDN'T LOOK MUCH OLDER THAN 12 BUT SHE SORTA DESERVED IT FOR SITTING ON THE GROUND AND STRETCHING HER LEGS OUT ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING HOW PACKED IT WAS.      SO BASICALLY A GOOD TIME WAS HAD BY ALL EXCEPT MAYBE THAT GIRL I FELL ON.      SHUT UP SHARKY AND GO CATCH A DELICIOUS BASS!, TAGUE
