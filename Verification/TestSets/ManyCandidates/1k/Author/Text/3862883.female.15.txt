Kurts wants captin willer not to judge him because he thinks he will judge him as crazy he doesent see himself as crazy also i think he dosen't like aneyone jugeing aneyone  it sort of reminds me of the part in the story where they are talking about if you take away law's and goverment and everything else that has ever taught that person something will thet know the diffrence inbetween right and wrong captin willer thinks that kurts no longer know's the diffrence inbetween right and wrong
I&nbsp;think kurts is crazy, beacuse of the things he does&nbsp;and the way he thinks and talks, he has completely lost his mind, he kills people, burns the jungle for no reason. He plays god with the people,&nbsp;he created his own kingdom. Captain Willard had a lot a chances to kill kurts but he waited&nbsp;so he can get to know&nbsp;him better. when he had the talk with kurts,&nbsp; kurts&nbsp;&nbsp;told him not in a direct way but he made willard think it was ok to kill him, that he wanted to be&nbsp;killed so he can get away from the pain. so he wasn't just finishing his job he was helping Kurtz.&nbsp;
Kurtz says to Capt. Willard, "You have the right to murder me, but you don't have the right to judge me."&nbsp; DOES Capt. Willard judge Kurtz?&nbsp; Do you? I don't think that Captain Willard really judged Kurtz. The reason that Kurtz thinks&nbsp;Willlard &nbsp;is judging him is because he has encountered men that wanted to kill him because they judge him as a lunitic. Which to me is what I think of him. He is so crazy he is not thinking straight and to&nbsp;him everyone is judging him.&nbsp;Although when&nbsp;Kurtz&nbsp;says, "You have the right to murder me, but you don't have the&nbsp;right to judge me."Willard&nbsp;is sitting&nbsp;in sort of a daise as if he was&nbsp;thinking about what&nbsp;Kurtz&nbsp;was saying. Then that is when Kurtz thinks he is judging him. But Willard&nbsp;had to&nbsp;had been judging Kurtz because why else could he go through with his mission. The reason&nbsp;Willard did kill Kurtz was because he kept on telling himself Kurtz is crazy and he&nbsp;need to&nbsp;stop the darkness&nbsp;that Kurtz has brought upon the people of the jungle and to himself.
Kurtz says to Capt. Willard, "You have the right to murder me, but you don't have the right to judge me."&nbsp; DOES Capt. Willard judge Kurtz?&nbsp; Do you?    &nbsp;  I do not think that Capt. Willard judged him. Capt.Willard murdered him because he could not found any point to judge him. I would murder him too, because there is no chance of &nbsp;judging him.
Kurtz says to Capt. Willard, "You have the right to murder me, but you don't have the right to judge me."&nbsp; DOES Capt. Willard judge Kurtz?&nbsp; Do you?  Yes, he did judge Kurtz. I think he is influenced by Kurtz, there is some change in his mind. After listening to Kurtz, Capt. Willard&nbsp;startes to understand Kurtz's mind, then he judges him and decides to kill him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Willard is sick of the Vietnam war, he is tired of killing people.   Kurtz is insane. The enviroment has changed his thought, he lost his ability to judge&nbsp;what is right and what is wrong. We can see there are corpses everywhere in the movie, and Kurtz is like a KING in that area. Poeple in that kind of place seems to go mad easily, Kurtz was born in a civilize enviroment. After fighting the war, his mind is totally different, he started to&nbsp;act like a barbarian, he started to develope his own kingdom.
Kurtz says to Capt. Willard, "You have the right to murder me, but you don't have the right to judge me."&nbsp; DOES Capt. Willard judge Kurtz?&nbsp; Do you?  Capt.Willard didnt' judge Kurtz, he just followed his mission from what the machine said. He was only thinking about murdering Kurtz, and when he was murdering Kurtz, he didnt' think anything, he was nonhuman, he just acted like a machine. If Capt.Willard had judged Kurtz, maybe he didn't kill Kurtz, he would judge in different way. Even he succeeded his mission, there is nothing left. As I think, even though&nbsp;I got mission to murder Kurtz, I will not follow the mission if I don't want to, becuase I know it's not right thing to do.  &nbsp;
Kurtz says to Capt. Willard, "You have the right to murder me, but you don't have the right to judge me."&nbsp; DOES Capt. Willard judge Kurtz?&nbsp; Do you?  I do not think that Captain Willard judged Kurtz. The reason is that the guy ( Marlow) did not really think. He was going insane and he had no time judge Kurtz.&nbsp;And if he had judged Kurtz then he would have done something instead of just murdering Kurtz.
Kurtz says to Capt. Willard, "You have the right to murder me, but you don't have the right to judge me."&nbsp; DOES Capt. Willard judge Kurtz?&nbsp; Do you?  Captain Willard doesn't exactly judge Kurtz, Kurtz has&nbsp;met some soldiers over the past few years that&nbsp;was sent out for the missions. I think that Kurtz said that is because the soldiers went there before had judge him, so Kurtz said that is just warning Captain Willard.  I dont judge Kurtz, because he is living in a place that in uncivilized and he is not civilized, so i think in that condition he is just doing what can help him survive.
Kurtz says to Capt. Willard, "You have the right to murder me, but you don't have the right to judge me."&nbsp; DOES Capt. Willard judge Kurtz?&nbsp; Do you?
The movie is based on the story Heart of Darkness. Therefore, there are many similarities between the book and the movie. First similarity, the natives are all treated like nonhuman. The army destroyed a village for they like surfing there, and hundreds of natives die or injured. In the book, the British also treat Aricans as ants, they think the natives are insignificant objects, there(natives) life depends on the mood of British. Secondly, both US army and British are going crazy. The madness in their minds cause a
