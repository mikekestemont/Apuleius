It all falls into place eventually.. thats what im used to hearing. Well i hope this is where it falls because this has been the most fun week.. the most fun SUMMER!

Last night... hmm. I dyed my hair darker brown... and uhh it looks a little (ALOT) red.. but i gess other ppl like it so i don't mind. Anyhoo.. after that we all just hungout and did nothin at Reeses.. but it was awesome. Reese & Schneids seem to be testy lately, I hope everything will be okay with them, theyre a good couple I know everything will workout because i know how much they love eachother! But me &amp; John just layed on the tramp and talked n stuff.. i love it how were so alike... its great. I'm just always happy when im around him... Like my hair didnt turn out exactly the way i planned... but I was still fine because he said it was fine and stuff.. it was grate to know that someone cared enough.. i know vicky and reese did too.. i love them both..    TODAY... Ali woke me up at 10:52... and came over to see my hair.. she ended up going on a lunch date with me. We went to DOT*S and got my check.. and we went to Taco Bell.. where my hubcap was stolen (Fuckamufucks) & some weird dude kept talking to us about Taco John's lol... it was grandiful. But yeah.. Theres nothing really left to say except that me &amp; vicky have missing hubcaps in the exact same place on our cars.. haha.. n-e-ways Love ya all.. ASH
