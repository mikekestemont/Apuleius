I finally saw Kill Bill tonight. The first one. It was pretty cool...except there were like 15 minute intervals where everyone talked in Japanese and there weren't any subtitles. I'm not sure if that was supposed to happen, cause I never figured out why some people did the things they did...but it gave me time to focus on Japanese people. I know this is somewhat racist, but I couldn't tell them apart. I bet we look like that to the Japanese. I think Japanese rock bands are the funniest.     Lucy Lui would be hot if she wasn't on The View with Star Jones. All up in her Layne Bryants...
I think I have homework or something due tomorrow, but I'm not sure.      Weird sighting of the day: I saw a lunch lady outside of her designated serving zone after school today. Like...in broad daylight and I SWEAR she was wearing an apron and carrying a spatula. I personally thought that they had bunks in the back room so that they could always and forever make good food for us...but apparently they're letting them out for free time or something. Free time, then bathroom breaks...THEN they'll want to retire because they figure working near a hot stove at 89 is somehow hazardous. Sliding down a slippery slope.     Alias kicks so much ass. I'm only on season two, but I have three more episodes left. I'm saving them all for Saturday night so that I can drown my prom sorrows with Jennifer Garner. Did you know she has a dog named Martha Stuart? ...I didn't read that in YM.
Journalism Trip Recap:        I'm sure there are some of you who think that journalism field trips are gay. Well I spit on you who think that! All I have to say is that if you get to stay in a hotel where the guy to girl ratio is like 2:18 and then you get to stay up all night pillow fighting with the same odds...well, I think that's all I have to say my hetero friends. Anyways, so I went out to Steak n Shake cause I was the milkshake bitch and when I got back to the room everyone was wet and Ma was crying...  ...Long story short me and T's room got trashed and I only slept for three hours and I could only find like 5 of the 17 Maxim nearly-naked-girls pinnups that I had on our wall.     About the Maxim pinnups...wouldn't ANYONE come to the obvious conclusion that the magazines that are next to the comfy chairs on the Hollister porch are free for the taking, even if they are super cool Maxims? Well apparently they aren't (they cost $4.50) and if you take them the beeper won't go off and you get back to your room to discover a price tag on the bag and then you have to pillow fight with a guilty conscience. Damn yous Hollister...damn yous all to hell.
I really like that commercial they play for Fandango before a movie starts...the one where everyone's a bag puppet. Anyways, the best part is when they have the two bags that are supposed to be a married couple and they're like "we don't always go to movies on weekends cause we go clubbin." ...I just thought that was worth bringing up.
So this is my first blogger post and it's kind of cool because I can say whatever I want without it being graded or something.    So tonight was our first track meet, which was cooler and not as embarrassing as I thought it would be. Cause like, I suck at hurdles...even though they're on girly height   I just kind of prance over them. Anyways, I finished the race without any embarrassing incidents...so that was cool. But we have to wear these insanely small shorts that ride up your ass whenever you move...so you always have a wedgie which is ok after like the first 2 hours. And it got really cold outside and you can see everyone in the crowd wearing warm things and then you look at yourself and youre wearing some type of plastic fanny shorts and you end up hating each and every person in that crowd. Yeah...so track kind of sucks sometimes.       I'm kind of upset because today went off without any good April Fools Day pranks...which sucks. I was expecting something to at least explode during lunch. I wonder if other countries have April Fools Day...like Mexico or Algeria or something. Haha...that's kind of funny to think about. Like Mexican kinds making a concrete pinata. THAT would be a good Mexican April Fools Day Joke, seeing that the pinata is practically a daily ritual. I'm movin to Mexico.
School starts soon...something like less than a month. I'm not sure exactly when, but the point is that summer is pretty much over. i kind of wish that they would just surprise me with school because it pretty much just destroys the last few weeks of summer; knowing that school is so close. you cant really focus on everything that  is  summer...youre too worried about how much youre going to hate school. it would be better if like nobody knew when school started so that one day youre just walking down the street and a white van slams on its breaks and kidnaps you and takes you to school. that way, the end of summer isnt ruined...plus it would be kind of cool. you could even tape what goes down so you and your buds can watch the kidnapping later and find out who was the pussy and cried. he'd be like, bitch for a week
I was at Wal-Mart tonight and to my disbelief i saw  Vanilla Sky  in the bargain bin for 5 dollars alongside such hits as  Action Jackson ,  Shaft Goes to Africa , and  Beyblade  (the plot being cartoon japanese kids with crazy hair and big eyes do battle and solve problems via pimped out dradles). I was pissed on two levels...the first that i bought that VERY same copy of  Vanilla Sky &
