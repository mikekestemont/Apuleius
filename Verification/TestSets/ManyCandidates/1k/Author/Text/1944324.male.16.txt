Yes, I know, most of the pictures are sideways. I can't do anything about that.

lol...The Little (Spanish) Pimps.  Nice. Anyways...Marten, you're not the only one stressed.  I think we all are...and everyone in the play is totally needing to be avoided.  So, I understand.  lol, I know my personal reason for being so moody...but ya'll prolly don't care nor want to know.  Yep.  I hope you get un-stressed soon...I miss the old Marten who didn't yell at me for painting the wrong way in stage tech.  :-( SQ(u)EE!
O yeah, I knew that. I saw that he died on the news. hehe. didn't make name connection, never watched price is right.    Erin is the lead in the play. yay erin! I am sad, i think. maybe im just tired.  I need to do speech. the play is affecting me more than I thought it would.  indirectly, of course.  stress pipes. yarg, you interpret. thinky sleep good, burritos.   Sophia:  "its not you, its me" I appologize for moodiness. I stressy. need a punching bag and a very long nap. stuff is leaky.
Erin is a senior who is friend of Comstocks, Marten, and Thomas. By the way Nathan, I posted a blank message accidently while trying to edit a former post, so I had to find some way to use it. I wasn't trying to be nasty or anything. Death to Mr. Hall! SQEE!
Who's Erin?  haha.  Ln has one Native American.  haha.  I find that funny for some reason.  I want to apologize, Marten, for acting like such a...umm...butt-munch?  today.  I don't know what's going on...just some odd hormonal imbalance or something.  Oh well.  Enough about my body's chemistry.  Who's Erin?   SQEE!
Found a useful website today.  Comparative information on public schools of Indianapolis can be found  urlLink here .  All the vital stats, as they say.  I find it really funny that LN has exactly one Native American student.  I think I know her. You know what annoys me?  Ugly people who like to shout across the computer lab about their social lives to equally ugly people.  Hicks is a good, stereotypical word for them, or maybe white trash.  They like to verbally abuse each other. Marten: Bob Barker?  The "Price is Right" guy?  You are so out of it. Thomas: Point taken. SQEE!
Who's Robert?  I hope that text thingy works. I hope I remember to do it. I also hope I remember to do my original oratory manuscript. Thomas wrote his in one night. I laugh. Laugh with me its funny. So was BOO!, a bunch of "scary" shorts that LC players perform.      anywhy, I could've sworn either Nathan or Jonah said something about Lara. Maybe it was just Thomas.  Michael said her posts weren't funny. We must all obey the Great Michael!.    Sophia: there wasn't a real poll. um. don't hit me.  or anything.  Jonah:  I want a spork of doom.  Thomas: I can't go another day without central heating.  Nathan: I hope that works.  Lara wont make a very good minion.    Lara:  You can still post, can't you? I knew I forgot something!  Erin: HEY! ERIN! um... YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO TIME TO POST RIGHT NOW(oops), SO I'M NOT GONNA BOTHER TELLING YOU TO DO SO!(ewok, be happy)  You know, I could take Lara off just cuz this is a lot of people to have on a blog. The spell check on this prgram didn't know the words ewok, Jonah, or Erin. I thought everyone knew those.
See below to see what it would like if I posted as much as you all. SQEE!
SQEE!
The results are in for state. I have the scores but not allowed to post 'em. Sorry Jonah. LC got fourth, which is disappointing compared to last year's second place, but I am still happy with a great performance. We got 6th in music and that is what dragged us down. We got 3rd in visual, and 3rd in general effect. Indy regionals and Grand Nationals will be very exciting.  Nathan: I shared your soul with Jonah and it gave me a soar throat :( Jonah: PiE! Huzzah for marching band despite the Protests of Marten and Soph Sophia: When are we gonna get a duo?! By the way, I do not post often because my posts would be pointless if I did. I only post when I have something to say.  SQEE!
Rest in Peace, Robert Barker.  If all dogs go to heaven, you're gonna have a hard time when they found out who told their owners to spay and nueter them.  Just kidding.  You were a good man, and we hate to lose you.  The price was wrong. I know I've had a lot of Oklahoma titles recently, but it's what I know really well. Marten, go to View, Text size, Medium.  That should solve your problem.  It was a genetics project.  Soph, I likle that name better than Mindless robots and some of the others.  Lara, I'll support you, but only if you agree to be my minion.  Thomas, post more often.  Jonah, you're allergic to souls, remember?  SQEE!
Marten, was this one of those "Hey, Thomas do you think?" polls? 'Cause Nate and I don't remember being polled either.  As long as I'm posting, it's time for the State report-LN version.  We recieved 6th place, a seemingly bad spot.  In fact, though, we were 2nd place in marching to Avon by 3/4 of a point and third in music.  We were only 6th because we were eighth in general effect, and that c
