Inspired by my brethren Jeff Barrett and Brendan Kredell, I've decided to add more (potentially) useless information to the glut that is the Internet and indulge my narcissistic penchant for passive garrulousness.   Grace them:  urlLink Brendan   urlLink Jeff    If you are perceptive you will notice that I shamelessly chose the same Blog template that Brendan did. Good catch. I happen to both support and practice internet appropriation.

hentai is inane. People who clap for it are even more so.  get drunk, spread hate.  J-Hova and B-Rock each possess a commendable element of sassitude.
As it turns out, this blogging thing seems to just be a replacement for email. So this next post is addressed to my arch-nemesis.   I meant what I said. Paul Revere. At that point, your treacherously "tratorial" nature had already been remarked upon. Hence, no need to reiterate; redundancy is a time waster. The ascription of "Paully" was meant to disparage your apparent shouting that, not the British, but the Bloggers are coming. What I meant by this has since been nullified after talking to Brendan. Apparently he found Misreadings all on his very own. Yet, based on his  urlLink article  of last night where he identified you as my arch-nemesis, I assumed you had got on the horn and started yelling "Have you seen Winner's blog? Have you seen that it completely bites your own in both style and content?" (cf. the "in consultation" sentiment of aforementioned Terrain Cognita posting). Obviously, this misreading can only serve as an index of my own shame at being lazy and biting another's style. Perhaps a battle only to be fully reconciled on the 6x6--cardboard confrontation, my man--rock it steady.   As it turns out, you did no such thing. I suppose these types of misunderstandings take place when one is in involved in gangland warfare. Yet the question remains, how did Brendan intuit our rivalrous stance toward one another? Red vs. Blue? Burnt Sienna vs. Aqua Marine? Has word spread so fast along the UofC pipeline? Paranoia is compounding daily.
I think I read somewhere that Martin Luther had a revelatory experience while letting loose the brown torpedo. Yesterday I had a similar experience; it was, unfortunately, much less inspired by the divine. Rather than a direct communique from the Almighty, my pre-articulated insight was conveyed via The Economist Technology Quarterly (March 13th, 04, p. 18). Further, it did nothing to strengthen my faith. If anything, it did quite the opposite.   Previous to doing my "duty" yesterday night, I had high hopes for my blogging enterprise. To the question, "Will blogging--the practice of maintaining an online diary, or weblog--revolutionize journalism?", I would have answered with a resounding "IT SHALL." To the inquiry, "Do the world's bloggers really constitute a 'second superpower', the only force on earth capable of keeping America's neo-imperialist government in check?", I would have resounded "Friends, Comrades, step with me onto this new Shining Path, for it is We who shall prevail!"   Well, apparently, the question we should all really be asking is: "Or is the blogging craze just an example of sound and fury signifying nothing--a re-run of the late 1990's fad for personal websites, only with easier to use publishing software?" Apparently it is. Why? Simply put, "while bloggers--half of whom are teenagers--are convinced they are changing the world, not everyone agrees. There are even some people beyond the insular world of the "blogosphere" who have not ever heard of blogging at all." All is for naught it seems.  Yet one must wonder...Is it mere coincidence that this article made its way into my hands a mere 3 days after my initial foray into  blogging? If I hadn't read somewhere that Martin Luther took divine dooks I would be inclined to say yes. But, as the Pot seems to be the Purveyor of the Divine Truth, now I am not so sure. According to Gee-Dubbya, everyone has a god-given penchant for neo-imperialism. Therefore, all blogging that attempts to thwart this effort is uncharitable, and, let's face it, straight up sinnin'. Perhaps I have simply been set on the true path--a path that shines not with revolutionary fervor but with the grace of the Almighty who calls for a free world and a safe America.   So i reiterate, in the the end, all our rants and raves, our sound and our fury, signify and accomplish nothing. But this is ok, it is as it should be. The revolution is not forthcoming, because it has been, is, and will be televised. So just sit back and watch. Then write some vacuous, pubescent thoughts for no reason. If I didn't convince you, go do(x2) your duty as an American and discover the revelation that awaits you. One tip...make sure the toilet paper isn't all used up. Thanks Arik.  More on my growing distaste for empty revolutionary rhetoric, blogs or otherwise, later...
Choice Choons o' the day: the lads from Shiloh have graced us with a new eclectic  urlLink mix . Aside from a wack intro (sorry guys), it is pretty locked in. The track at 20 mins or so is fucking tight. Has a little delayed guitar lick reminiscent of the days when Cass n Slide didn't suck. oh sweet nostalgia.   Apparently, I have a new arch-nemesis. I know what you are thinking...is it  urlLink Swarm ? Thankfully, no. For I lack the power, stamina, and wit to thwart such a foe. If you do not empathize with my fear, simply  urlLink listen  to his battle cry and i assure you---you will tremble. (Also, it would behoove you to  urlLink listen  to Kraven as well, apparently someone taped him "introducing" himself to some chick he just banged in the park. And, seriously, how creepy is fucking  urlLink Arachnoid ?! (interrobang, bitch...what.))  According to reliable  urlLink sources  my foe is none other than Denise Bracken. You got it. The new jack. All because I got Ice-T's back. Now she is a turncoat and conspiring with o
