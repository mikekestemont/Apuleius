Things have been pretty quiet around here lately.&nbsp; There is much debate going on between Michael and I over the name for the new baby, I still like Zephyr, and he doesn't like it at all!! but what he does like is...get this....Casper!&nbsp; That's the name of my sisters cat!! Jeez.&nbsp; The solar power debate still goes on here too, I posted a note yesterday saying okay, people I want real power, from what I can tell from living on solar for the past 3 years it's totally inferior to grid a/c power....plug me in damnit!&nbsp; We had a visitor wake up in his own piss in the music room, needless to say I had to put a bounce vote on him, because dang that's just in bad form, and besides our alcoholic quota is full thank you very much.....I walked 1.5 miles on the treadmill hoooray, now that's the way to excercise for me anyways...pop in a movie (today was the Bourne Identity--and what I watched I liked) and zone out and forget I was excercising...now I just have to hope the  treadmill doesn't get trashed by the time I have this baby so I can really use it postpartum to get back to some normal semblance of my body...I can't believe the way I look now.....this is not me I tell myself, and the treadmill is by a mirror, it's really depressing....oh well, 4 more months to go...yipeeeee.&nbsp; Cassidy is cutting four top teeth at the same time!! and remarkably in a good mood too...she's such a sport....enough for now, until next time.

there isn't much going on here the past few days....lets see, there is a nasty stomach flu going around, Michael had it last nite...nasty, I hope Cassidy or I don't get it.&nbsp; The name debate for the new baby still goes on, I am stuck on Zephyr, stuck stuck stuck on it...he named himself before I ever knew I was pregnant, why can't I convience people of that.&nbsp; No one likes the name including Michael so we got the name books and out of 70,000 names I can't find one I like as much....what to do?&nbsp; The weather is terribly hot and humid and the solar power in the house sucks and won't even run our fan all nite so I'm sleeping outside in a tent...geez some life, I shouldn't complain there are many who have it worse, but darnit I want a/c and real electricity, I am so over eco-solar power!! Grid power me baby!!! so off I go back out in the heat...wish me luck that I don't get heat stroke, if my doctor puts me on bedrest this pregnancy I already told Michael and Medcom I'm  doing it in a hotel room they better get used to that idea, I'm not about to do another summer of bedrest with no a/c..forget it...geez can you tell the heat makes me grouchy?  __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?

All is back to normal now, Cassidy is fine, I'm fine...I think I cried more than she did yesterday and she was the one hurt.  Hormones..gotta love em.  Our solar is crapping out on us again and I slept outside last nite because it was so damn hot in the house...we have to get real power.  I'm going to try and call again, there seems to be only one engineer with the power co-op out here in these woods and he's never availible to come out and see about running lines...Michael would like to stay off the grid but now that I have babies (Cassidy and the one on the way this december) I am just not that idealistic anymore.  I want power and I want it now.  Well I'm off to ebay, trying and trying to get Cassidy some robeez shoes...the best is always the most...
Well today was Cassidy's first bloody injury.&nbsp;&nbsp; The morning started off so good, she was in such a good mood, we were playing in bed and I got up to get a diaper to change her and she was still playing and thought I was gonna "get" her so she lunged, and lunged right off the edge of the bed.&nbsp; My heart stopped, she was screaming and then I noticed the blood...lots and lots and lots of blood pouring out of her mouth...I panicked, what do I do...no phone to call anyone, and who would I call anyways, no ice to give her, no nothing, so I put her in the stroller and headed up to community, halfway there I had to stop cuz I was having a full out panic attack, I sounded like an asthmatic, wheezing and gasping for air, I could not get a breath it felt like my lungs were full of lead, by this time cassidy had stopped crying, she and I both were covered in blood standing in the road....Michael found me in the road freaking out and trying to get a breath, it was not a good  morning....her whole inside top gum is busted open and may even be exposing her teeth which hadn't even started to come in yet, but it's hard to tell because it's hard to get a good look into a 10month old baby's mouth, I have asked and showned the best I could every parent here and they all say although it looks really bad on the inside, babies heal really well and she probably doesn't need to go to the doctor, I couldn't take her anyway, someone else would have to be in there while they held her down to look at it --I can't take anymore screaming, blood, or hurt babies this morning.... I've discovered I'm not good in emergency situations....Maybe it's my pregnancy hormones but I haven't stopped crying about it, I feel like such a failure, if I can't handle a fall off a bed how will I ever get through the b
