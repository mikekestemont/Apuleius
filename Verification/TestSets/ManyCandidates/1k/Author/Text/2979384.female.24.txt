1985    I could vaguely remember that I had already started immersing myself into my siblings’ texts when I was no more than 5 years old. My bro was in P1 then, and my sis, P3. We stayed in a diminutive 3-room flat in Clementi for a while. That was a rented place, as my parents couldn’t even afford any proper dwelling for the family. There were already rules on subletting an entire flat back then, so whenever there were visitors, my parents would freak out. I never understood all this till I learnt about the HDB rules and policies just recently.  Anyway, back to the part where I was reading at least 2 to 4 years ahead of my age. My parents were always so proud of me, especially my mum, who probably thought I was a child prodigy. My dad adored me too; he always commented on my long feet. Well, they all thought that long feet guaranteed me to grow up real tall. But heck! I’m still short, at 1.58m. And I doubt I can grow any much taller. But at least I’m qualified to be an air-stewardess. Hur hur.  Somehow, we shifted to Bukit Panjang not long after. It was a small flat as well, but cosy. Perhaps it was the compactness of the accommodation that brought the family closer together. We weren’t that close-knitted, but we shared everything together. The bed in the one and only room; the TV; the kitchen. Imagine five people in the same arena and you’d know what I mean. Probably we were being compelled by the environment to share the stuff, but I felt happy. Not all the time, but the bulk of it. There was only once when I cried so hard and dashed to the room, drenching the pillow with my never-ending tears. My sis was there too, but she largely ignored me. Can’t blame her; she’s 4 yrs my senior after all, and obviously thought I was being juvenile.   I studied in a kindergarten in the same neighbourhood when I finally reached 5. I wasn’t intrigued by the syllabus being taught at all. I had started to read up to P3 stuff already, remember? I only enjoyed drawing classes, though I wasn’t that talented in art. Unlike my sis. She could draw anime real well. In fact, I think she got into some drawing competition before. Sud sud! My mum believed that she was pretty good too, and wanted her to advance her skills. So there was once when she persuaded my dad to drive around Bukit Timah area, cos she was informed by some auntie that there was a well-known artist living there. Somewhere. We went round in circles umpteen times, and finally chanced upon this dark, dilapidated “hut” that looked like what an artist would stay in. Poor artists. They never earn much until they pass on, do they?   I can’t remember whether my sis did take up the art class or not. My memory around that period of time died, probably due to the fact that I was trying to keep up in class. I felt that I was jinxed. Cursed. Cos I always came in position number 8, no matter how hard I studied. All the way till P1 or P2. Anyway, I didn’t even want to study 2 yrs in kindergarten then. I vaguely recall telling my mum that I would study only one year in kindergarten. Guess I was too dumb to understand things called “semester” huh. Halfway through kindergarten, I switched schools, cos my dad finally bought a place to stay in for us, in Woodlands New Town. That was in 1986.     1986    Yup, we moved in to our new place in 1986. It was a 5-room flat. Finally, we needn’t share room nor sleep in the kitchen anymore. My parents occupied one room; my sis and me another one; and my bro all by himself. What to do? He was the only boy. Anyway, my dad was so excited when we first moved in. He was, in fact, beaming with joy. And that was RARE. He proudly showed to us the picture of the phoenixes on the wall of the main living room. And the design of a beach on the wall in my balcony. He even told us then, that fish would jump out of the sea if we stared at it hard enough. And we actually believed him.  The kindergarten that I got into was at Blk 101. Which is very near the stadium. I had my first “bf” in K2. Well, we never kissed or anything like that. On the very first day I met him, he actually broke all his crayons into half, so that he could share with me. I was so touched! Moreover, he was such a popular bloke in school then. Somehow, we distanced apart gradually. I think the rest of the gals didn’t like me back then. Cos he was so cute, and I wasn’t. So the kindergarten photo featured him in the centre with a really pretty gal called “Lin Xing Xing” and me, with a Malay gal called “Rubah”. I’m surprised that I still remember their names, but I didn’t remember his. Rubah became my P1 classmate anyway.  There was once when my teacher organised a field trip to… somewhere…. Okay, I don’t remember where… But it didn’t matter. But that Lin Xing Xing actually blatantly told cutie boy to stay away from me! I really hated her that time man. But she’s really a pretty and smart gal – someone whom I definitely can’t offend. Throughout the entire journey, she was yakking and yakking with the rest of the class whilst I was left all alone. How could anyone talk so much??? How much would a 6-yr-old know to be able to share with others??? Well, she’s smart anyway. She even came in 3rd. While I end up being number 8 again. You’re probably thinking, “Hey 8 is a lucky number in Chinese culture, so it’s not so bad!” B
