I'm re-doing my about me bit, it's too long. It may be crap but it took me a while to write so I'm posting it for posterity  I'm a girl who's old enough to be calling herself a woman now, not a girl, and takes offence if referred to as a girl by most other people. I'm an optimist and romantic, with those ideals dying slowly and painfully each day that I spend in the real world (I try to avoid that though) I'm a feminist, and love to be feminine, without that being taken to mean I'm in some way a lesser person than one who has their genitals hanging about on the outside. I love to be treated like a lady by a man who is a gentleman, but does not see weakness in my gender. I hate to be hated and reviled by other women because I love to be sensual and approach physical pleasure in a way that would be perfectly and widely acceptable were I a man. I hate the double standards that exist in this world. I hate lies, but hate people who parade insensitvity and malice under a flag of openness and honesty. Those who feel that any mean words can be excused if followed by "I'm just being honest...". I may seem self absorbed at times, but believe that thinking of others costs nothing and will be paid back through a kind of karma. And I have an exception skill for navel gazing and writing flowery crap!
Here's a list of things which are insulting and apparently not insulting.  I've learned them in the last year or so, I really had no idea!     It is insulting to point out that someone who is older than you, is older than you.  It isn't insulting to disregard a 27 year old as being dumb and ignorant, simply because you are OLD.  It is insulting to ask a supposed friend how their current relationship is going.  It isn't insulting to tell someone that they'll never get over you, move on in life or find someone who will want them and love them, the way you used to but don't any more.  It is insulting to comment with genuine concern that someone is loosing weight, when you worry that it may mean they're ill.  It's ok to comment on how fat someone is, and constantly refer to them as fatty and fatass.  It's wrong to jokingly point out a (one amongst many) new grey hair.  It's just fine to tell someone their skin looks like shit, not jokingly, and&nbsp;in a "not sure I want to be seen with you" way,&nbsp;even though you are well aware that they have their period due in a day's time.   and most of all   It's perfectly OK to lie about every aspect of your life to someone, just to make sure you can carry on screwing them, and still insist you care about them when discovered, and maintain that no wrong was done by you doing this.  Under no circumstances should you react, on discovering the above, in a manner that is angry or emotional, nor should you blame said liar, as it was done with your own interests at heart really, considering being used as a cheap fuck in a hotel room by someone who you have trusted implicitly is probably all that keeps you going, silly girly!
"hi, I miss our arguments !!!! Seriously, I miss talking with you x"     &nbsp;  This was yesterday! His response to me not answeing emails. He's also used a different mail address, so someone's told him that I've redirected all mail from his usual one to my spam folder.   Talking about what, is what I want to know!   Way back when, before the whole relationship debacle, we did talk. We'd sit over a drink and chat about all sorts, music, movies, the state of the world, all the usual stuff. We'd talk about our relationships, our respective love lives. We were really close mates so this was not unusual.   Maybe it's the storyteller in him, he needs create a total fiction and I'm the only one he feels comfortable enough to share it with.  Maybe he's just a full of shit control freak.  Hmmmm....   For the past 6 months, the only times he's talked to me about his love life or relationship, it's been a total fabrication. The only other totpic of conversation has been him arranging when we could possibly meet up, and that was only for sex. I'd agree, wanting to sit and talk with my friend. W'e meet in a hotel, have sex, then he'd put on the TV and each time I opened my mouth he'd shush me.  Any films or music I liked were laughed at and scorned as dumb and unworthy of his conversation. He didn't want to talk about music or films, just sex, or even forgo conversation altogether and just have sex.  Our relationship, it's past and possible (according to him) future, were completely taboo topics. If I talked about them, I was being a "bunny boiler"&nbsp;or was trying to make him feel bad for dumping me, apparently.  If my love life came up, I got a barrage of questions. I have no love life these&nbsp;days. Before I found out the extent of his lies, and was still being told constantly by him that we'd get back together, I only slept with him and I didn't date. I didn't want to anger him.&nbsp; Now that I have found out (apart from being to broke to go anywhere anyway!) I feel sick just thinking about sex, and my opinion of men is not exactly&nbsp;at it's highest point. I knocked down a lot of hard-built walls to let him in, I'm not doing that again for anyone.  If I was feeling bold, and said that I was making an effort to find someone new, he'd laugh out loud at me, saying "Yeah, right..." And "why fight the inevitable, we are meant to end up together".   Since I stopped sleeping w
