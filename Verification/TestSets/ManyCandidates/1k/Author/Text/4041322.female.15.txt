Oh i just wish someone were here with me right now, to share this boredom that i posess. Summer is going to be over before i know it, these are my last days of it, and i am not doing anything. I am just sitting here wasting my night online, once again, and its so typical of my night. I want to do something thats perhaps different. Something that just makes me feel alive, becuase right now i dont feel alive, i feel quite dead, and motionless. I need something.    But no, tonight is not a good night to live, tonight i must babysit my little brothers, and make sure that they are safely tucked in their warm beds, and i need to make sure nothing unusual happens tonight. and that everything is comfortable in this house..      I guess it leaves no room for me to go out, and try something new. hahah. ahh what would i do anyways. who am i kidding???      any suggestions, on how to step out of the box?? any suggestions that wouldn't sacrifice my morals? haha... any? ah guess not.
Well last night, Amy invited me to go to her old youth group up in Jamestown, New York. At first i have to admit, i really didn't feel like going, after a day of just laying around, and sleeping, and watching movies, i wasn't really motivated to do much of anything. I especially didn't feel a desire to go to a youth group, where i don't know anyone, and in which i wouldn't get home until like 12:30. Alright taking all of the cons into consideration, i decided to go anyways. I guess i needed to get out of the house anyways.      So yeah we went, when we got there, to tell you the truth it wasn't anything special. i mean YES they had some snacks on the counter and had some cool oldies playing. and people were dancing but, that's not really something i can enjoy to the fullest when i only know two people there. So Amy, Phil and i just hung out, and i was enjoying myself, meeting new people and what not.       Anyways this entry isn't about me meeting people, its strictly about what i remembered when i was there. We started the whole musical part of our worship, the band playing, the people clapping, voices lifted. But i wasn't feeling it, i was just kind of standing there thinking about.........everything i guess... I dont know if any of you know what i am talking about, but it's like when you are praying and then all of a sudden you find yourself thinking about something else or someone else. well thats what was going on. i was clapping and singing but my mind wasn't there, and either was my heart.      So onward the music went, and finally they played a song that i knew. I dont know about you, but you tend to appreciate songs more when you know the words, and you don't have to look at a screen to sing them. During the song i think it was "breathe" I looked around. and realized that nearly everyones hands in the room were lifted, everyones eyes closed. And i just thought for that second... Wow.... i've forgotten about the fire i once had...my drive to become the best christian i could.       it was all forgotten.       I realized i was living a lazy christian life.. Somedays i was on, somedays i was off. And as i stood there and thought about that, i just felt overwhelmed, my selfishness had just finally came back to haunt me....haha i'll have to say it was a little scary... finally noticing that i wasnt really where i wanted to be...      during that song, i lifted my hands up... and for the first time since creation, i felt the power of the holy spirit come over me, and i just smiled to myself, and comprehended the fact that i was back to the heart of worship. Hahaha, well right after some amazing praise songs, like "Let it rain" and someother great ones, i ran over to my purse grabbed a pen and paper and wrote down,     "Don't forget the feeling, your redeemer lives."      I think that piece of paper is going to stick with me for a long time, just in the times of discouragement when i don't feel anything. i can look at that paper, and realize I used to, and use that to encourage me to get on my feet again.      Idea- If you are ever feeling something wonderful, take a second and write down how you feel, that sentence or two can mean a whole lot for the rest of your life.
Yesterday was probably one of the first times i sat down and had a devotion on my own. It felt really good for some reason, finally diving back into the book of life. Diving into something that actually has a huge importance to me. So anyways i did a little study thing on finding myself, and discovering my spiritual gifts, and being patient in waiting to figure out what they are.     &nbsp;   but anyways, the point is i think i am finally getting back on track. and i think for once in my "walk", i am not relying on a church or a youth group to get me&nbsp;to that level.&nbsp;i am relying on God to get me on fire not anything else, to be honest..     &nbsp;   AND thats something that really frustrates me there mere fact that&nbsp;people put all of their hope in their churches, and putting their faith in a pastor more or less then a God. Its sad to see a youth group fall apart or even a church fall apart, and then see everyone that was within it fall apart spiritually, and lose faith in what was the most important thing in the first place.     &nbsp;   I guess if you ask me, i think sometimes chruches can be brainwashing. They tend to tell you what you can and can not d
