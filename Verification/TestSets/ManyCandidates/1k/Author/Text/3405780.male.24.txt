There are times when something comes my way where I literally say to myself, ‘Oh boy, I sure didn’t need to hear that.’ Well, it’s been that way recently. But it has been the norm when we experience such breakthroughs, things will begin to come our way. It’s  test time, plain and simple. I’ve had the opportunity to learn from God’s Word, and now the time has come to apply it.  Well this is the case at this present time. I must continue to endure a situation which I am beginning to feel is a dead horse, but I know otherwise. It takes a lot of my patience; I’ve been dealing with it for years, hoping that the here and now is the time for breakthrough, but all signs point otherwise. Still, I am continuing in faith, that I will not become disenheartened in this situation.  Today’s verses: “  31 And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: 32 But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren. "
Well, I will keep it short and sweet tonight. I had neck pain so I took something for it, which has an added sleep ingredient so I will be off to bed soon. Today was ok, a little slow, but ok. There is a tornado warning west of here but I'm not going to sweat it. If it kills me, I'm ready to meet my maker. :-)     Today's Verse:   "Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness,  for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."  Matthew 5:10
Well I said I was going to fall back on  Blinx  when  Shenmue II  got a little tiring, but  Shenmue  is turning out to be a very demanding game. I want to always see what is around the next corner so I can't stop playing. When I play I mean. The last couple of days have been good church days so I've been easing along...*wink wink. ;-) I feel so great, like I haven't felt in a long time. I am on a new level of glory I believe, the joy of salvation has been restored in my life.  On another note I am a bit disappointed. The G4TV/TechTV merger became official today. They do have some interesting shows I will have to look into, but I will miss  Call For Help.   I'm probably annoying somebody out there with the italicizing of these words, huh?
I have quickly gotten tired of a little opening I see too often, it's only a couple of  words but they irritate me.    'So I blah blah blah...'   So I this, so I that. In case you didn't get it yet, I am talking about the " So I " part.   Oh well. I just read something to that effect just now, so I thought I'd write about it.
Well, now that I have better composure, I can more in detail describe my pain last night. I thought I was getting a migraine, it's been about 10 years since I had (my only) one. I had a deep ache especially in the front of my head and was sick to my stomach, though I was not sensitive to sound or light. I finally went into deep sleep about 4 this morning and since then have not had a big problem.  We went to hear Evangelist George Wright tonight. It was an amazing service and I was glad to go. I am fired up for next week, when I minister for Wednesday's services.    "For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.   For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.     Psalm 18:28, 29
Well, I want to be regular in posting entries here, so in spite of my condition, which I will get to later, I will tell about tonight.  The lady I mentioned in a previous post was at my church tonight. I really enjoyed it.  After services on the way home, I broke out into a sweat and was overcome with a headache and nausea, which I still have. So I will now go to bed.
As I am writing this entry, I look out my window and can see/hear the squirrels in the mulberry tree right outside my window. I have the window open. It’s one of those days where it is not really hot enough to turn the air conditioner on, but it is humid enough to make one sweat, namely me.   I can stand both cold and hot, but I guess you would call me more hot natured. For me, the ideal temperature would probably be 70 instead of 72.  This is just a filler entry, I suppose. There is stuff going on, but I don’t want to get into details in a public area.
Some can't grasp the concept of both beauty and devotion. They jump to the assumption that if, for example, a song is overly fancy or beautiful, then the person must be doing it for the wrong reason or just to get noticed. I would have to ask: Is it possible that a person could sing a song and be both beautiful/anointed?   Well, that's a little off topic. I am listening to a version of  Amazing Grace  being sung by a lady, who I think is Swiss. She has a nice voice, a deep motherly tone. This song is truly blessed, especially coming from such a person. You can tell if a person is singing for fun, to entertain, or an expression of worship. This lady loves the Lord.  This song has given me strength and encouragement tonight. I recently became aware that I hit a brick wall with a certain situation before me, but I am now confident that God will see me through. I will admit that it was a struggle for me, bur I am determined to keep on marching through. I was tempted to go off t
