Not a whole lot going on lately that's happy...and my goal is not to make anymore depressing posts.  Basically, I'm having issues with Randy, my ex boyfriend, missing my little brothers, and having PCOS.  I'm feeling really dismal and unloved.
So lately, I've been wonderin   Who will be there to take my place   When I'm   gone, you'll need love   To light the shadows on your face   If a great wave   should fall   It would fall upon us all   And between the sand andstone   Could you make it on your own   If I could,then I would   I'll go wherever you will go   Way up high or down low   I'llgo wherever you will go   And maybe, I'll find out   The way to make it   back someday   To watch you, to guide you   Through the darkest of yourdays   If a great wave should fall   It would fall upon us all   Well I hope   there's someone out there   Who can bring me back toyou   Runaway with my heart   Runaway with myhope   Runaway with my love   I know now, just quite how   My life andlove might still go on   In your heart and your mind   I'll stay with you for   all of time   If I could turn back time   I'll gowherever you will go   If I could make you mine   I'll go wherever you will   go               "Never a wish, greater than this, when you only got 100 years to live."
