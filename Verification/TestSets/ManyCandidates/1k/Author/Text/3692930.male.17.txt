I couldn't keep my promise of updating this 3 times a day. Oh well! Here's to trying again. I was taking hostage by an addiction called billiards, more specifically online 8-ball. And wasn't let go until I couldn't take my bad odor and proceeded to shower. Eww! (I know) but after all that loss of sleep it took a big hit on me this morning and I missed going to school for the 3rd time. I got to tell ya, 8-ball along with chatting to the other player at the same time is really cool and then the fear of losing your credits adds to the addictiveness (I got $2.00 remaining from the $5.00)
Anyways even though I did skip a day today's the one that matters since 17 years ago I was born in a city known as McAllen.  And hopefully I'll get a new digital camera for a present. Anyways yesterday I was on the computer all day trying to make a website and learning how to animate in Flash MX and finished a measly 2 second animation that said a clip "the world is a vampire", from Despite All My Rage by Smashing Pumpkins. Well if you want to see the sorry excuse of a (Chobits)website I made then just click   urlLink HERE  I also working on another website made entirely of one picture via layers and slices in Photoshop. Well from now on I'm gonna try to update my thingy here 3 times a day. Here hoping I can!    "Computers are useless. They can only give you answers."  Pablo Picasso.
Well I was gone battling a virus, an annoying piece of shat that had burrowed itself into my computer after I used a fake crack for a ____ program. ^_^ I'm not saying what I was trying to hack, but I will say this...It certainly taught me a lesson and I ain't gettin' near another one of those "cracks". I was able to get rid of it after first going to an online virus "sweeper" that destroys everything that looks like virus and had put itself in every folder that contained the word "share". I think it was trying to spread whenever I shared something with other people.  Anyways...It couldn't delete a process that was running in the background "explored.exe"   Okay that's it...Oh yeah!...Finally I'm gonna download ep 89 of Naruto from [Anbu-AonE] today as soon as I finish downloading this giant .torrent dowload of 5157.0 MB!  5 #$@*&#%! gig's!  Ohhh, the power of bittorrent!    I also made some funny animated gifs that I ripped straight from videogames: Mario running      (Mario 1) Mario running      (Mario Advance) Mario walking away (Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga) Mario running      (Mario 3) Link running       (Zelda:Link to the Past)
Hey it's Friday!  No Summer school today and I got up around 4:46 I was checking if the (translated version) Anbu-AonE_Naruto 89 episode had been released since the raw(not translated) one was cool to have but, all I really want is to understand whats going on.  I did get a version of episode 89 translated by some no-name group called SG that just used the dialogue from the manga and put it on the episode.  Well hope it comes out soon.  Okay...what else...Oh yeah more funny Flash movies I want to link:   urlLink History of Fuck   urlLink Free your Mind  (it's a funny Matrix parody with a...squirrel...thingy. Maybe a chipmunk?)  Well enough of this. Loading...    All computers are designed to be a perfect machine without mistake, until the first person touches them.
It's hard...and plus I gotta sleep to make up for all the late hours I stay up. Sometimes I don't even sleep and stay awake through the night like today for example, and the very reason that I'm writing this.  Did I mention I'm 16........Anyway I am, and My B-day is June 29 (5 days from now).  So that means I still go to school and there's this punishment called "Summer school" that you receive for not doing your work in class.  And guess who's the lucky person that gets that beautiful prize?  You guessed it. It's almost over and that means I get to have my head glued to computer monitor all day.^_^  And now for that Naruto. If you haven't heard of this anime before  Anyway it's over for now see you later!         ^_^ anime rules!   urlLink narutofan.com      urlLink narutochaos.com        the bigger the cushion, the better the pushing -fat clown from "House of a Thousand Corpses"
Well it seems I forgot that I have a blog and haven't posted. But that's all right cause chances are that nobody saw this. Anyway I was too busy posting stuff at  urlLink [adult swim]   and I guess I enjoyed it too much wasn't productive at all. Wait a minute....yes it was! I found a link to some funny flash animations all about Mario and they are hilarious some are sad and epic.    funny ones   (some guys humming the song with drums...rocking!)  urlLink http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/mario.php    Mario dying  (it's pretty much Mario dying)  urlLink http://www.geocities.com/Funny_Blast/mariodeath.html    Sad Ones   Part 1  urlLink Part 2   urlLink Part 3    urlLink Part 4    Well that's pretty much it.  Note to self: Wake up early! You!         "Give someone a fire and he is warm for a day, but set him on fire  and he is warm for the rest of his life."
ooh it feels so tingly and stuff!...and may I quote what a wise man once said, "It's like a koala crapped a rainbow in my brain!"  ^_^ And now I become another person who writes those very words. So you can't put pictures huh? Well I'll try some ASCII art later.
Well right now it's 12:47 and I'm just about ready to go to sleep.  Today when they picked me up it was Sargeant Farias who came in my recruiter's car.  We go a little lost when looking for another guy cause Farias doesn't know the area that well.  While looking for the guy we asked someone for directions and ended up giving the guy a ride(I think he was an illegal) anyways we found h
