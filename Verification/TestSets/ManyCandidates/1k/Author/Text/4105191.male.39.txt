urlLink    I do not harvest a deer every season. In fact, in the 12 years that I have deer hunted seriously, every season, and with great effort, I have taken a total of four deer. I consider myself a "trophy hunter". By that, I mean that each year I hunt for a buck that is "better" than the last one I took. "Better" can mean a lot of things--more points or a cool non-typical rack, or even a genetic anomaly to its coat (such as piebald, albino, etc.) I've never seen a cool non-typical or otherwise odd deer yet. That's OK. I'm plenty patient. I once went through a 6 year dry spell--letting lots of good legal bucks walk. Anyway, THIS particular deer was a mistake. I was hunting in an area that has very dense thickets. I could see this deer's body, and I could tell that he was quite a bit heavier than the previous 8-point I had taken. But because of the heavy cover and thickets, I could only get tiny glimpses of his antlers. I could tell he had enough points to be a legal deer, but I could not get a good-enough look to count the exact number of points. I also had only two seconds to make my decision before he was gone, so I picked a small hole in the thicket that was over his vitals and snuck the shot in with my 30-30. He was about 40 yards away. He went down in his tracks and never even kicked his legs. I learned later, when I was cleaning him, that I had made a direct hit through the heart. Instant kill. I was a little disappointed when I got to him and saw that he was an 8-point, but he was still a nice buck. I spent the $300 to have a sholder mount done and he makes a nice addition to my study at home, bookending my walls with his cousin (pictured below). But here's what makes this experience most painful-- because this happend, I spent too much time eyeballing a buck the next year--not realizing he was a REALLY nice, wide-racked 10 point until it was too late. He strolled away into the thickets without offering me another shot. Ah, well. Thats why I like hunting, I guess....its full of unpredicability, foibles and disappointments...but there is also always the off-chance something remarkable is going to happen.  Crit  urlLink
Well, I did not have any cell service in the White River National Wildlife Refuge, but I do now. We are at our usual deer hunting property in Conway county, AR. We had a great trip this morning at the refuge, hiking miles into the timber. We saw several deer and turkeys. We also found bear tracks. Marked three good stand sites on the GPS and then headed back out. It is about 5 PM now and we have a lot of work to do before dark.   Crit
Once each summer my hunting buddy and I take a day off from work to make a trip to the deer camp to scout, move stands, cut weeds, poison the Poison Ivy (sweet justice), hack through the briar patches and clear limbs from our trails. It is hell. Hot, buggy, humid, back-breaking work. We love it. This year it is going to be even worse because we are going to spend the first part of the day investigating a new hunting area in the White River National Wildlife Refuge. We are leaving at 6 AM to drive the 2 1/2 hours to the refuge, then parking the truck, unloading my 2-man boat, and paddling across a bayou. Then I am planning to project a waypoint on my GPS 1 mile due South, which will take us into a very-hard-to-reach area of virgin forest in the refuge. It is there, in the remote reaches of the 160,000 acre refuge, that we are going to scout for locations to hunt this fall. Many a trophy buck has come from the Arkansas delta, and we are willing to work hard to put ourselves in position to get one (or two). We are going to mark the locations we plan to hunt on the GPS and then hike back out. After that, we will make the 3 1/2 hour drive from the refuge to our usual hunting grounds to do our chores...we hope to make it there by 4 PM. If we do not get there by then, we'll be finishing up our chores in the dark before heading home. Its going to be a long day...but worth every second of it. If I am able to get service in the wilderness, I'll blog in from the refuge.  I'm pretty sure I'll have service from our regular deer camp, so I'll send a test blog with any news from there as well.

Only a few more smallies after the 20 1/2 inch largemouth. I am guessing he weighed well over 5 pounds. Its 11 PM now and I am heading for the marina. Great night. Glad I came out. The lake is almost as smooth as glass. Not another soul out here as far as I can tell. I am always amazed at how many more stars you cam see when you get out on the water, away from the street lights. If it were not for mosquitoes I would think I was in heaven!    Crit
I just nailed a 20 1/2 inch bass! Whoohoo!
I am sitting in my boat right now, on the lake by my house, writing this on my blackberry.  It is an amazingly beautiful night, especially for an August night in Arkansas. I was not even planning to go fishing today, but I could not waste such a rare day in what is normally the worst month of the year for heat. It is probably 70 degrees with no humidity whatsoever. I have only caught two small bass so far, but who cares?  I may stay out here until midnight. The sun is setting now, and the d
