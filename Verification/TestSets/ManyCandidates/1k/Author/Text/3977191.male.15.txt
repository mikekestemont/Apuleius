Alright so the concert didn't turn out half-bad. I got my best friend Jeremy to go with me to the show, which was pretty fucking sick if I say so myself. I walked out with a few phone numbers :P. Also, When they got up and played their last song, The CRAZIEST MOSH EVAR! Really. I ran into a friend there. This was our conversation:    ::I smack her arm, she turns around::  "Hey!"  "Hey!"  "What are you doing here" She said  "What do you think I'm doing here?"  "Haha Stupid Question.  I'll be right back."  ::She walks away.  5 minutes later she reappears::   ::We talk about how fucking awsome the show was::  Then she says "Well, i have to get back to my friends, and oh shit, my pants are falling down"  i say "Good to know," and we exchange new phone numbers. As she walks away,. she pulls her pants down the rest of the way, flashes me a beautiful thong on a perfect ass, and walks away.     It was right then I fell over.  Maybe it was the ass, maybe it was the beer I stepped in.  Who knows.    Also, tonight I went out and saw the Bourne supremacy. Awsome movie, a great fight scene, but the chase wasn't all it was cracked up to be. It left story gaps for a 3rd movie. I so would have rather seen Napoleon Dynamite again, which by the way is the FUNNIEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME.   And Jeremy....I know...  But a guy can dream, right?  Plus all the horney bastards that actually read my blog LOL.   Anyways.....yeah.
This is quite possibly the worst day ever. First, It's cold. Real cold. It was 50 in the middle of the summer. But it was raining, so that brightened me up a bit. I like the rain.      So I go to work.  When I get on break, I call Lindsay about the concert.  This was  our phone call:        "Hello"   "Hey, Is Lindsay there?"   "Speaking"   "Hey, I just wanted to let you know, that for the concert tomorrow night, that jeremy and his date won't be able to make it, So it will be just us. I just wanted to make sure that was Okay".   "Oh, I'm not going"   "Why"   "Well, I decided to go on vacation instead"   "Were you planning on telling me?"   I assumed you would figure it    out."     I hung up on her. Stupid bitch hoed me. That just really dug into my skin. So now I had a spare ticket. Conveiniently, everyone I know has *something* going on. literally. EVERYONE. I have to have my damn mom drive me there and back, and I wasted a fucking ticket.    Then to top it off, I got a write-up at work today.  And I was stupid   ,    I Signed it. I shouldn't have signed it, it wasn't something i was at fault for. Yet one more example of me not thinking and being a complete and utter tard.    The only thing that at ALL helped this out was having 60 hours of music on my computor, and a Really good friend. Thanks DeBro.    I really do suck at this whole "life" thing.
Look I did something! I got a few more lyrics up, and here's one of em.    "Careless, Gorgeous, Fatal"     Skin-tastic Tee,    A perfect ass.    More curve than a man could ask,     with her-    Raven black hair and,    Great hourglass.      But she got no reason,    And she got no care,    Why she looks,     The way she dares.      Yeah Yeah Yeah      She got a mind of her own    (Thank god)    Voices her opinion,    And she shapes my world.    I Wish I could have her,    (A girl of my own)    But I can't.    I want to forgive her,     But I won't.      She will Never change,     Because of what she's told.    She does what she believes in,     And it is so bold.    But thats the thing,    She doesn't Notcie me,     How do I get you to see girl,     you Rock my damn world.      Does this song catch you friend?    Do your ears burn?    Have you ever thought of reading signals, even giving me a call?      I doubt it, and you never, will.    A man can dream,     just don't knock me back down.  --------------------------------------       Lost prophets concert t'morrow though, woo!  I can't wait.  I don't know how to break it to Lindsay though.  My friend and his girlfriend wwere supposed to go to the concert with us, but they cancelled.  She's going to think I set this whole thing up.  I hope she still goes.  She made it bluntly clear we are "just going as friends," yet she has told me straighforword that she wouldn't mind dating me.  She keeps send me these mixed signals.  I don't know if she really wants me, If she's just a cocktease, or if she's just schizto.  HELP!!!!   I don't know wht to do, help me out, whatever fans/readers/googlebase I might have.
