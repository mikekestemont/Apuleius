Life is OK. It seems no matter how many events are smashed into one day, I can never decide whether it was good or bad. Example: yesterday was pretty good. I got alot of work done, and after waiting for a while, got to go to the Chicago party at last. That part was great. Also, if you haven't seen it yet, you really should. But as I left to my grandparents house, where I know I don't spend enough time. As I drove down Bamber Valley Road, halfway between the school and the old barn, I looked into my mirror. There was nothing in it except uninhabited, placid darkness. I checked forward again, seeing the lucid glow from a harsh, orangish light at the intersection. Again I looked into the silent dusk. For some reason, looking back, I felt this icy grip on my stomach. There was this feeling that if I went back from this soulless concrete framework, things could finally start working out. I could leave the orderly, uniform rows of houses here and walk into that starry host, where the glow from an iron street lamp won't impede the view. But I knew that I have always loved the city...the history, the elegance, the testament to mankind's will to march in the inevitable parade of progress. I got to my grandparents' house at a little after 11, to find my cousins all gone home, cousins I won't see for at least another few years. I took my coat off, pondering whether I even cared. It was definitely one of the more selfish moments I've had. I talked with my grandma for a while and went to the downstairs room. Drifting off, I heard the orderly, uniform ticks of the antique clocks in the shop. And I thought for a while...how can I ever leave the city, when that is all I've ever known? Why do people spend their whole lives trying to escape that which they are? How can I resist the crisp tick-tock of man's feet, ever walking to the even tempo of progress? As Jerry Garcia said, "Truth is something you stumble into when you think you're going someplace else."
hmmm now it's been a while...So few events to write about though. OH wait, I forgot about Prince Charles, the Willow Creek social worker. I've been getting many compliments on the old people/church story, so I'm on the lookout for more possibilities. this is the stupidest update I've written. NOw time to go people-watching...
Shucks I missed updating yesterday...But there wasn't much to say anyway. I despised Kohl's and don't plan to go back. Ever. That was the entire morning. I bought a scarf. I liked it. Went home and slept, played GTA3. Rented another movie. Watched half. Reminisced about "captain morgan-hayes" and such with one of MF's friends. And I went to bed at midnight and went to church this morning. We had breakfast. during a conversation about LINK crew, Julie R. exclaimed "Lucky LINKies! (giggle)" And then I laughed. I wrote an Oedipus paper today...definitely not by best work. Work--I got to go home 2 hours early! WOO HOO! Sad songs are hott with two t's. Oh yeah last night--harrassing Keith and several of his friends! Bethany Thomaier! YES! back to today...actually I think thats it. I like "evaporated" by Ben Folds.  I think that there's a soul somewhere that's leading me around  I wonder if she knows which way is up, and which is down  . Sarah is good at giving advice, and so she is now my hero. Good Night all!
I took the afternoon off today, because I hate Friday afternoons and I have many papers to write. The Death. So I really like this Rooney CD. After working on register today, I came to the conclusion that I hate my boss. A lot. Also, I missed out on ANOTHER swing dance. Thankfully, we're going to organize one in Florida, hopefully on New Year's Eve. Imagine it, my friends...sigh. Sad times...but good times...what is it going to be like next year? The year when a significant portion of my friends leave? When it will be too late? What then? Why did I go and make friends with all these people who I won't see? And why am I complaining when everyone is faced with this? Satis. I get to thinking late at night, and have to wonder, because I met all these people when I was a freshman, and for three years I've gotten close to them. Now, I don't know what high school will really be like, since I haven't really known it without them. ARGH. And why do these plans of mine always fall apart? Twice now I've made strategic plans that have gone terribly awry, and I can't do anything about them, because now its too late. Whats really weird is that these songs keep coming into my head and they perfectly describe the situations...and they are all eerily the same three songs. Like the song in my last entry. Gosh, too much to think about tonight. I hate it when I sound whiny. But I guess, again, I'm going to deal with it. In closing, the song  Iris , by The Goo Goo Dolls, is a great song and everyone should listen to it. Later.
Bipolar night. Am I happy or depressed? I don't even know, and it's all about a stupid little thing that doesn't even matter. Screw it, I'm sick of being sad over things i can't control. A song which is eerily reminiscent of the time is Annie Waits... "Annie says, 'You see? This is why I'd rather be alone.' And so, Annie waits, Annie waits, Annie waits for a call from a friend. The same, it's the same, why's it always the same?" ARGH. Somebody call me. On a lighter note, I got the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me today, in note form. And I just want to say, Sarah, in less eloquent terms, everything you wrote to me has made my d
