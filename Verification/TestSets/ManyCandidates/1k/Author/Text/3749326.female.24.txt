For no other reason than not having to answer to anyone, the weekends are great.  I love spending time with my dog and lately I have been taking loads of pics of him because we got him groomed and he is so damn cute!  I have never felt so good about myself emotionally, however, I am sick of being fat!  And sick of being flabby and out of shape and sick of hiding my "flaws" and sick of going shopping and feeling like crap.  So, I HAVE TO WORK OUT.  I loved it last summer.  It was my release after Jo and I broke up and I looked and felt a lot better plus, I looked hot in cute little dress (and when I mean little I mean a size 12 dress).  I just want to be a size 9/10.  That's all!  I know that's two dress sizes down but I know I can do it if I work hard and watch what I eat.  So, I am going to eat salads for lunch everyday and have a nice healthy dinner.  (chicken and veggies)  It's been tough eating right at night because I have started dating a new guy and he loves to go out (like I object) to eat at great places!  However, I have added tons of fuits and veggies into my diet and have picked up on the water intake.  ARG... Working out is KEY!  It's been a pretty quiet day.  (thankfully)  Mom's fathers day patio furniture was delivered and she got to swing on the porch swing, which was nice to watch. I didn't get to swing because I had lunch with Caitlin.  We both are living back at home with our moms and we needed to vent.  She is the only one who understands my situation right now.  We are going to Greeley tomorrow with some of our girlfriends to the Rascal Flatts show and to the Rodeo.  Very excited about that.  And it will get us out of the house.  I am lucky though, cause mom has a BF and spends the night at his place 2-3 times a week.    Today it stormed.  It's been so rainy and stormy here this month.  I love it.  We need it too.  Kennedy gets so freaked out.  Today he even jumped into my lap.  HE NEVER DOES THAT.  I had mom take a picture of it and now it's my wallpaper on my computer.    Random thought of the day:  I can't even tell you how many marriage proposals I get after telling a guy (hockey fan) that I have season tickets!   I can't even tell you how far I am from the thought of marriage.  I knew Jo and I weren't going to get married probably by the end of year one.  We weren't meant to be and he needed to experience life outside of Colorado and the US.  He is fulfilling his dream and sounds like he has finally found his place in life.  I read the emails he sends to his friends and family (I get them from his friends Eddy and Carla) and he sounds like another person.  No one I have ever known.  Jenny asked me a few weeks ago if I missed him.  I told her that I didn't miss the old Jo and the new Jo is someone I have never known.  Carla said that Jo might want to hear from me, but I think that I probably caused him too much pain with the breakup.  I am sure he just wants to move on.  It really was such a painful time and I have never been so depressed in my life.  We were just so different.  I am such a goodie-goodie and Jo broke a few of my life rules.  I am not even sure why we stayed together.  We just were raised differently and grew up in very different neighborhoods.  However, I loved his family.  It was huge and they always were so nice to me.  I do miss that.  A lot.  But sometimes love isn't enough and a great family isn't enough.    I thought for sure I would accept some of his habits and mature, but I didn't... and in the end, the habits and my immaturity got in way.  Plus, he wasn't ready to settle down and all I have ever wanted was to be married.  It's actually almost been a year since we split.  I haven't seen him since, either.  We almost met up, but I kept putting it off because I didn't want to complicate things.  It's for the best.  His friends, Eddy and Carla are having a house warming party next weekend.  They invited me, but I am not sure I want to go.  It's still pretty painful and the last time I saw one of his friends, things didn't go very well.  Jo found out that I ran into one of his friends and he went nuts and called me on my birthday and bitch/cussed me out for conversing with his friend.  That was the last time Jo and spoke to each other.  It didn't end on a good note and that's part of the reason I don't really want to email him.  Everyone knows how I am.  I always say that it is easier to be mean to me that it is to be nice when ending something.  Like when my Dad passed away, everyone would come up to me and say things like, we love you or other nice things and that would make me cry.  My mom and I always say, just be mean, cause we hate being sad.  I know Jo and I were mean to eachother and I can deal with that.   Mean doesn't stick around like sad does .    Weird, cause when Jo and I broke up, it was on the anniversary of my father's death.  Hmmm guess the mean cancels out the sad.  Huh, weird.    I don't really know why I am writing so much about him.  I guess I have been thinking about him a l
