Today I have to go to Birmingham for my eye doctor's appointment. We are suppose to schedule when I am going to have my surgery in July. I'm scared as usual even though it's not going to be that bad. Dad said that Zach could go with us since we are leaving tomorrow for vaca, but I don't know if he can. I ask/told him last night when I was about to leave then his mom came in and asked about it then my surgery and she didn't say whether he could or couldn't so I don't know. But I really hope that I get to see him before I leave bc I will reallly really miss him lots!! I will also miss all of y'all too!! ;)    Last night: I went to Zach's to cook. Liz and Brett couldn't come, so it was just me and Zach. We both went to walmart to pick up all of the stuff and when we looked outside when we got done it was a pouring down rain. So we ran to the car.. lol. We both got soaked. We got home and made the Jumbalyia, that was an adventure.. his mom and dad crack me up!! lol.. then we had dinner then me, Zach, and Wyatt watched Ace Vencura!! ;) Nice and very funny movie!! lol.. well thats all for now.. hope I get to write tomorrow sorry if I don't.

Well this morning started off kinda bad. I went to look at the list dad left me and Liz to do, it wasn't bad at all. All we needed to do was do the laundry, water the plants, and for liz to find her wallet. Well.. dad left some clothes in the laundry room it wasn't that much so I figured that they all needed to go in one pile. Well, obviously they didn't and I was wrong and I put them all in the washing machine and I told Liz and she got all mad at me. Well, I'm sorry it's not like I really meant to do it.. and it's not like I knew.. ya know?? I was just trying to help.. :(!! So, please.. *Cross your fingers* so it will all turn out ok.. Thanks!! ;)    Tonight I think I'm going back to Zach's house to watch 50 first dates with him, Brett, and Wyatt. That movie is really good. Last night kind of stunk though.. but I aint gunna say nothin on here bout it. Anyways, I saw Dusty yesterday.. I haven't seen him in forever. I really wanna go see the Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban movie really badly!! I'm leaving Thursday to go to Missouri and D.C. and I ain't gunna be back until the 16th of July!! I'm really gunna miss everybody!! Especially Zach, Brett, Queasha, Josh, Julie, Jess, Wyatt, Courtney, and Thrash!! And all my other friends since I can't put everybody bc it would take forever.. lol!! ;)
