It affects such diverse subjects as the visual and performing arts, new plant varieties, electronic databases, advertising, insulin producing bacteria, and video games. This course seeks to mix practice-directed material with public policy concerns. It will approach intellectual property as a regulatory system, balancing incentives to foster human creativity while at the same time seeking not to unduly restrict its diffusion. Since intellectual property is such a dynamic, rapidly changing area of law, many of the cases and statutes discussed are of quite recent vintage. In order for the course material not to become obsolete within just a few years, the organizing focus of the course is conceptual (upon the core doctrines of intellectual property and how they are interconnected) and upon directly confronting the question of legal change itself-how are intellectual property regimes evolving? What new judicial and legislative developments are in the works? And how should we respond?  Course Topics:  Although each individual intellectual property regime has its own subject matter requirements and standards for infringement, they share certain essential features. Each provides limited property rights vested in intangible mental products in exchange for eventual public dissemination. Some topics have been excluded, such as the intersection between intellectual property and antitrust, patent drafting and litigation, and (for the most part) remedies. These are addressed in advanced courses. The following regimes receive a more comprehensive treatment in the class:Origins of Intellectual Property Law Trade Secrets Trademark Rights of Publicity & Moral Rights Copyright Patent International Protection and the Future of Intellectual Property LawAlthough each individual intellectual property regime has its own subject matter requirements and standards for infringement, they share certain essential features. Each provides limited property rights vested in intangible mental products in exchange for eventual public dissemination. Some topics have been excluded, such as the intersection between intellectual property and antitrust, patent drafting and litigation, and (for the most part) remedies. These are addressed in advanced courses. The following five regimes receive a more comprehensive treatment in the class:  Trade Secrets: protects concrete information of economic value which is the subject of reasonable efforts under the circumstances to maintain secrecy. This protection is most commonly provided under state law regimes, and does not require any formalities. Trademark: provides for the protection of any word, symbol, or device adopted and used to identify goods and distinguish them from others. As established under the Federal Lanham Act, trademark protection may attach through use, although registration affords procedural and remedial advantages. Rights of Publicity: grants an individual exclusive control over commercial use of his or her identity, including name, likeness, and performing style. These are protected as common law rights or through state statutes. Copyright: grants holder exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, perform, display, or license his or her work. These rights arise automatically when an original work is fixed in a concrete medium of expression. As defined under the amended Copyright Act of 1976, the scope of copyright protection is limited in time and through such additional limitations as fair use. Patent: confers rights upon any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of nature. According to the Patent Act, a patent may be obtained only through filing a timely application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which will determine if the invention falls within the subject mater of patent, meets its three requirements-utility, novelty, and non-obviousness as a over the prior art, and includes an enabling description.   Course Requirements:  The course requirements include thoughtful participation in class discussion and completion of a three-hour final exam. The exam is quasi-open book. It will be graded for the quality of the legal writing and argument as well as for knowledge of the subject. We will be analyzing four types of materials. Two of these types are assigned readings: (1) intellectual property statutes, which may be examined in the statutory supplement; and (2) cases found in the casebook and course packet (those cases in the course packet are marked with an * in the syllabus). The remaining two types of materials will be presented through a lecture and discussion format, and do not require prior reading: (3) recently passed and proposed statutory material (described in the text boxes in the syllabus); and (4) what may be called shadow cases, cases which extend or limit the cases we will be reading, and which will be presented orally in class. Towards the end of the semester, I will distribute a list of citations for the shadow cases in order for students to clarify any points discussed in class or to pursue a particular personal interest. Students are expected to do the assigned reading in advance, and will be called upon to answer questions. Attendance is required.
