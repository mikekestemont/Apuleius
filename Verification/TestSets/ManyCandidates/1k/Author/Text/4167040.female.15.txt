Hello. I haven't really done a lot today. Just woke up, finished my book, talked to Jeff on the phone, did all of my chores, took a shower, and then Aaron called me.       I'm going to the lock-in at my school today from 4:00 p.m. - 12:00 a.m. so that should be fun, I hope...lol. I need to go in a min. and finish getting ready for that, I'm just waiting for my hair to dry so I can straighten it.       Yep...Well, I guess I have no more to say...although I wish I did. Hm...I'm listening to "The Girl All The Bad Guys Want" *Good song!* Yep...well that's it, lol. Goodbye for now!
Jeff...*rolls his eyes*. Jeff...*sits there with a blank expression on his face*. "Hi. What am I suppose to say?" Rachel says..."Tell them what we did." Jeff..."What did we do? I don't even remember. Shh..." Jeff tried to kill me on my couch. He was throwing pillows at me and trying to put blankets on me...he practically killed me...so yea. Jeff..."You got pregnant...Remember that happened?" Rachel says..."What do you want me to say?" Jeff..."Up to you." Ok...for the record...I DID NOT...I repeat...DID NOT have sex with Jeff...lol. It's a LONG story...but yea, I'm still a virgin...and I'm not even remotly close to losing it...so yea. No one ask about this. Thank you. :o)
I already registered at my High School...yay...lol. I finally got my locker and my classes. I get my own locker, so that's good...and pictures of Mike are going up in it! (of course...lol) Here are my classes...so if anyone has them, let me know!  Advisory (reading), John Thayer 209  Per 1 AP Human Geography, Tara Rigby E108  Per 2 World Lit and Comp PreAP, Betty Stewart W108  Per 3 Concert Band, Daniel Berard 221  Per 4 Intro To Chem Phys & Earth, Steve Vecchio N103  Per 5 Intro To Weight Training, Matt Johannsen 603  Per 6 Spanish Level 2, Will Allen 205  Per 7 Integrated Math 2, Andrew Wind E112  So yea, lol. Anyway...I'm going to the lock-in this Saturday from 4-12 and I'll probably go to the 1st dance, possibly, lol. Other than that...it's shcool, and it will probably suck like every year. Oh well...The sooner I go to school, the sooner I get to see Michael. :o)
School is going to suck soo freaking bad. I seiriously DON'T want to go back. Especially to Fossil Ridge...everything about it sucks. People always say..."Oh...it's going to be soo cool because it's all new." Well, because it's all new...no one is gonna know what's going on...they are gonna be trying new stuff on us, and all this crap...like I feel like I'm not even gonna get the 'high school experience' that everyone gets because I'm the 1st class to go through this high school. If I hate it after 1st sememster, I'm switching to a diffearnt school, I'm not even joking.
I just signed off of AIM...and said goodnight to my bestest friend, Jeff. For some reason...all of a sudden, it just hit me...how lucky I am to have a best friend like Jeff. We are seriously at the point where we can like finish eachothers sentences, no joke. If I'm trying to say something...but I don't know how to say it...Jeff can explain it for me, and I can do the same for him. It's sooo cool to have someone there for you like that. He's like my older brother, watching out for me, teaching me everything...he's the coolest and most amazing person you will ever meet. I just wanted to say how lucky I feel to have Jeff as my bestest friend in the whole entire world!
Hey Hey Hey! I actually had a chance to sleep in today, and gosh, did that feel good. I woke up at 10:00 a.m. and then read for about 30 min. I'm reading this book called 'Keesha's House' (I think that's what it's called anyway) and it's pretty interesting, it's written in a weird/poetic way. After I read that I got on-line to see if J
