I borrowed this from my favorite poetry site... It is actually very hard to come up with 10 things most people don't know about you. It requires much self reflection.     1. I am a Taurus, as stubborn as they come. This is good, in that I achieve what ever I set my mind to, but bad in that I would argue with a fence post, sometimes even when I know I am wrong...   2. I have moved more times than I care to count, but I have been stationary for 4 years now (time to pull up the roots and go)   3. I am a perfectionist, everything that I do, I want it done right, and not just right but the best that I can do... Not to be confused with obsessive compulsive... My room stays a mess until the weekend!   4. I have a butterfly tattoo on my inner hip area of my right leg... My best friend in highschool (god that was 6 years ago) drew it and I colored it. His only masterpiece to be on display anywhere    5. I have had three knee surgeries, and they said I will never run again, and that I may walk with a limp. (this goes back to #1) well the more they say "can't" the harder I will push. I have only been off crutches for three days and already I have almost no limp.   6. I have loved and lost, four long years ago, and he is the one my poems are still about. I let him go... He who shall never be named... I miss him everyday.   7. My favorite pass time is going to the gun range and tearing up the black bullseye in my target... (she has a dark side!)   8. I like chick flicks when I am sad... But don't tell anyone else okay?   9. I also love the rain, sleeping in the rain is the best, I have showered naked in the rain, after a day of fishing, at 03:30 AM... On a deserted peninsula with "he who shall never be named..." That is quit possibly my fondest memory. We danced while watching the lightning out over the ocean.   10. I am deathly afraid of spiders. I freeze when I see them, I can't move, then I can't breathe... Florida has huge spiders called wood spiders, they are the worst. They chase you, I swear they are all trying to eat me. They are big enough to take the can of bug spray away.   and for a bonus...  11. I was born with my ring finger, and my bird finger stuck together on my left hand.  Yep, they were separated when I was two.  They grafted skin from my leg, (my inner thigh to be specific) and now that leg skin still grows hair... How gross is this?  I shave between those fingers, just like I shave my legs!  Disgusting!  (I feel so exposed now, no one knows this.)
Sorry if this offends anyone, but this is my blog, and these are my thoughts!  Has anyone ever noticed that men are intimidated by women that are intelligent?  I am learning this as I go.  I really don't understand why, you would think that they would appreciate being able to hold an intellegent conversation.    For example:  A guy walks up to you in a bar, or anywhere for that matter, I mean face it your female, you have tits, (yes I said tits,) so it is inevitable that they will come.  But as soon as you open your mouth, it is like, oh well that rules her out.  Let them find out that you are more than a pretty face, blonde hair, and a nice rack, or even a not so nice rack, and wow!    Then I am told (by an older male friend) that I intimidate men, because I am so independant.  Well, since that is a downfall, let me just run out, quit my job, and become uneducated so that I can completely depend on a man for my every need.  NOT!    So let me get this straight, I dress nice for work, make enough money to support myself, am not a weepy emotional dependant woman, and have a high IQ, and these are all down falls, traits that men avoid?      I just don't get it...    These are the rational thoughts of the writer, not to be forced on innocent readers, if by chance you are offended by these thoughts, quit reading them.

Explanation: I started thinking this poem up the first time I saw the movie, and finally 8 years later I put the Idea on paper. This is a tribute to my favorite movie, a story of the truest form of love, yet not chick flick. Mel Gibson's  BraveHeart . Please let me know what you think...      A Thistle she gave him with thorns on its stem.  A symbol of love, a tribute to him.   His loss ran deep like the strong currents tide.  It was then he knew their fate was tied.   Apart for years, his heart did not forget.  After all this time, straight to her he went.   That Thistle he dried, with thorns on its stem.  A symbol of love, to her from him.   Married in secret, their love they did hide.  Only in God did they dare to confide.   They killed her to get to him.  and this would be their gravest sin.   He led his men, his sword held high.  With all his heart he questioned why.   His strength and courage held steadfast.  Their will for freedom had a massed.   He flung his sword unto the field.  Victory for Scotland, England yield.   He fought in her memory, he knew she'd see.  He died loving her, their spirits were free.   You see she was the Thistle and he was the Thorn.  And obviously their love was forlorn.   She was the beauty and he was the strength.  And they are together forever i
