RANDOM QUOTE! WHEE!    In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life. It goes on.  --Robert Frost (1874 - 1963)

If you have any problems, please do call 1-800-GET-REAL and my flying monkeys will assist you with any problems you have. Thank you and enjoy the flight!    To get things started, I'm Amanda. Most people know me as...Amanda. I have many, many names beyond Amanda. Such as...Big Red. Or Sno-cone. Even Manders has a place upon the names. Or if I'm in a bad mood, it's usually "You Bitch!" See? People answer to more things than one thing.  I am fifteen. I moved practically across the U.S. about a year ago. But it's all good. I'm alive and enjoying life and enjoying everything around me...except the nasty smelling air...DAMN YOU HOUSTON!! *shakes fist*  I am not your normal person. Heh, I'm much more cool!...kidding kidding...but seriously, I'm not your everyday, simpleton, plain Jane. No..I have a mind and I think for myself. And that's good.   I've invited three of me best friends ever to join in on writing this blog. I seriously doubt they'll all turn me down...well...at least I HOPE not...Caleb, who also has a blog. I post on his...hee hee. And Kista, who lives back in meh home town and who is the first person to introduce me to Achaea, and adicting MUD game. Aaand, then there's Nats. She's my one of my bestestestestest friends ever. I wub her to deaf! So, if you ever see a post that is somewhat sane...then you'll know it's one of those three, and not me.   Life is not as bad as it seems. Sure, things bad come our way. But they can't be that bad. Carpe Diem. Seize the Day.  I always see people groaning on and on about how life is too hard, too boring, or too depressing. I say, "Then get a life."  You should be happy that you are on this earth, with all its problems and all of its bad things...but there's more to it than that.   Yesterday in World Geography, our teacher was going around telling people what he thought of them. He loves all of our class, yes...but my teacher said, "Amanda over there...she's an angel. She loves and enjoys life, this class, and this school."  Considering I'm the class outcast to the students, that came as a really good surprise to me.  I got up in front of that class the first day and was told to give the class some information about myself. I remember doing that like it was yesterday.  He had some questions on the overhead projector. Some were "Where were you born?" "How old are you?" "What kind of music do you listen to?" "What are your religious preferences?"...I didn't mind a single one of those questions that he asked.  I stood up, being the first person on the roll, I had to go first.  "My name's Amanda. I'm fifteen years old and I was born in Nashville, Tennessee." I went on  to explain that I'd just moved to Houston a month earlier and that I had not yet adjusted to the place I was living in. I told them about the first month of moving...me missing my home..and my friends. And I told them that I'd noticed that this place was a Church town...and I assumed the majority of people were of some kind of Christian religion...which they were. I smiled and politely told them about my Pagan beliefs. "OH! So that means you can like put a little spell on the opposing soccer team next weekend so we'll win, right?" said my teacher kiddingly. They stared at me kinda funny and that sealed my exile contract. But, My teacher kept smiling the entire time I was talking.In response to my teacher's question, I brought up Karma and how I live my life by the rule of threefold. Someone asked what that was and I explained that whatever I do will come back on me threefold...or even more...depending on what I do. And that I'm finally over being so angry and sad at everything and that I'm going to make the best of being here.  He grinned and nodded and said that he's glad to know that someone as nice as me was in his class.   The point of all this is that I'm okay with being across the country...it's an experience, let me tell you that. I'm still not used to everything. Kids don't roll houses, they wrap them. And there are no freaks or hicks here...there's bangers and kickers. It's all so confusing.   So, a little bit about me... Like I said, I'm not your typical person.  I'm a weirdo who listens to whatever music you hand me...unless it's frickin Britney Spears...who I think should quit her career (if you can call it that) so that little girls would stop dressing like whores.  I'm a relative gaming Newbie. Ah, the joys of learning! But that's okay. I like learning! Whee! I don't talk like normal person. I use words like peachy, spiffy, nifty, oi, and woot! Oh, let's not forget the new word for today...Swell. I am Queen of many things. And I am Mistress of Flying Monkeys. If anyone disagrees, they are attacked with flying monkey banana peels. You have been warned.  Well, now that you know a bit that runs through my deranged mind, go on..play nice...and tell yer friends!
