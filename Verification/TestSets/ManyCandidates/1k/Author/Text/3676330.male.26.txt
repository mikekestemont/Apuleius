I have just looked at a few peoples Blogs, they are good, they talk about good things. Someone was talking about Peace, and interfaith work. I know that it all sounds nice, I mean who dont want peace and Love in the World, and who would not do all that they could for peace? But what is peace? Peace between people is good but does that mean that we have peace with God, and even if peace between people can be achieved, what will make it last, we all know that we are incapable of up holding the peace that we seek, we can look back over the thousands of years to see that. Or do we believe that we are evolving into super humans whos brains seek now to be good, and peaceable people? Have we let go and moved on from our waring and murderous ways?  I can see that in my own city that is not so, infact I think that people are getting worse. Our ability to make things and learn only intensifies our ability to distroy and be evil. People think that we are born good, but lets face it we are all bad, and do bad things. Peace comes with a price and none of us have paid that price, none of us can, it is too much for us. there is not a man on earth that can say that he has lived a perfect life, and lived  at peace will everyone.  Peace in not atanable by us. It will not be attained by religions coming together either. It sounds obserd to me that all these Ways to god can come together and live in peace and find God. Peace with man may happen from time to time and by this method or that compromise, but peace with God only comes in one way. There cannot be many ways to God. God is not in the habbit of confusing people and allowing them to think that they are going to heaven and yet not. He makes It plain and easy to see, to those who seek Him. Peace with man only comes as a result of having peace with God! And there is only one exclusive way that that can happen, Through JESUS.   Christianity is the Only way to God because the problem of sin and evil has been delt with at the Cross of Christ. and because of what He did we have access to the Father, Peace with God, and peace wiht mankind. All religion admits that there is good and bad, Sins and Evil deeds etc, and all believe that if you get rid of that then you are on your way to becoming Holy, good or even a god. But knowing the human race we see that that is not possible by ourselves, and God Had to do something about it, else no one would know Him or go to heaven.  Interfaith looks good on the outside but on the inside there is one problem, Jesus is not allowed in, because He is exclusive, He said that He is the Only Way, and the Only Truth, and Christians will not and cannot accept anything but what He has said. "christians that do have fallen away from the Truth and are in danger!  There is only one way to God the Father and that is Through JESUS CHRIST, I hope that anyone that reads this will take courage and ask God for themselves!

I just think that Life could be much easyer if we were not so bad at it. I mean, come on, all the bad stuff that WE do in the World, the hate and stuff. You know what I think it is time for a Change...what do you think?  What would it take to change the World, I mean, who could do it, Change the world. I guess that it would take some thing amazing, but not an external thing, I mean an event or a gig, or a tv show or plague would not work, wed all be the same, oh that is it,it is not the world that needs to change, is it?   No, it is us!  WHo is it that causes all the fights and killing and bad stuff...its us, you and me! What is it that needs to be changed, you and me? How is that gonna happen then? Self help books? More prisons, executions and the like? Will the creation of more rules and tougher police work, work? Druging people to keep them chilled and calm? I dont think that we have the answer...Humanity has a big Problem, its self, and no solutions...No hope! What will we do? we can try, and no doubt we have, religion has not worked...for many many year man has thought that if only he could be good, then life would be better and God would accept him. But alas It has not been so.  More later, Still seeking to see!  Love  Mathew
It is a day that I would prefer being in bed through. I watched the England Game!! what a match, I thought that we played ok, there were alot of unforced errors from England, and though we won I think that they could have played a whole lot better!  My Girlfriend is away in London for the next few days, that will mean that I can have some time with the Lord, Extra time that is. I need wakin up I am so sleepy, spiritually speaking.   A friend of mine wrote to me and said that all christians are Evengellists, and have been called to tell people of Jesus. I have not had much oppertunity to do  that in a
