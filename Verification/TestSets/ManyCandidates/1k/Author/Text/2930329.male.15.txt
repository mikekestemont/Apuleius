Dearest Blog, Today at school I have added A new member Sheila Hensley(Batteries not Included). We came to the agreement in Computer Ap. Today as in a Desperate attempt to learn Secrets. Along wtih the fact that I have been proclaimed with A new nickname Dicksmack? And Sheilas is Either "Worry Wart" or "Fat Ass"? I prefar Worry Wart because she gets what appears to be a lump of baby Fat on her foreHead When She gets Worried?! (LOL) Just to let you know how lunch went I felt very Uncomfortable? Why? I think it is because of Sheilas Boyfriend Justin? I just feel like in that situation I Cant say The same Things as I usualy Do? Like I'll cross some boundary that is to be un penitrated!? Wierd Huh? oh well... Dad told me that I am supposed to be Going to an Aerosmith Consert in Cinncinati! Whenever that is? I also need to call Lindsey (Capricorn) oh wait It's her Spring break, Duh.. As for people that I Either HATE or CONFUSE me todays Winner is Chris Buttcrum oh wait thats Chris Baucom? (sorry) See the thing is he try to imply as my friend, When in fact I dont like him because he is Racist, Sexist, and is an Asshole! And then I find out that Ronnie (?) is having to one of my Former Girlfriends Amanda who I mentioned earlier and he plans to go out with Jessica (Trusty, I think?) (Shiela dont you speak a living word of this to Amanda or anybody!) Because apparently Amanda is bored With Ronnie? Hey thats what happened to me Ronnie! That is why on April 15th 2004 Ronnie and I started the FBOAS Former Boyfriends Of Amanda Society! Neat huh? Im glad my Dad (Capricorn) is working Late tonight he is an Asshole! Not that he hits me but Shit?! Lay-off?Also, since It that time Again of the Year! (No not Lesbian Tuesday or Christmas!?)

Dearest Blog, Seeming how the school has gottan there hands a hold of you! I had no other choice but to delete You for my secrets would have been exposed. And to tell you about how my Day went It was so F!@ked-up! Why you Ask? Because I dont know why, My day started off as usual in its own Ritualized Routine that high school has put me On. I get out of bed after Saying to myself countless times " Just Five more Minutes, Just five More minutes!" Which eventualy turn into 30? I crawl out of bed and ask myself is it an A day or B day? B day of course which is my favorite day ( Dont ask!) I quickly get ready to go  by Consuming the always Reliable Bagel and Glass of Orange Juice and then jumping into the shower, And last but not Formatable Clothes and what I HAVE to wear (Dress Code) Blue Collared dress shirt and blue jeans "Great" i think to Myself "I look like A Smurf that has grown 6 Feet?", Put Gel in my Hair Which hasnt been done for 2 years, I make Shift with the look of a Metro-Sexual and I'm of to my Nieghbors house Candace Abbney (Cancer) which i stay and Commute with them for about 10 minutes 7:30-7:40 ten minutes Before the Bus Arrives which talking to Candace and her mom Tammy (Aquarious) is always an engourement Of communication. We then get out and say our goodByes to Tam. When we Arrive at the Acadamy of Living Hell (Pendleton County High School) I cruise the Hallways and think of What a pathetic Loser I look Like!? I then remind myself that This is testing prep week and how thankful I am that Mrs.Reed the Librarian has picked me to be In Her study Group. So I head of to The Library and set myself and my stuff down. And Cruise the Halls Talking To What Little people I know. (Maybe that is my downfall As a Scorpio?) Reminding myself that I have to live with this B#$lS^&t for the next 4 Years (As being A freshman Of course?) I then go back to the Library knowing that I have but only 5 Minutes and fall asleep at the table.  Amanda Wallace (Tauras) Wakes me up and Tells me it is time That I should get up and get out. So I head out to Gym (I hate The Class with A passion!) Picking my clothes up at the Locker... After Gym It is English ( Hate it 2!) But there is always Reliable Friend Shiela Hensley(Leo) we spend the class passing notes Back And forth about her and Her Boyfriend and that short dude (Tell You Later)   Eventualy Im at the Brink of Insanity and Shiela is dead And Im thinking about poking her with A stick to See if She is Still Alive? But IM saved by the bell and once again I am off to try to find out what the (Shiela and I call him the muchkin man) Hell Kieth (?) is up to by asking me these wierd questions about or s
