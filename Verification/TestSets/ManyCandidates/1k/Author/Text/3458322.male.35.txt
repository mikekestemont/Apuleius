I started a new hobby a couple of month's ago. I played for the first time about 2 years ago. Has a great time with friends, laughing drinking beer and just having a great time seeing who was making a bigger ass then the other trying to hit that little white ball. The same group of guys decided to give it another try sense we had such a good time before. This time there was a little bit more seriousness in the air. I noticed we were not laughing as much as the first time. I thought to myself, this guys are taking this seriously. Pointers to hitting the ball were flying around like we were professionals. Truth of the matter was, out of almost eight strokes it was all made worth it for that one perfect shot. I'm still trying to learn the game, but I figure a good start would be to look the part of a golfer. Bought a starter bag, shoes and even a golf brand wind breaker. Where I'm currently station I live about a good ten minutes from the military golf course. What luck! It's a beautiful eighteen whole course with a great view of the Heidelberg mountain. My next step is golf lesson's, for thirty five dollars for forty five minutes I'm sure to make the best of it. My wife likes my new hobby, gets me out of the house plus it sounds to me that she is starting to get interested in the sport. I can see it now, an old couple chasing a little white ball around spending quality time together. Life is good.
I went to register my son for an on post youth facility soccer team. I registered him and found out there was a waiting list. My son was probably 18 on the list that was growing by the minute. I asked what I could do to make sure my son could play, and the receptionist said "volunteer". I've never coached before, and surely no nothing about soccer but that the your ball going into the opposite goal. I went ahead and signed the application and went to my orientation where all was explained to me. Signed for ball, uniforms and a game schedule. Wow! What did I get myself into? I searched the internet for tools and even went to my rivals practices for tips and hints on what to do on at my first practice.   I was very nervous on the first day of practice, with 15 hyped up kids ready to get going. I tried my best not to show it, and even asked my wife if It looked like I new what I was doing? I'm glad the answer was a positive one. Getting off of work, rushing home and changing knowing there 15 kids relying on me to do my part. There were some days when I'd rather of been golfing, but my commitment was priority. It's all about the kids.  Over all the experience was great! I watched the kids grow in the there soccer skills and grow as teammates and learning to work together. The "Golden Knights" (team named by kids) had an almost perfect season of 6-1. More importantly, I was able to work with my stepson and spend some quality time. My first experience in volunteering was great, I'm really looking forward to doing it again.
I've just recently volunteered to be a part of a Battalion Road march team to walk the one hundred miles in Belgium. The 12 soldier team includes Officers, NCO's and lower enlisted soldiers in the Battalion. The goal of the team is to have all members complete 25 miles per day for four days. The team has been training for the last a couple of months beginning with a four mile road march, and working up to twenty miles weekly. The next step is to complete a twenty five mile road march then two back to back twenty mile road marches. The weight carried in the ruck sack is a mandatory twenty one pounds. Not very much for those who are familiar with the thirty five minimum weight limit for weekly road marches. As you can probably imagine, the twenty one pounds plus water for the walks get very heavy. I've learned to shrug off small blisters, pain and concentrate on one step at a time. I'm currently the oldest member of the team at a ripe old age of thirty five, but probably one of the strongest members. As a leader I show no pain, I am a leader! I take care of the soldiers on the team, and we will finish together. Nijmegan, Belgium, here we come!
This is only a test. A test of the "Blogger" site.
I just don't understand why terrorists feel that the beheading that they have been doing lately are going to prove anything? Do terrorists feel that the American people will fold with disgust and stand by let them do this? Do they(terrorist) think the American Soldier, Marine, Airman, Seaman is going to walk away while one of his brother's has just been beheaded? The feelings are very strong, and the subject a very tender spot in my heart. Could that person that has just been beheaded be me next? Will I let myself fight till the very end, or just freeze in place to be captured and then beheaded? Hell no! I am an American Soldier! I will fight with my brother in arms till the enemy has been brought to his knees. I will not forget my brother's and sister's who have lost there lives in battle. I will fight smart, take care of brothers in arms, and come back home to my family. Serving my country with honor and pride, I will "stand tall".
I'm writing about different cases involving law enforcement and civilians caught on tape breaking the law, but the law enforcement officers getting away with it. I will try to persuade the reader that law enforcement is being held to a different standard, a
