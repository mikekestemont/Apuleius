so today wasnt that interesting. just cleaning and being the parents chore bitch. the best part was that i saw my  brycey !!! yay. it was only for maybe ten minutes at the very most but it was the best ten minutes of the day. so i definatly cant wait for tomorrow because i get to fail my english final, kick major ass at my global final, and have a picnic with  bryce , angela, maybe travis, kayla, and maybe davey. so yeah after reading  bryces  blog thingy (and talking to him about it) i do understand about the whole trusting people when alcohol is involved. and since i dont want to lose him ever im going to watch what i do more carefully.  hehehhe donald trumps hair is so damn ugly. stupid rich people.  bryce  doesnt get off work for like two or three more hours and it completly sucks ass because i really want to talk to him. it going to be a long 59 days untill i turn 16 and am able to see him whenever i want.  forever and ever
lying here in a secret solemn silence
watching the pitch black insides of my lightly closed eyelids.
listening to the tears pour softly down my cheek.
feeling the bitter coldness creep upon me.
waiting for you to come, in the darkness of the day.
wanting your lips to touch my lips for one last gentle night's sleep.
holy god i woke up at 8:30 today. i slept at angelas and the f-ing sun came right into her room and to the exact spot i was laying. stupid angela got more sleep. shit bryce is still asleep. he normally gets up at the crack of freakin dawn and i sleep until noon or so. his mom even said she didnt know what was wrong with him. hehehe. "cause i do that."-oh angela...
JIZZUS!! hehehehe anglea is so neat! so im over at her house right now. my parents are freaking out because they think i snuck out today to see bryce. which is only half true. so i cant hang out with any guys. its so messed up. i saw brycey at albertsons. (he is so cute :>) we got into this mini disagreement thingy. he said that he oesnt really now what i might do when im drunk. and i got offended (dont ask me why im just dumb lke that) but so i feel bad now. after we (angela and i) left i was talking to her about it and she said that he does have a reason to feel protective about that because of my history of being drunk. but i swear i could never ever do that to him. i love him way toooo much. for ever and ever bryce!! i find it really hard to focus on other things than bryce lately and it sucks because i never get anything done. all i do is sit around and mope because i dont get to see him. mind my just doesnt want to stop thinking about him and how good he is to me. i dont quite understand why he is so sweet, but hey im lucky to have found the PERFECT thts right i said perfect guy for me. well peace out dawgs.
so todays going a lot better than yesterday. my dad is trying at least. ive been up for maybe 20 minutes and he hasnt yelled at me. thats a new personal record. i cant wait until i move out. things will just be so much easier. i hope i never treat my kids like this. omg! bryce got his lip pierced and it looks so sexy!! although now im gonna have to watch my back because he look 10x sexier then he already was so now every girls gonna want him. but they cant have him!
SO this is definatly one of the coolest things i've done. it's 11:51 and i dont want to sleep. So i have been thinking a lot and i have come to the conclusion that my parents are mentaly ill!! im so angry at them. I love Bryce to death but i ddont think they want us to be together. i really want to grow old with him which is really scary, but i really do. my parents just think that im some fuck up. maybe i am but when i finally get happy they tend to screw it up some how. i wish bryces family was mine. they are so awesome. i just dont get why i had to be born into this family
Swim through these waters
My lungs collapse as I'm gasping for air
I'll breathe you in (and I'll breathe you in)
You are my oxygen alone
Through arteries untold, your skin is pale, my body's cold
Way down, deep down in my lungs
I can hear our sweet decay
So spill my blood (SO SPILL MY BLOOD)
Midnight skies turn scarlet red
Say "so long," say "goodnight," and just hold out your hand
To catch me if I fall into the night
Say "so long," say "goodnight," and just hold out your hand
To catch me if I fall
Everyone and everything feels like it slips away
Way down deep down in my lungs, I can hear you as you fade
So spill my blood (SO SPILL MY BLOOD)
Midnight skies turn scarlet red
Say "so long," say "goodnight," and just hold out your hand
To catch me if I fall into the night
Say "so long," say "goodnight," and just hold out your hand
To catch me if I fall
Wake me up from this nightmare
Wake me up, I know that i am drowning in the blood
Wake me up from this nightmare
Wake me up, I know I am drowning in the blood from a pitch black heart
Cut my throat
Spill my blood
Pitch black heart
So spill my blood (SO SPILL MY BLOOD)
Midnight skies turn scarlet red
Say "so long," say "goodnight," and just hold out your hand
To catch me if I fall into the night
Say "so long," say "goodnight," and just hold out your hand
To catch me if I fall
