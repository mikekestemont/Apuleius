Today.. or rather yesterday was another day at band. what else would make me come here and write? =) ok.. basically.. we're now in the viewing room.. must say it has a weird-ass smell.. can't yet decide if i like it or not though.. but it IS kinda cool and the view overlooking the field is fantastic.. not that there's anything to see (it's only boys playing soccer.. and they suck!) but rather i enjoy the feeling of ease and comfort it brings. Had geog supplementary today, then band, phototaking, alumni, and lastly a nice chat with a few good friends. Geog.. voting day! Seriously.. if the choices they make are wrong.. we can be in for a VERY screwy 2 years.. and i really hope that doesn't happen. =P well.. band on the other hand.. was pretty much the same.. she even came up to tell me she saw me on tv! when i realised what she meant.. i was like >.
hmm.. i shall write allll about ac band. let me see.. the 1st day in band.. well.. acjc has a reallllly cool campus.. and i walked in up to LT4.. the band room. to my HORROR, there was no one there. ALL LATE! and i was waiting for like 10 minutes.. yes band pres also late!! =X annyyyway then i was walking around like an idiot when they finally decided to set up shop, so then i think they found me dangerous looking so they sent melvin -who looked rather scary then- to meet me. Then, with the crap cleared up i was on my way to play... the trombone! lol! if u dont already know.. i play the tuba. but apparently there are too dang many of em'. so then i get the GREAT beauuuutiful... twombone. haizz.. but.. the people are reallly friendly at band.. most notably my seniors. =) k la.. dun nid name.. both rawks! oh yeah then theres this girl.. shall decline to mention her name for now.. yes super nice! hmm.. came up to me to ask me my name, basic courtesy, but it just so happened she couldnt hear me.. some guy blasting on the drum set. so she mistook my name for..... PATRICK >.
I feel realllly happy today! actually.. i feel damn happy everyday! because.. theres no homework. well actually there is.. but heck! whos gonna care anyway! well.. its been a few months at AC now, met some really nice people, some nice people and some really good looking people =). haha although the best one is hiding in that mirror somewhere. ANYWAYYyy i miss my sec school.. especially my sec 4 class.. all the outings.. all the fun.. all the FOOD!! guess i hafta to count myself lucky for not getting into fit club YET. ohh.. today was gay day! project work. lol.. how can girls be so comfor-freaking-table with stupid crapola especially when it deals with GAYS. i mean.. can't we all just PRETEND to live in a straight world? whys we gotta walk up to em' gays and say, ''hi. are you gay? i'd like to survey u =) oh and by the way.. make it quick.. i've got a deadline to meet.''  >.
Let me intro you a little to humble lil' me. My name, if you haven't already fathomed, is David. meaning u call me that. and not with derogoratory terms that many people love to just because i'm so darned hot! literally.(ok the last relatively chim word i used will stay the last. hopefully. because cheeem words tick me off and more importatnly U MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND! =X hence cheeem =D ) yeah.. bloody aircon doesn't seem to work when u friggin want it too... >.  Sunday morning rain is falling Steal some covers share some skin Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable You twist to fit the mold that I am in But things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do And I would gladly hit the road get up and go if I knew That someday it would lead me back to you That someday it would lead me back to you  That may be all I need In darkness she is all I see Come and rest your bones with me Driving slow on Sunday morning And I never want to leave  Fingers trace your every outline Paint a picture with my hands Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm Change the weather still together when it ends  That may be all I need In darkness she is all I see Come and rest your bones with me Driving slow on Sunday morning And I never want to leave  But things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do Sunday morning rain is falling and I'm calling out to you Singing someday it'll bring me back to you Find a way to bring myself home to you  And you may not know That may be all I need In darkness she is all I see Come and rest your bones with me Driving slow on Sunday morning and I don't ever wanna leave
stop me if you've heard this before.. '' i haven't studied a single thing.. im sooo dead..'' well let me pain ur ears again as i repeat it over and over again. admittedly.. i loved my holidays and all the outings and trip over the causeway and especially the fun times in bannd. however it pains me as well to decide now that i am truly and finally.. dead. not only have the terms been creeping up slowly and carefully.. i have done nothing to ensure i do not get beheaded by it.. even now here i am gleefully writing about how im gonna die tml for my 1st exam. yikes.  Maybe i could, as before recount happy things that happened this holiday.  1)band concert- heckuva fun experience playing a 'foreign' instrument and making my section nervous as they watch me blow the place to bits. 2)trip to m'sia.. sadly missed t
