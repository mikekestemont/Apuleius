Yea, they stopped by peddling their crap up at the Prescott Resort. The first session was about 2003 Business Server stuff. (If you haven't noticed, my IT communication skills aren't so good). I did learn some basic maintence programs, and they did talk about sharing. So that was worth it. But the afternoon session went into C# program, and I ran outta there like a little school girl. It that an IT thing? No hell no. Better not be, I failed that class in college. I could do a little BASIC for ya, but it would be lame.  10 INPUT "What is your name: "; U$   20 PRINT "Hello "; U$   25 REM   30 INPUT "How many stars do you want: "; N   35 S$ = ""   40 FOR I = 1 TO N   50 S$ = S$ + "*"   55 NEXT I   60 PRINT S$   65 REM   70 INPUT "Do you want more stars? "; A$   80 IF LEN(A$) = 0 GOTO 70   90 A$ = LEFT$(A$, 1)  100 IF (A$ = "Y") OR (A$ = "y") THEN GOTO 30  110 PRINT "Goodbye ";  120 FOR I = 1 TO 200  130 PRINT U$; " ";  140 NEXT I  150 PRINT  yeah, now that was lame - and lifted from  here .   Well, still learning about how all that  outdoor recreation  stuff is working. Talk to you later.
SO I am doing all of this 'stuff' (polite word there) to increase our SEO, and I found out that at  IntelSeek.com  we score pretty high on recreation, trails, parks, and other decent keywords. This was the highlight of Kim's day I think, which is cool. Leah already said that no one in the world uses  IntelSeek.com , which is very possible, but hey, it sure does look good when  EatStayPlay.com  comes up at the top of any search engine.  This concludes my day. Going to the Prescott Resort tomorrow for training - will blog later.
Today's linkback count for  EatStayPlay.com  totaled a new record of 147. Not too shabby. Bruce said that on Saturday, there were like 60 visitors to the website. So the slow deatiled process of promtion has started. I am thinking about submitting  EatStayPlay.com  to the SE's like once a week. I THINK I can get away with it, since the website itself changes on a daily basis, ya know? If not every week, then every-other week for sure.  Oh yea, my Texas Hold 'em account to a bit of a hit late last week. I think there is $50 in it, but I did cash out $75.
I think  outdoor recreation  is going to be my target keyword for one year. After I accomplish that (or at least get enough traffic from  outdoor recreation , I will move onto the bigger things, like  recreation ,  travel ,  vacation ,  vacation planning , etc. But the term  outdoor recreation  currently recieves just over 5000 requests a day. " Outdoor recreation " can't be that hard of a word to target, I would think, because it fits  our  profile very well...like a glove. And if I can use  outdoor recreation  to start to generate say...500 hits a day, then I can think about moving on to the bigger stuff, like maybe  recreation  all by itself (at a whopping 50k+ a day). Once that feat is accomplished, I will work on  parks , that has to be the grand-daddy of them all, lol.  Took Friday off for Tam - her appointments are tomorrow so should know more by then. Currently working on a sitemap and an internal search engine. I'll keep you updated.
Got the news today that I will be attending two seminars at the Prescott Resort. Both are free (sweet) and are put on by Microcrap. The first is about Black Betty (our server) - guess they will give you the low-down on some of the main features. That will be pretty cool. The second is all about that XML crap, along with the SQL proggie. I'm guessing it will all be over my head, but gotta do what ta gotta do.  I was reading the rules for submissions at Google - they claim they can tell if your incoming links are from an FFA page (possible I suppose, escpecially when FFA appears in the URL) but they say it DOES NOT hurt your ranking. So I opened the floodgates there. Received 360+ emails this morn at the webmaster address. I think I will submit everyday. I ran a linkback checker today, and it found 88 incoming links, and that is far better than where we were two weeks ago. So we are getting there, that's for sure.  I am doing the State Parks for Utah right now, that will be our next release. Be sure to check out all the  outdoor recreation  oppertunities on our website,  EatStayPlay.com .  Current poker status: I turned $25 into about $240 within 2 weeks. I am thinking about cashin out $100 and playing in the tourney up on the hill. It's $25 to get in, but I will probably spend another $10 in booze just to keep my nerves in check. I hear there are 40 ppl that usually play, so we will see. Laters.
So after doing all these  State Parks ,  National Forests , and other  public campgrounds , I have decided it's about time I go to  EatStayPlay.com  and find myself a little campsite. I cannot remember the last time I went camping - oh yes I do. I slept in the back of a truck. Well this time is going to be different. This time I will be more prepared because I am going to use  EatStayPlay.com  before I venture out. By using  EatStayPlay.com , I will have complete access to everything I need to know about  outdoor recreation .  So work is work - got the green light to start Utah. NOTE: so like I was copying the popcenter from Black Betty to the pre-web computer, turns out there are two different sets of popcenters. Well, 50/50 odds, and I c
