Ok, once a week I'm gonna do a shout out to a friend of mine. First person is...Dez!  Dez, You are an awesome person. I have learned so much stuff from you. You are a great friend, and it has rocked getting to know you better this summer, and becoming a better friend with you. You are my best friend who is a girl. You rock. From "Red Dot" to "CrzGrl" we've been through alot. I'm so happy that you are going to West Ranch with me, even though it sucks that you won't be going to school with Wes anymore. I can't wait to be in ASB and Video with you next year, and maybe even another class or two. Its fun to watch Family Guy, Whose Line, and Futurama with you (Spot the Star Trek Costumes!). And, well, you just an all around cool, awesome person. :)

I hate how sometimes you think you have a really close friend, and then they go and do something really mean to you :(

On a dare from Dez:    A GIRLY-GIRL. You dont have a lot of self-esteem and people are always bringing you down for being sad. What do they know, anyway? You feel like youre too mature for your age and are frustrated by the trend-followers who refuse to accept you because youre not like them.  Your virtues: Intelligence, understanding nature, modesty.  Your flaws: Lack of social life, inferiority complex, timidity..    You might like this game, but maybe it's not your thing.  Take a look anyway if you are curious:  www.life-blood.vze.com    urlLink   What kind of girl are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

Saw Spiderman. It was OK. Liked most of it, but the ending sucked. What kind of bride does that to her husband? I mean, I've heard of ditching, but that was a little much. Anywho, my NexFlix movie should come tomorrow. Its been too long. I want it!
-Sean
Well, I'm off to go see Spiderman 2 with Tyler. Looks interesting, espically how the critics are split 50/50, with half of them loving it, and half of them hating it. I'll review when I get back. Also, look for some new features to pop up in the next few days.   Sean

Ok, its 2 AM, and nothing is on TV except for reruns of Family Guy that I saw 3 hours ago. Ahh....life is boring. Well, at least its a good Family Guy. Its the Y2K one. Woohoo. Anyway, I think I need some water. Later.
-Sean
Yup. Here it is. My First post of my 6th blog. Yay.

Ugh...I can't believe we have flames again. At least they are on the other side of the valley now. Pictures later.

Ode To Spot    Felis Cattus,    is your taxonomic nomenclature,   an endothermic quadruped carnivorous by nature?    Your visual, olfactory and auditory senses   contribute to your hunting skills, and natural defenses.    I find myself intrigued by your subvocal oscillations,   a singular development of cat communications    that obviates your basic hedonistic predilection   for a rhythmic stroking of your fur, to demonstrate affection.    A tail is quite essential for your acrobatic talents;   you would not be so agile if you lacked its counterbalance.    And when not being utilized to aide in locomotion,   it often serves to illustrate the state of your emotion.    O Spot,   the complex levels of behaviour you display   connote a fairly well-developed cognitive array.    And though you are not sentient,   Spot,   and do not comprehend,   I nonetheless consider you a true and valued friend.   -Data    Sorry, just had to post that!

Saw King Authur today with Dez, Wes, and Shalini.    Worst. Movie. Ever.   Seriously, it was. OK, maybe not as bad as like one or two other movies. But it was still pretty shitty.
