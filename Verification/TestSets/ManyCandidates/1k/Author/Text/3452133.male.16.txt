My first blog, my first post. i'm starting this all by myself, so this'll be kinda messy.   My name's Jonathan. i live in the most  boring  place on earth, Singapore.   I had an argument with a friend on tuesday night. kinda guilty and sorry i cracked, and i will apologise to him when i get the chance.  I also pang-seh-ed Quek for watching a movie. Geez, i was in a lousi mood after losing to someone in Initial D.   I'm starting to suck in Initial D. i'm simply too far from the best. There was this guy using a level 17 FD Spirit, racing this level 13 Evo6 user. I wasn't really paying attention (was juz looking at his lvl 17 aura. BIG) but i think the FD challenged the Evo6 on Irohazaka and won. sorri for the ppl who have no idea what i'm talking abt.  I want to be a drummer in a nice, ambient pub. there'll be a really good clarinetist and a really good saxophonist, along with a really good pianist in a four-piece band, and we'll play jazz and swing and stuff like that.   The feeling after you play a song well, and you KNOW you played it well, is BLISS.   Played pool till about 3am. Classic pool is a nice place to play. it's just sad my concentration is lost in about one hr into the game, and i juz kinda space out. I was looking at the Grand Prix showing on TV. not sure where it was held, but the camera from the driver's view was "wah kaoz DAT's FAST". The bill (for pool) was kinda ex though.  I got lots of shit to talk about, bear with me. I somehow don't seem to talk enough when i'm with my friends though.  Must...Talk...More...Cock...  I really like my girl alot. She's this cute and bubbly girl that just brightens up my day when i hear her voice. I don't seem to spend enough time with her. Or talk enough to her. Her friends though... are interesting, to say the least. I think i have gotten off on the wrong foot(that's an idiom)with her best friend's father. Wasn't my fault, i cant stand a stranger scolding me. so well i fucking scolded back. i hope he's not too mad about it though.  Must...Restrain...More...   Roald Dahl  is good. His works often bring unrealistic situations in very realistic situations. Thinking that way in real life is not advisable, In My Honest Opinion (IMHO).My English teacher in Sec2 told me to read something, which i have not read till this very day. I think its something call "The Chemist".   Next, some nonsense.  When logic and proportion have fallen sloppy dead, And the White Knight is talking backwards And the Red Queen's "off with her head" And Remember what the doormouse said: "Feed your head. Feed your head."  taken from the last verses of the song  White Rabbit  by  Jefferson Airplane . i havent heard the song though, will d/l it. Speaking of songs,  System Of A Down's Toxicity  is freaking nice.   And now, the lyrics from  Wind , by  Akeboshi . No, no, don't read it yet. Open   and d/l it NOW. And sing along.  Cultivate your hunger before you idealize. Motivate your anger to make them all realize. Climbing the mountain, never coming down. Break into the contents, never falling down.  My knee is still shaking, like I was twelve, Sneaking out of the classroom, by the back door. A man railed at me twice though, but I didn't care. Waiting is wasting for people like me.  Don't try to live so wise. Don't cry 'cause you're so right. Don't dry with fakes or fears, 'Cause you will hate yourself in the end.  You say, "Dreams are dreams. "I ain't gonna play the fool anymore." You say, "'Cause I still got my soul."  Take your time, baby, your blood needs slowing down. Breach your soul to reach yourself before you gloom. Reflection of fear makes shadows of nothing, shadows of nothing.  You still are blind, if you see a winding road, 'Cause there's always a straight way to the point you see.  Don't try to live so wise. Don't cry 'cause you're so right. Don't dry with fakes or fears, 'Cause you will hate yourself in the end.  This song is the first ending song for  Naruto . Full of insight, if you grasp the meanings behind the lyrics. The english pronunciation is NOT good at all, however it is a credible attempt for a japanese. Even more impressive, if you take into account that he wrote the lyrics and composed this song himself.   Anime is GOOOD.   I feel like cycling. I guess tomorrow at sunset. Cycling while listening to  Jay Chou  is relaxing.   Sometimes, i feel like i'm just a log, in the middle of the bright blue ocean. i drift around some distance, i feel it, but its such a miniscule amount compared to the ocean's sheer size. Cliche, but oh so true.  During the times during sec 1 and/or 2 i used to take the really early bus to school. The bus would arrive at like, 5.50am, and i would reach school at 6.20am(school starts at 7.15. i really wondered what i was doing back then). The journey to school in the bus was really, really brooding and depressing. it was before the TVMobile broadcasting hrs start (it starts at 6.30am), so the speakers would play some really sad and mysterious music, of which i will never find out the title of any song. Really enjoyable.   Somehow i am thinking of the Australia Trip i had back in December. I liked some parts of the trip, really hated some parts. i really wished for Mama or Lychee to come. oh well, they had their fun in Cambodia, along with AhDog, Monkey, Bui^Gia, Gay(Ryo. wahaha) and Lucky. LOTS of photos of their trip. The stars in Australia at night were bright and twinkly (Orion's belt..), unlike the sky in Singapore. Here, its dark and non-starry. I
