In politics there are certain goals, such as a "balanced budget" or "energy independence," that are so lofty that any politician who promises them is talking nonsense and deserves the mute button. Something similar should happen in religious debate to people who talk about "Torah-based" Judaism.  That is the chimera Dennis Prager calls for in this month's Moment magazine. He believes it&nbsp;"could bring vast numbers of non-religious Jews to Judaism." Specifically, Prager calls for a "Torah-based Judaism which honors rabbinic law but doesn't deify it," which, at a moment's glance, seems to make a dash of sense. Certainly it doesn't describe any of&nbsp;three major&nbsp;branches of Judaism; all three claim to&nbsp;take both the Torah seriously, but take cues from it selectively and are inspired primarily by the Talmud.  Prager correctly cites several instances where&nbsp;modernity has made&nbsp;a mockery of rabbinic law: "I see no reason to believe that&nbsp;kosher food is rendered non-kosher because the clean dish on which it is served to me once had non-kosher food on it." Of course, there is no good reason to believe this. But neither is there&nbsp;any good reason to believe, as Prager apparently does, that nothing in&nbsp;the last 3,000 years&nbsp;- not refrigeration technology, or the germ theory of disease, or the&nbsp;use of more sanitary eating utensils - renders any of the Torah's commandments about kashruth&nbsp;obsolete. Only rabbinic law may be questioned, because the Torah is&nbsp;"God-based."  OK, Prager.&nbsp;The holidays will be here soon. If the Torah is God's law, and you're serious about following it, do what the Torah says you should do to celebrate. Take an unblemished ox or whatever to a kohen and have it sacrificed on&nbsp;an altar.&nbsp;But we don't have a temple. Nu? Neither did the Hebrews to whom the Torah was given. They were wandering around the Sinai peninsula, so presumably the&nbsp;slashing and burning&nbsp;needn't be done in Jerusalem.&nbsp;Local ordinances might not permit doing this in, say, Skokie, but you can always drive out to the country, which seems a minor inconvenience compared to ignoring divine revelation.  I doubt Prager will do this. I assume he will instead drive to synagogue (he doesn't believe the Torah prohibits that; not surprising, since the Torah doesn't contemplate synagogues, let alone motorized vehicles).   Prager, of course, is not calling for animal sacrifice, although presumably he&nbsp;would if he really believed in the Torah&nbsp;as&nbsp;the literal word of God.&nbsp;What he wants is continued second-class status for gays within Judaism, because that is what is called for in "3,000 years of Jewish teaching." The rules of kashruth he dismisses haven't stood the test of time, apparently, dating only to the sixth century. So he disdains Conservative rabbis who "believe that preserving an extra day of yom tov is more urgent that preserving marriage as a man-woman institution."  No wonder Prager is uncomfortable in any of Judaism's major branches - he is liberal on angels-on-the-head-of-a-pin questions such as whether chicken is meat ("though chickens can no more produce milk than fish can"), but reactionary on the rights of actual people. As I said, it makes sense at a moment's glance, but only at a moment's.
FOR LOVE OR MONEY  (Monday, 9 p.m., NBC 4) Everybody knows nobody gets eliminated after a solo date, so Josh agreed to pay $275,000 of his $500,000 for one with Rachel. They saw a string quartet, so at least they were with people, unlike the weirdly empty beach and casino the guys on the group dates went to. It looked like a good buy until the limo ride home, when Josh started taking dating tips from Pepe Le Pew. Rachel, the scandalized ingenue, felt "mauled" and sent him home, along with Rudy and Alex.  WHO WANTS TO MARRY MY DAD  (Monday, 10 p.m., NBC 4) The dates and competitions are boring. Let's just sit everyone down for coffee, bring in their ex-boyfriends and hear the most embarrassing stories about these women we can find. They took a step in that direction this week, bringing up two "bad facts" about each of the remaining contestants. Suzanne and Stacy escaped relatively unscathed. Marilyn, we learned, once dated two guys on the same day and was once married and divorced in the same weekend. They did the polygraph thing and all that, but there was no point after the Marilyn revelations. She was toast.  LAST COMIC STANDING  (Tuesday and Thursday, 8 p.m., NBC 4) The contestants' task this week was to pitch a sitcom to a focus group. They had two hours to prepare their pitch, which had to be at least as long as it took to come up with "Joey." Tammy Pescatelli won with her pitch of " 'The Sopranos' meets 'Mama's Family.' " Would she have an act if her last name was O'Malley? (Yes. It would be about her family of alcoholic New York City cops.) The ejected contestants came back (stop us if you've heard this before) and got to vote for who would go on stage. John got four votes and challenged Corey, and in a second vote Alonzo was chosen for a three-way battle. Corey didn't put up much of a fight, getting sent home with 7 percent of the vote.  BIG BROTHER  (Saturday, 9 p.m.; Tuesday, 9 p.m.; Thursday, 8 p.m.; CBS 10) Marvin put Lori and Holly up for elimination, but, judging by their joint bath, Holly had an ally in Jase. She might be the Yoko who breaks up the Four Horsemen. Even after Holly got disgusted with Jase's general obnoxiousness, he took her off the block when he won the power of veto. Marvin replaced her with Karen, breaking up the Lori/Karen/Will alliance. Nakomis got bored with changing her hair color and got a mohawk. CBS gives these people no food, but they have enough hair-care products for a Jessica Simpson world tour. Lori got voted out, and Drew is the new head of household.  NEXT ACTION STAR  (Wednesday, 8 p.m., NBC 4) Jared and Melisande went on a date, but their plans to become the next Hollywood power couple are complicated by the fact that Jared has a g
