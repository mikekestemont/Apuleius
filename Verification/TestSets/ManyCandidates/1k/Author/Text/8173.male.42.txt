urlLink Volunteer snoops coming to an ISP near you?

urlLink R.U. Sirius unplugged  We’re just talking. We have this vast information matrix through which we can sort of form these temporary autonomous zones for our mental activities, but I don’t see how it is going to extend beyond that.

urlLink Palestine plans "giant suicide bomb"  "Just you wait. The Israelis won't know what's hit them. We'll lure them all in here - you know promise them a big party or something.

This will guarantee the immediate destruction of Israel and creation of a Palestinian homeland - although there won't be anyone left to live in it... The plan is an absolute doozy. We can't fail."  via  urlLink Everlasting Blort

urlLink Strangers in a Strange World  ...what propositions that you take seriously might actually have the same epistemological character as Icke’s notion that the world is secretly run by shape-shifting twelve foot long extraterrestrial lizards? None? I doubt it. We human beings are actually riddled with superstitions, biases, unexamined prejudices, and flights of fancy. It’s just that we are rarely aware of how absurd they would look if subjected to rigorous, rational scrutiny.

The existence of a polar opening and land beyond the Poles... is probably a top international secret.
