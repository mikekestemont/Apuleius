•Mood: pleasant       •Music: Pearl Jam - Last Kiss   High time for an update I suppose! I've made some quasi, could-possibly-be progress in the past few days. Interviewed at the aforementioned Jewish Community Center, had a kickass interview for what would be a kickass job. It would start ft and go pt whenever I wanted/needed it to, accounting experience, no one there seems too imbecelic, and I could participate in the cause without...well, actually participating in the cause. So that's my number one choice. Then there's this admin assistant pt thing. Enh whatever, that would be okay, I'm sure I could function. If that happened though, I would hope that a pt accounting job I applied for today would work as well. And I got a call for something I applied for on a bit of a lark--a dog groomer. Yeah laugh it up there. Too bad it's ft, I don't think I can devote the rest of my life to that, and the main problem at the moment is  experience , and getting some before heading to LA. So that's that front.   Not a whole heck of a lot else. Saw  urlLink Jeux d'enfants  (Love Me If You Dare), I enjoyed it quite a bit, about as much as Eternal Sunshine..., which I found similar somehow, though I couldn't explain why. Larrett just refered to himself as a "stiff prude" on the phone, that's funny stuff. He's going to Flag this weekend, so now I don't know what to do for the 4th. No one here I particularly want to hang out with, maybe I'll go to Flag too and stalk my old obsession, or my ex, they're both there livin in the same complex! small world. I guess there's always crazy Ron.
•Mood: pessimistic       •Music: Dire Straits - Romeo & Juliet (bad, I know)   Why is this finding a decent job proving so difficult? I turned down a part-time, slave labor, work-out-of-a-home-office, set-up-my-accounting-from-scratch position today. The guy was an arrogant cheapskate but he did have one good line, "It was a halfway house and we're turning it into a bar/nightclub." I have never heard Scottsdale summed up so succinctly. Meanwhile the Jewish Community Center hasn't called me yet. How amusing would it be to work there? *sigh* perhaps Monday. I try not to stress about it on weekends when there's really nothing to be done, but poverty is so debilitating! I'm going on a date for food tomorrow, sinking back to old lows. Larrett didn't get his potential good job either so we're in a sorry state around here. Oh and my insurance billing is still super screwed up, even after I've called  twice.  Today I got a deliquent notice for $450 when I don't owe them  anything  til the 1st--and only $100 even then! Ahhhh!
•Mood: blank  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; •Music: Alkaline Trio - All On Black  Welp, Tender is the Night is finally finished, thank heavens! It was appropriately depressing. I might have to reread Catcher in the Rye next, as its value was sapped by my being at war with my english teacher at the time. Or I'll grab something new with a pretty cover from the list below. Things have been uneventful lately, went home to Ktown last weekend for father's day. How I relish leaving here! 5 months... Otherwise just been interviewing and crap. I finished this little project I started ages ago--too bad Al won't get to see it til August.
thursday, june 17, 2004     the story of neighbor bear   •Mood: silly  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; •Music: Donna Lewis - Now In A Minute    Third person talker guy has another nickname with Larrett and I, furry little bear, because shirtless...well you get the idea, I needn't go into the hairy details (ba bum ching!). So he invites himself in yesterday and I ask him about this woman who was visiting him last week. I was quite curious cause this guy isn't exactly hot property on the market. He doesn't have it going on physically, financially, or most importantly personality wise, thus this primped up chick in a 40 grand Subaru got my attention. At some point during his evasive replies he referred to himself as "Andy bear" which had us practically rolling on the floor, what with already having the bear moniker for him. Then, this guy who never asks anyone else any questions at  all  cause he's so self absorbed, called me nosey bear! So of course I adopted it wholeheartedly. I am nosey bear.      sunday, june 13, 2004     Slothy   •Mood: lazy &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; •Music: The Killers - Mr. Brightside   I've done absolutely nothing today. Have an interview tomorrow for a great job, just what I've been looking for. Perhaps it would get me going forward again--I feel like I've been reverting to the past lately. Not that that's all bad. Amusing monikers for guys have returned, except whereas before it was for people whose actual names I didn't know, now it's better names for people I see regularly. My roommate has been dubbed 'all over the place guy'; the apartment complex holds 'lone hot guy', 'third person talker', and 'schizophrenic foreigner guy'. But more importantly, I wouldn't have to scrape together change for Del Taco and watch my credit card bills amass every month. We live in hope.   In other news... Tender Is The Night  by F. Scott Fitzgerald is officially the slowest read ever. Not bad, but for some reason it's taking me eons to read. I don't even remember when I started, about halfway done now, but I must be averaging one or two pages a day. Saw Stepford Wives last night, it had all kinds of production problems and it shows. There's a major recurring conceptual problem and miscast Matthew Broderick's acting does less than nothing for me. John Cusack (originally cast) would have been much better. Not that it doesn't have its clever well written moments (the AOL and Connecticut lines come to mind) and Roger Bart is great, but overall, quite mediocre.      monday, june 7, 2004     procrastination   •Mood: a
