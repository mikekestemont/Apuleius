I have a new found respect for mothers. Yes, after spending 2 nights with a new mother and a 2 month old, I decided I don't know that I ever really want kids. I mean, I probably do, but geez...getting up in the middle of the night,feeding, changing, rocking them to sleep...it's a lot of work. Even me, just as an innocent bystander needed a night out on the town tonight to recover from it. Granted I'll probably need a whole day to recover from my lack of sleep from tonight, but yeah, I don't know where I was going with that. I just think Mothers deserve more Kudos than they get...and I suppose fathers too, if they bother to get up with the kids.  I do have to say though, that making a baby laugh and smile at you, is one of the coolest things in the world. Especially if it's not even your kid. It's like, hey, this kid actually knows you and thinks you are funny for sticking your tongue out or whatever it is you are doing. But it is nice when it's other people's kids and you can just send them on their way and continue your normal life. Something like that. This whole post is pointless, its just 2:30 AM and I felt the need to say something.
So I think I'm finally happy with my new blog page, for the most part anyway. Now I need to move all the other blog pages over to this one...that will be a task. Anyway, I hope to have the changes made soon.
Yes, I'm still trying to find a Blogger that I like. This one lets people add comments, so I think I'll like it better.  -mf
So I downloaded a new CD today (legally thank you very much). I actually just was going to get 1 or 2 songs, but the more I sampled the rest, I wanted the whole CD. I must say, it's the best $10 I've spent in a very long time. The CD is The Beautiful Letdown by Switchfoot. I've been a Switchfoot listener for about a year, but after listening to this whole CD, I'm definately a fan now. I've already listened to it several times through today without skipping songs.  I will say, my favorite song on the CD, which I just heard today, is a song called "Twenty-four." If you get a chance to hear it, you should. If you want to see the lyrics (the best part of it) then go  urlLink here .
Of course I do, why even bother to ask. Its my only pleasure in spending money at a coffee shop. If I'm going to get a grown-up drink (coffee or something like that, that is) of course I want whip cream so at least I can still feel like a kid and not a crazy Starbucks drinking Californian. But this blog isn't really about Starbucks. It's about whipped cream. More specifically, Cool-Whip. And a certain unnamed friend (see Blog below) and about half a dozen 13 year olds. I must say, if you've never had a cool-whip fight, or haven't had one for a while, you must try it. It's quiet amusing to see all this white poofy stuff go flying across the room and hit people smack in the face, even if it's you. It's even more amusing when you realize that it was probably the grown-ups that started it, but you can ask my friend about her fascination with throwing food (like whipped cream and green beans). What kind of role models are we?   I suppose it's only fair
Yes, two blogs in one day. I've had a busy and blog-worthy week, what can I say? Anyway, on to it. My crazy Starbucks loving friend is up to no good. Not only has she got her husband addcited to Starbucks now (which I find quiet amusing), but she's giving me cravings for it too. And she is feeding these cravings of Strawberries and Creme drinks. I think about it, and presto!, she's at my house or office with one. I think she's just tired of me picking on her, so now her goal in life is to convert everyone to be a crazy Starbucks drinking Californian. Right now she's 2 for 2 *sigh*
So, I guess I should tell you how wonderful the production of The Sound of Music was. It really was. It was at the Forest Theatre in Carmel, which is outdoors, and it was just awesome. The cast did a great job. The lady who played Maria did wonderful too. But (you knew this was coming, didn't you...) my only complaint is that she's no Julie Andrews...haha! Seriously though, she was a great singer, and who am I to criticize anyone's singing abilities, but what I mean is that she didn't have the gracefulness of Julie Andrews while singing. I mean, I obviously don't except her to be Julie Andrews (no, really, I don't). All I'm saying is that there is a difference. Some people are more graceful and flowing when they sing. And some people are just good singers. You need different styles for different times...the character of Maria just needs to be one of those graceful styles. And don't get me wrong, I've known a lot of good singers, and I've known a lot of graceful singers. I wouldn't say one is better than the other. The lady that played Maria was just a good singer. That's all I'm saying. And for all of you who would like to send me hate mail over my mere observations about something I know nothing about, please feel free to send it  here .
4 states,  2 Buddy Holly planes, 2 sodas, 2 airlines, 12.5 hours, 1 failed engine, 1 special security screening, and 0 Starbucks...what a day!  It started with me knocking on my friend Sarah's window at 5:30am, praying that it wasn't one of her roomates' window. A quick trip to the Monterey Airport where I hit the long line of people waiting f
