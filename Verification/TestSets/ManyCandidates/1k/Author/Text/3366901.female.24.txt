Well not exactly 2 years, 51 weeks I know.  I didn't want to do the math.  Anyway.  Yep, I'm alive.  I have almost survived my first week of law school.  It seems like a blur already.  I feel like I've been here for at least a month.  Things that just happened yesterday seem like they were days ago.  Here's what my week has been like:  Monday, 8:00 a.m.   Begin reading for first day of class.  Start with Torts.  Do not finish Torts until 6:00 p.m.  Eat dinner.  Start with Criminal Law.  55 pages of Criminal Law.  Go to bed at 2:00 a.m.  Do not sleep well.  Tuesday, 6:45 a.m.    Wake up, which isn't hard since I wasn't really asleep.  Feel sick.  Try to finish reading Crim.  Force self to eat breakfast.  Feel sick again.  Get dressed.  Leave house early.  Drive to campus, walk to class.  Wait for friend.  Feel really sick.  Panic about being called on.  Almost head to the bathroom to get sick.  Decide to get bottle of water instead.  Sit down in first ever law school class.  See little prof run around class talking about how important this first day is.  We are beginning our legal career.  How important our first class is!  He doesn't feel up to the pressure.  Cool guy.  Break for lunch.  Head back for Crim.  Feel sick again.  Crim teacher is rumored to be awesome though, so not as sick as earlier.  Crim teacher is awesome.  Feel lucky.  Make mental note to visit her office.  Survived first day.  Feel pretty damn good.  Think, "hey, I can do this."  Go home.  Begin reading for class next day (3 hours of Torts).  Eat gourmet dinner of PB&J and Kraft macaroni.  Go to bed at 2:45.  Sucks again.  Wednesday, 7:00 a.m.   Wake up, finish reading.  Worry about being called on.  Do not get called on.  Relief, although realizing it would have been better in the beginning when no one knows what's going on.  Although some people think they do.  They really think they do.  Be annoyed at this.  Very annoyed.  Worry that everyone is smarter, more organized, how on earth will I stay in top 1/3????  Call friend who just graduated.  Get reassurance.  Gossip.  Feel better. Try to start Crim reading.  Can't concentrate.  Try out library.  Can't concentrate.  Spend 3 hours on two cases.  Go home to watch American Idol.  And the Bachelor.  Feel guilty.  Read again, until 2:00.  Try to sleep.  Thursday, 7:30 a.m.   Wake up, finish reading.  Meet upperclassman to discuss Crim.  Get some real help.  Get his old outline.  Awesome.  Feel good.  Go to pointless Academic Skills class.  Get annoyed.  Regret signing up.  Hope it gets more relevant.  Read more for Crim.  Do not get called on.  Return phone calls during drive home.  Inform friends that car time now equals phone time because I can't be studying.  Decide to take power nap.  Phone rings 10 min later.  Return to library at 5.  Do Torts reading until 9:45.  Answer questions for friend.  Feel smart again.  Feel like it is getting easier.  Worry that I am missing something.  Go home, do some Crim reading.  Think about weekend.  Thank goodness.  Friday, 7:00 a.m.   Wake up, turn alarm off (it was set for 8:45).  Decide to clean kitchen.  Sit outside with dogs.  Finally post to blog.  Feel guilty.  Must return to reading.  I am too tired to think of anything funny.  After class today I'm taking a break.  No more law school tonight.  I'll resume that tomorrow morning.  There is a big SBA party tonight.  Should be interesting.  Hopefully I'll write more interesting stuff this weekend.  Just wanted to assure you I'm still alive.  And I don't feel like proof reading this, so if there are error please let me know.
I've had this blog for only a week now and I'm already slacking with my posts.  This weekend was nuts though, so I think I have an excuse.  It began on Thursday night, in Fort Myers for a wedding rehearsal.  Thursday night I came back up to St. Pete for orientation the next day.  I was at Orientation from 8-5:30, and then again Saturday morning from 9-12:30.  I then rushed back to Fort Myers to the church to get my hair done for the wedding at 4.  Sunday I came back to St. Pete.  Wow.  I'm still tired.  So here are my thoughts on orientation:  "Holy &*&^, how am I going to survive this"?!  It was very intimidating to me.  I have something like 80 or so pages to read before the first day of class (tomorrow).  Our syllabus for Criminal Law says "The reading assignments in this class are relatively short:  You should plan to cover approximately 40-50 pages of readings for each of our class meetings."  Since when is 40-50 pages considered short??  I guess I'm really in for a shock.  Especially at the rate of 10 pages per hour, which is an estimate I read in some law school prep book.  Also, the whole idea of being called on in class terrifies me.  They did a sort of mock class session at orientation and I would have have sat there dumbfounded if I'd been asked some of those questions.  It definitely wasn't a confidence booster.  On a better note, I met some really cool people.  We have 76 in our summer class, more women than men.  I'm not sure yet who the "gunners" will be, but I'm sure they will be revealed soon.  (In law school, people who always raise their hand and try to impress the professor are usually referred to ask gunners).  On a side note, one of the Ambassadors is actually named Gunner.  I found that quite funny.  One thing that really struck me was how attractive people are.  While there are some good looking guys, we have a large number of really pretty girls.  I'm not sure why, but that really came as a surprise to me.  Also, I must wonder what some people think when they got dressed for this occasion.  I don't want to post specifics just in case s
