This week I really feel like throwing in the towel! I’ve tried blogging to my blogspot twice, and twice lost all the info I typed.  I’m doing it in Word now to be on the safe side.  My last blog was a list of woes and grievances: to recap, my social/family life is hectic, my work life stressful, and my study life depressing.  I am also suffering spiritually.  This Sunday was the second Sunday I’d missed church to work on my studies.  I feel that this is bad for me spiritually and emotionally, and as I am a church leader, it also does not set a good example for others in the church.  If it weren’t for the Joyce Meyer programme every morning at 6, my spiritual life would be very dry.  As it is, I feel spiritually unfulfilled.  I’m beginning to think I should not have done this long-distance course;  maybe I should have waited two years. I don’t think I’ll study in the third term next year.  The third term is very tough:  My Grade 12’s are finishing up and I have all the organization of their Matric final exams to sort out;  at the same time I must finalise the Grade 8 2005 intake, prepare for their information evening, sort out the prize-giving etc.  I’m really downcast about my studies this week.  I’ve tried FTP-ing the webpage I made but no links are transported.  I don’t understand this because all the links work in FrontPage. I even tried Ants’s suggestion of .htm instead of .html but nothing helps. Even my postcard  won’t work.  I managed to post my statement on Games at 8h00 on the dot, but I’m not very proud of the effort.  I only worked on it ½ an hour before closing time because I had to stay at work late to sort out the ICDL lectures.  One good thing – I wrote my ICDL theory test on impulse this Saturday and got 90%.  Anyway, I’m really thinking twice about studying more than two modules next year. I think I must work in the first 6 months and take the last 6 months off, especially as I’ll be teaching Computer Studies for the first time EVER and it will be a lot of new work to learn.  So from a sad Odette  Good night
Hi!    This is another Sunday I'm spending at home on assignments. I've been missing Sundays at church to do these assignments and this worries me.  I have a leadership position in the church, and although my pastor is very understanding, it's not good for my spiritual life or my example as a church leader to miss church so often.  If I don't get to watch Joyce Meyer every morning before school I won't have any spiritual strength at all.  Work pressure is pretty high.  The Grade 8 2005 intake must be finalised, and the Grade 12 exam preparations must be completed. I've also got to select my matrics for English Oral moderation on Tuesday and get them to the venue.  My ICDL candidates must be organised and encouraged to go and write the exams.  Everybody is tense at school because the year-end is approaching and the work is increasing.    This weekend was such a busy one. The Matric Farewell was on Friday evening - and I'm so glad that's over so that we can concentrate on work again! - and on Saturday we had a huge netball festival at our school;  my name was down for making pancakes from 14h00 till 16h00.  I also wrote the ICDL theory exam at 9h15 and then shot across to Westering to attend a mandatory seminar by the chief induna of the Assembly of God church in South Africa.  After the pancake making session I had to attend a family braai because my nephew was turning ten and his mother wouldn't take NO for an answer!   Anyway, enough about the personal life. Today is the day I have to ensure that my webpage is loaded to Hagar. I've also just read the unit on games and I'm afraid it's made me want to throw in the towel. I just want to rest and forget that I've even got a long distance course to follow.  So far I've managed to linke currency convertor and translator, and I've managed to get a free floating object going through the page (I still can't make it click to reveal a motivational message, though).  Today I need to finalise all of that and start on my Games module. These journals are getting shorter and shorter, but if I don't keep up the record regularly I forget all that has happened and it fades into an indiscriminate blur!!  See you later Odette
THis week finds me in despair.  I have fallen off the bandwagon this week.  Everything seems to be getting on top of me.  With great difficulty I managed to create the Look and Feel Website but feel very dissatisfied with the result.  Spent hours trying to find a poll that worked / connected and eventually gave up.  I was very impressed with the work that some of the students came up with, especially Ina and Helga.  I'm glad Helga won, as she obviously took a great deal of time and effort to make her design truly representative and metaphorical.  I'm sure all her links will work, too!  My next challenge is to create this webpage about Brazil.  As Brazil won the world cup last year I feel a great pressure to do something good!  Unfortunately I have never used HTML before and don't even know where to begin.  I've looked at all the websites recommended on the Sources page, but half of them couldn't download, and I found some of them too vague.  Boogie Jack seems about the best and I followed a basic tutorial in HTML.  This is a foreign language to me.    I have never been good at "self-learning".  I need to be shown / taught hw a thing w
