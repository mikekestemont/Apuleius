Alright...last night I went to hang out w/ Jolenes bodacious bod and, of course, Jolene (who herein is refered to as Jo) And if you know Jo (and if you dont then just do what I do, and pretend you do so everyone thinks your more popular than you really are) then, you know Jo is a pretty laid back, as close to perfectionist as one can get w/out being one, kinda girl. (with a killer ass to boot) Well, let me paint the picture for ya. Give you the 411. Give you the senario. Tell you what happened. (now that Im out analogies for that Ill get to the point) Ok, well, all last night Jo continued to do things that she would never do, such as, A) mispronounce and misread words that should have been very easy for her. Ex. mistake the word tampon for condom? (that was weird Jo, seriously) B) randomly "zone out" and tell the person talking to her that she wasnt listening and that they needed to repeat themselves. (it was kind of aggrivating to have to repeat every other thing I said to the woman) and finally C) laugh at every dumbass thing I had to say and eventually kill it (I mean I know Im funny but sheesh) So, being in this situation, I thought, "well, maybe shes drunk, or high, or a combonation of the two" but Jo assured me that nothing could be further from the truth. (I didnt and still dont beleive her) So, naturally being me I (for lack of a better word or phrase) "tried to get in her pants" (Ok, fine, its true. I was trying to get in her pants but what can you do?...lol...j/k) But, since shes Jo, and Im (for lack of a better phrase because of the language/phrase restrictions on this site) "Dan" nothing I tried worked, and so I left Jo's learning a very valuable lesson. Even when Jo is high/drunk/high and drunk, shes still on her toes and that I will never get laid so....I think Im just gonna go kill myself and if you feel you can save me, go ahead and try.....in gods name we pray-Amen P.S._____if your not Jo, and your trying to save me, dont waste you breath, only her sexy, bodacious bod can save me now.
Alright, heres my senario...Justin and I went on vacation w/ his parents for a week to arkansas and found that there are nothing but imbreds there...and you can tell who is and isn't imbred by the amount of hicken accent in their voice. Not only were we surrounded by hicks and imbreds all week but we found that we do not feel we should sin anymore, and heres why. The complex was completly idle to anything and everything, so in order to do anything you had to drive anywhere from half an hour to an hour to do something so Justin and I spent the week working out, playing pool, and sitting in the sauna. If you ever been in a sauna youll understand but otherwise youll be completely lost. (not really,&nbsp;I just like to say things so your like "then why the hell am&nbsp;I reading this?) When you sit in a sauna all you can do is think about how hot it is, but you dont want to&nbsp;get out because then your considered the weakest person in there and you dont want that, no no. So you sit in the sauna for more than half an hour until Justin and I both look at each other and say, simaltaniously "Damn, its hot, lets get the hell out of here" and so we leave. If a sauna is anything compared to hell then I shall no longer commit any sins or be a bad person. (we all know thats not true, I can't live w/out making the occasional smart ass comment, or being just plain mean to Justins girlfriend) But,&nbsp;I figure that if i can sit in a sauna for half an hour and then, eventually get used to it,&nbsp;I can do the same in hell. (I know its a horrible thing to say, and I'm willing to bet that many of you will tell me I'm not going to hell because all in all im a decent person, but if you really think about it, its true....I've earned myself a one way ticket to hell years ago and since no one at the front desk will refund my money I'm kinda stuck w/ the ticket and thus I'm going to go to hell and get my moneys worth) In gods name we pray...amen
Ok...in this entry im suppose to apologize to Justins Wench (who herein is reinstated as Barbara Lee*Ann Walker)(yes, i know i mispelled Lee but i dont care because I'm going to spell it how I wanna on my blogger, so take that)So, for the record I'm writting this to apologize to Barbara, so here goes. I'm sorry, I love you barbara, but my love for you is separated by a fine line drawn by Justin, and since hes not good at a lot of things the line is kinda crooked, and not very straight, maybe a little wavy, and you can tell where he lifted his pencil to take a short break. And so I go out of my way to find those small gaps and squeeze through them so I can make fun of you, but I always forget how helpless you are. Your like a little midget trying to reach for something thats on top of the fridge and you can't find your long stick anywhere, so you cant do anything about it until someone tall comes along and gets it for you, but since your a midget you know no one is coming and you begin to accept your fate as being screwed for the rest of your life. And for this, Barbarbara, I am sorry. But, honestly, do you think im so cold hearted that I would seriously go out of my way t
