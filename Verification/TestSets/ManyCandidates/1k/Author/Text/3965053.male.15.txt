if you've played  prince of persia  (if you have not,  i don't know how you're still functioning as a human being), you know that the music from the game is quite exceptional and can make you downright emotional when you remember all those cutscenes and puzzles and battles and romance and - i'm getting worked up right now.    if you're up for the 65mb, here is the zip file containing all 14 in-game tracks.  urlLink http://www.teapartydreams.com/modules/Downloads/downloadfiles/PrinceOfPersia.zip    wow, those are good times.   wow, those are good times factor ..::.. 100% out of 10
with  ninja gaiden 's  xbox-live  only, totally free&nbsp;expansion coming in early august, along with the&nbsp;second  master ninja tournament ,  tomonobu itagaki  - the creator of the game - is doing plenty of interviews and other press-related events with giddy and anxious game journalists. most of these&nbsp;meetings have&nbsp;established what will come with the pack - new camera system, two new costumes, new enemies, a new weapon, and an "action system". but  ign.com 's   interview had the single greatest question and answer i have ever seen for  ninja gaiden.   &nbsp;   "IGN : What do you say to those lesser gamers who complain that  Ninja Gaiden  is too hard?  &nbsp;   Itagaki : Just fight instead of complaining." -  urlLink www.ign.com   &nbsp;  yes!&nbsp;excellent! how very frank and well-said,  tomonobu-san . that really does sum up every feeling i've had about those complainers out there. so simple, and so true. just stop complaining and play the game intelligently.  &nbsp;     battles  is four guys making music. no genre to slide them comfortably into, no "you'll like them if you like _____", this is just tremendous music. using equal parts standard instruments and crazy electronic gadgets, the stuff that these guys crank out is so good, so fresh and unique, you almost want to buy a whole new stereo system because you owe their ep,  ep c , more respect.&nbsp;or something like that. the only way i can explain what this cd is like is to dissect it track by track.  &nbsp;   1 ..::.. B + T   starts with a simple melody and builds on it with the occasional, fiery bursts of volume as the track runs it's six minute duration.   2 ..::.. UW   a spaced-out and pretty trippy collection of noises and beats that are&nbsp;ultimately an intro to track three.   3 ..::.. HI/LO   the longest song on the cd. listen as&nbsp;beats and melodies evolve from seemingly random noises, only to&nbsp;grow and change and build, calm back down again, build again - it's just fantastic.   4 ..::.. IPT-2   the shortest song on the cd. don't even try to dance or nod your head to this one. it's almost  squarepusher -like in it's speedy and pounding beat.   5 ..::.. TRAS2   this is a great example of this band's magic. it seems as though this amazing song just evolves, like they're making it&nbsp;almost subconsciously and it's just growing.  &nbsp;  while i was hoping for an all out, insan-o climax to the cd instead of the odd drum solo, i still recommend&nbsp; ep c &nbsp;for anyone looking for interesting and cool new music.&nbsp; check them out at  urlLink www.bttls.com   &nbsp;  sounds like ..::.. um... well... yeah... hmm... favorite tracks ..::.. all of them&nbsp; &nbsp;
a.c. newman 's cd  the slow wonder  is good. it's really good. it's close the blinds, turn it up, and dance around and knock stuff over good. chock full of sing-along-ability and high-energy pop melodies, it's just too much fun to miss out on. if you must,  urlLink http://acnewman.net/  let's you hear some of the good stuff , but if you're craving charming and just plain ingenious pop, you should head out and buy it right now.  sounds like ..::.. new pornographers (duh) with his own magic touch sing-along factor ..::.. 10 out of 10 favorite tracks ..::.. 1,2,3,6,9,10,11     gungrave: beyond the grave  is the first release from the  gungrave anime series , which is being made from a manga and a... well... a videogame.  wait, please don't stop reading.  because, from what i've seen in the four introductory episodes, i only have good things to say about this series from the creator of  trigun.  now, before you get any crazy ideas from that, this is no  trigun . it's much more mature and gritty. episode one pulls you i
