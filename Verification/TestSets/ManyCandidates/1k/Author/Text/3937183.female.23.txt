Hi guys, been a long while since I last write but the fact is I am really damn lazy to write because I have so many things on hand. Gotta go bathe now because my project mate coming over to pick me up... Well, there is a lot of weird things happening to me now... I will find a day when I am not so lazy and relate every single fucking shit to all of you ya! &nbsp; For now, hope Yvonne is doing ok at her new work place. Can't wait to see Lauras' first article and also, Sugarfly and her new hp fetish! Cheers to all! &nbsp; Kisskiss!
PERIOD AND PAIN! &nbsp; &nbsp; I cried a lot again... For Shamus, for us. I miss him a lot. I love him a lot too I believe. I gave him up. I felt horrible.... The pukey feeling came again... I am so damn painful all over now... My period is killing me and my heart was pierced. Life still has to go on. I'd move on and so will you. Farewell.... &nbsp; Kisskiss!
MISS ME NOT?  &nbsp;  Hi dear friends, how nice to be able to write again! I was stressed up by my projects and best of all; I was made to do so many extra works! The group was impressed with what I came up with; a full 11 pages of Anger Management and now they want me to do Stress Management which was of course, not of my responsibility.... WTF THEY THINK I AM! CBCBCBCBCBBCBCBCBC!!! 5 people in a group and 2 did nothing as 1 is a fucking Malay girl and the other is a Chinese from China! The other 2 are my beloved Brother Liang and Sister Amelia who are busy with their Stress Management! They kinda lost their way in this project as they had been doing it constantly over the weekend but still not out with any shit… As for me, 11 pages of Anger Management in 1 day and best of all, everyone in the group sang praises… HOW PROUD AM I! KAKAKKAKAKAKAK!!!!  &nbsp;  Oh well, lets talk about everything a little here and there. On Thursday night last week, I went to Mount Faber with Von and Laura. It was very nice to be able to just get out and relaxed at a place that you fancy. I was happy that we could once again indulged in the beautiful atmosphere and the freshest air perhaps. Not so true though as I stayed beside the hill and the trees on the hill give the freshest air every morning… HURHUR! That night I recalled a lot of things, sweet memories and such. When I was still in Secondary 3, Von, Suelyn and me always go to the airport every now and then. Those were one of the most fun days. Always buy blueberry ice cream from Swensens and eat happily! HURHUR! After Mount Faber we went to West Coast Mc Donald’s drive thru and bought some nuggets and fries. Yummy! On the way home, we dropped by the petrol kiosk and I bought a tub of Swensens’ Ice cream for Von and Laura. Hope they like it.  &nbsp;  On Friday, I went to school as usual and after school, my group was supposed to stay back and plan for our projects. We booked a room in the library and discussed about how we should go about with the Anger and Stress Management thingy. Brother Liang and Sister Amelia went to another room and continue with their Stress Management leaving the rest of the group and me in the first room. I couldn’t work with that stupid Malay girl, as she is too assertive and she is one who talk the most, disagree the most and yet, did nothing for the group so far. WTF! MALAYS ARE MALAYS! I give up on them…. Jing Jing the Chinese girl aren’t so bad as she still does her research and her part but still I decided to do the whole part MYSELF! I can’t work like this, I prefer working alone as working in a group is time wasting and when our ideas don’t match, there are bound to be clashes. SICK OF THESE SHITS!  &nbsp;  We had team building to do after the project discussion and everyone are supposed to stay for dinner, somewhere some place. Jing Jing did mention she couldn’t make it for dinner but would stay for a drink a day before. When the clock strike 5.30pm, Siti came into the room and said her mum need her back home… WTF AGAIN! Always full of craps and excuses… She left with Jing Jing and I was like DUHZ. I joined Brother Liang and Sister Amelia in their room and continue reading my part on Anger Management. While doing our stuffs, we chatted a little and suggested going Geylang for Tou Huay! They were brainstorming and I gave them a lot of my ideas. Well, shocked to see that they actually did use my ideas as part of their part on Stress Management. We left at 6.30 as the Library was closing. Brother Liang agreed to get us to Geylang! So happy, we hopped on his car, a Toyota Corolla and went on the road but to our dismay, traffic was really bad and we were stuck on the road for almost 1 hr. Reached Geylang only at 7.30pm and were busy looking for a parking lot. Lucky we found a lot soon and proceed to Yong He Dou Jiang for our dinner! YUMMY AGAIN! Left Geylang at around 9pm and reached home around 9.45pm. So shagged man!  &nbsp;  On Saturday, I woke up feel tired and sianz as I have to get started and do my project. I had breakfast and was watching TV in the living room when I suddenly had the urge to play game so I went ahead. HURHUR! I miss playing games as I basically had lesser time to do so now… Haiz… I got mad at Darling in the g
