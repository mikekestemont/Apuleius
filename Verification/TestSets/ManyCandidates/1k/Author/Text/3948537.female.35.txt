You know what the problem with insomnia is? It's 3:30 in the morning so my friends on the west coast have all finally gone to bed and it's too early to wake up the ones on the east coast.   Why are they televising the Democratic National convention on every single major network station during prime time hours. I know it's only interferring with summer reruns but I can't believe they have anything that critically important to say. Let's face it, we already know John Kerry is going to be the democrat elected to run for president for the party, so why televise it? So we can see Ben Afflack use his Hollywood stardom to endorse him? again, don't care. Let Ben take his position at a presidential debate like everyone else. Besides I refuse to vote for someone because he/she is the Hollywood favorite. I guess that means I can never live in California again. Sorry Arnold.&nbsp;
I was under the impression that if you didn't appear in court when you were subpoenaed that was contempt and you would have a bench warrant issued for your arrest. Guess not.&nbsp;&nbsp; Personally I think the District Attorney should have a better case than a drunken drug-addict who blows off important court appearances. Obviously I had court today. The key "witness" was subpoenaed and then didn't show up. The judge was irritated and the District Attorney looked foolish. The chief of police (Barney Fife with a gun) left the courthouse in a hurry to find the person. Anyway summary of the day.... continuance until September and there are a few pissed off people in South Park. Oh well.
What a waste of a perfectly good week. Spent Monday in mediation. Talk about a waste of $500.00. I sat in the mediator's house while my ex-husband was conferenced in by telephone. After about two hours of discussion she figured out there was no way we were going to come to an agreement. I told her that going in but she didn;t believe me. Oh well she made $500.00 and I walked out pissed off. Then Tuesday was my birthday, so I go into work and my anal retentive manager who makes her job her entire life, fired me for not showing up at a picnic on Sunday. She wanted the job to be my whole life like it is hers. Well hello dear but I HAVE a life (even if it is screwed up). Of course my attorney tells me I have a good lawsuit for wrongful termination but hey, she is my landlord and I still ahve to live here. Whatever. Spent Wednesday at my attorney's office. What a joy. Being billed at $200.00 an hour to defend myself in a trumped up case where the prosecution's only witness is a drug addicted alcoholic who has been sued multiple times for sexual harrassment. PLEASE!!!&nbsp; The good news: The evidence supports my account of things. For anyone who doesn;t know what I'm talking about, forget it, I'm just blowing off some steam. Of course today was at least worth getting out of bed for.&nbsp; I had a meeting with the Eagle River Youth Coalition. I'm still new to this MADD chapter coordinator thing but I hope I can build the relationships I need to make it prosper in the valley here. And how was your day???
Went and picked up my husband's friend Dan from the airport last night. He has been in Columbia visiting his girlfriend. He brought me back some real Columbian coffee (picked by Juan Valdez himself, I'm sure)! When he got off the plane all he wanted was a "real steak and some real whiskey". I guess Columbia will never be known for it's steak and according to Dan the only whiskey they have is scotch. Not good for a Canadian Club drinker. But we got him fixed up. He also said Columbian's start their day with a cup of coffee and a shot of Algarrete Tequila. Definately sound like a place I could live in.. ha ha ha.   So Colorado passed the "Left Hand Lane Law" it is now illegal to drive in the left hand lane on any 4-lane highway unless you are passing. It has been in effect for two weeks and I am pretty sure no one knows about it. However they said on the news that people in the left lane who flash their lights or honk their horn at a driver who is holding up traffic in that lane will receive a ticket.   Questions is...if the cops are witnessing the situation long enough to witness honking or flashing, why didn;t they ticket the first driver for illegally driving int he left lane??? Go figure.  Thanks for the coffee Dan.
Today might not be the best day to write...or maybe it's the perfect day. My ex-husband is a jerk!!! A moron!! A self-ritious, inbred, control freak who suffers from paranoid delusions!! Of course if he wasn't all those things I probably wouldn't have divorced him. But he is and I did, end of story. It does make me wonder though... Just how screwed up must his new wife be to put up with it? Of course we are talking about a 40ish year old woman who is now on her 4th husband, who was never married to the father of her 16 year old son. I guess that answeres my question. Truthfully, he married a mother figure. Actually he married her because he knocked her up. Ahhhh the honor of rednecks to celebrate the shotgun wedding.  He and I might have worked out if we had more in common. You know like if I had come from parents that shared the same family crest, or had I come from a place where the total accumulated IQ is -3. But I'm not! I'm from a family that puts the word FUN in dysFUNctional (but at least my family tree forks) and there was never a dull moment.  I have mental issues, I admit it. I came form a twisted household w
