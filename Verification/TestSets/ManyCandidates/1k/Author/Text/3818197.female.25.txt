Funny thing.  I'm glad someone posted a comment actually asking on what my research is about.  I guess I have failed to talk a bout that since I started my blog.  My bad.  Let me tell ya.  The idea for my research came to me as I was leaving the airport on my way back from Seattle last April.  I decided I wanted to do some work based on the experiences of refugees based on the concept of diaspora.  At first, I was ready to go out there and interview everyone who has come to this country as a refugee in order to preserve their oral histories.  Then I realize how absurd that goal was considering that I only have an X amount of time to actually complete this research and have a thorough analysis of the cases studied.  So I had to narrow down and that was really hard.  I trully wanted to go out there and spend the rest of my time interviewing families and getting to hear all their stories.  So I decided to go by gender.  Females.  Then I decided Afghan women would be an excellent group to work with.  Then I spent a week in Indiana at a McNair Senior Conferences and ended up coming home with yet another change of heart.  Since I am a double major and I have an equal amount of love for both of the degrees I have been persuing (Spanish and Multi Ethnic Studies), I decided that it would fit both categories if I worked on the experiences of Cuban refugees in Idaho, more specifically in Boise.  For example, I'm curious to know why they have resettle in this area of the country as oppose to an are such as Florida or New York where there are thousands of 'compatriotas'.  Now, I have been refining that even further into what exaclty is that i want to get from this.  This is what I got so far: As a two part project I have set up to go on with the recording of the oral histories, I am getting ready to lear how to transcribe them so that I have a solid data base to base my reasearch on.  I want to explore the causes and consequences of resettlement and the effects that this has in these people's lifes.  I also want to go into the politic aspect of it and find out more about the role that both the government of the U.S and Cuba play in these people's life's decitions.  Or something like that.  So, at a huge glance, there you have it.
Last night a couple of amazing things happened to me.  I was sitting at home, actually working on yesterday's post when my hubby showed up.  He said we should go pick up a video we had lend to our friend Rifka so as we walked out he suggest that I drove.  I went back inside the house to get my keys and wallet and as I turned around the corner to get into our bit up 1991 Geo Storm when... BEWARE AND BEHOLD!!!!! He had gone out behind my back and bought a PT Cruiser for my birthday!!!  It is sooooo beautiful!! It is a 2001 Limited Edition with niiiice leather interiors and keyless entry and it has a cd changer in it... I feel like a spoiled brat (I know I am), but this is one of the nicest things anyone has ever done for me.  So, needless to say my feet have been several inches off the ground due to my absolute disbelief that this is our new car!  Ok, enough about that, what it's really touching and really relevant to everyone else, is that last night we went and saw Farenheit 9/11 at the Flicks.  I really wasn't prepared by any means to come face to face with the reality of war as described by Michael Moore.  And even less by the reality of what this government is doing behind everyone's back.  I felt good and bad because even though as I left the theater I had learned so much, I can't forgive myself for having lived in such obliviousness through the 4 years of the reign of terror that has been Bush's presidency.  There is only one thing to say to all of this: this man (if you can call it that) cannot, be re-elected.  I feel I need to go bang on the INS's door and demand a citizenship just so I can go out and vote in November.  This country can't afford another year with this government. Is just not right. It hasn't been from day one, but it is still salvagable.  I guess I'm just in awe of how ignorant the general public truly is about what goes on at the higher levels of the government.  It makes sense that they keep us so busy looking at add and getting us to buy everything under the sun or keep us petrified with their ups and downs in the country's security levels.  By the way, yes, I did feel like an ass getting into our new car and driving home after such a compelling documentary.   I'm at a loss of words.
So... here I am.  After reading most of Marcy's and Echo's postings of their intrepid adventures in Egypt I couldn't help but to want my very own blog.  Now, I am not off into any adventure this summer, so it took me about three weeks to figure out why exactly I needed to have this blog.  I have been, however, quite busy trying to put together a research project that has taken a huge amount of my energy in the past 5 weeks and it is a totally new experience for me.  So I decided, why not a blog where I can rant on about my frustrations and gains through the process of researching, or better yet, learning to reseach? And so, I figure I can justify my very own blog in the fact that I am going to drive m
