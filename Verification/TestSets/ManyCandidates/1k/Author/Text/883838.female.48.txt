A long long time ago, I wanted to save lives, help people, and generally be a hero. I became a nurse. What I found out is that sometimes it isn’t in a person’s best interest to save his/her life; that what I see as “help” is sometimes not at all what a person wants or needs; and that being a hero is vastly overrated.   However, I am still a nurse. In fact, I have been back to school enough times that I am now a nurse practitioner. I work in a rural practice in South Georgia where I have learned what I love best in my chosen profession: sewing people up.   On a typical day I may treat high blood pressure, innumerable runny noses, and explain to a diabetic that even though he eats no sugar at all, the gallons of sweet tea he is DRINKING affects his blood sugar adversely. I have had to discuss the possible source of a sexually transmitted disease with a woman who is having  sex with only one man. (“He doesn’t have sex with anyone else either -- except his wife...”) I have had to deny a prescription for vicodin to an angry teen who wants the narcotic for the headaches he gets whenever he has to go to school, and doesn’t understand why he can’t have it. I have struggled to get a parent to understand that her smoking in the house in her child’s presence has a direct and causative effect on the child’s asthma attacks.   Then one of the medical assistants tells me I have a laceration in the treatment room. Oh joy! A gaping wound, bleeding, pain with an observable, obvious cause! Something I can actually fix!   I sew well. My sutures are neat and evenly spaced. My knots are a thing of art. My scars are minimal and inoffensive. This is satisfaction. There are no cross-purposes to deal with. I want to sew, and the person with an open wound almost invariably wants it sewn up. The years and years of education, experience, practice -- these have made it possible for me to do this one simple thing I love -- sewing people up.
For someone in the health field, I have always had a large antipathy toward healthy habits. I am fully aware that eating right, exercising, and refraining from smoking are far more effective ways of handling nearly all health problems than drugs, but I have never enjoyed doing those things. But lately my favorite ex-wife has bullied me into walking with her and though I hate to admit it, it feels GOOD. I have more energy. I am losing weight. My arthritis doesn't hurt as bad and I have less urge to smoke. I feel so *conventional*. But it is rather like starting a retirement account; conventional though it may be, it will serve to enhance my future. Hell, exercise is even enhancing my PRESENT.   So, I gripe and grumble, and I do it.   Charlotte and I take our dogs with us on these walks. They become ecstatic over "walkies.". I wish sometimes I could be more like a dog in my overall attitude toward life. Simple things like walks and rides in the car are sheer joy. Hurt feelings are forgotten immediately when something pleasant, like head patting or ear scratching, takes place. Finding the exact right spot to poop is cause for total contentment.   Dogs have what I think of as the Gomer Pyle philosophy of life. I used to love that show when I was a kid. Gomer always assumed the best of everyone, felt like life was good, and took everyone's intentions toward him to be good. And things worked out that way. As a natural-born moody, broody, depressive sort of person, it doesn't come naturally to me to behave like Gomer. But carefully titrated doses of anti-depressants, meditation, and years-long contemplation of Buddhist readings have convinced me that Gomer had the right idea. Being simple is the route to happiness.
I am moving in less than three weeks. I wish it were sooner. I am moving from a deeply rural area to a very small country town. It will be almost as different as moving to a real city in some ways. Water, for instance. For about the last 40 years the water I have consumed at home has come from a well on the land I lived on. Not that I had to draw it up in a bucket or anything, but I have never had to PAY for water. I will be living in a house that has "city" water. This wondrous new home will also have city sewage. Cable TV (and MODEM!) Modern amenities.... And I will not mind never needing to have a septic tank pumped again. That is a most unpleasant experience. People who drive those honey-bucket trucks tend to be inebriated much of the time. They come to your house, dig around to find the edges of the top of the septic tank, then they dig the dirt, grass, and flowers off the top, pry it up, and expose weeks worth of your family's offal to your amazed and deeply offended nostrils. A large bore bit of tubing is placed into the mess and a pump turned on. The honey-dipper (or, more accurately, pumper) then leans on his shovel and waxes loquacious. The alcohol fumes on his breath are pleasant compared to those emanating from the malfunctioning septic tank. Do not get me wrong here; I do not begrudge a few drinks to a person doing this sort of work. I have more than once topped off such a one with whatever spirits I happened to have on hand. It costs $150 to have your septic tank pumped where I live. Worth every penny too.   City water should be interesting. Living with a well and a pump means if your electricity goes out, so does your water. And the power goes off with distressing frequency out here. Like every time it rains or the wind blows. I c
