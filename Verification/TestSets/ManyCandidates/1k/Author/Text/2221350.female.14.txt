Today was goooood.   mammaw picked me up from school early and we went and had lunch and i bought the stuff to fix up my costume.  my outfit looks great, it's a blue gown with criss-cross strings in the back and i like it. It's one of mom's old dresses that she wore to a Mardi gras ball. i had to line the zipper in the back with little safety pins and then string some yarn through the holes, and i;m not sure what I'll do about the halter part of it... Probably just tuck it in and pray, but I'm positive they didn't have halters in 1550, so i can't leave it like that.  as this whole monologue thing approaches I'm getting a little nervous. Not in a bad way, just the minimum amount of nervousness any normal human being has. I'll be glad when it's all said and done. But i do get to miss school all day. Except ((OF COURSE)) French, which is my last hour and morehead already told us we wouldn't have time to change clothes so I'll be in French and on the bus in this freaking poofy dress. jeez.  been talking to amelie. She's cool. She knows who metric is. i think she left me a comment yesterday.  ((w00t w00t))  i just dropped a crumb in my orange juice. That's funny.  i love orange juice.  I'm getting SO good at playing leads, you guys should hear me.
Yesterday and today were pretty much the same as every other day this week with minor xceptions that i will now convey in full detail.  Shane finally blogged and he's in love and i'm truly happy for him because he's a really wonderful guy.  Today i decided that i will be happy. being depressed and morose is fun and all, but it's just not a big enough challenge. i think a blissfull facade will be a nice change of scenery. and like i told heather, i may be dead on the inside, but people don't bother to look there and happy people have more friends.   Perhaps that is everyone in this houses' problem... nobody strives for happines, they don't make attempts to amuse themselves. which only brings us back to  the laziness of america and yahta yahta . who cares.  I finally finished my powerpoint. it was a bitch, and now i have to find a goddamn renaissance costume. if i can't make do((due, dew, doo?)) with something from mom's closet, i'll have to call the costume folks super quick. god i am such a procrastinator!
Ok i changed my mind. i can't do without blogging for more than a couple days or i start to explode.  I'll start with Saturday and work my way through this shitpile of a week. But then, do i EVER have a week that's not a shitpile?  Saturday was a blast. Me tiffany, Brandon, and Rick. We couldn't go bowling because all the lanes were taken so we went and saw cheaper by the dozen. It was a stupid movie, but the people i was with were a blast and we were wild.  so Monday was shitty. i STILL have finished the goddam motherfucking bitchwhore powerpoint project. It was a normally crappy day until mom picked me up from guitar lessons acting like a fucking idiot who dropped some bad acid. She swerved all over the road, honked at cars for no reason, would NOT quit calling Steven and yelling SONOFABITCH, and scared the shitt out of me. So after a lot of yelling and swerving, i grabbed the wheel and managed to get us home. She staggered into bed and when she woke up a few hours later she ran out of her room and said "DID SOMEONE GO GET CAITLIN?!". Well after some picking her brain we concluded that she was mad at Steven and her blood sugar was so low from taking too many diet pills that she doesn't even remember the entire afternoon. It was a really fucked up thing and she didn't even apologize until i squeezed it out of her.  so today i went into school and worked on my monologue some more and I'm still not done and Ms. morehead made me say my monologue and then didn't make anyone else say theirs. i hate her and i want to wring her scrawny wrinkly stupid neck.  I've pretty much decided that i hate everything.  so I've noticed that in the afternoons momma is obnoxious and stupid... Almost drunk acting... But she says she's not drinking...  you know, the only time I'm with my mother and she's not all fucked up is when she takes me to school in the mornings. That's before she's had a diet pill, a chance to drink, a meeting with Steven, or been to the tanning bed. It makes me sad.   I've decided I'm not going to capitalize my entries anymore((except for when the blogger spellcheck gets it)). It takes too long and it doesn't matter anyway.  so tonight she was being her usual idiot obnoxious self and she told me to go wash the dishes that won't fit in the dishwasher which really makes me mad because the ONLY-ONLY-ONLY-ONLY-ONLY job mammaw has is to wash the dishes that won't fit in the dishwasher and I'm so stressed most of the time it wouldn't have killed someone else to do it. So when i brushed it off and continued typing she came in here and clicked away my entire foot long email and closed all of AOL and it really makes me want to hit her hard in the face when she is so dumb and immature she can't even tell me to do the dishes without fucking up something in my life. But i DID do the bitchwhore dishes and i DID retype the email and she finally went to bed so i can be at peace. And YET STILL i am not at peace because as i was feistily washing dishes she said to me "if you kill yourself  I
