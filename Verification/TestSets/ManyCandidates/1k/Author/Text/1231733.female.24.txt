and speaking of quests, i often wonder when would the quest for the perfect job end?  =)
have you ever gone on a quest for something?  i have.  as a matter of fact, i think i've gone to a handful.  quest for the perfect ballpoint pen. quest for the perfect gel pen. quest for the perfect sign pen. quest for the perfect eraser. quest for the perfect iced tea. quest for the perfect garlic mushrooms. quest for the perfect fries. quest for the perfect burger. quest for the perfect jeans. quest for the perfect ponytail holder. quest for the perfect boots. quest for the perfect body lotion. quest for the perfect perfume. quest for the perfect undies. quest for the perfect sisig. a handful really.  and you know the most fun part of going on these quests?  it's not finding the perfect pen or jeans or body lotion or garlic mushrooms.  because if we'd find the perfect whatever, what then?  it would be a very boring consumer-driven life don't you think?
hmmm....  what to write, what to write...  i have so many going on in my mind that i do not know where to start.  i just read this article by joey ayala, sort of a comparison between manila and mindanao.  really, i envy people who grew up in the province, specifically far-flung places.  having grown up in a very urban area, being in the province, surrounded by everything rustic and countrified has always been appealing.  there is something in rural places which i find surreal and fantastic.  there is something about those really old churches and monuments, with the gray surface and peeling paint.  it seems that everything around you is deep-rooted and has its own mystery, its own story.  it's like going back in time.  like being in a dream.  like becoming a child again.
i got this email from an old friend who's based in san diego for four years now.  here goes:  "Hey! Mukhang busy ka dyan. Anyways, what's going on there? What's your gimik this coming weekend? Well, me, i'm kindda busy with work.  Nakakatamad na nga dito eh. War is closing in. It's probably on by these week or next week. We just gotta do what we got to do you know. Anyways, i really miss everything there. I mean alam ko we aint that close but we have our short share of memories. Short but meaningful. Take care nalang and keep up the good work. It's really good to see that you are doing great with everything. -- ERIC!!!!"  there's nothing really infuriating than someone who's so pro-america.  and he wasn't even born and raised there.  but funny.  it's not the land of milk and honey.  really.  sana wala na lang mga kanô dito sa mundo natin.  period.
another day, another... peso?  i just got my check for the first half of this month.  nothing could really perk you up than getting your month's pay -- make that half of your month's pay.  though i know that compared to my friends, mine's probably just half or a third of theirs, and though i am constantly wishing that my salary is more, even just a little more, than what i am actually receiving, still i am happy.  and thankful that i am earning something i could save -- and spend a little -- no matter how small an amount it is.
ten months after college and i am still quite mixed up.  i thought getting the job at 'the' newspaper would finally give me self-fulfillment. i guess i spoke too soon.  of course i am forever grateful that i have a job right now, considering that it is really so difficult to find one, particularly one that really suits you.  still, there are times when i can't help but wish i am with that freakin' magazine instead.
do you think i'm too old for this crap? perhaps, no.  do i think i'm too old for this crap?  i'm afraid, yes.  but what the heck.  i really don't care.  i used to think of blogs as stupid but then i realized they could be pretty practical too.  since i am sometimes too lazy -- and more often, forgetful -- to simply pick up that pen and write, i realized i might as well have my own online journal.  so here i am.
will be going back to work tomorrow.  *sigh.  ok, i don't want to sound like i am so full of ingratitude that i have a job.  i am actually grateful.  it's just that i do not know what to expect and i can't stand that.  working for this broadsheet has filled me with apprehension, uneasiness, uncertainty.  or so i think.  i wish could stop worrying and thinking about my job too much.  it's been in mind 24-seven, i even dream about it.  argh.
oh well, another long lapse.  can i help it?  i am now on a two-week break from work which means my days of free, cable internet are gone.  on the other hand, i am on the second week of my two-week break which means my days of free, cable internet will be back next week.  well, maybe.  in fact, i am hesitant to go back to the newspaper-with-balanced-news-fearless-views.  so i believe it would not really bother me if the newspaper-with-balanced-news-fearless-views would not ask me to go back immediately.  i really, really, really, really want to transfer to a magazine.  so here's praying that i'd get to work for one in the very, very near future.  *sigh.
oooh, artistic.  hmmm...  artistic?  yeah, yeah...
having nothing to do at work, i took this "what kind of soul are you?" quiz.  found out that i am:  Hasn't anyone ever told you that you're artistic?  Fair enough. Perhaps they haven't. But now that you know, you must become one with your inner self.  Virtues: You look for immense creativity and individuality in people, including yourself. You're not happy with anything less than brilliant, and you focus on being expressive. You value energy, liveliness, and upbeat personalities, but you're not supportive of moodiness when you y
