Hello everyone  Friday night was a blast at the WNS? CD release show. CountMeIn played and put on an amazing show. I was so happy I could share the experience with Ang and Dana ( You 2 Rock). The night went smoothly at the show and I hung out with the 2 girls and I knew a lot of others there too. If any ones looking for tix's for the June 19th Last Class show ask me for details.  Shatterday was pretty sweet aswell that night Corey and my self hung out with the       3 tequila's which was fun to start with but then it felt like corey and I were being left out of all decisions and conversations. That night I called both Dana and Ang to explain why we were upset but then we all resovled our problems and the 5 of us are looking forward to the great friendships well have ( What a summer its going to be).   I'm off to see my baseball girls in action so hope every one had a blast of a weekend like I did and I'll talk later or call my cell  MITCH

When we arrived we thought we would be late  so we were all running and stuff but as we approached t he cinema doors we realized the first show starts at  6 ( Thanks ANG :>)so we rush there for nothing. We had a few hours to kill so we went out for some dinner  but couldn't decide were to go because everyone had different ideas. We ended up going  to Burger King for a quick  bite. We went and got our tickets for the movie and got our seats. After many arguments we ended up sitting together but through out the movie I was bugged by the 3 stooges ( kayla , Dana, Corey) They were yelling  stuff such as "SEX" and  rubbing my neck and my legs. But the movie was o
