Believe it or not, I've made my move, relatively unscathed.  What a long, hard couple of days, though.  Is it Murphy's Law that people who say that they will help you move always seem to find a reason at the last minute to back out?  I was unable to get the day off, and so it was Dave and a friend with a horse trailer.  Yup..two people to move our worldly possesions.  However, it got done, and the stuff that didn't...well, it was stuff that could fit in a car.  Thank goodness!  BUT...now the daunting task..yes, unpacking.  Oh, how I hate unpacking.  I don't know what's worse...packing or unpacking.  The house is littered with boxes and bags, everything looks so cluttered, and I haven't got a CLUE where to start putting things.  It's so overwhelming.  My response to being overwhelmed tends to be to just sit and stare at it, and then turn on the TV..or in this case, write a blog.  In any case, my long weekend will be filled with boxes and the ever exciting NEW adventure...WHERE are we going to put THIS???  Anyhow, Happy Long Weekend everyone...talk to you soon!  -J.
Well, tonight is the last night that I will have internet access.&nbsp; For a couple of days, anyways...tomorrow, the computer is going to be dismantled and moved over to our new house. So, all of my profound thoughts will have to be jam packed into this blog tonight.  The weekend was fairly good, except for this stupid hot weather, which, if you've read any of my other posts, you'll know that I hate it! HATE it!!!!  We did some packing, which is turning out to be a bit frightening...we thought that we didn't have much stuff left to pack.&nbsp; Boy, were we wrong!!!&nbsp;   We went to our friends house (Jeff and Dawn) for supper on Saturday, which was really nice.  My brother and his wife were in town from Calgary this afternoon.&nbsp; They were at an anniversary celebration for her grandparents this past weekend.&nbsp; It was held in a town about an hour from Saskatoon, and so they came and spent the afternoon with us, and brought us a new china cabinet!!  And tonight, Dave went to work, and I'm sitting here, sweating.&nbsp; The house just doesn't cool off.&nbsp; At least our new house is cooler!&nbsp; Thank goodness!  But, my profound thought is this:&nbsp; I am truly thankful for all of the good people in our lives.&nbsp; God has blessed Dave and I with an awesome marriage and really wonderful family and friends.&nbsp; It's so nice to know that a support network is in place if we need it, and even if we don't.&nbsp;&nbsp; A true friend doesn't care if you pop in on them, or if they pop in on you and your house is a disaster.&nbsp; You can sit and chat about anything and everything, and when the visit is over, you feel refreshed and just really good about yourself.&nbsp; So, to all of our friends and family, we love you and we cherish you!&nbsp; Thanks for all of the support during our big purchase and move!  Good night and talk to you FROM OUR NEW HOUSE!!!!  -J.
So, approximately a week ago, I was out watering my garden after a long day of gardening, and this tiny, little kitty comes bounding out of the grass towards me.&nbsp; She was orange, white, black, and tabby, all in one, with this loud, whining mewl.&nbsp; And cute!!  Well, my  urlLink cousin , Janine, is going to be moving into our old house that we've been renting.&nbsp; And, she has a cat, Salut (I think that's how you spell it?).&nbsp; She has been pondering finding company for her, as she is sometimes gone on weekends, and it can be a long, lonely time for a cat.&nbsp;   When this little one came bounding out of the grass towards me, with no tag or owner, I immediately gave her a call.&nbsp; After 2 minutes of hemming and hawwing, she said she'd take her, if we didn't mind babysitting for a couple of weeks, until she moved up to Saskatoon at the end of the month.  Let me say this.&nbsp; It has been an interesting week with a new kitty in the house.&nbsp; Our two cats, ZoomZoom and Ruby, have NOT been keen on this at all.&nbsp; There has been much growling, hissing, and gnashing of teeth, so to speak.&nbsp; Callie, as Janine has named her, seems pretty much oblivious.&nbsp; She just goes about her business, exploring her new home to be, eating, sleeping, and tormenting her babysitters.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait...did I say tormenting her babysitters???   Yes, she likes to crawl up on our bed at, oh, say 4 in the morning, and lick.&nbsp; Lick, lick, lick.&nbsp; Lick the face, lick the nose, lick the lips (YUCK!!), lick the fingers!&nbsp; I try to push her away...she comes back...I swear, she could be a door-to-door salesperson with the persistence that she displays!&nbsp;   Tonight, I had to give her a bath.&nbsp; She was outside (we have a cat run attached to this house), and I kind of sprayed her a bit with the sprinkler.&nbsp; She was muddy, so I put her in the bath tub.&nbsp; Surprisingly, she did pretty good with it!&nbsp; No hissing or scratching.&nbsp; Now, I'm not saying she LOVED it, but she did pretty darn good.  As much as I love this little kitty, though, I'm going to be happy when Janine comes up here and takes ownership.&nbsp; I think her ears and nose need a good licking instead of mine. =)  -J.
To all you whiners who were complaining about the cold, rainy weather...Are ya happy now??? Frick, do I hate this hot weather crap.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Not to mention the fact that my husband and I have spent the past 4 days cooped up in our new home, doing a bit of a facelift...yes, I particularly enjoyed it when I was sanding plaster down, and it was sticking to my sweat.&nbsp; Perhaps it's a new beauty treatment?? &nbsp; And speaking of sweat...I never k
