urlLink    sometime we human ever wondered what is the term "life"? LIfe is a simple cycle abt born and death.. it's also abt the meaning y u r living on earth.. and u will askin urself y r u being born.. u r born to see and explore this world.. the word "life"  to us may sounds nth but "life" to others will seems to be sth special which lightens up their life and colours their world.. life is not short or long but it will simply end one day.. But does we sometimes do ask ourself in life why there's so many ups and downs.. do we have to face all these in order to grow as we learn.. we born to learn to love and also to know wat is true friendships and kinship.. in this world some where or some corner.. asking what is the term of true love, or does it exist? will dreams come true.. some one in this world asking would i be able to the the sun rise of tomorrow.. we do ask ourself lots of questions.. but the reason you are here.. there might not be a reason goes with it.. but u, yourself are the one who create the reason why u are living in this world.. u might not agree.. but tat's what i think... is life destinated? or brought by fate.... you will only have the answer in urself...&nbsp; urlLink
