im drunk.
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!  from a pretty good mood to a pretty bad mood geez i just typed up a 3 paragraph entry and because of my stupid downstairs internet connection its all gone... so sorry if this re-entry persay doesn't share the same enthusiasm as the one i had just typed up.  trying to remember what i was blabbering about***  oh ya its wednesday tomorrow meaning **dadadadum** FIREWORKS, haha enough hype eh, but honestly i think there a  tad bit  overated... not really in the mood to go but I WILL haha,, the one thing that annoys me about the fireworks is the marathon walking involved, lets say we go to 2 of the firework shows walking to english bay and back&nbsp;X2  &nbsp;i would say thats like walking from Surrey to New West,( or atleast it feels that way to me)  so ya good luck goes out to all you walkers tomorrow evening, cuz the next morning/s you will be sore and if your really unlucky you might just get beaten up :) j/k...  on the topic of special events i just realized that we are not good long-term organizers,&nbsp; i can't remember a time where we've planned out something a week or two in advance and followed up on it haha,, it seems as if everything we plan out is a day or two before it actually happens,,&nbsp; haha which causes some major planning cramming (if that makes sense haha) but ya i guess our short-term organizing style has worked pretty well sooo far  who else here is missing those&nbsp;crazy parties&nbsp;in the beginning of gr.10 (ie. choko's and tiff''s... more so tiff's for me haha) but ye we have to reinvent that theme we had going on haha.. i miss tasting all you girls' lips ;) haha... back to the basics: ALCOHAL, the fuel that starts my engine, the  liquid courage,  haha u know it, i was having this conversation with my older cousins and brother just last night, the term "liquid courage" holds true to its meaning, i swear all the Scarecrow needed was a shot of Crown Royal and all his fears would've been diminished... hahaha   just one more thing to mention...&nbsp;i have a&nbsp;Shaw internet connection between two computers (ie. wireless connection w/ router) and this downstairs comp that im on right now is seriously getting on my nerves, constantly logging me off and on on MSN, haha ye apologies to those annoyed people on my list.. and to top it off we called Shaw over to fix our problem,, and some guy comes over, and he has no clue of what to do... i couldn't believe this guy gets paid for a living, he came over and looked dumb-founded at the situation and i don't even think he touched our keyboard or mouse to try and fix it... end of subject, i've had enough already haha  imma boogy::   final note: please please pretty please can we recieve a boot my 6pm tomorrow

Oooooookay...   So the time is 11:53 and&nbsp;right about now, the temperature is 22ยบ. I'm sweating so much. You know that feeling when you're done from P.E. class and you're sweating so much and you feel all gross and stuff, that sticky feeling?... YEA! i hate that. It's so hot that&nbsp;i wanna wear a speedo right about now...a neon green one.   So I just finished watching 'Boiler Room'. I watched it 3 times today; its so addictive. It's unfortunate that I didn't get to watch this movie before i got into telemarketing. This movie got me influenced into manipulating people and being a corporate gangster, LOL..I guess being a stock broker ties into telemarketing because it involves convincing people. It's all about salesman pitch, straight business.&nbsp;However, now i can't do that anymore cause i got fired...haha damnit! ...&nbsp;Whatevah! it's the summer, let's get crunk.   So, with that said...  Let's talk about summer parties shall we?   Yesterday was Bj's party, it was fun. Not as much people as i expected, but still pretty good. It's all about quality, not quantity right?  So yea i slept over. It was my first sleepover since like grade 5 so i was excited haha. I was too excited that i didn't sleep and i ended up jogging with James to Holy Cross and back at 4 in the morning and didn't end up sleeping until 11 a.m. When I woke up I had the fattest headache and i've been popping advil all day. But yea, i'd have to give it a 9 out of 10, Bj. Hope u find your hat.   But yea...   You know who i hate? Spiderman. I don't really know why though, but yea, yesterday i came up with a theory. Spiderman's only cool cause he lives in New York...wtf would he do if he lived in Saskatchewan. Seriously.   Well im out, I'm gonna try and watch 'Boiler Room' for the 4th time today. I wanna go for a w
