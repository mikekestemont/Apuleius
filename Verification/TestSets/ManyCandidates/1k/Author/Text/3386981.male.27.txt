there are a lot of things that a man or a woman might want to say but cannot say them, there are various reasons why they are able to say them or not. however there is one thing any man or woman should easily be able to say, the word that comes to your mind when you accidently kick your bedpost with your knee or toe. Especially the toe, kick it just hard enough that a little bit of the nail is left attached to the more ably attached part of the anatomy. now after you wake up from your personal blackout you find out which condition your nail is in. for women it might be a consolation that they broke a nail and at least it wasnt one from the two hands. there isnt a third hand, if there were it would only spell more long nails and a higher consumption of nail polish and nail polish remover and other related items of use to women, cross dressing men, transvestites and other people who use nail polish (little kids who want to differentiate MY MUG from MY SISTERS MUG.  is nail polish, Polish? i guess i will never find out. or is simple polish, Polish? was polish used for the first time in Poland or did a Pole use it for the first time. if a Pole used it for the first time, who helped it? i mean, how can a POLE paint its own self. if it could paint would it let the Dog destroy it by raising one leg and doing it? which reminds me of the freedom Dogs and cats and other such animals have. They can just go ahead and do it. especially the stray ones. we have so many double standards. Our pets are more free to do what they wanna do they we are. more over they are fed and we have to kill and eat (that might be one of the ways to define working for a large organiation). for every job you get, some ten people dont, or maybe more. so should we consider ourselves lucky? or just plain stupid? or undemocratic (since we are doing something that the majority aint doin?) or cruel cause we disallow someone from taking a job and going back broken hearted or hungry or somehting like that?
If you should die before me, ask if you could bring a friend 					 (Stone Temple Pilots)    An innuendo is an insinuation (and or an implication or suggestion).  Life is full of little innuendos, it at times seems to be built of these little one liners that people keep dishing out as if they are home grown in their back yard or back lawn or what ever those things with grass and other weeds is called. Turns out most of them are from forwards and other kinds of emails that these people send and receive over a period of time. Johnny was a little boy; Johnny was a happy little boy until he started receiving these forwards. He now is a big boy; he is a big boy because he hates, and hate, like love is an extreme emotion. Johnny hates these forwards and every other thing that these forwards accompany.   	 Diarrhea is an innuendo.  It is an innuendo because it is tells you what you have done (Implication of), and it definitely TELLS you what you have to do in the very near future (Suggestion). It plays with one’s mind, wages psychological warfare on the mind, body and soul of the victim. Almost all of us have gone through it at least once in our lives. Anyone who is old enough to get to this web page has frolicked with it once. It is a beautiful thing; it reminds you of how nice and serene the world is. It is more powerful than love OR making love. It leaves your knees wobbly like you had just laid eyes or hands on the most cherished of your possessions. The love of your lives may not bring that effect that diarrhea brings with it. Ignore what you consider discomfort; the rose would never ever be so beautiful had it not been for the thorns.   It all started with a bit of pizza, a bit of fun and a bit of soft drink. The bit became a bit more than the digestive system could handle independently. Maybe it didn’t like the taste of the pizza. I did enjoy the pizza thoroughly but the after math was not a sight to enjoy, not something to write home about.   It is strange, for someone like I , who enjoys a cup of tea while taking a dump it shouldn’t have been THAT gory, but the way I felt, it seemed as if I was ravaged by a creature come up from the dark pits of the universe, something out of a Stephen King book.   The darkness of the night, it was a cool night, cooler in comparison with the previous three weeks of blistering heat. The skies had opened up and the clouds wept with embarrassment as if they already knew what was about to befall my poor self. The wind whined out side, hitting the house with considerable anger, lightning crashing brings occasional sparks of light to the otherwise dark night. I slept unawares, enjoying the cool wind swirling down from my new ROYAL FAN (after having bought it was I told that you may NOT get Amina Haq with it, she only appears in the advertisement does not jump out of the box, I do not like her particularly but having her around wouldn’t have been bad at all). How? Oh how could it have occurred to naïve old me about how my life was going to change forever?   It was a lesson in relativity. Sharp pangs followed by even sharper ones, cramping in the abdominal/lower abdominal area, spasms in the lower back. It all felt familiar, as if I had heard about it somewhere. I feared the worst; I t
