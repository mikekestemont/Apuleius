Apparently changing the template isn't so tough.  That is, if you're not starting from scratch...  I found lots of help by searching for "Blogger Template" in Google. :-)
Darn. Just as I thought it was too good to be true.  SpyMAC.com offers 100 megs free webhosting, and 1 gig e-mail. (sounds familiar?) Plus, free blogging. :-)   Amazing, I thought. Until I tried to access the SpyDisk (webhosting) feature. Apparently, from the Forum, you have to have wait 36 hours. They use WebDAV, and what is that? I've tried looking online for WebDAV freeware for Windows (can't afford my programs to stop working after 1 month) and I've found 4 WebDAV clients at WebAttack... all Shareware. Kudos, WebAttack!! Coulda gotten the freeware too?  Anyway. I quite like Blogger. It's funky. Now, how do I change the template?
there is a feeling one gets when one starts to blog. I will now attempt to describe that feeling, elusive though it is, that I feel.  I am now Powerful! To think that I Could not find the words; Yet now, they come tumb-ling!  words came not easy; in silence, i dreamed; yet now, the power of a newfound eloquence is mine.  so go forth and froth my everlasting thoughts! effervescent though you may be.  i gawk, gape and google -- i GO to google to OGLE. and the [b] has gotten to [me].
it works! it's alive! and yes, i can breathe again. hopefully this blog stays alive.
in the beginning, there was nothing. and then God created something. So I guess he did a pretty good job of it. Someone probably thinks I'm trying to be a smart alec when I say that he may or may not have planned for us humans (his creations) to invent cars and computers (our creations) and thus indirectly, he isn't the creator of all things. In that case, would God be the creator of us (people) if he had intended to create the world (universe) but not its eventualities? I wonder.

the two women sit at the table and smile at each other because they know each other  and the one asks the other, “How is your married life?”  to which the other replies, “It is all very well, thank you... and what about your single life?”  to which the one answers, “It is also very well, thank you...”  and they laugh and talk about their exploits  the married one talks about her husband unicentric in nature, is her mind focused on home and husband and child and she laughs, as it is her life  and the single one wonders if she had missed out on anything on the security of a husband and a home on the love of a child or children on the continuing comfort of security  and the single one talks about her exploits diffused in focus, she is bubbly and she is hunted by men as surely as she hunts the best of them  she laughs about the gifts she receives and the time she spends juggling between her lovers how they have on many occasions been the game of her emotions  and the married one wonders if she had made a mistake if she had married the wrong man if her prince charming had lost his way and was looking out for her  and she wonders if she could be free from this drudgery this mind-numbing mundanity of repeating everything everyday, in the same way and if the sizzle in her life has given way to a more benign matronly boredom...  the conversation stalls... and the one and the other sip their cappucino, and their mocha... and all niceties are showing without a single glint of their mind's churnings...  and life, as ever, goes on.
freely flighting away from thee; nimbly nighting it out with thee; blithely blighting the best of thee; blissfully bedding the rest of thee.  in stupor i succumb to sobriety; to ingenuity, i inveigle from infamy.     i leap across, to where you are... not. the waters shimmer as i lift from rock.
all and sundry shall not go hungry with good husbandry;  consider the sky: deeply mystified and excoriated by lights.     and the soar of liquor is this poem's sculptor and its heady motor.     and relationships work as they are advert- ised, it's a circ- ular prize in a pert- inent lie.
there is a woman before me, who, melancholy in her eyes, sighs.     no, i have not money, to ease away the penury; nor do i have sympathy, to ease away the injury.  but then, a beckoning hand, she looks earnest in the eye; and hopes, perhaps, for a brief respite.  no, say i, i have no thing for you; but the woman clings, sobs, and says  i have no friend but one: my loneliness i find, everyplace i try to run from it. do not now let me languish in this wrenching loneliness! for now i have found in you the crown and the fount  fool! say i, see you not? am i not like you in loneliness craved?  ah, said she -- but for that. 'tis a sure thing: when we find each other our loneliness shall flutter and in a brief respite: vanish.  ah. i see...
what expectations are we expected to meet? to be the mat beneath the feet?  they say: to be kind, is to be c
