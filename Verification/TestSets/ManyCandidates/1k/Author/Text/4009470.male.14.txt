July 24, 2004   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Today is Games Day in Area 4 for NPCC. It is held at Guangyang Secondary School at Braddell. It is currently at a temporary holding site as the school is being rebuilt at site. It looks a lot like the old Rosyth!  :-)  Fortunately, it is raining quite badly and the activities start at around 10 am, so we spend a lot of time drawing buses and trains (lame!). No one from our school actually bothers to cheer (waste our breath) and we either play UNO, chess or talk incessantly.     &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the games, though not all games have been played, there is this prize-presentation ceremony. The girls seem to be leading all the cheers and rejoice and they shrill! Our school does not even bother to cheer as we are very   sian   and we are very humble (lolz) ... some schools shriek though getting third for soccer or carrom ... with of course the girls leading ... wonder why ...    &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After today, I wonder why do they (the girls)&nbsp;have to shrill to show that their school has won something ... i remember one competition in which even RGS girls (i m not lying) also shrill when they won something!     &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wonder if this is just been supportive and passionate for your school or just trying to be EXTRA and at the same time adding to noise pollution.    &nbsp;   WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS ARTICLE/REFLECTION?

31st July 2004            Today I decide to go for  NUS Junior Team Maths Training  (though I know that the stuff are still repeated) . Basically I am pissed off with  NPCC  as the stupid seniors called me up so late in the night ... so I see the prefect  Mister David Lu (or Loo)  wear a prefect blazier for the training when I am only wearing home clothes. I think he wants to show off to the  RGS girls  (not chio one!) that he is a prefect (a method of wooing perhaps). He claims that  he has to rush back to RI  later for the GEP Open House at 1.15pm.            It seems like  maths pro Yeong Li Qian  is unable to solve the maths problems today, perhaps he is too tired or bored to do them. Ronald Chan, our class 'koper', is so ks that he copies everything down and makes me very much worried. He always talk a lot of trash in class.           It seems like the SIMO people are tired of  curry puffs  (makes me want to puke by the way) and they now only serve packet drinks. It is not like we like to eat curry puffs.           By the way, next week is the  history drama finals  and I hope our school can win the championship ...      WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS ARTICLE/REFLECTION? DO COMMENT AND REPLY TO THIS POST!

Here is the extract of the essay written by Amanda Wei-Zhen Chong of Raffles Girls' Secondary and her essay won 1st prize for Class A. Hope you can enjoy it!    &nbsp;    What the Modern Woman Wants    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE old woman sat in the backseat of the magenta convertible as it careened down the highway, clutching tightly to the plastic bag on her lap, afraid it may be kidnapped by the wind. She was not used to such speed, with trembling hands she pulled the seatbelt tighter but was careful not to touch the patent leather seats with her callused fingers, her daughter had warned her not to dirty it, “Fingerprints show very clearly on white, Ma”. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her daughter, Bee Choo, was driving and talking on her sleek silver mobile phone using big words the old woman could barely understand. “Finance” “Liquidation” “Assets” “Investments”… Her voice was crisp and important and had an unfamiliar lilt to it. Her Bee Choo sounded like one of those foreign girls on television. She was speaking in an American accent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old lady clucked her tongue in disapproval. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I absolutely cannot have this. We have to sell!” Her daughter exclaimed agitatedly as she stepped on the accelerator; her perfectly manicured fingernails gripping onto the steering wheel in irritation. &nbsp;&nbsp; “I can't DEAL with this anymore!" she yelled as she clicked the phone shut and hurled it angrily toward the backseat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mobile phone hit the old woman on the forehead and nestled soundlessly into her lap. She calmly picked it up and handed it to her daughter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Sorry, Ma” she said losing the American pretense and switching to Mandarin. “I have a big client in America. There have been a lot of problems.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old lady nodded knowingly. Her daughter was big and important. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bee Choo stared at her mother from the rear view window, wondering what she was thinking. Her mother’s wrinkled countenance always carried the same cryptic look. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The phone began to ring again, an artificially cheerful digital tune, which broke the awkward silence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Hello Beatrice! Yes, this is Elaine.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elaine. The old woman cringed. I didn’t name her Elaine. She remembered her daughter telling her, how an English name was very important for “networking”, Chinese ones being easily forgotten. &nbsp;&nbsp; “Oh no, I can't see you for lunch today. I have to take the ancient relic to the temple for her weird daily prayer ritual.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ancient Relic. The old woman understood perfectly it was referring to her. Her daughter always assumed that her mother’s silence meant she did not comprehend.  &nbsp;&nbsp; “Yes, I know! My car seats will be reeking of joss sticks!” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old woman pursed her lips tightly, her h
