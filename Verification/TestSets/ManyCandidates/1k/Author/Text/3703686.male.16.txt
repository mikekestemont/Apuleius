Well, I just can't resist taking some potshots at some businesses and their horrifically laughable and simply mind-numbing marketing and branding activities. Alright, I'm sure a lot of us would have heard about marketing techniques aimed at the GEN X and how conventional advertising techniques and channels often don't work that well as they have grown immune to such forms of blatant advertising. Coupled with hearing how word-of-mouth advertising is making rounds, many companies turn to such a tecnique in hopes of getting the product out to the consumers. You've often heard of how they say, "Give the popular kids your product first and make them be seen wearing it...hopefully the trend will take off" Well, that's indeed a good way to start, but if done horribly. It could very much mean you have booked a spot at the crematorium for your company. Well, if there's a worst case example, I think this has to be it.  Alright, here's the story I heard: There was this particular Contact Lenses Company (whom I'm not naming, though I would really love to), who decided to start a campaign within the polytechnic promoting their new daily color lenses..hmmm..alright sounds good..so there was this bloke who was sent to look out for good looking guys and girls to shortlist as "candidates", well, it goes downhill from here. Their proposition was that these people would be sponsored by the company and will be given free lenses to wear, and in exchange for that, they are supposed to go around telling other people about their lenses..So what's wrong? Plenty. First, they treat these candidates as stupid beggars whom they think are desperate enough for free lenses to go around promoting them to other students. Two, blatantly choosing these people and letting everyone know about the deal isn't exactly the wisest thing to do. Three, they are not giving these things to this people and letting them discover the merits of the product and marketing it to others themselves through word-of-mouth, rather, it was a bizarrre demand that once they are supplied with the contact lenses, they are supposed to promote them. What do they think they are doing?! Buying puppets? I suppose when the campaign fails, they will go back complaining how those marketers writing stuff about word of mouth and viral marketing are really just plain crap. Pity the fools.
For international viewers, I am expressing my views as of the climate here in Singapore.    Walk into any McDonald's outlet and a few things instantly hits you. VIBRANT, COOL, CLEAN. Walk into any KFC outlet, you don't really get that same sensation. Just look at the staff uniforms. Black polo shirts with I'm Lovin It emblazoned on it. KFC's? Pale yellow shirts with blue pants and an embroidery of Colonel Sanders' face on the pocket. Amazingly, both pay part-time workers, an hourly rate of $3.50 an hour. But I believe, young people would rather don a McDonald's black polo tee than a dull-looking yellow shirt. What's that got to do with branding? Lots in fact. Knowingly or unknowingly, McDonald's has attracted the right people they need to portray the image of vibrancy. Attracting young people to work there, gives it the unseen energy to portray an image driving a corporation. I for one, am still puzzled why youths willingly work for such meagre rates.     Besides that, just look at the ad campaigns. If you have seen it, you know, I don't really need to say much. While McDonald's ad campaign is synchronized globally under I'm Lovin It!, the best effort dished out by KFC is a series of adds showing KFC's tagline of Finger Lickin Good. Not that I'm criticizing anything, but hey, just look at those ads, they are not at all vibrant, and does not at all captivate the attention of the viewer and has to really LOOK at the ad to understand what it means. And what does it mean? Finger Lickin Good...duh. Exciting? Hardly. AND, I'm not even mentioning those ads that they run..."Celebrate this Festive Occasion with a Special Christmas Family meal at only $21.90" MAN, the consumers are not dumb! How different is that meal offered to the normal one?! OUCH, breaking marketing rule #1: Don't treat your customers like idiots. How much money, effort and resources are wasted (not spended) on such garbagy stuff? They really have no place to spend money.    Enough said. I have tonnes more, but I'm not saying all. If KFC is interested, I can send them some of my observations. Of course, I'm charging for using my brain.
Bust your brains coming out with ideas, because ideas, are the next thing that you are going to trade for money. Just like some labourer getting paid for moving stones centuries ago, or miners mining for gold. You could mine all you want, bore holes in grounds in search of oil decades back and become so darn filthy rich. But try boring holes in the ground now or dig up your backyard for gold. Chances are, you will find dirt, back-breaking work and if you dig or bore at the wrong places, big trouble. But ideas, are such elusive creatures. If you have to dig or bore, do it to that pinkish lump lodged between your ears. For those who went for lobotomy and still can't get creative and come up with any ideas, trust me, you will be better off latching onto someone's idea and helping them execute it.  So, work your brains out.
I am not exaggerating when I say, "My business depended on the internet." You know, the internet is such a powerful,yet vulnerable medium. We are all plug into this phone line and voila! We see pictures. We talk to some other guy 8 hrs beind you. We get this information overload, and everyone seems to be a writer. Yet, when the electricity goes out, so does everything. The internet is a medium that is shaping the world and the way people do things. Alright, you might say what I just said all sounded r
