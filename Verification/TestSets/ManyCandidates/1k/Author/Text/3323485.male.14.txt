What do other people see me as? A Statistic? An automated prgramming/webmastering/making an ass of himself machine? Why not? thats really all I am. When you look through the blog listiogs, and you see Peter Ooms' Weblog, did you click on me because you liekd the name?   ive just noticed something...ive had no effect on anything. if i was never born, the only differences would be a couple of schoolbooka and this blog wouldnt be here. holy s**t now I really am depressed. im just off to do some homework. might aswell kill myself for all the dofference it would make to everyone elses life.

In case you havent guessed, i hate year eihts. they think theyre so smart with their 'no longer the smallest guy' attitude. it just gets me pissed off. I was walking around, minding my own buisiness, and a bunch of 4+ year 8s appeared from nowhere and started pissing about with me. All I did was call one of them a 'stupid git' and it got dirty. I wont go into the details, bot there was 4+ of them, 1 of me and they were bigger, so you can guess the rest. Just before it got bad, two teachers appeared from nowhere.   I never thought I would  ever  hear myself say this, but thank god for teachers!
Hello World Today we did the 1500m boys trials. I think i did $h17. My time, if anhybody wants it, is 7 mins 49 secs. I had another of those thoughts today. If I were to die, suddenly now, would people remember me, and if yes, what as. Would they remember me as "that little ba$+ard who gave me the finger" ot "a cool goy who f****d it up". -Well, partof me today wanted to commit suicide.   Holy s**t! Ive just realised the implications of what I just said. HJeres me, a 12-year-old, sitting here, chewing some plastic, seriously concidering  suicide !  Well, just if I do snuff it today, can you please remember one thing. Please...   For centuries, the world has been, and will continue to be rigged with people both willing and able to exploit the ignorant. Someday, nobody knows when, all the ignorant who have been scammed willl rise up and defeat theese vast bodies. The rebels will suceed and life will be a fair thing. Until...    Ignorance Is Weakness  (c)2004 Peter W. Ooms
Dont you just  hate  it when you know you are right, and someone persistant keeps on contradicting you! I will say it now and say it clear. In the Matrix, Neo takes the RED pill to exit the matrix. I was arguing about this with Paul one day, and, along came Dominic and, because he fancies Paul, agreed with him. HE'S NEVER EVEN SEEN THE F**KING MATRIX!!!!!!!! This really makes my blood boil. If I were prime Minister, I would outlaw homosexuality, outlaw this qstupid theory everyones got. I will make my views clear...  A GOOD WINNER IS BULLS**T. AS IS A GOOD LOSER. PEOPLE WIN THINGS SO THAT THEY CAN TAKE THE P**S FROMN THE OTHER TEAM. WE WON WE WON WE WON. BAD LOSERS!
Im sure you will all agree with me that exactists (perfectionists) are a f*****g nucianse! I say i wish I was dead, then someone comes over 2 me and says "how can you say that? its i wish i WERE dead! speak properly"   I ask u...this world is WiErD
Well Ive just finished my homework and it has taken me just under four hours. I woke up at 11:00 AM GMT and have just finished it now...at 3:19 GMT. I hate homework. Why? It reminds me of school. Also, it is a tedious wase of time on pointless busy work.  If there are any teachers reading this, DOWN WITH HOMEWORK!!! I think,on a none-uniform day, I will come to school in a t-shirt that says DOWN WITH HOMEWORK! That should get 'em!! Well, Ive got to write my PowerPoint Presentation to a CD-R so if you dont mind?...
umm...Im hard pushed to find anything interesting to say about today. Mums still doing her stuff fow work, im still left tidying my room and all that crap.   No new E-Mail Messages. As Ever, no normal humans need/want/can be arsed to communicate with me. Cant say I blame them...im always a bore and a sadass. Nothing new or interesting. Always going on about space and computers and all that f**king s**t. I wonder...if I were to drop dead right now, would people remember me...if yes, what as... I'll think about that one and reply as soon as another insignificant thought enters my head.   Its one of 'em days, i'm afraid.
Its not often that I will devote a whole blog to a peice of software, but I must recommend the MSVDM. You can have up to four virtual desktops on any one machine...and best of all...ITS FREE!!!!!  For more info, see http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/downloads/powertoys.asp .   It only works with Windows XP
The title says it all.   Apparently, today is 'national s*x day'. Apparently: my true love has discovered she loves me yesterday at midnight and something good will hapen to me between 2.00 and 4.00 today. Well, IT DID  Though its got nothing to do with relationships  shall I tell you anyway? OK,. then    SCHOOL ENDED!!!    and its friday today! That means my first weekend blogging.  Isnt it funny that today was hilariously boring and yet I have a lot to say?  Life is Wierd.  t . h . e . . . t . r . t . h . . . i s . . . o . u . t . . . t . h . e . r . e . . . . . .
