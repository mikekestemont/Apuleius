We all want to give a good impression to our parents, right?  We want them to be proud of us and see us as mature adults.  I just remembered that over Thanksgiving break, my mom taught me a new Korean word - 'jebee-jo.'  She used that to describe me.  I asked what that meant, and the literal translation has something to do with a bird swooping down or something...or analogously describing a guy who dresses up, goes out to the bars, gets the ladies drunk, then swwoooop...takes 'em home.  So, I guess it's a Korean slang term for 'player'.  I should clearly note that she used that term only to describe the way I dress...nothing to do with my personality or what I would actually do.  I don't do much swooping.  For the record, I (or probably any of my friends) don't think I dress anything like a player.
I hope everyone had a good First Flight Centennial.  I certainly took time out in my day to reflect upon the Wright brothers' great achievement.  Uhh, riiight...  Everyone was at the celebration in Kitty Hawk, NC, including astronaut John Glenn, which was a little disappointing.  Why disappointing?  Well, in 2001, the church I was going to in Northern Virginia celebrated its 50th anniversary.  John Glenn was a member of the church while he was in the area.  In fact there is a nifty plaque somewhere in the church recongnizing him.  He was invited to the 50th anniversary spectacular, but he didn't show up.  Jerk.  So instead, I got to listen to the oldest living member tell us "how it was back in the good old days."  On a more serious note...  For those of you who have seen Ari's blog recently will have noticed his reply to my call for a truce.  If you haven't seen it, don't worry about it.  Ari somehow thought my request meant that he won, and let's just say he is a poor winner.  But I'll give him that.  He's been suffering a long losing streak.  Poor Michigan State.  The last time I saw anything free-fall so quickly....  Well, let's just leave it at that.
It's time to call a truce.  This blog war I've been having with Ari has gone on long enough.  Too many tears have been shed and friendships have been broken.  We shouldn't be drawing lines to divide us, but rather creating bonds to unite us.  Ari and I could be making a grand statement - two competitors (and even Christian vs. Jewish) finding common ground and joining forces to fight evil together, rather than fighting against each other.  What a beautiful thing.
So, we finally caught Saddam.  I think it would've been funny if when we cleaned him up and shaved his beard, we shaved a nice Hitler mustache for him.  Anyway, that's the extent of my political commentary.  In other news, Bill has left us.  I dedicate this post to 'Wild' Bill Curtis.  He is the reason most of my class came to Duke.  We will forever have ingrained in our minds the image of Bill preaching to us up on the altar at the Joyce, reminding us that North Carolina does indeed have beaches and mountains, but they're both too far away from Durham to really enjoy during school.
I rule.  And so does Kevin.  We passed econometrics!  I've never been so happy to get an 'S'.  For those of you who don't know the Duke grad school grading scale, 'S' stands for 'super'.  I also just finished my micro exam.  I'm pretty positive I passed that class too.  I am a happy Dan.  **We are the champions, we are the champions....no time for losers 'cause we are the champions...**  I thought I'd also share an exciting idea I had the other day.  I was thinking about my future, so naturally, I began thinking about my future children.  Then I thought about names for them.  I'm going to name my kids after the greek alphabet.  So, my first born will be Alpha.  Then comes Beta.  How sweet is that?  I think the best is going to be Epsilon, which would be a great girl's name.  Epsi for short.  Kind of cute, eh?  But that's a lot of kids....kid number five.
Quoting an email from Kevin Morrison: Folks, I ran into Ralph in the hall just now -- for those who don't know, he's a bright first year econ student -- and he was saying everyone got their ass kicked on that exam this morning.  He was hilarious: he said,  "My bald spot was standing on end when I looked at that exam."
I just had perhaps my most painful exam, which was in econometrics.  I should note that I had some crazy dreams last night, including being chased by someone trying to kill me while I was trying to protect a teddy bear.  I don't know what that means, but I suppose that was a bad omen.  The exam could have been a nice experience.  After I read each question, I thought to myself, "Huh, that's an interesting question.  I'd actually like to know the answer to that."  What sucked was that I didn't know how to answer any of them.  Although we had weekly homework assignments, the exam wasn't representative of those assignments at all...or an old final that Barb gave to us to study from.  I've had my doubts about econometrics before, so during the exam, I decided that 'metrics isn't my thing.  So, I decided not to take it next semester.  But then I realized that I wasn't doing so well in microeconomics either.  That's when I thought to myself, "Geez, I'm totally screwed!"  I pondered whether I should be in grad school at all.  After about five or ten minutes of this heated internal debate, I returned to the task at hand - getting a nice ass-whooping from the exam.  On the bright side, the exam wasn't very mentally tiring (paradoxically).  I was so clueless on so many of the questions, it really didn't matter if I thought long and hard a
