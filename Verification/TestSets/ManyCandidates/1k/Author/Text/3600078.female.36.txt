The name of this woman eludes me, but I want to say it was Lily, or Rosa, some beautiful and delicate flower name that completely contradicted the true nature of her undelightful personality.  I think I 'll call her Hortensia for now.  Hortensia was of Cuban descent - a robust woman built like a tank who carried herself like a general from Castro's elite army.  At a glance, one could tell who truly ran the post production studio where she spent her days helping run the business owned by her son (whom I shall refer to as The Mama's Boy).   She was a tough old lady, ripe with tradition and probably a little mad with power.  I wouldn't be surprised if she knew how to operate a side arm - she certainly knew how to maneuver a can of hairspray.  There was never a strand out of place and her bracelets hung on her thick wrists like bells on a cat, ever warning us of the clear and present danger she represented.  She was always there before me and the other girl who worked there arrived, ever vigilante of our arriving late.  It would have given her another excuse to despise us.  She would glide out of the back office, respectable shoes and off color nylons perfectly complimenting her rayon flowered office dress, glance at the clock and give us a "good morning" that was neither heartfelt or remotely friendly.  More like "You have escaped my wrath for the moment, but the day is still young" sort of look.  We would go hang our coats and pray for lunchtime to come quickly.  I knew she was unhappy person, though.  On a very uncomfortable car ride to pick up lunch for some clients, she confessed to me her humble beginnings, her arranged marriage and the things she had to endure coming to America with a man she neither loved or admired. I listened with sympathy, and thought that perhaps after this bonding experience she might treat me differently and actually like me.  This never happened.  Shortly after, I discovered an ad in the paper in the employment section advertising my position, prompting me to quit with absolutely no notice.  I knew it had been her decision, and regardless of my rapport with the clients and the various musicians I was on friendly terms with, The Mama's Boy didn't have the testicles to stand up to his mother, and so planned to let me go at some point.  And that was the last I saw of Hortensia.  I know I should try and think of something good I saw in her, but it's truly difficult.  Her misery was impenetrable, and she saturated the studio with her absolute need to control.  But I suppose despite all of that, she wasn't a terrible person.  As I said, she was just unhappy, and unhappiness can be a destructive thing in anyone's life.
Last night I ran into my former creative writing instructor from last year quite unexpectedly.  She showed up at my punk aerobics class, and we had a nice chat - she told me she still meets informally with one of the students from the class I was in, and I was welcome to workshop with them when I was ready.  This got me thinking that I need to get back into writing again.  I always did well in those classes, so I'm pretty confident I can return to that particular creative excercise.  So, to get things rolling, I thought I would do a series of character studies - basically a description or related story of people I have met that left a lasting impression on me in some way.  The next entry will be the first of what I hope will be an engaging series of blog entries that I can also use as reference material in the future.  More to come!
I feel very on the right track currently.  I think that by achieving this focus and clarity of purpose, a door to creativity opened in my mind that was previously blocked by self-doubting and fear.  Now, every time I sit down with my bass, I think of something new and grooving to work on as far as a new song.  And I do this blog as regularly as I can, and I always seem to have something of import to discuss (at least to me, anyway).    I really think it started with this blog - if you're a creative person, I think it's important to keep that flow happening with any kind of outlet.  You know, keep the neurons firing so they don't become flabby and out of shape.  Sure, it took me 36 years to discover this(oy, I'm old) but what the hell - at least I figured something out.  I am still so excited about my new solo bass project (I'm going to call the percussionist up today and see if she's interested)and also about my new business venture.  I really do get fired up when I'm planning something - it's not really a platform for anal retentiveness as much as it is a creative/give some joy to myself and others sort of thing.  And I've been in such a good mood about it.    Now I just have to get through the day to day yawndom of my job.  Sigh.  Well, it's always something,eh?  Meanwhile, the quest to relocate to San Diego continues...
Yes, family.  We all have one, and most of us realize we can't escape them if we tried.  For the longest time, I avoided mine and never really enjoyed being with them, and this was mostly due to the many traumas that were inflicted on me while I was growing up.  While I don't have any inclination to share what those are, I can only assume that these negative events had a lot to do with the lack of closeness I feel with any family member.  But now I'm older, and I have found my attitude changing towards my family.  I owe this rethinking to two fairly recent experiencesn t
