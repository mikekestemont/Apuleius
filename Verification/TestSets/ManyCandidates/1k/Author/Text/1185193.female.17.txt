Friends Aren't Forever?   I felt so offended by something my friend said to me today.  I opened up to her, confiding how difficult it has been for me to dance and attend dance classes, and how my dance teacher and I have been meeting outside of class to catch me up on the performance numbers.  There was a brief silence, and all of the sudden, she started telling me how frustrating it is when little kids at her studio stop attending classes because it adds the stress of rearranging choreography to accomodate their uncomittment.  What?!  Could she just listen to me and ask me questions regarding my situation?  Was she inferring that I was uncomitted, like one of the little children?  She just made me so angry, but before I could say anything, we peeled off into our classrooms.  It is incredible to me how hard it is for some people to just be good friends sometimes, especially when another friend opens up.  Maybe that silence indicated that she just didn't know how to respond.  But that's bull because we have been friends since first grade.  Nevertheless, whenever I try to find some solace inside of one of my friends regarding my illness, I'm always shut out.  It is almost as intense as opening up your heart to someone you love and deeply care about, and feeling almost a sense of betrayal and shame after it is not received.  But then again, maybe she just didn't know how to respond...but what are the rest of my friends' excuses?   Random Blurbs   Here are some random observations I made at school today:  1.  Adrienne always eats Cheese-Its for lunch.  She talks too much and always has the orange carbs infecting her braces,  And when she throws back her head to laugh, you can see it caked on the inside of her cheeks.  *shudder*  2.  No one in the library seriously works, except Jacob Inglander (sp?).  He wore a magenta polo shirt today.  Combined with his yellow back pack and hair that is fierce competition for Gianni Garbagnati, I'd say Jacob is definetely gay.  Maybe bi.  Clearly, I'm only speculating, but he just has that look.  (don't worry, I'm not homophobic, I'm simply making an observation).  3.  Conversation from the frosh table at lunch revealed the main difference in how to "be cool" at Bellarmine v. Mitty.  At Bell it is cool to participate and raise your hand in class; in other words, it's cool to be a teacher's pet.  At Mitty, no one likes the person who is involved in a teacher's lecture in class (*cough* Catherine Dietrich)--that would be lame.  If a teacher chooses to call on people for participation, everyone is chanting "Don't pick me" frantically under their breath.  (In no way does this challenge Mitty's unquestionable superior intelligence over Bell :)  4.  For the first time, I heard Dorothy Lau speak today.  If I closed my eyes, I would have never guessed that that was her voice.  As a somewhat cruel joke, she is known to many as "the antelope."  She walks with a hilarious natural bounce on the balls of her feet.  I'd like to see her try and balance a book on her head.  Her name is also derived from the fact that she runs through the grass and flower planters to get to class.  In conclusion, does anyone know if Shingles is contagious?  Mr. Fajardo has Shingles and I accidentally sat in the same chair in the library as he did.  Should I be worried?
"Supermodel work, turn it to the left!  Work, turn it to the right!"   Anyone know that song besides me? *silence with intermittent coughs*  Okay...  So I bought this really cool tech toy called Virgin Something-Or Rather (I can't remember the whole name, and no, it's not what it may sound like).  Anyways, I bought it for when I go to the gym.  It is a compact am/fm radio..or so I thought when I bought it.  Actually, it turns out to be the most amazing little apparatus I've ever discovered.  Not only does it have the radio, but it has t.v. stations and some other thing that is supposed to be cool that I don't understand.  So when I'm working out, I can listen to live t.v.!  How cool is that?!  Anyways, the bad thing is that it came with those piddely-ass earphones you are supposed to stick in your ears.  Except my ears are deformed because they always fall out.  When sitting.  And you can imagine running.  People probably think I have some kind of rash in my ears because I always touch them to keep the earphones in.  Or if they were intelligent they would see cords hanging down and realize it was a little walkman.  But then it comes back to the issue of deformed ears...*sigh*  So I need your help...I have been given two suggestions to solve this problem:  1.  Hold them in with scotch tape.  (Interesting idea but if I am sweating, won't the tape come off??) 2.  Wear REAL earphones.  The kind that has the band over your head and outer ear covers.  (But isn't that dorky these days?  All the cool people [I'm cool right???] wear the petite, posh ones).  So many choices.  Any suggestions?  Please leave them in "La Caja MÃ¡gica" (for those linguistically challenged, that means "The Magical Box"  :)
Zoom, Zoom, Zoom   I received my first ticket today.  I knew that I was going to get one, but I defiantly ignored the risk.  When I later came out to my car to go home, I saw the little white paper on my windshield and sighed as my heart sank.  It was only $10, but I still felt ashamed.  This added yet another crack in my perfection facade that I try so hard to keep up.  Finally, after accepting the fact that I had gotten the ticket, I moved back into an apathetic state.  It was really no big deal, right?  Let me set up the situation for you.  My first class was at 11:40am t
