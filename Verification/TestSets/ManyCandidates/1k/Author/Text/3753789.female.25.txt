Ok, so I have a not so secret addiction.  FOOD. FOOD. FOOD. FOOD. FOOD. FOOD. FOOD. FOOD.  FOOD. FOOD. FOOD. FOOD. FOOD. FOOD. FOOD. FOOD. FOOD. FOOD. FOOD. FOOD . . . . . . ok, must stop.  I refuse to dedicate this entry to my low self esteem, so I will instead dwell on its cause.    I love food.  I love chicken sandwiches, and pasta, and french fries, and Subway sandwiches, and fish & hush puppies, and pizza.  But most of all I. LOVE. CHOCOLATE.  What is there not to love about chocolate?  Chocolate = Love.   So I will describe how to make one of my favorite Chocolate yummies so you too, Constant Reader, (okay, so I stole that from Stephen King - I love him) can enjoy its chocolaty deliciousness and fattening goodness.  My friend Meghan (whom I get to see about once every 2 years and who recently became engaged to sweet, cute boyfriend Daniel) used to spend the night together all the time.  It was there, in little bitty Scott, Mississippi, that I discovered the DOTTIE SHAKE.  Dottie is Meghan's mother.  She is the cutest thing, and every time I spent the night she would come up the stairs and say "Shall we have a milkshake?"  (She always said "shall" - it was great.)   I loved those milkshakes.  After about 20 minutes or so she would come back up to collect our glasses and ask "Do you want another one?"   Now, being the good overnight guest like my mother taught me to be, I knew the proper response was "No, Ma'am" (We say Ma'am religiously in the South).  However, I could NOT, COULD NOT!!!! resist the allure of the milkshake. "Yes, please; thanks, Mom."  (we - Meghan's friends - also called her mom, Mom, and her dad, Pop.)  I don't remember when, but eventually we christened the milkshakes "Dottie Shakes".  When my daughter was born, Mom (Dottie) and Meghan came to the hospital and brought... stuff to make Dottie Shakes!!!  We had to sit the ice cream right on top of the air conditioner to slow the melting, but OOOOOHHHHH Heaven, nothing could have made me feel better right then!  What mysterious magical goodness must be in these mythical Dottie Shakes, you ask?    Well, I will happily tell you.   BUT YOU MUST NOT DEVIATE FROM OR SUBSTITUTE FOR THE INSTRUCTIONS OR YOU WILL NOT BE EATING A MAGICALLY SCRUMPTIOUS DELICIOUS DOTTIE SHAKE.  Ok.  You  must  have:         Breyer's Vanilla Fudge Twirl Ice Cream     - -This is singularly THE most important part of the DS.  You must not even consider substituting ANY. OTHER. BRAND. of ice cream.  You will be sorely disappointed.  If and ONLY IF there is no Vanilla Fudge Twirl, then plain Chocolate will substitute.  NO OTHER OPTIONS.  Believe me, I have tried Breyer's Rocky Road, and other flavors, but it is disastrous and totally NOT a Dottie Shake.     Milk    - -Whole milk, not 2% or any of the other crappy milk.  If you are going to to the Dottie, you must go all the way.    Short, fat, plastic cup  Spoon  Napkin    Now you must get this part right.  Put whatever amount of ice cream you desire. (Be warned, if you make your DS too small, you WILL want another.  Go for it.)  The key is the MILK. Pour only enough milk over the ice cream to gently---GENTLY!!! cover it lightly.  1.5 seconds of milk pouring is precisely right.    Now take your spoon and moooosh the milk and ice cream together about 10 times.  You do not want the traditional milkshake consistency. If you can drink it through a straw, you have a) used to much milk and b) mooooshed too much.  Now wrap a napkin around your short, fat, plastic cup, because it is cold, and that's what Dottie (a.k.a. Mom) always did, so do it.  You're committed to this thing, right?  OK!  Eat.  Enjoy the frozen chunkiness.    Now, have another.   And there you go, a Dottie Shake.  I have been eating them for over 10 years.
If you know me, you know that Bub and I have made some pretty serious cash from selling stuff on eBay. We started with Scottie Pippen yearbooks (since we attended and I teach at the same high school as our dear Bull) that went for way more than I expected.  $300, $200, $250.  I mean, dang. Who knew?  Then Bub started selling all his old baseball cards and stuff.  Lots more cash.  Then we sold everything else that was no longer of value to us.  Deer mounts.  DEER MOUNTS.  I mean really.  Those were a pain in the culo to pack, let me tell you!  Man, those were great times. The money was rolling in.    Then we ran out of stuff to sell.  I have made some money here and there off of clothes (Mine and Janie's), but I get SOOOO tired of listing and fees and all that hooplah.  I just listed some nice clothes of Jane Claire's, so hopefully they will sell.   However, I do believe it is just easier to take most stuff to the Helping Hands.  Big stuff: sell.  Little stuff: fuggetaboudit  Oh, if you want to PURCHASE or BID on any of those items, or screen name is RONDAWG80 - Just search by seller.  (Rondawg is my dad.... he started on eBay, got me hooked, and then quit fooling with it. I never changed screen names because we have 183 feedbacks!!! Yay! Told you we were good.)

I don't care about you or your silly movie, Mr. Moore.  So you think the Bush Administration fiddlefarted around, do you?  How did YOU get your title for this little documentary, Mr. Moore?  Did you ask nicely to borrow said title from one Mr. Bradbury?  All he needed was a phone call, a phone call he politely asked for.  What did you do, Mr. Moore?  You fiddlefarted around. You did not call.  Not f
