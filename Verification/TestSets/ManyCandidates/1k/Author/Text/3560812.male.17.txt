An  urlLink AP article  about Sen. Zell Miller (D-GA) endorsing Bush for President includes a reference to the story of Jacob and Esau:  "I think he has sold his soul for a mess of pottage," said [Democratic Rep. John] Lewis, in a reference to a speech Miller gave as a congressional candidate 40 years ago in which he argued that President Johnson was "a Southerner who sold his birthright for a mess of dark pottage" because of his support for the Civil Rights Act.  (I should note that, as the article says, Miller later changed his position on Civil Rights.) The article proceeds to explain the "mess of pottage" allusion thus: Pottage is defined as a thick soup or stew of vegetables. Huh?  How is that helpful at  all?  Those who are unfamiliar with the Hebrew Bible might not know that Esau, son of Isaac son of Abraham, sold his birthright (i.e. inheritance) to Jacob, his younger brother, for soup.  Esau was tired from hunting, and, upon arriving home, asked Jacob for the soup he had made.  Jacob replied, give me your birthright for the soup.  Clearly, defining pottage (the King James Version's word for the soup) does not explicate the reference at all!  Sadly, this is a typical, though relatively harmless, example of the media's futile and ignorant attempts to provide "context" without knowledge.  (A more pernicious case is that of Israel reporting.)
urlLink Yglesias writes :   I think folks who supported the war on these grounds (Tom Friedman, etc.) are suffering from a serious case of false consciousness. In other words, it's not the case that they have a big idea -- The Need for Reconstruction -- and then the small idea -- Invade Iraq -- follows logically from TNFR. Rather, they had a big idea -- TNFR -- and no real idea of what followed from it. At the same time, there were all these people out there saying "invade Iraq!" "invade Iraq!" "invade Iraq!" so they manaed to convince themselves that invading Iraq would be a good way to implement their big idea. But it isn't, and it wasn't.  I wouldn't put it exactly that way. I would say that other, only partially related factors -- for instance, the idea of "unfinished business," the unwieldy and expensive sanctions, Saddam's violation of the end-of-war terms and direct hostilities against the US (e.g. firing at our planes patrolling the no-fly zone) bumped Iraq to the top of the go-to-war list. The fact that the War on Terror is our primary reason doesn't mean we can't include all those other considerations.   However, I have to agree with Yglesias; Iraq was not the optimal target. I would have either gone after Syria (a clearer direct threat to a free people, and accessible from the sea, and also a stepping stone to Iraq if necessary) or Iran.   I still disagree with Yglesias on the specifics of what a better choice might have been. He seems to advocate using pressure -- with the leverage he says we have (or had before the Iraq War) withother Middle East countries to try to get Egypt to reform. My response is that we couldn't possibly have done that fast enough. We needed to invade somewhere beyond Afghanistan. The Middle East is a target-rich environment, and one country hardly makes a dent. We needed something that would make other dictators change to create a hostile environment for terrorists and open up to the west by introducing greater economic and solcial liberties, rather than just trying not to get caught like Afghanistan. If the US policy of invasion had stopped at Afghanistan, it would not have been a War on Terror. It would have been, essentially, a Clinton- (and pre-9/11 Bush-) style proportional retaliation. Instead, we have made it clear that we expect not merely no traceable offenses, but cooperation. And Qaddaffi, among others, seems to have gotten the message. Iraq may not have been the best country to invade. But something had to be done.   Second-guessing about which country to invade is unhelpful because I don't recall many Democrats proposing alternate invasion plans at the time with which we can now meaningfully contrast the Iraq invasion (with the exception of the usually unserious call to take on Saudi Arabia).
I saw  The Terminal  tonight .  For a summary of the premise, the New York Times description suffices:  Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks), on a long-anticipated visit to New York from the imaginary Eastern European republic of Krakozia, arrives at J.F.K. just as a military coup abolishes his country's government and renders him effectively stateless. A complicated (and somewhat implausible) web of bureaucratic glitches and regulations strands him at the airport, where he remains for nearly a year, unable to board a flight home or hop a cab into Manhattan but innocent of anything that would warrant his detention.   The Terminal is funny, but it is not a comedy.  The chuckles it elicited were not at the degradation of the characters, but at the cleverness of the plot and the characters in it.  One example: Navorski notices that the return of a Smarte Carte yields a reward of one quarter, so he finds SmarteCartes and brings them back to the rack, thus earning his food money.  The conclusion is inevitable, but that is not the point.  Along the way, we find out about the characters (especially Navorski) and their  real  goals, which become the new plot, a subtle and seamless shift from the movie's rather mechanical opening plot.  The one problem I have with the movie is the issue of compassion.  Compassion is talked up as a great virtue, and it is strongly implied that the director of airport security (the closest thing to a villain in this movie) should have just let Navorski through.  I should think that after 9/11, people would have dropped this sort of dangerous frivolity.  You can be compassionate all you want, but don't be compassionate -- don't be generous -- with my life!  Mine!  Do you hear me?  I have the  right  -- the  a
