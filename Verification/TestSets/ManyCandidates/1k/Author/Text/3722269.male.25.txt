(click title for pictures) Well, that was quite a cool way to spend the morning, a little trip out through galatea, te teko, past a couple of hydro dams and back to Rotorua.. along the way we came across an interesting sight, in lower Galatea there was a group of around 20 horses with riders, all dressed up in ridiculous red coats , out for a hunt, complete with poochies, so if thats vaguely interesting for ya, head off and have a look at the pictures. One of the dams had a huge crane called 'goliath' that was on rails the length of the dam, giving it the ability to completely lift a gate for repairs etc.. quite impressive to round a windy corner and be confronted with this monolith of creation.. a big spider of girders and bolts, quite a feat of engineering. Caused me to think a bit about NZ, and iraq and the inevitible running out of resources... not a lot of NZ realise that a good chunk of our electricity comes from renewable resources, mainly geothermal and hydroelectric - this puts us in good stead when you consider that the USA has a little over a days use of petrol/coal in its own reserves, and relies so much on external sources that -will- dry up... unless they keep declaring war and claiming oil reserves - but thats a different rant alltogether. We should marvel in the good decisions our predecessors made to invest in Hydro. We rock. and we'll be enjoying microwave meals long after america has hit apocolyptic energy crisis - hoorah! but then, its america - so who cares! right? Beautiful evening settling in upon us, and the extremely 'small town' takeaways we had in te teko for lunch didnt quite hit the spot, so I'm going to cut some nice big slabs of corned beef, batter them, and call it dinner. Allblacks versus Argentina tonight, watch the scrumming and backline passing. Might post again before bed. Ka Kite Ano, ake ake aue.
Current song playing   [ Eurythmics Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This) ]  Well, it's a nice clear day, and we all know Rotorua is of er.. limited entertainment value, so smokey and I are off on a road trip, up through the backroads in the as yet unnamed lil blue mini. I feel the urge to name it something smurfy, but I think he'll kill me - bahaha. Ahh well, whenst I return I will posteth pictures of aforementioned trippage. Then you can all 'ooooh' and 'aaaaah' about just how swanky my photography is, a'aight? ..And I'll also tell you the tragic tail of cornedbeef gone badÂ©  That's all for now sportsfans.      www.happytreefriends.com  - Todays link.
As is the tradition on a Friday night, when I'm in Rotorua, me, the old man smokey, and my Grandmother get together for dinner.. it's quite cool, because my gran is kinda like granny off the Tweety n Sylvester cartoons.. just the same, little bit slower, whole heap more hard of hearing, just as sweet tho. I'm cooking a lump of corned silverside (corned beef/brisket) slowly, in the crockpot.. crock pots are great like that, bung it in in the morning, whenever you feel like eating that night, its ready, hot, and tender as. But it did occur to me, a conversation I once had with charlotte about how my corned beef was better than her mums.. in that she at least -liked- mine, now.. she could've just been being nice, but she actually -ate- it, so I'm guessing she was being honest. I cant remember what I added to the meat that time, but I do remember ringing 'mum' and effectively getting her recipe, even then, it didnt quite turn out 'like mum used to make' which made me wonder what it is that give women of that generation a knack to make good solid food - other than being chained to the oven, I mean, my mum worked fulltime most of her life, so she was hardly the 'athomebitch'. As society pushes forward and we strive to squeeze what we can out of the little time we have left after working, things like good traditional home cooked meals are slowly dissapearing, My freezer now has a greater proportion of mass produced patties and fillets and things, rather than good old fashioned butcher meat. These new things cook well straight from frozen, take about 20 minutes, and end up costing about $2 a lump. That's pretty hard to argue with. My train of thought about this, caught me the other day, and sent me to a butcher, a good one, in rotorua, and I got a rolled chicken roast, stuffed with honey and macadamia nuts. mmm gorgeous... well should've been. I tried to roast some potatoes up all crispy to go with it.. and ask someone who knows, I'm a pretty good cook, but everything went wrong.. slicing the cooked chicken it completely fell apart. no real worries still tastes the same.. the thing shrunk like a motherfucker, again, still enough, no worries. The electric frypan I was crisping up the potatoes in kept tripping the power cut out, unbeknown to me, so I'd set them sizzling, tend to something else, turn back.. oil cold. FUCK. reset it, seet them sizling.. etc etc What a pain in the arse. Slightly flowery potatoes, chicken that needed reheating, and soggy vege. Dont -ever- waste time doing things the long 'old fashioned' way, My point for the day is that, if the old fashioned way was worth it, we'd still all be doing it the old fashioned way, new things, might not taste quite so good, but are a decent substitute considering the lack of effort needed, and relative cost. That said, I'm ignoring that, and soldiering on, trying to make corned silverside just like mum used to make.. I'll let you know tomorrow, or later tonight, just how I fucked it up. Wish me luck :D Ciao
A moment of your time, if you'd be so kind. I'd like t
