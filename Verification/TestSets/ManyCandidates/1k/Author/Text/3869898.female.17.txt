Ok so i got dropped on my head this time..sucks..but i am still alive! The girl..hmmm... well..she is not strong enough to put me in a full so half of my body is in a full and the other in a pre...yeah ok..duh..I am going to fall....but we finally hit is so I was happy! Anyways more important then that I was the first one finished when we ran today...I added more weight to everything today...so I am really happy about that! But my jumps still kinda suck...gain muscle takes a way from flexabilty so i seriously need to strech..and i need to learn the Fight Song...i feel so lost when we do that...and i hate yelling...I guess i am not 100% cheerleader! Now i am sore as all hell.... So on with the non cheer life...I went to the Branding Iron last night...which could be why i was so sore today..dancing all night...but i saw these really cute guys and then they came and daned with us..at the end of the night me and my friend... went to go talk to them and they were gone...sucked...but we are goign back on monday so i hope they will be there! I met some guy there from myspace...umm he got there like 10 45 and it closed at 11...so we saw eachother talked for about 3 seconds and then....we left...o well no love match there...ha ha  So update on the boy..hmm..i dunno when this feeling will ever go away...this love shit...i am tired of missing him...but i dunno what else to do...we talked and i was happy to hear from him...but i still miss him...I dunno...hopefully i come to some solid conclusion!...SOON!!! well until another time....
So i am doing this whole meeting new people thing adn ti is kinda akward..I dunno how everything is going to go...I am glad to get a move on with my life....there is so much that I didn't know about life becuase i was stuck with one boy...maybe stuck is not the right word.. becuase i did love this boy...but i was only able to see life through the eyes of a person in love...no that that was so bad just diffrent you know...I get to experience the fullness of life...ya know i am going to beleive that in all thing there is a purpose...so this boy needing his time must be for a reason....maybe he was holding me back....ha ha...which is funny...i dunno..o well....babysitting...and hoping to find a genuine person out there some where...not a boy driven by his little head...if you get my drift...well here is to the luck of a new life...waiting to be comfortable
So let's start off with the most recent events...Cheer...I love stunting...It is so much fun!! I fell 4 times nut it was fine...I had to stunt with a girl i didn't really like and she kept naggign at me about eveything..but whatever...i didn't kick he in the head and she didn't drop me..so o well...I just hope for a diffrent base next time! My body hurts again...sore and now i feel like i need to go work out today!  Ok so let's see I joined the thing on myspace..it is so crazy..like a million new people and i can not even keep track of them...dirty old men..horney lil boys...and guys who think that just cause they say i am beautiful they are going to get laided!! I dunno....well i mean i guess it is a good palce to meet new people! And the boy...oh he made out with the dirty whore...and ok i am over it...he was a lying lil boy anyway and will one day realise he let the best thing go that he will ever have...but high school love never lasts..boys just care about their little head....and are lacking an important organ..a heart..o well pish posh!! Ha ha BOO!! over done wiht can't change the mistakes in the past just got to learn not to make them again! No news on my grandpa...still just waiting..then i wonder is worse knowin someone is going to die or for them just to die?? Well i can tell you both hurt a hell of lot...and all i cna wish for is the best...he stays with us happliy..for as long as he can.... until later
Well this i think over rules the drama in my life...the boys trying to break me heart and the girls trying to ruin everything i have worked for...My gradpa has heart faliure...and basically there is nothing he can do but to sit and wait to die. At the age of 17 i have delt with a lot of death and i think it just makes me realise that a childish heartbreak should be the least of my worries...self-centered young girl...could descirbe my self to the core... too worried about my own sorrows to feel for others...I think i have a new plan...volunteering...I dunno where but maybe it will take up some times...and get me to not be so self centered! Well I think I have made a mistake in something i did last night....but it made me feel alot better...happier...for the moment, becuase i think it can only end much worse then it started.....i guess the only way i will see is in the unfolding of life...dedication to those who have passed: Matt Clark and pj lugo...
ok so now i know he likes her and i think that it set my lil heart free....so here is and add for me.....Jessica is a wonderful, smart, highly emotional girl..searching a stable loving, muscular, handsome, smart, rich(or not but preferably so) guy! Ha ha Well San Diego helped out a lot..time way...freedom...I got sun burned... but it is turning into a tan! So the single life is supposed to be more fun anyway...rihgt girls!! Well at least i am happy now right! Well till the next drama occurs....good luck wishes!
no idea where to start...broken heart is a fact! Ok so i ask the world this question is it love or the brain that moves people? If I am so logical...it s
