Here’s a quick one for you; it’s an opinion and some advice. Now, something we all do when we have a new relationship, normally on the first or second meeting is watch a film, I know its a bit of a wuss out option but we all do it, its easy and we don’t have to worry about making conversation etc etc, also it allows us to do other things if everything’s going well... you know what I’m saying lol. Yep, films are great alright, but when it comes to choosing the actual movie you are going to watch with her/him I think its a very precise art, and when you think about it there’s actually very specific criteria for you to make your choice with. Firstly, you want a comedy, this lightens the mood and makes everyone feel good, generally better about themselves, it also means that the two of you share some laughter, this is a very positive experience, and when you both find something funny it bonds you a little. Also, it will get you both smiling, everyone looks better when they are smiling. Next, and here’s the difficult part, you also want it to have some scary bits in there, this especially applies if your date is a girl, I’m not being sexist but if there’s a bit of gore or something slightly unpleasant her natural instinct is to lean into you for protection etc, we all know how great this is. Finally, the film just needs to be plain good quality, this shows that you have really good taste and can make good decisions etc etc. I think if you follow these rules the two of you will definitely be closer by the end of the movie, literally lol. There really is no better way to get closer to someone you like, and remember, the smaller the sofa the better and make sure its big and squishy. Anyway, bearing all of the above in mind, the best date movie I have found so far is.... The reasonably low budget Brit comedy 'Shaun of the Dead', its worked for me, ill let you read about it for yourselves:  urlLink http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365748/
Well, I read today that the store Dixons is going to stop stocking the game Manhunt, this is because of a recent killing where a teenager wasted another teenager using very similar methods to those in the game, which if anyone doesn’t know features a guy who wanders around a deserted city killing everyone he meets in pretty nasty ways. In fact, I was one of the first people to buy this game, I got it on the day it was released, mostly because of its high quality parentage, Rockstar Games, those responsible for GTA, it is an incredibly good game and I thoroughly enjoyed it, but now fewer people can. Now, everyone thinks that the teenage killer was copying the game, and I’m not going to deny it, in fact it the details sound so much like the game that I’m almost certain that is what he was doing, but does that mean that the majority of people should no longer be able to enjoy it, I’m not one of those people that say games never affect anyone, but there’s maybe one in a billion people that actually acts based on these violent games, for the rest of us, the thought never enters our heads. I think this is really stupid of Dixons, its nothing more than a blatant attempt to win some kudos from the poor delusioned parents desperate to blame something for the fact that their son was essentially just the one weak guy in a sea of stronger people. The very people that now suffer because of it.  urlLink http://www.rockstargames.com/manhunt/
I've been thinking about this recently, what makes us really happy with our life, what are the factors that make us think, my life is really going well, and by extension, what are the factors that make us happy, contented people. Because if i can figure out exactly what the things are that do this for me, I can at least try to work on them, now i dont know if they are the same for everyone, but here are mine, I think. Firstly, I need to have contact with other people, now this may seem obvious, but its a really important one, most people need to be sorrounded by a group of people who will activley try to seek out their company and genuinly like being with them,&nbsp; in other words, a good group of friends, im not just talking one or two, im talking a good sized group, essentially what im saying is i need to feel resonably popular. Secondly, I need to be busy, this may seem obvious to most people as well, but its not easy to see where to draw the line, busy can just mean that you have things to fill your days, that you dont wake up in the morning and struggle to think of a reason to get out of bed, you should always have&nbsp;a reason. I dont know if a hobby counts as this or not, for me a hobbies not essential, but im sure it might&nbsp;be for some people. This leads me to my next point, a job, I need to have a job, not only for practical reasons, like i need the money, but i also just think theres an inbuilt human instinct to want to work, somehow. Next, I need to be fit, this is why I go to the gym, I feel like crap if I dont exercise, this is a very important point, enough said. Lastly I think,&nbsp;and heres the most difficult on of all, I need to have a companion, a girl, this is really important, you need this kind of affection and you're not going to get it from anyone else, you need someone who likes you more than anyone else, someone to share things with etc. Now, heres my point I guess, when you've covered all but o
