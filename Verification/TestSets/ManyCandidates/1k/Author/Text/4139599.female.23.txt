Hey guys, this darwin award is pretty funny.   urlLink www.darwinawards.com/stupid   Click on Lawn Chair Larry.
So I'm talking to Liz last night on the phone, and she tells me to hold on for a second. I say "alright" and when she comes back she says: "sorry, I had to put some water in my bong."  Also, I had to remove the giant picture of the guy with all the piercings, it really freaked out the blog template so that it put all the links at the bottom instead of the side.  And no the picture below is not part of this post!
urlLink    A typical cell phone user at North Lake  So I come into work this afternoon, and see sitting out in front of the circulation counter a large fishbowl with green aquarium rocks in it and what appear to be one or two cell phones, on which is taped a large sign that says "Please turn off cell phones...or deposit them here!!!" Now, most people are not going to want to leave their cell phone in a bowl and out of their reach, let alone in a bowl mixed with other strange phones carrying God only knows what diseases. So one would be led to believe the implication is that we wish you to turn you cell phone off before entering. BUT...that's not what the sign says. Clearly, there are two options, including the option to leave the cell phone in the bowl...with no requirement that it be turned off before it is left in the bowl. So you can, in theory, leave your cell phone in the bowl  turned on . And being as this is a public library I can guarantee that at some point some patron will leave their cell phone in the bowl,  turned on . And naturally, that someone will try to call this clever patron while their phone is in this bowl of phones. And that, upon hearing it ringing, the circulation staff member currently occupying the counter will rush to the bowl and begin cursing frantically as they dig through phones and aquarium rocks to determine which of the phones in the bowl is ringing.  In truth I am not entirely opposed to this plan, as I welcome all arrangements that produce amusement in their absurdity, and the failure of the arranger to be aware of all natural outcomes of their action. It is my fondest wish to see this particular outcome before I leave.
urlLink     The new face of North Lake Library?&nbsp;&nbsp;   For those of you who do not already know, the dream that was the North Lake Community Library is coming to an end. Those brave and dedicated IPL employees that toiled, sweated and cried for the dream of a united Academic/Public library will be scattered like ashes to the wind among the various branches of the Irving Public Library system, broken and allotted like slaves at the auction block under the cruel&nbsp;Alabama sun. &nbsp;Those books which once stood so proudly on our shelves, virtually shouting their vast reservoir of knowledge to our patrons(student and public)will be divvied up like so much pirate treasure booty among the branches of IPL. The children's library, the gleaming jewel in the eye of knowledge that was NLCL, will close, it's lights dimmed forever, no longer able to battle against the ignorance that today runs rampant in the world of the child. Instead what will be left will merely be a shell of its former self, as North Lake college employees take over the many duties they once shared with their comrades-in-arms from IPL, and slave to provide at best 1/2 the service to 1/4 the patrons at 1/8 the level of competence(albeit at 2/3 the price.) Please take a moment to lament the passing of the dream that was NLCL. Alas, poor NLCL, we knew you well...

Women Say Dentist Made Them Swallow Semen  1 hour, 13 minutes ago Add  urlLink Strange News - AP  to My Yahoo! CHARLOTTE, N.C. - Former employees of a dentist claim the man made female patients unwittingly swallow his semen during visits to his office. Dr. John Hall is accused by the state dental board of violating dentistry's standard of care, engaging in immoral conduct, and committing sexual assault or battery.   Six former patients say he tricked them into swallowing his semen. A seventh claims he jumped on top of her in the dental chair and "began to gyrate against her lower body in a sexual manner."  The dental board suspended Hall's license Nov. 5, after police began investigating allegations by two former employees. In February, it conditionally restored his license, barring him from being alone with female patients.  Hall's lawyers say the dentist has been falsely accused by disgruntled former employees. He was collecting his semen because he was taking Propecia, a drug to promote hair growth, and was concerned about potential side effects that include low sperm count and diminished semen, his lawyer, Emerson Thompson, said.  The dental board heard testimony Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The hearing is to continue next weekend.  The five-member panel will decide whether Hall can keep his license. The case is still being investigated by authorities in Charlotte, Cornelius and Mecklenburg County.  Hall's former assistant Cheryl Lynn MacLeod testified Saturday that she found it odd that Hall began asking her to leave a patient's side to retrieve items that he never used.  She also became suspicious when she overheard him tell patients to "swallow" something, and when she saw him take a syringe out of his lab coat pocket while working beside a patient.  In May 2003, she and former office administrator Susie Hillman took the five syringes from office waste containers and Hall's lab coat pockets and gave them to police.  Hall's lawyer, Thompson, suggested the substance Hall asked patients to swallow could have been a dental product.  But in a
