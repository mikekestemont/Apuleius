I'm putting this blog together because of a lack of resources on the internet about pre-commercial thinning or brushing as its called out west. I've been thinning for the last month and am just starting to get experienced enough to make some money. The bugs aren't out too bad yet and I've heard stories about cutting into hornet's nests so we'll see how things go. Below is a little blurb I wrote or  urlLink http://www.replant.ca/board/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=85  concerning the differences between tree planting and thinning.   -------------------------------------------------------------   I can't really speak to comparing planting and brushsaw work but I can vouch for the comment that having a techincal understanding of the saw and how to fix it is important. I work with a guy from Paris France and he couldn't even start the darn thing on our first day but he's still learning and starting to get fast.   In New Brunswick we do pre-commercial thinning which involves cutting everything that's not commercially viable (up to 6" in diameter) and then spacing the rest at 6'. Every vetran I've talked to agrees that the biggest thing to keeping your cutting fast (and making $$$) is being able to sharpen your blade effectively and keep your saw singing. The biggest parts of saw maintenance involve keeping the air filter and spark arrestor clean. Rates around here run about $435/hectare and the blocks are between .5 and 3 hectare each. Lots of guys will travel from province to province around the atlantic region making around $800/week.   Its not really a job to do for the summer because of the big investment needed to get started. Your gear will run around $1500 and you'll beat the living hell our of your truck or you will be paying someone else to ride in theirs. A car will not get you to your block   Anyway... the work's not that hard once you're in shape and you know how to approach your block. If you drop trees in such a way that you never have to walk over them and can do this fast you're laughing. Also, you'll generate a serious hate for maple clumps. I even have a hard time looking at the flag these days. ;-)  Six Tanks of Gas - Pre-Commercial Thinning in New Brunswick - The Blog
Blueish-Black  That's the colour I expect my right shin to turn later tonight or maybe tommorow.  The elastic energy that can be contained in a bowed over tree is truely amazing and sometimes shockingly so.  Our new block is an itty-bitty 1.06 Hectare but the cutting in terrible. I'd say the stand is 20 or more years old so everything is huge and tall, a chainsaw might be a more appropriate weapon.  We put a big dent in it today and hope to be done by the end of Monday.  This block is so bad that alot of guys are just taking the next few days off until we move to a new block.  No truck access, shitty cutting, terrible bugs and just decent pay aren't making anyone too keen.  Whatever, I like the work... burn six tanks of gas and I'm out.  Peace. ~Jeff   Six Tanks of Gas - Pre-Commercial Thinning in New Brunswick - The Blog
Well, we got our last strip done this morning at about 10:30am and headed out to the next block.  Everything was going awesome, I knew the area we were going and got in touch with my foreman in record time.  BUT, we got out there and everyone was sitting on tailgates at the mouth of the road.    It turns out this new block is full size 4x4 territory only. We'd arrived just after the latest rescue mission and no-one was interested in walking in the 3km to the strips.  It was agreed that beer in the afternoon and a 6am meeting the next day for thinner ferry service was the only choice.  Man, loosing a half day is like loosing $60 bucks.  I guess its alright thought. Its only 1 in the afternoon and the warblers are now battling with the chickadees at the feeder next to my computer. What could be more entertaining than a bird fight?

Man, it's not even that hot out yet but work pants and caulk boots are getting pretty uncomfortable. I'm going to be alright though, I think its time to start working in a wife-beater. The bugs are still leaving me alone as long as I'm moving so I don't think being that exposed will be a big problem. What is a big problem right now however is my partner.   For some reason my partner wears the same dark grey SWEATshirt to work everyday. Now, this shouldn't be a problem, except every warm day by about noon he's run out of water and starts drinking mine... now I don't want to sound like an ass but water is my absolute lifeline when working. I can withstand almost any amount of torment while working because I always know that after this tank of gas I can have a nice big cool drink of water.   Well, last week on a particularly huge block we were almost to then end and it was hotter than heck out when I found that my partner had FINISHED my water. I could have killed him.   Today was no different and even though I've told him time and time again that he needs to bring more water with him he hasn't seemed to get the hint. Unfortunately today (after he'd run out of all his gas, another issue) he started drinking my water again. I didn't say anything about it while we were out on the strip because everyone's more irritable when tromping over fallen trees but I let him know without any chance for misunderstanding or interpretation that I wasn't happy about sharing water and that if he ran out tomorrow he could not have any of mine.  It seems really petty but that's just how I feel about it, w
