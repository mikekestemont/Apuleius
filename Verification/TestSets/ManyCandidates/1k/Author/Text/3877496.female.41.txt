You know I'm a big NASCAR fan. Well, if you didn't know it - I am.  In fact, one of my "mid-year" resolutions (thanks Donna!) is to do the Richard Petty Driving Experience before December.  I'm planning to do that in Talladega on August 13.  Yes, that's Friday the 13th!  Anyway, I was reading on NASCAR.com today about one of the drivers who had "brain fade".  He said that he was talking on the radio and just drove into a wall in the garage area.   I probably shouldn't confess this... sometimes I get to work and I don't remember anything about the drive!!  Is that brain fade?  For safety's sake, I'll work on that.  What else don't I remember... and how DID I get to be 41 this quickly?
Our speaker at church last night talked about short term losses and long term gains.&nbsp; The business world understands this but sometimes we just can't see it.&nbsp; He used the parable of the master who forgave his servant's debt.&nbsp; We can't always give up what we want right now because we can't see the long term gain.  I wonder how many blessings I've missed out on because I can't let go of what I've got.&nbsp;&nbsp;God's&nbsp;plan is&nbsp;always best.&nbsp; Why&nbsp; do I insist on trying to tell&nbsp;Him what&nbsp;to do with my life?&nbsp;
What a difference 4/10 of a pound can make!&nbsp; Out of our little group from work that goes to Weight Watchers, I was the winner this week!&nbsp; Last week, I lost 2.4 pounds and left very disappointed. (Brenda lost 5.8)&nbsp; This week, I lost 2.8 pounds, Brenda... not so much.&nbsp; It's so nice to be the winner!&nbsp; Especially at losing! I'm a winning loser!&nbsp; a losing winner?  Donna and I are going to the ZOE public worship in B'ham this weekend.&nbsp; Maybe we should wear our blog names on nametags!  Speaking of Homewood Church of Christ (the location for this weekend's workshop), I went to a wedding there last weekend.&nbsp; They served MILKSHAKES at the reception (I didn't get one, re-read first paragraph) and had fireworks!!!!!!!!&nbsp; Lots of fun!&nbsp; Congratulations Wendy and Joel!  &nbsp;
I watched a show on about cosmetic surgery on TLC tonight called "BodyWork".&nbsp; It was hard to watch the pain and stress these people went through to look better.&nbsp;   Working in a hospital, I've grown accustomed to hearing about various surgeries.&nbsp; As much as I claim to want to look different sometimes, I don't think I'd have anything done.&nbsp; I'm too scared of pain, I guess.&nbsp; I kinda like me, even the scar on my nose.&nbsp; Liposuction is tempting but...  What would you have done?&nbsp;
This morning, I will be leading the discussion in Bible Study about loving our enemies.&nbsp; I automatically say that I have no enemies.&nbsp; Even those people that I don't like... I don't wish harm to them.&nbsp; Do I love them?&nbsp; What is love?  People love in different ways.&nbsp; Some use words, some give gifts and some perform services for those they love.&nbsp; All of these forms of love are actions.&nbsp; Those people that I don't like - I don't hate them but, I don't like them.&nbsp; I'm obviously not loving them either because I'm not acting.&nbsp; Love is not so much a feeling as an action.  I will begin by praying for the desire to love those I don't like.&nbsp; That's the strongest action I can take!
I'm reading a book entitled,"Fast Forward".&nbsp; It's about a girl who has amnesia and doesn't remember ANYTHING.&nbsp; She reads old diaries to find out about her life and even has to go to the library and courthouse to find out about a divorce!&nbsp; I wonder what I would find out about myself if I didn't know me.&nbsp; If I woke up in my house and didn't know who&nbsp; I was.&nbsp; I have lots of pictures of family and friends, I have a hideously messy basement, there is NO food in my refrigerator.&nbsp; I would probably be as amazed as I am now that I wrote down all my Weight Watchers points last week and still only lost 2.4 pounds! Would I know that I have to teach "The Sisters" class on Sunday and I haven't read my chapter?&nbsp; Oooops.... gotta go catch up on my reading!!!!!!!!!
Our ladies ministry at church, WWF (Women Working In Faith) was sponsoring a school supplies drive for our community.&nbsp; We usually plan a little activity to add some fun.&nbsp; Bowling For Bloomers (a drive for underwear for our abused women and children's charity) went over so well, we thought we'd try Bowling For Backpacks.&nbsp; The fun of Bowling For Bloomers was watching the face of the gentlemen making the announcements that Sunday!&nbsp; Anyway, Donna and I were the only ones who showed up to bowl.&nbsp; Our friend, Sharon, came later but we had left.&nbsp; So, we automatically started thinking of things we had done wrong, not enough publicity, announcing the wrong date... but you know, it's not about me.&nbsp; Other people may actually have lives that include activities other than the ones I have a part in planning! &nbsp; ...could it be that the women don't want to be a part of something called WWF?&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;
Things I'm thankful for today:   A wonderful time of worship at CrossBridge  A wonderful friend with whom I shared that worship time  The beautiful, sunny sky  Lunch for only 6 points, maybe less  A 13 -3 win for the Underwood All-Stars  2 triples by my favorite All-Star  An awesome God who&nbsp; gives all these gifts
It's payday!&nbsp; Every couple of weeks I get that reminder that I'm doing a good job.&nbsp; Not only do I like rules, as I have previously stated, I like prizes!&nbsp; I go to the mailbox, first thing, when I get home.&nbsp; I even flip through the sales papers.&nbsp; If it is in my box, I'm glad to get it! &nbsp; I like the little paydays that God sends us.&nbsp; Everyday, there is something to remind me of how much he thinks of me.&nbsp; Sometimes I get funny things, sometimes beautiful things - I even get t
