One day when I was a unbeliever, I committed many different kinds of sins. Any kind that you can even think of. We are all like that. I went to church because my father forced me to by using is health.  After attending many services in that charismatic church, my soul profiteth nothing. Then my father brought me to another church. It is a reform church. There is discipline in the church during worship services.  Then my soul slowly began to profit. During that time, I was still like the worldly people, like everybody else. After attending many services, I began to change my everything such as personality, behaviour, attitute, etc. During the changing process. I am partly of my old self. Although i struggled through many kinds of temptation, most of the time i still ended up committing those sins.  After sometime, there was a division in the church, due to the perfect bible stand. The people, who believes that the bible is perfect and has no mistake, were seperated from those who did not. I missed those fellowship with like-minded brethren, hoping to have fellowship with them in future again. Those people taught and helped me in times of difficulties. But still I follow those believe in the perfect bible. The world may think that this is meaningless, but we ought to follow the instruction of the bible.  Currently, I am worshipping in RELC. Many months has past, but still i miss them. Not long ago, the church organised a church camp in Malaysia. I joined to learn more spiritual things.   During the camp, I found that those sins which i committed in the past, shall not let me enter into heaven. And what must we do to obtain salvation. There was a great revival in me. I felt remorse, guilt, ashamed of all my sins. I prayed the sinners' prayer, confessing all my sins, and also prayed for repentances and hoping to be a better christian. After learning many things, I officially announced that I am borned again.(spiritual being)  After sometime my fruits which I bear will becoming more and more evil. Until I committed a sin which shall not let me enter to heaven. I am not difference from the world. Currently, I am hoping for more self-discipline, better behaviour whether be it in school or at home or anywhere, humility, change of my attitute and thinking towards God, my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.

From the day that he was born he committed sins. what are those sins? well they are many kinds of sins and some of them are the seven deadly sins. what are they?  They are:  7 Deadly Sins (I)  Text: Proverbs 6:16-19  -envy-pride-lust-gluttony-slothfulness-wrath-covetousness-  *	proud look: pride *	lying tongue: lies *	hands that shed innocent blood: *	heart that devises wicked things: scheming *	feet swift in running to mischief: causing trouble *	false witness:  *	soweth discord among brethren: gossip  God hates these characteristics. They are an abomination unto Him.  *	There is no sin that is less deadly or more deadly *	These 7 sins are the cause of many other sins. [root sins] *	If a person has all these things, it may destroy him. *	We are to walk circumspectly. [Ephesians 5:15-16] *	Theologians talked about it…complied it, popularising it. *	Closely related to the Roman Catholics. Venial Sins = not so bad. Cardinal Sins = cannot be forgiven. *	They believe that some sins are worse than other sins. *	Popularised by literature and Church Fathers. The Bible also mentions these sins. *	In Christian Theology, not really true.  Gluttony Text:  *	Deuteronomy 21:20 *	Proverbs 23:21  Note: *	The word appears only twice in the Bible. *	He doesn’t care; he wants to live it up. However, it doesn’t only refer to eating, as long as it can ensnare us, it’s bad.  Deuteronomy 21:20 *	Harsh punishments. [disobedience] *	Stubborn rebellion associated with glutton. *	Something that controls our life, addiction. e.g. computers, food, talking on the phone, ect…  An example of a Glutton *	Luke 15:11-32 [the parable of the lost son] *prodigal = glutton *	(vs.13) “wasted his substance with riotous living” = excessive *	Result: (vs.14) He will eventually become poor and lack all that he needs. *	It is deadly towards others and towards us. e.g. live, eat, breathe, drink the obsession. *	Long term effect: sapping our energy. *	Glutton is also Lazy.  Laziness  Sloth *	It is an animal that is extremely slow and lazy.  *	The record speed is ½ km in one day.  *	Is able to spend an entire life-time in a tree. *	The sloth is so idle that green algae grows on fur, as it is too lazy to wash itself. *	Primary occupation: eating *	Eating: so slothful that sometimes when looking for food, it’ll die of starvation. *	It dies hanging on trees, skeletons.    Proverbs 6:6 “Go to the ant thou sluggard; consider her ways and be wise.”  Slothful: no motivation and energy to do anything else.  Proverbs 26:15-16 “The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom; it giveth him to bring it again to his mouth. The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason.”  Ecclesiastes 10:18 Proverbs 18:9  How do we apply it to ourselves? *	It is vain to wake up early and sleep too late. [Proverbs 24:23-24] *	Sleeping too much is also bad. [Proverbs 6:9-11] *	They are deadly sins because we see the consequences.  Psalms 127:2 “It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows, for so he giveth his beloved sleep.” =)   7 Deadly Sins (II)  Covetousness  Covet // Greed: excessive desire to acquire. Inordinate desire for things belonging to another. e
