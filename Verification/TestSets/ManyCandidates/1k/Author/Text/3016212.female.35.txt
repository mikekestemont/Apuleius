CHANGES ( BY 3 DOORS DOWN )
Im not supposed to be scared of anything /But I dont know where I am
I wish that I could move but Im exhausted /And nobody understands ( how I feel ) /Im trying hard to breathe now/ But theres no air in my lungs/Theres noone to talk to/ And the pain inside is making me numb/Try to hold this under control/You cant help me because noone knows/Now Im going thru changes,, changes/God I feel so frustrated /When I get suffocated save me
Now Im going thru changes,, changes/Feelin weak and weary/ Walkin thru this world alone/ Everything they say, every word of it/Cuts me to the bone ( and I bleed )/Ive got something to say/ But now Ive got nowhere to turn/
It feels like Ive been buried/Underneath the weight of the world/I try to hold this under control......
and thus the song repeats it self for the most part .I love the music of 3 Doors Down. I remeber one nite ( while i was flying high ) I was working in the biggest strip club in the city on a saturday nite at midnight . I was on stage in a showclub dress ( sexy ) with a thong that barely covered all the appropriate places & 8 inch heels ( i love platforms , the bigger the better )
I was on stage under a bright spotlight in the middle of the club high above all the partiers , socialites  , couples exploring their sexuality and whatnot of other onlookers. The club was packed so full that there was no longer standing room only , I remembered excitement and fear of hearing my name called from the dj booth that I was up now to strip off this $200.00 show girl dress which would soon be laying on the floor crumpled into a mess. ( just like me ) I was beyond being capable of getting up from my table of who I cant say ( I protect thier names ) & actually walking up those stage slippery steps & onto an even slicker ( oil from previous dancers ) stage & attempting to look sexy & coherent . I managed amazingly to do so & feeling quit accomplished with that , proceeded to strip for 2songs in front of more than 200 ppl. I literally felt time stand still and the room go in slow motion or my brain that is . I remember the looks on all the faces & the drunken smiles & laughter .  I also remember thinking " what the hell am I doing ?" " who am i ? " had i really come so far that I had actually in my life managed to go backwards .. was this it ? was this what i was ? AND what was I ? ,,, a fading object of sexiness til the next dancer held my hand and walked me off stage , as we all did when it was our turn. I used to think  thank god that I lived in the VIP room & could avoid the stage when my friend would come in a few times a week to see my girlfriend and I whom I miss dearly. ( she still dances ) and of course a dancer doesnt have time for a non-dancer. ( plus we keep different schedules ) I must be addicted to the sexiness of it all, and well the drugs too which is exactly why I dont do them....... I refuse to give away or sell all my dancer costumes - I like to look at them - SEE that is the exact type of thinking that I need to steer clear of.  I am a battle with myself. BEING ME SUX. I remember woman talking to me while I stripped about wanting and having the courage to do it themselves. COURAGE didnt make me strip , survivng made me strip, the fear of no money and being broke and homeless made me strip & with money YOU can look real good & make more money .. sorry but its true. Its amazing what money can do , if you use it right. What noone seems to get in the war of good and evil is that evil money doesnt last and no good money is invested from it. I knew one girl who escorted and prostituted on the side(whatever you want to call it ) AND she made tons of money BUT i always thought when she found the love of her life, would he accept her after she had been with so many other men ? Would he think her to be of any quality ? or just another splunker ( splunking). The money she made and had I did not envy( my imagination runs wild with  the idea of what she must of gone thru to earn it ) .....and well i shudder. SO i ask is there any "just sexy" for hire...... I think that is what got me in all this trouble to begin with, I used to tell my guy while i got ready for work - "i just wish we were amazingly rich and didnt have to work & everyday I could dress up like this just for you." ............ he said "me too, baby ,, me too " When our relationship was young and fresh and new we used to dance for each other and seduce each other AND it was awesome..................Now w
