Whats wrong with me. The gift from Hell I guess. I just am no good with girls period. Like a mental block or something. The one good thing that happened today is I got tickets to the Yellowcard concert with Stacey. It's not that I expected her to agree with what I said in my blog but I am just frustrated and I know it isn't her fault and I am not mad at her but I wish she knew how I felt. I think I love her and I am not just saying that.
The Yankees home opener was today! Since they are playing in Japan I had to wake up at 6:00 this morning and it was already the 6th inning lol. They lost 8-3 though....oh well. I guess Stacey didn't think my idea was so good because she didn't say anything and I know from experience that when they don't bring it up, it probably means no. Maby I am wrong though. Well, atleast I tried right? I don't think we will be going to the concert because there are only 100 tickets left.
Today was cool. I actually look forward to school now. Just to see my friends though. Ok Stacey. Lemme tell you what I think. There's what.... a month and a half left of school right? So if we did go out and you ended up like hating my guts then you would never have to see me again. If it was a good thing then we would have a nice few months and we would keep in touch. Even though you leaving would suck atleast we tried it out right? Well I wish you would give me atleast a chance, eh? Think about it! Bye. Oh and my parents said the concert would be ok. Yay!
My uncle is visiting! Just visited with him all day. Yes Stacey, Lynerd Skynerd is cool.
It's finally the weekend! I slept late, watched T.V., and did nothing all day though I did play with my dog lol. I wish I could have hung out with like Chad or something but I never got around to calling anybody. Anthony is spending the night so that should be fun...I guess. I have known him since second grade but I seem to not be as friendly with him anymore. He is getting kind of immature I guess. Well I better go because he is here now.
Hello. OMFG I am so pissed! In my guitar class our teacher is so dumn. She gave us this long ass project. We had to pick a guitarist (I picked Dimebag Darrel from Pantera.) and we have to right a two-page report about him. Plus we have to bring all this other crap. I thought we were supposed to learn GUITAR in GUITAR class! If I could, I would leave her class because I know the basics and I get private lessons at George's which is fun.  Atleast I got to leave school early but even then I missed the one class I happen to like. Mr. Moser. I had to go to the orthidontist to get my braces cranked. lol. He put on this blue wire and i'm not sure if I like it or not. Oh crap! I just realized I have math homework. What a great day. Oh and if y'all wonder why I type so proper and all, I don't know why, I just do.
Bored. That is how I feel right now. I just finished dinner and am waiting for someone, anyone to get online. The lady at La Piaza is a dumbass. My mom ordered a pizza with half cheese and half pepperoni. The lady was like "We put cheese on ALL of our pizzas so you really want to say that you want just a pizza with half pepperoni." No shit. I mean really, what a ignoramus. That is probably the longest word I have said in a while. For all you slower folks out there, an ignoramus is an idiot.
First day back. It was easy and we did no work all day. I was happy to see Tim and the rest of 'em. I was glad that I got an A on my Holocaust packet. That means I will get like 8 A's added to my grade. We had a new wheel teacher today. I'm not sure how to spell his name but I think it is Mr. Moser. He teaches Languages. We are gonna learn like 5 languages. Stacey had an...interesting evening but i'm not getting into that.
I couldn't write in my blog yesterday because I spent the night at my friends house but it didn't matter, nothing happened the whole day anyway. I am happy because it turns out my grandma didnt have a stroke. They still aren't sure what happened but atleast it wasn't a stroke. Whenever I get online nobody is ever on. I cant even go read my own blog because AOL is too gay. When I try to read it the parental control thing blocks it. If my dad types in his password it will let me go but then I think he is able to go to it also and I dont want him reading it because it is none of his business. lol. Tomorrow is the day we go back to school which I guess is good because I get to see my friends again. Plus, I miss Stacey (HINT HINT). Nothing really else to talk about but I may post later or tomorrow.
I am happy to be back home. Visiting my grandparents was ok, I would just rather be home with my friends. Hey Stacey guess what. I had waffles for breakfast yesterday. I even got a little freaky and added some syrup! lol. Over the week we just went shopping and drove around to different places. Like 40 minutes after we got home my grandpa called and said my grandma was in the emergency room and he thinks she may have had a stroke! Can you believe that shit!
Today was a p
