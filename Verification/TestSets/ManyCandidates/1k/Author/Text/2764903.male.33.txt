This is the sickest thing I have ever read and I feel very, very skeevy, as if I have walked through spider webs and can't seem to get them off of me. What the hell is wrong with people? Do people have that much insanity and free time to go through with  urlLink this . (By the way, this is not for the squeemish, but it is really news.)
Author and attorney Scott Turow discusses the American legal system and all of the above mentioned subjects in a very  urlLink good article from the Guardian . Turow recounts the events, evidence, and the politics behind the false conviction of a Hispanic man in the murder of a 10-year-old girl in Illinois.
Here is the ugly truth about performing beyond the expectations of your higher-ups; you will ultimately be fired or eliminated. Just like this  urlLink poor schmuck from Sweden .  This is a point I have seen illustrated, not only in real life, but in the movies, also. Like when Colin Farrel's character in  urlLink Minority Report , who is the only person doing his job perfectly, gets a bullet in the head from Max Von Sydow's character for all of his brilliance and hard work.  Remember to always perform at your expectation level and to never stand out or look too good, for fear of them cutting you out of the herd for slaughter (or unemployment).
After dealing with salesman, mechanics, and my own gnawing sense of dread over my crapped-out car that seemed to permeate my entire existence, I decided to treat myself to a viewing of  urlLink Open Range  along with some whiskey and Mike & Ike's candy.   Go rent Open Range. Robert Duvall is awesome in it and everyone else is great. And the gunfight at the end is very realistic, almost as if you were watching parts of it on the news (if they had had the technology back then). There is also an interesting and entertaining piece on the making of the movie, that is almost like Costner's video diary of the entire project, that is on the Special Features disk.  Good stuff.
My car's clutch just went this morning on the way to work. Great. I had a feeling it was going to go yesterday on my way home from class, during which I had to stop and feed the beast oil becasue it is leaking in several different places and demands the black giver of life be poured into its guts as payment and supplication for geting me to work every bloody day. My ten year-old piece of crap with no air and a blue book value of nada on a trade-in is useless and I am stuck here at home searching for a good deal on the net and in the newspaper.  I am so f-ed...crap.
Came home from C++ class and I am all wired and can't sleep.  What does one do when you can't sleep? Read more computer books and comics. Greeeeaat...
urlLink The Hotel Langlois . We saw this place in the movie  The Truth About Charlie , the remake of  Charade  that starred Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant. Jacqui checked it out on the web and lookee at that, it's a real hotel.   I'll be meeting the Stenarts team while in Paris to further discuss Hotchpotch and some other projects we have cooking.
urlLink Never mind about those WMDs!  It's time to get all warm and fuzzy about how we liberated their oil - I mean people.
If you've visited my other  urlLink site , you have seen my tirade against Best Buy for their terrible customer service and their lying and deal-breaking. Today, I will tell you about my experiences with Adelphia, the cable and ISP company.    Now I had Adelphia provide my digital cable and DSL line for a decent price, until November of 2003, when I received a notice that they were hiking the rates in my region.  Now I had signed up for a package that said  I was to have digital cable, HBO, and DSL for a set price for 1 year, and my year was not up until March of 2004.  I called said company and waited on hold for about 15 minutes, after which some guy in their Pennsylvania call center tells me that my area is no longer competitive and that his company, Adelphia, should still honor our agreement.  But there was nothing he could do about it, I had to call my local reps.  Great, another half-hour of my life I will never get back.    I call my local center, do my obligatory 15-20 minute hold-the-line and listen-to-shite-music-and-ads until some woman lets me speak to her. After forty minutes I iron out the fact that Adelphia may have made that agreement with me for a year of set prices, but I didn't have any proof and there was no mention of it in my file-how very f-ing convenient. But behind door number two, I am told that I will have to only pay for the price of my digital cable for December and that the DSL will be free. They only ask that I consider keeping the HBO at the increased rate, which I tell them I would do because  urlLink Carnivale  had three more episodes and my wife and I had to see the finale (I know, it was like crack and I was addicted). In other words, "Yeah, we broke the deal  and you're screwed because you can't do anything about it, but here's a little gift-now please go away and remember to give us your money for sub-par customer service and an average product.  Buh-bye."                Oh, but it does not end there friends.    I get my stupid bill from the stupid company and the adjustments to the bill are not on there.  I call these a-holes again, hold for 15 minutes again, and then have to reiterate the past two conversations I have had with Adelphia, and after another hour of back-and-forth bickering, I am told that although there is no record of t
