Thanks for the invitation :)
it is dark.......no she is wrong its more than dark its that total darkness... black ubchanged by shades of grey, she can detect no break in the surounding inky black... scared and nervous she assess' her body from head to toe.... starting at her eyes she believes she is blinking can feel her lids drop and rise of her lids....slowly she listens head cocked to one side.......... .hearing the pounding of her heart , her blood rushing through her body sounds like the echo in a shell when placed to an ear, tongue slips out and moistens lips a sigh escapes her as she realises her mouth is unbound.. swallowing ... eyes widening in the dark as she feels a constriction against her throat.... raising a hand feeling a weight at her wrist also she brings both hands together allmost in prayer as she caress each metal band surrounding her wrist's, feeling eyes dampen with tears slender hand reach and investigate her throat... fingers moving over the metal not yet warmed by her skin......sighing she alters position slightly she is curled allmost featolly the surface beneath hard and ungiving....turning to her back and stretching limbs feet touching a barrier smooth and well warn... moving her toes she discovers bars ....hands risinf over head she discovers yet more bars, crying freely she rises to knee's, knowing she is caught beyond a shadow of escape back straight she places one foot flat and presses upwards as if to stand, her body half straight BANG a small cry more of shock than pain as her head connects with what must be the roof of her place inprisonment Sobbing quietly... body and mind in termoil she sits in a corner braced by the very bars that hold her captive... eyes furtively searching the darkness still total not a crack showing a break for a window or the seam of a door.

Light sudden and bright shocks her awake, jumping allmost to her knees the chains that restrain and attach her to the prison jingling angrily, eyes paining in the sudden glare she looks slowly around her seeing no one, eyes growing uccastomed to the light she studies the walls.. gasping at what she see's. The walls are covered in wrack after wrack of wood holding all kinds of what she recognizes as whips and other tools of punishment... looking further she is afraid as she things she can imagine the use of b
