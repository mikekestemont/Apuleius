the truth about mars  I knew  urlLink it !
quote du jour   "There are 10 types people in this world....those who understand binary, and those that don't"  -- a co-worker.
unwired  My brother asked me to give back his ethernet router (after "borrowing" it for the last 2 years :) ), and so I bought myself a wireless router from  urlLink future shop  for $50 (after rebate). Setup was a breeze. Its only got 802.11b, but its all I need...and you can't beat the price.   I've used wireless before at airports, but I still find it totally cool to be able to plunk down on the couch or bed and work on my laptop without that stupid wire. I'm **so** much more productive now!! ;-)
Transformers...more than meets the eye!!   Come on, what little boy didn't like the  urlLink Transformers ?   I used to wake up by 7:30am every morning to   catch the cartoon  (which was followed by Tom & Jerry and the Jetsons!!). Every time Christmas or a Birthday came around, I asked mom and dad for a new Transformer toy. (i no longer to that anymore...). I didn't have a very large collection, but I had the classics...Optimus Prime, Megatron, Starscream, Bumblebee, Soundwave, Metroplex and Astrotrain. But I thought the coolest one of all was   urlLink Omega Supreme  ! Seems like the Transformers are going through a renaissance of sorts, as Hasbro is bringing back the Originals to mark the 20th year anniversary. I REALLY didn't like those prehistoric or dinosaur transformers -- and now they have the Alternators, which are in the form of cars like the Impreza, Jeep and Corvette... cool, but not as cool as the Originals...    What were your favorite Transformers?
stirring controversy  Mel Gibson's new movie,  urlLink Passion of the Christ , which gives a stirring account of Jesus' last 12 hours of life, opened today in theatres. The timing of release is uncanny, not just because its Ash Wednesday, but because I've been re-examining my own faith and spirituality over the last couple months. I've been talking to Catholics and Christians, reading books and articles, and I've probably come up with as many questions as I have gotten answers. The movie has been stirring controversy for the past year, as many have branded the movie anti-semitic (even though it hadn't been shown yet!) -- something which Gibson denies. I'll watch the movie and decide for myself, but from what I can see, it is purely   one   man's interpretation of an event that occurred 2000 years ago. Like any other historical event, there can be multiple interpretations. Gibson just wanted to share his interpretation and let people question and decide for themselves. Judging by the controversy and flurry of media attention..i think he's already succeeding.
destined to become introverts??   As the usage of electronics communications (e-mail, chat rooms, instant messengers, text messaging, etc) skyrockets, you have to wonder what its going to do to our "in-person" social skills. Most forms of electronic communication gives people a sense of anonymity and security that allows even the most shy person to reach out to anyone in the world.  But is it possible that electronic comms can develop shyness in people because they no longer get much chance to communicate through traditional means such as in meetings (one-on-one or group) or over the phone? I mean, there's no denying that its easier to talk to a total stranger (or someone you just met) through e-mail or IM. What's the extreme? Could we evolve into a society where in-person contact is avoided..and everyone is introverted by nature?
maybe some other time   A planned business trip to Israel has been cancelled. I had been looking forward to the trip with both excitement and some anxiety. But I'm not too disappointed because, after all, Israel has been the center of intense, violent religious conflict for many years -- not exactly the best environment for foreigners. Coincidentally, there was yet another suicide bombing on a bus in Jerusalem killing 8 people. Given that most suicide bombers target public buses, I'm amazed by how the Israeli public still continue to use buses despite the danger. I suppose that the Israelis have learned to live with such a risk, thereby refusing to let terrorists control their lives.
Doesn't it bug you when you see someone who's face you recognize cuz you know you've met before, and yet you can't put a name to their face? I saw this girl last weekend at church, and it irked me that I remembered her face, but not the name. I think she noticed my not-so-subtle stares (i suspect she was thinking the same thing). I guess I could have approached her and used the classic "Don't I know you from somewhere..." line, but it sounded cheesy at the time...and i still wasn't positive if it was the same girl i recognized. ANyways..to keep a short story short, she approached ME today and asked me if I worked at Spectrum, which I said yes. Turns out she was friends with my other friends who works with me, and we had all gone bowling as a group a couple years ago....   yah. that's all i really had to say.
I just spent over an hour cleaning my kitchen. Its become a weekly ritual. Its amazing how quickly the dishes pile up in the sink (and on the counter), and the garbage starts bursting at the seams. I've made a mental note to myself that if something ever explodes in the microwave...wipe it up RIGHT away!   By the way, when the food package says "Best Before 14-Feb-2004" does that mean you throw it away after Feb 14? I suspect most people do, but is it really that bad for you? Who and how is this date determined?
awwwwessome..   Its days like today that make you just love living in   Vancouver . Its a perfect place for the person who loves the city life, but craves nature and the great outdoors. THere aren't very many cities in the world that have sandy beaches, grandiose snow-capped mountains, and an a
