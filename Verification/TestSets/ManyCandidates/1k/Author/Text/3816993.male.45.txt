I came across an intriuging recent article in the Washington Post (by way of  urlLink Religion News Blog ) regarding how young adult-aged children of immigrants are attempting to both respect their religion of Islam while acclimating to the culture of modern Italy.  One young man, quoted in the article, stated:   "I find that Italians accept you as an individual," said...Sabhe Ayoub, a young Palestinian refugee from Gaza, "They accept us more than we would if they migrated to our countries. The hostility after Sept. 11? Some of it is understandable. But some of it is a political game of people trying to win votes at our expense. We just want to get along."   It's interesting to read Ayoub's assertion that he and his peers find more tolerance and acceptance in the west while douting that similar young adults from the west would find the same where he came from.  Although President Bush was very clear that Moslems and individuals of Arab descent were not to be persecuted after the horrible events of September 11th, time after time I have heard and read of ongoing problems here in the U.S. Perhaps some of this is understandable given that those of us in the west have had little to no exposure to people raised and/or practicing their Islamic faith.  I've never been to Italy so I can not write from experience. However, based on conversations with my Italian-language tutor, who is a native of Italy, it seems that Italians are not quite used to having to deal with large numbers of immigrants as we have here in the States. And yet, here in this article, several young adult Moslems are quoted as stating that they find a level of tolerance and acceptance in Italy that prompts within them a desire to embrace some of its ways. I can't recall ever having read or heard the same from similar young adults who were born and raised here in the States. Is there a fundamental cultural difference between the U.S. and, for example, a culture such as Italy when it comes to an overall attitude of tolerance and acceptance (at least towards those who practice a different religious faith)?  In any event, it seems that where tolerance and acceptance abound the temptation to embrace a more extremist world view tends to diminish.
Last night my brother Luigi and I watched part of the  urlLink Democratic Convention  (he needed some "hope" given how he's  urlLink  feeling   about the present administration). One of the first speakers was former Vice President Al Gore. To my surprise he was actually quite funny and appeared more relaxed than usual.   During his speech he made an appeal to disaffected Republicans to consider voting across party lines. He then said something that surprised me:   urlLink  I also ask tonight for the help of those who supported a third party candidate in 2000.  I urge you to ask yourselves this question:  do you still believe that there was no difference between the candidates?    Although he never mentions Ralph Nader or the Green Party by name, the implication is obvious. I was one of those who supported a third party candidate in 2000. I have some of the same concerns about the U.S.' two party system as I had back then, but I recently found the site  urlLink Greens for Kerry . There is an interesting quote from Medea Benjamin, whom I admire, who ran for the U.S. Senate here in California. She states:   In the swing states, where this election's going to be determined, [Greens should] recognize that we owe it to the global community to get rid of George Bush. And if people in those swing states support that strategy of getting rid of George Bush, than voting for Kerry might be the strategic vote for them."   Well, I can say one thing for President Bush and his administration: it certainly has helped, sans Nader and his campaign, unite progressives and liberals in this country in a way that I haven't seen in some time.
Here are  urlLink queries  from Pacific Yearly Meeting and North Carolina Yearly Meeting (Conservative) regarding Meeting for Worship:   Pacific Yearly Meeting :  Q. Do I come to Meeting with heart & mind prepared for worship? Q. In both silent and vocal ministry, do I respond to leadings of the Holy Spirit, without pre-arrangement and in simplicity and truth? Q. Am I careful not to speak at undue length or beyond personal spiritual experience?   Q. Do we meet in expectant waiting for the promptings of the Divine Spirit? Q. Are we drawn together in a living silence by the power of God in our midst?   (queries in italics are for the Meeting as a community)   North Carolina Yearly Meeting (Conservative) :  1. Do we faithfully uphold our testimony for worship which is based on silent waiting, and for a free and unprogrammed ministry that may be shared by all? Is there a living silence in which we feel drawn together by the Light of Christ, the power of God in our midst; and is this inspiration carried over into our daily lives? Do we come to meeting with hearts and minds open and ready to worship in silence or in vocal ministry or prayer as the Holy Spirit leads us? Does our Meeting encourage those who may have a gift in the spoken ministry?  2. Are we faithful in our attendance at meetings for worship and are we careful not to disturb the spirit of the meeting by our late arrival? Is our behavior therein that of open submission to God in silent communion?  [NCYM's  Faith & Practice  is  urlLink online .]
No, silly, not the  urlLink Tour de France , but my vacation back to the northeast for two weeks.   Yep, I'll be visiting my hometown of  urlLink Rochester, NY  for a week, then a long weekend in  urlLink Albany, NY  (where I lived for over nine years), and then end the "tour" with a visit on the  urlLink Cape  with a dear friend of mine.   I doubt I
