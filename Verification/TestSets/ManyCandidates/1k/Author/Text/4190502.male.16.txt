Oh dear me... I managed to pull the stupidest stunt ever!!! And it was painful... So I was bussing a tray back to the kitchen and I moved over so Duron could move something heavy... When I moved over, I bashed into the door and a mug of hot coffee spilled all over me. I wanted to scream but I could not since it was in the middle of dinner... I went back to the kitchen after emptying the tray and started to scoop some coffee yogurt when Mike of all people asked what happened... When I told him he actually cared, he told me to go to out patient because we did not want anything to get worse and wanted to make sure it wasn't a bad burn. So I went to out patient and they said that they could not treat it they could only look at it because of work man comp or something like that. I said that was okay seeing I was not gonna go anyway, she said it was red and it would prolly be a blister, and to have my mom look at it right away because we might have to go to the e.r. When I got back Mike was waiting for me, I was totally stunned, I was like!?!?!? He asked me how everything worked out and I told him the exact same thing.... That I had to show my mom and such... And all the work mans comp...So he walked me back to the kitchen and we chatted and then we had to fill out the workman comp papers and the Beaumont incident report....All in All I am ok but totally baffled, that Mike totally changed... it is so weird... I've been praying and all but I did not know that It would happen that quick!!!! God really does answer prayer... So now that Mike and me are buddies as he says... I think I will be fine working in the kitchen with him....Maybe...
I am starting a new diet...Its called the Matt diet, I made it up, madam Truffle said that some of the others like Atkins are not good for you. Heres My Diet...  1 to 2 bowls of cereal in the morning, with 2% milk, and orange juice 1- .5 liter bottle of water A sandwich or cereal for lunch 1- .5 liter bottle of water A granola bar for snack, and Cranberry Juice 1- .5 liter bottle of water Family Dinner, smaller portions, Ice Tea 1- .5 liter bottle of water so I am trying to drink 2 liters of water a day at least and trying to do 50 sit-ups in the morning and 50 before bed. I am using the Tabeo video my dad has also and my sisters DDR pad for work outs...It makes it fun.
Ok, whoever came up with the stupid night in the orient idea at work, should be fired! Or at least talked to. I had to wear a hat! One of those stupid looking ones....AHHH.... I should have throne it into Rocko's deep fryer along with the french fries and the stupid umbrella we had. GRRR... Not to mention the fact that the sushi smells sooo bad (gag gag) and the fans, those little paper ones, yeah you know. And then all the residents saying how cute we all looked, this thing was a fiasco and a half. ERR... LOL...TTYL
Hello my fellow bloggers. We are getting new carpet tomorrow...O Phooy! I don't like this, we are getting all new stuff, the only new stuff I like is new computers/technology. I had work today, Mike was back :( but he was nice to me suprisingly, he actually asked how I was!!! Maybe he's just getting used to me. I had pepper steak for dinner, my mom made it, it was very good. She brought Arlene and Luke, the security guards some into Beaumont, they liked it too. Well good night!
I am really tired today. I fell asleep at 8:30 last night and woke up at 4:30, 5:00 this morning. I could not get back to sleep, so I figured I would do something, so I watched the TV. I saw the Olympics live, instead of the junky re-run stuff at 9:00 at night. It has been a very long day too, with no nap in between. I had to go to church at 6:30. Then I had to run the second service computer stuff, after the first service, so it was like non-stop power-point. AHHH! And then I went to Uncle Mikes surprise party, he turned 50. YAY! It was the first get together without me-mom though :( ... I had coke, and sprite, and hot fudge sundays, and pasta and roast beef...mmm it was good. Well I'm gonna go...TTYL
This is my first Saturday off in a very long time. Right now I wish I am at work, because I am very bored and want the money, but at the same time I like being bored because it is so relaxing. :) tomorrow is church and I am gonna have to run the computer for second service, but that means I am gonna have to miss Sunday school, and I don't want to. Well I am getting very sleepy, and its only 8:10, I had to take some Benadril because my allergies were bothering me so much! I hate allergies. Where is all this rain that we are supposed to be getting. Some hurricane.... The nerve of those weathermen, I can stand outside and stay completely dry... Oh well.... TTYL....
Me and my brother went to Applebees with Deidra and my cousin Brian. It was a lot of fun. I love doing stuff like that and getting to hang out with people I haven't seen in awhile. It was weird my brother actually asked me to go! I had a bacon cheeseburger (plain) and a Pepsi witch was not a good idea now I am gonna be up all night. Arg! It was so funny, Brian ordered potato skins and a side o
