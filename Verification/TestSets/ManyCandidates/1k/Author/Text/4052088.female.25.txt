7.31.04  Last night I did something I have always wanted to do – I played in the rain.  When we left the club, it was pouring outside.  We sort of looked at it and I said, “you wanna do it?” with a huge smile on my face.  The four of us looked at each other and all agreed…definitely!    It was an amazing feeling – a little cold at first.  But, in 30 seconds, we were thoroughly wet.  I knew that my mascara had already begun to stream down my face, but I actually didn’t care (this is  huge  for me).  I let my hair down, opened my arms and faced upwards to feel the rain…mmm.  It was like something straight out of a movie.
7.29.04  The other night when we were lying on your couch and I was gently petting Java it dawned on me: you are definitely a dog and I am definitely a cat.&nbsp;   You once asked me which of the two I would be.&nbsp; You said that we choose the animal we associate with and consider to have the same characteristics we have ourselves.&nbsp; But, I would argue that we choose the animal we wish we were more like because we admire the way they are.&nbsp; We enjoy their style and company and like the energy we receive.&nbsp;   I had a tough time answering your question because immediately I wanted to respond, “definitely a dog!”&nbsp; A dog because I love them, I love their high energy and affectionate nature.&nbsp; I love their free-spiritedness and their “social butterfly” behavior.&nbsp; They require a lot of attention and physical interaction/exercise. They encourage me to be more active and loving simply because I have to take them for walks or runs and also cuddle and pet them a lot.&nbsp; Dogs are so smart. I love that they can be independent about some things like going outside (if they have a doggie door) and communicating to me when it’s time to eat.&nbsp; But, I also love that they still need me to take care of them.&nbsp; They still need me to nurture them….&nbsp;   The #1 thing I love about dogs is their innocence and ability to love unconditionally…  &nbsp; Now – a cat.&nbsp; Granted – I don’t know too much about them, but I see that cats are way more independent and much colder than dogs.&nbsp; The cat can love its owner, but doesn’t show it as much – they are not very affectionate by nature (cats in general – Java is definitely a rare case).&nbsp; They are very quiet and non-disruptive. Also, they are very elegant, careful and graceful creatures.&nbsp; Despite their low level of physical activity, they remain quite agile.  Considering this, I realize that I gravitate toward dogs because they have what I like and want.&nbsp; The way they are is how I wish I could be more like.&nbsp; I am attracted to dogs.&nbsp; However, my personality and actions are more like that of a cat.&nbsp;&nbsp;  I don’t see you as a cat – definitely a dog. You have that energy I like.&nbsp; You are more affectionate.&nbsp; You are free-spirited and have the “social-butterfly” behavior.&nbsp; You require more physical attention.&nbsp; You are so smart… You’re the dog I want to nurture….  &nbsp;And, the dog that I wish had my #1 favorite quality.
7.28.04    &nbsp;  “Jay,”  I wish I had that voice messaging service that allows me to send a voice mail without calling.&nbsp; I want to respond to your e-mails, but not in writing anymore.&nbsp; I want you to  hea r me say these things.&nbsp; I want you to sense the sincerity in my voice.&nbsp; I don’t want to call and have a conversation with you, not only because I don’t want to bother you, but also because I don’t want to be interrupted nor have it turn into an argument.  There are things I want to clarify.&nbsp; Starting with when it was that I did “cheat” – I wasn’t very clear in my “Dear ‘Jay’” entry.&nbsp; It wasn’t while you were in DC/NY.&nbsp; What I did do while you were there was solicit company to go out, but I was very clear to him that I did not want to get physical – because I was with someone.&nbsp; You and I have had a lot of on-and-off periods in our relationship and I “cheated” while we were off.&nbsp; However, I don’t consider that cheating.&nbsp; I thought we were over.  Another thing I want to clarify is why I don’t say that I want a “husband.”&nbsp; You should know by now that I am pretty politically correct&nbsp; - at least I try to be.&nbsp; When I speak, I like to use terms that are open for variation/interpretation - I don’t like to get into specifics.&nbsp; Plus, saying “one day, when I get married…” or “in the future, my husband…” is so cliché!&nbsp; They imply that you are living your life by society’s standards…ugh! This excerpt from my last fast-write will give you a better idea of what I mean:   Do you know why I am afraid to use the term “husband?”&nbsp; It’s because, to some men there is a certain sense of “baggage” attached to this concept.&nbsp; I choose to use the term “life partner” because it’s a general term, under which “husband” falls.&nbsp; I have noticed that many couples – the men, especially have problems making the transition from “boyfriend” to “husband” regardless of how long they have been with their significant other, and even if they have already been living like a married couple.&nbsp; There is something implied in this term that can make men flip-out and become scared that they are trapped with no way out.&nbsp; Because I am sensitive to this idea, and I still want a life partner, or husband, I opt not to scare away the man that I want to be with by potentially putting a negative idea in his head.&nbsp;   &nbsp; So… That answers one of the questions in your e-mail.&nbsp; Well, technically it wasn’t a question, but something you stated that I f
