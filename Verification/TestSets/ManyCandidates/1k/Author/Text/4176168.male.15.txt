I'm melting!!!...  Not really...but I feel like hell...staying up till 2 AM in the morning and waking up at 8 the next morning is not a good idea, I've been feeling tired the whole day, the only way keeping me sane...is probabely coke and work...very tired indeed.  Got a call from my traveling parents, and from what I can tell, they have been doing way to much driving and way too little sleep. It looks like it takes about 10 ours to drive to Quebec from Toronto, and when they finaly got there, they had trouble finding a place to stay...very troublesome, and the hotels there is very expensive...$120 a night...  Err...as I said in my last post, I finished the handbook last night and sent out the version 3, well..today I again got e-mail replays. But only 1 with a very minor change, so I guess that made my happy enough...so all I need to do is the add the cover and schedual and I am done. But printing present a problem once more, because I do not know how to print it in a book fashin...err...and they want to see hard copys tomorow...got to get this problem figured out...and make sure I don't screw up...  The stress and the deadline have been deadly...after I present this thing tomorow...I'm taking a couple of days off with this and going to enjoy my self and camp that's coming up in a week...and actually take a break during my vacation...  Anyways...going to go back and finish the handbook and print it correctly (hopefully) and get to bed before 1 in the morning...

What a long day it hav been...  Up until tonight...it was a good day. Remeber the draft that I finally sent out?...today I got about 10 e-mails back saying that there is something wrong with it that should be changed...which I could have done easily until I relized the massive changes that these people have made. Which have brought me here...2 o'clock in the morning writing this post with my last bit of energy...the whole change took me about 4 hours to do, so I have been working from 10 last night till today 2 in the morning...I am tired...but at least it's done. Who knows? Maybe tomorow when I wake up I'll face another 10 e-mails...oh well...this is the part I choose to do and I'm going to stick with it, and all in all, I am the best....or so I think ;)  Well...the life without parents is...so far very nice, I have been serviving and been having some fun, so I guess I am kind of enjoying this.  I never get a break, after all these hard work, I can only sleep for a couple of hours because I am giving a piano lesson 9:30 in the morning...I don't usually do these things this early, but oh well...and in the afternoon, I have worship practice for tomorow and a full day of meeting with the people to discuss the handbook and getting it ready to print...-_-...I am soooo tired...  Anyways...even the coke and coffe is not working on me anymore, so I guess I netter go to bed before I break down...so  Later Days  "I am soooo tired" - Me  Neo
AHHHHHHHH!!!! HOME ALONE!!!!  Alright.....:D  So my parents are getting ready to leave for the trip around Canada...they'll be gone for 5 days, so tomor when I wake up...I'll be waking up to a empty house for 5 days...HOUSE PARTY!!!...nah.  err...the hand book issue was finally solved after some thinking and everyone seems to be happy...just hope it gets approved in time so I can print it...time is always against me...-_-  Remeber how I said in my post yester day that I can't take another server break down for the medias on the site?...well...it broke down...but this time for other reasons than computer bugs. It looks like our bandwith is being used a lot lately...and the 10GB bandwith was shot within 15 days. So now I can't log on to the server or do anything. We're on lock down for the rest of the month...-_-...oh well   Later Days...  "Why, Why do you keep going?" "Because I choose to"  Neo...
No matter how much they can do, always...always there will be a downside to them...  Last night I finally got my Handbook sent out...this morning to my complet surprise, the 5 people that I send it to...4 of them bounced back...-_-... and for the rest of the day, these guys have been on my ass asking for the draft when their the one who couldn't find the space the recieve it...when times like this, I wished that everyone used Gmail...:D  Naruto Spot will be once again up tomorow, I had the honor of again looking over the site and find bugs and so on...it was a good night of work and we got everything fixed up and looking like new. All I need to do it to upload the current Naruto Shows and we should be ready to go tomorow. Hope the server doesn't break on my again. I can't take another server break-down...  Seems that my parents will be leaving for a quick tour of Canada this weekend, they'll be going to a couple of places...but since I am all booked Friday and Sunday, I can't go with them >  Later Days...
