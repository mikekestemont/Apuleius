Chris Rock is not only funny, he has a really cool multi-media  urlLink Web site  that works on a browser that's  not  Internet Explorer. His  urlLink new HBO special  is lesson in FCC non-regulation of cable television. Thank God, or whatever diety or non-diety you'd like to thank.   urlLink E-mail me .
urlLink  Are you kidding me  ? If ClearChannel and its, er, allies are worried that maybe satellite radio would do a good job providing local content,  they should start offering better local content themselves . But then again, that might not be, umm, cost effective.   urlLink E-mail me .
Does the  urlLink August 6, 2001 PDB  say anything to you? Just this: some guy we know is probably planning an attack, is planning an attack.  The thing for me is that while the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks were probably preventable only by better airport security, we're spending billions of dollars and losing hundreds of lives in an effort that's detracting from the war on terrorism -- remember Afghanistan? Yeah, we're in Iraq now, where Osama bin Laden isn't.  And speaking of Iraq, I just wanted to mention that certainly, Saddam Hussein needed to be removed. I don't dispute that. But (a) that's not the reason we were given why we were going into Iraq -- remember the WMDs that weren't there? -- and (b) we removed Saddam Hussein nearly a year ago. Then, 5 months ago, we captured him, and put him in captivity so that he could just sit there and not tell us about the WMDs that may or may not be there. I just don't think it's good that our elected leaders are lying to us. We pay their salaries, we deserve a bit of respect.   urlLink E-mail me .
Bush and Kerry  urlLink will have spent $90 million on TV ads  by the end of the coming week. Where are these ads? With my recent addiction to the History Channel, I've seen them there, but not during The Simpsons, Friends, baseball games, arena football games, Stanley Cup playoff games or my local morning news. I thought young people were supposed to be an important demographic.   urlLink E-mail me .
urlLink Yeehaw .

Can  urlLink Chris Rock save America ? Maybe. Can  urlLink John Kerry please start talking about other issues  before nobody knows where he stands on anything but the war? Let's hope so. Can  urlLink the Sox beat the Yankees  again? Probably. Happy Saturday. Oh yeah. Check out  urlLink Tony's page  -- it's almost done, and certainly complete enough to look at.   urlLink E-mail me .
I received an e-mail last week that reads: "No joke: If the Palestinians put down their weapons, there would be no war. If the Israelis put down their weapons, there would be no Israel." What the people who have circulated that e-mail are missing is the fact that Palestinians first picked up their weapons because they were removed from their homes and jobs, and now even law-abiding Palestinians aren't allowed to go into Israel to try to earn enough to buy food for their families, never mind health care, clothing and good homes. If there were a truce, would that change? No way. If we want there to be a cease-fire on both sides, Israel is going to have to do some pretty hefty giving to the Palestinians.   urlLink E-mail me .
Bob Woodward  urlLink has a new book out  about the war in Iraq. 74 of the 75 sources he spoke to spoke off the record (President Bush was the only one who went on the record). The problem with that? Woodward might have a history of falsifying sources. Mind you, he  might  have this history -- books have been written abou "Deepthroat," who probably is more than one source, and since his groundbreaking work on the Watergate scandal, Woodward his pretty much been allowed to use anonymous sources at his will. Maybe they'll ask him some real questions on Sunday on 60 Minutes. Maybe not -- Viacom owns both Woodward's book and 60 Minutes.   urlLink E-mail me .

After the Celtics got off to a pretty slow start,  urlLink Zach  told a very skeptical me that it could be the Celts' year anyway. Well, after  urlLink beating the Hawks 137-132  in a game that  didn't  go into OT, the Celtics finished the season 10 games under .500 -- and still made the playoffs. I'm still skeptical, but Zach could still be right.   urlLink E-mail me .  Go  urlLink home .

Today's a day. Lots of stuff happening. Multicultural Broadcasting Network  urlLink booted Air America Radio  after that bastion of liberalism had been on its stations in Chicago and Los Angeles for a whole 2 weeks. It appears AAR has bounced a check -- for $1 million.  urlLink AAR disagrees , of course, and has  urlLink filed a complaint  in the dispute.  In brighter news, the  urlLink Westsides's Taste on the Common's Web site  is finally up.  And in even better news,  urlLink Andrea's  doing much better!!!!!   urlLink E-mail me .  Go  urlLink home .

Why I find it hard to call myself a Democrat: Democrats do stuff like  urlLink this . We can think things all we want, but cripes, we don't mean it. Perhaps that's the one reason I needed to switch my affiliation back to unenrolled. Here's a couple of articles about the ad:  urlLink TBO  and  urlLink Washington Times .   urlLink E-mail me .

So, it seems Bush (1) isn't worried about keeping his job (see his response to "Judy"), and (2) can't answer sensitive questions without knowing they're coming (see his response to "
