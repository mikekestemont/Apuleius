I went home for lunch just now. Well.. even a short nap can make me dream..hahaha Anyway, I don't quite remember what the dream was about. But I'm very sure that I dream about something. What I remembered was, I heard my mom keep calling my name many times. I don't remember why she called.
Let me start this blog with my dream last night. Usually I tend to dream about something that is connected to what I did or think before going to bed. Well.. last night I watch '50 First Dates'[Drew Barrymore & Adam Sandler]. Don't get me wrong. I didn't dream about them. But this is what I dream of:-  I dreamt that my collegue, Azhar give me a phone call at 11am asking weather I'll be coming to work or not since I was already 2 hours late. I was still in bed at that time. I told him that I had a short term memory lost and I don't remember where is my office and what time should I be going to the office.  The moral of the story.. don't watch any movie before heading to the bed..Hahahaha
I've created a new blog. This blog will include my everyday dream...hehehe. I've realize that somehow.. I have dreams every night or everytime I sleep. So, i think I should keep it as a journal just for me to keep track on my dreams and remembering it..hehehe. Who knows.. there might be something worth about it. Anyway.. I like analyzing my own dreams..hehehe :P
Sometimes, even without the snooze button I manage to get few dreams in a row. This are my dream last night. It was just some short scene..Hahaha I'm not quite sure the actual order.   Scene 1: Yesterday, I log in into my ntv7 forum as usual and I read about this two people were planning to meet up at YowChuan for Karaoke. In my dream, I actually was there, at YowChuan and saw both of them were sitting on a table drinking together. I did'nt talk to them and introduce myself though!  Scene 2: I dream that I was at McDonalds having lunch or dinner wth my lil brother(Azhad) and my uncle(pakcik). This mcDonals is different. It wasn't self-service, they serve us at our table. I was about to give my order but my uncle ask me first weather will he be kenyang just by taking chicken. How big is the chicken? I instead said that he'll definitely kenyang because the chicken is big. It's quater of one whole chicken. I wonder since when McD serve those kind of big chicken..hahaha  Scene 3: Yesterday I ran into my old schoolmate(Haidi). We said 'hi'! He also said we should have lunch together sometimes. So, I said Insyallah. Anyway.. somehow.. he came into my next dream. In my dream, it was already the day after. I was going to have my lunch downstairs at the restaurant. I saw him as if waiting for me to have lunch together. But instead of me siiting with him, I sat next to somebody else. I don't remember who he was. But I definitely knew him from somewhere. Haidi instead, just sit there alone.  Scene 4: This is a very short dream. I was talking to nonie. I think it was on the phone because I don't somehow saw her face. She was asking me about her b'day. How about celebrating it at her new home. I don't agree since I'm not allowed to go out at night time. Instead I suggest to crash the party in my house, in my room. She finally agreed...Hahaha  Scene 5: I dream that I was at the office and my collegue told me to help him up to photocopy some documents.   Don't Believe everything that appear in your dream..
I've just remembered anoter one of my dream last night.  I dreamt that I was in my formner high school. I was on y was to the old surau to pray. I don't know what fardhu was it. Anyway, I was walking towards the surau, wearing 'terompah' and only kain batik. Nobody seems to feel it was awkward. As I entered the surau, I saw that there was no curtain to seperate the men section and ladies. But everyone was praying with no problem. So, i go on wearing my telekung and pray. After finishing praying I saw 2 men that seems familiar was praying in front of me. It was 2 of my friend that i met in Mecca when I went there few months ago. One of it is Ustaz Zul. He turn to me and smile..hahaha  What is he doing in my dream?? How come I've never dream my boyfrend praying eh??
Last night, I'm very sure that I have 3 dreams in a row. However I only manage to remember 1 of it.  In my dream, I was taking a ride on a car with my mom's friend (Unty Julia). We were like going somewhere where we'll be passing by a toll booth. In her hands was lots of coins. Enough for the toll amount. But she insist to the coins for bigger change. So she dive me home only for me to change the whole coins into dollars from my mother.  The funny thing about this dream was, I hardly knew Unty Julia. Inact I've never had any kind of ride on her car. And I didn't even remember when was the last time I even talk to her. I wonder how did she manage to enter my dream???? hahaha..
I have an alarm clock with a snooze button. I love to press it every morning. I once use the snooze button form 7am to 9am.. Hahaha Each time I snap the snooze button I'll get a different dream slot! Last night.. from what I remembered I had so many dream slot. But I don't remember all of it.  Slot 1: I dreamt I was in my office alone. Then my boss was at the door. I opened the door only to find out t
