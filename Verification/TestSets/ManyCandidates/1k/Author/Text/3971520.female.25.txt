Ok, read my comments section if you don't know what getting 'krunk' means. Thanks for making me feel a little less stupid, by the way. Today was hard. We were all a little cranky and it was hard to stay positive with a group of girls who are a little less than Olympic talent. We forget that they have one-track minds and that they are all about boys. That is all that is on their minds. I got to go "Coach Langford" on them today, though. I was boiling and then a girl threw a ball to get it to the ball bin and hit me with it, instead. They all know that they are to walk the balls to the ball bin to avoid such an event. I slammed a ball down on the floor and screamed and made them do push-ups. They didn't try to throw the balls in the bin anymore after that. I forgot that I had such a temper. Nah, just kidding. I knew. You can all imagine the whole scene. LoLo with a red face and hollaring, trying not to let the voice get too shaky. Yeah. That's how it went. Anyway, I wasn't so 'krunk' today, but they still love me. It wouldn't have been such a big deal if I hadn't gotten clocked by the best hitter in the seventh grade that very morning. I mean, she hit that ball so hard that when it hit me in the jaw, it jerked my head over like in the movies when someone gets hit. I turned around to regain my focus and all of the coaches said that I had that glazed look. You know. The sleep-walking one. I couldn't hardly see or stand up, either. The girl felt really bad, but I wasn't mad. I couldn't even talk right. What was I going to say to her? If I said anything, it would have been that drunk, slurred voice that I get when I am not all there, anyway. It took about 10 minute to regain my senses, but I did it. What a day it has been for the coach today.
So, just in case you didn't already know, I am so sore!!!!! I am hurting so bad and I think I hurt myself worse today. WE learned barrell rolls today ans just let me tell ya', they are not for older gals such as myself. I was so eager to get out there and demonstrate them and didn't realize that all of the other coaches just stood back and watched. Stupid me.   I did learn some new things today. I learned how to 'get krunk' by learning the chicken head dance. Maybe some of you already know this, but I didn't. I think it is a culture thing and there is a reason that white people don't know this dance. It is because we have no rhythm and just cannot do it without looking stupid. Yes, I got laughed at today...a lot. That's ok. I can handle it. At least they know that I am eager to learn new things.   I just got home from taking the written portion of my CDL bus driver's license. There are five sections and I failed ALL of them!!!!! What is up with that? Maybe I should study before I go back to take it tomorrow. I am feeling pretty down about not being 'krunk' and not passing my test. Any loving words to make me feel better? How about a story of feeling stupid today?
So, I have been at volleyball camp since yesterday, here in Everman and it is kickin' my tail. I hurt in places that I forgot I could hurt in. LOL!!!! Demonstrations are killers. Anyway, I am having a great time. I am having to broaden my horizons and learn names like 'Obshanique' and 'Jaquesia', but other than that, the girls and I are getting along pretty well. I am sooooo tired, but I got a two hour nap this afternoon. Anyway, thought I would keep you posted. I am not missing home as of yet, but I think it is in the near future. I love you all. Talk to you soon.
Ok, so I have to say that I am totally excited today. I have been out of pocket, so I am sorry for not updating my blog. I have been with my youth group in Arlington going to Rangers game and Six Flags. By the way, the Rangers are now tied for first place with the Anahiem Angels. Yes, they did win the game that I went to, Kell, but they lost the second game with them and now are tied for first. Anahiem was in second before the two game series. Exciting stuff. My team hasn't been this good in quite a while. Well, since 1999. Anyway, I have not had computer access. Sorry. By the way...Michelle, this is Lorna Langford. You know, that cool chick that used to come to OBU all the time. Yeah, I am the hottie from H-town. LOL!!!!!!   So, here is the reason that I am in such a good mood...I passed the high school english certification exam. I am now a high school english teacher, too. Who would have ever thought that I would be an english teacher? I don't know. I just got the news about 5 minutes ago and I am totally pumped. God is doing great things for me. My life just keeps getting better. I love this!!!! I am becoming me. Wow!!!! Anyway, I have some celebrating to do. Will post again soon.
You know...I am so excited about this thing. It is so neat. I just couldn't wait until tomorrow to write another one. I miss all of my friends so much. My life is taking such a turn and all I can think of is you guys. How did you guys do this and not just be scared out of your mind? I am so nervous. I am afraid that I am going to get to Ft. W
