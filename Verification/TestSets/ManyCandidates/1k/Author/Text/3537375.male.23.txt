It was going to be a boring, depressing (See below) rather sleep deprived Friday until I read that story.  In other news, my Handspring Treo 270 crapped out....again.  On to the third device, the second one lasted barely 3 months. My phone tripped into a spectacular death this morning with a plethora of software and hardware failures: 1. call waiting ceased to work 2. battery refused to hold a charge 3. handsfree crapped out 4. voice quality had deteriorated significantly (from the less than stellar quality it had when it was new) 5. dropped calls galore and bad RF performance.  I must admit I had low expectations for Handspring's build quality as their reputation on web boards was less than stellar.  But this Treo device has exceeded my wildest dreams, more accurately my wildest nightmares.    I give the new (who am I kidding?).....  refurbished device 2 months max before it kicks the bucket.  I thought paying $50 for the device was a bargain, in reality it seems that I have merely broke even as the device has much to be desired in reliability.  Of course, I may be too harsh on Handspring, this was a first generation convergence device and I shouldn't expect much.  What I did expect was a device that retails for $400 to last longer than 3 months under normal use.  Shit, this phone couldn't out last a typical Jennifer Lopez marriage for that matter.  And from what I have heard about the Treo 600, the new $500 second generation convergence device from Handspring, Handspring has done little to improve their build quality.  One plus,  major props to T-Mobile for sending me a newly refurbished Treo 270 and providing a free loaner Nokia to tide me over while it gets here.
It seems that RIAA has once again cranked up the P2P law suit machine.  Given their recent defeat in the US COA, the Record Industry entity is now suing John Does by the hundreds.  Will this slow down P2P usage? Probably not.  An interesting exercise in futility that produces countless false suits against 80 year old grand mothers who don't use computers and 8 year olds.
Am I the only one who'd like to know what the first year rankings are?  They are only mildly important to our careers in the law; nonetheless, I think one month after grades posting the rankings should be updated.  I officially protest!
As the link will show, the number one selling album in the U.S. is the new Velvet Revolver CD: "Contraband".  I will not dispute the quality of the music on the CD as great names grace the production such as Stone Temple Pilots and Guns N' Roses; I do dispute the encumbrances that the record companies have thrown onto the CD.  For those not aware, this CD has a copy protection mechanism embedded in it.  For those light on the technology, I will keep things simple: "you cannot make mp3's from this CD".  That's right, you can only play in your CD player just like goodie-goodie consumer the record companies want us to be.  Have an IPOD, guess what, you are SOL.  What's that you say, you want to play the music you bought on another device such as a rare thingamajig called a mp3 player  ( scoffs )?  Well, according to the record industry, you better get a Itunes account and pay for another copy cause you are also SOL.  What's that, what if you dare encode your music in another format such as  urlLink ogg vorbis , like myself ( scoffs twice )?  Well you are totally f*cked cause the intent of this copy protection scheme is to halt that type of use.      You might ask what can the 4 people who read Jack's BLOG do about this?  Very simply, do not buy copy protected CD's such as the current Velvet Revolver CD.  Buying these CD's is an endorsement of the death of fair use of the music we buy.  If there is appropriate consumer backlash, the record companies will cease its use.  If the current trend of rampant consumer acceptance of such technologies continues, copy protection will become the norm and consumers will have to buy one 20 dollar CD for the car, one 20 dollar super audio CD for the home, another 9 dollars for buying the 2-3 three actual decent tracks from a digital music vendor so we can play the music on our PC's and mp3 players.  People, this is the ideal market model for the record companies, if we do not speak up with our wallets now, they will be significantly lighter in the future.
urlLink  Supreme Court Ruling   The Court nicely upheld the pledge without actually upholding the pledge, Niiiice.  I think Rehnquist, O'Connor and Thomas chimed in on the constitutionality issue of the pledge.  Good for you guys, way to actually make a stand in dicta.  I always enjoy how the Court resolves issues by not actually resolving them.  And, I thought I was the only one who procrastinated doing my tasks.
It has been a scorcher of a week, it has been hot and humid.  As an engineer, I work best in a cool low humidity environment; consequently, I have not been at my best this week.  Nonetheless, I have mushed onward despite the crappy Gainesville weather.  I broke down this  week and saw Harry Potter, I give it ***.  It was entertaining enough to keep my attention.     Still pales in comparison to LOTR.
NOTHING, on the front page, not even a blurb.  not even a 4 font by line.  Hmmm,  interesting provocative.
President George W. Bush:  This is a sad hour in the life of America. A great American life has come to an end. I have just spoken to Nancy Reagan. On behalf of our whole nation, Laura and I offered her and the Reagan family our prayers and our condolences.  Ronald Reagan won America's respect with his greatness, and won its love with his goodness. He had the confidence that comes with conviction, the strength that comes with character, the grace that c
