Isso dizia numa carta escrita em 1991 a uma amiga. Eu tinha 14 anos, da para acreditar! Entao, mudei de vida ou nao? Sim, e muito! 1991 - 14 anos, estudante, residindo em Natal/RN/Brasil. 2004 - 27 anos, secretaria numa firma de advocacia, residindo em New York a 3 anos, longe da familia, longe dos antigos amigos, mas muitos amigos novos, um novo lar. Nesses 13 anos muita coisa mudou alem do meu endereco. Na cartinha de amigas q moravam em cidades diferentes eu dizia que queria 'mudar, mudar, mudar'. Ainda tenho esse mesmo desejo de mudar, essa sede de explorar lugares ainda desconhecidos por mim, ver as coisas de minha propria otica. 'Paris e linda!!!', 'London e fria e cinzenta.' Eu quero dizer o que eu acho, nao repetir o ponto de vista de outros. Provavelmente vou constatar o mesmo. Mas quero contar sobre um dia chuvoso em Paris e sobre um ensolarado dia de verao em London quando estava la. E bom saber q nem tudo muda - e que uma pessoa que me correspondo a mais de 13 anos me fez perceber isso numa conversa hoje.
Jehovah told a certain man He had work for him to do. This certain man had a large rock in front of his house and Jehovah explained that the man was to push against the rock with all his might. This the man did, day after day.  For many years he toiled from sun rise to sun set, his shoulders set squarely against the cold, massive surface of the unmoving rock, pushing with all his might. Each night the man returned home sore, worn out and feeling that his whole day had been spent in vain. Seeing that the man was showing signs of discouragement, Satan decided to enter the picture by placing thoughts into the man's weary mind: "You have been pushing against  that rock for a long time, and it hasn't budged. Why kill yourself over this? You are never going to move it." This gave the man the impression that the task was impossible and that he was a failure, these thoughts discouraged and disheartened the man. "Why kill myself over this?" he thought. "I'll just put in my time, give the minimum effort and that will be good enough." And that is what he planned to do until he decided to make it a matter of prayer and take his troubled thoughts to Jehovah. "Jehovah, I have labored long and hard in your service, putting all my strength to do what you have asked of me. Yet, after all this time I have not even budged that rock by half a millimeter. What is wrong? Why am I failing?" Then Jehovah responded compassionately, "When I asked you to serve and you accepted, I told you that your task was to push against the rock with all your strength, which you have done. Never once did I mention to you that I expected you to move it. Your task was to push. And now you come to me, with your strength spent, thinking that you have failed. But is that really so? ...Look at yourself. Your arms are strong and muscled, your back is sinew and brown, your hands are callused from constant pressure, and your legs have become massive and hard. Through opposition you have grown much and your abilities now surpass that which you used to have... Yes, you haven't moved the rock but then all I ever asked was that you be obedient and push. It was through your works that you exercised faith in me. This you have done, and now I will move the rock for you."  At times, when we may tend to think little of ourselves and our service to Jehovah and we become disheartened and discouraged, we need to remember what Jehovah asks of us and that is just simply obedience and faith in Him.....  By all means, exercise faith that moves mountains but know that it is still Jehovah who does the moving. When everything seems to go wrong, just Push.  When your job gets you down, just Push. When people don't treat you kindly, just push. When people don't react the way you think they should, just Push.  When people reject you in the ministry just Push.   PUSH = Pray Until Something Happens.
This illustration was given at a circuit assembly:  There was a farmer who raised sheep and had trouble with wolves stealing his sheep. He loved his sheep and didn't want to lose even one of them. One day the wolves came and the farmer quickly raised his rifle and POW! - killed every wolf he shot at. As he turned his rifle toward a shadow he saw a puppy wolf huddling beside a fence post shivering. The farmer felt sorry for him, picked him up, tucked him inside his coat and took him home.  As time passed, the farmer grew to love the puppy wolf and took him everyday to help him tend his sheep. The sheep loved the puppy wolf too and thought of him as one of one of them.  The puppy wolf learned to call the sheep by their names, just like the farmer did. It wasn't long before he grew to full size and the farmer trusted him t o care for his sheep while he rode to town to buy supplies.  Then one day the puppy wolf was running in the farmer's field and heard howling in the woods. He ran to the edge of the fence and watched as a pack of wolves approached. They seemed happy to see him although he didn't recognize them. One by one they told him of all the fun they were having, running anywhere they wanted, doing whatever they pleased...no one telling them what to do!  They invited him to come on the other side of the fence with them. The puppy wolf thought about the fence, and how he'd never been on the other side of it. The more he listened he began to w
