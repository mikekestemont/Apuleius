Testing has taken its toll on the students. Fortunately we are a little more progressive than most public schools. We were able to reward our students by taking them to a river where we rock hop and swim. The weather has been opressive today, around 95 degrees. Yesterday was a record high for the month of April. Fortunately the kids don't moan about the weather much. I like it.   On the hike down to the water hole on the river one of the students was very scared and concerned about every little thing. It took her around twenty minutes to get down, whereas others took ten minutes. Heck, by the time she got down it was time for us to leave, almost... Anyway, on the way back up, she started to complain and cry about wanting water, and then she refused to move, sitting there on the trail in the full sun light. Thirteen years old and using techniques which are more suite to a six year old. This one is definitely placed appropriately at our school.   Down at the river there was a local girl, looked about 15. She had her dog and a can of beer. Since she is what I call a random, I had to be careful to monitor the interactions between her and our students. Some of our students swarmed around her. She was cool.... not. But she was in a bikini top, which instantly attracted attention from some of our pubic boys. Listening to her was very interesting, as she turned out to be pretty intelligent. She was telling the students all sorts of stuff about the water, and the creatures in it. etc..    Our students get angry or frustrated at school and they say fuck this place it sucks, worst school ever, shit, hell, blah blah blah. Truth is, its the best place a lot of them have been. Anyway, the girl at the river tells me that she thinks our school is awsome for taking the kids to the river. " my school never took us" to the water, she says. Most of the kids heard that, which is far more powerful for them to hear from a "peer."    So, what I thought to possibly turn out to be a tough situation, turned out fine.  More testing tomorrow. Actually, for most of the students it has turned into a creative bubble filling exercise.  Peace, Dave
testing today !   SAT 9   It is beyond me how the state can mandate testing for this population. They tend to have difficulty in stressful situations. Three hours of testing each day for six to seven days would cause "normal" folks lots of stress. Heck, most of the students at our school don't even have a chance to graduate. The only way the students can get out of it is to have their parents sign a waiver. The catch is, the districts are encouraged to not present exemption as an option. So, most schools say nothing about that possibility, and the parents have no idea.   The irony at my school is that one of the smartest students at our school, which is above normal I.Q in all academic areas, is exempt from the test. His mom has connections. Some of the most fragile, low self-esteemed children are having to take it, even though we know they will fail either by quiting, or taking it. Tlak about screwed up.   Second session of testing is starting...gotta go  Peace, Dave

Hey there all,   This is the first post for my therapeutic outlet. Welcome!    My name is NorCalDave. I have worked with children for many years. Those I have worked with have been abused emotionally, sexually, physically, and spiritually. I have worked with kids from 2 years of age to 18 years of age. When I first started to work with the younger kids, it was difficult for me emotionally. The types of abuse, ignorance, power play, sickness, and  agendas adults put on kids is one of the hardest things to take in this life.    Anyway, I now get to see, and attempt to help correct, the manifestations of the treatment these kids have endured. No, I mean survived. All of the students I currently work with are survivors. And somtimes I can't help but feel that we are only holding these kids in a survival pattern until the system has no place for them, except jail, the streets, or dead.    Some of the kids at the school are very intelligent, probably more so than their parents in some cases. That smarts is a double edged sword for them. The brains can pull them out of the cycle they're in, or it can facilitate their spiral further away from social functionality.    More background and spout later.....story.  One time, when I was working in a group home, a resident became very upset about not getting what he wanted. To the casual observer it wouldn't have seemed like a tragic moment, but it was f
