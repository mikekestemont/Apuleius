I hate people who use chopsticks to eat Chinese food. They are the lowest form of human on earth. And don’t give that “when in Rome” bullshit. You don’t dress up like a long shore man when I go to Red Lobster. Using chopsticks to eat Chinese food is like drinking unpasturised milk, archaic and stupid. “But Shurs, some people get a sense of accomplishment from mastering chopsticks.” Then buy a fucking puzzle, the one with the big pieces, because completing that is as much of an accomplishment as “mastering” chopsticks.
Is there anything uglier than seeing a girl wearing a baseball cap? They even make a goddess like Britney Spears look like a the trailer trash she would be if she didn’t have a mom who was ready from the earliest age to exploit her. Baseball caps are for baseball players, black men, cancer patients and people at sporting events. That’s it, that’s the complete list of times they are cool. Caps are like Hot Girl Camouflage. Once the cap is on a beautiful girl blends in with the ugliness of humanity. Stars wear them so they won’t get recognized in public. I’ve asked girls why they wear hats and the answer is almost always; “I looked like crap so I threw this on.” Well I hate to break it to you but now you look worse. Put some work into your look, as a female that is all you have.
The Massachusetts Supreme Court legalized gay marriage, causing outrage in conservative pockets around the country. What do I think of gay marriage? I don’t care. In my opinion there are a lot more palatable issues to be concerned with over a slip of paper given to gay couples.   President Bush issued a statement saying: “The sacred institution of marriage should not be redefined by a few activist judges.” So in the President’s opinion, marriage is too important for Supreme Court Judges to making a ruling on but the office of President isn’t? Ron Crews, former president of the Massachusetts Family Institute said that the ruling “...says marriage has been redefined and devalued.” Poor guy, it must be hard to go home and look your wife (if you can still call her that) in the  face knowing that gay guys and gals share a title that you two do. And I have no doubt that Evangelicals will be going even more crazy then usual, predicting that this is the last straw that means the end of the world will happen very soon. But you know what? People have always thought the end of the world was just around the corner. It’s a good way to scare people into living the life you want them to live.  My advice to everyone is to mind their own business. The same conservative Christians who complain that it’s nobody’s business if their kids pray in school (and IMO it’s not, unless they make a spectacle out of it) are the ones who are butting their hypocritical noses into this issue. Yes, the Bible says that being gay is bad, but it also condemns many things that “Born Again” Christians do as well. They just choose to ignore them, or skew their meanings essentially wrapping their faith around their lives as opposed to wrapping their lives around their faith. I’ll get to that stuff another time though.  I encourage all gay couples to go to Massachusetts, get married and stay there. We should give the state to them like we gave Israel to the Jews. Think about it, this would allow them a place they could be safe and live their lives the way they want to. And with no straight men left in the state we wouldn’t have to hear their constant whining about the curse of the Bambino. Everybody wins.
1-For making your ex- husband go to rehab for sex addiction. Is it possible to rehabilitate being a frigid cunt?  2-For your Oscar acceptance speech in which you talked about what it is to be a black woman even though your mom is white and your dad didn’t raise you.  3-For making out with Fred Durst in a music video.  4-For acting like you want to advance the craft of acting, then making super hero movies.  5-For calling the cops when you found me masturbating while sniffing your shampoo.
I read an article in the newspaper today about how because LaToya London got voted out of American Idol on Wednesday night that it must be due to racism. Surely someone as talented as London should have been in the final two over less polished singers like Jasmine Trias or Diana DeGarmo, the article stated. So is this were racism is in the 20th century? Do Klansmen sit around watching Fox on Tuesday nights in their hoods waiting for the two hour voting window just to stick it to the black race? I don't think so. I think it goes deeper than that. I think America hates black women.  But it's not just white America that hates black women. Even black men don't like them. Look around. How often do you see black men with black women? Almost never. Black men, rich and poor alike love white women. Either as a trophy of their success or as someone to pay their bills for them. Can you name one black woman who is universally loved across all races? Well let's take a look.  Beyonce Knowles- Her momma is white.  Halle Berry- White mom.  Whitney Houston- It worked for a while until the "real" her came out.  Oprah- Well if housewives count for all of America...  Conservatives rail rappers for degrading women by calling them bitches in their songs but if I grew up in a neighborhood full of black women that would be the only way to explain them. Black women have horrible attitudes, they hate everyone. They hate white women for stealing their men, they hate white men because they keep the brothas down, they hate Latinos because they can dance just as well as they can, t
