Ok, Kerry has truly lost touch, lets see this is what he wants to do. In a speech he gave today, he stated, if he was elected president and Usama was captured by US forces alive, he would make sure he got a fast and speedy trial here in the United States, where he would see that he was tried for the murders in NYC, Penn, and Washington DC. Wait a minute, I can here Johnny Cochran just beginning to count his money he would get from all the Usama sympathizers, hell he would probably try it pro-bono just to get the book deal, and his face all over the big screens across the world. But here is the case as it would unfold, Johnny would prove with out a doubt Usama was not on the planes, US intelligence is classified therefore not able to be used in court and completely circumstantial, and finally Usama was really misunderstood and suffered years of oppression from the west, it was our fault he turned out to be a fanatic, he really meant no harm in his statements to his underlings.   God what a moron, so here is the deal, if Usama is found, shoot him dead, cut of his head and air it every Arabic TV station.  below is the link to the article, just so everyone knows I am not making it up, and it is not a black helicopter theory, its not a Fox News site, or any other site of a vast right wing conspiracy, it is simply the AP.  urlLink http://apnews.myway.com/article/20040730/D845AAV00.html
Ok, Kerry has taken every speech he has given to date and stuck them all together.&nbsp; It really is just a big anti-bush deal, I thought his goal was to appeal to the American people and tell us what he is going to do, how he is going to do it!&nbsp; Damn, I have heard more perspective arguments from my dad's neighbor's children, &nbsp;trying to get me to give them a can of pop.&nbsp;  When are they going to explain to us their plan for the war on terror, the economy, etc, I have heard nothing from these people, absolutely nothing!&nbsp; So here is what you get, JFK will do this smarter, he will make things better because he was in Vietnam, and the French will support him.&nbsp; Sigh, so here is the new slogan.&nbsp; KERRY 04, because he is not BUSH.   If I really cared I would actually line by line his crappy speech, but there is no substance here.&nbsp;   &nbsp;
So guess what, sometime last night, after watching the DNC I am sure, so low life varmint decide that our hammock we had outside was being neglected and decided to borrow it without returning it.&nbsp; Got to love AMERICA, since we are "rich" ie rich being defined as having something that other people don't have since the George Bush was unable to provide it, (note during the Clinton years theft most not have occurred because a democrat was in office.&nbsp; HOLD THE PHONE, this is a real time discovery, Emily (my girlfriend for those who don't know), went outside around behind our garage and discovered the varmint was unable to carry it over the fence that was bent over and left it there to rest, so it looks like we are going to have to throw some razor wire back there to deal with the problem.&nbsp; Damn, maybe not, because if I do that, and an unexpecting criminal happens to cut himself (or herself, gotta be PC, not gender biased), then its my fault and I will get sued by a lawyer much like the kind of lawyer John Edwards.&nbsp; So whats the next step, cops in my neighborhood will not patrol (station says they need to get more tickets written for speeding, catching thieves and deterring crime only costs the station house money ).&nbsp; What next, maybe I should sit in my back yard with a large assault rifle and just "defend my property", at any rate cops are useless since they don't patrol, everyone knows there is not a police presence anywhere, so what better thing to do.&nbsp; Note this is not an isolated incident, before I moved in, and we were living out of my apartment, we had some nice kind soul, kick down our door, just a few weeks ago another nice individual borrowed my gas grill (with out returning it).&nbsp; So what to DO!   &nbsp;
Ok, I got sick and tired of sending out email spam of random political rants.&nbsp; So, I took my friends advice and started my own blog.&nbsp; Not that I am expecting to many people to actually waste their time and effort on reading this thing, but hey I might as well put it up for my own sanity.&nbsp; So sit back, reply, enjoy, hate it, praise, ignore it, I personally don't care, but at least I have a place to vent.&nbsp;   here is a quick link to a Ray's blog, enjoy his law school rants:&nbsp;   urlLink http://www.raymond42.blogspot.com/   &nbsp;
YAAAAAAWWWNNNNNNN  is about all I can really say when thinking about it.&nbsp; Hell, even Dan Rather thinks this is so boring. So what happened to the conventions?&nbsp; Once upon a time, the conventions was a place where all the delegates of each state would sort through pressing issues of the time and nominate the person they see fit, now what is it, a freaking joke!&nbsp; All they do is put on there pretty hats, censor all the speeches to be more "moderate" and less anti-Bush.&nbsp; The entire world has known for months that Kerry is the democrats guy, why waste all the money, why shut down an entire city for absolutely nothing, and don't get me wrong this all will directly apply to the RNC as well.&nbsp; The legitimacy is long gone of these things, I am not sure why they even cover it, hell on Monday, with all the heavy hitters, both Clintons, Al Gore etc speaking, nobody watched and it was on every channel, expect for one, where a l
