one of my favorite things to do: listen to jake play his songs. they are just fun. especially when he's drunk. he keeps missing strings. its beautiful.  i just went and saw troy. i loved it. but i must admit my favorite part is when orlando bloom's character goes from paris, prince of troy, to legolas...THE MOST AWESOME ELF EVER! i guess you have to look closely, but its there. he's all like ooh.. im the pussy of the movie...everyone else gets to be badasses... then WHAM!!!! he whips out his bow and arrow and goes all legolas style. i was waiting for him to like slide down some stairs on a shield shooting all the greeks with arrows but it never happened. orlando bloom, you're blackened locks of curls don't fool me... i know you'll always be an elf.   so its monday night and i only have aprrox. 6 hours until i'm officially senior. i'm so excited. but f finals. i dont even think im gonna try. i just really dont even care anymore.   so here's the skinny. i've been drunk since thursday. not so much anymore, but i still have a decent buzz going on. we went to chili's today for some post-drinking grub and when we walked in there was like a tunnel of chili's employees surrounding us. i kid you not, i was waiting for them to like put their arms up and everything like the parents used to do at little soccer games. it kinda freaked me out though. especially when im thinking, shit the only reason they are doing this is cuz they know im fucked up. how do they know? those shady bastards...  and now here's the fatty... sam and catherine broke up. :( i don't know what to think. i dunno. im just confused. more on that later.  song right now: jake's little diddy- untitled: "angels rolled the dice, time was on our side. angels take me away, my happy day." hehe  bed time.
well, i am just giddy right now. for no reason really.. just giddy. i love the internet.it brings forth all sorts of surprises. like micheal ryan. i love michael ryan.  micheal ryan is crazy. the craziest kind of crazy, i'd like to add. one of his goals is to meet the king of the rats.... and he's completely serious. nonetheless, i love this person. his plan is for us to get married when i come back to california. what a nut. hehe... but i would tap that...5 times... in the snow. lol  when i become a mom i want to be like the mom in "the boondock saints." you won't see much of the mom unless you watch the deleted scenes. she has twins and never tells them which one came out first. this is hilarious to me. i want to play all sorts of tricks like that on my children. maybe i should blame drugs for that one.. but oh well. and she calls them up all drunk on st. patty's day and pretends she's gonna kill herself. i think i have a sick sense of humor but its hilarious. i guess you'd have to see it. and so then at the end of the conversation, they ask her the question: "after 27 years, could you please tell us!! which one of us came out first?" and after a long silence she decides to tell them. the mood is all serious and you are going to find out if murphy or connor is older... and she responds.. "The one with the bigger cock!! HAH!" what a great mom  i want school to be done. officially. i'm so tired of it. i just want it to die. shit i have sat's coming up again. oh well.   i think i'm going to call ethan tonight. i miss him dearly.  Lets add a recent ethan quote:   I miss you too.  There are times when i think about how much different my year would have been if you were around this year.  You would have stopped me from doing so many stupid things, and probably got me to do so many more stupid, but awesome things.  One thing i miss was that you were always kinda apart from the rest of my group of friends, and we never really had issues for extended periods of time, so like i could come hang out with you and ur fridge of goodies and ur movie collection and ur dog, and then we could go swimming, lay in your front yard, and then maybe help your mom write a witty passage about bears for her scrapbook.  mmmm.....I miss you.    I guess that really only makes sense to me... but i love it. ::sigh::  song right now: bronco tatonka: "bitten lip"  fare-the-well
i can never think of a clever or witty title that goes along with each entry, especially cuz there is not one title that can go along with  one   seeing as they are all so random. that's ok though. i prefer to choose random songs. like today. mmm avenged sevenfold. they played here not too long ago, alas.. i missed that one. tomorrow from autumn to ashes, 18 visions (i think) and atreyu are playing. sadly, i think i might miss that one too. oh well  lets see... only 5 more days and 4 finals left of school. i am beyond stoked for school to end. i need it to be summer. although next year is gonna blow cuz i'm taking a full schedule with three college classes. i think i'm going to kill myself. oh well... i guess it happens. not the killing myself.... the hard classes.. yah.  i'm also looking forward to this weekend :) hello empty house :)  ok, sam seriously needs to call me back. he's getting his license right now and i am supposed to hang out with him.  when he called they were on 41 and he is number 44. ok seriously, what is with the long lines at those places? i mean, its not that hard to work e
