In the past couple of weeks I have chatted up with two eligible bachelors who have stated they were interested in me for more than a hookup.&nbsp; In both cases I readily agreed to meet them as they were:   1) Single, gay&nbsp;and breathing  2) Younger than my own years.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gentleman #1&nbsp;was about 8 years younger than me and Gentleman # 2 was 1 year younger than me  3) Attractive.&nbsp; This was determined either through photographical evidence or based on their profile's description and built up in my own single and lonely mind that I imagined a god-like creature I would willingly bow down to and perform his bidding.  4) Had a good personality; at least&nbsp;for the short time we chatted.&nbsp; Gentleman # 1 and I even went so far as to engage in an actual&nbsp;conversation bia the telephone.&nbsp; This last point is by no means a small one, most gay men I chat with are either aloof, vain, too competitive, too picky; holding out for their own interpretation of what they feel is the perfect specimen of manhood or in general, they suffer from any discerning sign of any personality.   In both cases all signs pointed to a potential match, so as I said; I readily agreed to meet them, in a public place for coffee or dinner.&nbsp; Sadly in both cases I was, as they say, stood up.&nbsp; I can't, for the life of me, understand why an otherwise seemingly intelligent human being would agree to meet at a specified time and place and then turn out to be a no-show.&nbsp; I presented full disclosure in my profile, photos, chat.....I was genuinely interested in whatever they had to offer.&nbsp; Had they shown up and it turned out not to be a match, well....no harm, no foul.&nbsp; &nbsp;Try as I might I can't figure out what the charge would have been for each of them to have agreed and not meet, it's not as though we had a lengthy exchange of sexual dialogue wherein they, on their end of the internet line were jerking off.&nbsp; When I think back on the chat it was rather innoucuous if not pleasant.&nbsp;   Why would a guy not show up? What is the point?&nbsp; Could it have been some bizarre frat hazing?&nbsp; Dude, see if you can get a queer to meet you and you can join our fraternity.&nbsp; Seeing as it is only July, this doesn't seem likely.&nbsp; Aside from being frustrating it is a&nbsp;hurtful and aggrevating thing to&nbsp;go through; in the case of&nbsp;Gentleman #1, &nbsp;I drove 20 miles out of my way to meet for dinner.&nbsp; All systems were go&nbsp;to the extent we chatted on the phone as I arrived.&nbsp; And then I waited.&nbsp; And waited.&nbsp; And waited.&nbsp; For 90 minutes I waited in hopes an ambulance would pull up to carry an attractive, yet&nbsp;injured &nbsp;gentleman to the hospital suffering from a bad fall caused by running down his apartment stairwells well en route to meeting me at street level.&nbsp; Alas no ambulance arrived and dejected, I turned on my heels and headed back to my car and back to my own more comfortable, yet lonely surroundings.   Gentleman #2&nbsp;and I agreed to meet at a Border's bookstore for coffee.&nbsp; After arriving five minutes early I grabbed a sugar free cappucino-like drink and sat down, eagerly awaiting his arrival, &nbsp;among the crowd gathered around the cafe area.&nbsp;&nbsp; At that point, it certainly hadn't occured to me that I could be stood up twice in 9 days.&nbsp; I mean, who could have such a run of bad luck in meeting a potential life mate?&nbsp; After breezily reading a newspaper I glanced at my watch to realize that Gentleman # 2 was 25 minutes late.&nbsp; As anal retentive as I may be, I sucked in my breath and resigned myself to relax.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course he was going to show up.   Lacking any reading material after completing the newspaper; I jaunted over to the Film & Performing Arts section, which of course I default to in any bookstore and spied a&nbsp;hereto undiscovered book&nbsp;on Alfred Hitchcock.&nbsp; Snatching it up I returned to the cafe and comfortably sank down onto a leather sofa and began discovering all over again the Master of Suspense's filmography and tricks of the trade.&nbsp; Another hour passed before I realized, to my horror that...to quote Piper Laurie in "Carrie", "He's not coming.&nbsp; He's not gonna come."   Alone and dejected, I drove&nbsp;home.  It may not have turned out to be her dream date, but&nbsp;even Carrie got to go to&nbsp;the prom.   &nbsp;   to be continued....
I alternately feel determined and hopeless in my quest to change my body from a fatty fat to a hottie hot.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have 20 plus years of sins to eradicate and sometimes I think I am kidding myself.&nbsp; It's been only three weeks since I started seeing a trainer (oh if only I could be saying that same sentence and ending it with the word "socially") so I realize any changes that may possibly be occuring are hidden under inches of blubber.&nbsp; I say this not to continue to beat myself up but because tonight I had a minor victory.&nbsp; Mind you, the operative word is minor, but I still consider the following a victoy.  Over the past three weeks Jose has attempted to get me to do crunches.&nbsp; Not the garden variety mind you, I am able to do those; but rather a special type of crunch I have never heard of, nor has anyone I have inquired has quite understood as well.&nbsp; While lying on the mat, he has&nbsp;me raise my legs vertically.&nbsp; As I take the form&nbsp;of a human equivelant of a right angle I am to do crunches.&nbsp; In the past I can barely get my legs up; I think mostly because he has me do these crunches at the end of the workout, when all my energy has been depleted.&nbsp; I don't like failing, particularly in front of someone else&nbsp;and more than that&nbsp;I don't ever want to let Jose down.&nbsp; I grant you that last part makes no s
