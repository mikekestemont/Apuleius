Last night I said goodbye to a really good friend who is moving to Florida, I will see her again.  This morning I said goodbye to my grandpa, I will not see him again.   "There are few things pure in this world anymore and home is one of the few."     It's been a rough 24, and tonight starts the goodbye process for my cousin who is moving to Hawaii.   "I feel home when I see the faces that remember my own."    "Feelin alright, heading out tonight..."   Exactly.  Last night wasn't enough, although the girls nights always seem to make me smile.   "Well in the end we can all call a friend well that's something I know is true.  And then a thousand years and a thousand tears, I'll come back to my original crew."     Peace.Love.DMB.  |13 days|
Wow, I leave for a few days, and look what Grey's done with the place!  Excellent work, my dear.  I should have you come over and see if you can work similar wonders with my house.  Well, my trip was long and exhausting, but an absolute blast.  Altogether, I put 1,100 miles on my poor Oldsmobile, and probably 10 pounds on my waistline from all that ballpark food.  Between Sunday and Monday, I plan on posting a sort of travelogue with stories and pics (I snapped over 200... jeez) from all of my stops.  And even though I was traveling by myself the whole time, I never felt alone.  You see, a few months back, a good friend of mine burned me a 3-disc bootleg of a Dave Matthews-Tim Reynolds concert from Purdue in '03.  I took it on the road with me, and it rocked me to sleep every night.  Gee, I wonder who could possibly be cool enough to give me something like that... hmm.  Anyway, there's no rest for the weary, as I'm headed back to work this afternoon.  And right after that, one of the peeps from work is throwing a party, so I'll be shuffling over there, with my party companion, the Green Fairy.  (You don't know the Green Fairy?  Oh, no no no... I'll address this situation later.)  And then... back to work at 8 in the morning!  Sheesh.  So yeah, there are things to see and stories to tell, and hopefully they'll all be up and around soon.  Also, I've noticed that we've yet to receive one comment on this blog.  I mean, I know it's only been up a week, but a little feedback sure would brighten things up.  Maybe if I start posting naked pictures of myself...
rock  a rock of shape unyielded by a mulitude of events; emotionless form with very few dents  though time and time again it has remained unchanged for what might be forced upon; seemd so endless against the light of dawn  rock of a soul that stays silent  as space it fills; its spirit stays quiet against the rocks will  the rock stands strong, uncautioned and alert; unknown of pain, suffering and hurt.  my rock remains still through events of surprise and wear; dumb of knowing how much a rock can care  yet the rock stays on its own; cast in the shadows for rock is alone.
red  writing in red to project an infinite passion, a longing to feel your lips press  mine. as the soul waltzes the moon in its boundless circles conquering joy contained within the softness of your sensual  receptors. dreaming that one day this suppressed passion  will be released in the key that is your lips longing for a kiss say no word when the time has come to join us just kiss and grow red
I just posted a pic of my best friend,  urlLink SuperFly ,I guess it was taken at  urlLink 'The Bar'  some crazy drunken night.   If you read the article,take in mind, that was just one Domers opinion.  Hell, we are even mentioned  urlLink here   OK,OK--enough with the damn links in one post.  I get carried away.
Posting isn't that much fun alone.  Where are you Sod?  Somewhere in another state.  I texted him last night before my class, but I got nothing.  Hope he didn't drive down that 8 mile.  :-/   Class was exciting, like always. I can't wait for finite math!!  All those numbers and functions and stats.... oh boy!  I had chips and m&m's for dinner while thinking about my psychology prof.  hehe.  That's another story.  After class I went down to  'The Bar' , where I always go when I say I'm going out.  Drank some Miller Light and watched my two friends play a mean game of pool.  Won against two guys.  Don't you just love that?!?  I do!  They were good sports though.  My friend KR had played some music around 9:30pm and we were still waiting to hear  'Nicotine & Gravy'  at 11:00pm.  I ended up doing the Play Now and heard it right away.  Yey Me!  Such a good song.  You know what else is a good song... urlLink this is a GREAT SONG ! check out the entire site while you're at it.  I can't get enough.  Only 15 more days and I'll be dancing in the lawn.  Can you tell I'm excited?!?  I have an exam tonight in Psych. and then I don't know what I'm doing.  Maybe I'll go to Target and get some stuff n' things.  Shopping isn't that much fun, but it's got to be done.  I always want to buy music.  Something else worth checking out is  urlLink jambands   OK, I think I've posted enough for today.  Hurry Home Sod!  ...  Peace.Love.DMB.
Before noon today Sophia decided that filling a bag full of cotton balls would be a neat thing to do.  Then she proceeded to 'make a trail' from the kitchen to the family room with a roll of paper towels.  After all that, she wanted chips and cheese.  So she got the shredded cheese out and was shaking that all over the kitchen.  As I said, all before noon today.  Mo hasn't done anything too exciting, but he d
