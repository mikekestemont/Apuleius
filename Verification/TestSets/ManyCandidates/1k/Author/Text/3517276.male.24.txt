Wow. It's like the old BOA, but slightly more confusing.
don't have scales,  urlLink it turns out . i was as surprised as anyone.
damn you all. i'm still here for an hour yet. but i have read the review, and pronounce it Unforgiving.
I'm going home.
It works for me. Shall I just copy and paste it?
Yeah, OK, it's not working and I can't be arsed to fix it.  It's been a bit temperamental recently.  I'll e-mail a draft of it to you instead dave.
Christ I'm having a stressful day.  I'm pretty much legging it now to get my scarecut before I leap on the train at Broadstairs to bum Dave.  The TDAT review should be working, if not, it's not my fault and I have no inclination to do anything about it.   urlLink So there
I've done shockingly little work today. I have, in fact, spent a large proportion of it on the interweb.  I also downloaded the 14 day trial of Star Wars: Galaxies last night, all two gig of it. I'm moist with anticipation. I think I may create a wookiee exotic dancer.
i never got to see it. is your site working again yet, uncle fonz?
watch me as i monkey around with your post. tee hee.
Ahh. I was just trying to find an appropriate size, but you done beat me to it.
that's you, that is.
I broke it. But tee hee anyway.
Whilst and amongst are archaic versions, apparently. But still equally valid.
this is becoming some kind of necessity here too - this fecher is just a bit too bright and obvious. i'd like to leave this template for posterity if possible and come up with some alternatives for the more sensitive among us, so does anyone know how to take the blogger output and run it through another page? anyone?  christ, customising the boa was hella-easy. i miss that boa. well, in a way.  and what's the difference between among and amongst? anyone? and while and whilst? someone should know.
or poor eyesight. you've probably got great big godzilla eyes too, haven't you?
I see. The other its. Piss off.  Why do I sometimes see the XML buttons, and sometimes not?
As in 'it is the future'. Or were you talking about something else?
you need a rest, guy. why has no-one complimented me on my nice buttons? or the johnson quote about yoav at the top? why am i always doomed be ignored, and my art overlooked in favour of crude populist hackery?
That's because your reader is Too Straight, like you. You need to loosen up. Hey relax, fella.
my reader doesn't. anywoo, you can just click on one of those XML links over there, and things will look hella different. honest.
Most feed readers will work with Atom, anyway.
blogger uses atom xml, rather than rss. but fear not - i've just converted it to rss with feedburner. take a look at the cheeky XML link on high on the right. there you go. that's not so bad, is it?
It's the future, man.  Fonz, you could get yourself a feed reader (Google for it), and then look at the BOA using it's RSS feed. It'll just look like you have an email program open, or somesuch.
there must be another way to get at the content of the site without all the botting. i'll have a luke.
It's no good, this site is drawing too much attention.  I can't look at this at work, I've already got in trouble once today.  If I don't get something as inconspicuous as PISS back, I'll have to stop using it.
Having misspelled 'Fonz' in an earlier post, I have decided to complete the job. From now on, I shall refer to him as 'Diddy Bot Fonx'.
i am a pulling 66%er. that makes me a little better than ross. which makes sense to me. i am also 30% gay, which is too straight.  i think that these tests are indeed "balls".
I didn't half panic when that needle went all the way up to 100% gay, til I realised it was just calculating my score.  I am 26% gay, which is apparently &quot;Too Straight&quot;.
Drunk Fonx would get 4% and irreperably stained trousers.
I was brutally honest in the pull-o-meter, and I got 54%. I am a Shy Guy.  Seems about right.  Of course, that was Sober Fonz taking the test.  If Drunk Fonz were taking the test, who knows what score he'd get?
I'm 43% gay, and apparently a 'happy and well adjusted hetero man'. See, it must be true if Channel 4 says it.  I also have a 62% chance of pulling, and it says:  'Always in control, and that often works out the best on a holiday night out, But stop playing it so safe! We know its not cool to get wasted, but you need to let down your hair and live a little! Perhaps a bit of dutch courage will give you that pep you need to go for it a bit more.'  I'm a little confused by that, as I chose to go without food and went for the beers, so would be legless by about half way round.
I took one of those gay tests before, where it reckoned everyone was at least 37% gay on average.  I think I was 1% nmore hetero than average, which surprised me as much as anyone.
See if you are  urlLink good at pulling ...I got 81%. Go here to see how  urlLink gay you are  Fonz anything less than 50% and I know you are lying! I got 29% which is just the right amount of gayness. If the above links come out stupid apologies...I just copied fonz's code and pasted
If you use the 'post a full message' link, and use the interweb link button to insert the hutchtemel for you, it doesn't add the target=blank shiznit by default. Is there a way to change that, or am I going to have to learn something, and do my linking myself?
makes the target of the link open in a new window. thing is, my work pc usually has about 9 ie windows open at any one p
