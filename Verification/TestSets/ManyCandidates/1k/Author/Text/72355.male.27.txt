I saw a show on discovery about the Komodo dragon, and they mentioned that it has a "mouth full of putrefaction" while showing an ox dying from an infected bite wound. Sounds like me when I wake up. I had to switch to all-cotton pillows because I kept melting the polyester ones.  "No E-mail, only hot dog." -sony commercial. "Psst! It's me - Death. I'll see you soon, OK? I know you can't hear me, but try to feel what I'm about to say, deep down in your soul - Don't eat the gazpachooo."                                       -Manny Calavera, "Grim Fandango"
So, Here is the first entry into my  Blogger  powered pseudo-journal. wait - meta-journal. no... um... "Journalesque Stream Of Thought." (Journalesque Stream Of Thought &copy; 1972 eclipse studios) So, if this works, I shall have a place on my website which I can use to post random thoughts that wouldn't quite fit into anything else. I already have a section for this (core), but that is more for structured rants and such. At this point in time I would like to say "Eugene" 4 times: Eugene Eugene Eugene Eugene. I would also like to state that Escargot is a really bad name for snails. They should be labeled "Snails" in bold print. just to let you know, so you don't order them while trying to show off for a date or something ("Ah kin reed fraynch, gimme one of them thar escargots"). The menu should say in large text just above the name of the dish: "NOTICE: There are snails in this dish. If you order it, you will be expected to eat multiple snails"

I am Tiger Woods. And I'm not even too sure who Tiger Woods is. I am Tiger Woods&copy; wearing Michael Jordan&copy; cologne and Nike&copy; sneakers in my Buick&copy; listening to the Britney Spears&copy; cd I got from McDonalds&copy;. Did domebody say McDonalds&copy;? uh, Yeah, I just did. Anyway, I got the cd for only 2.99 when I got a Big Mac&copy; after I saw the commercial on NBC&copy; that came on during the Olympics&copy;, which took place in Australia&copy;.  Oh yeah, Mir isn't gonna be scrapped after all. Turns out, somebody raised enough money to buy all that space-lysol, and they won't send Mir spiraling into the earth in february. The space-fungus was unavailable for comment. Somebody needs to make a movie about the heroic space-lysol. SPAAAAAAAAAAAACE LYYYYYYYYSOOOOOLLLLLLLLL  IN THE 21ST CENTURY!!!!!!!!

Trust me - I checked an awful lot to make sure I felt like less of a man than I should. What I'm trying to say is, I've never seen "First Blood" all the way thru. In fact, I think the only Stallone movie I have seen all the way thru was Demolition man. I think I am less of a man because of this, and I need to get tough and go rent all 17 rocky movies and watch them straight thru. Or I could go look at flowers. No. Flowers are the wrong thing. I could...... Step on some flowers. No. Uhhhh...... well. I could always be an alchoholic womanizer with a beer gut and 5 o'clock shadow all the time... I'd be a real man then. Of course, I could just have some deep seated psychological problem with Stallone. Yeah, maybe I saw Sly naked when I was a kid or something and it scarred me for life, and now I can't see him in a movie without getting the urge to change the channel. But then again, I might just not like any of his movies. Sylvester Stallone, if you read this, Lemme know if you used to expose yourself to little boys, then my questions will all be answered. well, that one will be. the one about having grilled cheese sandwiches with the lead singer of INXS on a spaceship will have to wait.
The Mir Spacestation is getting a lot of press of late. Apparently, there is some nasty space-fungus eating the plastic on the old rustbucket. If MirCorp (the company that is in control of Mir) doesn't get 7-10 million dollars (presumably to buy lots and lots of lysol.) within a few weeks, they will have to scrap Mir next February. another problem: NBC is going to have to think up something quick, because they had a new survivor-esque series in the works, wherein the winner gets to go to Mir. Fat chance of getting on Mir if it's destined to crash into the Earth. now, on top of all that - James "I directed Titanic, and you?" Cameron is actually going to be going to Mir to spend some time. I assume he is trying to get ideas for a new movie, since he went on a sub and saw THE Titanic, and then shortly thereafter made that movie "Bismarck", or something to that effect.  urlLink RANDOM "I WANNA BE LIKE MARTHA STEWART" LINK  (Random "I wanna be like Martha Stewart &copy;1987 eclipse studios)  urlLink RANDOM COOL MUSIC LINK  (Random cool music link &copy;1849 eclipse studios)  urlLink RANDOM UNCOOL MUSIC LINK  (Random uncool music link &copy;1850 eclipse stu-stu-studios) On another note: "Space-Fungus" would be a really cool name for a band. Ditto for "I wanna be like Martha Stewart". maybe a ska band could use that second one....
