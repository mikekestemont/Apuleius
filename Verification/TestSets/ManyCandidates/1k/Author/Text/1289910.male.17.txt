just watched mean girls yesterday and it was a fun movie. not only because of the story and humorous language but it was because of lindsay lohan!i dont know what happened to that girl... from a young, innocent girl from parent trap she turned into this teenage sex symbol in mean girls. well regardless on how she changed, it was all good and im lovin it. she's so hot...hehe        i just thought while watching the movie... do you really have to be mean in order to fit in and survive?   in my case, im not really a mean person... ok maybe a little but my meanness is tolerable, i think... but anyweiz, i think with my happy go lucky, wild personality im showing everyone, the onlye thing i dont get is R-E-S-P-E-C-T... i dont know but its such an issue to me. if getting 'mean' means people will be afraid to mess with you and will earn you respect even in a negative way, i'd rather be mean! maybe im just so tired of being the butt of 'some' (not really 'all') jokes. for years now its always been the same, im the tall guy with the big nose with all the 'kabastusan' in mind, who prioritizes extra curricular activities more than the academics.. a class officer who tries to lead a class who find it so hard to pay repsect and listen... the misunderstood son/nephew or black sheep rather in the house who would think first of his friends welfare rather than himself. and the person (or is it animal?) who always has a smile on his face which is an irony of his true emotions.   well there is no one more to blame than of course myself because whatever it is happening right now is a result of all my actions. i let it happened... and i cant just go blaiming other people for my own stupidity. people disrespect me because that is how i showed my personality. do you think if i just shut up and isolate myself from all of them, they will still do the things they do to me now... of course not... sometimes its better not to exist i guess.   im just hoping that the next time someone even tried to mess with me i could channel all my anger and just explode. its hard keeping it all inside you know...
we had our first general assembly today at mediartrix. it was ok. we have a chance to interact with the new members. i wouldnt say that it was very organized but we managed to survive and went on with the GA. we had some difficulties with the venue since the guard is asking for a formal letter. thnx to kapatid na sam and we succssfully reserved the AVR which is a better venue compared to the origibal one which is only a room. the GA couldve been better with some performances from dang and ate joy but ok na rin yung kanina... i do hope that the new members enjoyed it.  &nbsp;  mama called before i left for the GA and i talked with jef... papasok na daw cya ng school on monday and he is very excited na. i talked with kuya din and i can tell he doesnt want to share with me his salary since he doesnt want to give me even a slight idea on how much he is being paid.  &nbsp;  before i end this journal entry i would like to ask kung si britney ba to? i got this email saying that it came from her 400M dollar photoshoot with playboy    &nbsp;          &nbsp;    &nbsp;
For the first time i went home early (mga before 12) and i had all afternoon to myself. instead of sleeping all day i updated the  mediartrix  website and posted the list of successful applicants for this year. i also updated the  nadine samonte official website  specially the forums since a guy named jonathan oandasan who is so assuming that he claims himself as nadine's boyfriend from canada and that he will be coming home here to be a star. i bet he couldnt even make it to the auditions haha. whoever he is, i hope he just shut up. i already made necessary courses of action (i deleted and banned him from the message board)so i dont think he will be bothering me anymore.  We dont have classes tomorrow so im planning to do something productive with my time since bihira kami mawalan ng pasok. But regardless of the "holiday", sobrang pagod pa rin ako, kulang sa tulog and cyempre ngarag.
it was a tough day for me.   i tried to wake up early to make my english assignment which i eventually finished (i wrote it in the house,the fx and in the AB stairs). I was late for english which really disappointed me because the very reason i was late is that i was cramming for the assigment. i worked so hard then i wouldnt be able to submit it?!?!?! Good thing mam perena still accepted it though i was marked absent.   i managed to survive math because  i didnt finish the exercises... thnx to peaches i got a passing grade because as mam dictates the answers she wrote it in my workbook, hehe. Talk about cheating huh  i also did the photocopying duties for filipino although i got so pissed at those people who doesnt pay the amount to be payed and worse to those people who are very disrespectful and inconsiderate of all my efforts. SANA MAKARMA KAYO! ****** ** nyo! Just pray na di kayo mapagbalingan ko when the time comes na napuno na ako promise. You'd wish you shouldve studied in FEU rather than in UST.  I also survived the journalese meeting. thank god ate deni didnt look at the proposed logo she asked me to do. the website layout is due on tues so i hope i can make it on time.   i havent posted the list of succesfull applicants for mediartrix nor called the new members for t
