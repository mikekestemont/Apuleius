I went to see Shrek 2 today.  Must get the soundtrack to both it and Shrek part 1.  The movie was really good.  Despite all the screaming kids that were in the theater.  I mean, I like kids, but shit.  I don't like to be in an enclosed theater with hundreds of them.  And the lady sitting next to me felt the need to repeat everything that was remotely funny.  I just tried to go to my happy place and tune everyone out but the movie.
...this weekend at Riverfest in Little Rock.  It was really awesome.  My friends and I were totally all up in the mosh pit.  There were peeps crowd surfing and everything.  And just about everybody around me was rockin' the Gonj.  I myself did not partake but probably got a little contact high.  We saw Hootie and the Blowfish on Friday night but the main event was Uncle Kracker and Collective Soul on Saturday night.  They rocked so HARD!!!  I definitely need to go to more concerts.  Nelly and I are gonna see Elton John and Blue Man Group in August when we go to Vegas.  Can't wait!  We also had a Buffy marathon at Nelly's this weekend.  I brought my shiny new season 6 boxset.  We watched multiple episodes and episodes with commentary.  And special features!  So, in other words: my weekend friggin' ROCKED.  And Mandy and Nelly have convinced me to go skydiving in the fall.  The main selling point for me was that they make a video of you skydiving AND YOU GET TO PICK THE MUSIC.  I am totally doing Eye of the Tiger.
I just drank one of those new Orange Zimas, and guess what?  My ears don't hurt anymore.  I think I'll have another!  5.9% alcohol by volume, baby!
Had a major false alarm today.  My uncle Robbie calls me at work today, frantic.  He was asking me if I could get over to my Meemaw's house because he was trying to call her.  He said someone kept picking up the phone and it sounded like they were struggling for breath.  My Meemaw has a history of repiratory problems, so I am immediately picturing her lying on the floor of her house, clutching the phone and trying to breathe.  So I jumped up and flew out of the parking lot and called my stepdad.  I was blubbering and hysterical.  Finally I was able to convey to him that I thought Meemaw was in trouble.  So, he called the police and then headed over there himself.  I beat the police over there and it turns out Meemaw wasn't even home.  The police pulled in after me and then Carey.  I'm telling the police officer what's going on and then Peepaw walks out of the house asking what the heck is going on.  He explains to me that they don't know how to work the answering machine properly.  So we went in and listened to the answering machine and it did resemble the sound of someone struggling for breath.  If it hadn't scared the shit out of me, it would be funny.  Maybe I'll laught later.    And to top it all off, my allergies are kicking the shit out of me.  My ears hurt, my eyes hurt, and my head hurts.  And I'm losing my voice.  So, fun, in other words.
Just want to see what this looks like.
I saw Dodgeball and Fahrenheit 9/11 this weekend.  Both were really good movies for different reasons.  Dodgeball was hilarious.  I don't know why I find people getting hit with balls to be so hilarious.  It just is.  And even more fun, Mom and I popped our own popcorn and hid the bags in her huge purse.  We also snuck in our own sodas.  And my dad had won free movie passes and gave them to me, so we got to really stick it to the overpriced movie theater establishment.    Fahrenheit 9/11 was also excellent.  While I don't agree with everything that Michael Moore says, I really respect the fact that he has the balls to say it.  And it needs to be said.    I think he's a really good film-maker.  He knows how to strike the right nerve and really get all over people.  If you like Bush, I wouldn't recommend this movie.  I personally can't stand him and wouldn't vote for him even if he was running against Satan himself.  The same goes for Cheney, Ashcroft, and Rumsfeld. That's right.  I said it.  Come and get me Patriot Act enforcers.  This movie brought some things to the surface that I had been feeling about the direction our country has taken in the past few years.  And it reminded me that I was still bitter that Gore "lost" the 2000 election.  Moore makes a lot of great points in this documentary and I think he hit the nail on the head a lot better than in Bowling for Columbine.
So, Mom and I have been doing Weight Watchers for the past week.  And I actually lost 5 1/2 pounds.  Go me!  Mom gained a pound.  And I really haven't been following the point system that strictly.  I've just been generally cutting back.  Eating more veggies and fruits and less fat and sugar.   So, hopefully by August I'll have shed 10 or 15 pounds.    See, WW is all about Portion Control.  Everytime I think about Portion Control I automatically think of Prince's song "Pussy Control".  And one of these days I'm going to be wanting to say portion and actually say pussy.  And that will be funny.
Well, I got my rejection letter for the job I applied for today.  It was for a staff auditor at the bank I work for.  I'm a little bummed, but I just have to keep on keeping on.  I've got a nice little collection of them that I can add it to.  That kind of helps, that I've been through it before.  But it's never fun to be rejected.  I just have to repeate my mantra:  It wasn't meant to be. Something else w
