Yes, you're totally right and I agree with almost everything you said.  Obviously as long as anyone is alive, they are "living life."  Life is experience.  And experience is found in every waking moment.  I think what I should have said was this:  for me, personally, what I find most fulfilling to  my  life are such activities as painting and writing (etc.) and that I do not find activities like watching TV and playing board games  as  fulfilling (to what ideas I have in my head of a meaningful life (whatever that means in the midst of all this absurdity!), and enjoyment/pleasure I get from the act of thinking about stuff, and as satisfying my ground-projects that I've set myself for life (like becoming a writer, wanting to understand my reality more (i.e., philosophize), and other certain, specific activities that my particular being finds distinctly enjoyable (i.e., fulfilling)).    I was wrong to generalize my personal feelings about my personal life to be applied to life in general.  Not everybody (for example) would find philosophy fulfilling (in fact most don't) so I shouldn't be ascribing my own value system to people in general when the values I place on these activities are simply my own.  I don't think everyone  should  do philosophy (or the same things in general) because if everyone pursued the same activities, that would just make for a very boring society.  Like you said on the phone last night, life is found in the variety of experience, not just the experience of certain variety.    Now for a few more directed responses to explore some more specific issues:  1. "[Your distinction] puts these activities into two completely separate and different (opposing) categories"  You're right, and I believe I was being overly dramatic in my distinction between "living life" activities and "waiting to die" activities.  But I do think there exists a distinction between what-I-find-fulfilling activities and what-I-do-not-find-fulfilling activities.  This is purely subjective and personal on my part and thus I do not believe it can (or should be) generalized to everybody (we're each our own selves with different what-I-find-fulfilling interests).    What I would like to point out, though, is that given this subjectivity, I then would believe that  my  what-I-find-fulfilling activities are (to me) "living life" activities, and vice versa.  When I am participating in what-I-do-not-find-fulfilling activities, I sometimes start to  feel  like I'm just "waiting to die."  I can hear you saying now that all activities are valuable for the experiences they provide us in life.  Playing board games allows for social interactions (beyond the board game proper) and watching TV is sometimes desirable beyond ground-projects like writing etc.  You're right that if I spent all my time "just writing" I would feel equally unfulfilled (and in fact my writing would become incredibly boring due to my lack of anecdotal experience upon which I could draw for material).   There needs to be a balance .    Variety is important.  Sometimes I will indeed (need to) watch television and vedge out, and do other such activities which do not necessarily directly contribute to my ground-projects/fulfilling-experiences.  The enjoyment I find in those other experiences is relative to the other experiences I have (not that the other one's are "lesser" or something, but just different kinds/ways of living life that contrast and define all the other kinds/ways).  All I'm saying is that each of us has certain activities we find  more  fulfilling than others and that when faced with these "others" we may not necessarily always enjoy them (or find them fulfilling) even though they can be experiences and can be living life and can be good.  They may not always feel good or be what we want to be doing.  Why should we force ourselves to do something we don't enjoy just because we think that all experiences are good?    I think all experiences have a positive value to them, but I don't believe that all experiences have an equal amount of that value (but I believe that the distribution of value is something that I've set for myself, personally... others may have different distributions which may put watching TV at a higher priority than wasting time typing nonsense into a computer ;)  So when one of my experiences "uses up" its value for me (whatever "using up" means and in whatever way I am able to measure value:  I think this is something subconscious (i.e., I "just feel it" or "just know" rather than having a conscious status report of my value distributions and their varying levels of satisfaction)) I may not necessarily want to (or enjoy) continuing that experience.  In such a circumstance I may even feel like I'm not enjoying (or "living") my life.  Let me qualify this feeling a little more so it's not as severe as I'm probably sounding.  In all experiences, I believe there is a wide range of combined values being had at any one time.  So, for instance, when I'm watching TV, I may loose interest in the TV proper but still be enjoying the conversations I'm having with my friends, hugging me girl friend (that's you ;), eating some food, or just relaxing my brain.  What I mean is that "watching TV" is not  just  watching TV, but involves a bunch of other activities which may have value for me as well.  But on some rare occasions, I may get tired of all the associated activities and want to pursue some other satisfying/fulfilling activity.  And my saying out loud "I've had enough watching TV for now" may in fact mean that I've had enough with watching TV  and  its associated activities.    I don't think there's anything wrong with this though.  I'm not trying to devalue any particular activity in particular, only that I'd like to express that particular activities for particular people can be particularly more or less valuable.   2.
