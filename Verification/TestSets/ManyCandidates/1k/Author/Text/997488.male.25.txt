i'm not feeling introspective today, so i will write nothing.
baltimore is rainy today, but not too cold. the leaves have all turned red, so it's really beautiful, especially on my street. i love rain. if i took a photograph of my street right now, it'd be almost like a postcard, with old colorful houses, cobblestone road, shiny drenched ground, and red and yellow leaves everywhere. and no one would probably guess it's baltimore (except for the rowhouses, which would be a dead giveaway), the crime/homocide/drug/poverty capital of america. it's like paul simon's kodachrome song, "makes you think all the world's a sunny day." poor balto; it can actually be quite lovely. amazing what we've done to this city, and much of the world. mankind's impact on the earth and itself boggles the mind. we've just finished the week-long human behavior course. one of the lectures was on drug abuse and addiction, in which we had to read an excerpt from "the corner," a rather famous piece about drug in baltimore. after that lecture i went home and watched traffic (courtesy of jon lee...still). it absolutely appalls me the magnitude of the drug problem and the depth to which it is injuring and murdering our people and society. yet isn't it all done to us by ourselves? from the movie, which was heralded as a not-so-unrealistic portrait, it paints an overwhelming picture of the drug problem in america. it was almost disheartening and discouraging. but there're lots that can and needs to be done. check this out: www.drugfreeamerica.com  on a lighter note, here're some great new from the world of formula one racing. jaguar team has secured two new drivers, although the rationale for bumping eddie irvine off the team is bizzare, borderlining stupid. (hopefully there are some good reasons behind it, 'cuz irvine has done respectably well for jaguar.) the r4 (next year's car) will be unveiled on january 13, 2003. best of luck to one of my favorite team. and jordan is jumping on the ford wagon, becoming another ford cosworth-powered team. yeah! i've always liked the jordan team. and team arrows will be amongst the entry next year, as it has been taken over the a german company. it's a bit of a disappointment, though, 'cuz i thought it was going to be taken over by the americans, reportedly dan gurney. arrows has always had real nice-looking cars. as for cart, it's quite a pity that so many famous teams ditched it for irl next year. in my opinion, cart is much more exciting than irl, what with its international stint, road and street courses, and big-time players that occassionaly jump over to formula and become stars. seems to me irl is somewhat of a nascar with open-wheeled racing machines; oval tracks are just not that exciting.
sung is upset because this isn't the same weblog site from his
per sung's suggestion, i have commenced posting some judiciously chosen products of my mind here on the internet. the probability of any random person surfing in and reading it is approximately 1,343,378,195,954,748 to 1, so i'd better spread the word to my three friends to increase the rating.
i...feel cold
hmm...i just changed the looks of this thing, how come it didn't work???
wow, haven't written for a while. but since no one is reading anyway, what does it matter??? i wonder if sung reads me stuff. sung, if you're reading this, you get a prize from me.  anyway, 3 more weeks until winter break; i can't wait. last night went to an NU alum meeting in DC. i guess i'm gonna be interviewing high school kids applying to NU, how exciting! DC is so nice, such a cool town. i love it. the drive there was kinda scary, though, no light or nothing on balto-wash pkwy. no billboards, either, which i guess was the point. i wish baltimore is as nice and cool as DC.  everyday i want a mazda RX-8 more and more! but i want to keep connie, too. if i win the lottery, i would save 35 grand of that and buy an RX-8 in the summer. i want either a yellow or blue one, 6-speed manual, loaded, and then i'll paint the wheels flat black, lower it, put in HID lights, and turbocharge it. i've rekindled my love for japanese cars...  took an exam yesterday; molecular and cell crap. i hate exams, they just come and go and make me feel violated and insulted. now i'm waiting for the clock to strike 3 to meet w/ someone to work on my clinical conference stuff. i'm so bored; i definitely need more things and people going on in my life. i miss ken my old roommate and that old antique apartment in evanston. that was so much fun. i miss evanston a great deal, though i heard it's getting snowy and cold there, much worse than here. i really miss evanston a lot, the water, the stores, the eats, the beach (even though they're fake), the yacht club and all. i don't think i really want to go back there and live, though. i miss my time there, but it wouldn't be the same if i went back there and lived and worked there now; it'd be like going back to an empty house that you grew up in. think i'll visit chicago in spring break...  i want an RX-8...
i'm back home in Los Angeles. strangely, it feels very weird being back. a lot's changed here; my dad did quite a lot of changes to the house, that it doesn't feel so much like my house anymore. it's very very weird...
went to a comedy club a couple nights ago in hollywood. it was 4 hours long! it was pretty funny, but for the most part it was quite vulgar and crude, definitely rated r. except for a few of them, it wasn't really that classy, which is kinda sad.
bored
i just found out christopher walken is hosting tonight's snl! i wish i had a tv =( i want to see the c
