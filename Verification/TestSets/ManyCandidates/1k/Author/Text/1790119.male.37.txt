Quote from a jammajampa blog reader. "(Eric)...don't you think that the car (STi) is a bit suped up ..i know what you're thinking...it can't ever get too suped up.. but it is starting to look a bit ghetto...i mean that in the  nicest way..."   Several folks who are also "not in the know" have commented similarly. Saying this car is Fast&Furious, Low rider ...and on and on.   I'm not insulted...but rather my mission is to now help educate the masses regarding this cars true purpose.   it this .... urlLink Tommi in action at Swedish Rallye  ..as opposed to this.... urlLink Neon nonsense   Next stop...

Busy fathers day . Got chocolate croissants in bed... (as did the kids). Got to clean leaves etal off the roof. and go to the O's game with Logan (They won but we only lasted 3 innings). Fun anyway. Logan wanted bball cards for his "Vinder" ..maybe he grew tired of all the pokemon cards..NOT ! Took the scooby and tried to varying the speed the whole way. ..put on close to 100 miles..   We're reading mythological tales and Logan told Kate all about Pegasus and the constellations..We did the planitarium like last year and he remembered out of the blue! kid is a genuis. Jay is battling Logan for attention while also being his shadow. Logan says, "lets go marching".. Jay repeats him, "yeah! le go machin" .. Just in case you did hear.  Shots from the game coming soon urlLink  view from game seats    urlLink Logan as catcher    urlLink Dad stickin out of side    urlLink air Logan in moonbounce    urlLink Peace!
well im still traveling...now in FL.   CT was "fun", although it could have been better if Kate was feeling 100% (strep throat) and myself (who knows what I have apart from coughing up a lung every now and then.) Kate has quickly adopted a NY attitude. Wonder how long it'll last?   Central FL is like the midwest...only hotter. I sucked big time in golf today. Scramble play. At least there was one person in our foursome even worse. We still finished our round 4 under par.. I just thought I was better than how I actually played.  Thats all for now
testing some images for forum avatars       you likey?

Great sounding car!!!  urlLink scoobysport.wav  (right click to save and download. then play) Yes this is a Subaru.
contract on the house! full price! lets hope it sticks!
Today Logan said to Kate, "you know that girl... when we were at the bus stop..she went pyscho on me!" Apparently has a crush on him and was chasing him around! Teenagers!
So the house is now on the market ..sign in ground.. etal..  Fingers are crossed that we get truly good offers.   Oh well.. even if we dont, we've fixed the house up pretty damn good. Logan let the cat-out-of-the-bag last weekend when he told Whitten who then told Jesse. I think that was relief to Kate so she could then tell everyone before they actually saw the sign in the ground!    Logan's latest is wanting me to buy Yu Gi OH cards off ebay. The rare ones (Slifer the Sky Dragon, Obelisk the Tormentor, and The Winged Dragon of Ra) are $80 bucks!! He's gonna be saving his money for a while.      Jay has been singing a cool song about the bad weather.. "Rain rain go away, come again another day" Adorable.
urlLink The Car Connection [ The Web´s Automotive Authority ]   Now this is very cool..wheel and all. However, the side decals are alittle over the top.
urlLink The Car Connection [ The Web´s Automotive Authority ]  I'm not sure why ..but I really like this vehicle. Seems to be a poor man' Porsche Cayanne (if you like that sort of thing)
I am testing the new Google 2.0 beta which includes ad-blocking. Also has a new blog this feature. I'll let you know how it works.  I'm helping organize an event for a dozen or so STI owners in the WDC/VA/DC area. We are doing a leisurely drive around the region. The idea is to show off and talk to each other about the cars and also help burn off some of the break in miles (1000 total). Personally, I'm already at 640 miles... so this works great. Its nothing t
