Hey everyone!    Well, surprisingly enough tomorrow I will be making my first trip on the Shinkansen (bullet train).  After talking to my parents and Dana as they explored Tokyo, I decided that I really should meet them in Kyoto!  A) I haven't been yet.  B) I somehow managed to gain some nenkyu (paid vacation days) and C) my family came all the way to Japan and as things previously stood I would only get to spend 4 days with them.  Luckily I was at my favorite school where the teachers are absolutely amazing and helped me to sort out all of the possible ways I could get back and forth to Kyoto (trains, buses...).    Armed with a little bit of information, I ventured in to Sendai to try my luck at a travel agent.  With my trusty electronic dictionary I entered the travel agent relatively prepared for the task at hand.  For 30 minutes the agent and I discussed possible routes via buses, trains, and even planes.  Writing down times and dates and using lots of gestures and my broken Japanese, I finally left with train tickets in hand.  Granted I paid a lot of money, but sometimes the satisfaction you get from having successfully accomplished something completely in Japanese makes the dent in the wallet not quite as painful.      So in less than 24 hours I will be seeing my family for the first time in 7 months.  If you can`t make it home, it is always nice for a little bit of home to come to you!  The next 25 days or so are going to be crazy...4 in Kyoto, family in Sendai for 4, Elizabeth comes to visit, a trip to Okinawa with three friends, I turn 23, and have a joint birthday party with my friend Jess.  What more could I want!

It's just another manic monday!  Actually, things here at school are incredibly quiet.  No classes, no students, no work...basically that leaves me searching the internet, reading, or watching the clock anxiously awaiting the end of the day.  Anyway, last week I was one of the guest ALT`s at the Izumi High School Winter English Camp.  So here is a brief overview of my experiences at the camp.   Most importantly, it was a lot of fun and a nice change of pace from the hours I ordinarily would have spent sitting at school doing absolutely nothing.  6 of the 7 other ALT's at the camp were loads of fun and it was definitely an incredible group they threw together.  Each of us was assigned a group of 10 students (I was group B) and the camp consisted of speech presentations, culture quizes, language classes(I taught Finnish), song performances, and drama productions.  Initially I thought I was given the Best group (Group B!) but early on I learned that the B stood for Bad group.   Some of my students were caught buying beers from the vending machines (yes there are beer vending machines everywhere in this country), one was kicked out for smoking, 7 skipped the drama practices,  another likes to become sick when it is convenient and she also went home, 3 skipped the culture quiz activites....you get the idea!  Nonetheless, overall it was a lot of fun but I know that if I had been given any of the 7 other groups my experience at the camp would have been even better and more enjoyable!  I am destined to have the trouble students throughout my stay in Japan.     Anyway, that is a brief overview of my days at winter camp.  I hope all of you are doing well and that things are starting to warm up whereever you are in the world.
Konnichiwa!  I have been receiving a lot of emails recently in regards to my decision to leave Japan and where I am going to go from here.  Basically, I am not quite sure just yet.  I realized that another 18 months here in Japan would not allow me to experience the things I am looking for or hoping to accomplish at this stage of my life.  While the past six months have provided me with loads of first-time experiences and amazing discoveries about myself, the culture here in Japan, and those around me, I don`t believe that the situation I am in will enable me to be happy and satisfied for as long as agreeing to recontract would require.  I have now read loads of books ranging from Japanese fiction to theories of evolution, and even recently a book about becoming evil and what leads ordinary people to commit genocide.  I am continuing to study Japanese and my Tuesday night class has proven to be somewhat beneficial in that I am guaranteed a little structure.  Basically, I am reading and learning about anything I can get my hands on which is leading me to believe that at some point in the near future I will probably return to school for either a law degree or my masters.  Although this doesn't really provide you with a clear picture of where I will be or what I will be doing over the upcoming year, hopefully it will at least explain (although probably not very clearly) why I am leaving this experience in search of another new opportunity.   Another quick plea...if you have any contacts anywhere in the world that you think might provide me with an opportunity to experience something new and learn a lot in the process please feel free to let me know.
