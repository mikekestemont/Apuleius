So my school's library is sooooo cold!  I had to bring a wool turtleneck sweater and winter socks today...so I can actually stand to stay here for more than half an hour.  Yikes!  I'm all bundled up and still cold. The cutest thing was in my apartment this morning.  I go under my desk to unplug my laptop and there's a little baby lizard (well, at least that's what I called it).  I quick got my camera and took pictures.  But it's tough to get a quality picture of something so small -- only about 1.5 inches from head to tip of tail!  So, if anyone who knows me is interested in seeing the pictures, let me know and I'll send you an email.
The above link SHOULD take you to an article, but I never trust that links are really going to work. This will be a very quick and dirty discussion of the article...I found myself commenting to myself a lot while reading it, so just thought I'd share a bit. The article begins, "Florida may not spend taxpayer dollars to send children to religious schools, a state appeals court ruled Monday, dealing another blow to Gov. Jeb Bush's voucher program...the Opportunity Scholarship Program violates a section of the Florida Constitution that bars public money from going to religious institutions" (Beth Kormanik and J. Taylor Rushing, Strike 2 against school vouchers, Fl. Times Union, August 16, 2004, at A1).  The voucher program allows students at failing schools (as determined by the State and probably under the guidelines from the No Child Left Behind Act) to use vouchers to attend private schools, both religious and non-religious.  Should such public schoolchildren choose a religious school, the school is not allowed to force them to "pray, worship or accept their beliefs" (id.). This particular rule leads to my first thought.  Doesn't that defeat the purpose and/or mission of, let's say, Christian schools??  I'm most familiar with christian schools, so I'll stick to talking about them.  I think that the main reason parents send their children to christian schools is to put them in an educational environment both where their beliefs are nurtured and where worship and prayer with classmates is encouraged.  Doesn't this make the school more like a secular or non-religious private school?  Will parents of "paying" students, then, be inclined to remove their children from the christian schools?  Aren't they paying the high tuition rates so that their children can go to school with other children from similar moral backgrounds? The coalition of groups originally filed this lawsuit back in 1999 based on the fact "that the vouchers program is unconstitutional and that it strips public schools of students and much-needed money" (id.).  One Florida christian school was actually the center of a scandal for accepting vouchers for students who no longer attended there.  The public school system can not afford to lose money this way. Apparently, the U.S. Constitution does not bar the use of vouchers in religious schools, however the Florida Constitution is more specific and says that "tax dollars shall not 'be taken from the public treasury directly or indirectly in aid of any church, sect or religious denomination or in aid of any sectarian institution'" (id., at A-4).  In this respect, I guess I'm a little confused about different partisan views.  It's my understanding that, in general, the republican party resists any sort of government control.  It's also my understanding that most christians are affiliated with the republican party.  I may be off my rocker here, but why would these same groups want to promote any sort of gov't regulation in the schools (i.e., prayer in public schools).  It leads me to believe that they generally resist gov't control and/or gov't programs, except when it's to their benefit.  I hope this post makes some sense.  I recognize that I may be mistaken about some of this; but I have to keep it short, as I can't spend all day trying to sort something like this out.  Gotta get back to my schoolwork ASAP!!!
A quick morning post here...  Last day of Orientation today, and only a half day!!  :) I was thinking about taking a book or two to the beach afterwards, but I don't think the weather will support that idea.  Oh well.  I'll get more accomplished if I stay inside anyway.  I was reading an interesting article in the local paper -- it's about "school vouchers."  Just more evidence that the education system, especially in terms of policy, will be everchanging and always interesting.  More on that later...  Mom/Sister -- Thanks so much for knowing what's best for me in terms of the cable/high-speed internet!  I'm really using it a lot and I know that all the legal research I have ahead of me will make it more than worthwhile.  Love you guys, and miss you dearly!  XOXOX
Off to Orientation Day 2, along with 33.3% of my freaky fellow 1Ls.  I mean that in the nicest of ways.  It's actually a very large class.  It's hard to imagine that my Orientation group times three is even gonna FIT in that school! I'll try to get more rest tonight, mainly so this weblog doesn't get too stupid and rambly.  That tends to happen when I'm overtired.  A good workout (already got that overwith, yay!) and this coffee will definitely make the day easier. I hope everyone at home is doing well!  XOXOX
I mentioned needing to get some sleep in my last post.  I tried to sleep, but it just wasn't in the cards.  So, I commented on the comments (see below) and now I just have 45 minutes to kill until the gym opens.  Then, I'll probably be drowning myself in coffee all day so I can stay awake. Why couldn't I sleep?  I dunno.  Maybe I'm more anxious than I would like to admit, but trust me, I won't admit that again after this.  Just not my style to show nerves, I guess. Or maybe the law school reading just has me sooooo excited I c
