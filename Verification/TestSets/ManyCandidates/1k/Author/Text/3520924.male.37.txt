Also from PW Daily, an interesting & sad note from the world of bookstores...  After 34 Years, A Sad Ending For Ruminator  For 34 years David Unowsky has attended to the complicated business of running an independent bookstore. There were the happy tasks--hosting authors, handselling literary gems, serving a community of passionate readers--that came with owning one of the best-loved bookstores in the country. And, more and more over the past few years, there were the not-so-happy tasks--hunting for funding, watching the debts pile up, scrapping for ways to stay solvent--that came with owning a failing business.  But Unowsky's life has suddenly gotten simpler. "I'm looking for a job," he said. "Someone might hire me to manage a bookstore. I have 34 years of experience."  At the end of next month, Unowsky, 62, will permanently close the doors on his store, Ruminator Books in St. Paul, Minn. He has no choice. On Friday, his landlord and neighbor, Macalester College--to which he owes more than $500,000--served him with an eviction notice. This final blow came after he spent his retirement savings, mortgaged his house and piled up a $100,000 balance on his credit card to keep the store going. Personally on the hook for some of the more than $1 million the store owes to creditors, Unowsky plans to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. He is not just out of business; he is broke.  It is a sad end to an entrepreneurial career that began in 1970, when Unowsky opened the store under the name, Hungry Mind (he sold the name in 2000 and renamed his store). Hungry Mind earned a reputation as one of the few truly fine bookstores in the U.S., often mentioned alongside such greats as City Lights in San Francisco, Elliott Bay in Seattle and Tattered Cover in Denver.  Unowsky admitted that, like many independent booksellers, he's always been more focused on books than profit. But he traced the financial problems that led to the store's closing back to his decision four years ago to open a second store in Minneapolis. In hindsight, he said, he realizes the location was too isolated to sustain a bookstore. The store lost money for three years until it closed.  Struggling with debt, Unowsky fell behind on his payments to Macalester. Her tried a number of tactics to get back on course. Late last year he sold stock in his company, $1 a share for a minimum of 250 shares. He got enough takers to affirm how much book lovers treasure his store--but not enough to cover his debts. He abandoned the stock idea and gave the investors their money back.  Around the same time, he got help from some prominent authors, including Neil Gaiman, Oliver Sacks and Margaret Atwood, who donated items to be auctioned off on eBay to raise money for the store. Then, the horizon seemed to brighten considerably when a financial backer stepped up to negotiate directly with the school.  Those discussions dragged on for months, ending last week with the school demanding that Ruminator Books leave the property. "I'm evicted," the bookseller said. "This isn't my decision. I thought we had a deal with the college and we were going to go forward."  But David Wheaton, Macalester's vice president and treasurer, said they were never able to come to an agreement on future terms or dealing with the store's past debt. "We had gone on for a long time and had been looking for a way to bring the discussions to a decision," he said.  "I think that the store's been an important part of the campus community and the larger literary community for a long time," Wheaton added. "This is not something that we approached or did lightly, and I think it will be a loss for our campus and the neighborhood."  He's not the only one who thinks so. News of Ruminator's imminent demise has provoked the usual laments from writers and readers, who laud the store as a literary oasis in an increasingly shallow and commercial culture. Unowsky must be warmed by such praise. What he really needs now, though, is a steady paycheck.  "I'm 62 years old," he said. "I'd be happy to work for someone else--to work hard for someone else--and go home at night and not worry about making payroll."--Karen Holt
Here's the word on Harry Potter number six from Publisher's Weekly---You can get a 30 day free subscription to their PW Daily for Booksellers and othe electronic newsletters...  Harry Potter and the Next Book Title  It's been one year since Potterphiles devoured Book Five, and no doubt devoted fans have already seen the third and most recent film, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, released earlier this month, multiple times. So with a long summer holiday underway, people are wondering--what's next?  Today fans got a taste. J.K. Rowling has revealed via her Web site that the title of Book Six is Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince. She has already noted that neither Harry nor Lord Voldemort is the half-blood prince of the title.  Rowling relaunched her site earlier this year to give herself a place to dispel the many Harry rumors and to update fans about her writing. She planted hints about the sixth title there, but a hoaxer simultaneously posted information on a fan site that offered up a different, false, title.  For those keeping track, Rowling said she is making progress on Half Blood, though she is not finished and no publication date has been announced. In the meantime, fans will have to make due with the paperback of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, to be released by Scholastic on August 10, and the knowledge that production for the fourth film--expected in November 2005--is underway.--Shannon Maughan
I know it's been a while since I posted anything new so I thought I'd write a short update on why.   I've been immersed in about 5 books simultaneously, two of which I should wrap very shortly. For the curious, the books are:   --Adam of the Road, a
