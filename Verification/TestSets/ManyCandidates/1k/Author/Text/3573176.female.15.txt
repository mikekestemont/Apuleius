Beyonce- Daddy  I remember when you use to take me on a  Bike ride everyday on the bayou (you remember that? we were inseparable)  And I remember when you could do no wrong  You'd come home from work and I jumped in your arms when I saw you  I was so happy to see you (I was so excited, so happy to see you)   Because you loved me I overcome  And I'm so proud of what you've become  You've given me such security  No matter what mistakes I make you're there for me  You kill my disappointments and you heal my pain  You understood my fears and you protected me  Treasure every irreplaceable memory and that's why?br>  I want my unborn son to be like my daddy  I want my husband to be like my daddy  There is no one else like my daddy  And I thank you for loving me   I still remember the expression on your face  When you found out I'd been on a date and had a boyfriend (my first boyfriend, you should have seen your face)  I still remember I caught you crying cause of my tattoo  Could have said beyonce I told you so  Instead you said you'd get one too (even my mama said y'all get one just like mine)   Words can't express my boundless gratitude for you  I appreciate what you do  You've given me such security  No matter what mistakes I make you're there for me  You kill my disappointments and you heal my pain  You understand my fears and you protected me  Treasure every extraordinary memory and that's why?br>  I want my unborn son to be like my daddy  I want my husband to be like my daddy  There is no one else like my daddy  And I thank you for loving me   Even if my man broke my heart today  No matter how much pain I'm in I will be okay  Cause I got a man in my life that can't be replaced  For this love is unconditional it won't go away  I know I'm lucky  Know it ain't easy  For men who take care of their responsibilities  Love is overwhelming  Can't help my tears from falling  I love you so much daddy   (Thank you, you've done so much for me. I love you daddy.)   I get so emotional daddy, every time I think of you  I get so emotional daddy, every time I think of you  There is no one else like my daddy  No one else replace my daddy...
