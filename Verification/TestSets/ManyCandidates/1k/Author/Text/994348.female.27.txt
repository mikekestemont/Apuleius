POX OFF!   I was missed by Claudia for days, and Marwan has been nagging me for avoiding her like a plague. Well, how can you blame me when I have not been contracted with chicken pox before, and her sons are having the yuckish pox. Man, it's highly contagious when the carrier gets close to anyone who has not contracted it before, and that, unfortunately, is me.  Come to think of it, I have successfully avoided her for a week: giving excuses for not meeting her for lunch by doing installations, doing OT, and many more. But today I have no more to be excused. She messaged me at 2pm exact and asked to meet. Luckily, when I arrived she was with Yanti and the distance between us are a long table apart. I thought I must be safe and even laughed inside when we were about to go off. BUT she dragged me back to our main office and pushed a present towards me. "Happy belated birthday! I wanted to give it to you since last week but you were busy." OOPS. Thousands of emotions filled my guilty mind and wormhole heart. You couldn't imagine how I stood there, with an expression that she couldn't comprehend at all. All I could muster out was a feeble, "Thanks..." With a childish smile she urged me to open the small and compact wrapped gift. (she even made a ribbon to go with it!) It was a nice gift indeed, something that I had mentioned ages ago and she has the heart to remember it. Then she leaned forward (towards me), and told me about some office gossips that she had collected during the past week. There I was, starting to panic, whether the disease will start spreading, going in slowly to my ears, eyes, mouth and nostrils! But what could I do? I was frozen (partly due to the guilt and due to the fact that I had nowhere to move in her cubicle) right there...all I did was to give some responses to her banter. Finally, thanks to a delivery man, I managed to 'escape'. PHEW.  Well she's really an angel... being so nice... so unassuming towards her overly-suspicisous and selfish friend. I ought to be slapped and kicked. I guess the ultimate punishment for mistreating my dear friend would be contracting the virus itself! ARGH!!!  (uh-oh... i'm feeling itchy all over.. pls assure me it's juz my paranoia....)
THE OTHER     A man runs into an old friend who had somehow never been able to make it in life. "I should give him some money," he thinks. But instead he learns that his old friend has grown rich and is actually seeking him out to repay the debts he had run up over the years.  They go to a bar they used to frequent together, and the friend buys drinks for everyone there. When they ask him how he became so successful, he answers that only until a few days ago, he had been living the role of the "Other."  "What is the Other?" they ask.  "The Other is the one who taught me what I should be like, but not what I am. The Other believes that it is our obligation to spend our entire life thinking about how to get our hands on as much money as possible so that we will not die of hunger when we are old. So we think so much about money and our plans for acquiring it that we discover we are alive only when our days on earth are practically done. And then it's too late."  "And you? Who are you?"  "I am just like everyone else who listens to their heart: a person who is enchanted by the mystery of life. Who is open to miracles, who experiences joy and enthusiasm for what they do. It's just that the Other, afraid of disappointment, kept me from taking action."  "But there is suffering in life," one of the listeners said.  "And there are defeats. No one can avoid them. But it's better to lose some of the battles in your struggle for your dreams than to be defeated without ever even knowing what you're fighting for."  "That's it?" another listener asked.  "Yes, that's it. When I learned this, I resolved to become the person I had always wanted to be. The Other stood there in the corner of my room, watching me, but I will never let the Other into myself again - even though it has already tried to frighten me, warning me it's risky not to think about the future.  "From the moment I ousted the Other from my life, the Divine Energy began to perform its miracles."   * By The River Piedra I Sat Down And Wept - Paulo COELHO
STATE OF CHAOS    Question: "What's the difference between a pregnant lady and a lightbulb?"  Answer: "You can't unscrew the pregnant lady."   Funny? To me, it is. Been trying to cheer myself up for the past two weeks. I dunno if it's the damned pills that make me like that but I would like to think so. The only good thing about these pills are that they really stop my menses but they play around with my moods. Thank goodness I have it under control since monday and have been feeling pleasant and totally myself again... till an hour ago. My emotions just went thru a tough rollercoaster ride. You see, I couldn't contain myself any longer so I msged Cliff about our status.&nbsp;That's when the ride started. It wasn't a good conversation because it didn't resolve anything and worse, I got to know he has so much hatred and negativity about me. Why? Because of the past messages I sent, hurt him deep and hard. I swear, I wasn't even cursing, scolding nor hurling abuses at him. I was only telling him how I felt and was trying to confirm my thoughts. Like I told him just now, if I can't be frank, honest and open to him, what would I
