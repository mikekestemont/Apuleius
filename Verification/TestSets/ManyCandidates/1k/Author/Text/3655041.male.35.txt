If you hate politics, skip the next paragraph.   The election is over.  A couple months of campaigning, one day of elections, and we know who our Prime Minister is.  Take that U.S.A.!  Canada rules!  or does it?  I keep hearing the same thing over and over again.  I don't like the Liberal leader, but i like their local candidate.  I want Paul Martin to win, but i don't want to vote for the local Liberal... and on and on and on.  So we need to change the system.  I believe we need to cast a vote directly for our country's leader.  Anyways, they all look the same to me.  I'll put them with the other 'Leader' beans...  Alright, enough about the election.  It's over for 5 more years.    Yesterday i was in the library looking for a book.  I couldn't find the latest Harry Potter adventure.  So i walked out of there with a copy of  Lady Chatterly's Lover  by  D.H. Lawrence .  How's that for a stretch?  I read the first two chapters last night and it seems excellent, once you can figure out the early 20th century english.  I saw two squirrels chasing each other around a tree trunk the other day.  Or was it one squirrel running really fast.  And if it was only one squirrel, did  he  know that?  Things that make you go hmmmmm.  I have a new poll on my blog.  I had no idea what to make the poll about, just that i wanted one on my site ~ so i took the impending Canada Day theme and made it somewhat patriotic.  Make sure you click on the poll before you leave the page!  If you have any ideas for another poll hit me up with it and i'll do it later.   Hell, i dont have anything better to do, hehe.   Predictions... yes.  This year the New York Yankees will make the baseball playoffs.  I realize i'm going way out on a limb here with this one.   Mmmmm money, is there anything it can't do?!?   Well, i'm bored, and even though there are a billion little blurbs i could type here, i need a smoke.  I outta here ~Sizobonana
Hey i've been away from the 'puter for a few days, but i'm back for a couple of minutes to update everyone on what has been happening in my life the past few days!   nothing   Well now that has been taken care of.  But seriously, it's a fuckin' beautiful day here in Moncton.  I imagine it's about 22 degrees out there, and blue sky.  Finally.  Hope everyone enjoys the two weeks of summer we have here beside the chocolate river.  Have you ever looked out at the banks of Hall's Creek and imagined that cracked slimy muck to be chocolate?  If you have no life like i do, then of course you have!  I don't know if it will come across in print, but i am in an unusual mood today.  Bored, yet excited.  Happy, yet pensive.  Sober, yet... well i  am  sober, so that's too bad.   I actually expect to hear back from ExxonMobil this week so this weekend i may be a little inebriated from celebrating!   I finally finished reading  The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla .  I started in on  The Talisman , but found it to be slow pacing in the first 25 pages, so i may venture downstairs  (I'm at the library right now)  and pick up something else to read.  Venturing into the children's section to locate the fifth installment of the Harry Potter adventures should sufficiently make me feel uneasy, not to mention creep out half of the children there.  I have to run over to  Krystal Blade Tattoos  and get an estimate on retouching my tattoo.  When i finally get my own computer i'll be able to post more photos on here, and this would have been an excellent spot to showcase my inkwork, but i suck and have no computer.  So just use your imagination if you haven't seen it.  It's a black sillouetted image of a girl, on her knees, back showing, head bent down in a cascade of jet black hair, and wrists tied with rope behind her back.  Seriously though, i'm just kidding.  What kind of a masochist would have something like that permanently inked on their arm?!? It's not rope, it's handcuffs.  Well all I would like to thank everyone for their comments, especially to Roy for including my blog addy on his blog   http://roymacho.blogspot.com/  , and to the anonymous comment from someone... hmmm... if i had a motorgoat for everytime i have heard that one.  Election Day in Canada.  I think i'll get over to vote in a couple hours, although in all honesty i haven't really decided who to vote for.  There isn't much to pick from in 2004. The Americans usually have better election campaigns.* ~Do svidanja  * personally i'm anti-bush.  meow.  nothing?!?  inside joke.
