I don't really enjoy writing, so on the off chance someone is viewing this, imagine that my prose would be good enough to make Shakespeare's ears bleed in jealousy. Or go read something good and pretend its me.
I'm only posting today because I won't be able to do it for four more years. A great swell of pity goes out for the diseased vermin/children brought kicking and screaming into the world today. It's sad to think that you will never make past the age of thirty. Sucks to be you.  Also, I am posting because I should be rewriting my term paper, but you know what? Fuck that. Fuck that fucking shit up its fucking unformed ass. Actually scratch that. I will not go down in a flame of stupidity along with all the other drama queens. Who cares that I have spent this entire weekend working on that damned musical? Or that I have skipped lunch for the past week to work on it? HOLD IT! What did I say about being a whiny drama queen? So stop it! Anyways, I've joined the glamorous circles of playboy, people, and the bible for crapper reading, so I must rise above! I will say this though; If I didn't admire and aspire to be a Romantic and/or Byronic Hero so much, I would have killed every last person in this damned show.  Some of the people are cool I guess. The only reason I don't gush is that I don't want to add fodder for the people (like me) who simply read blogs to find out what the author thinks about others. Us gossip whores are stinkers, ain't we?  Yep, that about wraps it up I guess.   Wow, Lord of the Rings won ten or eleven oscars. Huh. I guess people weren't lying when they said New Zealand was a real country. Guess I should write a paper.
SwongaDamnit: [blank] told me something interesting stillmoigw: ... SwongaDamnit: apparently he was in on a game of Fuck-Marry-Kill with all the cool girls and people SwongaDamnit: and my name came up stillmoigw: what's that? stillmoigw: i would fuck/marry/kill stillmoigw: him? SwongaDamnit: Thats when you say a name to the opposite sex and thery pick a choice SwongaDamnit: apparently nearly all the girls said "marry" in reaction to me - cause I'm so nice and funny SwongaDamnit: no fucks SwongaDamnit: probably at least one kill stillmoigw: i thought marry would include fuck SwongaDamnit: nah stillmoigw: oh stillmoigw: ok stillmoigw: you would be an emotional tampon stillmoigw: that they would use 4 days a month stillmoigw: and then throw away  Still sounds better than what I get now, though I admit WPA was alot of fun.
Why must my e-mail mock me with all of its penis growth ads? Do I not feel enough shame every time I look down in the shower? Damn you, you purveyors of broken dreams!  I've been suffering from increasing amounts of anger fits lately - you know those times when you can feel the bile bubble up in the back of your throat, scalding and scarring your vocal cords with pure, unrelenting hatred. Funny thing is though, there's not focus. No one single person, place, or thing other than the musical is really upsetting me. All it is is simply remembering my past failures, and BOOM! I must be really fucking insecure. That sucks. Oh well, made up disorders are better than real ones, I suppose.    I SUPPOSE? What the fuck is that? Thats the problem! INSECURITY my friend. You can't fucking suppose, you got to fucking KNOW. I KNOW this or I KNOW that. You don't fucking suppose things! You need to seize life, and tackle it to the floor, and fucking pistol whip it. And while its down, you need to kick it in the side, flip it over, and piss all over its back. That should teach life a thing or two. You can't fucking do that while you're busy supposing. You got to be knowing! You got to be decisive! You can't even fucking decide where to eat! If someone asks you where to eat, you can be all fucking "I don't care" or "I don't know, what do you want?" You got to be all fucking "We ARE going to Chipotle right now and we are going to fucking like it." You need to apply the fucking willpower to all your hopes and dreams too. What the fuck do you get by dreaming and hoping? Jack fucking squat. You need to go out there and do shit. Don't keep saying you're going to do a fucking independent study or write and article for a voice. You NEED to write that mother-fuckin article right here and now? Are you gonna let Beecher do it instead? I better fucking hope not, you sad sack of shit! So, from now on, I order you to be decisive!   Ok.   WHAT DID YOU SAY?   Yes Sir!   I CAN'T HEAR YOU!   SIR, YES SIR!   Good, now hit the showers and go to bed, cause you may be the craziest goddamned boy I've ever seen.
Bwahahahahaha!   urlLink How do I love you? Let me Snort a line.   Score one for the people who always knew love was like being a coke head! Now I can make fun of all the people whom I was jealous of, as their filthy fucking addicts. Losers!   Yeah, so the musical fucking sucks. Watching a bunch of monkeys dance around stage is bad enough. Teaching a bunch of monkeys to act while dance is simply hellish.  Staying until 8:30 PM to watch said teaching can only be equated to having a rabid male porcupine in heat shoved up my urethra, while simultaneously having pure, concentrated stupidty injected into my oxygen deprived brain. In other words - it ain't fun. The coming monday will prove to be one of the most painful in recent memory. Oh well, it will come, be over, and then I will eventually die. Hopefully I'll lose my virginity in between t
