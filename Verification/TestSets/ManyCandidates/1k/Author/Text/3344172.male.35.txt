To my friends, family, enemies, and the occasional dust bunny..listen up..  Well..those who know me realize that I do not always do things by the book..in some instances I run over, eat or otherwise destroy the book. (I have not figured out if that is a good or bad thing)..therefore I have (yet again) another opportunity that I want to take advantage of (for my own sanity…maybe)  My past experiences have allowed me to see and experience some wonderful things but what really means a lot to me is being able to share them with those I care about (whether you want to hear it or not).  Four years ago I drove across the country from Hollywood, Florida to Hollywood, CA (hey I wasn't doing anything constructive)..the result...5000 miles on a co-worker's daughter's car..couple of speeding tickets..and some incredible sights and experiences in places called the "Loaf and Jug"...in other words a success.  Two years ago..it was biking across the awesome country of Ireland (where else is someone nicknamed "Beerman" supposed to go)..the result..drinking my weight in the lovely black stuff they called stout..the result once again was a success  Now for the latest...I have been given an opportunity to pursue a dream of sort by combining the above two. I have been hired as a tour router for a company called CycleAmerica. Starting on June 8th, I will be flying to MN to meet with the staff and then make our way out to Seattle for the start of the tour on June 19. I will be working as a tour router and participating on a cross country bicycle tour from Seattle, Washington to Boston, MA. I will be finishing in Boston on or around August 21 and then be there for about a week seeing family and friends in the area. (Come on up...the beer's cold) I will be following the northern route of the US and into parts of Ontario Canada. I am very excited about this opportunity and hope to come back with a new attitude, wonderful experiences and some sore legs and an ass to match. The trip is a total of 63 days covering about 4200 miles through 13 states and parts of Canada. (After this..I think I will hang up my shoes for a while and practice staying on a couch)  I am experimenting with some options on keeping in touch with everyone and hopefully will do this with email but am trying a service called “blogger” which basically means postings that I can upload pics, notes, and other dirty incriminating stuff throughout my journey. You can access this via my website at www.scottkatzer.com  (there’s nothing on it so don’t get too excited) and hit the link labeled “I power Blogger”. This should take you directly to my site where you can read emails from the road. The other link on my personal web page (cycleamerica) has my actual tour route (or you can get it from the website www.cycleamerica.com) I am hoping to have pictures uploaded from each part of the trip so you can click on the part of the tour and see the pictures from that part of the trip..we’ll see how it works.  You can reply and post your emails to the blogger site as well by clicking the link at the bottom of the blog page (who thinks up these names anyway) Hopefully this works..otherwise just watch the news every once in a while and perhaps you'll see me get chased down by a moose or something. I figure this will make people happy because I get to “think” I have an audience and those who want to read it can..and those that don’t …well screw you too…just kidding. You can always email me at either Skatzer@ssr-inc.com or scott@scottkatzer.com. Hopefully there will be a tree somewhere that I can plug into. I’d love to hear from you and see what the rest of the world is doing.  My company has been great thru all this and has allowed me to keep my cell phone throughout all this (which means that they can contact me for work...hmmm)..anyway I can hopefully still be reached at 954-649-9109 should you want to call and say hi or will be in the area. Just keep in mind that I will be bicycling through towns where some of the folk may respond “A cell what now?” So…I can’t promise that the signal strength will be the greatest but at the very least I’ll have a way to retrieve messages. My last day in the office will be on Friday June 4th (and the &^%$* hitting the fan starting on June 5th)  I'll keep everyone posted before the start on what else is up. Looking forward to your smart ass comments and will talk to everyone soon. Apologize for the long email but since I am long winded..I figure it will be OK.
OK...wouldn't you know it..years and yesrs of travelling for business has led me to concur that I and only I will get stopped, probed (without having dinner bought for me), wanded, patted down, and sometimes even treated fairly so I actually get up really early (yes..5am is really early) to assure that as I am bringing half of my life with me..I will have enough time for this wonderful industry we call airlines. Sure enough...everything is going too smoothly. I check-in in just about 10 minutes...too scary. Of course there is some guy on the ground crew doing circles on a bike (that looks similar to mine..hmm) right now on runway 9A...might slow things up a bit  Right now I have about an hour till my flight and thought I would partake in the Crown Room one last time...even 7am is too early for me for a beer (oh man...what am I saying??) There is another staff member who is also on my flight..funny how this cross country tour is filled with people from all over America and the other tour router is from Hallandale. Good guy named Keith..about 40 something...last we talked..he h
