Welcome to the flagship blogging madness of "Three Girls Grown Up".  We are three "former college girls" who have been friends for... eons, I guess.  We made it through school (well some of us did, some of us are STILL IN SCHOOL) and are navigating/fumbling our way through life as adults.  We miss the days of sitting around curled up on the couch babbling until all ours, hands cupped around hot tea, cocoa or whatever.  Long days sitting in the porch swing, road trips, truth-or-dare, just being together and basically just BEING.  This is our way of doing that despite being scattered to the four winds.  Thanks for joining us!
Those five years were fabulous.  I love the learning experience (miss it immensely!) and the good company.  Majoring in art was incredibly difficult.  I am artistic, but not a natural drawing/painting talent.  It was frustrating to sit next to people who could put a single line on paper and it looked like art.  I agonized over every line and stroke.  I didn't know what I was doing and even though I waited four years to go to college I still didn't know what I should be doing.  And actually, I'm not entirely sure I know now.  Love was in my blood in college.  Falling "in love" with the fellas, with the books, with learning, with art.  Loving life and the thought of the world being open to me.  Very heady stuff.  In some ways those years were also agonizing, having self-doubt, wanting to change majors sometimes, the stress of the workload and working to support myself.  Horrible professors at times.  The boring classes that had nothing to do with anything I wanted to do.  Depression at not being as good as I thought I could be.  I applied for the specialized degree program and was accepted after my work was juried by the professors in my department.  There were three of us that applied at the same time.  Two made it.  I overheard the last girl being rejected and felt horrible and relieved at the same time.  The acceptance created an additional year for me to stay in school.  I never felt like an artist, though, and worried that someone would discover I was not.  After going through some delightful boys and some not-so-delightful boys I settled on one, graduated and went to work as a designer for a gift company.  I designed stationery and apparel for a couple of years then had a brief break with reality at which time I decided to break all my ties and run away to California.  There I worked with computers doing freelance researching, writing, web design, project managing.  Basically a mercenery brain-for-hire.  I loved those years as well despite the hard knocks I got for it.  I remember telling someone (probably Shannon) before I left that it might be a mistake but I was doing it anyway because it would turn out okay in the long run.  I do that a lot.  For a very long time I was involved with someone defective and brilliant who is an excellent example of walking that fine line between genius and insanity.  Depending on how well you know him is where you think he is on that line.  The more I knew him the farther he seemed to stray over into the foggy shadows of craziness.  And we'll leave it at that (and hope everyone else leaves it at that too).  But the California years were more GOOD than bad and, again, an invaluable learning experience.  With that came self-sufficiency, a love for self-employment, discovering so many strengths I didn't know I had.  I'm psyched to run my own business and be good at it.  California is a beautiful state and I'm so fortunate to have my time there.  I met my husband there and we married after knowing each other a couple of years and finally after his stressful job became too much and we got tired of the high cost of living out there (and the rolling blackouts), we thought how cool it would be to play frontier family and move back to my home state of Arkansas.  We're in the process of taking over the family business here.  For half of what we were paying in California, we can afford to own a home AND six acres of lakefront property where we plan to build eventually.  But it's a strange, circuitous route from starting here, going there, having all these different jobs, coming back here and ending up in real estate which is something I never had a desire to do.  Oddly enough I found out I'm good at it, so it turned out just fine.  AND, we have little munchkin added to the family, a sweet angel boy that couldn't be more perfect if I'd sat down and made a wishlist to have him created from scratch.  Someone joked about how he needed a sister and I thought... there's no way I can top that.  No way in the world.  I think it was probably my junior year in college Ginny gave me a copy of the Tao te Ching, a very good translation by Stephen Mitchell (which I still have, Ginny).  I was tense and controlling and making not only myself miserable but probably everyone around me feel pretty much the same way.  The best message I got out of that book was about letting go.  When I let go and stopped trying to make things always be exactly as I thought they should... those were the moments when things worked the absolute best way they could.  It was like magic.  I don't understand the how or why of it, but it's one of the best lessons I learned.  So, I try not to fret excessively.  It's like natural prozac or something -- free, and it also doesn't mess up your health insurance coverage.  This morning my mom asked me how I was going to manage my next big hurdle, and I told her I wasn't sure, but I'd figure it o
