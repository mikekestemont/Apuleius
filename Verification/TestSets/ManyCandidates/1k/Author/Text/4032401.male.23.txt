Well I headlined at Rooster T Feathers Comedy Club in Sunnyvale, CA.  For those who don't know about Rooster's, it's a very nice club in Silicon Valley that caters to the Silicon Valley type, ie white and Indian.  This is perhaps one of the hardest clubs I've ever performed at.  For some reason, I do decent to well there, however, I don't KILL.  I hate not being able to KILL at a place.  And I can't figure the audience out.  They will laugh at stupid stuff and other comedians who are ok, but when I go up there they act like I'm going to rob them.  I don't want to call the audience stupid, but they should know that I would only rob them in the parking lot, not in the actual club where I'm trying to get work at.   I hate not being able to figure an audience out.  Usually you can feel them out and know if they want clean, dirty, political, sexual, racial, etc type of humor.  Well I decided that since it was a white audience to try and be clean with as little sexual humor and cussing as possible.  Other comedians before me did well and were alot more dirty than I was.  So I'm on stage and my first bit, which is one of my very best bits because it always does well, it's like one of my aces in my deck of cards, well it doesn't do very well.  I tend to tell stories that unfold and have punchlines throughout.  This place decides to wait till the very last punchline before deciding whether they will laugh or stare at you and make you feel like kicking them.  This is hard when you do long bits, because you rely on the laughter to build up to the end and keep momentum going.  Silence is not a very good confidence booster on stage.  Luckily, I get them going pretty well with my college material, weight bits, and disney and internet gangs.  The racial jokes for the most part do well, except for when I do a bit referring to white people being more likely to have incest, which I totally understand.  I do it more for my benefit then theirs.   What sucks the most is that I don't think the owner of the club stayed for any if not the first few minutes of my set.  I did this set in order for her to see me perform live and decide whether to book me or not.  If she only saw my bomb the first joke, then I'm done there.  I didn't see her after my set so I went home with my tail inbetween my legs (I have a really long butt).  I figure if she emails me and wants to book me then cool, and if not, then oh well.  This club's crowd may not be the crowd for me.  They seem to enjoy more of the, how should I put it, "White" comedians like Gary Shandling.  I think the only non-white comedian picture they had on the wall was Margeret Cho.   So I bid farewell to Rooster T Feathers and it's cracker-fest.  I guess I'll stick to the clubs that have that certain element I like to call minorities.  Actually, what gets me is that I usually do very well in front of white people.  Its just THESE white people who get don't get me :(  Maybe I should write more puns and analogy's for jokes so they can be pleased.  Actually I think I'm going to start focusing on my acting more than my comedy.  At least for now while I'm in the bay area.  For comedy I will do showcases to keep fresh and competitions and festivals.  As far as getting booked,  my main booker doesnt seem to want to book me anymore seeing as how I haven't heard from him in 2 months and can't get him to take or return my phone calls or emails.  Oh well, it's his loss...right?  *sniff* Please take me back booker.  Well acting is paying more than comedy ever will right now, so I'm happy as long as I got something good going on.  If you read this, sorry it wasn't very funny, I just felt like venting and I was trying to not cuss in case my mom reads it or something.
Well today I wanted to talk about a couple of things: how my commercial shoot went and how my comedy show went last night.  For some reason, my body likes to mess with me.&nbsp; I think it's self-destructive, because whenever I get a big gig something happens.&nbsp; When I did my PlaysStation 2 commercial, the night before I started to lose my voice.&nbsp; I barely made it through the shoot with the little bit of voice I had.&nbsp; I had that deep, sexy voice, it was sexy except for every 2 minutes when I had to make that ugly clearing your throat noise.&nbsp; So I get booked on Friday for this Battlefront commercial that shoots on Monday.&nbsp; And out of nowhere this gigantic pimple erupts onto the side of my nose.&nbsp; This is my self-destructive body going to work, because I never get pimples on my nose, and never that big.&nbsp; This thing looked like a colony had formed.&nbsp; When I get pimples it's where my facial hair grows as a result of ingrown hairs.&nbsp; So I am freaking out because I can picture myself showing up and they look at my pimple and are like, yeah, we can't use you in the commercial with that thing on your face.&nbsp; But the shoot takes place at this ILM studio which is owned by LucasArts and does the special effects and art for hundreds of movies including Star Wars.&nbsp; So I'm thinking that they can CGI it off my face or make it turn into an ewok or something.&nbsp; Fortunately, this was a big time shoot, so they had a professional make-up artist there who went to work on it and miraculously m
