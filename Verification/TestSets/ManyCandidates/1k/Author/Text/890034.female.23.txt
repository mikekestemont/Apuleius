so it is amazing how oblivious you can be to something when you don't want to see it..... such as friends fading away from you when they find that certian someone that is that much more important than you. amazing, and disturbing how it will take someone else, who potentially could be super close to you if only given the chance, to point it out. fuck me.   p.s. so.... sweetie, i saw you tonight as well.... you said you were getting your drink on, so atleast i dont think you were with your girl...... straight edge health freak.... and youre home now. so do you ever see her? i am hopng you see more of me, and something tells me you do. mmmm so yeah.... and aaron and jeff from 38th parallel....i am super glad i "met" you guys...  now on: the doors: hello, i love you
''Solitude-walking alone, doing things alone - is the most blessed thing in the world. The mind relaxes and thoughts begin to flow and I think that I am beginning to find myself a little.'' Helen Hayes  ... had to get that down while i could....   yep.. and so it goes....
what a hard day...... will i ever make it through college? i feel i strive on stress.... on pressure. i am miserable at the time, yet i feel the most rewarded as successful when i pull through. this is bad, why? because i am sure that the stressed out folks of corporate america feel like this as well.. everyday. and what comes of it? money, which i clearly don't care about, and ulcers.   i swear, everday i have a new epiphany.... something that both opens my eyes and knocks me on my ass. this is amazing for my journey of self discovery and learning, but is hard on me, for i have so muh else i must focus my time and energy on. july is soon approaching. this is the last thanksgiving, christmas, easter i have with my family.......... the last year i have with "my people" here at home. i will have to establish an entire new life out there........ and that will be so hard. job? place? friends? boy? good god..................  p.s. not to fret. my fortune today says this: "someone from your past has returned to steal your heart." are you willing to take it? feels i am willing to give..... it was wonderful to spend time with you today, although we were not alone. maybe this will get our ball moving? all the intillectual/sexual maturity talk had me questioning things..... you accused our pal of having things going on with the girl friend.... saying his girl wouldnt dig. does your girl know? tell me how you feel. are you sneaking around? am i one of the guys? if he cant have a girl friend and hang out with her one on one, can you? are we pushing some boundary i was unaware of? i hope so. i saw you last night..... did you want me to? it was beautiful....... tight and silhouetted....and again after you left. i like what i see................  now on: the cure- just like heaven
soo.... fuck. the more i should do something these days the less likely i am to actually do it. add this to the list of unhealthy patterns, will you? i am my motivations, i have my goals and aspirations, i have the work ethic, but never at the same time. and so it goes.  p.s. i wanted to get ahold of you late last night, but fought the urge, if you will. maybe tomorrow you can head out with me? hopefully we can talk... it gets a bit deeper everyday, don't you think? progression. what a bizarre history.... a long, strange trip, so they say......  now on: bob marley- redemption song
