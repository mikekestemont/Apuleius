Andrew Sullivan has a great quote today from Orwell on biases of intellectual leftists.  The quote comes from Orwell's 1945 "Notes on Nationalism."  The essay also includes the following gem on pacificism:  "The majority of pacifists either belong to obscure religious sects or are simply humanitarians who object to the taking of life and prefer not to follow their thoughts beyond that point. But there is a minority of intellectual pacifists whose real though unadmitted motive appears to be hatred of western democracy and admiration of totalitarianism. Pacifist propaganda usually boils down to saying that one side is as bad as the other, but if one looks closely at the writings of younger intellectual pacifists, one finds that they do not by any means express impartial disapproval but are directed almost entirely against Britain and the United States. Moreover they do not as a rule condemn violence as such, but only violence used in defense of western countries. The Russians, unlike the British, are not blamed for defending themselves by warlike means, and indeed all pacifist propaganda of this type avoids mention of Russia or China. It is not claimed, again, that the Indians should abjure violence in their struggle against the British.  Pacifist literature abounds with equivocal remarks  which, if they mean anything, appear to mean that statesmen of the type of Hitler are preferable to those of the type of Churchill, and that violence is perhaps excusable if it is violent enough. After the fall of France, the French pacifists, faced by a real choice which their English colleagues have not had to make, mostly went over to the Nazis, and in England there appears to have been some small overlap of membership between the Peace Pledge Union and the Blackshirts. Pacifist writers have written in praise of Carlyle, one of the intellectual fathers of Fascism. All in all it is difficult not to feel that pacifism, as it appears among a section of the intelligentsia, is secretly inspired by an admiration for power and successful cruelty. The mistake was made of pinning this emotion to Hitler, but it could easily be retransfered."  I won't go so far to say that opponents of the war, if it came to that, would prefer bin Laden or Saddam Hussein to Bush, but their unwillingness to offer anything more than the most pro forma criticisms of the former suggests a very large moral blindspot.
Following up on my earlier post about the tendency toward conspiracy theories among supporters of political Islam, according to the BBC, Islamic clerics in Nigeria are opposing a WHO polio vaccination campaign.  This is based on rumors that "have been circulating in northern Nigeria  that the vaccine is part of a US plot to limit the country's population by spreading Aids and rendering people infertile. "
Today's NYT Week in Review has a page 1 story about the rise of political Islam.  This movement casts itself as the primary alternative to Western liberal democracy and capitalism.  Furthermore, as the story points out, even its most moderate adherents are prone to accept the most outrageous anti-American and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.  On the follow page, there is also a story about the recent report from Arab social scientists claiming that the Arab world is "failing to educate its  people, offer them basic freedoms, encourage individual enterprise or support women's rights."  Indeed, they quote from the report that "Knowledge in Arab countries today appears to be on the retreat."    It seems to me that these two stories are really one.  The lack of education, economic opportunity, and democratic values (especially for women) seems to be the real cause for the rise of political Islam.  Yet the Times story suggest that it US actions regarding Afghanistan, Iraq, and Israel are the most important factors behind its recent spread.  I don't deny that US policies have surely provoked political Islams adherents, but this seems unavoidable, given that they oppose not just to specific American policies, but the basic human values that the US and other Western nations espouse.
I just watched some of the D.C. anti-war demonstration on C-SPAN.  Just how big was that crowd?  Some media accounts put it at tens of thousands, but I'd guess maybe 4-5000, tops.  Also, I didn't catch her whole speech, but I was struck by the mother of the Marine who wanted to get out because he was opposed to war.  If so, then why in God's name did he join the Marines?
The NYT reports today that Charles Murray, the Josiah Nott of contemporary social science, is back at it.  It seems that Murray has set out to prove empirically that the West, especially Euro-Americans, are more accomplished than any other civilization.  I'm not a cultural relativist, but this seems a silly excercise.  First, judging civilizations on the basis of standards of accomplishment that are in large part a product of one civilization seems to tilt the playing field.  Also, Murray himself points to the biggest flaw in such a comparison.  According to the article:  "As for the near total absence of women — they represent a mere 2 percent of     the inventories — the reason is clear, Mr. Murray writes. Until the 19th century, laws and social convention severely restricted their vocational pursuits."  But why shouldn't the same logic be applied to non-western peoples?  Colonialism and other forms of domination surely limited the attainments of many.  Perhaps the demise of colonialism is the reason why Murray believes that the West is losing its superiority in the areas he catalogs.
Well, I've decided to take the leap and start a blog.  I suppose that this is the pinnacle of hubris and ego--thinking that anyone might care about my thoughts and observations on things.  On the other hand, what makes the Safires, Krugmans, Wills, and Dowds of this world so important?    --Did anyone see the story about lightning striking the set of Mel Gibson's move about the passion of Christ?  For the second time!!??  I'm an empirical social scientist, so I'll let one strike slide as coincidence, but not two.  W
