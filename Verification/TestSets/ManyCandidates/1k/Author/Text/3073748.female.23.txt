We just caught an Eighties Band Reunion programme on VH1. Flock Of Seagulls were the featured band. They were all completely bald.

I was hoping this would still be up. Check out Dr Miriam Stoppard's advice to a girl worried about the size of her boy's appendage...I think she forgot to add, "but you might not be as shallow" as a coda...   SHOCKED AT SHORT MEASURE    Dear Miriam,    I'D been with my boyfriend for four months and never felt his erection when we kissed and cuddled.  The other day we went further. We didn't have sex but pleasured each other, and I was shocked his penis was only about four inches long when erect.  It seemed so small it made me feel ill.  I really love my boyfriend but don't think he'll be able to satisfy me. Do you think it's best to leave?  Miriam replies,   YOUR story reminds me of one of Samantha's Sex And The City lovers. It was a cruel, sad and very funny episode.  Samantha and her boyfriend, handsome as Apollo, are getting really hot with each other until Samantha breathlessly pleads for him to put it in, and back comes his answer "it is in".  Samantha's face is a picture of disappointment, pain, confusion, desperation and, when she recounts her story to her three friends, she asks the same question as you. "How can I stay with a man whose penis I can't feel?"  And, if it helps to remind you, Samantha - after a few more attempts at satisfaction - leaves.
We went to the pub this lunchtime. Crazy Lisa the Dutch girl had one too many tinctures and said/did the following (very loudly/noticeably):  1) [Bartender hands her glass of white wine - bear in mind her usual tipple is whisky and beer] "Look at meeeeeee! I'm TARTYYYYYYYYY!!"  2) "I'm going to be absolutely FUCKED!"  3) "I love 'Allo 'Allo with that funny English slag!!"  4) [Does a Madonna dance in the middle of the pub] "Who AM I?? Who am I?!"      Stuart: "Madonna?"     Lisa: "NOOOOOO. I'm Michael Flatley!! LORD OF THE RIIIINGS!!"
I've wiped out my blogging past in one deft swoop of revisionism. Here is my new blogspot. I hope you'll join me in my continuing quest for mediocrity.
I'm really frightened of Michael Jackson. If I were a, say, seven-year old child in the early stages of discovering Michael Jackon's existence, I'd be Jackson-phobic. His mash-up mugshot would represent pure terror.
Is there a better way to spend a Friday morning than eating cake and listening to Lee Perry? Yeah, probably.
Well, I did the interview and met my "new colleagues" (if you can call them that - I haven't got the job yet). The girl is the same age as me, with the same degree (except from Middlesex University) and she's been working for EMI since she left uni! I must be the least ambitious person in the universe.
urlLink I've seen some rubbish in my time, but this takes the biscuit...
Okay, so...I've got my 'Second Interview' tomorrow morning at 9am. This means that I could be working for EMI Classics the week after next!!!!! Part of me wants to go in and wax lyrical about The Best Of Bach, but it's head of royalties I'll be speaking to, so he might be sense of humour: negative.
Me and Pato saw Elijah Wood in Fopp the other week. He was throwing lots of stuff (books, CDs, DVDs) into a basket - he didn't seem particularly fussed about what he bought - I get the impression he was trying to impress us (the general public) by being a conspicuous consumer.
Of course none of us are doing any work because my Day Today DVD just arrived. Of course we're watching Ouzi Lover, instead.
Stuart, Chris and I spent yesterday evening beating the locals into submission in a really easy pub quiz. We had to smuggle ourselves out when the results were announced, as the atmosphere had begun to chill very noticeably. I'm not entirely sure we can ever go back, which is a shame as it's a fantastic pub. Any suggestions for alternative venues will be gratefully received.
I Hate My Boss Part One:  He just approached me to 'tell me off' for applying for the EMI Classics job without his permission, maintaining eye-to-breasts contact the whole way through (I hasten to point out, someone else noticed this and drew my attention to it). He's always finding excuses to have a go at me, which I find quite unfair.
urlLink Ewwwwww
I've been trying it out in its constituent parts for about the past two weeks but today represents U-Day. It's my new look: permanent wearing of my nerdy glasses, next-to-no make up (ditching eyeliner was the worst part) and long, straggly hair tied up in a slap-dash fashion. The 'U' in 'U-day' stands for Ugly.

Bonjour, mes lecteurs fideles. Al's  urlLink Correct Opinion  on 80s music is worth a look this morning if you find yourself drifting from your work tip.
Okay, I give up. I can't do this web publishing thing if I have to keep moving my blog.
This is related, but I've wanted to say it for ages. Everything Alan Partridge listens to/spins in I'm Alan Partridge is *brilliant*.

No more posts on Christianity. I didn't mean to throw petrol on the barbecue, or conversely, piss on anyone's bonfire.
Five Least Favourite 'Things' Pertaining To Living In The UK:  1. The Thatcher hangover. 2. The record-buying public's insistence on buying shite like Snow Patrol and Maroon 5. 3. The expense. 4. The fact that Michael Howard's going to win the next election. 5. Generally speaking, the weather.
Top of the morning. Interesting  urlLink interview with Ron  in the Observer yesterday. I may be w
