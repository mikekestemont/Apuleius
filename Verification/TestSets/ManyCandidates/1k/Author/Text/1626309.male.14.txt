Today and tomorrow are our last days in the Phoneix Buliding. On Wednesday and Thursday, the construction crew will ready the buliding to be taken down on Friday, when we shall have an opportunity to watch! When you arrive on Wednesday, you shall go to the gym in Porter where you will met your morning meeting teacher. Those students whose morning and afternoon meeting have been in Porter will continue to go to their designated classrooms. All Phoenix meetings will meet in the gym, in their groups. As you know, we have all day field trips scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday of this week. When you return from your trips, you shall go to the gym. Please be sure you take your entire set of belongings home on  TUESDAY  or else they will be thrown away on Tuesday night!   Leave nothing in Phoenix.
Thank you to all for a lovely Summercomes ceremony and a huge congrats to students for their very impressive collection of academic and 'school spirit' awards. Wow! What a super group of talented individuals. A very special and humongous and thank you goes to our wonderful faculty and staff, without whose efforts, the set up and execution of the day could not have gone so beautifully. Thank you for your hard work. It was a lovely morning.
Next Wednesday and Thursday, your teachers have some wonderfully fun activities planned that will take you off campus for each of the two days. You will leave at 8:30 and return at 2:45. On Wednesday, there are two trips planned...a middle school trip and a high school trip. On Thursday, teachers have planned a Superfunday during which the entire school will take a ride over to Cochituate State Park in Natick for a day of fun activities. Stay tuned for the list of things to do. Then, on Friday... our last day of school, we shall have an opportunity to watch the beginning of the take down of Phoneix. Beginning on  TUESDAY ONLY , students may take 5 minutes at the end of their class in Phoenix to write a message(s) to write a message on the walls of the building (inside, not out!) It must be clean, positive and appropriate. If it's not, it will be scratched out with an indelible marker. If you don't have a class in Phoneix, you may write during break.
ALL DRIVERS must park on the construction lot tomorrow becuase the Summercomes tent will be delivered tomorrow and will block the parking lot to leave.
Don't forget, today is the rehearsal for the talent show. You'll need the music, props, costumes etc. etc. for your act.  IF YOU DON'T HAVE THESE, YOU CANNOT BE IN THE TALENT SHOW!  If you forgot these and cannot be in the talent show. I'm sorry. But don't forget, there is always next year's talent show, and there might be plenty new talent and you can rehearse your act with your new friends next year.

From this morning's  Morning Annoucements   She wanted me to extend a big thank you for your excellent behavior during our presentation last week on brain injury prevention. Our guest thought the students of Willow Hill were very well behaved and bright!

The school boat trip aboard the  Spirit of Boston . The food was great, but this just opinion, the music wasn't that great. However, the sunset was beautiful. I have pictures which I'll scan later. Some kids danced, others walked around the decks, other just and watched the sea, the boats, or people. Judy would like thank the students and teachers.
Today, the tours of the new building were held, and I must say, it looks pretty good. The gym is practically finished, as the work crew are laying down the school emblem and will paint it today. We have seen the new library, science room, the commons, and a typical classroom. The computer lab isn't finished yet. I'd say the school looks good except for the unfinished rooms, which have some wires hanging from the ceiling, but I'm sure that will be fixed by the next two weeks. Oh yes, as an extra surprise... Phoenix will torn down on the last day!! Yay! Now... If I only had some C4 and a detonator.  For information on the new school buliding  urlLink click here
Tomorrow is Friday as you know and will be periods 5-8 and the usual adviser period or meeting. Well maybe it's not that usual, as Judy will be holding a meeting for people going on the boat trip/dance/prom during that time in the Gym (Porter). Also tomorrow, there will be tours once again of the new building (No Name Yet, I'll just call it the Barn, even though this is the first I've called it t
