I just wanted to take a moment to wish everyone a happy Thanksgiving. I need to post this now because I'm leaving to see my grandparents in Columbus, Kansas early tomorrow morning. Have a happy Thanksgiving and drive safely.
I just got back from seeing that new movie, Unbreakable. I can't say much about it without giving away any of the movie, but I highly suggest you see it for yourself. And don't let anyone tell you the ending. It's more fun that way.
Graphics coming soon... I hope...
I just added the resume section, and I uploaded my resume in three different flavors: HTML, PDF, and Corel WordPerfect.
I just added my class schedule for the fall 2000 semester to the school section. If for some reason you care what classes I have and when I have them, then you might want to check it out.
I just got NewsPro installed and working on the site. Now I can post a buttload of pointless news on this site anytime I want!
Mario Lemieux is making his return to the NHL tonight against the Maple Leafs. The game coverage begins at 6 PM CST on ESPN2, and the game begins at 6:30 PM CST on ESPN. I can't wait!
I know that Christmas is almost over now, but I just wanted to make sure that I wished everyone a merry Christmas. I hope everyone had a great day.
yeah... finals at 7:30 in the morning suck.
I just got the greatest, most unbelievable news today. After four years of retirement, Mario Lemieux is coming back to the NHL! He is by far my favorite hockey player of all time, and I so excited that he's back. He's expected to start playing for the Penguins again in January. What's cool about this is that he will not only own the Penguins, but he will also be playing for them. Not only that, but he is also already in the hockey hall of fame. How cool is that? I can't wait until January!
I know It's been quite a while since I last posted news, so here is everything interesting that has happened to me in the last month.  I spent the end of December and New Years in Kansas City hanging out with some of my friends from school. I then got on a bus and headed to Denver to spend a week at the Denver Christmas Conference (DCC) for Campus Crusade. Once again, DCC was awesome! This was my third DCC trip, and every year is a blast! I learn so much, and I get to hang out with my friends as well as make totally new friends. Everyone should go to DCC at least once.  I got back to Kansas City on Sunday, spent one more night at my friend Justin's place, got back to Wichita on Monday morning, and was back at school in Manhattan Tuesday night. I had to do some last minute enrollment so that I could be a full-time student by Thursday when classes started back up. This looks to be about the hardest semester of classes I've ever had. I just hope I can keep up.  Perhaps the most interesting story from the past month happened last night. Over Christmas break, some of my friends and I thought it would be a good idea to start skateboarding. So once we got back to school, some of us started purchasing skateboards so that we could start learning. For about the last week, we have been practicing our ollies, and last night, on the way to dinner, some of my friends were out skating. Knowing that I had a few minutes to kill, I decided to try a couple ollies. On about the third attempt, something went wrong, and I ended up kissing the board! Initially, I thought I just bit my lip a bit, but once I washed all of the blood off my face, I noticed that I had one large cut on my bottom lip and an even deeper one right below my lip. After a quick trip to the emergency room, I ended up with ten stitches and a sore chin. I guess my ollie could use a little more work.  Anyway, that's pretty much all of the interesting stuff that has happened in the last month. This semester is already looking to be one of the best ever. In the future, I hope to keep up on my news postings so that I don't have to do any more extremely long postings like this one.
Alright, here's the deal... the FATLAN Party was scheduled for March 9th, and Clint, who has been doing most of the planning for the party, is not going to be able to attend on the 9th. Since Clint can't be there on the 9th, we have decided to move the party to March 30th. That will be the first Friday night after we get back from spring break. Hopefully this date will work out for all of the people who have already registered, as well as the people who were still planning on registering. We will be sending out an e-mail to all of the K-State dorms sometime in the next couple days, and we will also have some posters up in the near future. If you have any problems concerning the FATLAN Party, please feel free to  urlLink e-mail  me, and don't forget to check the  urlLink website  for updates. I'm sorry about all the confusion with the dates. Hopefully this new date will stick.
Alright, we've been telling everyone that the FATLAN Party was going to be on Friday March 10 or just saying March 10. We just discovered that March 10 is Saturday. What we really meant to say was that the party is on Friday March 9... yes, March 9. It will not be held on Saturday, so don't come to Putnam Hall Saturday night expecting to play video games with a basement full of people. We may still play some video games with you, but there's no way we can fit more than 5
