Read 1 Timothy 4:12    Can there be a better way to start off a webpage for youth than with one of the most powerful scripture passages for youth???  I think not! :)  Paul was writing Timothy (who was most likely a teen!), encouraging him to do TWO main things:  1.  To not let anyone (the old folk) look down on him because he was young, and                     2.  To be an example to all those around him by the way he talked, the way he lived, the way he loved, what he believed,                      and the way he lived morally.    So does it sound like a piece of cake to do?  Or does it sound impossible or crazy?  Personally, I know that when I was in high school, I thought that this was nothing but wishful thinking.  Because how was I supposed to get the grown-ups to look up to me???  It wasn't recently until it hit me--Part 1 of the verse happens BY LIVING OUT THE SECOND PART OF THE VERSE!  By setting and example   in speech, in life, in love, in faith, and in purity.    So let me encourage you to be that example that Paul calls us to be!  You can do it!  Peace...
Testing. Testing.  One, two, three.  Is this on?  Ok, I think it is....:).    Hola peeps!!!    To the youth of St. Alban's in Waco, my friends, co-workers, my family in beautiful Virginia, and the random wanderer--WELCOME to the Youth Advance, where you can come for daily thoughts, scripture verses, prayer requests, and more!  Here's another way to look at it:      Come get your daily fuel!!    ...a chance for perhaps a little inspiration and direction.  This is your friend and brother Aaron here...I hope this is of service to ya'!  It's my prayer that this blog is used to the glory of God!  So let's begin the glimpse....
"Holy Fire"  Holy Fire from heaven Descend to us we pray Let us burn again Holy Fire from heaven Consume our hearts today Let us burn again...let us burn again   All my peeps in the house raise their hand if they're familiar with the phrase, "On fire for God"....ah yes, by the looks of it there's a good number of you who have heard it or used it before.  (Forgive my imagination...I've had some late late, sleep-deprived nights watching the biggest sporting event in the world...the World Cup baby!!) :)  Anyways, it is pretty safe to say that most Christians have heard that phrase used.  You come home from a camp or retreat where you feel as if God has spoken to you and you make a commitment to Him...that you wont' let the fire He lit in you die out.  Or you've been on a mission trip and have been so moved by witnessing the power of Christ firsthand, that its as if you've been set ablaze for him.  I know I've used it plenty of times personally...what about you?  Contact me and let me know your take on it.   In my previous entry, I talked about how easy it is to feel all parched, weak, and in need of nourishment from God.  Jesus talks about and the Psalms describe God as a good shepherd who leads his flock to "quiet waters", out of danger, and into "green pastures" (Psalm 23).  When the prophet Elijah was running for his life...he eventually collapsed in exhaustion and was on the verge of death, and God came and fed him and nourished him.(1 Kings 19)  After fasting for 40 days and being constantly tempted by the devil, Matthew 4 tells us that Jesus was immediately attended to and taken care of by angels.  It seems like its when we're the most weak or dead on the inside that God comes to us to nourish us, or in other words, put a spark in us.  The thing about a spark or a small flame is that its potential is unending.  However, it is really easy to put out while its still small.  Think about how hard it is to keep a match lit when it is windy or wet!  So when God gives us that spark on the inside, its up to us to enable it to grow...and not only enable it to grow, but to let it spread!  Forest fires are, at times, impossible to stop b/c of their fury, strength, and size...however, they usually are started by a single flame or spark that can often be extinguished by a little water.    Many of you will go away to camps or mission trips this summer and come back changed....  on fire  .  If you're not careful, that spark or flame can be put out as soon as you return home....but let me encourage you to fan into that flame so that it'll grow into a beautiful and powerful blaze!  Remember, it needs to grow (through prayer, Bible study, etc.) and it needs to spread (to other people)...that way it will never go out!  Finally, you don't have to wait for a camp or mission trip to catch fire!  Pray the words of the song at the beginning of this entry:   Holy Fire from heaven Descend to us we pray Let us burn again Holy Fire from heaven Consume our hearts today Let us burn again...let us burn again    Matthew 7:7-8, "Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and door will be opened to you.   For everyone who asks receives... " So ask God for it in holy expectancy...for His Holy Fire from heaven will come and consume your heart  today ....ask Him.  Ask Him.
Ever since moving to Texas, I've learned to really appreciate the value of a nice cool glass of water...or even better, Bush's Sweet Tea!! Mmmmmmmmmmmm.  The heat and dryness around here literally sucks the moisture from your mouth so that you quickly get parched, especially if you're outside in the sun.    That's just how life is too isn't it.  The energy and joy we have often gets drained by trials and troubles of l
