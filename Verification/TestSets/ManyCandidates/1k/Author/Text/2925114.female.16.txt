today was great. i had an awesome day. i just woke up and felt like it was going to be a great day, and it was. untill 5th. my history teacher put the marks up on the wall. i looked up my number (yes we're numbered) and i saw 39% i must have checked it at lest 4 times. it was horrible, i've never failed anything in my life. it was crazy. so in my stubborn ways, i've decided not to talk to my teacher for a while. I dont know why i'm just mad. i dont deserve this mark. my boyfriend had to go to Co-op so i didnt have anyone to vent to either. oh well it'll pass. I'm reading a really interesting book, it's called The Perks of Being a Wallflower. by stephen....something i dont know, im too lazy to go to my bag and get it. lol i'm watching Fresh Prince of Bell-Air and will just burnt down his house. great show. anyways I best be off.

Today was my brave day. I got my  bellybutton pierced ! yah! It rocked. Chris almost didn't come so that kinda sucked, but then he did so it was less sucky. I loved it so much more becuase he was there. It was so much better! He held my hand the whole time, I admit it, i was scared. It was way more comforting. My mom was there too and it didnt hurt as much as my nose... but it still hurt. Nothing I cant handle. Yup so I have to keep reminding myself i have it done because it is way too cool for me to even start to understand. It rocks, i cant get over it. Yup so I thought I'd write my thoughts about it because I've got so muh energy now after having it done!  YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
back again for a quickie... haha quickie..lol Just a thought, if you can get your hands on a Tyler Clarke CD please take the liberty to do so! $10. Not a big deal when your buying the next biggest indie groups' masterpiece huh?? Oh and the drummer's pretty good too. Tyler Clarke!!!! WOO become a Clarkemaniac, buy the CD.  My favourite song on the CD: Nick's Waltz, just to let you know.... ;)  Nesss
Hello, well today I woke up, packed aand then I was off to London for Easter. I wish I could tell you it was London England I was going to. psssh yaah right! nope just London Ont. for me. Anyways I have family down here. Aunt, Uncle, two baby cousins, my entertainment for the next three days.:D absolutley adorble. My aunt did this fortune telling thing. It was with tea leaves.. I'll explain.  1) You pours you some tea, with tea leaves in it. 2) You drink the tea (Imagine that!) 3) When your done the leaves are left in the bottom. 4) You flip the cup over onto the saucer. 5) You turn the cup counter-clockwise 3 times.  6) For the first turn you make, you think of a wish. 7) For the second turn you think of something you hope for. 8) For the third, you think of a dream you have. 9) When you're done all that mumbo-jumbo you flip the cup over and whatever is left in the cup is supposed to form a picture that predicts your future or says something about your life. But you have to tip the cup and let the remaining liquid drop from it, and the more tea that drops out, the more you'll cry over something in the near future.  So from my "reading" we concluded that I was going to have a huge cry in the near future. However, it would pass very quickly. Umm I'm going to receive a piece of mail (whether it be email or a letter) that's related to love. There was a picture of a cabin. (I have a little shack on my property for partying). There were three characters in a circle. My aunt said that these three were my friends aand I. SO I guess it's Me, Meliss, and Adrienne. Which is freaky because she doesn't know anything aboutmy life aat home let alone my circle of friends. And apparently a circle of anything means my wish will come true... YES!!! Umm there was a rabbit which meant that I had a n ememy I should look out for. My aunt said she had a feeling that the enemy was about something in my acting. Hmm I could name a few....there was some other stuff but I'd rather not make that too public for now.. Well that's my fortune not that you care, but hey just telling you.  I went to see Dawn of the Dead recently with my boyfriend. Best movie ever. And by best I mean worst I ever seen! They had to resort to severaal sex scenes to wake up the audience, and apparently there was a Bruce Cambell impersonation... I say apparently because I've never seen the guy before, I think they saaid he was from the Evil Dead movies or something.  Well Happy Easter to all and to all a good night!!  Ness*
