Well I've had the most unfortunate luck of being on a football team. Why you ask? Well I now have practice from 12-3 and then 4:10-6:30. I know, that's something that you would expect, dedecation asides, I really like doing nothing. It's good for me though, because I get to stay in shape.  I have been ignoring my blogging duties. I'm ashamed because I have thought about it and it has been in the back of my mind. I have thought over and over again "You need to update your blog.". Puke. I am too lazy, and I was enjoying my vacation time.  I'm going to be a junior in high school, the big One-One. A year before my senior year, which is the year most colleges look at most intensly. Sucks for me because I don't intend to spend all my time on school this year. I want to experience a lot of stuff. I like always being able to talk to jess right now. She's there, I'm here, and we're happy(at least I am). It's going to suck, because we both have school then practice, and anything outside of it(community service, school functions) and I won't be able to see her as much but it's okay. It's not like she leaves me anyways.  Corny or not, I feel that no matter where in time I might be, she'll be there. She always will I hope, and I promise to always be there for her.  This fills me with great joy, to know that she too can feel the same way as I do and not have to wonder about whether this is true. Everyone would assume that I might be too young to love. Isn't that a complete contradiction? It's like saying you don't know what your emotions are. I know I love her, because I can feel it. I know this because when I'm around her there is a certain feeling of euphoria that I feel. I feel comfortable, I feel true. I can speak what I want, with her understanding me. It's a feeling of warmth, it's like the sun. It's immense power blinds a person who looks too much, just like my love for her, which might possibly be strong enough to kill. I feel good expressing this, I love my Jess...  -Cheers, Rod
I've changed my mind so much I can't even trust it. My mind has changed me so much I can't even trust myself.  Well I woke up with some really nice and really bad messages on my away thingy. I see that the extra mile i've gone to show Dan that you can't ignore me seems to be working. The away messages, signing up to myspace and inviting everyone to by my friend...but i'm bored of it. He thinks i'm a bad friend I suppose. So i'll leave it at that.  Football season offically starts this sunday. Pre-season...wee...then after that I start practice with pads! Yay! I've waited to long with pent up anger, now I get to unleash it all. Fucking sweet. I'm so excited. Who cares if we win, I'm just going to fuck some people up.  I'm really happy, or at least these couple of days I have been. I can't wait to get back to school and see some people...most which I don't want to see, but some I can't wait to see.   This post sucks.   -Cheers,   Rod
Not that i'm saying your wrong(which you are) but Punk came before all that in 1970's. Grunge is okay, as long as it's done right(Nirvana, Alice In Chains). You're just to biased. Music is music, take it for what it's worth. But, most of your music was right, alternative is sucking, pop punk and what not is shit right now(althought there is a lot of great punk, you're just too naive to know it) and rock is taking a turn for the worst, just like Hip-Hop did. You ask what's worse? How about Rock/Rap? Linkin Park already pissed on musical history by actually selling CD's enough to make it platinum. Then we're insulted by them released a "re-mix c.d.". Wait a minute, back in the day shti like this got you shot. The beatles never released their remixed hits. You'll see frank, metal is becoming the next fad. After emo and punk are out done by stores like Hot Topic and magazines like YM by exposing these genres as the "Fad of the year." you'll then see that Metal will be the next sound for the next revolution. Believe it or not, more and more people are buying into the "Shadows fall guitar solo" crap. Our generation of musicians are all lost trying to find the next "Big seller." and small underground bands (such as punk and metal which sells have never been a big point, they've always chosen indie publishers to produce c.d.'s). If you ask me the reason Emo and Punk are so big right now it's because the real meat of the industry is lacking. Smaller bands like The Adicts for example, play in small venus and actually have a closer interaction with their fans then, let's say'; KoRn does playing a 10,000 people arena. You gotta realize though, there's more than just liking music because it's "Not mainstream." This is a long ass comment by the way.-------------------------- Excerpt from my conversation on Myspace...:(  -cheers, Rod
I've never been an art and crafts kind of guy. I can draw, well, I kick ass at drawing. But besides that, i've never, ever been able to shape something out of nothing. So when I sat around with Andrew contemplating the mysteries of space, love, and the grass while he weaved; I never gave second thought to even attempt to creat anything.  *Begin Flashback* Insert wavey blurriness  I sat their and wondered in amazement at how he could manipulate the threads to his liking and produce beautiful pieces of jewlery worthy of being sold for "vintage" at Abercrombie & Fitch. I didn't give thought of trying, I know I suck at building t
