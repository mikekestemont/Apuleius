Today I took the first steps towards going on student exchange in the US. I hope to get into the Los Angeles campus of Ithaca University which concentrates on film & TV. Students also get assigned internships at TV & film studios such as Warner Bros and Universal - so I am really banking on getting in. It is in Burbank right next to Hollywood which is a much nicer area than the other choice California State University which is downtown LA.
Played 18 holes of golf today. The first 9 holes I got 22over par again!!! (What are the odds) Did much better in the 2nd 9 holes with 11 over par so I'm back on track and almost ready to go have a hit with Dad.
After Farenheit had finished and the credits started to roll the majority of the 100 or so crowd started to clap. I find this behaviour weird, do they clap at all movies? I've seen some crap films but when it was over none of the audience or myself felt the need to boo or hiss. If you saw Farenheit and people clapped let me know!
Here is an anti-Moore website that has various bits of info about Moore. It is not that great but there is an article about Moore lifting various scenes of Farenheit from other filmmakers one of them is an Australian, represent! There is also a book out at the moment available on Amazon called "Michael Moore Is A Stupid Fat Man".  http://www.MooreWatch.com/
This film made me snigger a lot. I was amazed by the unique individual that is George W. Bush. I had heard this film was incredibly bias but I was surprised at the restraint that was actually used. Sure Bush and his pals cop it, but David Letterman has probably showed Bush to be more of an idiot and incompetant than Moore has managed to. I did enjoy the film and it was good to see almost absolute majority new footage of Iraq war. The images of the civillian and army casualties was pretty horrific but the interviews with the teenage officers was even more shocking. I thought it was a bit too broad of a subject and I would of been more interested if the whole movie would have been of Bush, he intrigues me. The stunts Moore pulled weren't very elaborate and didn't really prove much but the interviews and research were insightful. Not as good as Bowling For Columbine and seemed a little rushed but I guess he was trying to put it out in time for the election. Story: 3/5    Production: 4/5    Film: 7/10
I locked my car keys in my car half an hour before my lecture was going to start at Uni today. Thankfully RACQ were on the scene in record time and within 11minutes of my phone call my keys were in my hands.
Went and saw Wil Smith get jiggy with robots tonight. I didn't expect the greatest film I just hoped it would be better than the advertisements that TV has been flooded with of late. It was indeed better than the ads, but the obvious ads inside the film were a bit insulting. The filmmakers would like to thank Audi, JVC and Converse! Converse actually got a couple lines of dialogue and JVC and Audi got numerous plugs throughout the film. Other than that, the effects and overall look of the film was very clean and directed OK by Aussie Proyas represent! Being a fan of Dark City it was interesting to see his approach for I, Robot. The story wasn't overly great but the themes of prejudice and trust were pretty evident. I did enjoy it especially the robot on robot battles and the cute old school robots which are replaced. The robots did move a bit like the robots from Phantom Menace but that is to be expected. Story: 2/5   Production: 4/5    Film: 6/10

Toadfish clocked up his tenth year on Neighbours last week. Even with the nickname of Toadie and the biggest mullet in Australian TV history he has managed to hook up with two luvly ladies. Good work son!

Drove my Dads car back from Brisbane today. Weird driving another car but was fun enough!
Played golf today for the first time in about 10 years. I played at the Merrimac 9 hole course which is the first one I ever played on. It is a piece of crap but cheap $8 for 9 holes. I got 52 on the par 30 so I was 22 over but got progressively better as the game went on. I'll try to play once a week to get me out of the house.   This is not the course!
University starts next week these are my subjects: Business of Film & TV Writing for the Web Advanced Digital Video Media Issues & Controversies Creating Interactivity
At 7:45pm I finally left the seclusion of my house.
After failing in Brisbane 16yr old Conrad succeeded in Sydney with a little help from Marcia.
I have not left my house now for 48hours and it looks like being 72hours before I leave again. In Japan this behaviour is called Hikikomori, it has become a major problem with some Japanese males staying in their rooms for like 6months or longer. I'll keep you posted on my progress.
I learnt a big lesson a few years back Fiona wanted to go see Fight Club at the cinemas. I was like "Brad Pitt! No chick flicks!". I hesitantly agreed to go along to see it at Showcase Cinema in Newcastle. I was pleasantly surprised when David Fincher's name came up and it turned out to be an awesome film. Even though I loved Se7en and 12 Monkeys I still thought Pitt was a pretty boy, after Fight Club I changed my opinion and I no longer avoided Pitt films. This has been a bit of a bad m
