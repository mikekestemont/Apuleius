"It's not that I'm so smart , it's just that I stay with problems longer ." - Albert Einstein  i love this quote of Albert Einstein. It's actually hard to pick a favorite quote of his because he has so many. But i chose this one in particular because it directly relates to advertising. Albert Einstein was a genuis. He was without doubt one of the smartest people who ever lived, but he believes that the reason for his success was that he worked harder. He stayed with problems longer and thought about them longer. This quote should be hung up inside every advertising agency and advertising school. Talent is important, being smart helps, and knowing how to think is essential, but the way you solve creative problems is by working on them...and working on them. You have to be relentless in your search for an answer. You have to know that your first 100 ideas will be lame or have been done before. You have to bang out every stupid/pointless idea, pun or joke you have in you and then keep going. Only by constantly doing that will you uncover original ideas or original uses of ideas. You can't expect to sit down and write a great ad in minutes...I'm sure it has happened. But those are the lucky ones. The really insightful work comes from minds that will not rest...from people who aren't satisfied until they uncover the gold that lies in every brief. These are the people who create great works of art. These are the people who can crack any problem you throw out them.
I think being creative lies in 4 things.  1) learning the most you can about creativity and art. That means reading every book you can on advertising and having an unsatiable thirst for literature, film, and art. The person who is the most educated will have a better foundation from which to build on. They will know what great art is. They will know what techniques will provide the desired effects or emotions they want to create. They will be knowlegable to make a decision and to back it up because they have done the research and have seen what's been done before.  2) Relizing that creativity is a craft. When I hear people say "you can't teach creativity" I want to tell them to get the hell out of an art school then, because they are wasting their time and more importantly mine. Thinking creatively is a skill that you master by learning techniques and doing things over and over and over. You must challenge you mind to think laterally and forgo the usual paths of thought. You must push yourself to think in a way that will produce great ideas that will effect people.  3) Work until you can't work anymore. That's the only way you will ever get to the great ideas. If you go with your first idea, odds are everyone will have that idea too. You can be satisfied with getting a concept and doing 10 ads. You have to do 100...you have to rewrite headlines until you feel sick...you have to think of as many visuals for your concept as you can. You have to go as far out as you can and just keeping producing ideas. The more ideas the better, because 99% of them will suck. And if you think that you're so good that you solve things on the first go, then have fun working in kinkos for the rest of your life.  4) Never stop growing. Too often a writer, director, or even client creates something great and then becomes content to ride that for as long as possible. They become complacent and refused to push themselves. They find what is comfortable and stick with it over and over. They wind up producing the same ideas over and over. That is creative suicide. By refusing to constantly learn and grow, you become stagnant in a world where things are forever changing. You will never be great unless you constantly force yourself to be uncomfortable ...unless you constantly put yourself in new stuations. You must always be ready to experience the new and unusual.  And most imprtantly, you must always be pushing your work to the next level. You can never be satified or you are dead.  That is what I think is the key to creativity. How do I think I excel or lack in it? I don't know, I'm just at the beginning of a long journey.
Allright, here's the deal. You have 2 best friends who just graduated college. They sit around watching cartoons and eating potato chips as they try to figure what to do with the rest of their lives. They are prompted by their mom's nagging to "get a real job," and answer an ad for a sales job. What ensues is a hilarious day as the two friends are sent out into "the field" to try to learn the dangerous world of door to door salesmen. From being chased by the cops to breaking into buildings to confronting a harley driving biker, the craziness never ends. And to top it all off, it turns out that the company is actually a cult out to spread their JUICE (join us in creating excitemnt) gospel. Hilarious to the end.  And don't no one think about writing this...it's already written. Not that any sane person would though.
Suggested topics for Bloggs  1) research an ad agency and briefly describes its history, famous campaigns and staff.  2) Find a favorite long copy ad, find out who wrote it and describe his/her style. Maybe try to imitate it.  3) pick apart your favorite campaign and find out who did it, why it works and why it was different.  4) Talk about your individual taste, your passion, and how that ads to your concepting skills. (for example: I love to read novels and I believe its important to know how the great writers write.)  5) Make a list of required reading for anybody in t
