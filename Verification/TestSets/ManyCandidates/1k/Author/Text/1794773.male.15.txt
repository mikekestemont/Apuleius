Hey Girly gurls!! It's Erica. We so need to have another movie night sometime really soon. I heard about the possible one at kristen's house but I'm not really sure about what is all going on. So could someone call me or something. and please pray for me cuz I'm kinda stressed out from everything thats going on this summer like driver's training and poms. yeah it's really crazy. can't wait till it's all over with. so hope to see you guys at the next movie night whenever that is. and I love u guys so futching much.                     Love, Erica
Hey pajama gang! You guys are the best friends anyone could have. Seriously, i think we have the most memories than ive ever had in my entire life, during just one night. lol. I know that I can always trust you guys with things or problems that i tell you. You all futching rock by the way! I love you all!!                     ~Rach~
Heloo Everyone!! So right now.. i'm the only one who's actually in this thing.. but hey if anyone knows Krista's, Nicole's or Brittany's email address.. i really need them!!
lol whoa guys im sorry i put that message in twice. Erica, you are like the best person ever. Seriously guys, me and Erica talked for like an hour about Orlando and guys and everything. Erica i really dont wanna stop you from goin to cedar point with poms though. We really all need to get together soon if we wanna work out plans and have a movie night. About that. Krista said she was having one so ill wait for her to tell the dates i guess. I really wanna talk to you!!! I love you all like i love chocolate! Love, Rach
rach I think thats a great idea. I guess I don't have to go with poms. I'm not even sure if we're going. but we will need to make plans for that real soon. like when and how we'll get there. I'm not sure if it will all work out but I think it will be really fun. so krista or rachael or anyone who hasnt had a movie night I think we should have one real soon. just pick a day any day is fine for me. cuz we sure have lots and lots to talk about.   LOVE, Erica.
Ok guys, I have an idea. Maybe we should all get together and go to Cedar Point!! Becca, Kristin, and I didnt exactly have the best time last time we went. It's just an idea though. I wanna go on all of the rides that i missed last time. If you guys agree or wanna do it just write back or call me and maybe we can work out a plan. Ah Erica you are going with poms though. We can talk about that later. I really wanna talk to you guys! I miss you a lot. Love, Rach
OMG guys. Orlando was soooo awesome. I'm so glad that I saw all of u there except Carissa... what happened to you. I dunno maybe I'm  just blind. but the Relient K concert was so much fun. They are soo good. Me and Maryel and other peace ppl were in the front row. I mean front and center it was so awesome. but it got kinda crazy cuz everyone was jumping and it was so futching hot and I was so sweating and on top of that everyone was pushing us and then we fell over. but other then that it was really fun.          I have more to say but I can't think of it right now. and we really need to have a movie night really soon b4 school starts cuz we have alot of things we need to talk about.
Hey girls, sorry i didn't write for a really really long time. Orlando was so futching awesome!!! i'm so glad i saw most of y'all. we saw some mighty fine men down there. ;) i have lots of good stories too so lets have a sleepover. and i hate how we always say we are gonna hang out and never do so we need to stop doing that. love you all!!!
Ok so Orlando was the best thing ever! I had such an awesome experience and i have SO many stories to tell. Krista, whens the movie night? I thought everything was so cool there, and it worked out great. Our hotel was super super awesome! Erica im so sorry i didnt call you on the last night. I was out in the lobby till like 3. I hated that one skit though about the v space crap. Omg if you guys heard someone say: yeah!!" a bunch of times, that was lil old Micah. lol. Jen left for California today. I think that was one of the hardest things to do, say goodbye to her. W
