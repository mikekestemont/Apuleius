HA sounds like a loser to me,.  ok well i just had to get all that off my mind.  anyway i am so  p.o'd my mom is so fricken wrong about me. she throws words in my mouth and seems to think that she knows how i feel or how i think. she is so wrong!   also she wouldn't let me go to chelsea's err.  well thats it samie

Today during spanish Aelx was like " Sam you could sit there if u want" i dunno y. i really don't even know her that well or anything. but i didn't... i was lik "i'm fine n stuff. uhhh today was the reinactment of the revoulitanry war it was really boring. the clothes guy liked salena though.

I remember when my life was flawless. When my worst problem was a boy touched me. And i actually thought that was a problem. But as I've grown their is atleast one thing that i have learned.My problems are only going to get harder. My biggest problem right now is well i don't really like the way i look. And thats not even really a problem...  Today I had a feildtrip and my mom was the chaperone. It was soooo boring it was baseball game and basically i hate baseball even more then i use to. My arms got seriosly sun burnt. they r like so really ugly!.
ok so nothing happened today (not to me at least). although we did have 20 minute classes and we got to watch a movie.     My brother got into a fight though, he won too.     See nothing has really happened. except now im babysitting Karl and I'm getting paid a milkshake yum. Well I'll write later    Samie
ok so most of you know that my fave color is pink and how i wear it every day basically i'm kind of obsessedd with it(along with usher!)  well anyway pink is my thing and every since i started wearing it alot of people at my school are trying to do the pink thing. and they so can't couse it's my thing! Like shavan for instance is always wearing pink EVERYDAY. She's totally copying me. THat drives me off the wall. If i was trying to start a new trend it would be really cool. but i'm not. I'm the orignal. and soon nobody will think of me as the person that wears pink but as somebody that goes with flow. and i so don't.     Samie
