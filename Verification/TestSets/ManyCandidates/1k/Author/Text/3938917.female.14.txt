Updating my blog whoo...It's got to be the most boring blog in the world, which isn't a problem I guess because as of right now, I'm the only one who knows about it.&nbsp; It's just my way to keep track of what goes on in my life since I'm not too good at it.&nbsp; Haha, I'm ridiculous.&nbsp; Yesterday I got to see Tyler and play which made me very happy because one thing I'm sure of is that he's leaving for Canada tommorow...I'm such a sad girl.&nbsp; Oh well, he's supposed to be back the 11th so I have something to look forward to.&nbsp; It's so&nbsp;bad that he's the only thing I can ever thing to&nbsp;write about...it's become an obsession...but some obsessions&nbsp;you just can't avoid and I think hes definetly ok to be obsessed with.&nbsp; I saw Stacey yesterday too which was definetly a cool thing because she hasn't came around since December or so...but she took us to the mall and I got the new TBS cd...which is excellent for those of you who haven't heard it (it's so pathetic that I pretend I'm writing to people...lol) and I got RHPS and ATHF Vol. 1 and 2 on DVD so I'm set for a while.&nbsp; Then we went to DQ for some ice cream...yum.&nbsp; K-Woody called me last night and wants us to go to the Charleston fair today so I'm getting ready...to go get ready for that lol.&nbsp; It could be ok I guess, town fairs aren't too bad sometimes...but that's where I'll be today.&nbsp; As of tomorrow, and this weekend, and until the 11th, I'll wander about aimlessly trying to find something to do as I await the return of Tyler...and Lloyd...HAHA...ok, but as of now, I'm going to go get ready.&nbsp; Bye!
Ok, so me and Damian went to Bub's house tonight cause that's where you go to "have a good time."&nbsp; Lol, or so Damian told me that before we left...it was his motive to go.&nbsp; Anyways, we got there and Andy and Tyler were there too so I watched Bub play his Gamecube for a while and then played with his snake which was really cool cause I like snakes :)&nbsp; But anyways, didn't really have time to play...and he's leaving for Canada for Friday which is sad...oh well, he'll have fun for sure.&nbsp; But anyways, that's about all that went on today on this busy Monday in July...whooo...and I'm watching Newsies and listening music and talking to people AND playing Sims on my other computer; I'm a multitasker.&nbsp; Well, I'm going now, maybe something interesting will happen soon that can take up more space to write about.
Wow, I have the stupidest computer on the face of the earth.&nbsp; I haven't been able to get on since like...Thursday becase it's been down the whole time, causing me to be incredibly angry.&nbsp; Oh well, I'm on now and I guess that's all that matters...right?&nbsp; No, I guess things could be a lot better.&nbsp; Tyler says you can always be happier...but sometimes I think I couldn't be happier anywhere else on earth.&nbsp; For example, when I'm with him, we don't even have to be doing anything and I'm perfect.&nbsp; It's just my surroundings I guess.&nbsp; But anyways, Friday was kind of crazy.&nbsp; Brock had a band practice at his house and he left kinda early from it and everyone else just kind of happened to hang around afterwards.&nbsp; I didn't even realize Brock had left, but then&nbsp;Steve and Trena got home...and they weren't too happy that we were all there...without Brock.&nbsp; So we tried to explain that we didn't know Brock had even left but they didn't believe us.&nbsp; So we left, and Damian, Jesse, Fox, and I were on our way to Mike James' house and Steve called...apparently someone went into his bathroom and knocked over some jar that had his wedding ring on top of it and he couldn't find it.&nbsp; Well, we didn't know what had happened, so Damian finished his convo with him and hung up.&nbsp; He called later and Steve had found it...good deal, because the blame could have easily been pushed over onto any one of us, and that would have sucked.&nbsp; So anyways, we hung out at Mike's the rest of the night...it was kind of boring but what can you expect?&nbsp; Then, Saturday we all went to Kim's party thing that she had...which I thought was pretty boring too.&nbsp; Bitter Ending got to play and so did Jade's band whatever they're called, so it wasn't a total drag, but Jesse insisted we leave at 8 o'clock which again angered me.&nbsp; So many stupid little things can set me off, maybe I'm bipolar or something.&nbsp; Not sure, doesn't really matter I guess...I'm breathing and it gets me through.&nbsp; Anyways, when I got home I watched Labyrinth and then went&nbsp;to bed which brings us to today...Sunday.&nbsp; I slept until 1 p.m. because I was really tired, though I'm not sure why, it's not like I stayed up very late.&nbsp; When I did wake up though, the family was eating lunch...barbecue ribs and some kind of steak...ick...so I fixed some peanut butter and jelly and then came down and fiddled with the computer for&nbsp;a couple of hours before I finally got it working.&nbsp; I had to do a restore on it, and that made it kind of work...but anyways, I'm bored yet again, so I'm going to find something productive to do...hopefully.&nbsp; Until my next post, later dayz.
So today's Thursday.&nbsp; I have had a wonderful 2 days.&nbsp; Yesterday, I went to Tyler's and played, which was a lot of fun.&nbsp; Then I went to my dad's house which isn't important, but that was basically my day.&nbsp; Then, today, me and Damian went to Brock's house for band practice and then to Ty's at around 7.&nbsp; Not really much to say about it, except it's been fun!!&nbsp; I like days like these.&nbsp; Tomorrow is Friday and Damian has to go back to work, so I'm going to have to find something to do...which c
