About-Face on North Korea: Allies Helped By DAVID E. SANGER  ASHINGTON, June 23 — President Bush's concrete offer to cajole North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program is a turning point for an administration previously caught between two conflicting approaches to one of the world's most isolated, impoverished and dangerous nations.  One camp, encompassing many in the Pentagon and Vice President Dick Cheney's office, has argued for further isolating North Korea's government and pressing for its collapse. Another, rooted in the State Department and some corners of the National Security Council, has said that Kim Jong Il, North Korea's leader, should be put to the test, given a serious offer that lays out what kind of benefits would flow if he gave up an expanding nuclear program. For now, that camp has won the day.  Mr. Bush selected his course because he had little choice: his Asian allies, picking up signals that the government of Mr. Kim may finally be willing to make a deal, were quietly beginning to negotiate a separate peace.  But perhaps as notable as Mr. Bush's turnabout is what it is missing: the kind of threats that surrounded his confrontation with Saddam Hussein last year. Though American intelligence agencies have warned Mr. Bush that North Korea is probably putting the finishing touches on six or more nuclear weapons, the president has sounded almost no public warnings about the threat the country poses, or given voice to the fear that it could sell its excess nuclear technology to terrorists or other states. While the administration's offer of assistance carries a three-month expiration date, the proposal sets no enforcement deadlines for North Korea to disarm.  There is no echo of the threat repeated so often prior to the Iraq war, no suggestion that if North Korea refuses to disarm, Mr. Bush will lead an alliance to make it disarm. There is no appetite in Asia or in the White House for such a risk, and the North Koreans know that.  Mr. Bush's senior advisers have insisted all along that the Korean challenge requires a very different strategy. They acknowledge that there are no good military options if North Korea chooses to keep making weapons — only the threat of more of the isolation the country has suffered but survived for half a century.  But in private, some officials also acknowledge that America's troubles in Iraq have changed the global politics of nuclear disarmament. For the benefit of this country's allies, they said, Mr. Bush had to come up with a serious offer — even one laden with conditions for full disclosure, full dismantlement and full inspections that they expect North Korea will reject.  "My hunch is that it's going to be very hard to get North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons," no matter how good the offer, said Kurt Campbell, a former senior Pentagon official during the Clinton administration. He was speaking at a conference on proliferation challenges that was taking place here just as the administration was changing course. "But we need to try," he said, "because if things get unpleasant, we will need to demonstrate to the allies that the diplomatic effort was serious."  Mr. Bush appears to have been pushed by those allies, at least according to the accounts offered up by Asian officials — and confirmed by some but not all — of their American counterparts.  For months, diplomats from China, Japan and South Korea have worried that the talks with North Korea were going nowhere, and they have described Mr. Kim and Mr. Bush as equally stubborn.  In meeting after meeting, North Korea would not engage seriously in talks until it knew exactly what kind of benefits it would receive for giving up its only claim to power, and its only leverage. For his part of the long stalemate, Mr. Bush refused to give in to what he once called "nuclear blackmail."  But by this spring, pressure on the White House had risen. A group of American visitors to North Korea's main nuclear complex reported that 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods — all placed under seal by the International Atomic Energy Agency before its inspectors were expelled 18 months ago — were gone. American intelligence agencies, while disagreeing about the details, concluded that most or all had been converted to bomb fuel, if not actual weapons.  "You could argue about the numbers," said Robert L. Gallucci, the chief American negotiator for the 1994 nuclear accord with North Korea that the Bush administration dismisses as a flawed start, "but not the direction."  South Korea, pressing to engage North Korea, began negotiating aid packages and military agreements. China reportedly paid North Korea millions of dollars just to come to the negotiating table, and publicly began questioning the validity of some of Washington's intelligence about North Korea's second nuclear program. That program was created with help from the Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan.  And Senator John Kerry, the presumptive Democratic nominee, was beginning to charge that Mr. Bush had made America significantly less safe by ignoring the growing North Korean arsenal while it was focused on Iraq. "That was noticed in the White House," one senior State Department official said.  The turning point came in the past two weeks. Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, returned from a meeting with Mr. Kim, whom he had paid handsomely for releasing the relatives of Japanese kidnapped by North Korea years ago.  "I told him face to face, `If you compare what you gain from nuclear weapons and what you gain from dismantlement of your own nuclear program, there would be a difference of heaven and earth,' " Mr. Koizumi told reporters later. At the summit meeting at Sea Island, Ga., earlier this month, Mr. Koizumi told Mr. Bush that he felt the North Korean leader might be serious about making a deal.  Mr. Bush's critics say he waited far too long to make his offer; Mr. Kerry argues it s
