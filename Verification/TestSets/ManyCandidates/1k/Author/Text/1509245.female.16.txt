I can usually spot a fellow music nerd with little evidence. There are the more obvious signs, the bands t-shirts worn to threadbare, the stubs from concert tickets posted in lockers. But there are extra subtles in the true nerds. These are the kids who race home after school solely to listen to music, not to watch TV or have a snack or even to get stoned. They'll listen to the same song over and over, trying to figure out what it does, exactly, to make them feel so alive. These are the kids who thumb through liner notes in the hopes of finding answers.   Music nerds are a unique variation on the classic sense of nerd. Music nerds are not musicians themselves, and if they were to form a band it would be of the tribute variety. Like the band-aid Saphire says about loving music in the movie Almost Famous, "They don't even know what it is to be a fan. Y'know? To truly love some silly little piece of music, or some band, so much that it hurts."   And that is what it is to be a music nerd. It's not cool, it's not scene, it's not hip. Being a music nerd means hugging your stereo, not your boyfriend, as you drift off to sleep. It means understanding Bob Dylan more than you'll ever understand your parents.   I am a one such nerd.  "Half of what I say is meaningless" is to be a diary of expirencing songs. It's not going to be about my doing drugs or boys or whatever my latest pair of shoes cost. It's about songs, and trying to figure out the intangiblities of them that make this nerd continue on being a nerd.
Axis: Bold as Love   As much as I want to convey exactly what it is about a particular selection of music that makes it magical, I can’t. I can’t put my finger on what makes these songs so amazing. And I don’t want to analyze them until they’ve lost their power.  Music is something to be felt, I think, rather than heard. And that perfectly defines ‘Little Wing’. The linear notes of one particular Best Of compilation tells me that the original idea for ‘Little Wing’ was developed while performing with Jimmy James and The Blue Flames in Greenwich Village. It was recorded for  Axis: Bold as Love  in October of ‘67.  My conflict with Jimi, my Jimi, is his mythical quality. There is something about the man who grew up across the state from where I would eventually be born, there is something about him that seems so other-worldly. His swagger, his performances, his  look  all are conveyed with a kind of adeptness that mere mortals don’t possess.  Jimi said, “I dig writing slow songs, because it’s easier to get more blues and feeling into them.” And in the painfully short two minuets and twenty-five seconds of ‘Little Wing’, he certainly packed as much feeling in as he possibly could.  Even if I knew every nuance, all the terminology, for the guitar, I could not possibly explain the way ‘Little Wing’ floats out of my headphones. Some songs are an explosion of music. They fill every corner of the room and force you to notice them. This song achieves a similar effect, but minus the explosion. The music trickles out slowly, smoothly, effortlessly making you listen, and listen carefully.  It’s interesting that in Jimi’s time the word ‘groovy’ was en vogue, because that’s exactly how I feel when I listen to his music. ‘Little Wing’ makes me feel… groovy. The song turns a perfectly normal situation into something that much cooler, groovier, because Jimi is there. And when aided with psychotropic substances, the effect is amplified.  The song is also a mystery; who is this woman? We know she’s got a circus mind, its running round, and that she thinks about moonbeams and butterflies. But then she’s also giving Jimi smiles, comforting him, giving him anything and everything he wants.  Does Jimi love her?  Does it matter?    The beautiful thing about this song is how aligned, and how perfectly matched, the lyrics and the music are. ‘Little Wing’ might just be every bit as breathtaking if Jimi had never bothered to pen words, because the guitar has such standing.  Some have said, apparently, that much of the lyrical content on this record was inspired by Bob Dylan. I can see that, and I suppose it’s a fair assumption, but it’s probably more likely that their styles were simply similar. The quality that both Bob and Jimi posses, as far as writing lyrics is concerned, is their effectiveness. They don’t overpower the song with words, they don’t abuse metaphors, and they never come off as overly ambitious. It’s organic, smooth, effortless.
Not much to report folks. Except for that I've come to the revelation that people tend to trust me with secrets. So much so, in fact, that I find myself being told secrets that I don't WANT to know. Perhaps people mistake my indifference for genuinety, they may think that because I am quiet around them that I am to be trusted. Nay- dear schoolmates- I never proclamied trustworthyness. Not that I will ever tell anyone about the people who entrusted to me that they are gay, that their fathers are in prision in California, or that they are addicted to physic 1-800 numbers. However, the very principal of the matter is that I've been told these things in confidence, and this confidence concerns me. It is a privledge and a responsibility I never asked for.   On the DL, people, I got my John Mayer/Counting Crows ticket in the mail today. Though I hate this phrase, due to it's extreme over usage, I have to admit, it the confindes of this site, "Sweeeet". Now if only I can find some medication that will prohibit me from trampling over concert goers and security gaurds to tackle John...
