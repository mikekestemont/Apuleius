Working is for stupid people, plain and simple.&nbsp; I realize that while it's not very very realistic, I think that everyone should try to pursue a job that either requires the least possible amount of effort from them or one in which so much joy is gotten that the effort spent is worth it.&nbsp; To this end, I have decided to put forth as little effort as possible to my work in this office.&nbsp; One can see evidence of this in the very fact that I'm using my time today to write this entry!&nbsp; What's more, I've often used my time at work to plan vacations and to balance my checkbook.&nbsp; I will add that my checkbook is the most regularly balanced it's ever been this past year. &nbsp; I think, though, that if I can just tough it out for one semester, I'll be okay.&nbsp; I've decided to try to pull everything together to apply for the winter term at Southern Illinois Univeristy - Edwardsville, which I hope will work out.&nbsp; We'll see.&nbsp; Until then, I shall bide my time ... &nbsp; I've never bided (bode?) my time before; it should be fun!

I'm not going to go work out today.  I feel bad knowing that I'm going to skip being good, but I can't help it.  Ted and I just got back from our trip to Florida, and with the incentive of having to take of my shirt gone, I have no desire to work out.  It's sad really, though, that I even feel the need to work out.  Let me clarify this a little.  What's sad is that I have no desire to work out for the health benefits.  For that, I feel that I eat well enough and walk twenty minutes each way to and from the light rail to my house when going to and coming from work.  What I really want when I'm working out is one of those bodies that the men on  Out  or  Men's Fitness  always have.  People have (quite logically tried to convince me that they spend hours per day in the gym and get  paid  to look like that, whereas I just get paid to sit on my arse and goof off on the Internet (!) .  Still, I want such a body!
Have you ever seen that movie  Office Space ?  The protagonist, the one who gets hypnotically cured of his doldrums, points out that "test" that high school counselors give students to learn what they want to be.  The "test" involves thinking of what you would do if you had a million dollars, in other words, if money were no object, what would you do.  The protagonist replies that he'd do nothing.  Now while I agree with him that doing nothing, relaxing and what not, sounds good, I don't think I could do it for an entire day.  In the same film a gangster-rap-loving character with the unfortunate name of Micheal Bolton points out that that "test" is crap because if everyone realized his/her dreams, there would be no janitors, etc.  I think this is true.  High school counselors and optimists in general really ought to stop filling everyone full of hopes.  These hopes have repeatedly gotten me into trouble.  For example, everyone told me so often when I was in high school that because of my grades and my general smarts, I'd get oodles of money to go to school.  Why, in their minds, the schools would just send boxes of money just to  entice  me to go there.  I kept this belief going through a stringent series of extra-curricular activities.  And while I was admitted to every school I applied to, none of them threw money at me.  I ended up going to what I viewed as the crappy state school, because even though they offered no money to me, they were still cheaper than the private schools that had offered money to the tune of half of their fees.  There, the optimism of those around me that spilled into myself let me down.  In college, I worked under much the same guise.  I got horrendously good grades.  I wrote for the student newspaper, double-majored in fours years including a year abroad.  With all of that, I was certain to get into the best graduate programs.  But fat chance.  The programs to which I applied typically have around two-hundred applicants for ten positions.  Those are not good odds, and I'm sure that, like me, every applicant had the best grades with the most glowing letters of recommendation.  I would up getting into the authentically crappy state school (a differnent one now, in a different state) where I work.  The program has turned out to be a dud; I'm trying to escape.  But here again, stupid optimism has gotten the worse of me.  I think that high school counselors need flat out to tell studens, "some of you will be custodians, the vast majority of you will have jobs that will only ever give you enough must just to get by.  You're life will be one of back-breaking work, for mere fractions of what the most successful make, and there's not a damn thing you can do about it.  So, stop your bitching and get to work."
It's nearing four o'clock central time, which means that it's almost time for me to go to my class.  The class was the most interesting choice that I had, given that fact that it's summer and I'm studying graduate-level philosophy.  Still, I have to admit that I a bit bored with what I knew would be a boring class.  It's on Descrates'  Meditations  which are,  sans question ,
