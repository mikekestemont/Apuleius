Business is up again and we are all like in battlefield. Many new dealers, many new orders, many phone calls, ordering stuffs, replying emails, arguing with boss and customers.....It made my head and my mind stiffed! Neck is so sour....I wanna sleep...!  Thank you Honie for the lovely cake....!
urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink     We’ve spent a weekend in L.A., taking pictures with Perry in her graduation, and attending Nancy & Paul’s wedding. In spite of the long voyage and fatigue, it was a wonderful weekend, especially the wedding. It was definitely the nicest one I’ve ever been. It is not due to 5 stars hotel or how much money was spent, it is the warm feeling and the blissful atmosphere the newly-wed has injected. They want to bring the guests as much joy as they have. They provided the finest beverages, excellent meal; they invited the top live band to entertain. Yet, the most impressive part is that, during the banquet, they came to you, thank you and talked to you. It made you feel like you were just as significant as their family members.  We danced a lot, and I drank a lot too - 3 glasses of red wine, 2 glasses of Champaign and 1 glass of white wine.  I am longing to attend another wedding like this!   urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink

It's the 75th birthday of Anne Frank, who wrote the famous "Anne Frank's Diary", if she didn't die in the holocaust during the WWII.  She, just like you and me, loved to capture the particular shots in her daily life. Yet, in her time when the Nazi's terror was all around, her diary was not an collection of fear and tear. Instead, her story builds a tunnel of time that protect you from the bombardment and horrible sence, and guides you to her beautiful world. She has once said, "Nobody need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world." Life is short. Hers was even shorter that her family was betrayed and killed in the Nazi concentration camp in Bergen-Belsen in March 1945 when she was 16. While in memory of Anne Frank, I hope her diary can give us inspiration on our diaries.
This morning an old man came with a violin case. It's a Canadian case that he's just purchased from elsewhere. It looked elegant to me but was too heavy for him, who had a fragile wrist. He wanna get a lighter case and traded his. Well...it's a nice case, but we don't really need it. The old man was sad and whining. I felt sorry for that too. I then showed my sympathy by offering him a strap that might relieve some burden. It's not best option but he did show appreciation. Finally, after 15 mins trying and negotiation, he decided to buy a new lighter case and gave his case to us for discount. And the deal was made. We were both happy!   I miss you Honie...
Last night Rebecca and I had a promenade in downtown Palo Alto hoping to find a special wedding gift. Well...it's a nice walk as there were some interesting shops selling bizarre stuffs. The Border down there was fabulous one. The interior design and the atmosphere made you feel more like an intellect. Althought we didn't find anything good for a wedding gift, we found an incredible coffee shop. Since we both are big fans of Italian coffee, we were choosing the one hanging "illy's" logo and the one selling Torrefazione. We chose the latter, and it's proved to be a right choice. It looked good and tasted fantastic. Starbucks can never make coffee like that with firm and marble-like foam milk. I highly recommand this coffee shop on University Avenue!  Another great choice: Strada in Berkeley!
1. He had only one major publication. 2. It was in Hebrew. 3. It had no references. 4. It wasn't published in a refereed journal. 5. Some even doubt he wrote it by himself. 6. His cooperative efforts have been quite limited. 7. The scientific community has had a hard time replicating his results. 8.

urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink      This is a pastel drawing that I drew on Valentine day! As a "CHEAP" boyfriend, I didn't buy flower to Rebecca. I drew this picture for her as a substitute, which I believe be more longlasting. The flowers were indeed the gift for Sonlight teachers on Valentine day. But anyway I hope you'll like it!
urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink      Stanley is my favorite hang-out place in Hong Kong. The beach, the old market and the coffee shops...are the best place for a lazy afternoon!  During our HK trip in March, Rebecca and I revisited Stanley again. We walked around and passed an abandoned beach-side hut. This old and godforsaken hut somehow caught my attention and pulled my feet on that spot. No body live there now. But many years ago, there might have lived a family; kids played around and a swing hang on the tree. The happiness was all around that place. In this pastel painting, I intended to exaggerate the lifefulness by using many contradicting colors.  If you have a chance to walk around Stanley, look for this hut!!
This afternoon at 3:00pm when I was working, my supervisor in De Anza College called me asking me if I could go to help a woman who desperately n
