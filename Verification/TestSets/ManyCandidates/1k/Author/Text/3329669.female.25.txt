got up late 'again' today, I slept late because of 'Survivor All Starr Final Episode' hahha, slept abt 2 o'clock. I was kinda disgusted with the way, the juries handles themselves, they let their prejudice & bruised ego rules their speech/vote.   What la wehh... the Rob guy is a schemer(for goodness sake they are all are :P) and he did play competitively, he helped to build a nice shack of theirs back at 'Chapera', he played aggressively, during challenge be it in tribe, or personal challenge. At least, Shi-Ann is honest, in her speech.. hehe the SHE-Devil-ANN, hahahha....   Anyway, wanna search the web later, to check on Rob & Amber latest outgoing, are they married yet ??? Or the proposal thingy, is another scheme of their, to share the 1 Mill dollar together... hahhahah. But Amber is kinda cute, with some meat on her skinny bones. And Rob looks 'almost' boyish without his beard.  But frankly,  think Rob deserve to win.... I vote for ROBB !!! ... hahha

It's Friday again, and my blog already turns 1 week old, hooray.. Hooray,... hip hip hooray... !!  anyway, I got an invitation for a bbq Saturday nite. It is sorta like re-union gathering held by a schoolmate of mine, Dasrul.    it is a pot luck thingy, so I'm not sure on what to bring over though. Maybe just some can/pack drinks, easy ehh... Or some sausages/burger patty ?? What do you think...??
I'm kind busy today, my office just purchase a new video camera, as a replacement for the old one. The old digicam was stolen by someone, I have a rough idea who it is, but then again, I can't really prove it though.    the new video-cam is canon. been studying the manual the whole morning. hmm.. To much dials and setup (3 supported software for 1 single video-cam) ler I think.  hmm.... And the battery is a big failure, total recording time of 30 mins only.. duhh... What can we do, with battery that can last for only 30 mins. Gotta get an extra battery, just in case.  But the best part was, it can be a digicam, with a much highger zoom/close up that normal digicam. Well of course, it can't beat a SLR camera ler ....
i was browsing my computer tonite, deleting old files, re-arranging my lil bro files and everything. & i came across this raya photo. this is a photo of me & a few friends of mine, taken in azna'z house. This was during raya time, got makan-makan .. hehhee... the photo is off myself, nonie, sarah, azna & zee.

I have 2 fans here in my room, the ceiling & table fan, can't afford air conditioner though... very tempted to go to shopping mall, and sit down at starbucks and drink mocha frappuccino to the last drop...  im posting from my home today, thanks to my sweetie, who was so kind of him, fixing this PC for me.. love you lotsa.. lotsa.. lotsa... roza sayang.. hahaha, right now im listening to whenever, wherever, whatever song, by maxwell, makes me think so much of him.. ** sighh...
Yesterday was a terrible.. terrible nite for me. I went over to the airport (KLIA) to pick up some foreign workers. Yeahh.. Im working in a manufacturing sector, and most of the workers in production line are foreign workers(Indonesian).  Well, I tag along because they need a female companion for the new girls, cause my HR peeps are guys        So we started out the at 7.30pm, usually, it will only take about 45 mins to get to KLIA, but yesterday, it takes about 2 1/2 hr !! Why ?? There was a thunderstorm yesterday, after about 5-6 weeks of no rain.. and some part of the Highway was flooded, can you imagine that, highway.. flooded!! ** sighh.. so we have to make a few turn here & there, got diverted, only to found out, the next entrance to the highway is also flooded... Somehow, when we're trying to avoid the flooded area, we got lost(duhh..) So we stop at a nearby office building, and ask the security people over there, "HOW TO GET TO KLIA !"!, So the security guy, he guided us, all the way to the highway entrance, using the non-flooded route.. haiyaa... nasib baik ler...  At last, at 10.00pm, we manage to arrive at KLIA, and the flight already arrive for 1 1/2 hrs, kesian diorang lama tunggu. We did some medical( it is compulsory for foreign workers to undergo medical routine upon entering Malaysia )l, Immigration & custom clearance, all and all, we manage to finish it, at 12.30pm. Don't ask me why it takes s
