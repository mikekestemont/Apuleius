Another year, another Father's Day that will pass where I won't get to see my beautiful angel Arianna.  You see I am the father of a beautiful 2 yr old, but her mother, who seems to have this weird vendetta against me, refuses to let me see her.  Now I have the court papers that show I have joint custody and my visitation rights are listed as well.  But the last time I actually seen my beloved daughter, she was roughly 15 months.  Now many are probably asking why is this happening to you?  Are you a dead-beat dad who don't pay child support or medical insurace? NO!  Do you make an effort to call and try and see her?  YES!  I don't know why her mother is doing this to me...I don't even understand why this is happening to me.  I feel I've suffered enough.  Let me explain:  I was raised in the projects of Brooklyn.  My family broken and broke, my father had a new wife, a new life & a soon to be new family.  I am the first born out of 6!(2 from his 1st marriage and 4 from the second)  I am named after the bastard and yet, to this day, I am still fighting (somewhat) for my father's attention.  He bestowed upon me a gift I would not trade in for anything in the world, the gift of art!  I was born an artist and I will die an artist...that's my motto.  Since I could remember, I always placed my dad on a pedestal.  He was GOD to me, literally, I mean this man could do no wrong.  But yet, he refused to pay child support, he made promises he NEVER kept & he just forgot me & my brother existed.  As the years passed on, it was still hard for me to "let go" of my father & whenever he forgot us, I rebelled against the one person who TRULY loved me.  I became cold, I shut out the world & I refused to care about anything. I can still remember the day me & my bro stood waiting by the window for my father from 8am to 10pm!  Well I was still awake, my brother cried himself to sleep (in my arms).  My moms weeped for us as well & it killed her to see me just sitting there, cold, meticulously waiting for a person she knew was not going to show up.  I was angry at the world & at GOD because I knew I loved someone who will never love me the way I loved them.  I remember the invites I sent for my various achievements: public school, junior high school, high school graduations, etc. & looking out to see an empty chair each & everytime.  It hurts & still burns to this very day.    But on February 26, 2001 all that changed.  This was the day my beloved angel, my princess was born.  Mi renita, Arianna, my darling butterfly was born & the angels sounded their trumpets with jubilation (I swear).  After that day, my heart & soul was opened & repaired.  I knew I had a reason for living, I knew why life was so great!  Me & her mother even let our past be our past & realized that we BOTH need to be there for our daughter.(Or so I thought)  Things were going smoothly, me & my daughter were inseparable, me & her mother, however, was not seeing eye to eye on alot of things.  You see my daughter's mother (and I will keep her nameless....for now) has an overbearing mother.  Well we will call her a "spoiler", to this type of mother their children can do no wrong.  She already had planned out my daughter's next 5 yrs of her life & I will be damned if ANYONE tries to say what my daughter can & cannot do.(other than her mother or myself that is)  It's funny because, she didn't want me to take my daughter to Brooklyn to see my family, because as she said, "Brooklyn is too dirty & too ghetto for MY grandchild!"  Of course, the New Yorker/Brooklynite in me wanted to kick this bitch in the earlobe for her ignorance, but I maintained my composure & let it go.  Then came April 3, 2002, MY BIRTHDAY, the plan: my daughter's moms drops off our child to see her daddy on his birthday, my family comes to visit from NYC & all is happy since the fams gets to see the baby & I get to have my daughter (ALONE) on my birthday.  Shit, even my fams in Florida FLEW UP & came to see me and my angel.  Well I will ALWAYS remember this day as the end of the rest of my life, because this was the last time I have seen my child.  The day started out well, Arianna's mom came promptly at 7am to drop her off.  My fams showed up roughly about 12pm, and spent some much needed time with my daughter.  Then, the nightmare began, about 4pm I get a phone call from Arianna's mom & she is very upset.  I ask her what's wrong & she tells me she needs to pick up Arianna today & not tomorrow as planned.  Of course I am pissed & promptly ask her why, she doesn't answer, instead she hangs up the phone!  So here comes Arianna's mom all pissed & still refuses to explain to me why she is upset. (come to find out she was upset because a "good friend" of hers told her that my roommate was at my house when she really wasn't) I tried to calm Vi...oops almost let her name out! (evil grin) But I tried to calm her down to no avail and that was the last time I saw my angel.    I have pleaded with Arianna's mom, sent her letters, called non-stop (still do), emails & ims...NO RESPONSE.  Alot of people say I should just go there with the police since s
