Perhaps it would be beneficial to say something about myself, since I have subtitled this blog "The ramblings of a woman in her prime."  I have recently turned forty, and I am having some difficulty in coming to terms with that fact.  I don't mind getting older, per se, it's just that I don't  feel old.  You see, it took me until well into my thirties before I really grew comfortable with who I am.  I found the right job, the right mate, and I could not care less about what others think of me.  I have decided that other people should care more about what I think of them.  I am happy in my own skin, and it is very freeing.    I don't look forty, or at least that's what other people tell me.  I especially hear this from my students (I teach high school English), who often delight me with, "Gee, you're older than my mom, but you look and act younger."  I think this is largely due to the fact that I don't have any children of my own.  I tell my students that "I don't have someone like you sucking the life out of me at home."  I love my kids, but I also love that they go home to someone else.  Still, forty just seemed to come up and bitch-slap me.  I thought my life would be different than it is now.  I wanted to DO something with my life.  I think being a teacher is a great thing, but I always wanted to be a writer who wrote something meaningful.  I can come up with stories, but they seem pretty vapid to me.  Is it wrong to want to write something that will last, something that could change the lives of other people?  I can also see, by rereading this, that I will never be a good writer if I don't stay on topic.  I was going to say something about myself, but all I have said is that I am forty and I teach English.  Well, I am a woman, I live in the Midwest (or the "plain states", as others prefer), I have had several careers before I decided to become an English teacher.  After college I worked publishing newsletters for a trade association, became a lawyer, worked as an executive director of a non-profit organization, and THEN became an English teacher.  Of all the jobs I have had, I must say that being a teacher is the most personally rewarding, if not financially rewarding.  Besides my job, I love singing (it is my avocation), love movies, am addicted to television (particularly reality TV), read extensively, play computer games (the Sims), and am working on shedding some unwanted pounds.  I probably spend at least 20 hours per week on my computer doing one thing or another.  I am good at multi-tasking, otherwise I'd never get anything done.  As a person, I try very hard to be kind to others, especially young people.  I have little tolerance for much of the stupidity that I hear coming out of the mouths of adults, and I need to work harder on not rolling my eyes or just replying to them with some nasty retort.  I have found it isn't worth it.  I think I can be a funny person, and I do use sarcasm a great deal.  One administrator that I used to work with said that sarcasm should never be used in the classroom.  I guess I'll have to quit teaching, if that's the case.  My students know when I'm kidding, and I think they like me for not being the stereotypical teacher.  I have some weird quirks, one of them being that I tend to get obsessed over things or ideas and wrap myself in them for a period of time.  Right now, my obsession is the character Eomer from the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  I have a picture of him at school, as well as an action figure on my desk.  I refer to him as "my boyfriend."  My students think I'm insane.  Some of the boys get incensed and ask, "How can you call him your boyfriend?  What does your husband think?"  I tell them that my husband's girlfriend is Buffy the Vampire Slayer, so he has no room to talk.  I am getting tired of writing.  Is it the fact that I am out of practice, or is it the two margaritas I drank earlier?  Only time will tell...
I have finally given into the idea that I should write down my thoughts and musings, rather than just keep them in my head.  It amuses me that perhaps someone, somewhere would read them and think, "Damn! That is one savvy, yet slightly off-kilter woman.  I like the way she thinks!"    In reality, I just need some avenue to express myself, so this seems like the best way.  I aspire to be a writer, but I despise the physical act of writing.  Typing is much more satisfying, for some reason.  As an English teacher, I always encourage my students to write, yet I myself am abysmal about writing regularly.  I am hoping that this will force me to write, as I think there is nothing more pathetic than non-updated writings that just float around in the vast abyss of the internet.  So there you go...
I'm readying myself for a weekend away with five friends from high school.  We're "celebrating" the fact that we all turn 40 this year, although one of us will be 41 next week, and another won't be 40 until September.  Still, it's a wonderful reason to get away from spouses and kids to shop, eat, drink, and gossip for three days.  I marvel that I have been friends with these women for well over 25 years.  Anyway, among the trinkets I'm putting together for the weekend, I have created a three-CD set of music from our youth, and I'm burning copies for everyone.  I've found almost four hours of music that are truly "blasts from the past."  E
