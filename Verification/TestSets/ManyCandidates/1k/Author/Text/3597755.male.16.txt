Everything that's economily scarce has its price. Salary is the price for work. Money is the price for goods. Interest is the price for money. I think our commercial society has finally figured out the price for a human being. Propaganda.  Why do I write this? Yesterday I heard that my favourite radiochannel was probably to be kicked off the radio soon. The radiochannel I'm talking about, Kink FM, is in Holland the only channel that only plays modern alternative music. The only other channel who did that before as well is getting more and more mainstream. Why must Kink FM be kicked off the radio? Because they don't make enough money. They could better be swapped with yet another your-favorite-hits-channel. Another reason is the fact they play alternative music. Marketeers would find it great if alternative music was to be banned. Because then everybody will have to listen to mainstream music at some point. Then everybody will be a mindless zombie when it comes to music. They have turned half of the world already into hilary duff/britney spears/usher fans, the rest of the world will have to suffer that at some point as well.  There is something else about alternative music. It's free. It has a mind of its own. It breathes freedom. People who listen to it and appreciate it are likely to avoid the propaganda of the world. (listen to free*land - we want your soul) Commercial organisations don't want that. They want to have the opportunity to make everything EXTREME, everything has to be SUPER COOL and FANTASTIC. Because mindless zombies will get exited if they hear that the EXTREME, SUPER COOL AND FANTASTIC new hit-single of Aeger Avarus is available in stores NOW! But when they hear that the new single by Aeger Avarus is released they couldn't care less.  Back to more general, abstract terms. I have probably quoted fight club before about marketeers. "Marketeers makes us work jobs we don't want to buy shit we don't need." This is exactly my point. If it were up to marketeers we wouldn't have thoughts anymore. Marketeers are trying to make everything as futuristic as possible but at the same moment they want to pull back time 20 years. If it was up to me most marketeers could join the line behind mainstream music fans to talk to Pluto (people with the name Orpheus who like mainstream music can come for a nice talk to me). They make me sick. So tell em, dear marketeer, how many advertisements buy a human being?
Ok, I'm pissed off at the moment. I was asked by a friend to write some weekly piece about music. Ofcourse I accepted it with only one condition: I shall not be censured! He accepted my commands and the day after I wrote my first piece.   A week later I write my second piece, post it and watch if it is shown correct. But what does my eye spot? Censure. Correction: stupidly censured words. I asked him about it and he told me that he had made a list of words that were automatically censured. My blood is still boiling. When I read that, I knew that I should resign. Haven't done that yet though, will find out ways to insult people and judge shitty music without being censured. What I will do now is explain why censurement sucks.  There are different types of censurement. A summarisation follows: * Stupid censurement Removing words like shit and fuck makes people ignorant. Have you ever used the word fuck? I bet you did. Have you heard stories of people dying after they heard/read the word fuck? The only people who are against the use of those words are overconcerned parents and overprotected kids. The parents of those kids are criminals for puting such stupid kids in society. Your kid won't become a murderer after he has learned some cuss-words. As a matter of fact, if you allow them to use cuss words from a young age they won't be using cuss-words a lot at a later age. Just because they are familiar with them. They're not new to them. Those words just are. In my opinion words as 'shitty' and 'fucking' are perfect adjectives which should be allowed everywhere. Ofcourse, those adjectives don't say anything usefull about something but they can give somebody's opinion about something. If I talk about 'shitty music like Britney's music' I don't feel I have to explain why I hate Britney's music. At that moment I think it's enough to let people know I don't like Britney's music. And that's the way to do it.  * Stupid censurement: E.g. Fuck - F*ck This is the type of censure that was used on my article. F*ck is in no way less offensive than the real word (I believe Maddox used the exact same sentance but I don't care(or Zappa did)). I mean, if you want to protect six year old kids this definatly ain't the way to do it. Fuckers who are stupid enough to censure my fucking texts this shitty way are fucking ignorant wankers.  * Stupid censurement: MTV's censurement.  This is probably the worst censurement. The way MTV censures is terrible. I don't like MTV's music but I do like to watch to shows like alternative nation (though that isn't broadcasted anymore) and top 11 @ 11. But that's not what I was talking about. My problem with MTV is that they censure everything. In the USA MTV banned the video of Incubus' Megalomaniac to the evening hours because of...yeah because of what exactly? Because of images of Hitler? Are we on our way back to 1984 that much that we are trying to forget about Hitler?  Another example: junior/senior - everybody (I believe that was the title, not completely sure. I'm too perfect to know much about those shitty songs) Some squirrel drank four glasses of something fast. After that he was shown drunk. What does MTV add? "Non-alcoholic nut-juice". I guess that's what those dipshits at MTV drink. Nut-juice. O
