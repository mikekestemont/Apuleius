It's hard to come up with these clever titles.

Well this is pretty much it for the travel Blog. Peggy and I are heading home. We are in Murdo, SD. With any luck we'll be home late Thursday night, or Friday morning. We had a great time. I hope everybody enjoyed reading this blog and looking at the pictures. If you did, tell Bob Vasquez thanks. He loaned me his laptop which made it possible to get the pictures ready for publishing here. I posted about 36 pages of Blog updates. They averaged about 3 pictures a page. You do the math. Thanks to everybody for commenting. I get a email eveytime somebody posts a comment, so I've read every comment you guys have posted. Champion Blog Commenter Award goes too... Steve Crandall for the most comments. One last picture from Roughluck Falls. See you next week.
Here are some wild donkeys from Custer State Park    A couple of sheep.
Peggy had been wanting to see Mount Rushmore since grade school. Today was the day she finally got to see it.    The ongoing Crazy Horse monument is pretty close to Mt Rushmore, so we visited there next. Did you know the construction of this is privately funded?     Here is a model of the sculpture
Devil's Tower Legend There are several versions of this legend, but the go something like this.   According to a Kiowa legend, eight children once played here. One was mysteriously transformed into a bear. His seven sisters fled in fear across the eroded plains of northeastern Wyoming to a giant tree stump, which rose from the ground even as they tried to climb it. Clawing furiously, the bear tried to reach the girls but could not. The stump then turned to stone, preserving the giant gouges from the bear's claws. The sisters floated into the heavens, where they can be seen at night as seven bright stars.      There is quite a large parrie dog community around the tower. Peggy had quite a good time watching these crazy little guys.     We spen the night in Deadwood, SD. Rudy you'll be happy to know that local historians applaude the creators of Deadwood HBO for it's accuarcy. Also, did you know all the main characters were real people in Deadwood? We visited Wild Bill Hickocks Grave.
I posted about 7? pages today so have a good look around. We've spent the better part of 3 full days in Yellowstone. We spent last night in the Grand Tetons Park, and are sleeping closer to Jackson tonight. Tomorrow we start heading east and making our way slowly back home. We are having a great time. Keep the comments comming.
By request... Mountain pictures. It really hasn't been good mountain picture taking weather, with the gray skies and all, but here are a few pictures of the Tetons I took this morning.
Okay, everybody just settle down. I know you've been waiting for this report. Peggy assures me this was just fabulous. We got to Ralston just in time to see the mule parade. There were many different kinds of mules and riders. Don't worry, Peggy has the whole parade on tape. This is the biggest event of this type in the world. There were about 113 mules for auction, seminars, and a mule rodeo. You haven't lived until you've seen people trying to make mules barrel race. Here are some highlights.
Bob here are a couple of blurry waterfall pictures for you.       and finally, this confirms what we've suspected all along.
Okay, here we are in Yellowstone. Everything you have ever heard about the beauty of this place is true. Wildlife is everywhere, even in our campers village. We rented a cabin, and there was a pesky black bear that we seen a few times. One morning it was by the creek by our cabin. We watched a grizzly bear through binoculars, and seen three moose as well. Very exciting. About the only thing we didn't see were the wolves.    Old Faithful   Mamouth Springs area
It's not too hard to see black bears in Yellowstone here are a couple pictures.     And here is a Pronghorn. Did you know that they are not really antelope?
Here are a few wildflowers we spotted in Yellowstone.
This fox looks like he's been around awhile.   Here is a yellow bellied Marmot   And let's not forget the really small animals.
Plenty of Elk to see in Yellowstone
Kelly, here are some stinky buffalo.
As soon as I finish this post Peggy and I head on to Yellowstone. We are in Bozeman, Montana right now at a Kinko's Copy center. We had a greta day in Bannack State park, Nevada City, and Virginia City All forming gold mining towns. There has been a lot of questions about the animals in the Tripple D posts. This animals are still very wild. They can be handled by their handler, but he has the utmost respect for them. It's not like they train them to sit and beg or something like that, but they are trained enough so that they to have some respect for the handeler. Then they take the animals out to some natural setting and turn them lose basically. I was standing in front of a 3 feet high chicken wire fence when I shot that Tiger. Pretty exciting really.  Peggy is seeing lots of mules and is looking forward to mule days on Saturday.  Well I better hit the road. Thanks to whoever took the time to help Wilbur look at this blog. I know what you went through. I am sorry.  Thanks for all the comments. -Ric & Peggy
Nevada city takes a different Approach. Most of their buildings have displays in them, and some of the buildings where moved here fom differnt locations. Another great ghost town
Bannack was one of the wildest of the wild West towns in Montana. Today it is a state park. They preserve the buildings, but don't make any attempt to restore them. It is a cool place. Here are some pics
This is probably the l
