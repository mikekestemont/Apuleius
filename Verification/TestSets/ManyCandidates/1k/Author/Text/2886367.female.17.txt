You say I'm a dreamer..    I feel so torn up inside. I feel as though I could curl up in a corner and just break down, and cry until life leaves my body but I don't, I can't, that's one controlled thing I just can't let happen, because I don't know if I would be able to make myself stop. I don't know what to think or say anymore. I don't know what emotions I'm feeling half the time that I'm feeling anything, and I don't know what to think about it. I'm afraid of sitting back and letting things happen and passing up the chance to make even a slight impact on how my life will run its course. I'm afraid of giving up.  But at the same time I'm afraid of sitting here in this white noise, with no direction at all, and waiting for something to hit me in the face.   Kind of like standing on a lonely corner beneath the musty light of a street lamp at 3am in a downpour, with the occasional car driving by.  Or like sitting in grandmum's attic after she died, lissening to oldies on her radio and watching the sun sink behind the hills through the dusty windowpanes, and being the sole person in the house.  Or sitting atop a very large hill and watching civilization crawl by without you, with everyone running around everywhere like frenzied ants, and you're perfectly still, just watching it all.  Or that you're walking down a congested hallway in school, but you're not "actually" there, and everyone just kind of warps around you as you make your way down the tunnel.. never really acknowledging you, never bumping into you.. just kind of merging almost liquid-like around you. You don't hear any noise, but you see everything. Like it's all in slow motion. Like the vision is sometimes slowly and sometimes fast spinning around you, and someone's got the remote and they're hitting the pause button and the fast-forward button at random intervals for random amounts of time. Like you're never facing the same direction for more then a few moments, and will never face that same exact direction again, because you're always being pushed to face something new.  I want to escape it all but at the same time I don't, I'm curious, and I want to figure it out. If I escape it will be like giving up. I don't want to give up. I want to finish school, and become a cartoonist/animator, and do all these other things.   I don't want to drive metal into my arms 'till they bleed, or go back to the hospital and sit in the sickeningly sterile white rooms and talk to the annoying clipboard people.   Its like everything's surreal. Like none of it's really happening.. but at the same time everything's moving so fast, everything's so painfully real that you've got to give it everything you've got to keep up and not be left behind.  I don't know.. I should probably sleep.. if there was one sole thing I would change about me, ever at all in the whole world in my whole lifetime, I'd get rid of the nightmares. That would be the one thing I could live happily without, and never regret, and never think back and say "Well I could learn from them so.. ".. but they're there, and they're going to stay there for as long as they like.   Wish I had someone to talk to but at the same time, I don't know what I would say. -.-  To whoever said I could call them whenever, or whatever you said, I thank you but I feel horridly disgustingly bad about calling people at 3am.. it just kinda makes me cringe [in other words, I'll probly never ever call anyone at 3am]. Thanks anyways.
Shyin' away..    current music: [forgot the band] - take on me current mood: seething, stunned, meh  I don't deal with silence very well. If we're driving in a car, and there's absolute silence.. no music.. no nothing, I spaz. I just can't do it. I don't deal with friends hurting themselves and frying their brains very well either, or using such methods as "escapes." I can't really say much against it, though, because I chopped my hands up pretty good myself, but I can't just sit back and watch it happen and not say anything. Even if it makes me something of a hypocrite.  When they sit there and say "No its okay, I don't want help just more alchohol" I'm highly tempted to go ram my fist into their face. Alcohol is a sad escape. If you want to go get drunk off your ass, heave your guts up every morning and really insist on turning yourself into a brainless, liquor-addicted zombie.. just dont fucking apologize, unless you really intend to change your ways.. apologies mean nothing if you just say them out of the blue.  It makes me incredibly frustrated trying to turn someone away from that.   But its your life. Its your health. And its your choice.   It just drives me insane sitting back and watching it all.
"You forgot again, didn't you?"   current music: anastasia - in the dark of the night current mood: wanderlust, restless, dejected  Methinks it hurt less when I was single then when I was in a relationship at all.. I'm starting to wonder if I should even bother trying anymore, to get people to acknowledge that I'm alive somewhere and still kicking.   As for now I'm gona go bike down to the cemetary I think.. tomarrow I might sit on bart all day and see where it goes. Just gotta give myself that extra kick in the end and poke my mind so I get off and go home, and not end up in some random remote location like last time, heh.  Ah, well..
One of my fav. songs..     Hold Me Now   I have a picture pinned to my wall An image of you and of me and we're laughing With love a
