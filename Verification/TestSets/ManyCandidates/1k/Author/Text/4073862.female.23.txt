this morning i woke up at 11:30am or so.  younok's cleaning lady was here and she was super nice too...i should just say that EVERY person i have met is incredibly nice and helpful and i'm sure every person will be so i don't have to type that anymore.  anyhow, youngok and i have bad jet lag, so we just lazed around for a while then went grocery shopping.  there is a new beautiful grocery center with a nice food court and starbucks right by her condo...instead of having super high aisles with huge boxes of food, they have like 6 foot ailses made of black wire, kind of like closet organizers and on these shelves are small bags of noodles, sauces, everything.  it's really cute actually!  and they have so many free samples!!  i love it here!  i bought some food and youngok and i ate some really good chinese food at the food court.  where she lives is comparable to the gold coast in chicago, so everything is kind of expensive but very nice and clean and new!  then we came back and lazed around some more and ate some fancy cakes we bought at that bakery where i dropped the tongs.  they had free samples too...i learned that free samples are kind of universal, no matter where you are in the world, you can still understand what is a free sample and what isn't...but the used toothpicks aren't thrown away, instead they are put in a small tray right next to the fresh ones.  one is in red writing and one is in black...i just have to remember which is which when i'm on my own...oh well..i'll remember later.  thanks for reading!
i was so tired on this flight...i sat next to a really nice man who was from canada on business and told me how i should get into stock anaylsis because then i could travel...pretty good idea i thought.  to bad i forgot math and hate to read.  this flight had the best food, sushi!  and you know, i probably should have questioned all raw fish that i ate, but since my stomach was okay from that other sushi in tokyo, i thought i would be fine.  you can't have fun unless you try i think!  or get sick... hey!  youngok's mother just brought me yello melon...it's like honey dew and cantelope mixed together and looks like a giant cucumber.  anyhow, i slept hard core on this flight and woke up to the painful pressure in my forehead from the landing...i'm sensitive to change in pressure for some reason...but it's fine when i land, so no big deal.  anyway, i got off the plane and waited in a HUGE line for customs...i was glad at this point that i had already gone through all that trouble before becasue i got into korea with no problem...ha ha, suckers...just kidding, i'll probably get deported next month...  and there waiting for me was the very kind and generous J.H. Kim, youngok's father!  he held a sign on it with my name, i've ALWAYS wanted to be in that situation!  he already knew about my luggage problem and said it would all be taken care of.  we got into an SUV and he drove me to his beautiful condo.  youngok and her mother and father live in an awesome condo!!  it has all hardwood floors, 2 bedrooms and a master bedroom, 2 baths, a spacious living room, wonderful high tech kitchen with a flat stove, and a closed in balcony that stretches the length of the condo.    he gave me the tour of the condo and offered me anything i wanted to eat or drink or watch tv...but i just crashed on my bed.  i was exhausted.  J.H. Kim went to work and i slept.  he came back in an hour and him and i went to another airport in seoul to pick up youngok and get my luggage.  before we left youngok's mother (who is so nice too) made a little bag up for me with juice and snacks in it.  then J.H. Kim took me to this pastery shop to get some bread to eat.  this was the best bread i've ever eaten in my life!    i slept on the carride to the airport and totally drooled on myself.  oh yeah, i also totally dropped these tongs to grab the bread with at the bakery, i was a mess.  at the airport, which was clean and beautiful and high tech, we got my luggage and picked up youngok.  i was so excited to see her!  we came back and her sister met up with us to help us carry our luggage to the condo and unpack.  her sister helped me unpack every single thing!  she was so nice and funny too...youngok's family is just wonderful!  that night i completely crashed again.
my friend Yusaku Toh, from film school, met me at airport and i was SO GLAD that he did...japan was really confusing and not that many people speak english like they do here in korea.  so we met up and he walked with me to my free shuttle to my hotel, the Sky Court.  we rode there together and do you know what?  they drive on the other side of the rode like europe, but in korea they drive on the side like in america...wierd huh?  but i was bizarre and so many times i thought we were going to get into an accidet becasue we were on the "wrong side" of the road.  the sky court was nice but SO SMALL!!  not necessarily the cubical i imagined, but it was about 9x9 feet.  all it fit was my bed, a dresser and a bathroom!  it was so cute and actually, my size!  i actually felt of normal height in japan, it was nice.  it was also cool to keep up on the olympics...i noticed that now only the japanese competitors were being covered by the news and there were some pretty awesome japanese athlets, like the girl w
