Welcome to my blog!   So this is something new to try... I've never heard of blogs, but my pal Laurie has one, and it looked kinda neat. So here I am.  Well, I guess there's not better place to start than today! So far, I've woke up very groggy, came to work... and that's all. I actually got a front row parking space, which never happens. So something must be going right.   Today should be a pretty easy day. Especially as far as classes go. I've only got chamber winds and band. Wee! So yeah, it shall be fun.   I'm getting all geared up for my senior recital. Maybe I'm a little too excited about it, since it isn't until March? I've already heard some negative comments from people and from behind my back about what I'm doing. But, you know what? This recital isn't for them. It's for me! It's the payoff of over 10 years of practice and dedication to my art. It's for everyone and everything that has helped or influenced me along the way... so if they think it's dumb to play six instruments and spin flags... they can stay at home and watch TV. *tosses hair*  I FINALLY heard back from Ratcliff at Alma. He really liked my piece! He is supposed to let me know closer to May if they will be able to perform it. It would be my own world premiere! Exciting eh? I think so.  I dunno much else I guess. I'm not looking forward to band... we are doing another cheesy patriotic big american flag song to "break up the monotony of the show". Can't wait (sarcasm). I just hope those dang clarinets memorize their music for once. I can't say much b/c I'm not the section leader. But, I can give mean faces and look pissy better than anyone I know!   I maybe going to J'boro this weekend to visit someone special. :)  I really hope I get to. We will see...   Well I hope I did an okay job on my first BLOG! I guess that is it for now... time to go back to passing out headphones... haha.   P.S. Sarah Mclachlan new CD out TODAY!!!  urlLink
Ahh Spring!  It's the end of spring break :(  Oh well. I had fun. It was good to get away from here for a bit... I was becoming static. I left last Friday for Fort and had my usual Chili's date with Court. We have too much fun! I love it. I had an electric lemonade yuuuum yum. Then we watched some lame reality contest "Playing it Straight" or whatever. Her dog Ellie loves me so much! Who can blame her?  Saturday I went out to eat with my sis. Court and I hung out again too, just drivin around the big city. It was a nice relaxing day. (But gloomy) Then Sunday I went out to the grandparents house in Lavaca. It was such an awesome day. The weather was perfecto. I love spring so much.. I just can't explain how it makes me feel.   Monday I woke up at 6a and left for Dallas with Seth, Rachel, and Court. It was a fun trip! The weather was weird, but never got it was alright. We saw the big buildings and whatnot.. every town in Texas has Chili's and Target. WHATS UP WITH THAT!? I love it. Plus I saw two roads named after me and tons of those "Ross Dress for Less" stores. I think it wa a sign I need to move. ANYWAY, the rides at six flags are scary and I didnt ride much. It was fun anyway. We got back a little after midnight.. LOOONG day.  Tuesday I got my hair chopped off again! It had been since Nov. Crazy... Then Wednesday I went to Tulsa w/the parents. We went to the biiiig aquarium thingy in Jenks.. it was so cool. Around Thursday I was ready to pack up and come back to RussVegas though. And now its Friday. No plans, but I'm not that worried about it. Just gonna soak up the rest of the break.   Silence and quiet again in my life. Ciao for now.
Well, it's March. Oops. I guess I should update on the past three or four months, huh?   Marching season is over, it was a bust. I loved the drill, but the music was annoying after a few performances. It was my last time to march with the ATU band. I've come so far since that first show. I never thought I could do it. I know one thing is for sure, UCA, HSU, UofA, and ASU never come close to accomplishing what we do. No one marches like us, no one sounds like us.. and they never will. Our colorguard was an embarassment this year, but thats because it is turning into 13th grade spinning for Russellville High School. Maybe it will turn around again some day. I can't decide if I'm happy or sad about it being over. I have a ton of memories from each season. And put it a ton of time and effort. For all that work the ending was pretty plain and dull. OH well.   Senior recital has been postponed until April 7th, which is a good thing. The ensemble is going to be like nothing anyone has done here. We've had so much fun practicing it, and I still get goosebumps when I hear anyone play something I've written. It's like a part of me comes alive. Something I dug out of my soul gets to be heard! It's very exciting. Plus there are alot of laughs with it too.  Well, I didn't go to Jboro that weekend in November. But something told me to just go for it on the 22nd. I had a pep band game that night and it wasn't over until about 9 or something. I thought about going the whole time I was there, then called Court and she talked me into it! I went with no clue what I w
