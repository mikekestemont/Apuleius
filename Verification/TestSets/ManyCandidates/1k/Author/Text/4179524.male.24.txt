Well actually it should say Rude Boyz! But I was in the mood for a Duran Duran reference.  Friday is finally here and I'm a bit poste. Went to fire in Vauxhall last night for Rude Boyz (basically it's a night for lads who like hackett tops, trackie bottoms etc). Had a great time. Much of which is either unprintable or would land me in jail (alledgedly). It's a really good horny night with top tunes and top totty. Although the ametuer scally strip thing was a bit like Blind Date with Burberry...  So whats up this weekend? Well I think S'wellen's dragging me into town for a beer tomorrow *hic*. And that's about as far as my plans go.  7 days from now I'll be in Manchester - LA LA LA  Great weekend Y'all!  Mike x
I'm soooooo excited cos It's a week and two days til I'll be up in my spiritual home for the weekend (No not Grimsby). MANCHESTER!  Yes that city of cities. Home to the Stone Roses, the Early Nineties club scene, Queer as Folk, Coronation Street (best soap ever!), and of course Bridget Madeline Aherne. Who? I hear you ask. Well Old Ma Aherne is one of my very very closest friends, we've seen each other through thick and thin, had huge screaming rows in the street that always end when one of us cracks up after not talking for about 15 minutes, worshipped cheap wine together, lived, laughed (usually at each others questionable shags) and cried with each other since UNI and have a bond that can never be broken.  Ok enough with the gushy stuff, next Friday Manchester Mardi Gras starts, and I'm tying it in with a visit to Ma. she's probably worried cos she hasn't seen me since Feb that I'm not eating properly or something. Am also so looking forward to seeing Chris 'Mophead' Marshall (B's other half and as cunning as me on the old 'Slack around in life but still fall on your feet' Stakes). And Young Philip Leijiten (OZ Phil). Young Philip left London town for the bright lights of Manchester were he was found wandering by Ma and taken under her wing. From what I gather he's survived his first experience of her PMT, so whoring round Canal Street every night should be Knats Piss.  Okay for those not in the know, hear are the top 10 reasons you should revere Manchester as a city among cities;  1) It's the UKs second city - That's pretty damn good!  2) It's only 40 mins from Huddersfield, and less than an hour from Leeds, which made my university years so much more fun than just having Wakefield nearby  3) It has some of the most stunning industrial age architecture in the country. Take a look at some of the Uni buildings to see what I mean, and the G-Mex (Old train station)  4)Madchester - Need I say more?  5)The Hacienda and the whole of rave culture exploded out of this city and refused to die. Pity they're building flats there now to sell to the same people that used to club there.  6)Man Utd - Ok I'm not a football fan, but they did rule the roost throughout the nineties to become the most famous football team in the world! Plus It gave us a lot to ogle at!  7)Canal Street - It's like Soho, only the people are friendly and don't try and screw each other over. The night of soooo many drunken staggerings, mashed up clubbings, karaoke at Churchills, convincing bouncers we are actually a 'gay majority group' and taking over piano bars wherever we can find them.  8) The New Union - Ok it's part of canal street but It ROCKS. Where else in the country can you stand with a can of red stripe wearing sports kit and actually get the attention of the fit guys? Also home to random Irish drunks, people with dogs, and strippers that strip to 'Rock me Amadeus'.  9) Metrolink - It's a tram, but it's so much more! Takes you all the way to the Lowry and Salford quays. And it has crazy named stations like 'Pomona' and 'Shudehill'.  10) Last but by no means least - The Mancunian Way. To some it's just a road. But to the ones that built it it's a symbol of toil and achievement. Pretty much sums Manchester up.
Happy monday everyone - Todays title is a Darren Hayes reference. More on that later!  Am thankfully and miraculously feeling fresh as a daisy dispite my packed weekend:   Friday  - Met Sue Ellen for drinks after work with all his media luvvie friends, then we went to the ever gorgeous Lynettes for a dinner party (Read:got drunk as skunks, totally mashed up, and danced on the window ledge for the amusement of Brixton bus station, followed by us collapsing and Glinda humping the sofa in her sleep.) We also saw some junkies in Brixton shooting up - my first addicts! But the evening was fantastic and the lady deserves a gold medal in hostessing.   Saturday  - Woke up bloody early due to the beast that is the Brixton clock. Couldn't move until we'd had at least two cups of tea (which we sent Glinda off to do, best to keep her in her place) and a generous helping of Tarte au Citron (Home baked by Sue-Ellen of course. I always knew she'd use her GCSE Home economics one day). Then went home and monged in front of UK Golds Bill weekend for a bit, it was much better when it was half an hour long. This was deftly followed by a jaunt into town to meet my mates Ian, Derv and Warren and go drinking (which we did with gusto). Ended up in Bar Code Via Shinky Shonky and then back at Dervs house for a chill. Saturday then blurred into...   Sunday  - We got home from being out at 9:30 am, Glinda appeared around the same time with three clicks of her Ruby S
