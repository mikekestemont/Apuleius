hola... ok right now, it's 1215 am on wednesday the 30th of june. i'm totally pathetic because i can't sleep and i snuck out of bed to use the net so yeah, i'm crazy too....( the drama-mama is so going to get eyebags soon!) anyway, yesterday, the 29th of june, the queen went to school for drama rehearsal.( i mean, me )ms has busted me. when i reached school, she sms-ed to say that she's on MC. eddee, the usual bloke, went MIA. couldn't find him. stupid you-know-who went off without telling me with her pscyho-sttalker boyfriend!!! (B****) ( hee....)so there were only amirah, donna, charmer and myself. it was quite fun actually. we went to the AVA room where we practised singing. ( hell, we practised using songs NOT related to our musical! i'm going to be so screwed!) charmer and i had a ball of a time! (ball??!!!) ha ha ha! he sang several songs to me though.( ok, actually he sang several songs and looked  at me all the time. ) man! he's a BOY! a BOY!!! damn it.... he got kind of 'pissed' when he overheard me telling my donna that i met this cute leon. (????) then, for no rhyme or reason, he called keith something which i can't remember.( apparently, i only understand english...) ha ha ha! the funny thing is, i immediately laughed when he dedicated his next song to keith as a form of apology cause he thought i was pissed! so funny! he and i got into several mini 'verbal warfare' with one another and the wierd thing was, he wanted me to be there and listen to him sing hoobastank's "the reason". i couldn't ,of course, because  it was keith's theme song. (!!!) when i went outside, charmer didn't sing it.... that's really wierd.... i mean i'm not saying he likes me or anything! (oh please, i may be thick-skinned and dramatic but i'm not THAT thick or anything...) plus, i don't think we complement each other. there's no....chemistry. it's just a form of crazy, childish infatuation on my part.....(see, keith? now, you know how lonely i really am...) besides, my bestfriends know that i don't fall for boys! i'm crazy for intellectual and artistic men! (can't seem to find them, except keith....)  man, i better keep my hormones in check....the trouble with being born with oestrogen and progesterone...sigh.......... the good thing is, the male species can be so easily  manipulated and freaked out with them....hee hee.... all hail MOTHER NATURE!
ok, the drama-mama went for her poly orientation at nyp today. i met up with jia yi at the mrt station and went to school together. (okay, i misjudged the time and ended up an hour early.) we went to this extremely cold theatre of the arts for several boring talks. the only thing i enjoyed was the emcee who is a cute eurasian hottie named leon from molecular biotechnology... hee hee hee! the drama-mama went havoc with infactuations today!!! anyway, i got into the first class , CP0401, which is like a prison number!! grrr.... so low-class! i met my classmates for the first time today. out of 26 people, there are only 5 malay-muslims including myself. of these 5, 3 are malay boys and the other 2 consists of myself and this very religious girl named TRINAS. she's really sweet and sporty. we hit it off immediately. the three boys and i didn't start talking until we all went for lunch as a class at the north canteen. there,they finally plucked up enough courage to ask for my name and then,( gasp!) ask how i did my hair! (???) i mean, it seems the drama-queen's hair of many bundles has become a kind of conversational piece of sorts. when i said it's natural,they kind of like gasp and then some of the jap-inspired chinese girls in  my class who i didn't talk to previously, started making conversation with me....(see the power of food??) so, yeah, i enjoyed myself with my new classmates. but the one thing i can't stand were the same questions many people asked me: "are you singaporean?", "are you malay?","are you a eurasian?".... etc... i was posed these questions even in the toilets!! grr.... when i got home, i went online and saw liam. he's finally back from his hollywood sexually-provocative holiday! JERK!!! i chatted with him for a while before he passed the conversation to keith. keith asked about my orientation even though i didn't really remind him about it. he said he remembered it from the first time i told him about it. so sweet..... i told him about everything and also stupidly about the hottie, leon. stupid me!!!! he got really quiet and i could sense that he was unhappy and disappointed. i immediately regretted it and apologized. he accepted my apologies but i know him too well.... he is still feeling sore about it. he said he will try to come down after his musical. somehow, i have the feeling that he wants to come down to nyp and see for himself how i am doing in poly...(gasp) i can't make him do that. sometimes, the things he doesn't know about will really help to shield him from a lot of pain.... it's not that i will cheat on him or anything. i mean, he means a lot to me and i love him so much. i rather be hurt by him than to hurt him..... oh woe is me...
ok, the drama-mama haven't been able to write in for quite some time because APPARENTLY i was banned from the computer due to the fact that i was hooked for long periods of time. but never mind, all is well and the drama queen is back in full force today... yesterday, saturday june 26th, i went out with my mom and younger bro to parkway where they got pissed with me because they said that i took them on a long shopping trip without buying anything...grrr....it's not that i don't want to g
