This game I found in an educational store, so that must mean it is boring, right? Well, the theme isn't the funnest in the world, but the game is actually pretty fun.  Each player is trying to set up a 10 day trip by walking, driving or flying. You can move to another state next to a state by walking. By driving, it allows you to skip one full state. Flying, is even better, allowing you to fly to different states of the same color as the airplane's color.  There is a lot of luck in playing this game. After each player takes cards one by one to fill their iternery (as I like to call it,) players take turns drawing a card from one of the 3 face up piles or the face down draw pile and then the card drawn is discarded into one of the 3 face up piles or takes the place of one of the days, and the card replaced gets put in one of the three discard piles. There always have to be a card in each face up discard pile, so if you take the last card from a pile, you must place the one you replace it with in the same pile.  How you set up your cards in the beginning is key to the game, since you can never move your cards during the game, except by placing a card you want to move onto the discard pile and hoping the other players don't cover it up before you can pick it up and put it on another day.  The game plays quickly and usually the hard part is getting the last state you need. It can get pretty competitve at times and you probably will have to change directions sometimes to get what you need.  I think this game fits well as a "filler game" and especially as an educational game for our youth. They'll much rather learn their states and capitals from this game than any other way.

When someone invents a boardgame, they should seek out  this game first (if they have not played it already) and then design a game that  meets the goals of this game.       &nbsp;    These goals include:      &nbsp;     1.   Playable with any number of  players (2-6*) (*6 players with the expansions)      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only is it playable with different  amount of players, but it is a complete and different experience with varying  players.      &nbsp;     2.   Easy to learn, simple to  teach      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It takes less than 5 minutes to teach  this game.      &nbsp;     3. Great amount of strategy      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the strategy level is high, it  only takes a game to fully understand the strategy involved in the  game.      &nbsp;     4. Different game every time you  play      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The game is never the same two games in  a row. It seems fresh every you play it.      &nbsp;     5. Players do not feel out of the game at any  time      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can change the outcome of the game  on the last turn and almost every turn you do something that is  important.      &nbsp;     6. The game moves at a good  pace      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turns usually are not very long and it  doesn't take long to see all of the different moves you can take in a  turn.    &nbsp;     7. The basic game costs&nbsp;$20 and the  expansions cost around $13      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't say much more than  that.    &nbsp;    So what do you do in Carcassonne? Each player uses the  tiles he&nbsp;or she has in their hand&nbsp;or the tile that they&nbsp;just drew  and plays it next to a tile that is already&nbsp;in play. Sounds easy enough?  The tricky part is the fact that a tile&nbsp;can have one or more of&nbsp;the  following:&nbsp;city, road, farm,&nbsp;and/or monastery.The tile played must  connect in all ways to the tile(s) is next to. That means all city parts must  match with city parts and the same for roads. Farms surround cities and roads  so&nbsp;the farm part&nbsp;must match up with the farm parts on the&nbsp;already  played tiles.&nbsp;After you play a&nbsp;tile you may play a follower on that  tile, on one of the parts previously stated. You can only play one follower per  tile.    &nbsp;    What do the followers do?&nbsp;Basically they show your  hold on the city, road, etc. When a city is completed (the walls surround the  city and there is no part of the city without walls) a player scores&nbsp;2  points&nbsp;per tile.) Normally another player cannot play a follower in that  city when you have one in it. A player can play a follower into another city and  connect the two cities together, therefore&nbsp;both of you gain points for both  cities. In fact, if a player cleverly&nbsp;adds more followers in a city than  any other player, he&nbsp;or she gets all the points for that city. Roads work  about the same, except that they are only one point per&nbsp;road and roads are  completed when both ends of the road go into a city, monastery or a crossing, or  if the road makes&nbsp;a complete circle.      &nbsp;    Monasteries&nbsp;only occupy one tile&nbsp;and are not any  bigger than that.&nbsp;Monasteries are completed when you completely  surround&nbsp;them with other tiles. You score one point for the monastery  and&nbsp;each tile surrounding it, which is a total of nine points if  you&nbsp;complete it. Farms are the most difficult to understand at first,  because they are hard to tell where they end.&nbsp;Roads, cities and  monasteries&nbsp;end&nbsp;all farmland.&nbsp;Farms are never completed.&nbsp;At  the end of the game, a player scores 4 points for every completed city that the  farm touches.      &nbsp;    Farms and roads follow the same rules for cities, where  you cannot place a follower in a farm&nbsp;or&nbsp;road that another player has  a follower in. The only way to share farms and roads is to&nbsp;use the same  technique as in&nbsp;cities,&nbsp;by making a new road and connecting to the  road another player has, and the same for farms.      &nbsp;    Y
