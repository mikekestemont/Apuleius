I'm mad. Madder than my last post.  Earlier today, I went to go see "Raising Helen." Everything was going fine until I realized halfway through the movie that I was drinking Coke. I have been in the process of several tests (blood, etc.) at Riley for over a year, and Coke voids one of the tests, the test that was due tomorrow morning, the same test that Mom had to schedule three months in advance for. That ruined the movie for me, knowing that Mom would have a fit. And she did. For those who don't know, I can't stand being screamed at. I cry. Yes, one of the only times I'll cry. And so I cried while my mother cussed me out with the "f-word" and various other 4-lettered words. I tried to not let it get to me, but knowing that it was my fault that I followed with my 3-year tradition of getting Freeze-Frame Cokes at the movies made it worse. I stayed in the bathroom and cried for 10 minutes straight, and when I got online and talked to Ash and Nat for awhile, she was still screaming from the bottom of the stairs.   I thought she was over the whole, "You can't go to California now" thing, but when I was packing for Cali just now, she said, "You look like it's a definite thing. It's not, especially with that test you just ----ed up."   Nat's upset. So am I. And I can't stand her using cuss words. There's a reason I've cussed once in my life, and that was when I was 2 and I was following her example. What a wonderful role model.   So there's the main story. I'm mad. And upset. And Ash isn't online and Jane's not home. Great.   And now I've ranted. Goodnight.  "Don't worry. There's more birds in the sea. Wait! I mean, fish in the sky..."
Well, I am feeling a bit better. Sorta. Not really. No. Never mind. Actually, now I am feeling quite stupid, and so I must apologize to Nathan for acting completely insane. (Sarah, you were right. I feel better now.) So, I'm sorry Nathan! Anyways... yeah. Wow, the whole thing has just hit me. I'm really feeling terrible now. I guess that I have been avoiding the issue for some time now, but now it's really hit me, and yeah. Although I know I'm not alone, I sure do feel so lonely. 'Tis a lonely Ashley, and I don't really think that there's anything anyone can do. You've all been really great though! Oh, and for Sarah and Evan (although I am not sure that he reads this) I ate a bit today, actually, a few minutes ago, and I'm feeling really sick again. Argh. And all it was was rice!!!  Yeah. Saturday was a bitter sweet day. Sarah and Evan did all they could to keep my mind off it. It worked for a while too. They were all concerned because I was eating. Ah well. That's what friends do. Sarah and I walked around Broadripple for a bit and then came home and waited for Evan by sitting outside in the grass and cooing at birds. (Or at least I was, lol)(See below) And so yeah. Then Evan came by and we all sat out in the grass for a longer time until they got really hungry and so we went inside and they made me eat. Then, they amused themselves, and me, by going through Sarah's books. That was funny. It ended with me being dropped off at home around 11. It was quite random, but it worked. Thanks guys!!!  Okay, quote time.  "Ex astris scientia" Think motto of something. (Bets are that either Jonah or Nathan will get this one. They'll actually be the only ones to get this one...but hey! That's okay!) It's worth only 100 points total for them, because I know that they know where it's from. 160 total (including whose motto it is) for everyone else! Scores: Alison: 480 Michael: 470 Olivia:160 Evan: (the most random player in this game) 160 Everyone else: 0 C'mon people!!! I guess that I should explain the new thing at hte bottom...... Well, you see, Sarah and I were sitting outside waiting on Evan on Saturday, and a dove came by. I was going, "Coo! Coo!" ANd it cooed back. And it started coming over, which became a whole, "Hey Ashley! The dove wants to date you!" thing with Sarah. Then, he flew away, and Sarah said:  "Don't worry. There's always more birds in the sea. Wait! I mean, fish in the sky! Argh..."
Crappy day. Crappy weekend. Crappy month.  Sorry about not blogging this weekend, but I was too busy with college parties/cookouts/tornadoes/visits with grandparents/a failed garage sale/etc. I'd rather not go into how much my parents lack in common sense. If I do, this entry will turn into a rant.  However, Saturday was the highlight of my summer thus far.  While the morning was a bit more serious and unexpected, from noon until around 11 P.M., it was a blast. :P Ashley went with me shopping in Broad Ripple, where I found my wonderful lil' Japanese sign that says "No smoking on bed," "Good night," and "Please keep valuables and other items in headstage." I love it!!! Ahhh... Random Asian objects are my specialty. :) We ate at Ben & Jerry's, returned home at 5 to talk to Evan and Nat (haha... she still has no idea who you are!), and then sat outside to wait for Evan to drop by. And he did. For several hours. What fun! (And we have yet to bake and name the walnut cookie! Unfortunately, I don't like walnuts, but I'll help you make 'em!)  That was the good part. Now my parents are talking about NOT going to California, even though we already bought the tickets, I'm half-packed, and Nat and I are already psyched. She's even trying to arrange a time when I can meet her new boyfriend. (Mark's cute, too! N
