No, fictional reader my room did no get blown up. We took a few casualties but they'll be OK. Most of them didn't end up needing to go to the hospital so that's good. I'm very tired. It's been another long and draining day, still not yeilding a paper on the ancient world. It's nearly finished and in my opinion very good. I wish I had someone I trust to take a look at it before I submit it.   I really wish I would have coppied my broadway CD's and taken them with me.
Ok, so God does answer prayers. No work tonight. My paper is coming along swimmingly. More mortars, yay. I hope my room didn't get blown up. I should go check. Talk to you later.
It's true, fictional reader still no fucking rest. I think the  Blackhawk-Six  has it in for  Outlaw-Six  . They've been running us ragged for like 28 hours and counting. I'm so dirty and tired, but strangly enough have the energy to come here and work on my paper. I should be done by 8am east coast time tomorrow, a day early to boot.   We had an interesting conversation at work about the girls of GI Joe and just what sort of underwear they sported. We all agreed The Baroness had sexy undies. I think Lady J wears really frumpy undies. We couldn't come to an agreement about Scarlet. I'm sure I'll come up with something. I hope dinner chow doesn't suck. I'm so fucking hungry. Yay mortars ! Gotta go.
I'm so tired. It's been a long night/morning at work and we're just back for a few hours before we have to work again. Last night was ok, we got what we came for just kinda a little more coarsely then I care for. I didn't think about her too much, which is pretty commonplace on long nights like the last one. Please, don't get me wring fictional reader, I'm not over her. I'm pretty sure I'll never be over her. Breakfast was adiquate. I snapped at soldier who was rude to me last night. Quite asertive, if I don't say so.   I've been considering gay marriage lately. Not my own of course, silly. But the concept in general I was at one time staunchly opposed to. Why? Maybe because I was told be, maybe because I felt obligated to oppose it for some reason. But I don't. How can we pass a law that targets and specifically excludes a demographic. We can't. Maybe I'm not so right wing after all. Conservative, just not ulta. I babble once again. I can't wait to finish off this paper.   My order from Amazon.com is on it's way I can't wait. It's  Liberty ! on DVD, I loved that documentary. It took letters from the period and had actors perform them. Very dramatic, I must say. I also got another copy of SP. Why would I do that you might ask, simple. This version is the encore recording with new singers and a new song, so fuck off. Georgetown Press also released a new Iraqi Arabic course with a solid dictionary and MP3 recordings. It's so hard the get the local accent down without listening. I also want the  Master and Commander  soundtrack and  Shrek 2 . Italics are cool, no?
It's been a week since I spoke with her. As I told you fictional reader she sent me the link to her site. No, you cannot see it. It's bad enough all her friends read about what I an asshole I am, I don't need you reading it either. Bah, who are you going to tell anyway. She sick, so she writes. Wish I could help somehow, but I don't think that's possible anyway. I can't be there all the time to help her. Not like she'd accept it anyway. Would she ?   I wrote to Kate today, I sounded like such an idiot. No, I'm not back from work, but I did have a few spare minutes so I took a walk up to the 1/37 MWR to check my mail. Surprise: No mail. Oh shit, I forgot to tell you. I have yahoo personal. Isn't that pathetic? Not only have I become a heart-on-my-sleeve net author, I also have a personal. The picture is older, I'm about 35 pounds heavier but I'm sure the future ex-Mrs. Andrews should get the idea.  I'm sure I'll be here to write more after work. Oh ? Maybe someone responded to my ad. Doubtful, but possible. Catch you later.
It's been pretty easy going today, but I'll have to work later on tonight. Oh well. I had a terrible dream about Kate last night. It was very disturbing. I'm happy she's not over here, one less trooper for me to worry about. She's fine in England, she's deploying some place cushy for a time, which should be good for her. Still have to write her and her mother back. I'm so bad about that sort of thing.  I know dear reader that last night's post was a bit depressing, but really I can draw no other conclusion on the matter. Maybe she never loved me the way I love her. It hurts to keep thinking about this, but I can't stop. *sigh* I still have to finish up this paper. It's due in a few days. My teacher says I can have an extension whenever I need it, which if these new rumors are true I most certainly may need. I should go. Write more after work.
Today was not much different from yesterday. I've been thinking about her non-stop. Rea is here from  COP: Blickenstaff  for some repairs and we've just spent the time reminiscing. He was there the night I broke it off with her. What a fucking mistake, wouldn't you say fictional reader?  I've been reading her blogg from time to time. The archives are especially skewed. If you've never been embarrassed in a public forum before, please take it from me; it is not pleasant. To be hurt s
