The the national media finally caught on to the  urlLink rampant corruption  that pervades Philadelphia's mayors office.  All I can say is, it's about freakin time.  The  urlLink WSJ  confirms Street's "Pay to Play", quid-pro-quo politics, funneling bribes through City Treasurer Corey Kemp, who "wanted four more years to do our thing".  (Picture a rapper-like thug pronouncing it "do our thaaang".  Street's goons epitomize race-baiting and political cronyism.    This past fall, I worked heavily on the Sam Katz election campaign.  Republican Sam Katz, a repeat contender and Ed Rendell's director of economic development, promised to bring new hope to a city in decay.  Though the cards were heavily stacked against Katz with over 3 to 1 Democrat to Republican ratio, in miraculous fashion Katz stood a fighting chance, early on.  It is common knowledge across the city that John Street has a histroy of shady dealings, malfeasance,  urlLink rote corruption , not to mention administrative ineptitude.  Democratic Mayor John Street, urban slumlord, is Philadelphia's modern day  urlLink Marion Berry .   Street's policies are keeping Philadelphia down, whereas DC, New York, and Boston are thriving.  Philadelphia, in decline, is losing population each year and hemorraging businesses, in part, thanks to an overbearing wage tax.    Election time rolled around and Katz was within range, when it became national news that the FBI was investigating Street for his suspected criminal involvement.    Then the unthinkable happened.  Race-baiter that he was, Street was able to demagogue the investigation, energizing Philadelphia's lockstep minority electorate to turn out for him like lemmings.  He misconstrued a legitimate investigation by the FBI as a racial witchhunt and a heavy-handed Republican power-grab.  What was even more deplorable, were the amount of outside money and political influence that were smuggled into the city to help a crook get re-elected.  Both Clintons, Gore, and and countless other Democratic operatives turned out to stoke the racial flames.  The whole ordeal was an utter travesty, but this renewed media attention and indictment of Street's treasurer serve to remind responsible Philadelphians of what they have known all along.  It was a shame that Sam Katz failed to remove this man from office.    Street won't stop until Philadelphia is driven into the ground.  Thanks to Street, the city could very well become the next Detroit 15 years from now.  And that's not all...Street's most egregious sin of all was driving Koch Fellow and Philadelphia native, David J. Healy, ostracized like a Palestinian, out of Philadelphia and across the cold, wintry, and polluted Delaware River, and into refuge in the trash refuses of New Jersey....
Knight Ridder is distributing an  urlLink article  about a GAO report which rather bleakly describes the situation in post-war Iraq. The headlines tend to sum it up as something like "Iraq is now worse off".  First of all, that is not a very accurate summary of the article itself. To say that Iraq is currently worse off in a few key areas is not at all to conclude that it is worse off  overall ; that holistic determination is quite difficult to make, especially when you're working with only a few statistics. The GAO doesn't make that conclusion, and neither should the headline writers.   But moreover, it seems to me that some of the statistics the report relies on are badly misused. The report claims, for example, that the Iraqi court system is more clogged now than before the war. Well, I imagine a country wouldn't have much of a problem with the courts being clogged if it was, you know, a  totalitarian dictatorship . If the reason the courts are clogged is that we're trying to give people due process, then maybe a little court-clogging ain't so bad.  I don't mean to downplay the bad news contained in the report or to suggest that we have done everything right in Iraq (we certainly haven't). I just want to caution against the glib use of statistics in deciding the complicated and important question of whether we've improved the lives of Iraqis.
John,  I concede that Ann Coulter is polarizing to people on the opposite side of the political spectrum.  I would add though that it is in part because she has been targeted by the left.  I would also re-emphasize that she is nowhere near as bad as Michael Moore.  As for your charge that she can not persuade, I would just venture the caveat that there are varying degrees of persuasion.  I think she can be persuasive, granted not as persuasive to novices, independents, and liberals, but definitely more so with people who are already somewhat conservative, or who have sort of inclination.    Furthermore, not everything that one writes should be held to some high-falutin standard of persuasion to be considered relevant.  Her writing also informs conservatives of issues, often political.  Note too that informing is another purpose that writing can serve.  Her writing also energizes some conservatives, which conservatives likely consider a favorable effect of her work.  What I see in Ann, on top of her writing ability, that makes her great are two things.   1) Her tenacity and assertiveness, contradict the seeming monopoly    on assertive, politically active women held by liberals.    (Conservative women on the whole are less confrontational than     liberals.  Of course, exceptions abound.)  2) I think conservatives need more emotionally involved people.  I    think that liberals do a better job of crusading for what they    believe.  Liberals also have more political stuff with an     entertainment component, and I agree with you that her work     does have entertainment value for some, myself included.  One criticism, is that I think it was wrong for you to bring up discussion of her weight.  Most people politics aside would agree, she is an attractive woman.  If we are ever going t
