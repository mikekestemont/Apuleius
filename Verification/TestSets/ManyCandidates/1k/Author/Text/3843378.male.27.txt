SEANS MOTIVATIONAL CORNER      "It is I" said the Sean.. Back in your face for our first writing of Seans Motivational Corner.. Today's motivation is going to be about positivity.. I know every tree hugging hippy and their mother is telling you "smile" or love one another. But it is true.. Going to the extreme may be just a little too much but you can still do your best to refrain from the negative. Take this example… Just today while driving to the library some guy in a corvette in front of me slammed on his breaks.. I almost hit him (the sun was glaring on his break lights so I didn't see them go off).. He got upset and flipped me the bird. I promptly waved at him and smiled… I could just see the look of embarrassment on his face as he was trying to figure out why the heck I was smiling (was he thinking that I knew him, that I had something planned for the corvette, etc)… That truly did make my day.. I'm sure it made his also. So back to the basics…always remember "You can do it".. That will carry you a long way…                      SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL BAND      Hey guys.. I have many friends with local bands and we must do our part to support them. Me and my crew are going to see Rock Star Club next   Friday August 6th at the Double Door  .. Be there or be queer… Click link below for more details.   urlLink http://www.rockstarclub.com/                 THE LOST PHENONEM OF THE REPRESSED DISC JOCKEY'S      A very strange thing happened after work on Saturday. Our office (for DJ's) has about a staff of 20+ dj's that goes out every Saturday evening to ROCK the suburbs. When we returned from our jobs last Saturday all of our frustration's came to a hilt.. We ripped our shirts off, broke a bunch of glowsticks and donned hats to become the village people and dance the YMCA. That is true.. You are reading that right.. The YMCA is a song we have played 2-3 times a week, every week for the past 6 years (in some cases 10+ years) of our lives.. Yet we were compelled to dress up and BE the village people.. Much like drag queens like to impersonate women, we impersonated the VILLAGE PEOPLE… ahhh… and it felt oooo sooooo good.. I was meant to be a Village Person. And I am OK with that… WHAT A GREAT TIME TO BE ALIVE !!!              <> POLITICS           I promise that I will keep the political chatter to a MINIMUM.. We all have vastly different political views and I respect that... What I don't respect is people that DONT VOTE.. It is soooo damn easy now with the internet.. All you have to do is goto  urlLink www.rockthevote.com , and it will have ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS for you. Do this and have a say in how they run your future..                  Stay Tuned for the next episode……      fin
TODAY'S FEATURE                As most of you know I am a disc jockey. (hence the name dj excitement)… I work through a larger company known at "Show On The Road Productions" (www.showontheroad.com).. We are ranked one of the ten best dj companies in the nation on a consistent basis, and we are the   Chicago   area's #1 dj company.. One of the things we are known for doing is our innovative request taking. When we are djing a wedding during dinner we will go to every guest in the wedding at their tables to take their requests… I have done over 300+ shows which equals over 5000 requests that I have taken in my tenure as a DJ.. I've decided to go through my memory bank's and list the most offbeat song requests I have received…. Keep in mind, this is for a wedding.. YMCA and the Electric Slide are the type of music that get people up and dance.. Stuff like Metallica and Korn is just going to rip the elderly people (usually 1/4 of the attendee's) at weddings into a frenzy.. Weddings are a funny thing.. The cheesier the better, the cooler the more BORED everybody seems to get.. A great example is everybody continues to make Vanilla Ice jokes.. But as soon as I throw down "Ice Ice Baby" everybody and their grandma is "Rollin' in their 5.0's With their ragtop's down so their hair can blow"… TO THE LIST!              TOP TEN INANE SONG REQUEST'S AT WEDDINGS               10. Can you turn it down I can't hear myself talk :  I know, this isn't a song request. But I had to put this in here. People literally spend thousands of dollars on these weddings and hire a DJ to put on a 2-3 hour show at the end of it. All elderly people seem to do is find our speakers. Sit next to them, and try to hold conversations while I'm trying to get people to dance. Why can't the old people go in the lobby? Why didn't they talk during dinner when it was quiet.. They are 80 years old? Haven't they talked to these people around them enough in 80 years? Just what have they been doing? aRrrghhh.. I'm rambling..                 9. Quoting the first couple lyrics rather then the song title :  To stupid people "You Shook Me All Night Long" = "She was a mean machine", or "Can't Help Falling In Love With You" = "Wiseman say why do…" or "American Pie" = "A long long time ago", I regress… Err I mean, civilization has regressed              8. Ewan Macgregor/Jennifer Lopez/Keanu Reeves/Jennifer Love Hewitt/Kirsten Dunst/Bruce Willis/Russel Crowe :  I thought these people were actors?? Who would have thought Ed Murphy's "Party all the Time" would have inspired everyone to release solo albums.                 7. Bon Jovi :  This is usually a normal request… FOR WHITE PEOPLE… If you are not white you have no business liking Bon Jovi… On that matter… I do not consider myself white so I too will not be requesting Bon Jovi anytime soon..                 6. Slayer :
