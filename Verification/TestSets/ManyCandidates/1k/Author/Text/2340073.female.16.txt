La La La! I'm back from Thanksgiving at my grandma's.   Trevor asked me to Christmas at his grandma's house. It's about two hours away and we'd probably have to stay the night. Is that strange? My mom, of course, isn't too keen on the idea. We'dd be in separate rooms and we won't do anything.  We did hold hands tho. *smile*   Do you think I should be able to go to Trevor's grandma's for Christmas?  BTW, It's their family Christmas celebration but it's on the 13th of December, so I wouldn't miss my own celebration.
Hooray! But still crap. I missed school today cause I was too dizzy to stand and walk. I don't have a fever anymore, and I don't know why I did in the first place. But I'm still going to my boyfriend's school's last football game of the season, or post-season or whatever. It's a playoff game. He's on the football team but he won't be playing. I'm still going, I guess to see him stand there. That is if I can stand. I didn't tell him I missed school today but only because he didn't have time to talk at all. I think he was calling from football practice. That's gotta suck. But his mom was at first supposed to pick me up, and buy my ticket, and sit with me. Now she's only sitting with me because she's getting there late and can't pick me up. Remember, I don't go to this school, I really don't know anyone and I'm still going. I'll probably sit with some people that I met at his church last Wednesday, but of course I have to find them. Oh yeah, and I have to try to stay standing, literally. Still, I'm going. I know there's really nothing he can do about this... at all. I really don't blame him, I want to see him. I just hope if I fall someone can catch me, if he's not right there. That's all for today. I have to go to the football game.
Damn it. I just lost my post. Damn it.   So here's the story again. For the second time. I was almost done too.   I talk ed to my boyfriend's sister last night. I was negotiating his online time, you know cause she controls the computer. Not saying that's a bad thing; I control the computer at my hosue and I "allow" my brother to use it every once in a while. So I'm trying to appeal to her... sisterly senses. Not working tho. She's a year older than me. My boyfriend's two years older. Kinda scared my mom... anyway, I digress. So she's like "I'm older and you're... stupid," or something that meant that. And I was like "Yeah, you're older but you wouldn't know it." Sadly she didn't catch the insult. Just proves my point. So she hates me. But I blocked her so we're even. And then she got off and Trevor got on. *smile* So we talked. I went to his church yesterday too, as I have... well this is only the second Wednesday but still.   I'm happy. My self-esteem is up. Boyfriends will do that to you. Lol.   Also I have an ear problem wher I get vertigo and can't stand up every once in a while. It's a pressure thing. But yeah, it's happening again. It has to do with the humiditiy and pressure this time. I've always been able to feel pressure changes; like if someone opens a door realy quickly next to me, I can feel it in the pressure. Yeah. I'm a wierdo, I know. But it's something I'll always have to live with. It makes me feel like the whole world is spinning and I'll try to stand up strait and balance but I can't. Eventually I just close my eyes and fall over. But I hear it hilarious to watch. I'll just be swaying and reaching out for things to hold me up while the rest of the world just looks on in dismay. Then of course when I fall the pressure changes really rapidly cause of like altitude changes so it takes me a while to get back upright.  But yeah, that's happening again. Bad. But I'm trying to cope with it.
Okay. Now my boyfriend says that he didn't say ANYTHING. I believe him. But it's weird. You here's the story:  I was talking to Trev, my bf, last night and we were talking about bad things we'd done in our past, but not specifically. Jsut agreeing not to ask each other about them and accpet the fact of not knowing everything. You get it?  Anyway the next day, his best friend IMs me asking if I've ever shoot up heroine. (Which I don't and never have, btw.) It was really wierd. And I wondered for a minute if he shot up heroine or if Trev did or does. Really scarey thoughts. See Trev had told me the past night that wahtever I did in the past could never be as bad as what he did, times ten. So maybe he shot up heroine, I thought. Which still wouldn't be as bad as mine, in my opinion. But still that scared me. But it's in the past.  Okay... now he says he never did any drugs at all ever. Good thing. Me either. Life is good again. Aaaawww. He wants to come see me. How sweet. Ok then. Cool.
Oh... cool. I think it worked. Although it's not 4:47 pm. It's like 7 something. Weird. But seeing as this is a kind of journal, here goes:  I'm talking to my new boyfriend right now. He's great. Really really sweet. But we're going through things. Nothing much, just that whole boyfriend/girlfriend/best friends of each thing. It's weird. It's this whole thing with shooting up heroine and stuff. I don't get it.
Is this working? I hope so.  A lot of my friends have blogs so in an effort to keep up with the times I gotten one too. I know, I k
