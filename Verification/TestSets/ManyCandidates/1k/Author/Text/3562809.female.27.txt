All people are multi-layered--onions, if you will, or parfaits (which Donkey & I are both fans of).  Some people take awhile to warm up to new people, easing into new acquaintanceships slowly, like one might inch into an icy lake.  They aren't unsociable or rude, these folks, they just have a more reserved nature.  Likewise, there are people who will behave amiably enough right away, but prefer to keep things on a slightly superficial level.  They may be very deep on the inside, but they are more comfortable engaging in very light small talk.  Pleasant enough to converse with for a spell, but you don't get a real sense of substance.  Then there are those rare people who, from the first time you meet them, completely engage you.  They cannonball into friendship with unabashed enthusiasm, embracing you with both arms and taking you along for the ride.  From the moment you meet, there are no awkward silences or contrivances.  They insist on seeing right to the messy core of you,  celebrating each quirk along the way, and returning the favor.  They challenge, delight, and stimulate each cell in your brain, and leave your soul feeling overflowing, alive, and happy.  After spending ten minutes in their company, you are already looking forward to the next dozen times you will spend together.   Thank you, A & N!
Cue the evil laughter!  My retarded neighbors (the loud sex ones, not the loud foreign-language ones) have Blink-182 crap blasting forth this afternoon.  Or maybe it's one of those other number bands... I don't know, they all sound the same to me.  I do have a "modern rock" station on the #6 button in my car, but for the life of me I don't know why.  Tuning into it is usually like hearing tinfoil put through a cheese grater.  I can tune into an R&B station, or even most classic rock stations, and within 1 second I can tell what song it is.  But this modern rock stuff, it takes a good 12 to 15 seconds to even place a beat!  As a busy girl, I don't have time for this type of complexity in my life!  If I did, I'd call up my most devoted ex and spend an hour debating with a brick wall. But revenge is sweet.  On comes Music Choice!  For those cable-impaired, Music Choice is the 30-or-so channels of straight music, arranged in categorized channels.  I think the Party Favorites channel will do nicely, heh heh heh.  Ah, lovely, BlackBox!!!  Volume up, babies!  Ah... it don't get any better than this.  Cue more evil laughter & self-satisfied smirk.
I have discovered that the best way to edit one's belongings is while a bit tipsy.  That's right, a little tichy-tichy gets those organizational vibes flowing right along.  That same lovely carefree feeling that prompts one to tell perfect strangers, "I love you!" comes in handy when tossing out half the contents of one's closets.  Dresses, skirts, sweaters, happily bounce into Hefty-land, tra-la-la!  It's more difficult to remember the emotional ties to certain wardrobe pieces, so out they go!  Another side-effect of alcohol intake is the sharpened memories of ex-boyfriends.  The ghosts of men past swoop through, whispering, "ah, yes... the dress you wore on the first date with J ..."  Out, out, out it must go!   I know, once the imbibing has begun, it can be a challenge to leave the couch (and the Mad TV marathon) behind.  Efficient, useful activity is not the most appealing concept when in that happy-go-lucky state of mind.  But trust me, you will thank yourself in the morning!  Just remember, although you may load the bags destined for Goodwill into the car while you're on that nice wobbly roll, wait til you're sober to drop them off.
Really, I am.  But probably not in the way you're thinking.  Let's keep our minds in a PG-rated place, people!  So then, I mean this pretty darn literally, actually.  When it comes to sickness, injury, convalescence in general, I'm what you might call a trail blazer.  I've never broken an arm, had pnuemonia, or mono.  Although in high school I used to long for mono... nothing sounded more appealing to my teenage self than being forced to sleep all day.  Actually, that still does hold some appeal, but now I have to pay my own bills, so scratch that thought.   No, when I go down, it always seems to be some crazy little thing gone awry.  The only bone I ever broke was in my left ring finger, when I was 15.  I was upstairs in my bedroom, and suddenly became filled with righteous rage at my mother for reasons I could not remember if I tried.  In my indignance, I attempted to descend the staircase while simultaneously stomping and hurrying.  Not a great combo for the stairs.  My foot caught on one of those carpet-pieces that people bond to the tops of steps, and in an effort to catch myself, I flung a hand out to the bannister--not so much in a grab, but in more of a flailing 'smack'.    But wait, it gets better!  The x-rays revealed that the bone had pretty much 'poofed'.  They gave it a few months to heal, but it never got around to it.  So I had to go into surgery, where they took a slice of bone from my hip and fashioned a new finger bone.  Yes, that's right, I broke my stupid finger and ended up having surgery.   Then there's the bikini-line saga.  Yeah, most gals get an ingrown at some point.  No biggie, right?  You tweeze the sucker, clean it out with some rubbing alcohol, maybe rub in a little Neosporin, and you're good to go!  Ah yes, unless you're me.  I did all the above, but it kept getting more and more inflamed, and in a couple of days I had a fever and chills.  I take my happy self to the ER, where they give me antibiotics and send me home.  The next day, the thing is the size o
