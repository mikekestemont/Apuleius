Greetings from the Bay Area!    San Francisco is amazing, and if it weren't for the crazy distance from our family/friends in the Great Lakes area, I think we'd be moving here ASAP!  The Ritz Carlton is spoiling us rotton, right down to the turndown service we were welcomed with after our evening out.  I couldn't help but giggle like a schoolgirl and take pictures to show you all when we get back.  Here's a sampling... our 2-sink extravagant bathroom complete w/ separate toilet room (with phone) and the luxurious gym & pool area are my personal favorites.. (the ladies' locker room looks like a fancy parlor in a mansion!!)    We've yet to hop on the cable cars but we've walked the steep hills, browsed through Macy's & ate a fabulous dinner at The Cheesecake Factory.  We also caught a movie (we still can't stay away from the theater!) at the Sony Metreon, which is 4 stories high!  Tomorrow we plan to have breakfast at the 5 Star Terrace here at the Ritz, visit the SFMoMA (museum of modern art), and check out Chinatown (which is 1/2 a block from our hotel) before trading the Ritz for the Archbishop's Mansion til Thursday!  We're looking forward to biking around Golden Gate Park once we're there :)  Btw-- We know many of you suggested against it, but we decided to bring Mark's laptop amongst the other 5 bags of luggage we've been struggling with...  (And I'm contemplating a trip to "The Container Store" for a suitable box in which we can send extranious stuff back to A2)!  We made a rule, however, that both of us need to agree to "laptop time" for it to occur... and even then it's pretty much only use for 3 things.   1) For clearing the 10 million spam from my email account... Sadly I receive about 150 msgs a day and if I let them pile up I don't think UMHS would be too pleased with me! 2)  To make sure Mark's workplace isn't freaking out in his absence (and he's pretty good at saying "oh that's not important" and ignoring them unless it's imperitive to throw them a bone...) 3)  Last, but not least, so we can put occasional updates on here and let you all know we're happy & safe on our fabulous honeymoon!  We love you all very much, but aside from the 2 calls we made to our parents (to let them know our plane didn't crash), our voices will be unheard by y'all until June 10th when we land in Detroit!  More to come...  Love, Mrs. Andrea Marie Heimonen (!! :)
Well, Andrea and I flew out of the Detroit Airport this morning, and are staying at the Ritz Carlton in San Francisco tonight.  Andrea's currently taking a nap, so I thought I'd take a minute to add a new entry.  The wedding experience was amazing.  The entire weekend was perfect.  Andrea and I drove up to Manistee already on Wednesday afternoon.  We were able to take care of the majority of the decorations on Thursday, so we could enjoy the rest of the weekend.  On Friday, we had a rehersal dinner at 440 West, which was great.  Later on that evening, us guys headed over to Striketown for a few games of bowling.  On Saturday morning, we had a team best ball match at the Manistee National golfcourse.  The course was great.  I teamed up with TJ and Luukas, and we ended up shooting a +9.  My dad, Pentti, Michael, and Clinton shot a +4, while Vesa, Chris, Kai and Daryl shot a +2.  I hear Michael played some great golf, and Vesa hit a beautiful 290 yard drive with the rented driver he was using.  I really enjoyed the best ball format, since I was able to relax, and actually hit a few good shots.  My dad recently bought me a new driver, and I hit a couple really long shots with it.  I hope to get out a few more times this year, and will hopefully be able to revive my game.  The ceremony was perfect.  Andrea had spent a lot of time giving pastor Lashbrook input on the vows and content of the ceremony.  I will always remember the moment the doors opened, and Andrea began walking down the aisle.  She looked amazingly beautiful in her wedding dress.  The reception was at Stronach Hall.  Again, everything was perfect.  I really appreciate all the effort every put in helping make the evening as perfect as it was.  Andrea spent months preparing for the event, and I really appreciate all the little things she did to make everyone feel welcome.  Some of the memorable ideas included:  -A kids table with gift bags to keep them occupied -Out of town guest bags -reserved seating, using movie themes -A hockey shootout for bride/groom kissing, adding a bit of Canadian culture  We stayed the night at the Manistee Inn, and had a brunch/gift opening back at the hall.  I really enjoyed getting a chance to see everyboy during the weekend.  It isn't often you get to see all your close friends and relatives at one time, and that was very special.  We drove down to the Detroit airport and stayed the night at the Weston.  The hotel was very nice.  Andrea wants to purchase the Weston bed, and a duel-shower head attachment like they had at the hotel.  We flew out of Detroit this morning, and are now in San Francisco, as I mentioned above.  This afternoon, we plan on beginning our honeymoon adventure in California.  I'd really like to thank everybody for helping out and taking part in our wedding, and for making it such a special day.  -Mark
