today was a cool day.  i went out with my mom and her sisters for a late bday celebration.  we went to lucilles somkehouse bbq...the food wasnt that good, but it was cool.  then melissa, jennifer, and i went to jasmines bday celebration and met a bunch of her family.  they are really nice and cool.  everytime melissa and i go out we get asked if we are sisters.  its really crazy considering we just met almost a year ago.  its real cool having a cousin my age that i can kick it with thats not stuck up.  nette is cool to kick it with too, but shes at a different stage in her life and shes not really sure what she wants to do with it right now.     so i can feel the confindence that i gained this year diminishing at a fast rate.  i dont know why that happens cuz im the same person, look the same, have the same amount of pouches(lol).  but i guess maybe its cuz neither one of us has expressed our feelings for one another yet.  im scared of his response and im not even sure if it would be better for me to know or not to know.  i guess its cool how we are for right now, but i know eventually im going to have to remove myself from him again just for the simple fact that my feelings for him are and always have been greater for him than his for me...at least thats what i get from his actions.  that may not all be true though, maybe i just express my feelings in different way than he does.  i guess ill just see what happens, but that will probably be nothing considering im always the one that asks what the situation is between us.  but like i just said it might be best that i dont know.
MY FUCKING LEGS ARE FALLING OFF.  IT FEELS LIKE SOMEONE IS TEARING MY MUSCLES FROM MY BONES.
i want to go to sleep, but i cant...im stuck here at work doing nothing but listening to my husband kanye.
so i guess we are "cool" now.  we talked and whatever.  you still ask for shit all the damn time, but its not like i didnt know that.  i just really wish you would grow up...  and what was this plan about?  maybe there was no plan and maybe "he" was lying about you and your friend, but i still cant figure out a reason for "him" to lie to me.  i really want him to be, cuz thats just fucking disgusting.    but yeah..none of this talking to me about you lick this and that, but you're "scared" of me.  i gave you 4 too many chances and you couldnt get it together on the last one that you supposedly asked for.  im tired of the games and im not playing them with you anymore.  lol...game over.    so i still need money and my boss is still nuts.  shes a good person, but shes not all there.    im taking mr white out for his bday tomorrow and i cant deny that i still have feelings for him.  i just hope i can stay strong and not give in.    yeah i need to lose like 5 pounds.  ive lost 10 since last year, but i still have this horrible stomach, although its not as bad now thats its a little smaller.  im still sexy though.  its crazy that when im not talking to anyone i have a lot of confidence in myself, but as soon as im ina relationship and theres a possibility that he might not want me anymore, its all fucked up, thinking im ugly and all that shit.  thats just out of control...i really need to get it together.  its not about guys, its about me.  this explains it all right here  "Love, your happiness don't begin wit a man Strong woman, why should you depend on a man I understand you want a man that's resourceful If he pay your bills, he feel like he bought you Talkin to a friend, about what love is Her man didn't love her, cuz he didn't love his Hugged her from afar, said what I felt You never find a man, till you find yourself Time helps mistakes, you can learn from Cuz one man fucked up men you shouldn't turn from You want a certain type of guy, gotta reach a certain point too At that destination, a king will annoint you Goin through the storm, many bodies stay warm That relationship died, for you to be born, you worth more Than anything you could cop in a store For you to grow he had to go so what you stoppin him for Not even I could ignore bein alone it's hard Find heaven in yourself and God" - Common
its really sad when you your whole life revolves around parties, hoes, and your cell phone ringtones...especially when you are a father.  obviously, you arent mature enough to take care of yourself, let alone a child.  your selfishness is out of control.  all you care about is what you can get out of people and you think that you never have to return the favor.  all you do is lie to everyone, including your best friends.  you cant admit when you are wrong. i cant believe that anyone could ever want you as a boyfriend.  you really should take what you can get cuz those girls do way too much for you for you to treat them that way.  all i can say is that one day you will get what you deserve.  oh yeah, and just because the girl says its ok, doesnt mean you share.  thats fucking digusting, do you have any kind of respect for women or yourselves?  you have daughters...  being a women is sad these days cuz guys especially in l.a. think they are pimps and try to get as many women as they can.  i cant imagine how its going to b
