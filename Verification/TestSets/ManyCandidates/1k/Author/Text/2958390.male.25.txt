w[]w! I created my first blog sitE!!! WELcOmE ALL!   --->mEfStEr
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT mEf.... I GOT MY NICKNAME "mEf" WAY BACK IN DECEMBER 1995. ((mEfStEr WOULD THEN BE AN ALIAS BY 1996)) IT WAS GIVEN TO ME AS A GRAFFITI WRITER NAME. THIS WAS AROUND THE FIRST TIME I DROPPED ACID. I "DROPPED" OFF AND ON FROM LATE '95 TIL ABOUT MID '98. WHEN I HAD EXPERIENCED A "BAD TRIP" SHORTLY BEFORE I HAD QUIT ACID, I TRIED SHROOMS. SOON AFTER, MY ACID DAYS WERE OVER. I HAD FOUND MY TRUE HALLUCINOGEN OF CHOICE; PSILOCYBIN MUSHROOMS. UP TO THIS DATE, I HAVE ONLY TRIPPED ON SHROOMS ABOUT A DOZEN TIMES. THERE IS SOMETHING MAGICAL THAT HAPPENS TO ME WHEN I EAT SHROOMS, I AM SUDDENLY TRANSFORMED. THINGS IN GENERAL SEEM SO MUCH MORE INTERESTING, I GET ALOT OF MY INSPIRATION FROM THESE "TRIPS" AFTER THEY HAVE HAPPENED. I ALSO SMOKE ALOT OF CANNABIS, I HAVE BEEN SMOKING WEED SINCE AROUND LATE 1994.
It was a beautiful day today, no rain just sunshine! Unfortunately, I didn't have anything to do tonight. Well I could've went to a party but I decided not to go. I went to the movies on Friday, I saw  "Dawn of the Dead"  I thought it was pretty good, It is typical of me to like zombie movies but this one was a good one. After the movie I went to take a walk in the neighborhood, to see who was around; then I went by my friend's house. We were just chilli'n in his attic drinking beers with some of my other friend's, who also came by. I stayed there until 2AM or so. I talked to a few people earlier today, and there wasn't much going on. Everyone was out and about, it was like 65 degrees today, spring is almost here! Well I guess I will just play it by ear right now, and see if anything happens tonight. Because, people always have a habit of calling me last minute, to go out and do something. Well that's it for right now.  Laterz   ~~mEf....
~mEf~ wAs hErE....  I'll drop back later for an update. pEAcE~
Here is an excerpt from my friend's personal writings ~NAmiXmiO ZEnLAzoG~  (M.G.)    Sitting on a foreign couch, in a foreign room, in a foreign house; with a familiar friend, one of few of my brotheron, whose friendship and companionship is more fulfilling and addicting than cocaine or injected heroin. Through my blood make it bubble and boil. It's the love and respect I have for my brotheron making my soul and body shudder; making me see clear, removing from my mind is all this clutter. Purifying my thoughts, my flesh, my spirit, for I need to prepare my solid, but fragile weak me for the wicked world, that almost killed me in the past. When my mind was full of intellect but not yet stable, where my body was a slave to pleasure and sin. Where my spirit, so weak it was easily manipulated and embraced and into the arms of evil. So naive, believed everything that was fed to me/forced-fed to me. I ran with the crowd, wore it's fashion, talked the talk, walk the board walk. And at this point when I was a phony, fixated, pathetic poser; I should have been on the concrete, an outline made of chalk. But after many heavy hits, I woke up and realized I am not a machine . Though, for a time I operated like one.
" The Terra Revolution and Venus "     People must never be afraid of the paths chosen by God.... In their hearts, they see the  path so much more clearly and truthfully than even the eyes. But in time, the tempting beautiful body only as far as the eyes will in time, come to pass. Today I burn under my brains consciences of what propels me out of trouble at times into Time itself, outside into the space of it all.... My body cannot breathe  there... What is my mind doing there? Why is my soul surpassing curious, egos, security, etc., going as fast as the speed of thought. The fastest and longest far reaching thing we know. Long ago sleepless nights would drift in with their bags and books of wonderment's and self debates.... Not of myself but of stars, music, Saturn's rings astro-notions. Before  L.S.D.  there were visions of eternities....   So many blisters un-medicated, unraped by human eyes as today on all across this Earth and through this house and home. That need not be explained to you but to the Devil.. The truth shall be to all.... The will to accept the truth must be fed, never suspiciously bled. It's just that we must prepare for one.... The amazement in how the truth shall be presented.   Nature shows more than anything and it does get pretty amazing. What's sometimes more amazing is how, people miss the warnings of tidal waves, Volcanoes....Earthquakes, etc... I know inside they pretend to miss the message we really could not care for our children. How can you push it back on yourself in the long run?    As we feel.. Eventually, we shall be our own children....
St. Patrick's Day     Yeah I haven't updated in a few days or so. I have been so busy lately, right now I'm writing this; and drinking some dEw. I am going to be posting my friend's poetry on this page within the next day or two. He goes by the name of; ~NAmiXmiO ZEnLAzOg~ Anyway, he saw my page and he said it would be great if I could put his stuff here. So I agreed to do just that, when I get the time. I mean this page is supposed to be about mEf, but I feel that my friend's are a part of this inspiration.
