The last few days at work have been interesting, to say the least. I was embroiled in a VIP transportation scandal of immense proportions. The normal morningtime bellman called out of his shift because he had swollen feet. The normal bellman is kind of an asshat. I actually went to the trouble of learning his name, a courtesy that he has yet to extend to me. He simply refers to me as, "man". So, he called out and the the embroligo began.  The front officer manager was notified as soon as the "swollen-footed one" made his impending absence known. Being the "ready to serve" employee that I am, Manager Man asks me to do a favor for him. I'm pretty certain that the front office manager doesn't know who I am either. This didn't stop him from talking to me like we've known each other for years. I suppose that this was a way to build trust and create a strong relationship in this time of uncertaintity and chaos. Actually, he was trying to save his own rep and pawn the responsibility of an abondoned job onto me. So, with reluctance and a heavy heart, I accepted the mission that would prove to be one of the most trying situations of my short life.   The mission at hand was as follows. I was to transport the members of a certain boy band, who at one time were chart-toppingly popular, to a charity golf tournament. I began the mission by parking the hotel van at the front entrance of the hotel. Then, trying to be as professional as I am capable of being, opened the van doors awaiting their entry. After opening the van doors I stood at the side of the van with my hands clasped behind my back in direct mimicry of cinema and television chauffers. I think that I probably looked like an idiot. While awaiting the 90's pop music royalty to make their exit from the hotel I began to panic. I had forgotten whether I was supposed to wait at the side door to avoid "fans", or whether I was fine where I was at. I made a panicked trip to the front desk to get my temporarily forgotten instructions. Turns out I was cool and the most harm that I received was condescending looks from the front desk personnel.   Finally, the boy band's manager arrived and turned a glance at me that said, "Ahhh, working class, how quaint." I showed him who the boss was by saying, "Is there anything that I can carry for you, sir." A few moments after our unspoken class war happened one of the members of the royal family arrived downstairs and lit up a Marlboro. I have to admit, I was impressed. I like to see a certain amount of vice in people. This admiration was soon dissipated when he told me to put his golf bag in the van. One after another the royal family of late 90's boy band pop slowly made their way to the hotel van and put themselves into my care.   After making sure all members were present I began the short drive to the golf course. During this entire affair no one spoke to me. I was simply the "hired help" and a necessary intrusion into their world of celebrity. We arrived at the golf course after an approxmately 10 minute drive. There were no rabid fans or paparazzi awaiting the pop powerhouse at the golf course. This simple fact gave me an immense satisfaction that I thought could only be acheived by seeing George W. Bush explode. After I had opened the door had and gotten their bags I waited for the huge tip that I was surely going to receive. Then it happened. NO DAMN TIP! I thought that SURELY there was some mistake. These fellows are millionaires, surely they can throw a 20 spot my way. No, obviously they couldn't. I guess they had fallen on harder times than I had originally thought. The worst part of the ordeal was that I didn't even get a "thank you" from these guys. At least throw some decency my way. I know that I'm not super-cute and I don't have a velvet vocal box, but I DID work overtime to get them to the tournament on time.   In retrospect, I would not have chosen to accept this mission.
I have a confession to make. I am Jim Steinman’s biggest fan. Terrible, isn’t it? You’d think that I would have more respect for the music community  than that, wouldn’t you?   Well, I don’t.   For those of you that don’t know who Jim Steinman is, he is the mastermind behind the most excellent 1977 Meat Loaf album “Bat out of Hell”. Also, he wrote music for Bonnie Tyler and Meat Loaf’s other big album “Bat out of Hell II”.   I know that I shouldn’t like this music. It is trite, over the top, and way too 70’s. But, for some reason I just can’t stop listening. I try to tell myself that I have other, more refined, musical tastes; but all I wanna do is listen to the Stein-Man.   If there is someone that has an antidote for this terrible affliction, please, send some my way.  The Reasons I Love Steinman:  1.	Operatic Rock ‘n Roll awsomeness! It’s Wagnerian!  2.	“Bat Out of Hell” was started as a rock opera about Peter Pan.    3.	What’s wrong with Bonnie Tyler’s voice?   4.	On “Bat out of Hell II:Back into Hell” Jim Steinman does this voice part and mentions how his guitar sounds like a horny angel.  5.	Mrs. Loud  6.	He always wears gloves. Really weird gloves.  7.	The Stein-Man is going bald, but keeps his hair really long.  8.	He writes music for a guy that named himself Meat Loaf.  9.	He is the most dirty-minded music writer in the business (sans Rap/Hip-Hop artists).
Often times my fiancée, Amanda, talks to me about how depressed and underwhelmed she is with the life that she is leading. I usually just try to smile and honestly hope t
