If you're wondering about the title of this post, no its not one of my aun'ts nickname for me. Its my new  multi-purpose  word   Shmuck   Now, it isn;t a bad word, nor is it a good word, its kinda  multi-purpose  Oh come on. You guys have heard of it. You know, shmuck (sh-muck), shmuckology, the study of shmuck? If you're going like "Oh, this guy's nuts" then please click the nice little X button at the top right of your screen now. OOh, and before you press that button, Shmuck You!  Nice to see the numbers on my hit counter have increased, many shmucks to that. By the way, SPIDERMAN 2's comin up, how many people are watching in the cinema? I'm not, VCD all the way, my "taiko"'s selling practically beside my house! There's also another reason.. kinda not sure about the ratings  (flashback) .... ..... (processing) .... ..... (static) .... *hits own head (FLASH)  2003- 4 people nearly got arrested and thrown into jail today for attempted entry into an 18SG rated movie The fugitives were caught as they were just about to enter to watch the hot movie at the time, THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS Now what really happened:  Fugitive: What the? Who are you? Why're you talking to me??? (oops) (shmucks the fake fugitive, who turned out to be an innocent passer-by) REAL Fugitive: Well it was like this, we wanted to watch Matrix, so we bought some other stupid UMUM show that was showing about 10-20 minutes before Matrix                And so we went past the guy, and entered the cinema. And then one of us who looked 18+ ish bought the matrix tickets and we swapped the tickets in the men's restroom                And upon exiting the loo, stupid us got over-excited and entered the cinema showing matrix, a good 10 minutes before they even started TAKING THE TICKETS                And so a guy entered and asked us "Where's your ticket?" We showed him the matrix tickets, and he smiled and motioned for us to follow him out.                Then the 'general manager' came, we suspect he wasn't because 20 minutes ago he was carrying drills and stuff, we think he was the resident handyman.. anyway                He dissapeared for like 10 seconds, and came back and said "Well, i watched the tape on the security cameras, and i didnt see you entering for matrix, now WHO TORE YOUR TICKETS?"                Our minds were like "Shmuck".. And we made up some stupid story about some 'unknown guy' tearing our tickets.. and the 'GM' laughed and he kept pestering us to tell the truth                Bad right? When it seems like it couldnt get worse, the damn matrix movie-goers came and the guy was berating us in front of them!!!! AH THE HUMILAITY (no such word)                At one point, we were going to crack, but one of us kept going, sticking to the story and digging our graves to like 452 feet. Then the 'GM' mentioned that if you had no ID to prove yourself                he could and would send us to the police. That was it. I gave him the fake tabs, the thing they tear out from your tickets and put into the box.. and he SMILED!! Shmuck him i say!!                And so we went to watch the other movie that we hadnt even heard of.. 'Uptown Girls' i think. If that wasn't enough, the shmucking projector was senget(BM slang) and the heads were coming out of                the bottom of the screen and the bodies were at the upper part!! TALK ABOUT BAD LUCK!! I've HAD EM' ALL! Shmuck Reporter: And who are those 4 fugitives?  Well, I'll tell you. Chen, Mahesh, Wenhan and me. The end. This is a true story. It is not fictional. It really happened you shmucking moron. Make sure it doesn't happen to you too.
