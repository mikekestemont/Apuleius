couple of things I want to jot down: David acknowledged our love-hate relationship.  He called me his "arch-nemi-friend"  and the other day reinforced it.  He told me he fixed the turbo on his car with the help of his father in law.  I asked why he didnt call me, he said because he/we/i was mad at each other.  I felt relieved to know that that shit wasnt all in my head.  We get along pretty good sometimes.  The other day was really good.  We were working/slacking off together all day.  We caught up on a whole bunch of shit that has been going on and had some good laughs and fun.  I was so pissed when I realized I was going out of town this weekend.  I was really excited about Yael moving back.  I started to plan to be in Austin when she first drove in.  But then it hit me.  I am going to be out of town.  I will see her as soon as I can.  I am so glad that things are better/back to normal between us.  They were pretty bad... and it was really wearing on me.  She means a lot to me.  More than I want to admit.  And I have invested a lot into this relationship.  And I am not giving up that easily.  I really think that we have a happy future together.  I cant wait to see her again.  Mary?  The last thing I needed from her was my key.  Which I checked into myself and found that she didnt have it.  So that should be the end of that.  We have nothing connecting us.  Just a vegabond of a friendship

Lastnight was not good.  Have you ever been in doubt about the one thing you were so sure of?  It fucking sucks.  I don't know what or who to believe in now.  It seems like everything is fucked up.  Everything has been brought into question.  This is exactly why I moved my faith into machines a long time ago.  Humans are just to coplicated.  In a machine, if it stops running, there is a reason.  And with a little wrench time and new parts its running again.  But when people break or do something completly unexpected, only that same person knows the reason for thier actions.  What they say is wrong is exactly that.  It is what they want you to believe.  Maybe it is true, maybe its not... But there is usually alot more to it that what is said.  Stupid humans.  They themselves complicate the simplest most trivial matters.  Machines are free of emotions and feelings.  It is never going to stop working cause you looked at it funny.  Or you came in this morning and didnt say hello.  Stupid humans.  And its compounded by the fact that I let this person in.  I let them into my world.  And this is what they choose to do to me.  This is why there is no one in my world.  No mother, no father, no sister nor brother.  Friends?  I can count them with one hand.  And I keep a close eye on thier actions and words.  Trust, but verify.  That is what I now live by.  So what will result of all of this?  I'm as eager as Yael is to find that out.  You know, I have been thru this before with Yael.  Right before I went to visit her in February.  She did something very similar to this.  This time was worse, I can not believe how badly I wanted to get off of the phone yesterday after hearing all of that.  I just wanted to hang up the phone and run.  Run far away from all of it.  I was laying there in pieces when she called back.  Every ring of the phone stung my ears.  I curled up in bed and wished the ringing to stop.  It did, or maybe I fell asleep, or both.  I woke up very exausted.. I found my phone and saw a voice mail waiting.  Should I check it?  I did.  It was Yael.  So I immediatly call her.  She does some explaining, I do a lot of listening.  And now I do a lot of thinking.  It seems like she is afraid.  I did not know that I had such an effect on her.  But does the negative effects out w
