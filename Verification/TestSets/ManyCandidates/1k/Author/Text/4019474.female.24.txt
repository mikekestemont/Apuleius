Hopes and dreams.. hopes and dreams.&nbsp; Hehe.   My dear friend and partner in the destruction of the Circle - who I will call The Reluctant Kiri (anonymity is soo mysterious) - decided to fulfill her Hopes and Dreams of making a story she's had for a few years come to life.&nbsp; The budget?&nbsp;A full tank of gas equivalent to PhP 1200.&nbsp;&nbsp;  It took only two scoops of chico ice cream&nbsp;at Pepato for The Reluctant Kiri to finally confess her vision to me (we should be grateful to that odd brown fruit).&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a simple, lovely idea based on painful hopes and&nbsp;too many kilig movies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The duration between the conception of&nbsp;the idea and the time it took for her to tell me (years!) as well as the forced casualness of the atmosphere it was revealed in were all signs of a confession.&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn't have to say it; I knew it was personal.&nbsp;&nbsp;That meant&nbsp;it had to be done.  After three days of planning (with coffee and movie breaks in between), the day to shoot came.&nbsp;  As first-time filmmakers/producers/actors, we all tried to grapple with&nbsp;our awkwardness&nbsp;in front and behind the camera.&nbsp; None of us had any real credentials after all (except maybe for the lead actor, X).&nbsp; I could have taken the filmmaker's 'advice' and said, "You know, it's in my  blooood..."&nbsp; , but that's just plain inside-the-circle bullcrap.&nbsp; Hilarious, yes.&nbsp; Legit?&nbsp; Never.  The only person who came off as a natural was our bakeshop janitor, Three, who proved he was professional enough to take a swing of a dirty walis at his face.  I won't go into the details of what happened and how it went.&nbsp; I'll leave the filmmaker to&nbsp;do that in&nbsp;her blog (she might kill me as it is for revealing this much).&nbsp;&nbsp;I will only go so&nbsp;far as to say that as a first-timer, I was stunned.&nbsp; It's amazing how a person's vision can suddenly come to life right before your very eyes.&nbsp; Every frame was straight out of a person's portal.&nbsp;&nbsp;I watched giddily as the tension between the two characters brewed.&nbsp; As we trudged back to the car, I could feel my veins tingling.&nbsp; It was the realization of somebody's  idea  and I had witnessed it all.&nbsp;   Of course, The Reluctant Kiri tried her very best to seem nonchalant and unaffected (good job, by the way).&nbsp;   I'm sure she feels that the film, being so personal, will expose her later on and come back to haunt her.&nbsp; I don't think it's a problem.&nbsp; Lars von Trier feels the same way about his first film (a short called  The Orchid Gardener ).&nbsp; In the May-June 2002 issue of FILM, a magazine published by the Danish Film Institute, Trier says, "I haven't seen it ( The Orchid Gardener ) in a long time, and it's excruciating to watch it because I've exposed myself in it.&nbsp; As the years go by you become better at not exposing yourself quite as much, at exposing yourself only as much as is required."  So you see, Kiri?&nbsp; This is the beginning of a life-long commitment.&nbsp; You have to follow it up with another film to justify the first.&nbsp; Hehe.  It's not so simple - living out your dream; it's bound to jostle some unfamiliar feelings.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just because a vision is realized, it doesn't mean everything else will fall into place.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it's an incredibly inspiring&nbsp;start.&nbsp;   I like to think of it this way:&nbsp; A friend of mine shelled out money for a tank full of gas and now has everybody in the cast and crew emotionally covered at least for an entire year.&nbsp;&nbsp;If that isn't no-budget dreamweaving, I don't know what is.
Even the most insouciant people in the world have moments of depth, though usually there are no real witnesses.&nbsp; Once, after a long night out with friends and people who liked to share intimate laughter with me as though we were friends, I drove to the neighborhood park for a cigarette.&nbsp; As I settled in the familiar warmth of my solitude (which I am so accustomed to),&nbsp;I realized no one would ever know the true stirrings in my loins - not the people I was with, not the ones who know me best, not the ones who've known me all my life.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I saw a patch of mongo seedlings growing next to a gnarly tree and realized that at that particular moment, they were the only witnesses to my confessions.&nbsp; I&nbsp; was delighted.&nbsp; It tickled me that some hours before, a curious&nbsp;kid had scattered the green seeds across the field, hoping that the next day, he would see little leaves sprouting from where the&nbsp;mung beans&nbsp;once were.&nbsp; How was he to know that some sad person had found hope in his little science project?  So much sadness comes with having no one to really talk to.&nbsp; There are always people around; we belong to a culture that thrives on company.&nbsp; But company is often as good as no company, as I've witnessed in hollow conversations, empty laughs and glazed glances.&nbsp; Underneath it all is&nbsp;a sadness that drives people like me to empty fields and vacant lots, hoping to find refuge and solace in a cigarette, and finding instead a patch of growing seeds.&nbsp;  &nbsp;
...and they taste good. &nbsp;      &nbsp;   Hear me out,  walang makausap  -- this act of humility and self-&nbsp;indulgence is for you.&nbsp;     &nbsp;     ( I'd also rather do this to keep in touch with you guys than to ever set an electronic foot in friendster.)        &nbsp;
Everytime I step on the thick yellow line painted on the subway platform and the 1 or 9 train comes rushing towards me, I  feel like I'm going to get hit.  My stomach drops and my eyes shut slightly. The train speeds by like a furious silver bullet, aimed right at me, but always missing by an inch or so.  Then it slows down to a halt and I see my reflection on the dull metal walls. Sometimes I don't even recognize the person I see.  It's easy to get lost in your anonymity, in a sea of f
