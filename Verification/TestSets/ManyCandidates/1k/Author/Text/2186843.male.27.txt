You know, on a normal day, I wouldn't think too much about seeing a guy walking down the streets of Lowell wearing a full Superman outfit.  But since it's Halloween, I'm hoping he was in costume.  Or else Superman really let himself go.  He looked like he'd put on a few pounds, and hadn't showered or shaved for a few days.  What would Lois Lane say?  Maybe she left him for another superhero.
Gotta give a shout out to the listener who brought me the 6 pack of Sam Adams Octoberfest yesterday, even if he did drink one of them on the way to the studio.  I've said it before, and I'll say it again: No beer tastes quite as good as free beer.  My sidekick can have all the candy and baked goods he wants.  Just bring me the liquid refreshment.  So it's Halloween.  Hopefully there's no kids in my building who'll be knocking on my door today, 'cause I didn't buy any candy to give out.  They'd have to choose between a bottle of the Octoberfest, a leftover slice of pizza or a half-eaten jar of peanut butter.  Which one would  you  take?  And before you ask, no, I'm not dressing up for Halloween.  I stopped doing that when I was 13.  I may, however, go check out a few of the haunts around town tonight.  You know what the worst job to have on Halloween might be.  Teacher.  Remember when you were in grade school and it was Halloween.  Everyone wears their costume to school.  Everyone's all hopped up on candy that day.  Plus there's the promise of getting a ton of candy after school.  Who in the world could concentrate?  They seriously should just give schools the day off.  At least elementary and middle schools.  The high school kids are like that every day.  I can't imagine anything gets done today.  Hopefully teachers know this, and don't pick today as the day to teach the really important stuff kids need to know, like who was King of England in 1563, and how to figure out where Train A and Train B will meet if they leave Los Angeles and New York at the same time, heading at different speeds.  By the way, I'm not an expert on the rail system in America, but isn't it possible for those trains to take different routes, and thus they never cross paths?  Bring that one up to your math teacher and see where that gets you.  I have no idea how this relates to anything, so let's move on.  Quick note to the Sawks... normally teams wait until  after  they win the World Series before they dismantle the whole team.  In the space of a week, they've told their successful manager he's no longer welcome in this town.  And now yesterday, they take their cleanup hitter and offer him to any team that wants him FOR FREE.  This, on the same day they once again raised ticket prices.  Are you kidding me?  I know Manny's pretty selfish and his teammates probably hate him, but maybe you should have thought of that when you signed him for $20M a year.  They'd better be real careful, because people around here are going to be really pissed if that team finishes 4th in the division next year, just behind the Baltimore Orioles, managed by... wait for it... Grady Little.
As I'm getting ready to leave the house this morning, I'm watching this HBO documentary about rich kids.  Not just rich kids, but FILTHY rich kids.  Publishing familys, the Trumps, people like that, who have hundreds of millions, even billions of dollars in the family.  It centers around the kids who stand to inherit all this money.  They're all late teens or early 20's.  Not to sound jealous, but most of these kids are basically nerds who haven't had much of a social life, probably because they're so rich.  They're involved in the Fencing Club at school, and when they talk, they sound like ultra-rich people.  Anyway, the whole thing is basically these rich kids whining about how rich they are, and "maybe my life would have been better without all this."  Meanwhile they're going to clubs in the Hamptons that seat you according to how rich and famous you are, and charge each table a two bottle minimum at 250 bucks a bottle (900 for a magnum of Cristal) while P. Diddy is sitting at the next table.  I'm here to tell you, your life wouldn't be better without the money, jackass.  You want to find out?  Give me your 700 mill and you can live in my apartment and struggle to pay the rent and not be able to afford health insurance.  Then tell me what you think.  Money is always better than no money.  They say money can't buy happiness.  Well, no money can't afford to buy anything.  Not that I'm bitter or anything.
Well, I decided to post, just so I would go a whole day without putting something up.  Today was a pretty uneventful one, and I just don't have anything interesting to say.  So instead, here's a joke one of our listeners emailed me earlier:  Guido and Giuseppe were applying for their work visas in America. The agent asks Guido, "What kind of work are you trained to do?" "In da old country, Ima work in da garment factory.  Ima stitch-a together 500 pair of woman's panties a day!" "And what about you?, the agent asks Giuseppe. "I'm a deisel fitter." "You mean you're a mechanic?" "No ima worka with Guido.  After he stitch-a da panties, Ima pull 'em over my head.  If they no rip, I say "deisel fitter", and put 'em in da box.   Seemed appropriate with all the talk of underwear (or lack thereof) on the show the last couple days.  Thanks to Dolly for passing that one along.  Off to bed.
Well, not much to do tonight, so I veg-ed out in front of the tube.  And there was some cool stuff.  The season premiere of 24: T
