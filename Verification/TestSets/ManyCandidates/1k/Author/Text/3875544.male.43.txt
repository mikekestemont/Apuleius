It is morning and I find I have the highest energy for blogging in the mornings than at any other time. Let's comment on some things.... Greenspan: what's a damn 1/4 gonna do? I am poor and owe money...I love inflation!! It's wonderful for property values... It makes the dollar strong abroad. And let it happen where it hurts most. Not in my pocket but the pockets of the rich. Yachts, Diamonds, Cartier, Gucci, and Rollex watches... But where does it happen most???? Health care... Gasoline, groceries, prescription drugs, ONLY good place where it's going the right direction for all good people,... Electronics and computer type goods, yeppers!! You know I have figured out why health care can go up so much!! IT is because it is a form of extortion. I mean who's gonna say "OH that's to much for a triple by pass! I just won't pay that" or "Cancer Smancer, I'm not paying that for chemo!!" No it's either you die or you pay Madame.... Now what's it gonna be.?... 3 months or 3 years? You decide. Now some where out in blogland for the many who read my blog I have a question.>>> Enlighten me. Where is the price pressure coming from in medicine??? I know 2 things than you better not start off with in your answer unless you're willing to 'splain why it's not so. 1. Electronic and hightech goods are going down in price. So all the scans should be getting cheaper...Yah yah..?? That goes for the majority of tech related issues including the costs of genetic engineering....after PCR prices had to go down from there!!! Why not??? Now they are saying lower doses of chemo maybe just as effective so why more cost?? And with all the studies being done and having been done instead of replicate many of them entirely for certain highly similar drugs as well as procedures don't they just cross reference older studies and do it cheaper? And What the hell ever happened good common sense? Why aren't we exploiting the placebo effect instead of using it as a simple benchmark to get above when testing pharmaceuticals. Tell everyone some cheap and (of course innocuous) substance it the breakthrough de la breakthroughs of some horrible cancer and let it do it's charm. Now why is that so bad? If our brains tell us that something is going to work it has been proven that it is far more likely to do so then let's try exploitation of the placebo effect based on the fact that if anything exceeds the placebo effect in efficacy then it passes the FDA Tell someone it is a wonder drug to one group tell the other nothing that your just trying out an experimental (but safe) new drug to see if it works and check the difference if the group told "IT'S A WONDER DRUG" does better than the other group the FDA should approve it. I mean who has a copyright on psychological manipulation?? And if it saves lives.... Why not? I think ethicists are a little unethical.&nbsp; O
