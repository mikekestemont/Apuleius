Well I decided to start this thing again... Im not sure if everyone's ready to read all about what's going in my mind though... oh well.  Oh if anyone would love to change my template to make it pretty, go right ahead, i need help.  thanks I will totally update tomorrow I suppose
So... I haven't updated in a while. Sry about that! Anyway, this week was really stressful I must say.  Seems everything was due because senior trip is tomorrow and they wanted to fit everything in before then! Wednesday was pretty boring.  School, training (hung with Miss C cause softball actually had a day off!!), came home.  The usual... Yesterday was a long day though.  School, training for softball's practice then right to the basketball banquet.  BLAH! can you say long day? it's ok.  I love training and wouldn't want to be anywhere else anyway.  The banquet was alright too.  I guess I just feel a little out of place since I don't play.  We get invited as all but... I dunno I don't really want to go into much more detail about it in here.... anyway. Today was alright.  School, then training all day/night.  Softball had another night game! wahoo 10-0 against Burlington Twp! this is really exciting because this is the team we beat in 19 innings 2  years ago and lost to in states last year.  It started to rain which wasn't fun, but it's ok. Again good times with Miss C.  We leave for senior trip tomorrow am at 4! yay! 4 days in Florida! It couldn't have come at a better time either! I feel like I should be opening up more in here, using it as a way to vent my inner feelings because that's why I started this, however, quite frankly, I don't know that I can trust everyone who reads this. I have a hard time trusting a lot of people.  I used to trust some people and lost it... oh well... we'll see. Im off to bed so I can wake up tomorrow morning! I'll update next time on both florida trips!!
Yet another long day.  I forgot to post yesterday. Actually, I didn't forget I just didn't have time, I wanted to sleep.  Nothing too exciting happened yesterday so it's ok.  Just went to school and then practice.  Well actually, I trained for the lax game and some of baseball- just bounced back and forth, because... well... that's a long story I won't get into.  Whatever, it was fun.  I always have fun there, for the most part.  Sometimes I get frustrated or pissed, but for the most part I always enjoy myself.  I usually find something to laugh about... chances are I'll just do something stupid and that'll start it off.  Then last night I went home and did homework.  Then I went to bed.  That's usually my life.... shcool training homework sleep.  Today was a good day too though.  Went to school... blah! I really don't like school that much anymore.  Aside from the occational few good moments, I don't really like it.  Strange since I live there- but I really like it after classes (does that make any sense).  Anyway, then did the whole training thing.  There was a track meet today and since softball had a night game I hung out with Miss C. for a while there.  Today was one of those days where I was frustrated and pissed but something happened, I can't even remember what, and it made it all better.  Weird how that can happen.  After that it was a pretty good night.  Went and got Wendy's for dinner. YUM. Ate it at the field watching our softball game.  Good times in the training room afterwards when we were cleaning up.  :-) hahahaha Now.... I'm home... avoiding studying for my english test.  THat's about it... Maybe i'll study a lil and go to bed early! GASP! haha ok... Im done babbling now.  maybe I'll update tomorrow.
Well... today was gorgeous!! I woke up early cause I had to help out around the house with my Grandma since no one else was home and she broke her ankle.  I hung out, outside most of the day by the pool, even though it's not open yet.  I got even more burnt but that's ok. It'll be tan soon.  I also did a ton of laundry, but whatever it needed to be done.  Then I showered up, attempted some physics and went to family dinner at Matt's Nan's.  Good times, I love his little cousins, they're so cute.  Now here I am again, trying to do physics. It sucks and no one understands it! blah! I'm going to bed... maybe I'll update more tomorrow! later
Ok. So here goes another attempt at starting this thing up again.  We'll see how it goes.  Anywho... today was a long day I must say.  Woke up early to go to the softball tournament all the way in Jersey City- we won wahoo! I was there alll day!! then came home, showered and went to the bowling alley to see Matt for a while.  Nothing to exciting but Im kinda tired.  I just got back from Florida on Thursday night with the softball team! What an awesome time!! SOooo many funny moments!! haha Gotta love the NBC softball girls! Then, what's even crazier, is this time next week I'll be in Florida again with senior trip! Im so excited!! I got some color so Im no longer clear! I can't wait to get even darker.  There's been a lot going on in my head lately though.  I suppose I will share it in here since most people won't read it anyway.  Let's see, where to start.    Things have been getting crazier and crazier.  Im almost out of highschool and its so exciting yet so scarey.  In about four months, I'll be in college! California University of Pennsylvania here I come! yet- Im not sure I'm totally ready.  I am going to miss so many things about Northern and the relationships there.  I
