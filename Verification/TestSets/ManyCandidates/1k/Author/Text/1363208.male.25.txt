Ayarrk!! I'm sleepy! Need rest. I haven't had any sleep last night. Thanks to my housemate who was on the phone till near 4.00am in the morning. I didn't sleep because if I go to sleep then he won't be able to enter the house. Locked. And also, this is all because of a concern for a friend.   W/ Us. Fadzil: He couldn't find out where he put the specs for the website. Dateline is on April 11th, 2002.
This morning breakfast:  jemput-jemput bawang  Menu for lunch:  sardin + telur dadar  Syoookk!!! Masak sendiri mestilah syok.. pulak tu sardin memang kegemaran aku...
Ah well.... my students are still a long way from understanding Linux. They don't even know how to properly issue a Linux command yet. One thing for sure, in every session, they're all chitchatting and laughing the whole time. Duh....

Mixed Version  I was thinking of making this blog a bilingual blog. Ouch! Out of my mind please! I'll rant in any language I want okay. I can rant in English, Manglish, Malay, or local dialects. Teeheehee...   Anyway.. just now Us. Fadzil called me: asking me to help build a website for his school. Insya Allah. I'll help but I'm not really sure about the design yet. Got to check a few samples agaknya.

No war please. I'm tired of seeing dead people in the newspaper, television, internet, etc. To US soldiers in Iraq, look out what you're killing. You're not just killing the innocents. You're also killing us.
Ah well. Hello everyone who's reading my blog. I'm using Internet Explorer after a try with Opera 7.01 failed. I'm playing Outwar. Help me by visiting  urlLink my Outwar page  anytime.
Today's menu:  self-made nasi lemak   Welcome back!   Two days offline. Yesterday... actually the plan was to go to Batu Feringghi but it changed to  ABIMPP - Regenerasi .  Baset was around, visited our new house, and had dinner with us yesterday. Long time no see. Long time no hear. There were lots of things we talked about. Forget the old days. Welcome dawn.  Today's story: Lina and Unie, both are in Penang today but I wasn't able to see them. Lina called around 1.40pm. Too,  late. Otherwise, I might be able to make twists to my timetable today. It's okay gals. Next time okay.  A collegue of mine, Chan Shing Yu has been admitted to hopital. No, he's not infected by SARS. I went to the hospital to visit him just now. Wow! What a beauty! Tak sangka ada nurse cun giler kat Penang Adventist Hospital, the place I went just now. It's now 8.08pm and there're still a lot students who hasn't arrived yet. The situation is getting worse.
Hi again everyone. Such a long while since I last put a post here. I'm quite busy lately.. with lots of things to do. Coming soon...  more and more busy days. I'm gonna start my FlashMX-based e-learning project next week, together with another two or three partners and companions. It would be an intense three-month project I'm not really sure about my rest after this.  I'm planning to get a laptop/notebook soon. Maybe by next week. Any suggestion?
I'm administering  urlLink my own server , which will be available if I am available. It is a local server. Whatever you see there is actually whatever I update inside my PC.
Wow! This new version of Blogger is really cool!
The last time I posted something here was in April... That's ages ago. There're lots of things happened since then. This weekend, I'm going to Kelantan, to visit my aunts, grandpa, and also a new friend of mine there, whom I met in IRC. Dunno what'll happen later but insya Allah I'll go see her.

Sampaikan salam buat semua salam terakhir salam teristimewa kepada kau yang ku sayang pada teman yang ku kenang pemergianku ini tak dirancang  usah bertanya mengapa aku mengucap salam terakhir kepadamu kerna waktu berputaran bimbang tak berkesempatan melahirkan kerinduan terhadapmu  demi sebuah kenyataan yang amat menyakitkan aku yang tidak berdaya hanya berserah padanya  salam akhir salam yang teristimewa kepada-Nya ku memohon keampunan melalui-Nya kuberi kemaafan kepadamu  Salamku yang terakhir    A song which kept singing itself inside my head for a few days.
Wow! I was really surprised and excited at the same time to know that the one time very popular Saga Artakusiad (a fantasy/fiction series by Ahmad Patria Abdullah) will be printed out again. No. Not the old Book 1 to Book 6. The book that will be published (currently from what I read, is still on the way) is Book 7. Never been published before. But the sad thing is, there's no reprint for the previous 6 books.  urlLink Search for Saga Artakusiad using Google.  You'll be very pleased. Ah... I'm a big fan of the series. Yay!
New version of  urlLink WINE (WINE Is Not Emulator)  is already out! Grab it now! Hot! But be forewarned, you should order pizza before compiling it. I compiled it with my Duron 1200+ machine at it takes about an hour to finish.  The time's enough for you to wait for the pizza guy outside and have a chat with the girl next door. LOL! ^_^
