It is 6:50 in the AM on a Saturday morning and I am at work.  There are so many things wrong with that sentence...  But I gotta work.  What else is going to pay for my crack habit?  :)  Anyway, I had to wake up at 4:30 this morning to get into work on time.  Plus, I had to buy donuts for all my employees that also had to be here at the butt-crack of dawn.  'Cause that's what a good boss does.  He buys his employees breakfast that makes them FAT!   Back to my point...  I got up at 4:30 this morning.  That wouldn't have been so bad if I didn't go to bed at 3:30 this morning.  If I do the math correctly, that means I only got 1 hour of sleep.  Suprisingly enough, I'm not tired... yet.  Angela looks tired.  She is sitting at the desk next to me sleeping.  It's nice that she gets paid to work so hard!  JK...   That's all for today.  I'm going to Angela's house later 'cause Kathy is in town.  Should be fun!
I hate the fact that my over-achieving friends make me feel like such a loser.  I have come to discover tonite that A BUNCH of my other friends also have their own blogs.  And you know what?  They're blogs are like 1,000 times better than mine.  They got pictures and different colors and SHIT!  It makes me feel like less of a man...  Well not really.  But it makes me wanna kick some ass! I'm going to figure out how to make my blog the shiz-nit!  I too will have pictures, and fuckin' bouncing monkeys, breakdancin' gorillas and NAKED, NAKED chicks just scattered all over the place.  It will be so ridiculously over the top.  SERIOUSLY!  (I only said that because Ang thinks I say "seriously" too much)  SERIOUSLY!  SERIOUSLY! SERIOUSLY! Alright, I gotta go.  I'm going to the gym and work out.  It case you wanna know, I like to work out in T-I-G-H-T spandex.  :)  Just kidding. I will see everyone later.  And to all my friends, this is Blog War.  I will take out my Blog Bazookas and Blog missiles and Blog Machine Guns and blast some holes in your mutha fuckin' asses!
I got a kink in my neck that just won't go away.  I swear I wake up every morning with a sore neck.  It feels like I've been karate kicked in the neck over and over and over again.  "Yeah, put him in a body bag!!!"  (That one was for Ang)  I have no remedies for the infidel that is my sore neck.  I'm just poppin' pills hoping this pain will go away.  People say that it's probably because of my bed or the way that I sleep.  But you know what, I've slept the same way for years...  I fall asleep crying in the fetal position.  That's normal right?    PEACE OUT MOTHER FUCKERS!   I love you!  P.S.  China, thanks for the voicemail this morning.  I know if I hit it once I can hit it twice!
So the posting continues...  I'm actually posting today later than I usually do, but that's only because I have been soooooooo busy all day today.  (Do you like how 7 extra o's to the word perfectly conveys that?)  It's ridiculous how much work I have on my desk today!  I don't know about everyone else, but I don't think working is part of my job description!  I guess I'll quit whining... Sorry but there's nothing interesting going on with me today.  I'll cross my fingers and maybe something cool will happen to me today.    T.T.F.N.!
This past weekend was/is a complete haze.  Let me start by saying to everyone out there in the world...  If I called you at any point between 11:00pm and 3:00am on Saturday, then I apologize for anything "inappropriate" that I may have said.  If anything, I guess I'm also sorry if I happened to wake you up.  But in my defense, WHAT WAS YOUR ASS DOING ASLEEP ON A SATURDAY NIGHT ANYWAY!?! Anyway, I'm pretty sure I had a good time on Saturday.  Me and my friend China, China, China, China, China (what do you think of that Queen Kate) went to a club.  We went ghetto style.    ghetto style:  ghetto style in this case is buying a bottle of vodka and making your own drinks before you even get to the spot.  it involves getting drunk before you even get there.  let's face it, my cheap ass is not paying $8 for a watered-down drink!  I spent all day Sunday being hungover.  I always recommend that!  (in a sarcastic tone)  We went to Sea World to check out the new water ride they got there.  So, we waited in line for about an hour before we finally get the news that the ride is "temporarily out of service."  FUCK THAT!  So, China, her sister Monica and I left and went to the Budweiser beer school.  We all graduated and got our Beer School Diplomas.  See Mom, I told you I would finish school!  Needless to say, I don't think drinking 6 glasses of beer superfast was the surefire cure for a hangover...  I guess I'll take off now, I feel myself rambling on...  Where the hell is that beer?
I am in quite a funk today and I can't seem to figure out why.  I just spent 10 minutes staring at my spaghetti trying to figure out what color it is...  It's not red and it's not orange.  I will call it "Sporangetti Red."  Maybe cause I woke up about an hour ago and went right into work...  Dunno. This funk is funking me out.  What the funk!?!  Or as my friend Angela would say, "I am in a mood today."  She is probably right.  I guess I can be pretty moody.  I need some sort of constant in my life I guess. Maybe this is partly because my friend is going to be gone all weekend and I don't know what I am g
