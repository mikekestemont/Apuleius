Rex Morgan MD = SWASS!  All the time I've spent talking up Marmaduke, I completely forgot to mention Rex Morgan.  I know this is a comic that you all skip past because you starting reading the comics page as a kid, and Rex wasn't funny.  You need to get past that.  Rex is all about the drawings.  Screw the story.  There's always at least one frame that is a genuine work of art.  It would make  urlLink Roy Lichtenstein  jealous.  My favorite in this one has to be the last panel.  It's got action lines.   urlLink    this is what you've been missing!&nbsp; urlLink
Here's one for everyone in the Twin Cities  I don't want you guys to feel left out.  The Twin Cities is a seriously swass place.  Plus, you guys can claim Prince as your own.  Now some of you may not think Prince is too swass.  But seriously, look at this picture and tell me  urlLink the man  isn't  urlLink solid .   urlLink    Here's a picture of Prince playing the guitar so fast it's smoking.&nbsp; urlLink
HELP!  The computer I'm using whack.  So lately everytime I go on the web, a gazillion pop-ups come up.  They never stop.  It's gotten to the point that I spend more time closing those windows than using the page I want to.  And no, I'm not on the porn pages.  Also, lately it won't let me download any pictures.  That one really stinks, since I just learned how to post pictures.  Can someone tell me what the eff is going on?
Who's That Blogger?  So apparently there's this blogger that goes by the name of  urlLink Rance .  This "Rance" is supposedly an A-list actor, but no one can figure out which one. Go to the site, see if you can be the first to unveil him. Or stay at this site, and bask in the swassness of the Gutte. Okay, so my computer sucks right now and I can't get the picture to work, but trust me, he's looking mighty swass.  Hopefully it'll be up tomorrow.   urlLink    Could this be the Gutte's Rance disguise?&nbsp; urlLink
Swass Fact #1  If you type "Freakin" into your post on blogger and do a spell check, it will recommend the word "foreskin".
Another Accomplishment for the Swass Report!  I'm taking this thing to a whole new level.  For all of my illiterate friends, I give you pictures!  For all of my computer illiterate friends, I think you smell bad.  It's not like they'll ever know.  Freakin' caveman hippies.   urlLink    bang the drums and drink champagne!
I'm going to make all of my friends look bad.  I've decided that in my spare time I will be working on an art series.  I will call it "Bad Paintings of Good Friends" or maybe "Bad Representations of Good Friends"  because while they may look like a deformed version of them, the painting itself may actually be pretty cool.  Then I will get them in a gallery and sell them.  Once sold, the owner will put it up on their wall where visitors will see it and say,"Damn he/she's ugly!  Who is it?"  And the owner will say,"A friend of the artists.  He only knows ugly people."  Maybe this isn't the best idea after all.  But there's only one way to find out, by doing it anyway.
Friendly Reminder  Today's Marmaduke is solid.  Don't forget to check it out.
Are Homeless People Spies?  I'm pretty sure that at least 2% of all homeless people are high-to-mid level spies.  You know how you see one that seems out of place every once in a while?  It's like, why would a homeless person hang out here?  Because he's got no home? No! Because he is spying.  I saw one today in Santa Monica that had to have been a spy.  I was polite though, I didn't blow his cover.  I also didn't give him any spare change because we all know spies make good money.  Maybe I'm wrong, but if I am, the CIA should hire me because this is a great idea.  Everyone tries to avoid eye-contact with bums, so what better way is there to survey a place without anyone noticing? (the answer is none.)
I have to take a trip to the zoo!  I recently read that koala bears get drunk off the juices of the eucalyptus leaves.  When they get drunk they fall off the tree.  I have to see this.  I want to know: when they shake off the fall and get back up, do they stumble around and make lewd gestures?  I hope they do.
Who is Mitchie Brusco?  That is the question I have asked the greater Los Angeles area for the last two days.  And quite frankly, I'm a bit disappointed in the population.  For a town where everyone wants to be an actor, how is it that they're all camera shy or completely uncreative.  Especially since I tell them to just make it up if they don't know who he is.  I'm giving them complete creative control.  Something one doesn't often get in this city.  There were a couple of good ones though.  My favorites had to be : a Jewish Carpenter that died for our sins (way off, but funny), and the artist that draws Marmaduke (ok, I told her to say that one but I still like it).  I'm working on a very slow connection, so you'll just have to look up everything that should have a link the hard way.
urlLink DDR  vs.  urlLink McDonald's   Dance, Dance Revolution is doing all it can to get kids off their lazy asses and exercise.  So much so in fact, that some schools are making it a part of their gym classes.  That's way better than getting pelted in the head with a rubberball, by some 5th grade behemoth that already has to shave everyday.  However, in fear of losing customers to healthy habits, McDonald's is starting to offer DVD rentals at select stores.  Not only encouraging you to sit around all evening in front of the TV eating junk food, but you a
