Once again I've got up today and had another huge kick up the arse reminder of how things were last year and the contrast is the thing that is most upsetting I suppose.  I got woken up early by BOO who for some reason couldn't settle and kept tipping his water over on purpose.  By the time I had got up for the 3rd time to restabilise the lamp on the table and to mop up the water I was wide awake and there seemed little point in getting back into bed just to sit there waiting for him to do it all again.  So I got up and thought I wouldn't log onto the internet right away as Saul was still asleep and it would make a noise so I sat at the computer and played ZOO TYCOON for an hour or so.  I know that sounds childish but its a distraction technique that I use when there might be something simmering in my mind which I need to try not to unveil.  Eventually Saul started to stir and I thought I'd come online to check my e-mail.  Things are very quiet in all of my groups.  There were a few forwards and not much else so I checked my other account.  You see I have a hotmail address for my group mails and a hotmail address for my personal e-mails.  When I checked in my personal account there was a name from the past sat in there staring at me.  My old tutor from uni (where I was last year) was writing to ask whether I would be rejoining the course or not.  If not he would have to withdraw me.  (For anyone reading this who is not familiar with the situation - The reason I can't do the course anymore is because the uni is way way away from where I live, and the only way I could manage to do the part time course there was to stay with my parents for 3 days of the week.  However last January we had a big arguement and they said they didn't want to see me again.)  Since back then of course not only have things not been great with mum or dad (not great being an understatement) but my money situation has changed.  I know no-one believes me anymore.  They think I'm fine and that whatever was wrong with me is gone.  However I'm sat here feeling awful again today and I'm wondering whether it isn't time to maybe attempt a trip to the doctors.  My back has been permenantly bad since before last Christmas and now my stomach muscles hurt too (could be to do with the bug I've just got rid of mind you).  On top of that ME doesn't just go away.  I deal with it better now but none of you seem to understand.  Yes I do go out and yes from the outside maybe I do look better.  But I sleep until 11 most mornings and get up feeling shit.  I take paracetamol out with me wherever we go just incase I get bad pains, and I am not by any means as well as everyone thinks.  That said, I am still relying on my incapacity benefit and since moving in with Saul officially (eg changing all of the details over to London) I am now expected to be paid for by him and so I only get £30 a week.  This is yet another reason why I can't  do the course anymore.  It used to cost me £25 a week just for the trainfare to get there.  Anyway all those details aside, I'm sat here feeling quite pissed off right now.  I loved that course and I know there is no way I can do it now, which to me is yet another slap in the face.  You see Ben, when I was at school I struggled so hard to fit in.  When everyone else said they were going to 6th form and that only losers went to college, I wanted to fit in so I worked my arse off to get into 6th form.  I hated every minute of it.  I hated being treated like a child and expected to not leave the grounds just as you are not supposed to when you are 12.  Thing is I wasn't 12 I was 16 and it annoyed me.   Every minute of 6th form was agony, and I think it was then that I started to get ill because I used to feel sick in Sociology lessons where we had to sit in the lecture theatre.  Because I felt sick in there, I'd not eat because I thought if I didn't eat I wouldn't feel sick.  Of course that doesn't work.  On top of that then I used to feel sick and feel dizzy and my concentration used to wander.  Gradually it spread to more lessons and I felt ill most of the time.  I dropped a few lessons to see if the lightened work load would help but it didn't.  I should never have gone to 6th form just to be like everyone else.  I should have looked more at what I wanted to do.  Anyway Ben, by the time I was a few terms into 6th form I was feeling awful and so it wasn't long before I said to mum and dad I might drop out and go to college instead.  They thought that was a good idea because I could do what I wanted (subject wise) in college and at 6th form you couldn't do English and Geography because it was in the same subject pool and you could only do one subject from each pool.  So I started college and it was wonderful.  I'm not saying its the same for everyone - I'm sure most loved 6th form.  But I felt like a bird released and I loved college.  I'd go in with Dad every morning and I was there early before even the tutors turned up.  I
