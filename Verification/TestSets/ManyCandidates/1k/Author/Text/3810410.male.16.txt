So just go ahead and put the knife to my heart Either stab me now or rip it out again Do what you want The choice is yours... Cause I've given up on all senseless reason I've given up on acts of indiscretion Go ahead and kill me once more Just another way you show your perfection... I had a burden of giving you what you wanted I had a load of receiving your complaints But the measure of this world can’t compare to this Cause it can’t outweigh all my pain Go ahead, keep it all in, never give out before you go Go away, keep all those thoughts, never gave me the time of day What is really going on right now? You tell me that nothing is wrong, but I can tell that all is You try to change the subject, but one thing is only on my mind What is wrong? Was it something I said? Go ahead, keep secrets from me, I’ve never kept any of mine from you Go away, keep your wounds, I thought we would say it all upfront  What is really going on today? You claim you are busy, and can’t be disturbed It’s like you have another life, and I am unaware and unwelcome to it Well guess that’s the life we’ve made Guess that’s the games we play But it’s like I always lose and I can never win So I think today I will quit before I can begin Goodbye, goodbye Always hated leaving first, but now I fear the worst  So long, so long Always hate to admit it, but I can not forget it  I’m leaving now, better stop me before I go The doors getting closer and I just hate to leave Hello.
Your eyes-  How often I find myself lost in them, kind of like a fairy tale They take me away to a place that seems so very real Your goodbyes- How much the words hurt me, even when you’re gone only for a while Can’t you stay longer, make my dreams come true, just walk the extra mile Cause you know that I would do it all for you  I don’t need to tell you how much I care I hope by now you already know,  You know, that if you a had a burden I’d carry it for you And if you needed to meet me, I’d be there before you Just don’t keep me waiting much longer  Your mouth- Sweeter than the roses that resemble the color of your lips So perfect, so flawless, I would give it all away just for one more kiss Your soul- Gleaming of vibes that I could never comprehend, but I try to  Lights my way and gets me to the pathway’s end, and I need you Cause you know that I would do it all again for you  I don’t need to tell you how much I care I hope by now you already know,  You know, that if you a had a burden I’d carry it for you And if you needed to meet me, I’d be there before you Just don’t keep me waiting much longer (x2)  You, unlike me, see the world through better perspectives This viewpoint I have, can’t see much at all But you’re in my range, seems so strange to be here now  I don’t need to tell you how much I care I hope by now you already know,  You know, that if you a had a burden I’d carry it for you And if you needed to meet me, I’d be there before you Just don’t keep me waiting much longer
So go ahead and forget me I am not to be remembered But at least we had some good times Remember them before you say goodbye I can change with the flow I can, so I need to know just what to say What do I need to do? I know you’ve heard it before But the only thing I got going for me is you  I can pretend that I don’t notice you pretending I can act like I believe every word you say I’ve been holding my breath so I won’t take in your air It’s intoxicating, I just need to get away Just let me get away  So go ahead and overlook me I am not to be recognized But at least you gave me the second glance Recall us now, cause you never believed in second chances I can stay this way forever I can, but would this make it better if I did? What do I need to prove? I know you’ve read this note before But the only person I’d give my heart to is you  I can pretend that I don’t notice you pretending I can act like I believe every word you say I’ve been holding my breath so I won’t take in your air It’s intoxicating, I just need to get away Just let me get away (x3)  Let me give you a dozen roses Let me give you a dozen years I’d give you all the time you needed But that could never justify these tears  I can pretend that I don’t notice you pretending I can act like I believe every word you say I’ve been holding my breath so I won’t take in your air It’s intoxicating, I just need to get away Just let me get away (x3)
