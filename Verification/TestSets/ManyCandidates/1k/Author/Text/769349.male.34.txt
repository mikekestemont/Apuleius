I'm walking through Union Square Park this morning. Headphones on. Donovan's "Where is She?" comes on. It becomes this amazing soundtrack for walking lethargically through the park. Everthing's in slow motion. And I'm looking at the people on the benches. It's all surreal. These faces. These blank, tragic faces. Stone faces. Faces of madness, especially this cigarette smoke-wrinkled woman, heavy eyeliner, defeated and staring at dogs and smoking. The guy with palms pressed together chanting... And me still walking slow, because it's the way I feel. And Donovan walks with me...
"It's not that I hate people, I just like it better when they're not around." - Bukowski  My favorite line from the film "Barfly."   And on nights like tonight that line resonates like cattlecars crossing sidecreeks...whatever that means. Let me see if I can explain it further...  So tonight I hit the Holiday... Lots of kids in the joint. Loud, obnoxious fuckers who play classic rock on the jukebox. Granted, I can appreciate the Stones. And I'd like to thank the individual who played "Let it Loose," which I think is almost as great as that Bukowski line. But a man can only take so much greatest hits of the Doors, CCR, Tom Petty and the like... And I'd also like to thank the individual who played Nick Cave's "Into My Arms." But unfortunately all these loud fuckers were ruining the song for me.  All right, yeah, I know I sound I'm bitching and whatnot, but there are times where I don't mind people being loud and having a good time and all that shit. But I just wasn't digging it tonight.   Anyway, then these fuckers come in and sit a seat down from me. And they're talking all sorts of bullshit... And that's when the next and shoulders started tightening up. The jaw starts tighening up. Suddenly all these voices start to get louder. And I'm trying to figure out which one of these guys should have his face smashed into the bar first. But I take a few deep breaths, finish my round and vacate.   Then on the L train more madness. I've got the headphones cranked and I can still hear this chick talking to this guy right next to me. And I'm thinking, Jesus, she's six inches from the guy. Does she have to talk so loud? Hell, I just want to listen to Tom Waits in peace. And the train's packed. And the time it takes to get from 1st Ave. to Bedford seems like hours. But at Bedford a lot of people clear out. Another deep breath.   So now I'm back at the crib. Listening to Erik Satie. Neck and shoulders still tight as fuck. I'm trying to decompress. And writing this is helping cut through all the madness. I just needed to get this shit out before I go to sleep...
I've been itching to hear some Buck Naked and the Bare Bottom Boys lately. Damn, I wish I still had the CD. Great stuff. If anybody knows how to get a copy of the CD I'd greatly appreciate it. And if you haven't heard these porno-billy cats, try to track down the CD. Unfortunately Buck was shot and killed in Golden Gate Park while walking his dog about 10 years ago.
Hell, now I'm starting to think that I shoulda just called this fuckin' thing "Girls and Subways" or something. It's all I'm writing about so far...  And I guess I should keep the theme rocking with some more girls I saw at the 1st Ave. L stop tonight.  So it's around 1 am. I'm waiting for the train. My face is feeling greasy from the humidity and sweating all goddamned day. Yeah, I know I'm a sweaty bastard from time to time, but today I was extra sweaty because it the hottest, most humid day in months... Anyway, I was waiting for the L. Waiting a long time. But it didn't matter because I was standing near the stairs. All these legs started walking down the stairs. But the first pair of legs I see to really get me was this gal who really knew how to work them. Pink high heels. And this funky black with pink designs getup that showed a lot of leg. And she had that strut. I don't know, sorta like a stripper strut or something.   Then she's waiting near the edge of the platform. She's doing that thing that chicks do where they've got one hip higher than the other, really flexing the legs. And all the guys are checking her and all that bullshit. Then the train going the other way comes and makes her little skimpy one-piece get-up blow around,exposing more thigh.  She's reading the Voice. Then a section of the paper falls on the ground. She waits a few moments. And in those few moments I imagine I'll she'll pick it up. I imagine her bending over, legs stretched, exposing panty and all that. But she kind of squats, picks up the pages and puts them in the trash can.  Then there's the girl reading the latest New Yorker. She's got black jeans on. Black halter top. Black bra straps sticking out. Labyrinth Book Shop bag hanging from her left shoulder. She has lovely shoulders. And I'm thinking how I'd prefer with a girl with lovely shoulders who reads the New Yorker to that chick with the legs who reads the Voice.   Then I start thinking how none of this really matters since I'd probably never have the balls to talk to either one of them...
I was on the G Train again last night. And I've always disliked this fucking train because I've got to wait a long time. Probably the worst damn line in the NYC subway system. The only train that doesn't run into Manhattan. But what sucks is that it's the closest one to my crib.   Anyway, I'm on the train and this girl gets on. Blonde. Reminds a bit of Julie Delphy in "Before Sunrise." Incidentally, I'm reading a story a
