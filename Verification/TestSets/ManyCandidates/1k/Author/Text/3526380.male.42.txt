OK, this is getting annoying.  I can't log on to  urlLink CNN  or  urlLink MSNBC  without seeing a poll asking if Reagan's face should be put on the $10 bill.  I think there should be a general rule that a president's face cannot be on money until he has been dead for at least 50 years.  A subsection of that rule would require that everyone who was affiliated with him, fought against him in Congress, mowed his lawn, washed his car, etc, should also be deceased.  In other words, the people who have a vested interest in capitalizing on his fame or bashing him need to be out of the picture.  My opinion is that history needs at least 50 years to quietly digest the impact that a president had, good or bad, before I want to see his smiling face everytime I visit an ATM.     Really, 50 years often isn't enough.  Lets take JFK, for example.  I think the jury of history is still out on JFK.  We all felt very sad for the way he died and for the pain his wife and kids went through.  It was a really sad chapter in our history and there was enormous emotional outpouring on the part of the public.  But did he really do much as a president?  Well, ok, there was that Cuban missle crisis thing. You remember... when the world was tetering on the brink of nuclear war and JFK stood his ground with the Soviets.   Oh yeah, and the Berlin airlift thing.  The one where he prevented West Berlin from being starved into submission and JFK stood his ground with the Soviets.  Oh, and, he got into Marilyn Monroe's panties.  (that ranks as his most impressive accomplishment in my book.)  But other than that, what did he do?  Yet, you can't swing a dead cat without hitting a JFK freeway, airport, or a performing arts center.     Lets look at Jefferson.  We waited a reasonable amount of time to put his face on money.  And, yet, even to this day, it seems that there is still some new scandal surfacing almost every month.  It seems that Jefferson couldn't keep his pants zipped around his slaves.  (Although, I still think JFK could take him in the mistress department.)  Now we've got Jefferson descendents popping up everywhere.  But, hey, Jefferson was human.  I mean, its not like he sold arms to the Contras or lied to a grand jury or anything.   Now, back to Reagan.  First, let me say that I liked Ronald Reagan.  I would classify myself as a Reagan supporter for the most part. I liked his style. I liked the way he scared the hell out of the Soviets after having two decades of U.S. presidents pussy-footing around them.  The Soviets thought he was crazy and might be capable of doing anything.  He probably caused the Politburo some sleepless nights wondering if that nut in the White House was going to start bombing Moscow over a grain dispute or a lost chess match.  Of course, in the category of nailing Hollywood hotties, JFK still takes first place over Reagan.  I'm sure Jane Wyman was hot in her day, but she was no Marilyn Monroe.   By the way, Reagan already had an airport named after him before he even died.  Now there will be streets, freeways, buildings, golf courses, breakfast cereals, and God knows what else named after Reagan.    But I digress.  This issue, in my opinion, has nothing to do with whether you love him or hate him.  Lets wait 50 years or so before putting Reagan's face on our money.  He'll keep.  And in the meantime, Hamilton can hold his spot.  And who knows what interesting things we may find out about him, good and bad, after historians have a chance to dig through file cabinets for a few decades.
Pressure from the job is bearing down hard today.  No different than any other day really.  But it has been getting progressively harder and harder to keep going back into the breach each day.  Like most people, I don’t mind working and keeping busy.  In fact, I am generally happier and more satisfied with work if I am busy rather than bored with nothing to do.  But I hate being faced with nothing but a never-ending series of problems with no solutions.   I don’t mind tackling problems and finding creative solutions, but nothing will take the fight out of person faster than giving them problems with no solutions.  Or putting the solutions outside of their reach.  That is the quickest way to completely demotivate a workforce.  So I went for a walk about mid morning.  Nothing much.  Just went for a walk around the sidewalks around my office “campus” (question: is the word “campus” meant to make us feel better?  I mean, who are they kidding?  Its not like there are guys throwing frizzbees and pretty coeds lazing under trees reading books).  I’ve found myself taking these walks more and more lately.  I reach a point where I am in my office and start feeling the pressure bearing down to the point where I almost can’t breathe.  Usually it is a result of getting berated on some conference call or emails demanding solutions which are not in my power to provide.   So I go for a walk.  In my fantasy, I am running away for good.  I imagine what it would be like to start walking away and never come back.  But I do come back.  I have to come back.  In fact, usually my cell phone starts ringing if I am gone more than 5 minutes.  Ringing with people demanding solutions to problems where no solutions exist.       Recently, I was talking with my father about careers, etc, over a couple of beers.  My father is 70 years old and still still the smartest man I have ever met, no matter how old he or I get.   I pointed to my empty beer bottle and asked him, “barring an accident or abuse which would break the glass, h
