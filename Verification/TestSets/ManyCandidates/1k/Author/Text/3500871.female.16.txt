I'm tired. Really tired. Not that I'm not always tired, but you know sometimes things just get to be too much. Like math class, or work, or school all together. I live for the weekends. And this weekend was pretty awesome too. Friday night Kyle got off the bus at my house and my mom later drove us to Erin's (actually, I drove for a bit, because I have my g1 and my mom screamed because I took a corner too fast, but that's another story) In case you're wondering (which you should be), Erin and Kyle: yeah, they're my best friends. I'll tell you more about them later. So anyways, Friday was great because we basically hung out and watched Hedwig and the Angry Inch (don't ask, we have some sort of obsession with transvestites) and Kyle's dad picked the two of us up at about 11:00, which is rather early for him usually. But I'm sort of glad he picked us up so early because on the way to my house to drop me off, the car broke down. I mean, it just completely died. I remember thinking that I should have worn shoes rather than sandals and maybe a sweater would have been nice. But Kyle's dad let me sit in the car while the two guys went to see what the matter was under the hood. Needless to say, they couldn't find out and we ended up abandoning the car on the side of the road and walking for what seemed like forever until we hit a gas station that was closed, but conveniantly had a pay phone. It was kind of cool because it reminded Kyle and I of our favourite movie, Rocky Horror Picture Show. I mean, the car breaks down, they have to walk for a long time for help, and they use a phone. It all fits. So we took that oppurtunity to sing, "Over at the Frankenstein Place". Kyle's dad desperately tried to phone his mom or a cab or something and we finally got one that would agree to come pick us up from boonie-ville. We ended up waiting for 2 hours though in the freezing cold and Kyle and I had to take shelter in the phone booth. I got in at quarter to 2 and basically passed out the minute my head hit the pillow.  On Saturday Kyle and I went to Tabatha's birthday party. Erin couldn't come, which sucked because she really would have enjoyed it and she could have saved me from Emanuel's constant molesting.   Today was a good day. I woke up thinking that I just wanted to sleep all day long, but Kyle soon phoned me ruining that dream (aha..literally) and we decided to go see a film. We went to see Van Helsing, a movie which wasn't very good, but I had a great time anyways. I think Kyle was scared. He grabbed my hand really hard the first time a creature came out from the darkness. We went to Pizza Pizza for food afterwards and then he left because his dad came to drive him home... Some guy thought I was a prostitute while I was waiting for my ride to arrive, and he threw 20 dollars at me, which I joyfully grabbed and ran away with.   End of weekend analysis: I'm tired. I'm dreading school tomorrow (because I skipped on Friday and am going to get caught for that now), but I'm 20 dollars richer.
I'm so extremely tired. And you may be sitting there wondering why I am so *extremely* tired. So, what I will do is, I will tell you. I'm at the cottage right now. Doesn't sound very tiring,huh? Well it is. I just I should start with Thursday. Kyle's dad came and picked me up to spend the day hanging out with none other than.. Kyle! Haha. So I went and didn't end up going home until eleven. We walked to Tim's, we played baseball with Brett (Kyle says I have a pretty good throw for a girl. I told him he does too) and we just hung out. But yeah, I slept for awhile Friday. I was tired. And I knew I was supposed to go to Kyle's sister's dance recital (which is a really huge event-his whole family was there- everyone from grandma to second cousins haha) so Kyle called for me at about 3 and I asked him what I should wear. He told me that it was semi formal so not to dress up too much, but it's not casual. So I wore a black and white skirt and a black blouse and put my hair up. I got to Kyle's house and his sister (who answered the door in all her dance makeup) told me he was downstairs and we hung out a bit before the show, before finally going upstairs where Kyle's mom then ooed and awwed about how cute we both were and how gorgeous I looked and then his sister made the brilliant observation that Kyle and I matched (he was wearing a black shirt with a white tie). All night all his sister's friends and his grandparents and aunts kept pointing out how we matched, it was so embarassing. We went out for dinner, the lot of us after the recital. Kyle and I sat across from each other in a booth with two of his sister's friends. Then Friend A asks Alicia (his sister) if Kyle and I were dating and Alicia yelled across three tables, "KYLE IS SHE YOUR GIRLFRIEND?!" and we just looked at each other, smiled and grabbed hands across the table. He looked lovinly into my eyes, then back at Alicia and said, "She's my fiance". Later on in the evening, Kyle's dad drove us home. It was about 12:30 and we had awhile to wait in the car. Kyle grabbed my hand and we held hands the whole way although we both fell asleep several times.   I got in at 1. I had t
