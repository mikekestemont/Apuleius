I know that I have been reviewing allot of movies lately but today I wont be doing any movie reviews. Although movie related it is not a movie review.  When thinking of the horror movies I have watched lately. I said to myself why would I want to watch a movie that would chill you to the bone and make you utterly afraid. Then the subject of horror movies strangely arose during diner. After sitting through a meal where everyone shared the horror movies they had seen it made me think even more.  The reason I would often watch a horror movie is to see what the outcome is like. How these characters will triumph over thier greatest fears. Everyone loves to see a hero but a hero in a horror movie is a different hero. Not a superhero, action hero, or some amazing guy off of the pages of some manga. But they are usually cast as a normal human with problems and difficulties and failures. Like all of us.  So now matter what we are dealing with we can get a little glimmer of hope that maybe one day things will be better. That one day the monsters in are lives will be over come. No matter how big or little the trials in your lives maybe one day they will end.  Psalm 23  Philippians 4:13  Lates,  Smog
Today I saw I Robot, this movie surprised the heckl out of me. I was utterly amazing. The story was great as well as the plot twists. The cg of the robots was fantastic all the animations were sooo realistic. The whole story played out so well that you couldn't tell who the villian in the story was until the end. I was told this was a good movie by one of my friend I saw bourne with the other day and he was right.  For those who don't know I Robot is a story about one man who doesnt trust robots even though everyone says he is crazy. The robots follow three laws:      A robot cannot hurt a human being     Robots must do what they are commanded to do unless this violates the first law     A robot must protect itself from harm unless it violates the first or second law    Civilization believes that these laws will protect them but obviously they are wrong. If i say anymore i will ruin the movie.  Anyways I would rank this movie a 9/10.  Lates,  Smog  Thanks to Drew for telling advising me to go to the movie and Yuiichi for helping me with some computer stuff.
I watched the bourne supremacy again yesterday with my buddies the first time i guess i was just caught up in the motions of the movie because at the end of the day it was not as great as i previously believed the plot was rather strange. There was very little speech from our main character and bourne would often run around place to place not knowing who was chasing him and why. So he constantly asked the same repetative questions over and over making you want to shout out at him.      The sequal to me was not as great as the origonal but it was a good espionage movie and rather entertaining action movie. The plot could have been edited from the book it was taken from to make it bit more interesting but all in all it wasn't bad I would rate it 7.5/10     lates,     Smog
I just signed up for this new account and i am sooooo glad because i am always reading blogs and finally i started my own .   Tommorow I'm going to see the Bourne Supremacy with my friends.  Although this movie was good the movie i really want to see is the village. Shamalan has kept this movie very sercet and the movie looks amazing.  Hopefully it will be as good as i expect and i pray that it is not a disappointer.  lates,  Smog
I feel as if is that time again, all students know what I'm talking about that feeling like school is around the corner. How every student hate the fact they are going to go back but also embrace it because they get to hang out with thier friend again. Well thats where I'm at. I don't want to head back to school but the lazing around is starting to get to me, I do the same things every day. I sleep in then wake up to cook breakfast for my brother and sister. Sometimes I hep my Dad with work others I watch tv and then I sometimes swim in the pool. When my parents get home we have diner and then we usually go for a swim around 9 O'clock. Then I stay up until 12:30+. So where is this all going and what am I getting to..... well I don't know. Maybe it was the fact that I was glad my routine is going to be broken tommorrow as one of my best friends is coming over tommorrow maybe I just had nothing to write about. So here is a message to you Yuiichi bring mgs:tts, your laptop, Unreal 2k4, and .... I dont know anything else you want. You probably already pissed that I keep reminding you but I'm just used to King Mericon forgetting everything.  Lates,  Smog
It surprised me to hear this but Canada actually won a medal in this years summer olympics. Just yesterday our womans team won a bronze for syncronized diving. So I gues I have to write this because I was harping on the Canadians in one of my former blogs. BUt still its only one medal and Canada should still have more. We have mor money better facilities better well.... everything. It is still an imbarassment for Canadian athletes to lose so badly in the Oylmpics.  Oh yeah and on anothern note the olympics should be for amateur athletes under 25. I mean really Canada sent a woman for the shooting competion that was 53 years old. Come on (
