I would prefer if I could log on to this thing and write little happy bits all the time. But then it probably wouldn't be very interesting, all cookies and ice cream and no poop-on-a-stick.  The Giant Voice System consists of a series of towers covered top to bottom with speakers...it looks like a barnacled pier support beam rising from the desert floor. Every so often, it comes on and sounds just like the Voice Of God straight from the heavens, or at least just like that part in the  Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy  when the aliens announce they're about to destroy the Earth and all that is sacred. Last night, the Voice Of God disturbed our quiet New Year's Eve, in which we lazed about in the overheated tent while it snowed outside. We were watching Will & Grace, which I don't watch at home. But neither do I read Glamour. I do both here. Go ahead, judge me.  At any rate, Giant Voice informed us there would be a rocket attack in about four hours. I guess Johnny Taliban was kind enough to give us the exact time, and when I went into the office and sorted through the reporting, even told us what kind of rockets he'd fire, and how many. Better safe than stupid, though, so we all bundled into all our gear and huddled in the bunkers at right around midnight. Happy goddamn New Year's.  It was  cold . I'd planned to just curl up and sleep in there, but nothing doing. It was about 15F with a stiff wind. Chief (that's what we call Warrant Officers) wandered in, and we remembered we hadn't brought the phone in there, as we'd planned...then we heard it ringing in the office. He'd forgotten to switch out the cords. It was the Battalion Executive Officer, Major O, and Chief told him to call back once he'd swapped out the cords--that makes it ring in his tent. He lives with the Chaplain and Major C, the Australian. We heard it ring in his tent, and I stood outside as Chief opened the door...and there was Major C, sitting up in bed with his black knitty cap shoved high up on his head like a gangsta, demanding, " Christ, do you realize what bloody time it is??"  I stepped away from the door and laughed all the way back to the bunker, then told SGT Barnes about it, and we giggled for a good ten minutes.   I can think of other ways I'd rather spend New Year's Eve...ANYWHERE, doing just about ANYTHING else. I'll never forget it, though. And oh, by the way, after all that fuss those bastards fired not one damn rocket. So now they're telling us it could happen tonight!! Screw it, I'm staying in bed...every tiny sound, I'd jerk awake and listen for the scream of the rocket or the explosions...didn't help that our guys fired 105mm illumination rounds all night. Makes quite a racket, that Howitzer, and we're right at Ground Zero for it all, right on the edge of the airfield, about 1000m from the Howitzer position.  So this morning, sleep-deprived and with a splitting headache, I gave the platoon leaders/platoon sergeants at our mineclearing unit a briefing on the current situation, at the request of their First Sergeant. It went well, they were interested and asked great questions. Then I came back to the office, saw that only two people were there, and went back to bed. Lovely, lovely four hours I stayed asleep, punctuated by the drama of the unit we live with, their conflicts and rants. I didn't mind. You live with people, people make noise, there's no use getting your panties screwed up over it.
Wednesday's Command and Staff briefings constitute the meat and potatoes of my job as an intelligence officer. That's when the battalion staff and the company commanders report to the battalion conference room for formal updates from all the staff sections. My job is to be the unit's subject matter expert on the enemy--their techniques, tactics, and procedures, their significant activities, any trends that have developed, their weapons, and then what it all means/what could come next.  I love it.  I spend my days sifting through the classified reports, and I pull out what I think our unit needs to know, analyze it all, and present it in a user-friendly fashion. I like to really get down into the weeds, pull down maps, get pictures of weapons and the bad dudes who have them, etc.   I brief an abbreviated version every day to the Battalion Commander and the staff, then the big show on Wednesdays. I think my briefing is the only one everyone perks up and listens to--I get a fair number of questions and no one looks at their watch. Today I got down into the forces and factors behind the two attempts to assassinate President Musharref of Pakistan (which would mean trouble for our efforts here, believe me) and the "suicide bombing" near Kabul International Airport. I don't necessarily think it was supposed to be a suicide bombing, but that's just my opinion. Both events are in opensource media, so NO, none of this is classified.  Go somewhere else for your info, Osama, you punk-ass rat bastard!   The rest of the week I feel as though I'm the officer everyone sees taking up space in the office, on the computer all day--it looks like I'm not doing anything much, while all these Engineer officers run around tending to the business of clearing minefields. I feel vindicated on Wednesdays--I really have become an expert on Al-Qaida, the Taliban, and Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin (called the HIG), which is the Other White Meat. They're the terrorist organization no one hears about. It's a group of (mostly) Afghans who are loyal to Hekkmatyer Gulbuddin, the former Prime Minister of Afghanistan. They like to shoot rockets at folks, but I don't think they've carried out anything substantial as of yet. A-Q is easy to identify, they're the foreigners s
