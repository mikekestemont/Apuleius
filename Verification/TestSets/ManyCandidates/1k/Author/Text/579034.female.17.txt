Yea... I had a pretty boring day. I mean, I was up late talkin to some people on line, went to bed around 5. I woke up at 1:01 and then I went online. I have nothing else to do with my life (lol). But tonite Melly is sleeping over, and as I told Mike Ryan (Penis to his friends) we are going to have mad wild lezbian sex. But if we are too filled up on pizza then we are going to rent a few movies. It'll be fun.
Hey all... every one has these post things lately and I thought I'd go ahead and get one too cause, hey, it seems the "it" thing right now (heehee). Anyways, I am Lauren, I am 16 from Staten Island, New York, and this is my blog. Get ready for an interesting read, cause I mean, its my life, and reading about other peoples lives (especailly lives with all the things that mine has) is fun! Well, right now I guess nothing too interesting has happend. I just went outside to get the mail and there was none. Now wasn't that just riveting? Tonight I'm taking my friend Melanie (Melly) out for her birthday (HAPPY BIRTHDAY MELLY!) with her boyfriend (Greg), my boyfriend (also a Greg) and our firend Gerard and his girl Jen. Should be a good do I reckon (sorry too much Harry Potter). More on how that goes later! Right now I'm going to figure out how to work this blog thingy so talk to you later! Peace xox

Well, yesterday I went to Vinny Fea's house with Debra, Mariana, Laura, Vin, John, Doofy and Rob. It was hella fun. We swam, played Marco Polo, slid down the slide, threw balls at each other. Good times, good times. It's apology time, once again, twice in three days. I am so sorry to all my friends.

Okay this post is an aopolgy to Greg who I really offended. He was being very good about me going to Feas house tomrrow and he told me to have a good time and I said "You say that but you really want me to have a bad time so when I tell you, you can be like 'See you should have spent the day w/ me'" which was TOTALLY out of line. Greg I am so sorry. I love you, please don't be mad at me.
Hey there everyone! I'm back from Florida!!!! I have had the best time EVER!! It has deffinitly been ranked in the top 5 of vacations I have taken. Well the first day there was really boring. Just me and my mom shopping. I got a really nice bathing suit there though. Then the second day Derrick and his family came. I met him there last year so at least knew each other. We hung out that day making more friends. Me, him, his brother and sister all hung out with the other people there. By the like thrid day of vactaion we had a huge posse of people. It was so great! They were all so... just... awesome. I mean  I knew these people for one week and it felt like I knew them my whole life! I would take a bullet for any of these people. James and Shawn were from Canada. James does the BEST immitation of Dr. Evil I have EVER heard in my whole life. He could take over for Mike Myers. Elliot is from England. He was really cute, he had the cutest accent (Fuckkin wanka!). I met him at casino night at the hotel. Then there was the Matt from Conetticut. He was really cool. H
