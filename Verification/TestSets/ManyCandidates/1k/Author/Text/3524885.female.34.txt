Finally I was able to do the first few slides of our wedding proposal.  This is very important for me and Joey since this will set the direction on our wedding plans. Just like any other big event, it should start with a proposal.  A proposal is good when people get the full idea and the total picture in one passing.  And I guess our wedding proposal should be that way! Strategic, creative and paints the picture.  I have a simple outline for this.   The title page  I was able to craft a very witty title which applies to me and Joey very well. It goes...  Jane & Joey:  Our New Chapter, 20 Years After               2005 Wedding Plans  I am sure everyone will ask "Why 20 years?" So, the next slide will be a glimpse on how it all started 20 years ago and how it will be sealed with a beautiful wedding after 20 years to begin or continue our new chapter as a couple.  Oh, how I love it!   1st Part  Here, since we will be presenting to our families, I devoted a few slides to let them know Joey and me (for the family of Joey.)  Title goes:  Let's Meet Joey              Who is he?  Then next slide shows a brief biography of Joey with pictures. Then after this slide are his pictures when we were still in elementary and highschool. Then Joey at present.  A few slides will de devoted for me, too (for the sake of Joey's family)in the same flow as Joey's.   2nd Part: Theme This part will be strongly supported by picture references   3rd Part: The Plans  Here I will put the wedding date, venues, entourage list, principal sponsor list, references for the gown, etc. This will be the longest part as the wedding details will be discussed here.   4th Part: The Suppliers  List of all suppliers we will use plus sample of their works.   5th Part: Your Part in Our Wedding  Here I will put the responsibilities we need to assign to our families and relatives.  We want them to be part of the preparations, too. And this will be the portion where they can make suggestions on how else to make the celebration meaningful and joyful.  I was able to finish only up to Joey's part.  I have to put a lot of effects per page. That is why it took such a long time. But I was very satisfied with the results.  I can't wait to finish this proposal. Joey will be here on Thursday and it has to be ready by that time.  Then, we will show this powerpoint presentation to my family and his family as represented by Noel, his brother, in the afternoon of June 27.  It will be a big family gathering from my side since everyone is just so excited to meet Joey. There will be lots of food (yum!) and it will go on until dinner time. Yipee I'm so excited!   On a separate note, we were able to chat with some highschool batchmates today -- Jun, Trupel, Kai then me and Joey.  We had fun laughing our hearts out with Trupel who is a declared gay.  He revealed that he had a crush with Joey when we were still in school and he was really funny.  Joey rode with the flow of conversation and he was very game, too, and it made the chat livelier. Hope to chat with them again.  Joey and I are both excited on the upcoming wedding.  It's a year and half of preparation left and soon, panic time will come. But, first things first.  This coming June 21, 22 and 23, we look forward to spending quality time at the heavenly  urlLink Pran Havana  at Pranburi.  I need the break after so many months of hard work and being away from Joey.  And I want Joey to relax, too. I can't wait to get on that place and spend the rest of the 3 days just with my Joey. I'm sure, we will do nothing but stare in the beach and be lazy all day long. For once, we will not think of work...
urlLink    1st Bridal Gown Trial @ Queen Sirikit Wedding Fair&nbsp; urlLink      It is not yet my dream gown but it was significant because it was my first time to try on a BRIDAL GOWN!  We'll, it's not everyday that I get the chance to prepare a wedding, right?  Pia and I went to see the Bridal Fair at Queen Sirikit last May 30. Being stuck here in Bangkok with no real source of good wedding ideas, we tried out that one hoping we will get some samples, ideas, just like the way they do it Manila.    It was a disappointment because most of the suppliers are for photography and bridal gowns which are mostly for rent. Thais do not have the concept of buying bridal gowns. So, Pia and I tried on a few gowns just for the heck of it and of course to see if we will look great on them. I tried on this particular one because I like the mandarin collar. With my fusion theme, this is the collar i want exactly but sexier with a haltered cut to reveal my nice shoulders and make it really low at the back. The cloth materials are fabulous and they do the embroideries really well.  The best part is that it is very affordable. So, the bride-to-be's got possessed and started collecting their business cards so we can call them in the future.  One thing I discovered that I really like is the Wedding Book. This photographer from  urlLink Sa-Guan Foto  studio has the style I like.  She take candid, dynamic shots of the entire event and compose a carefully and beautifully art directed page by page wedding book!  It is much much better than a photo album. She gave us a packaged cost of 35,000 Baht. It costs 500 Baht per page if I will just provide her the pictures in CD format.  I
