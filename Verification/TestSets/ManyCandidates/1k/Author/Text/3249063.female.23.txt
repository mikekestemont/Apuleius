Well, here I am on a freakin' HOLIDAY at school waiting on this boring class to start. I really hate the fact that we have class today, but I have to accept it because there is really nothing that I can do about it. Plus, it is necessary because our classes only go for 6 weeks and every week is critical since we only go once a week. Maybe I should suck it up.  I had a great weekend. I had a fun filled Saturday. I worked for a while, then I went shopping and took myself to a fancy dinner. Then I went back to O-town for a bit....stopped at the bar and had a few cocktails at around 6ish or so. I know I said that I was going to cut down on my drinking, and I have, but Saturday was the perfect day for amaretto Sours. I had 3 and then I went home and took a nap for an hour. Then, I woke up and got freshened up to go party in KC. I had a blast. Every Saturday at King Louie (bowling, pool, arcades), they have Xtreme bowling from midnight to 3am. It is where they have a DJ and the lights are off and all of the bowling pins are neon and glow in the dark. It is like a club in a bowling alley. They also have a bar. Anyway, it is 13 bucks to get in , but that covers everything (unlimited bowling and pool for 3 hours, plus a great dj). The bar stays open til 1 or 2 and you can bring your drink to the pool tables or bowling lanes. It was a lot of fun and it may very well be my Saturday night hangout. So, I hung out with a friend after bowling until like 5am, then I drove back to O-town and made it back by 6:15am. Since it was already daybreak, I stayed awake all day Sunday and hit the sack at 10 last night. I slept like a baby.  Today I don't get to enjoy the holiday because I am at school. I am taking off work on Wednesday....maybe I'll make up for it then....who knows?   That's all for now
Whew!!!! It's hotter than a hooker on a Friday night outside. I hate it so bad. I think I need to move to the North Pole or something. Nothing much going on here. Been working all day, not complaining because it's been a good day-for the most part. I switched my insurance company to a company in Ottawa-why did I do that? I thought that my premium would go down? No, it went up a few bucks because they noticed a speeding ticket I got last summer. Plus, they talked me into getting a renter's insurance policy in the event that my apartment is burglarized or burned down....So I did it. I think it is beneficial just in case an unexpectancy occurs. I think every renter needs renters insurance....Just in case.   Well, I had a VERY late night last night, but it was awesome and a lot of fun. I don't regret staying out so late-even though I had to wake up at 7 to make it to work by 8am. I made it to be at like 345 and woke up at 7 in a great mood.   Houston (my guinea pig) is getting more attached to me. He used to hide in his igloo if he heard me come in the door. Now, he comes to the door of the cage when he hears the door so that I can pick him up. He is also showing emotion to express that he dislikes when I am not there. This proves to my many friends that consider him a rodent, that he is a normal pet.   Well, I am outta here for now.
I have made the decision to buy myself a wonderful gift when I graduate with my Master's in January. I have to start saving now, though. Oh well. I'll try. I have ALWAYS wanted a sporty bright orange motorcycle. I love motorcycles ( the smaller ones). So my plan is to get my buy one for myself when I complete my degree. I can't wait. I have also been thinking of places to move to. Until this week I was certain that Dallas was the place for me. Dallas is still top on the list, but there is so much out there.   The Lakers game is coming on soon- so that is all for now
This has been another busy day, but I am not complaining at all. I like it that way most of the time. My life is smooth sailing right now, for the most part. Back to normality for once. Things seem to working in my favor in all aspects of my life and I am thankful for that. My relationship with my family is on the rocks for many different reasons, but I am sure they will eventually work out.  Work is going good. I had to ride to a meeting in COffey COunty yesterday with the Executive Director of the organization that I work for. She is a powerful lady and can be intimidating. So, it was just us two in the car and she praised me and my productivity the entire time. It made me feel good. we talked about personal issues as well as work related ones and it made me feel really comfortable.   I haven't really had much social interaction with anyone lately. I kinda like it but I kinda miss it too. I am glad that my friendship with a good friend is back on track. For a while, my friendship with LaShawn was shaky because of a situation he put himself in. Before he got into it, he would call daily and we would hang out about three times a week. Well, for a while, our contact was non-existant and I started feeling like the friendship was gone. Well, last night, I was planning o
