i'm officially going to Italy in August!  for 2 weeks!!!  and i get to go to tabi and jordan's wedding. gotta get those tickets so i can be sure to be there.  august is going to be a fun month!
so it's come to my attention that you have to have a password to comment.  what's that all about? i didn't make up a password. but i'm on it. i'll figure it out eventually!  until then just email me and let me know whats up i guess. and asha - we still need to chat!  i got it worked out - but just make sure you put your name on the post cause i guess you have to post it anonymously. so i want to know who you are when you say something!
hey everyone. here's my new Debbie's Days.  i wanted to make some changes to how it all looked and couldn't do that without losing all of your precious comments!  so this is where all my new posts will go unless i get enough complaints and then i will go back to the old one. the old one is the link above if you want to read any of the posts from the months before now.

hey everyone. this is the first day of summer break for the kiddies.  they both have playdates this morning though. and tomorrow and friday i am OFF cause the family is going into DC for the weekend! so i'm pumped about getting to sleep in and relax in the middle of the week. then next week starts camps and swim teams and fun times.  only 9 days till i get back to ohio. i will be in columbus from 9pm friday night until around 3 or 4 on saturday. brent and i have to get back for his friend's 4th of july party.  it's this really big deal.  and then brent and i are volunteering at camp on sunday for registration!!! i keep forgetting we are doing that, but luckily brent remembers. alright, time for my shower and then off for the day of running around with the munchkins! love you all
so summer is getting here. the kids only have 3 more days of school! then i'm not sure how i'm going to fit int the laundry and the grocery shopping while being with the kids at the club all day. i'm sure i'll figure it out but it might take a week or two of trial and error.  only 15 days till i get to go home to ohio then on vacation with brent and his family! i'm so excited!
hey everyone. today has been a rainy day. the kids are either at school or a dr's appointment so i'm doing the kids laundry and trying to get some reading done.  i still need to DESPERATELY do my laundry, but who knows when that will happen.  my friend cassi may be coming to ohio with me when i come in for tabi and jordan's wedding.  brent probably will be working still during the wedding so cassi will probably be my date. i'm excited for her to meet all my friends and see where i lived.  but that all depends on what her job situation is like. so she might not be able to come in then, but hopefully sometime.  not much else is going on. i'm hoping to take the kids to the zoo sometime next week since they are done with school on tuesday and dont start their camps and swim team till the following week.  i may be getting a haircut but i'm not completely decided yet and cassi and i are starting a one-on-one study - we are reading mere christianity first and then we'll go on to another book. let me know how you all are doing! (MORGAN - i got the invite to your party but sadly i will be in connecticut - or i was depending on when the party is ... i forget ... but thanks for the invite!!)
so there is a hazardous waste day this saturday in greenwich, ct (about 10 minutes from my house) and i just don't get it. what do you do at hazardous waste day?  do the kids get to jump in big piles of hazarous waste? is there bobbing for apples?  are they celebrating hazardous waste or saying we need less of it? well, sorry folks - i know you all want the scoop but i will not be attending hazardous waste day. i will be helping cassi pack. if you could keep her in your prayers that would be great. she is still looking for a job and hasn't had any calls back yet.  she's getting a little anxious.  and she's a really awesome person so she deserves it! all i had to do was mention that i was homesick and she was like "well what are you doing tongiht?" and i was babysitting but she came over after i put the kids to bed and we talked for like an hour just so i didn't feel so lonely.
so i'm homesick again. i think i just need to get out in the middle of the week.  cause my weekends are great and i'm happy, but during the week i feel really isolated.  i think i am getting out tomorrow night which is good.    i'm trying to get into a workout routine, and it just isn't working. i either want a nap instead (cause that's REAL active) o
