the girl on reception has decided she likes the OTHER IT guy after he came down to fix our PC yesterday. what are we like? we had a right laugh with him and basically told him he and the other bloke were knobs for not saying hello to us as they walk past. so today i got a huge "hello" bellowed at me from him as they walked across reception.. I think the one I like is a mute (at least around women)...a sexy bloke who doesnt talk, i think i may have found "The One"!! Went to a wedding on Friday night and got slightly hammered..the reason I know this is, I was dancing to "Wake me up before you Go-Go" at 2 in the morning and i knew ALL the words. Somebody bought me a pint of Bulmers (which is a cider for those of you that dont know) so I looked every inch the classy bitch supping on me pint of cider and dancing to Wham like a woman possessed!..and I wonder why I cant get a bloke! I had to become "Sensible Lou" that night as my mate decided she wanted to sow her seeds (pre-moving in with the boyfriend jitters im guessing) so I had to stop her running down the middle of the Dual carriageway to a party with her "what-if guy"..and for a teeny drunk girl in a pair of Stilletoes, she could bloody move!! honestly, i understand where shes coming from but ive been there where you go back to see if the spark is still there and it hasnt worked out for me..in fact i ended up wanting to kill him.... so it was either rugby tackle her to the ground and see her home in a taxi, or have to go to the party with her and make sure she didnt do anything stupid. I chose the first option, although I didnt have to tackle her to the ground, just grab her arm and link her across the road. its a sad day when your friend says to you "god when did you become so bloody sensible" i think i'll book my place in the "home for the elderly" now....
forget lesbianism.... i hate fish
Was over the other side of the building chatting to someone and on my way back from a meeting and was heading back to my office, so i swiped myself through the door and walked straight into "hot guy" and his mate on their way home..did i smile flirtily and say "ooh skivving off early are we?" Did I heck?! I blushed profusely,smiled but barely made eye contact with the bloke I DO fancy as I giggle like a bloody schoolgirl everytime i do, so i ended up saying something stupid like "oooooh helloooooooooooooooo there!! and trying to do my best "shake my ass walk" down the corridor, but probably ended up walking more like my arse was broken!! I never walk into him! and totally wasnt expecting it, having said that..if he'd have walked into 5 minutes later I'd have had a plethora or wonderful flirty lines to throw his way..hindsight is a wonderful thing isnt it?! and whats worse is that i think the OTHER bloke thinks I fancy him because I'm always nice to him (because I'm hoping he'll go upstairs and say "that Louise is a right laugh, you should ask her out") I've been dating seriously for 6 years and I havent figured out that men arent the same as women! he more than likely goes up and says "that one downstairs has a right good pair of knockers" I really am a lost cause! had a great night last night though, met up with all my mates to make a Wedding Album for a friends wedding (we're taking pictures of her from school with songs, poems etc) we met at 7 and by half 11 we hadnt done anything and had spent the entire time laughing at pictures of us in school! I swear I couldnt breathe I was laughing so hard. I had glasses that would put Deirdre Barlow to shame! and oh, the fashions..we thought we looked the business when in fact we looked like a load of mexican refugees running across the border (with awful haircuts and runner boots with the tongues out!!). The cast of Saved by the Bell were clearly our fashion roll-models (although none of us had the wonderful baggy pants that A.C. Slater had..not for the lack of trying though! and the corkscrew perms! OH THE HORROR!!! i was fortunate enough to have a good hairdresser who wouldnt put a perm in my hair because i wasnt old enough (i thank her everyday to the roots of my poker straight hair)..instead I had to settle for curlers anytime I wanted my hair in ringlets..those bloody wormy things you wrap around your hair and have to sleep in (its like lying on a bag of spanners) so you wake up and you're in theory supposed to have a head full of wonderful bouncy(yet natural) curls. Instead, what I ended up wtih was the nickname "socket-girl"..as in, my hair looked like I had been playing with one..... Vicious bastards!
I have decided I am to give up on men..my IT hottie has walked past 4 times today and I got a "Hey Louise", albeit a rather quiet one! He has walked past 4 times and the other times I've totally clammed up and have seen him out of the corner of my eye looking over but I reckon thats just because he was bored while waiting for the lift, and all times he's walked past I've kept my head down because I dont want to seem to eager! EAGER!! im bloody desperate!!! I'd hop over the desk and ride him all the way home if I thought he'd be up for it!
Was driving to work this morning, laughin at a skit on the radio when i turned onto the dual carriageway..i was on the outside lane as I
