Debbie awoke at the usual hour for her "non-working" periods, about 12:00am, the cats were howling for food and to be let out. She stumbled into the living room of her small flat, falling over a bag of rubbish she had failed to put out the night before on the way to turn on the computer. Her little clan of cyber friends would hopefully have written something to lift her spirits while she slept. She needed it, after reading&nbsp;yet another letter about some&nbsp;huge sum of money the bliffs were after her for&nbsp;, money she didn't have. She looked around at her scant material posessions, nothing for them to take instead of money. "Maybe they'll accept my blood" she thought and chuckled to herself as she envisioned the horrified look on the baliffs face&nbsp;as she&nbsp;slashed her right wrist in front of him and offered him some.&nbsp;&nbsp; the computer finally connected to the internet, and she sipped her first cup of tea. Not much had happened in her cyber community after she had retired it seemed, no new posts. She made a few token ones herself, sighed and went out in search of work just like she did everyday.
He's got a new girlfriend, his ex-apprentice, great, he dumped me for another woman before we even met! Can life be any crueler?  He did finally talk to me and we're still friends, and I will get to meet him, he's coming to England for a holiday. All for the best really, we'd probably have just fucked each others lives up anyway. At least he's talking to me again, and we're still friends. Well I'm going away tomorrow to WOMAD, it should be a good one, as I said previously, got my weed Wooo! I'm just going to go away and try not to think about it all for a few days.&nbsp;
I just deleted all johnnys PM's, it was harder than&nbsp;I thought it would be after the way he's acted. He sounds so loving in some of them, I wonder now if it was just some way to scam me. Good knows how, I've got nothing but a place for him to stay if he wanted it and my love if he deserved it. Suppose that's enough for some blokes. This is so gutting for me,&nbsp;I really thought there was something between me and this guy, but I'm obviously dispensible to him really. There's a chance he's just getting his head together, but I'm really starting to doubt that now. He's blown me out for sure, and I don't really understand why, if he was telling me the truth about not being angry. I hate it when any kind of relationship ends with no closure, even this one with a geezer I'd never even met. I must be a complicated person to have such a complicated life.&nbsp;
Well i'm going away again soon, that's a relief, get away from this damn Island for a while. Johnny's still not talking to me, his loss, hahaha. I hope we can talk again one day though, and he tells me what the hell I did.   When I go away at least I can&nbsp;forget about him for a&nbsp;few days, there's a load of cool people going, so it should be a great one. I'm so lucky really, to have such good friends, who are real! I shouldn't get so hung up over my internet friends, but it was different with Johnny, I'm really gutted its all gone weird, and just hope its something temporary.&nbsp; Depends what kind of bloke he is really I suppose, whether he's stubborn enough, Dave held out for months&nbsp;I remember! with an internet relationship like this he could easily just forget about me, that would be hard.&nbsp;But I must keep remembering, the&nbsp;last thing he said to me was he's not angry, He just needed time to sort his head out. He's taking a bloody long time about it! Which isn't promising, or maybe it is, I just don't know. I'm thinking this is his way of dumping me, which is a downer, since we never even met! I have a feeling about him though, I know&nbsp;I will meet him, and something good will come of it.&nbsp;I just hope I'm not deluding myself, I hope he doesn't turn up and become a complete nightmare I wish I'd never met! I don't know what to do now, all&nbsp;I can do is wait now.
Starting to like having a place I can just come and type my thoughts self indulgently, it's cool, and easier than hand writing with a Parker pen!&nbsp;I can just come here at any hour and write what the hell I like and, there's very little chance any bastard will ever read it, there are so many out there.   The internet is a strange place, people can hide and create whole new characters for themselves, and try to mess with you if they want. But there are some good folk out there, and its amazing to talk to people all over the world like I do. And I've made some friends, though they are shadowy and weird sometimes! I always seem to find the weirdo's, probably because I am one, we are attracted to each other cosmically perhaps.   I shouldn't worry so much about people, only they can sort there own shit out at the end of the day. And its there loss if they lose contact with me isn't it really?
Well the past few days have been weird, other people are so strange. I can see why people become hermits now, maybe I will. Go and live in a cave somewhere, and eat berries and nuts and what vegetables I can cultivate. and drink rainwater, and trap small animals to cook on a fire. Just have to wait now till Johnny decides he wants to talk to me again, weirdo that he is. I hope the silly bastard is going to sort his shit out and make it over here ok, if he doesn't I will feel partially responsible. If I hadn't been involved, i'm s
