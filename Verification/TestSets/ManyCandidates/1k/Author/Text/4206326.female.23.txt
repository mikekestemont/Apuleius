I was digging around looking for something else and ran accorss this, very dark, very accuret, very hard to read thing I wrote a long long time ago. Wanted to post it so I'm pressed to continue.   Haight Street By me... duh.  The house was dark. The rain clung to my windowpanes like teardrops on broken lovers cheeks. All I could hear was the sound of flesh flapping on the linoleum, the cracks of the belt, and the pounding night. There were the muffled confused sobs after each snap that broke the otherwise paralyzed air. 	I could only tell my door snuck open because of the sudden soft waft of cold air I felt crawl across my face and sudden increase of tension in the room. I could feel her feet climbing the wooden ladder just behind my head, and I could hear the bolts and beams moan under her stress and she climbed into her bed above me. I could hear her bring her breath under control, until finally the room was still. 	I lay stiff for a while, as all frightened children do. Covers pulled tight to the chin, eye’s wide and searching, trying desperately to summon the courage to close them again. Trying desperately to understand what was going on, trying desperately to understand why it was happening. I focused on the bleeding sky outside again, and the crawling fingers of water gripping at the window.  	When the moments of silence in the room added up into a dense knot in my stomach, I rolled onto my side and closed my eyes and tried not to think anymore.  “It’s not your fault,” She whispered. 	I tried not to cry, and went to sleep.  In the morning my sister and I acted as if the nights downpour had washed away our memories like we knew we had to. She had learned long before how to dress in a way that the clothing wouldn’t bind over the welts, and how to avoid situations where she may get touched where her wounds were. I had learned that we didn’t talk about it before I learned to talk.
I think I've secured my spot in the Scorpio club with all the dark somberness anyone can handle, so it's time for something compleatly different. [cackle - geeky referance allert]  I have this little experiment that I want to conduct, and I'd love it if others out there did it too, to get a good survey.  Ok, Pick 5 or 6 large charches in or around your city. Go to confession and confess the same sin, write down what the pennance is for each church. This way all people will know where to go to get the best bang for you buck, so to speak.  would be really interesting to see the contrasts within a single church as well.  yes, It could be said that this is extreemly disrespectful of other religions, and I have to dissagree. because I in no way am insulting or demening any institution that builds so  many bad-ass buildings that would make excellent bars. as long as your respectfull, no harm no foul  And If there is a hell that I'm going to rot in, at least they'll have taquilla and AC, thank you very much.
Floater - Out of Sight  Looking back accross the years, At a million unshed tears, How could I have held them all? And Oh, the price I paid, for all the love I never made, Someone wrote up on the walll.  "Oh, how mighty is my pen, If this is everywhere it's been?" Yes the wines delicious but I'm needing something stronger, I growing suspicious that I woun't be here much longer And it feels like I'm going down again. It feel like I've lost my ownly friend.  Crawling home from some saloon, And all my strings are out of tune, no one's around to break my fall. No attempt was ever made, So I slowly decade have a little faith in me that's all.  How mightly am I then,  If this is everywhere I've been And as the daylight broke I cast no shadow on the wall, I will disinigrate untill there's nothing left at all Feels like I'm going down again, Feels like I've lost my only friend.  And I never thought I see the day My heros all became phycotics My drugs are all exspensive exotics My blood is thick with antibiotics So I toss the coin to fate, it's only right Take no blame so I can sleep so tight, You know that out of mind is also out of sight.  And as the laylight broke I cast no shadow on the wall I pass the closed apartment door in rows along the hall Feels like I'm going down again, feels like I've lost my only friend.
I'm tired to looking for you in the rearview mirror.  looking for a shillowette that reminds me of that night. I'm tired of wondering if you wonder like me, about me, about you.  I'm ready to let go, and yet there is nothing to replace you. The part you me that you took is still gone, and I'm not sure I want it back. After what I leared about myself from you.   Sometimes loosing yourself in someone is the best way of learing what is left behind. What is left behind? Is it a wiser, more complete self? or just a slightly more fragmented puzzel that's missing a piece it didn't need?  Perhaps that's the Blank Rune. The unknowable, the undecided, the everchaning dark logic that only follows the rules it makes up as it goes along the way, dragging us kicking and screaming, into the light.
Everyone has done this. Someone has just said something to you, and you heard and understood it, yet you have to stop, re-process what was just said to you, just to form a lucid response. To frequently we have our shilds up - so strong that that we can't even pay attention to what is going on outside o
