The End is Nigh   Dear Atlanta,  I’m leaving you.  That’s one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to write.  But I felt that I owed you an explanation, some sort of reason why this is ending.  I love you, more than I’ve loved anything.  For the last eight years, you have been home to me.  You helped me build a life, independent of my family.  You helped me shed my childhood; you’ve gently coaxed me into womanhood.  You filled my life with activities, friends, and great loves.  And while I was with you, I never once wondered what else there could be for me outside of your arms.  You entertained me, challenged me, and educated me.  And for this I will always be grateful.  But you and I both know that things have been different for a while.  After I graduated, I felt lost.  And you didn’t understand.  I didn’t have a job, I was running out of money, and I needed you.  I needed your help and support.  But you ignored me.  You just continued to act like everything was normal, when we both know that it wasn’t.  And while you were out having fun, I met someone else.  I met Washington, D.C.  And for a moment I believed D.C. was what I needed.  D.C. is actually not too much different from you, Atlanta.  But D.C. was older.  And with that age came the maturity and refinement that I believed that I wanted.  I saw D.C. a couple of times and I actually thought that I could be happy in D.C.’s arms, that I could be content.    But that’s not who I’m leaving you for.  I actually fell for one of your neighbors.  I fell for Albany.  Can you believe it?  I fell for what you would consider a “country bumpkin”!  And I will admit, Albany isn’t you.  Albany isn’t refined and is surprisingly young; not too much younger than you, but not the type that I would normally fall for.  I know you will never understand what the attraction is between Albany and myself.  I don’t expect anyone will.  Albany is utterly lacking in sophistication.  But that’s only on the surface; it’s also lacking in pretension.  Albany doesn’t demand from me more than I can give.  Albany helped me find a job, and understands that sometimes I prefer cuddling on the couch to sipping martinis at Vision.  Albany remembers my name, knows who I am.  You’re so busy rushing back and forth that sometimes I don’t even think you see me.  And that’s the most important thing in the end.  Simply put: Albany isn’t as busy as you are.  You’re so jammed with a steady stream of traffic coming in and out your door, Atlanta.  And these people just keep coming, crowding me out of your life.  But Albany makes time for me and I love Albany for that.  So, I’m leaving on Monday.  I’m moving in with Albany for a while.  I’ll be back in late October to pick up my stuff.  I hope that you can understand why I have to leave.  It’s time for me to grow, and the only way that I can do that is to put some distance between us.  I hope that we can still be friends.  Please know that you will always be one of the most important things in my life and that I will never forget what we have shared.  I love you more than you will ever know.    Forever,  Curvy P.S.- I’ll let you know if things don’t work out between us.  ;)
Legal News or a Short Trip   There's something that's been consuming me lately.  A sort of nameless dread that numbs my fingers and toes and is the cause of my stomach's current acrobatic prowess.  My future may or may not be about to officially begin.  After four years of college, four years of law school, and an unfortunate amount of debt, I was sure that I was ready for this moment.  In fact, I would have killed for it about 3 months ago.  I knew as I walked across that stage in May, that I was walking into my adulthood.  I was no longer on the cusp of "not a girl, not yet a woman," rather, I was moving into a phase where a job with benefits was the goal and the only phone calls I would be making to my parents were hear about the joys of retirement, not to direct them to the nearest Western Union.  But today it's a different story.  Tomorrow I will find out if I'm moving.  To Albany.  Georgia.  If you've never heard of it, that's okay.  I hadn't heard of it either until last month.  My possible future boss told me that I had the job, but that my future job is contingent on a vacancy opening up by a man named Troy.  Troy has an interview at 10 a.m. on Tuesday . . . as in this Tuesday.  And by 11 a.m., my life and Troy's will either begin a new chapter, or we'll both continue writing the run-on sentence of the chapter already in progress.   I may not have the job, but my mind has been in Albany for weeks.  I spend the day pouring over apartment listings, movers, and newcomer information.  I eagerly pour over the Albany Herald online and profess shock at the presence of only one Starbucks in a town of over 30,000.  I've been furniture shopping, appliance shopping, and clothes shopping.  I've created a life in my mind and that life is firmly committed to Albany, Georgia.  And I've managed to terrify myself in the process.  I've become a poltergeist.  Not quite in one place, but rather stuck in a limbo of duality: trying to be in two places at once is emotionally draining to say the least.    I'm writing this because I know that tomorrow this will all be over.  I will have my exorcism.  I will feel the quiet relief spread throughout as I discover whether my life is b
