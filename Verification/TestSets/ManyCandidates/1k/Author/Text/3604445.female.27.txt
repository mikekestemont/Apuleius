Well here we are in the great state of Oklahoma! Quaide and I got here Saturday night and yesterday we went to our home church to see all of our friends. Everyone was so excited to see us and very warm and welcoming. Being Father's Day, after church we headed to my sisters house for lunch and a nap before heading back to church for the evening service. Man, this reminds me how fast pace our lives used to be when we lived here. We're just sliding right back into the pace of things. Today we don't have anything planned, just hanging out with my Mom and doing some running around. Quaide hasn't had much of an appetite so right now he's munching on some strawberries. They definitely are not as good as Oregon's but let me tell you about the watermelon we had yesterday....it was sooo good!  Last night we had such a HUGE thunder and lightning storm. It was kinda scary as I am out of experience with these. It kept me up most of the night and Quaide came toddling in to my room right before it started and then preceded to sleep through it. I was thankful for that. The wind was blowing so hard and the rain was pelting the windows, it fell like it was going to break them. But I finally fell asleep, only to be awoken by the cat howling in the back yard and the alarm beeping as my dad went outside to tend to it. Mom and Dad's new house is beautiful. It's still kind of weird for me, it's all of their stuff but just doesn't feel quite like home yet. I'm sure it will be a different story in a few days. Everything's so new and clean, I don't want Quaide to mess anything up. Well, I need to get going, I've got a birthday party to plan!
Today was a beautiful and busy day. We started out by going to Mt.Tabor Park and meeting some new friends. Danielle and her son Jack, Amy and her daughter Elliott, and another mother and her son whom I cannot remember their names for the life of me. They both had unusual names and I couldn't even remember them to say goodbye with but I hope we see them all again after we get back from our trip to Oklahoma. Quaide had such a great time being around other children. Danielle and Jack met us for lunch at Peanut Butter and Ellies and although the wait was ridiculous (though completely normal for this place)the boys enjoyed playing together on the train and coloring on the walls with the chalk. I took some of Quaide's baby clothes over to Zanzibar Consignment Store which is two doors down, trying to get some extra cash for our upcoming week. It was so hard letting go of some of his precious little outfits. Anyway, on the way home Quaide fell asleep and slept all the way through me carrying him upstairs to his bedroom. After his nap, we went to Target to buy him a little cheapo plastic swimming pool. I wanted something for him to cool off in as it will be getting up to 90 degrees in the next 2-3 days. We don't have air conditioning which is pretty normal here in Oregon but with us having our rooms in the attic area, it gets really hot, really fast. Oklahoma is going to be much hotter but as long as I have air conditioning, I can survive.

urlLink    We went fishing at Hagg Lake today. Despite the cool temperature and the wind, and the fact that none of us caught a single fish, we had a pretty decent time. 6-13-04&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    The Parade has passed by and he is all tuckered out, but he has made sure to secure the balloon from flying out the window before drifting of to dreamland!&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    This, of course, was Quaide's favorite float. He is really into crocodiles lately. He says "Crikey it's a Croc!"- like the Crocodile Hunter!&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Had a great time at the Portland Rose Festival Parade this morning. It amazed me how there were people who literally pitched a tent and camped out to get a good seat. We showed up about 20 minutes late and were able to stand pretty close. Good times...good times!&nbsp; urlLink
I have to write this down before I forget. Morning times truely are some of the best times with Quaide. It's a clean slate and he's usually so sweet and has his dreams fresh in his mind. So, I always pick his brain to see what he comes up with. This morning he started to tell me a story and this is how it went: "The little baby shark said, 'Where's my Mommy?' and the Daddy Shark said, 'Shhh. She's laying down taking a nap.' and the baby shark said (in the sweetest, high voice)'Okay, are we going to cool (school) today?' and daddy shark said 'Yes, we are all going to cool.' and then they went to cool all day long."  I told him what a wonderful story that was and thanks for telling it to me. He was so proud of his accomplishment. In hindsight now, I think this sounds somewhat like "Finding Nemo" although he hasn't watched it in a while. Ya just never know...  Oh! Last night as I was reading him his bedtime stories, we were reading Dr. Seuss' ABC Book (Ya know, Big A, Little A, what begins with A?), anyway at the very very last page on the back cover of the book it has the entire alphabet with upper and lowercases kind of in order but not in straight lines, so Quaide wanted me to ask him to point out letters. So I did the ones I knew I had tought him, as stated in an earlier post: A,D,E,I,M,O,Q,U,and X and then he said "Which one other ones?" So I
