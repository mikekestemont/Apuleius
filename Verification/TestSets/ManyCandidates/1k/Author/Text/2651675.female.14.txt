take pictures of me but leave me to despare. to light you, you are you for a reason never leave me here. love me here, see me here, just leave me in this dark hole and never take me out. your my 9th page by far my best, please stay like nothing has happend and love like you have never hurt me and live like you still love me. dont leave me now you know how i feel remember forever. dont leave
oh walls of pink and orange leave me to write, to live, to love. and blinds let the light shine in just enough to see my pen dance in the reflections of you, your beautiful light could make anyone dance and sing. i love your silly antics of nothing and your thoughts of everything your like light, your neccesary to me you are a need, you are my life, you are a rant, you are a love, you make my pen dance in your beautiful light never leave me. oh light you are me.
you ask me to love you, ask me to forgive you, ask me to forget, forget the lies of our existance. you ask me to live with out you in my world, and i cant do it. you stand there like a huge void in the doorway. or maybe thats what i want you to be. just a huge void in my life. please, pleaes leave this world to me and close your eyes and leave me to write.
writings in the dark, no glare, no light, so much life.  the only light is the alarm clock, and the street light that creeps through the blinds with such a brilliance it is like an unending light that is dark and has so much feeling. the green light of the alarm clock glares off my pen to make reflections on you, you piece of paper i can write to you and noone can care. i can see the outline of the hulk on my sheets and thats it. this soft music helps me to write to you, i can barley stay awake anymore to see the faces of this life drown into certain places of myth and leave us. please leave this place now and make room for the good ones leave us in peace, in health, in love.
the lightening flases into my room through the blinds with such a flash it glares into my eyes like a little kid going through a light house. could it be that these are the random flashbacks of longing for certain people? this life is great who could leave it i love this world i love this life.
another day as the world passes by me i lean into you  in my dark hot and unwelcoming room  i lay in my bed and write my heart to you, you little piece of paper  your my only salvation.
im high on E as the room spins around me  giving me no hope for the future  and leaveing me cold and disparing  lying on the kitchen floor  waiting for my life to end  and a new world to begin.
his poetic soul withers away  like he he is gone  he is lost lost forever in this endless world the world that rejects him the world that hates him the supposidly understanding world we turned on him he is so small he carrys this tremendous hate on this shoulders always and forever until he cuts it loose cuts his life away from the pain and ends his damned life. he has a new life now a better one he isnt tormented  he is loved yet,he was always loved he just couldnt tell.
as i listen to the torments of his life  as i hear his goodbyes as the sun fades into the clouds as i see him running from the pain he hides it under his pillow his pillow is a place for his secrets  he lays apon them everynight and keeps the pain close to his heart  his love is male and so is he he feels the rejection of family and piers and crys he crys rivers onto the tears that any of us cry he is sadden by the thought of he he is him and thats all he needs to see           i dont think i like that poem does oit even make since?
a stack of blank cd's to burn your memories on a mirror on the wall to look at yourself and remember a printer on a desk to write the letter a bottle of water in the fridge to qunch your thirst a box of kleenex to dry the tears a tablet of tylenol to cure the pain a sip a gin to give you a little buzz a blanket to warm your cold feet a loved one to sit beside you a picture for them to rember you by a heart for the pain to churn a bed for the rest of your life.
As the world revolves around me like one of those fall leaves cought in a wind cyclone taking off at a moments notice.I realize i am not alone in this world. There are many things around me that i never notice.Maybe its just the slight bit of cough syrup i just took or my mind has opened up to new and wonderful thoughts and feelings. All these things just make you think how small you are. I mean can we belive there is no other life around us? can we! do we have the oudasity to say that we are the only living things in this universe?You know we are like the tip of a needle in this whole entire universe just the tip.WERE NOTHING!. were one planet, in one solar system out of 100's, in one gallexy out of millions,all in one universe. We are so small. How can we even start to judge a thing like this, is it even possible? is it?  it might jUSt mystify me, but god, doesnt it just seem outrageously real?maybe a l
