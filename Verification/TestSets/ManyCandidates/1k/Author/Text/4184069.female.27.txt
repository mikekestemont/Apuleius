I've journaled extensively for some time. I've written about people I hate, people who get on my nerves, how much sex I'd like to be having, crazy dreams I've had, etc etc. This is one of the literary forms that I enjoy partaking in the most. Journaling, or "blogging" as it's now known, can be liberating. You can say all of the crazy shit on paper, that you couldn't say to whomever it was you may've been conversing or arguing with or even shagging (or gank banking as my best friend and I lovingly refer to it as).  As Tony Soprano said this past season to his psychiatrist, Dr. Melfi, sometimes spilling open is like taking a massive shit. You feel a sense of relief. You've gotten rid of a load, albeit the load is personal. You feel triumphant. Holding bac- (bowels or thoughts) - is like Tantalus Torture... it can be very uncomfortable, the more the pressure builds. Unloading one's thoughts is an intimate act as is deficating. You sit on the can, and you ponder, as you're unloading. What a great analogy! It's usually something you do by yourself. Journaling allows you to expend that feeling.... the anger, the lust, the happiness, the joy etc etc. You can fucking trash people without having to deal with the drama you'd be bothered with, if you were to curse someone to their face. I suppose what I'm trying ot say is that my mind works in stereo folks! I am the quintessial shit talker and most of the time it's justified. I'm direct and I'm honest, but I'm also guarded and leery. There are times I simply can't say what I'd like to say to people. I simply write it down and store it away. I think now that I am ready to make the web masses privy what goes on in my head. All of it is worthwhile and thought provoking. Some of it might be a little profane and perverse. My mind run 'round and 'round liek a colorful mobius strip... none of the geometrical shapes ever really making any sense, but it's good shit nevertheless!  Of course I will compose your basic run-of-the-mill thoughts about current events and popular culture.  Important thoughts such as why Paris Hilton's sensuous vapidness is so appealing and noteworthy opinions of the like.  Fasten your seatbelts. This voyage inside my head may be turbulent, but it will be funnier than hell!
Today plans to be a very unproductive one here at work... I hope. In the meantime, what to do, what to do-o... Hey! I know! I'll blog!  Let me blog about how unpredictable and strange the male populace can be. Not all of them... but some of them. Enough to make me scratch my head in befuddlement.  Some dudes are guilty of the same codes of conduct they accuse some of us women of e.g., complaining, talking incessantly and whining incessantly. Guys within my age bracket (26-mid 30's) can make you feel like you're the only person in the world when you're with them. They whisper sweet nothings in your ear and confess their feelings right on the spot. Sometimes this might even occur on the first or second date. Meanwhile, you're sitting there the whole time think,    "Ohmydog! Is he serious?? We don't even know each other this is moving waay to fast..."     Of course you don't voice your concerns aloud, you simply just sit there nodding and smiling politely, wondering if it was a bad idea to make out with this clown. They mistake your smile for mutual feelings, however, and shortly thereafter... all of a sudden, this is when the guy decides to pull the rug out from under you.  He  beats  you  to the punch and end abruptly puts an end to things ,  after a handful of trysts. He accuses  you  of developing "big feelings" notwithstanding the fact that he pursued you and is the one with the big feelings. He is the one who talked up all of this rhetorical bullshit about seeing alot of each other, while you sat across from him with a grimace/smile combo on your face, trying not to wretch over the prospect of seeing this annoying so-and-so on a consistent basis. I think some guys like to flatter themselves. They build themselves up and think some of us women are supposed to idolize them. We should be flattered that they've asked us out and treated us to a couple of drinks and some take-out. There is nothing wrong with a little ego-boost fellas, but give me a fuckin' break! Dudes are always shocked as shit when some of us girls don't go sniveling and crying for an explanation. They're speechless after having given this long-winded speech about how fast this is going, because you simply listen quietly, nod, and then say,    "Okay. Well good luck with your endeavors."     They stumble around    "wha', huh... uhhh... oh okay..."    stunned by your indifference and your willingness to accept that this brief courtship has fizzled. I can't even begin to explain how many self-absorbed dickweeds my best friend and I have dealt with, who think they're the shit and we're completely and utterly in love with them after like 3 dates. They become insecure because they've laid all of their cards on the table only to not have the feelings reciprocated. They make up some fucking bullshit explanation making US look like the clingy ones. Contrary to popular MAN-belief, we are really relieved that it's over. We simply do not give a fucking shit, because you were annoying to begin with. Not all women are pathetic dames looking to settle. If all you wanted to do was screw or make-out, then cut the pretense, shut the fuck up, and let shit unfold naturally. This bullshit is precisely why I prefer to date an older gent. The conversation is a lot more interesting and flows consistently, he is more direct with what he wants and needs, we can agree or disagree and then we proceed to  a
