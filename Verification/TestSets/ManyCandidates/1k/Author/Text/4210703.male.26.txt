I don't know how they do it.  Writers are notorious for being drinkers.  To me, there's nothing more difficult than writing while drunk or hungover.  I'm experiencing the latter right about now.  I'm feeling like a machine that's out of order, and I'll be writing about the latest dysfunction in my life.  Weird.  My friends have had to endure listening to my endless bitching about how hard it's been for me to meet guys for the past eight months.  Yesterday I met up with a guy, and it was a disaster, much like every experience with guys this year.  He was sweet, very cute, and I enjoyed listening to him talk.  The problem was that I couldn't be fully engaged in the conversation.  I just didn't know what to say.  I was totally zoning out, and my mind drifted to random crap that had nothing to do with our conversation.  All I wanted to do was lay down and rest.  I wish it were perfectly normal to just say to someone, "Hey, I know we just met, and I know I'm the one who suggested hanging out, but is there anyway we could save conversation for later and just lay down and stare at the clouds?"   Therein lies the problem I guess.  I'm too stressed out and focused right now to be dating.  Plus I'm continuously working through issues I've had with my ex-boyfriend.  But the process of working on my goals and working through past-relationship shit has never felt lonelier nor more difficult.  I suppose once I get through it  all I'll be a stronger person, but when you're thick in the middle of the process, the end seems nowhere in sight.    When I'm having a hard time practicing for the LSAT, I wonder, Gee, if I had someone to care about and vice versa, maybe I'd be having an easier time focusing instead of feeling like this ghost of a person.  It bothers me that I've assigned the most meaning to my life in terms of how well I do on a stupid fucking test .  I have a lot around people around me that I'm grateful for, and little by little I'm recognizing things about myself that make me appreciate life and give me meaning, but for some reason, I feel it necesssary to share it all with someone.  Sometimes I think what I have is too much for me to handle alone.  I've been stuck on thinking what the next sentence should be for quite some time and tie things together because right now, everything is rather disjointed.  The only thought that occurred to me to let words keep flowing is that maybe, just maybe, I'm so worried about the possibility of failing that if it does occur, I'll feel so broken and low that I won't be able to depend on myself to cope with it.  I'd have my friends, but it's not the same as having someone you love there by your side.  God, I wonder if people who grew up in healthy families exeperience this kind of bullshiit.  All of this sounds like trite, cliched crap.  But you know, it's the kind of stuff that helps uncrowd my mind.    I think I can study now...
When I was in the Creative Writing program at SFSU, I had to do a ton of writing exercises each week.  It got the point where I felt like I was out of ideas completely.  Or in other instances, I'd stare at my computer screen, and whatever ideas I'd have in my head earlier in the day no longer seemed fresh and interesting when I tried to flesh them out.    That's how I feel now.  I've been trying to think of something good to say in my next post, but feared it would only come off as, "whoa is me, my life is a bitch."  I'd have damn good reason to think that though.  I might explain that in a bit.    But this thought was particularly striking to me today.  I was pretty desperate to clasp on to a dramatic idea/fantasy in my head to literally force upon myself a fresh perspective of life.  It sort of worked.  While fighting off a very strong wave of post-lunch food coma at work, I got it in my head to finally call my doctor about my x-ray results.  Earlier in the week I went to the doctor because I've been getting short of breath and have been having trouble breathing in general.  For someone at 26 years-old, that's pretty unusual.  So I got it checked out.    The receptionist who answered my call kind of weirded me out.  After she looked up my information, her warm disposition shifted to clinical efficiency when she asked,  "what number do you prefer to be reached at for a private message?"  I held my already shallow breath out of surprise.  What was this about, I thought.  I gave her my number slowly, hoping she'd detect the concern she raised in me, and then she abruptly told me the doctor will get back to me and hung up.   When I put the phone down, I thought, God, what if this is something serious?  I wasn't prepared for this.  And then a sick idea popped in my head: So what?  So what if it serious?  I got to thinking that if my days were numbered, maybe I'd start appreciating life a bit more.  And I was!  I was sitting in my cubicle thinking about how short life is, and in my case, how it may be even shorter.  The papers around me, the keyboard I was touching, the office walls and other cubicles all looked beautiful to me.  Every thing I felt bad about in my life seemed so trivial.    I don't know how the suddenly appreciative perspective wore off, but it did, and it disappeared rather instantly.  It was like I walked through a fog and into light, and when I turned back to look at the fog, it wasn't there anymore.  I could see everything as b
