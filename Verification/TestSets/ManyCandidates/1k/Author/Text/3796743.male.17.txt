Cool pic huh? I found that one online. That is pretty much how I feel right now. I have no plans for today, basically watching tv and tanning outside....sounds like a blast. So if y'all wanna call me GO FOR IT !!!   I'll leave you with this quote I found:  "We are all just flying around this world in a small plane and there's no room for extra baggage."  Till Later
Hey team...I've decided to start this whole little blog thing up again. Hopefully it will be a little different than before. I'll probably include politics and my beliefs which I find myself becoming more interested in by the day. So, if you don't enjoy my thoughts or beliefs than you should probably not read on...but I would hope that you would and not hate because I happen to have different beliefs than you. That has been my BIGGEST problem for about...oh i dunno...a year or more. The people I choose to surround myself with are mainly of a different background and have different beliefs. I am TOTALLY FINE with that. But these people are not. They think they can convert me and argue with me on a daily basis about how wrong my beliefs are. This is why I like this whole blog thing. I can spew my thoughts on topics without people telling me how wrong I am until after they read my entire arguement. So I encourage you...read the entire blog. You don't have to like it or think I am right (think I'm an ass for all I care) but I ask you to do one thing. RESPECT my opinions and beliefs as I respect yours. Don't call me names, or tell me I'm wrong without an arguement to back it up. Some may even find that I know more than I pretend to.  So to begin this blog...here's what I did today. NOTHING! Actually I got up early (10.30) and did nothing but eat. I met Alex downtown to hang out in some social establishments (namely the library and others...). Then as we were walking back (I had one of those bottled frappuccinos) I drank too much and it came out my nose. It was gross, I've never had anything come out my nose before...so that was super cool. heh. Then I came home and tanned for about an hour and a half and to my suprise I was still white when I got done....I'm getting sick of tanning and not getting tan...it may be time to go tanning California style. I love my life. (but I'll meddle on that in another blog...)  So here we go...hopefully I will find myself updating this blog daily this summer...I hope you all have a good night...  Later
So today was okay...I basically spent it doing errands and just catching up on some stuff. But my day didn't start off too well. I woke up at 9:30 AM!!! The damn FedEx man thought it would be funny to show up at my house, ring the door bell twice! and then knock a ton!!! I was pissed. He wouldn't even just leave the package, he needed the stupid signature. I'm not amused...at all! So me, looking like crap, answers the dumb door gives the guy his damn signature...and then I go back to bed.  After waking up at a more normal time, I tryed to fix my sister's computer again! I had to put a whole new frickin hard drive in it. What a pain in my behind. This stupid computer has been acting up for like the past month. I finally fixed it, after like 5 hours of my labor...I'm not a very happy camper, but its done, fixed, better...finally! I did some other crap and finished packing my suitcase to go to San Francisco. It's full totally full, but its cool. I'm so excited to go tomorrow...Emily's dad is picking me up at like 1 o'clock-ish...we are going to have so much fun! I cannot wait. So no more blogs until next Tuesday, August 3rd...when I will fill you all in about my super fun trip to San Fran.....See ya all in a week!   Good Night Everybody!
So...I've decided to share with you my super successful outlook on life. You see, hey why is John so damn happy all the time? I don't know either. It's just like that. But lately this is how I've been looking at all the crap that happens in my life...look at life like its a war. It's quite simple. You've got to drop the bombs in the right place at the right time.  I'm thinking of shaking stuff up. Maybe cut off some dead weight. I do that every once in a while. I haven't done it since freshman year. I decide which of my friends I want to continue to be my friends. I got rid of quite a few freshman year, and I couldn't be happier with the results. I really think that it works. Look at every one of your relationships, and decide which of them are going in the direction that you think is right, and which ones contribute positively to your life. Then, you cut off all the rest. It sounds mean, but it really makes ya happier. Maybe, I'll start thinking about this again. Yep....thats cool huh?  In other news, today I did pretty much nothing. What a life huh? I woke up at like eleven, went to IHOP for breakfast/brunch and then did errands which suck, but whatever. Spent like $300 at the grocery store, cause I had no food here! But I bought a ton of Ben & Jerry's Brownie Batter! Best ever!   But on TV, there was footage of the Ronald Reagan funeral, and I got sad all of a sudden. That sucks. Oh well, now I'm watching Cops. That show is a white trash showcase. Hmmm....well one of the things I hate doing is packing. I hate it almost as much as I hate un-packing. But I gotta get ready for San Francisco....one more d
