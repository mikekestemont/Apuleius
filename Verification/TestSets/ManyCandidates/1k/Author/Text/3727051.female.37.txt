Despite their propensity for cleanliness, pigs, Ilya decided, were just plain nasty.  It never failed that her turn for cleaning the pens came during the hottest parts of the summer.  The sodden muck of the pens stuck to her boots, the pigs, greatful for company, rubbed against her legs which were usually clad in a pair of one of her older brother's cast-off breeches (her mother hated seeing her in boy's clothing, but had given up trying to prevent it), and the flies buzzed and bit unmercifully through the damp tangle of hair at her neck and ears.      Summer in __________ was usually a very pleasant time.  The fields ripened and turned green and golden under a bright azure sky.  Children played in the fields, swam in the streams and ponds, and climbed trees in the forest.  Wives tended kitchen gardens, looked after the little ones, and chatted across hedgerows.  Husbands tilled fields, looked after animals, mended equipment, and stopped for a mug of frothy cool ale at The Hen and Jackal.
You know, the concept which most occupies my mind in the last few weeks has been beheading.  Gruesome thing to be thinking about.  Ever since Nick Berg's death, I have been fascinated with the concept of how individuals can do this to other human beings. The thought boggles my mind.  How do you take a screaming, kicking, pleading person, someone with a family, friends, hopes, and dreams, and saw his head off?  How do you sleep?  How do you eat?  How do you go home to your family?  I watched the Nick Berg video and some of the other videos available on the net that document cases of torture (stoning, even impaling someone on a stake), and my mind can't grasp the brutality and lack of humanity involved in such an act.  Even more distressing are the number of people who turn out to cheer on such events.  Now we have 2 more executed men - Paul Johnson, and Kim Sung-Ill, a Korean.  The families who are left to wait in agony, knowing the outcome of their loved ones' fate, knowing there will be pictures and videos released of the horrendous last moments of life, how do they cope?  How do you exist?  Whom do you blame?  There will be no trials for the families to attend, there will be no executions to watch, there will be no closure.  There will only be a casket which can't be opened.  I believe that the war in Iraq is a good thing, if any war can be said to be good.  I support our President and our troops.  I know that sometimes the greater good can be lost in the shuffle of the everyday.  Relieving Iraq of Saddam  was  a good thing; giving Iraq a democratic sytstem of government  is  a good thing.  There are a great many who disagree.  They will be proven wrong.
Breaking one's foot sucks, to put it mildly.&nbsp; Friday's surgery was to repair the tendon (that was what I heard break), and to attempt to fix the bone.&nbsp; Apparently, the bone was shattered to such an extent that it wouldn't hold a screw, therefore, my foot is full of some kind of wire mesh designed to hold the bone in place.  &nbsp; I had my first shower since Thursday today,&nbsp; boy did it feel good, but I am stuck in bed with my foot propped up.&nbsp; Hubby and boy child are being terrific about it, and they are really helping me out. &nbsp; I will, unfortunately, miss Monday's&nbsp; interviews for a new principal.&nbsp; And that pisses me off to no end.&nbsp; I don't dare try to go, though. &nbsp;  sigh &nbsp; hard to get comfortable at the computer, hard to get comfortable in bed, hard to get comfortable period. &nbsp; Oh well, life goes on...
As if this summer hasn't been nightmarish enough, last night I stepped off the sidewalk in front of the deck and broke a couple metatarsals in my left foot!  There's nothing quite like the sound of bone breaking as you fall to the recently mown grass in the dark of night - all because you had to go and get your cat (who has 3 legs by the way).  It only gets better.  Hubby is plopped in front of the TV finishing up dinner (we ate late 9:30 pm), and I'm writhing around on the ground trying to call out to him - he thinks I'm hollering for the cat.  Anyway, I finally manage to lift myself off the ground enough to wave frantically at him.  Out he comes, and off we go, 30 miles, to the emergency room.  Unfortunately, two mini-vans full of adults and kids collided east of town - the small hospital was a bit overwhelmed; some of the kids had to be life-flighted, and some of the adults had to be taken to other area hospitals.  Rightly so, my foot was not a priority, and we were told that it would be 4:30 or 5:00 am before the x-ray machines would be free and a doctor would be free.  So off we go, 30 miles back home (the nurse did wrap my foot and tell me to keep ice on it as they really couldn't do anything while it was still swollen).  Once home, hubby makes me comfortable on the couch (as comfortable as a tummy sleeper can be on her back), I doze off and on fitfully through the night, and once morning comes, off we go again to the ER.  The upshot of all this is, I have to see an orthopedist tomorrow to get my foot set and get a cast (maybe).  Meanwhile, I am trundling around with a little blue shoe-thingy and some crutches.  My first broken bone in my entire life has to be something as ignominious as a metatarsal, SHEESH!!!
Hmm...the plot thickens around here.  Our esteemed leader, the "Ice Queen," as I call her has sent out letters to those of us on a certain committee stating the times of the interviews for t
