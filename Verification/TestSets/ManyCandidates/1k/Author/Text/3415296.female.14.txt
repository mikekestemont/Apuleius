I just finished writing a post and I'm writing another one. I feel so weird. I guess I just wanted to share everything. Before I go crazy. I just want to say, Nima you don't have to feel sorry. I would've done the same thing if I were you. Any friend would do that. Anyways I'm greatful that your my friend =), well best friend. I'm going to ignore the past and live on 'til my life ends. I remember all those times I would go to my basement, hold my cordless phone, and just cry. I really don't know why. I miss all those times when I would talk to him on the phone. I would always want to call. Like today, he didn't come to school, and what I usualy did was call him at school to see if he was alright. Now, I don't think I could do that. I can't do that. I still care about him. He just doesn't back. That's alright though. I just wish I was sure of one thing. If he really did love me. That's all I wish to know..
Okay I'm breathing in and out, and hopefully I'll get this right. I, Alice Lim, will talk to Safee about everything I ever wanted to say to him tomorrow. Even if it rains, I will not care because this is more important than getting wet by some rain. I will be strong. I will do what I say, even though I never do, I will. And for once I won't feel ashamed about what I am saying because what I will be saying is the truth, and I can't deny it. I just wish I had the confidence I needed.   Today I put everything that he gave me in this box. Even the stars I made, I still didn't finish making it all. I just thought that it can help me for a while. I was planning to hand it over to Nima, just for safekeeping, but then, I really wanted finish making those stars, really I did. I think I only have 100 left to go. But that's still 100. I remember yesturday I wrote [ 95 - 1053 ] on my name. 95 days, meant something. It was the number of days me and Safee was together. The numberof days where we were more than friends. 1053, the number of days I've known him since the beginning to the last day of grade 8. Some people say I should still give it to him, the stars I mean. I guess that's for what I feel about in the end.   I was talking to Nima on the phone and he said he was worried because he thought Joey sound upset over the phone. I didn't know what was happening, so I couldn't say I knew what he was going through. I just told him that whatever she's upset or thinking about, their love is going to conquer it all. I know that line seems tacky, but it's the truth. Their love is so true, and even someone like me can figure that out. They can work it out together, I know they can. Because they're both strong. I was then talking to Joey on MSN and she said that there were some doubts between them. I said that everyone had their doubts during a relationship, but it doesn't stop you from loving the person. I knew that they would fix this one thing immediately, it's just common sense. Love is common sense. Something that you just know. It doesn't take much thinking to know.   That's what I wanted to know from someone, but I never asked. I was too afraid, but now I'm not. I'm not that little girl who would be afraid of every little thing. I'm stronger now, from the person I was yesturday. Thanks to everyone and the experiences I went with them.
Now, I am sure of it. I called Safee that we should go out to the park, just one last talk. Since he said he wanted to on MSN the other day, but I had to go. I was sure today was the day where I was going to say that we shouldn't get back together, and why I was acting the way I was when we were going out. I wanted to tell him everything like I did on my blog. But I couldn't. We said we'd meet at three, at lilac grove, or as he calls it the "strawberry" park. I really have no clue why he calls it that. I left early, and was at the spot where we were first together. The pond. I felt so relaxed, like nothing could go wrong. But already a lot of things did go wrong. I talked to myself, saying what I should say to him.    I don't really care what we are anymore Safee, either if we're enemies, or friends, I just don't want you to lie to me. I don't want to have a relationship with any person, either if it's friends or more, I want honesty. I want a lot of things. That's why I'm sorry. I expected too much out of you. And I'm sorry for it. I'm sorry for everything that happened. I'm sorry I couldnt hold on to you...   After I thought that, I cried. I wiped them before Safee saw me. I walked over to the park and he wasnt there, I wanted to walk back to the pond. Then I had a feeling he came, and I looked back and saw him coming towards me. I walked to him. We talked. Walked over to the pond, that place where we shared something special. We were throwing rocks, having a competition of course. And he won, obviously. I'm getting weak. We actually just talked about stupid things, as usual. At the end, he said, "I don't think we should be together." I said yea, we shouldnt if we like other people. "We" didn't refer to me. I didn't have a
