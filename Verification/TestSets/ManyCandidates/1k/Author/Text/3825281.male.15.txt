Finally! Kelly's video for Breakaway is finally here. Fantastic.  Fan-frickin-tastic.  Go download it now. No, seriously. Now. Don't read this. Download it.  If you're still here, I guess I'll post a message.  So my sister is here. As usual, I can't wait to see Maddy and Tyler, then they get kinda annoying. I know it's so bad to say, but when they are with you all day asking for ten thousand things and wanting to climb all over you and have you play with them, it's tiring and annoying.  I watched that show 'Amish in the City' last night. Not bad. I'll probably keep watching because I'm a sucker for reality tv shows. But after the Amish people got there, you couldn't tell the difference between the city kids and the amish kids. C'MON. The Amish kids had highlights in their hair, really tan bodies, high heeled shoes.. The Amish people that live around here sure don't have those.  I guess I didn't do 'Closing Out The Week' last week, did I? I guess I can do it right now.   People  5. Kelly Clarkson 4. Kelly Clarkson 3. Kelly Clarkson 2. Kelly Clarkson 1.

Well, as I write this I'm spending the night at Ian and Drew's... It's fun :P But I'm tired. Oh well.   I didn't have to go to Cross Country today! Because of my feet.... They hurt so bad.   I really don't know why I even decided to post this.. But Drew, Ben, and Jason are playing video games. Boring.   Anyway.. my sister is going to be here tomorrow. So this next week will be hectic. Why? Two words. Maddy and Tyler. That's three words isn't it? Cut me some slack :P It's 11:08. That's 8 minutes past when I normally go to bed.   Oh, and just a random shoutout to Veronica. The only person who reads and comments without me forcing them. haha
Well, I need to leave in a minute for Cross Country, but I'll post anyway..   Not much to say, but I needed to post. 'She Will Be Loved' by Maroon 5 is one of the best songs I've ever heard :P I'm sure that will change by next week, but that's just how my life goes. Obsessed with something one week and over it the next. Well, that's how everything goes except Harry Potter. And Kelly Clarkson. I'm rambling? Yes.   On the topic of Cross Country (were we on that topic?), it get's worse and worse each day. They are working like we are in the middle of the actual season. It's summer practice. I don't see why that is so important! We are going to be burned out by the start of the season. Oh well. Not my fault! And I know they will be complaining like there's no tomorrow when the season rolls around and everyone is hurting.  I can't wait to go to Cedar Point! We are going August.. something. I'm too lazy to click that little calendar button on my computer. But I can't wait! Top Thrill Dragster, Millenium Force, Raptor, Magnum, Demon Drop, Power Tower... mmm... But we'll probably not go because everything I look forward to never happens!   My sister is coming home Saturday! This will probably be one of the last times we see her for a long time, because she is going to Seattle. (I'm sure I've said that somewhere in the old posts..) I want to go to Seattle, but I want them to be closer! Maddy and Tyler are awesome!   The Amazing Race... tsk tsk. Bob and Marsha got eliminated. How stupid. They rocked. Lance and Marshall or whatever the fat jewish brother's names are, need to be gone.  Now.  They bug me like it's no one's business. Oh well. At least Charla and Mirna are in second place. And Bob and Joyce are in 3rd! (I think..) Linda and Karen didn't do so hot this week, but they are still in! They are hillarious.   Speaking of hillarious, anyone watch I Love The 90's on VH1? Loni Love cracks me UP. Especially when they were talking about beanie babies, and she was like 'People put them in their cubicles at work, and smush them together, and scream 'IT'S MY NEW BEANIEEEEE!'' I was dying.   I guess I did have a lot to say? Oh well. I must go finish getting ready to go to Cross Country. I hate it. I'll say it again - I hate it.
Ok, I decided to do this 'Closing Out The Week' thing. Basically, I'll just say my top 5 favorite of whatever I feel like at the moment. (Movies, Books, People, Songs, TV..)  This week, I'll do.. people and songs!   Songs  5. Meant To Live - Switchfoot 4. Scandalous - Mis-Teeq 3. Accidently In Love - Couting Crows 2. Wrong - Kimberley Locke 1. Breakaway - Kelly Clarkson   People  5. Mirna (From the Amazing Race) 4. Charla (From the Amazing Race) 3. Rachael Ray 2. Kelly Clarkson 1. Diana DeGarmo  There's the lists folks. Comment away. I need opinions.  Sorry I haven't posted for a few days.. My computer is having major issues. It's so stupid.  Charla and Mirna are in 2nd place at the moment on the Amazing Race! How awesome is that? I'm glad Charla is showing everyone that midgets can do anything anyone else can. And beating Alison was awesome, because Alison yelled 'MIDGET' into her face. Haha Alison. Have fun coming back to this sucky town and leading a miserable life. I hate her, if you couldn't tell.  Went to the local 'amusement' park last night. If you can call a park with about 5 rides (all of which twirl) an amusement park.. I hate it there. I want to go to Cedar Point. And if my brother is coming home on the weekend we were going to go, there's going to be problems. I must ride the Top Thrill Dragster.  Random thought - I love Cotton Candy.  I don't really have anything e
