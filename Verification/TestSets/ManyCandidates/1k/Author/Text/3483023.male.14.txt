Hey World, I Am Bored Outta My Mind! Everthing Is Closed Today, No Mail, No New Shows Or Anything! I Am Thinking About Going Swimming Today, But I'm Sure That The Pool Is Closed As Well,LOL....Everything Is Closed! I Am Excited Though Because In 13 Minutes 'MTV'S Beach House: Summer On The Run' Kix Off And I'm Sure That Will Be Great! Ok... That Is All For Today, Off To Be Bored!
Hey Everyone,  Welcome To My Blog, I Am Just Testing Things Out At The Moment, I Will Be Adding A Actual Post Soon..... This Seems To Be Kinda Kewl
Hey, I'm Bored Outta My Mind! I Love The New Newlyweed Commercials With The Old People Acting Like Nick & Jessica. I Also Like The New Show On MTV Called 'Your Face Or Mine'... Not Really Any Point To The Show, But It Does Take Up Time. I Don't Think I Am Doing Anything For The Rest Of The Week Either, I Will Eventually Get Around To Reading My 'Kansas State Driving Book' Thing, But The Book Is So Long And Has So Little Letters, LOL, Its Boring And Stupid! All You Need To Know To Drive Is Green Means Go, Red Means Stop, Yellow Means You'd Better Hurry Your Ass Off Or You Have To Stop And The One Thing You ALWAYS Need TO Remember If Your In A Accident You Always Say ' I DIDN'T DO IT ' And You Never Ever Ever Admit To Doing It! I Am Off To Go Do Something Interesting... Change Out The Laundry, LOL... C YA'll Next Time!
I Finally Got My Lap Top Today, Yeah! I Am Having Fun And Putting It Through Hell Seeing If It Will Break Down And Cry!
Hello World, Today Was Nascar Racin, Yeah! Harvick Finished 10th W/ A Little 'Accident' Along The Way... Long Story! Tomorrow I Should Be Getting My Lap Top, Go UPS & Dell It Is Coming About 3-4 Days Earlier Then Expected! I Am Probably Going To Bed Early Tonight, Who Knows When The UPS Guy Will Be Here, I Would Go Crazy If I Was Asleep When He/She Got Here! See Ya Laterz World!
Hello World! My Dad Is Finally Back At Work And Outta Vacation Days, Yeah! I Tell You Over The Past Week I Have Spent At Least 12 Hours On The Road, Boring! I Am Also So Tired It Isn't Funny, I Could Probably Sleep Right Now, But Sleeping Is Boring & A Waste Of Time. My Lap Top Should Be Here Monday, Yeah! I Missed Reagan's Funeral Live, But I Caught It Last Night On CNN, It Was Sad. I Hope The World Is Doing Good, I Am Going To Take A Nap Later, C YA!
I'm Back & Better Then Ever, Ok.. I'm Tired, But I'm Still Better Then Ever! I Should Stay Home For Awhile, But I Am Eventually Going Back To Crescent To Spend TIme With Some Other People. I Am So Tired It Isn't Funny, I Could Proably Lay My Head On The Desk And Go To Sleep, But Sleeping Is Just A Waste Of Time!
Short Entry Today... I Got My Report Card & I Am Extremely Busy, See Ya World!
Today I Did Absolutely Nothing, And Still Didn't Get My Report Card! I Don't Know If I Will Have Time To Post A Entry Tomorrow, Because I Am Going To The Rodeo, I Get To Check Out cowgirls...Go Me! I Am Going To The Rodeo With My Cousins Then I Am I Think Staying With Them Until Monday And Then I'm Coming Home. I Swear If I Don't Get My Report Card Tomorrow... I'm Not Getting It  Ever ! I Am Really Happy I Get To Do Something, If You Can't Tell From My Entry's I Have Been Doing A lot Of Nothing For This Past Week!
Hello World, I Did Just About Nothing All Day Long! I Am Still Waiting On My Report Card Which I Have Decided Is Not Coming! I Was Informed From My Dad What We Are Doing For The Next Few Weeks, Boring! I Guess This Saturday I Get To Go The A Rodeo, I Am Not Excited About That Really, But I Am Excited About Seeing My Cousins. I Haven't Seen Them In Over A Month, Kinda Miss Them! Ok.... I Am Anxious On Getting My Report Card Because If I Get Straight A's I Get A Lap Top (aka Notebook), So That Is Why I Am Massivly Over Concerned About My Report Card, I'm Not Crazy..... I Promise! I Am Almost Positive I Will Get Straight A's But Like Any One Else Would Be.... I Am Nervous! I Am  Almost  Positive It Will Come In The Mail Tomorrow, But With My Luck, It Won't....Always Can Hope!
Hello World, Finally We Went And Got Grocerys Today, Food Yeah! Amazing, We Go And Get Grocerys And For Dinner We Have Sandwiches, Yumm!
Hey Everyone, I Am Finally Starting To Feel Like I'm On Summer Vacation! Finally MTV & The Local Radio Stations Have Started The Summer Music & Shows! I Really Don't Have Any Plans For The Summer I Have Some Stuff I Would Like To Do Like: Visit Friends And Family, Swim, Go To A Ammusment/Water Park, Watch MTV, Listen To 107.3, PARTY, Play On Hopefully My New Lap Top, And Must Of All Just Have FUN! I Really Don't Have Any Plans Set In Stone As You Can See, Beside To Have A Blast!
We Didn't Really Do Much Today Either, Just Kinda Set Around. After Everyone Got Home We Went And Rented 'Ron White: They Call Me Tater Salad' & 'The Big Bounce'. I Really Liked 'They Call Me Tater Salad' It Was Halirous And I Would Recommend It For Mature Audiences To See, But None Of The 'Young Ones. As Far As 'The Big Bounce'... They Could Have Made The Movie Last 10 Minutes Long, But They Stretched It Out Into A Good 1Hr &amp; A Half. The Movie 'The Big Bouce' Is Basically A Movie Where Everyone Screws Everyone Ever....Stupid!
Today We D
