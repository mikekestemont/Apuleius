I am just the empty, hollow shell of a man now.  I didn't know I could be this empty.  Every bit of sustenance has been emptied out of me...but that is too much detail.  Word of caution to everyone, never, I repeat, never put yourself in a position in which you have to take Fleet's Phosphorus; and if you ever do find yourself in that position, promise me you won't put yourself through the agony of the Ginger-Lemon flavored Fleet's Phosphorous.  It just isn't worth it.  But the worst part of this whole thing is that I really...really...really miss food.  The one thing I really want more than life giving oxygen right now is a large, Bazil's chicken parm sub, fresh from the oven...oh, now I've started drooling again.  Do you know how hard it is to watch eleven kids from 8:45 AM to 3:00 PM when you haven't had anything at all to eat...at all? Nothing but clear liquids and Jell-O.  Don't get me wrong...I could eat Jell-O and drink water all day if it wasn't for the fact that everywhere you turn, good, hot, appetizing food is being eaten.  I thought I would watch some TV to take my mind off the hole in my stomach, but did that help...NO!  It made it worse.  All I could think about today was Wendy's...Well, not officially (if you don't get this, get your nose out of that book and watch more TV!) because that stupid commercial is on every stinking break!  I'm going to cut this entry short today because I need to get up early tomorrow for the endoscopy and colonoscopy at Children's and I really don't think you want me to go into detail with what the medication is doing to my bowels.  So...leave me in peace!  Out
Well, today was the first day of Camp Patoma, Junior Program, where I am the proud councilor for the eleven campers int he Green Group.  I have many of the same kids I had last year, but I also have a bunch of new meat...I mean kids.  Most of them are pretty good, well behaved, and listen to me.  But then there are those little brats who like to tick me off for the fun of it.  Usually I can deal with them, but the problem is that they seem to have a way of getting everyone else to start talking at the same time, too.  As you can see, the situation can quickly drop into chaos.  I'm so glad I got a CIT though to help me keep them under control.  He's a pretty good CIT too, but he tries a little to hard during games, which is a problem when you are dealing with little kids. They just can't jump as high or run as fast as someone like, say for instance...a CIT!Ah, oh well, you can only do so much.  One of the many highlights of today was Arts & Crafts, where the craft today was making Styrofoam gliders.  Well, not really making them really, more like coloring them in and then spending the rest of the time trying to figure out how to make the stupid things fly, or bother the councilor about how to get the stupid thing to fly...who is also trying to get the stupid thing to fly and not doing very well at it.  In the end though, I did figure out how to get it to fly and I'm pretty good at it too, if I do say myself, I I do.  But I think I was a little to good.  When I got home later on, I was flying the thing outside (because it is the coolest  thing ever!) and it was making a really good run too...right onto the roof.  You should have seen my face, the shear joy of watching the glider fly turn into pure horror as the glider banks and heads straight for the roof of my living room.  I cried like a baby who has just had his pasiflier run over by a car...or something like that.  Well, not even like that because I didn't really cry, but you know I was crying on the inside.  But the worst part was I didn't get any sympathy from my family.  Now, I know this is sounding like I'm whining...and I probably am...but if you had only seen it, you would have cried too.  On other highlight, then I'm done.  I would like to take this moment to brag about my superior archery skills.  I shot a bull's eye on my third shot today.  Yes, that's right, a bull's eye.  Lets see how many of you can do that.  Just as  a told my kids before, that's the last time your going to see that from me for the rest of the year.  Complete and utter luck.  Thank you for sharing that wonderful bragging moment with me, it makes me feel so special.  One more thing before I go.  Word of advice to all: Don't get up at 6:00 AM to go running...it just isn't worth it during the summer.  That's it for tonight...so go away...and no, you can't take the glider as a souvenir.  Out
Sorry, for those of you who were dying to know how the work situation turned out (and I know there are a lot of out there), I finally resolved the conflict.  When I went into Brooks today for the fourth time in three days to check the schedule or talk with a manager...which ever comes first...and I noticed that my name was crossed out for this Wednesday, finally!  You can all breath again.  Out
I would like to start off by saying that I was having a really bad day yesterday and if I happened to insult anyone, this is a general apology for everyone.  With that out of the way, lets continue...  Boy, do I hate mowing the grass.  After today, one would think that the entire lawn was covered in dog crap.  I think the mower must have ran over it about...a m
