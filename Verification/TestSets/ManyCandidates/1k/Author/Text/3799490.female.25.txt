Just right quick... I changed the name of my site.  The games and fun will still be the same.  I just felt like I crippled myself in my ability to write by letting certain people know the address.  All names will still be changed to protect the guilty, the stories may get a bit more outrageous, and there may even be more drama to come!  So let the games begin.  Thanks!
Just a quick bit here... I'm flipping thru the newest issue of People Magazine (which I hardly ever read, but it caught me at the check out) and I see this picture...  It's a photo of David Bowie. He's wearing a green tshirt, sporting what appears to be a handlebar mustache, & cowboy hat. I've also noticed that A) He has little man boobs and B) He has T.H.O's (must I type it?)  Behind him, is a man of obvious Oriental descent, who by the way, looks like this Korean guy I lived with in college.  His name was Bianco, he ate  Kimchee ALL the time, which meant our house always smelled like rotting trash & farts. (*mental note to self: Write blog on those horrid few months)  The uncanny thing about this photo, is at first glance, I thought it was Mr. Detroit himself Ted Nugent. How in the WORLD could I have mistaken Ziggy Stardust for Ted Nugent? Whoa. I guess when you become an old , burnout, crusty rockstar, it's all the same.
I just returned from a trip into town (which is a whole 4  miles up the road). On my way to the grocery, I decided I'd pull into one of the many subdivisions along the way and try to find one of my  girl's new digs.  She recently bought a house a mile up the road.  Unfortunately for me, it was 10p.m , there were no street lights, and this neighborhood only has one entrance.  I felt like I was in a trap.   After driving around endlessly looking for one red Honda( since I didn't catch her address or street), I gave up my plight & started searching for the entrance/exit to this Labrynth.  When I could not find my way out, I didn't panic, I started craving a smoke.  Luckily for me, I started diggin in my purse.  In my dark car, in a dark neighborhood, which is under construction with no street lights.   (Do you see where this is leading yet?) I pull onto a street, which I think will lead me to the way out.  I instead, cut my wheel to quick, hop a curb and drive over this guys front yard.  Nice right?  It gets better.  There are, to my advantage, 8 police cars 2 doors up.  There are also 4 cops standing around, doing nothing I'd imagine,  and they all witness me do a horrible injustice to a new home owner by driving on his newly planted Bermuda grass.  Cue in sirens, lights and whistles OH MY!  I pulled over anyway. First, because I figured they thought I was drunk.  (I'm not) Secondly, I had been driving aimlessly in this damn neighborhood for about 20 minutes trying to get out.  I was hopeful my local authorities could escort me to the main gate. Third, I needed a piece of gum.  Alas! Let's not forget I live in a small town. This means that I'm walking away scott free.   As the officer approaches my car, I think to myself "Eh, should I say: No sir, ossifer, I hadn't drank a drink all day! Hic" but I realized that was none too smart. He did approach, and as he got closer, I recognized him from the local gas station. Whew! He said: Trixie! What in God's name are you doin' drivin' round here like a maniac?! Yew been a drinkin'? "Aww, hell man.  Yew know I ain't a big drinker.  Plus, I used my last bit of 'Shine to fuel my car!" Hahahaha. I explained to him the err of my ways and why I ran over that guys grass.  How I was still diggin' for a piece of gum and still wanting to smoke. He offered me a stick of gum and the directions to get the hell out of the neighborhood. (Stop sign T/L. Next sign T/R. Go 1/2 mile, entrance straight ahead!)  Whew. For a moment there I thought I was going to turn into David Bowie.
Right now all I want is a giant Almond Joy milkshake from Brewster's Ice Cream. I want one so bad I can taste it.  I mean I REALLY want one & bad! Instead of eating crap to surpress my craving, I will probably do about 75 sit ups , some push ups &amp; jump up and down on my bed.  ( hey, it's better than jumping up and down on the floor!)  It's 815pm, I'm just getting home from Valucinda's house.  I went over there after work and fell asleep. Sigh. That's ok, RD is still @ my Pop's house working in his shop.  He should be home shortly and then we'll be taking off to Nashville for a little R&R.  Hopefully.  If he doesn't fall asleep first...  Since I slept 2 hrs after work I'm sure I'll be blogging yall to death around 12-1am today.  :) Get ready! OH! And I've been 5 days without a smoke! Can I getta Hell yes?!  Well, I'm going to go get ready for a night of being fancy free with my man. Tomorrow I am going up to the jail with my step mom to visit my brother.  I'll have to get up fairly early (so maybe I shouldn't spend all night rambling?)  Till then! I leave you still craving that Almond Joy milkshake... mmmm.... milkshake.... yuuummmmmy.
Ok, I have a question to throw out there.  Maybe I'm being left out of the loop, maybe I was raised differently, or maybe I'm a bit morbid.  My husbands Granny is pretty ill. She's only going to be around for a few more weeks.  Granted, I do think a
