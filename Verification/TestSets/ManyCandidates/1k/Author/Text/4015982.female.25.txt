so it was raining a little before we left to go to the show..but when we left things had cleared up.. the 15 minute walk was okay, and the first 5 or 10 minutes of the show were fine.. then it started drizzling..  and then the ceilings opened up and it poured and poured for the rest of the show..  funny enough, before we left, my blow dryer broke before i was finished drying my hair, and i was kinda upset that i was going out with wet hair..  15 minutes into the show, we were soaked to the bone.  soaked.  you have no idea.  i should have taken a picture.  but, aside from the rain, which wasn't even that bad, since it wasn't all that cold out, the show was FREAKIN' AMAZING!!  i heart the trews, what can i say. they are in kingston this week, and if i can find anyone to come to the show, i'll go.  but before the show, there was drama (surprise surprise).. i feel bad.  jen and scott and trish were here. and then ana and mike and ana came, and then jeff and darin..  i wasn't sure if it would be a good idea to have scott around when jeff got here, but i thought that maybe it would finally drill through to jeff, that she is back with scott and only wants to be friends with jeff..  well me and trish went downstairs to meet jeff and darin, cause we were going to out to grab some food.. and trish told jeff that scott was upstairs in my apartment..  jeff lost it..  and said he wasn't going upstairs with scott there.. so i thought fine enough..  he's really uncomfortable so we'll all hang out and meet up with jen and scott at the concert.. so we left to go get food, but first we went to the beer store. after jeff came out of the beer store he decided that he was going back to oakville.  he's really really pissed. i mean, i understand that he's really hurt, and i feel bad..  but they weren't even dating really.  anyway, so that sucked.  so by the time jeff had decided that he was going back to suburban-hell, jen and scott had already left. so i called them, told them to come back, and we'd have a couple of drinks and head to the show.. so we met them back at my place, then brad and tony (mmm tony - he's sexy) came over and we all left.  then trish and jen and scott and brad and tony pussied out because of the rain, so me ana and mike met up with my friend tera after the show, and came back here to drink a few more beer.  ana got drunk and annoying, like she always does, tera  left, mike fell asleep, and now i'm in my room chillin' before i go to bed.. anyway, tis all.  me oh so tired..  i'm going to my ma's for the next week tomorrow, so unless we get some high-speed access going over there, i won't be writing for awhile.  dial-up effing sucks. i hope jeff is okay. peace out.
so yesterday was my birthay (yay for me)!  i got to work, did some work, then myself, nick, katie and jen fucked off and went to grand bend..  when we left it was hot and sunny and a perfect day to go to the beach. and we're driving, and its getting kinda gray, and we're driving..  and a cold breeze kicks in.  by the time we got to the beach it was quite overcast and not so warm anymore..  i wasn't planning on going in the water, but then katie and nick had the brilliant idea to bury me in the sand (i wish i'd had a picture) so i had to go in to get all the sand off of me.  it was fah-reezing!!  so cold.  like i said earlier, the trews are playing tonight..  (yay for the trews)!! they go on at 10pm, but there is a band i wanted to see that goes on at 9.. so ana and mike and jeff and darin are coming from home to the show..  ana finished work at 3:15 and was going to leave with mike as soon as she got home, and jeff was going to pick up darin at 5:30 and come straight here. i just talked to ana, and her and mike aren't leaving until 5pm.. i'm really irritated with that. i don't know why though.. we were all going to go out for dinner, but i'm not waiting for them, cause i want to start boozin'.. so me and jen and maybe trish? are going down to barakats for some yummy chicken shawarma's.. mmm i'm taking next week off work. i need a break. nothing is working and its really frustrating.. i'm hoping that having some time off, and then starting fresh will be good for me.    so i'm going to go back to my ma's with ana and mike tomorrow morning.  anyway, tis all for now.  i must finish cleaning etc.. jen is on her way over.
i was supposed to go meet a friend for drinks tonight, and i was laying on my couch watching the news waiting for her to call, and i fell asleep.&nbsp; this was 6ish, cause the news was on.&nbsp; then all of a sudden i woke up and it was 11pm.&nbsp; damn.&nbsp; that's a long nap.&nbsp; so as soon as i woke up i took a sleeping pill. hopefully it will work tonight. so jeff and jen talked tonight.&nbsp; from jeff's point of view, everything went well, and then i talked to jenn.&nbsp; she had a different story.&nbsp; he was pretty mad, he even asked her not to come friday.&nbsp; eff that.&nbsp; i told her to come.&nbsp; its not even like they had anything together... they hung out once by themselves.&nbsp; once. and haven't even been talking on the phone at all for the last month.&nbsp; so j
