Ok so this is all pretty stupid.  They didn't take my braces off.  Instead they put in a spring so I can barely open my mouth.  Eatting is a pain in the ass.  This research paper is almost over and done with.  I'm glad, but I've reached the point where I don't care anymore.  I can't take it anymore.  I don't meet all the requirements and I couldn't give a rats ass.  He's gonna have to accept what I have.  I just want to get out of here.  I need a vacation.  June 25th... I get my braces off, finally!!  Oh then I might not be able to take my drive test because I'll be leaving for Chicago.  I already got tickets and there was no way in hell I was gonna set the date back even farther!  It's bad enough my summers been cut back by almost a week.  It's not fair I tell you.  My life is shit and I'm getting sick of it.  I just wanna sleep and never wake up. later dayz

Ok so we're supposed to do this research paper for my American Lit. class (my subject is Elvis) and it's got me so stressed out it's unbelievable.  And the fact that my depression is still lingering isn't helping.  Cuz with depression comes procrastination ten-fold.  So I'm sitting here thinking about how I should be working on it, but too "lazy" to.  And knowing that I'm going to completely screw this thing up and probably get shit from my teacher is making me sick.  Literally.  I feel queasy.  I wouldn't be surprised if I got sick.  So I've been trying to do things to get my mind off it when I should be working on it!  ARG...  Anyway, I have an orthodontist appointment tomorrow.  I hope they take my braces off.  They could at least take my top ones off!  There's nothing more they can do besides close up those two spaces they made, which can easily be fixed by a retainer, or one of those clear things that go around your teeth.  *sigh*  They will be off before summer, or both Mom and Phil are going to have some nasty things to say to those people.  Hell, even Phil is getting pissed and annoyed.  bah!  I'm off to procrastinate some more, I plan to work on it tomorrow.  Seriously, I will.  You just watch. later dayz
Well that fucking sucked.  I went to take my drive test yesterday but the two DOLs I could have possibly gone to were booked until July.  So fuck getting my license before I go to Dad's.  I plan on cheating the system.  Go to Dad's, tell them I just moved there, and never had a chance to take my drive test, and get an Illinois license.  I plan on living there after my senior year anyway.  The only bad thing about having an Illinois license is that I can't be on Mom's insurance because I have to have a Washington license, but I really don't care.  Rachel can drive me, heh.  At my ortho. appointment the nurse that was working on my totally fucked up, so I was there for over an hour when I should have only been there for 45 minutes.  The only good thing outta that whole damn day was the fact I got my hair dyed black.  Yup.  Jet black too.  I was told in the sun it has a little bit of a blue tint to it.  I've yet to see it, Phil says he has.  blah... Kevin just called and it's after 8.... fucker.  Lucky Nate wasn't sleeping or he'd have gotten beat by my family.  Ok I leave for Dad's on Tuesday!!  Oh yeah!!  Can't wait!  Gonna be kidnapped by Nicky and Sherri!!  I wanna go to GO.... We'll have to talk Nicky.  ok I'm done later dayz
Nicky demanded I make an update, so I am.  Took my two biggest finals today.  Holy crap am I nervous.  I seriously don't want to fail those classes, and I didn't do to well on either final.  I know for sure I failed my Spanish final... I had an A- let's see what happens.  Tomorrow is my last day of school, then I'll be a senior!!  I'm so excited (and I just can't hide it).  Then I might get to take my driving test on Friday if I'm lucky and there isn't a lot of people there.  wOOt!!  Mom comes back from her business trip in Florida late tonight.  She had fun.  Went down a water slide, all is good.  It had been in the 80s here for like the past week and then today it got crappy...  AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!  Summer vacation is almost here. weeeee!!!!  And I need some major money.  meh, that's about it that's going on with me though.  So there Nicky, have a crappy update.  Nothing goes on in my life so it's hard.  ok no more babbling. later dayz

Kevin came outta no where today during third period.  He was with the Life Skills students collecting the recycles.  He wouldn't tell me why he was with 'em though.  However, before he left, he gave me a kiss.  It was kinda unexpected but not really.  I had been getting the feeling he was going to do something like that soon.  But I had just seen him like fifteen minutes ago, so why didn't he do it then when he was busy doing something?  That boy can be random sometimes.  Anyway, my weekend was a relaxing one for once.  It was nice.  Sam and I both agree that I'm an empath too.  She wants to help me w
