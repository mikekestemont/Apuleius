I saw a Kerry/Edwards one a week ago. I pointed it out to my mom and we're both like... "Is that guy asking for a death sentence?!"  Kind of sad, really. Democrats don't even have to vote in Texas because it's no use, anyway. Stupid electoral college.

nobody knows, actually. i made it just today =) &nbsp;so what are we supposed to post, anyhow?
I am now part of a blog TEAM!  I feel the power.  Who all knows about this blog, Yini?  Meh.  I need to go scratch my back.  Later, dear comrades.
blah
...so, I will procrastinate. What on earth possessed me to take AP History for no GPA?!?!?!?!?!??!!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
I just love school.  I just love ecc.  Of course.  And homework.         A days are okay for me.  2 easy classes, 2 hard classes.  Lunch with Yini at 11.  Whooo!
English is hell. Humanities is the same. French is hell.  Nuff said.
now's the time to get them.  they're 6.99 each.  and so are the scarves.  sooo puuuurtty.  I went there wanting to get a shirt like the lacy black/white ones I keep wearing (cuz I like them and wearing these two all the time is a bit... gross), but they were ALL SOLD OUT.  And last time we went (saturday) there was an entire RACKFUL.  I was soooo freakishly mad.  And they were cheap, too!  either 3.97...?  (perhaps that's why they were sold out.)  but!  instead my mother got me strange "crop" pants (the kind that aren't long enough to be pants but not short enough to be capris..  annoying is the word for them... they just kinda hang at your ankles) that were on sale (of course).  but they were black and they are comfy, so yeah.  then I chose to get a skirt (of course) because I luuuuuuuurve them (who hasn't noticed yet?) and they're kinda sorta freaky but not to such an extent that they're urgly.  I lurve it.  But I can't wear it until summer (which starts in march here).  but I luuuuuurve it.  so maybe I'll wear it tomorrow anyways!  XDD  (see, I go ga-ga over skirts.)  anyhooooooo...  kai, you forgot to log out from neopets.  XDD  I'm gonna rs for you.  you should thaaaank me.  man, how do you LIVE with only 65 items stocked at one time?!  maaaaaan.  anyhow.  I'm going to go wear my skirt b/c I luuuuuuurve it!  (are you tired of me gushing over the skirt now?)  anyhow.  finished coloring the piccy, kai!!  it looks ubercool.  I erased the outlines for the hands and arms, so it's ALL determined by color.  it's aaaaaawesome.  lyke, uh, totally TUBULAR!  XDD  riiiiiiiiight.  ++sunny
kai and meng are coming over!  yay!  with my photoshop disc that I did NOT lose!  double wahooooooEE!  XDD  Yesterday night / early this morning I drew a whole bunch of pics while listening to why can't I on repeat 1.  gosh, don't know what I would do without repeat 1.  anyhoo.  can't find my frogger disc now.  crappy!  ++sunny
to start off... a little quizzy:   Elvish    urlLink   To which race of Middle Earth do you belong?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    =)  looking at the code for that ^ I can actually understand it!!!  I'm so proud of myself.  I seem to have misplaced my photoshop disc....  by any chance is it at one of your houses?   MENG DON'T BLEEP THIS PART =>  :: I want to make my OWN backgrounds and userlookups and blogs... The premade ones either have stupid citations messing them up or they have words where I don't think there should be words, etc.  And I'm getting sick of my solid-color backgrounds.  I think I can get enough tutorials to help me make them.  =)  you guys wanna help?  come over tomorrow and we'll wrestle the stupid technological world.  It'll be so much fun! ::   I'm all restock banned on neopets... but I did buy another Babyca!  for 380k, too.  =)  see, kai, you should learn from me.  (not just fair deals... GOOD deals.)  So now I'm freaking poor ("freaking poor") at 150k.   yay, kai, we're poor together!!  anyhooooo...  dreamland is not turning out to be a v. good read.  get-throughable, but not outstanding.  ++sunny
gah!  I had to come home.  crappy crappy!  tian tian (1010) might not be in lux4 next semester!!!  nooooooooooo!!  anyhow.  I MUST FIND OUT AFTER WE GO BACK TO SCHOOL.  MUST.  KNOW.  XDD  anyhow.  I feel like making layouts.  but I don't know hooooow.  I must drag everyone over someday and figure out how to make layouts.  for neopets of course.  XP  then I can make ones that I like and I don't have to keep stealing other ppls.  but then I'd hafta figure out the code, w
