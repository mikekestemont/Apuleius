urlLink      I'm Rachel Green from Friends!   urlLink Take the Friends Quiz here.   created by  urlLink     urlLink stomps  .       I'm Rachel? I guess I am similar to Rachel in some ways. We both like to shop..haha..but I'm not obessed with it though. I was suprise I wasn't Phoebe..because I'm ditzy like her sometimes..haha. But yeah..I love "Friends"..I'm so sad it's only re-runs now..*sigh*.
Today has been a pretty depressing day :(. Like Monday night, I didn't get a lot of sleep last night. To make manners worse, I woke up around 7:30 this morning&nbsp;because my jerky brother just had to pick a fight with my sister...grr. I went to work today..I was supposed to work from 12-7:45 but I went home at 3..because we didn't get a lot of business today in good old concession. I took a nap again today, and had some terrible dreams that I don't want to share with anyone. Plus, I miss my mom!! My mom always goes on business trips for work. She's been in Chicago since Monday..and won't be back till' Friday. I've been used to my mom traveling a lot since I was little..but I miss her!! There's another why I'm sad..but I don't want to share what is it on here..just pray that I feel happy really soon. I will on this weekend when my mom is home and I go to Kennywood :). So yeah..I would write more..but again I'm not in the best mood..sorry.
I hate rain. Why do I have live through snowy winters, and rainy summers!! I can't wait to get out of this stupid state...I don't care if I have family and friends here...this place is booooorrrrrrrrrinnnnnnnggggg!! Anyways today been an alright day. I didn't get a lot of sleep last night though...I&nbsp;had a lot on my mind..and I can't never sleep when I have a dilema or when my brain has the juices going at a fast pace. I woke up around 7:30 this morning because my stupid cat is in heat and was moaning outside my door. So I gave up and got up and drank my daily dose of good ol' O.J. This afternoon I visited my grandma, watched my usual soap operas, and then made up for lost sleep last night by taking a nap. I really have no big plans this week until Sunday when I'm going to Kennywood with Day and hopefully Ashley C. I just pray that it doesn't rain tommorrow because I don't how much more I can take of this crappy weather! It's making me depressed..especially since my skin is shade of Dracula. Whatever...I'm going to stop whining and make the best of it...sigh...
I would be watching the Red Sox vs. Yankees game right now..but now I am mad at my Boston Red Sox..for they're already losing in the 1st inning! I am a fan that is not happy right now! So anyways..my day was pretty boring. I went to church..and then I went to work. Work was so slllllloooooow today. Nobody was there for most of the time. I mainly cleaned and talked to&nbsp;Chris, Drew, and Ashley&nbsp;whenever they were on there break. After work mom and Rachael let me drive them home from Meadville (I still have so many hours to go!). Then I watch a little of I love of the 80s Strike Back. I am such a loser for liking shows on Vh1 that talk about pop culture from the past few decades. I didn't live in the 70s..I was born in the late 80s..and so the only decade I can mostly remember is the 90s. Anyways...I'm really bored right now..and I don't want to watch the game..because I'm mad at the Red Sox! So I'll sit here awhile and check on the game later. Later...:)
This is my second post today..even though it seems like my first..(Last post was around 12:15 last night..so it still considered today instead). But I wanted to post some lyrics of this&nbsp;awesome song that's starting to get some air play. I first heard about Ryan Cabera from watching "The Ashlee Simpson Show" (I'm truly sick of reality shows..and Ashlee is a bigger brat than Jessica!)..and anyways..Ashlee is dating Ryan. A few nights later I heard "On the Way Down" and fell in love with the song as well as it's lyrics.   Sick and tired of this world  There's no more air  Tripping over myself, going nowhere  Waiting, suffocating, no direction  I took a dive and  [CHORUS]  On the way down  I saw you, and you saved me from myself  And I won't forget the way you loved me  And on the way down  I almost fell right through  But I held on to you  Been wondering why it's only me  Have you always been inside waiting to breathe  It's alright, sunlight on my face  I wake up and yet, I'm alive 'cause  [CHORUS]  I was so afraid of going under  But now, the weight of the world  Feels like nothing, nothing  (down, down, down)  You're all I wanted  (down, down, down)  You're all I needed  (down, down, down)  You're all I wanted  You're all I needed  And I won't forget the way you loved me  All that I wanted, all that I needed and now  [CHORUS]
Everything was going pretty good today..until' a few hours ago..(keep reading)..Anyways I went to my grandma's today..and then I went to work. Work was boring and nothing exciting happen. After work..I headed over to MCT..to see "At This Evening's Performance"..and it was awesome! I highly recommend it..Dan did a awesome job w/ directing..as well as Stephanie and Grant acting. So go see it..the 7 dollars is worth it! After the play I went home w/ Mike..and his dad drove. By time we reached East Mead..a stupid deer ran out to the road and hit the driver's side of the van. Nobody is hurt..but the car took some damage..and after all that the stupid&nbsp; deer ran away. I feel really shaky right now..because about year ago..Rachael and I almost hit a dog..and well we hit a tree. That's m
