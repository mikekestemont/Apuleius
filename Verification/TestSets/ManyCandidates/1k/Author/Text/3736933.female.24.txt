We have taken it alot easier today. We turned up at rehearsals last night only to find that nothing was ready yet. Us Koori's we have our 'Korri Time' well the Greeks here they have Greek time, ie the Olympics arenas not finished yet with like two weeks til the games atcually start. So anyway, Emma and Allan didn't get to have their sound check last night, we waited for ages, but the Greeks were working on their own time, things were supposed to be ready at 5:30pm and when 7:30pm came around and nothing was finished ie the stage, lighting, sound, we all decided to go back to the hotel and have dinner.   Our cab ride back from the museum was something we would not forget. The taxi driver was playing dumb, and trying to take us around the whole world, acting like he never knew where he was going, anyway, we came up to a street and he couldn't get through, there was police and army people everywhere. The taxi driver ordered us out, and said that their was a demonstration on and that we had to walk now. We barely knew where we were, and then all of a sudden we hear these loud screams and chanting going on. We started walking up the street, there was so many police everywhere, Emma was freaking out, we held each others hands, as we watched hundreds of people match the street, angry their voices. We didn't understand a word what was going on, and we were too scared to ask anyone. Today at our hotel we found out the march was a protest to the US embassy in regards to the war in Iraq.   The night ended quietly, I had sore feet by the time we got back to the hotel, it was again another early night.  Today we decided to take it easy. We had a quiet breakfast, and I watched Al iron all my clothes, pretty impressive he works good, ha ha, I train him good, jokes. And after that we headed down to the markets again for some more shopping. Wait til you see all the jewellery Al bought me. We walked around and then met up with the rest of the crew for lunch with Jennifer Bott who works for the Australia Arts Council. Lunch was great, we went to a great restaurant near the Plaka.   This afternoon Al and Emma are just practicing at the hotel,  the exhibition starts at 8:30pm. I am just about to go and ready, dressing up for the night. Jennifer told us that channel nine and channel seven are here from Australia, and that Cathie Freeman is sending a video message, and their is going to be lots of Australian Press, so I have to be looking the goods for the media, ha ha.   We are off on a cruise tomorrow to visit the islands of Agena, Poros and Hydra, they are fairly close to Athens, we would have loved to travel to Myconos, or Santorini, but time won't allow us, I think it is 6 hours ferry to Myconos. I am just excited to head to the beach and have a swim.
It is around 3:20pm on Tuesday afternoon. I am feeling extremely drained, we have had the biggest day. But I will start off with last night. Emma, Allan and the crew finally arrived at 7:30pm last night. They looked completely stuffed, and Emma's bag was lost, she got it back this morning (bloody QANTAS) ha ha. Anyway I waited for them to shower and we headed down town to find some dinner. We stopped off at a busy little taverna in one of the narrow streets not far from our hotel. The food was absolutley devine. I had the house speciality which consisted of lamb souvalaki, and garlic sauce on pita bread with salsa type stuff on top. I don't know the greek name but it was so yummy. Al and Emma had mixed Giros, and we all left the table holding our bellies. As they were all so tired, we retreated back to our rooms for an early night.  I was up as usual at 6am. Breakfast at the hotel, and then we headed for the markets. We passed lots of flash shops, but we looked mostly at the flea markets for little gifts. We walked all the way to the Ancient Agora. The road was really dusty, and bumpy with lots of rocks etc. We wandered along the paths to the top of the mountain to the Acropolis. We saw the Theatre of Dionysos, temple of Olympian Zeus and the Odeum of Herodes. The view from the top was magnificent. As this is my second trip to Athens I was surprised how the scenary still was able to captivate me. Allan was enjoying himself, camera happy taking pictures everywhere. Once I get back I will post some on this site (I still have to invest in a digital). Al missed a perfect photo opportunity as I fell over on the steps walking down from the Acropolis, nothing hurt though, just embarassment as it happened in front of plenty of tourists, ha ha.   After a few hours of touring around the lankmarks, we headed back to the city for some lunch. We ate at a great little cafe outside the gates of the Agora City. I love Mousakka, and I stuffed myself on this. We did a bit more shopping on the way back to the hotel.   Allan and Emma are getting their stuff ready as they have rehersals at 5:30pm over at the Benaki Contempory Museum where they will perform tomorrow night. It is getting exciting.
I arrived in Athens at 6:30am this morning, Greece time, but I think it was around 1:30pm Sydney time. The trip felt like it was never going to end, I guess it felt even longer as I was and still am by myself. Allan and the band are arriving tonight, their flight gets in at 5:30pm. I really feel for t
