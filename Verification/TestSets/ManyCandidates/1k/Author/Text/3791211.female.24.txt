So last weekend I went to my second Pride Parade in Toronto.  Much fun was had with only a few minor disagreeable moments.  I left Kingston early Friday morning with my friend Dan and stayed in a really great hostel along Church St.  We even had a friendly hello from a girl staying in our room the first night and who proceeded to have sex with her girlfriend while I waited for Dan to get out of the washroom (there's only so much rustling I can do!).    Anyway, the first night Dan and I checked out a Carribean band playing at the South stage and sat down to watch the crowds, that is, until a crazy fat man with no shirt decided to sit beside me and sing at the top of his lungs . . . it was time to go.  Saturday was the Dyke March which was great, but why is it always the women who shouldn't be taking their shirts off who love to so much?  Another of life's mysteries.  I did sit next to a really cute lesbian couple with a three-year-old girl who was adorable.  She kept walking out in the middle of the street to see when the March was coming, later she threw some of her mom's money in the street, very funny.    Later Dan and I met up with Amy and Alex who were joining some other girls at the women's beer garden which was very tempting but I wouldn't abandon my faggy friends!  They really need some more inclusive events.  When James met up with us the overpriced drinking began and a little later his friend Duncan joined us and more drinking was had.  That night after two more of James friends had joined us, all of us walked over to the drag stage where there were some really great drag queens doing Cher, Chicago, and various other numbers.  As a little aside, Drag Queen's are just sooooo great, they make everything more fun, end of story.  There was also a really great Hedwig and the Angry Inch band playing but we had to choose and the drag show won out.    This brings us to Sunday, if ever there was a gay holy day this is it, a million people crammed themselves into a few blocks to watch half naked, all out naked, drag queens, and various other crazy costumed people parade down Yonge St. to dance music.  Props to the gay bagpipe band and the huge peacock dress which took three guys to pull it!  Hopefully I can find someone with a scanner and put a few pictures on here someday.  The parade was about two and half hours long and we had to line up outside the guardrails an hour earlier to secure a spot to see, so people started complaining their legs were sore and decided to walk the rest of the parade and sit down somewhere.  Dan decided he didn't want to and he'd meet me later at the drag stage again, but unfortunately due to one of our party wanting to check out some very lame merchandise we were late and I couldn't find him.  This wouldn't have worried me so if he hadn't had the key to the locker where my bag was, but it turned out alright in the end when we met up at the hostel.    I arrived home at 3:00am and found my cat's food and water dish were empty and her litter packed to the hilt.  I don't know if the person taking care of her forgot but she was not a happy kitty.  After filling her dishes and some snuggling all was forgiven :)    So that's about it, but I'll leave you with a quick commentary.  The Pride Parade does seem to have lost its meaningfulness as an anniversary for the Stonewall Riots and become very very over corporatized.  That's not to say I think it shouldn't happen, we shouldn't be naive in thinking the majority still wouldn't like to pretend queer people don't exist and that reaffirmation of our community isn't important, but multiple times this weekend people asked why this event was even needed and at one point I was told the queer community doesn't even have a history to celebrate!  This is very sad and shows a terrible lack of education among queer youth, Pride week should be one time of the year that the community does take the time to educate them and give them a better hold of queer culture than just a big party. People need more than that if they're going to develop a true sense of pride to celebrate.

I wish I could say this is due to some love of writing but, alas, it is born out of my laziness at writing e-mails to my friends.  I'll still attempt to write individually to all of you, but at least this way those of you I don't see often can keep up with my daily travails (because I know my life interests you so, as it should!).  I would say daily adventures but c'mon let's be honest, my life is hardly an adventure - unless you count all those car chases, explosions, and . . . oh yeah that's a movie I saw not my life, so travails it is then.
Today has been incredibly boring. I'm talking watching paint dry kinda boring, but it's actually a good thing because it'll finally motivate me to get a move on with the whole job situation. I thought the boredom would set in much earlier than this, like June 1st, but luckily (unluckily?) it's just been a kick ass summer. Nothing much has happened since James left. Dan and I went over the Queer Social Scene constitution for AMS ratification and then proceeded to play three hours of UNO with Naila at the Goat. Tonight I'll be hanging out with Dan once again for our regularly scheduled games night (I do believe t
