Ok so here is my post, again..I am a little new to this Blog thing but I am getting the hang of it....(Thanks Erin) Hey All! I think that I am the first person to respond to this weeks question. To all of you that might not know my, this is Ticia. I am an alumni from '98.' I couldn't make the weekend this year due to some personal matters (i know Matt my coolness factor has decreased) however I plan on being super involved from now on to make next years weekend rock as much and more than this years. I think that there are two possible ways to answer this question. This first thing to realize is do you mean the students that just completed the weekend, or do you mean involving more students to actually participate in next years weekend. If what you mean is to keep the students that just attened the weekend involved, the key is a well run and organized Alumni Program. This I can attest to from experience. I loved the alumni program when I completed my weekend, I used to commute 45 mins just to attend an alumni meeting. The alumni program I feel is the key to keeping the newbies involved. If what you are talking about is getting more students to participate in the actuall weekend I think that comes down to education and to publicitiy. I believe the education aspect of it is another way to keep the recent attendees involved as well. We should think about recruiting them to speak to the sophomores next year about what MASSStar is and maybe why they should want to get involved. Educating the schools even more than I am sure we have about MASSStar as well. I am sorry this is so long and these are just some basic ideas that I am sure can be developed into some great programs, with everybody's input and creativity. I look forward to working closely with all of you.
Hey everyone, sorry I didn't respond to the first one, but here goes:       One way to make MassSTAR more recognizable is to talk about MassSTAR whenever and wherever you can.  We need to let more people know about how amazing this experience is... for everyone, not just us.  I love MassSTAR.  This year's conference was such a new and different experience for me.  I had never been a part of a group that had truly cared so much for one another.  All of the returning staffers made us New Kids feel right at home, from the minute we stepped into our hall.  That was so nice.  A part of making MassSTAR better is to show that warmth and kindness to anyone who is interested in MassSTAR.  Show them just how amazing you guys truly are.  If they see how great this is, they are definitely going to want to join in the fun!  Thanks guys! You all made waves and waves of difference in my life.
Ok guys -- here's the next question!   Look for a new one every week or so... and you can always add responses to older questions as we move forward.  "How can we get more students involved in MassSTAR in 2005 and in the future?"
sorry it has taken me so long to post this up here!    i have to say my best memory was the dj incident. it was funny, cool, and touching all in one.  it ended in celebration and riding the pony - that's the funny. melissa's conversation was also hilarious (not only was she talking faster than emily ann ever talks, but she was pacing and jumping around and telling the person that every sophomore in MA was there). it was cool cuz we all really got to work together very closely on one thing.  most of the weekend was spent with ops doing their thing and then the facilitators and sp's being separated with their clusters.  this brought us all together cuz we had ops and helpers running around like crazy.  we kept in close contact with the facilitators and sp's who tried to stall the delegates a bit in order to give ops a bit more time to set up and find a dj (thanks melissa kaye for selflessness and ability to ask anything necessary to anyone for the benefit of MassSTAR).  and it was touching in a not-quite-so-sentimental-way.  it touched me, though.  nobody hesitated. we all just kind of jumped into things and everyone filled in a different role until everyone was doing something and everything possible was being done.    i would just like to add that cheers online are always a good thing. just let kayla know how my PMA was. i encourage you all to try it:)
So I get thoughts/quotes of the day posted on one of my home screens.  This one came up today:    Life is an opportunity, benefit from it. Life is a beauty, admire it. Life is a dream, realize it. Life is a challenge, meet it. Life is a duty, complete it. Life is a game, play it. Life is a promise, fulfill it. Life is sorrow, overcome it. Life is a song, sing it. Life is a struggle, accept it. Life is a tragedy, confront it. Life is an adventure, dare it. Life is luck, make it. Life is life, fight for it! - Mother Teresa  I think that massSTAR is truly life! Thanks again EVERYONE!  Oh, and I have pictures - I ordered the cd with it, so if anyone wants pictures emailed, let me know (I have a picture from ALMOST every cluster I think).   Kristen  OK - More to add.  I just sent an email to my delegates to see how their week has gone, this is what I got back from a delegates mom - I took out her name.  Hi Kristen, This is ** Mom, Deb responding. I must say what a great weekend it was and my daughter didn't stop talking about the ice cream cone exercise, rental negotiations, egg drop fumble and h
