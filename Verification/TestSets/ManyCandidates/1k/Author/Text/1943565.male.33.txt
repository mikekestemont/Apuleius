I am now emotionally scarred.     THOSE OF YOU WHO ATTEND THE AS-YET-UNDISCLOSED-BY-NAME-YET-TERRIBLY-EVIDENT-BY-INNUENDO COLLEGE THAT I WORK FOR ...do NOT eat the Cool Ranch Doritos (TM) in the Kava House.   They have no flavor.   Two people -- plus me -- have all opened separate bags, and have been psychologically damaged by the absence of Cool Ranchy goodness.  These are, simply, naked and flavorless corn chips.  Sweet Canadian Mullets...what the heck will happen next?!?
Sleep.  I remember this theory.  It was a good one, at one time.  As it stands now, I think I'm getting it in three hour (or less) increments.  I don't think it's scientifically possible at this point for me to sleep more than three hours and four minutes at a stretch.  This is, logically, followed by me getting insomnia for a good half an hour before I conk out again.  Rest is for the weak.  I acknowledge it not.  -- and no, it's not due to unnatural caffeine ingestion.  I didn't drink any coffee products last night.    Part of the problem (I believe) comes from the fact I'm   not   taking my medication right now.  Now, before I am burned in effigy, it's because I was asked to see if I can keep from doing so before I take yet another return trip to the Friendly Neighborhood Neurologist, and they run another shiny, happy series of tests on me to see  what in the name of Xanadu  is wrong with my head.  So, Sonny has unnatural pain in his noggin (including, but not limited to, a scalp that is so tender that it hurts to wash my hair) and this makes the resting on the pillow to be an accomplishment in and of itself.  Feh.
It's been one of THOSE Mondays;   I'm   not my biggest fan right now.  I'm just taking the attitude the rest of the free world has adopted -- apparently, I got "666" tattooed on my forehead last night or something...so, come on!  The game is called  Pile on Sonny !  I shall now go and seek therapy through caffeine.  Of  course , my bloody espresso machine WOULD choose this weekend to completely, utterly, and unfixably break (as in, knobs --  PLURAL!!  -- fall off at random).  Now I must buy another before I am comforted.  I'm tellin' ya -- it never rains.  It pours.  This.  World.  Blows.  When's the train for the next one?
Good Lord, but some of you people are bloody impatient.   "Sonny, where's the latest news?"  "Sonny, where's the love gone?"  "Sonny, have you seen my shoes?"   Forgive me -- sometimes this job thing of mine takes hold and eats away my time.    Like today.  It's Monday, ergo, one must contend with the madness of the previous weekend.  However, there   was   no madness.  All flash, no crash.  Not that I'm COMPLAINING, mind you...it's just that this means I get to spend multiple hours digging through paperwork.  My desk is now clean.  -- okay, "clean" is not the best descriptor.  It's "free from a lot of random crap being piled on top of it."  Better?    ******  It's been very interesting to observe the changing of the interoffice dynamics here since new people arrived.  Those who have been here for a while and have done a lot of work [raises hand] now appear to be on the outside looking in.  Oh, it's not that I  wish  I spent multiple hours in meetings, but...  Picture this:  you've been working in a certain field, say,  higher education administration , for nigh on ten years.  You feel that you've done a more-or-less non-utterly-sucky job at it.  You've worked at, say,  three different institutions.  You've been given an increasingly larger number of priorities and assignments.  Let's also just  hypothetically  state that the  merest  possibility exists that at the current institution you work for, a person or persons who are in a higher position than you have been providing moronically less-than-quality work, and you -- based on who you are and the damnable work ethic you possess -- have, again,  hypothetically  speaking here, covered the arse of said person or persons above you on  MULTIPLE  occasions.    -- and yet, somehow, with the changing of the guard, a division line now exists.  An almost-visible, almost-tangible "us" (the people on one hallway) versus "them" (the people on the other hallway) mentality.  A feeling of how the "uses" are like batteries, and we're interchangeable, no matter who we might be.  A cabbage could come in and do as effective a job as you are doing.    Welcome to the "us" -- or rather, "me" -- feeling right now.  ...and yes, I can see how this might fly in the face of my earlier posting about Jessica.  But, it doesn't.  Swear to G-d, if it was not for the RA's, and  some  of the students here, I'd blow this joint in a heartbeat.  People wonder why I put up with this?  The "kids."  I honestly love the ideals of higher education, and by G-d, I they are the reason I do this, have done this, and will continue to do this.  The administrivia is just a bad, bad, by-product of it all.  But...my gracious and giving nature can only extend so far.  I'm burnt, and burnt badly.  I'd like to be appreciated as a professional for a change.  Call me mad, but that's my wish.  Unless something   MIRACULOUS   happens in the course of the next few months...  I leave in May.  Or June, at the latest.    It's best I leave  here  before I leave the field.    And you've heard (okay, "read") it here first.
I think I just had a religious experience.  After two days of trying to download the new trailer for  The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King , I finally succeeded in proving my geekiness and did so.  Just about three minutes ago.  Holy Elvis, this looks amazing.  I've read the books at least a dozen times.  I've read  The Silmarillion , and the "lost" writings of Tolkien.  I freakin'  KNOW  what's going to happen in this movie, but...I honestly don't have a
