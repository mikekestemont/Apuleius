......"You're a vegetable, you're a vegetable / Still they hate you, you're a vegetable / You're just a buffet, you're a vegetable / They eat off of you, you're a vegetable..."???????  It's really just a random though. Which is why it's kinda cool to have a blog..cause I can just post this type of random shit as it comes to me. Fuckin cool!
The hotel in which i work is by no means a road-side Holiday Inn. It is very bougie. So that means our cliente are mostly 'well to do' types. Basically to make a long story as short as possible. I get sooooo pissed off that these guests repeatedly bring me $20 bills (or higher) to constantly make change! And while I'm sure that a good part of my pissed-offness is becuz I'm pretty broke,  but still it pisses me off to no end to have to constantly make change for  these yuppy -upitty fucks!
Right now I am on avery limited budget. There was like barely ANY food in the frig. I get paid on 8/20, but I need to eat tween now and then, right? So I figure I'd go to the grocery store and get a couple of things that will last for about a week and get me by until I can buy more. Makes sense, right? So I essentially go buy, some turkey bologna, mayo, bread, cereal and milk. When I get home and start putting these items away, I kinda took a step back and realized I am turning to Theo from that one episode of The Cosby Show. You remember it was the very first epiode and Cliff and Clair were concerned with Theo's lackluster grades? Cliff went to to talk to him, and he expressed that he didnt need to do exceptionally well in High School b/c he wasnt going to college. He was gonna get a 'regular' job. Then Cliff pulled out the Monopoly (Which I gotta buy. I havent played in sooooooo long.)money, and started breaking down people's real life expenses. And at the end, Theo thought he had it all figured out and Cliff was like "There is a problem! You havent eaten yet!", then snatched the last couple of bills from Theo's hand. And Theo snatched back a bill and said........"I CAN GET BY ON BOLOGNA AND CEREAL!" Remember that? LOL. Well goddamn if that aint my grown ass!
Fuck street gangs and the such....NOTHING scares me more than a group of drunk ass white boys! Them fuckers are liable to do ANYTHING. And then the thing is.....they be pissy drunk off of 2 budweisers! I never understood that shit. White people in general scare me,  and when you get to multiplying them and adding the element of drunkness,  it's a wrap!  And if you read this...and you happen to be white, please dont be offended. But you gotta know that you guys are scary!
You know Dilated Peoples' song 'This Way' featuring Kanye West? There's a part in the song where it says "I know there's things in my life that I'ma let go starting tonight"? That lyric has been replaying in my head like the last 3 days or so. I think Im gonna steal some print paper from work and write it in marker and and put it on my bedroom wall. Yet another random thought!
...well sorta! I didnt think my sweetie was checking this thing, but apparently she is. B/C she told me that my ass needs to do a new blog. Hehehehe. Anyways I dont know if I have much to blog about at the moment. Just have a couple of random thoughts floating thru my head. I suppose I'll share. For one...Prince's song " Gett Off" is stuck in my head. How is that for random? Anyways....I was at home last night watching VH1-Soul channel like I frequently do (right KK? LOL) when India. Arie's "Ready For Love" came on. It got me to thinking of how when that song first came out I was SOOOOOOO feeling it. Like really deep down in my biz-ones, ya know? And the part where she says 'they say watch what you wish for, cause you may receive'. And that shit really happened to me. I wished for a love, and dammit I got it. But what I'm realizing is that once I got it, I maintained it for a minute, but I got unfocused. I dont wanna say that I took it for granted cause I try not to take anyone for granted, but I will admit to getting unfocused. So upon hearing the song and having that thought.....THE IDEA/INSPIRATION FOR A NEW POEM came to me. You dont understand....I just havent found the inspiration to write shit resembling a poem in sooooooo long. But it came to me. I think it's gonna be called "My Apologies To My Love (Songs). Basically Im gonna be apologizing to my love and some of my favorite love songs using the titles of some of my favorite songs about love. Get it? If not, I may find the courage to post it. We'll see.
I went to this outdoor jazz festival with a couple friends today. And you know damn near ANY outdoor fest that black people are a part of, they will have a bunch of vendors out there selling shit. There was this one brother from Oklahoma City that had a booth set up. He had all sorts of ol' skool posters and nic nacs and shit. I saw the booth from about 30 yards away and I knew if I went over there I was gonna be some shit. I very well could be a complusive spender. So anyways I felt like Pookie when the crack was calling him .Cause that booth was YELLING for my ass to come over. And went over I did. As soon as I got there I knew what I was gonna buy. They were on display. It was blow up covers of Ebony and Life magazines. The Ebony cover had ALL of t
