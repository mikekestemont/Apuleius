An important part of the retreat is to show the children of the camps that we KPs around the world do in fact love and support them even though we cannot visit them.  So I am asking the attendees of the KOA National Camp in Pennsylvania from July 2-5 to sign cards and write letters of encouragement to the children to show their support.  Since we have been given the use of a large hall at Gandhi Memorial College for free, the costs are limited to transport (renting buses to drive the kids to and from their homes to the college each day, as well as on tours of Jammu city), food (serving lunch and snacks each day) and finally admission to places we visit such as the cinema hall. Raising money for this will not be difficult.   So I am also asking for youth to donate gifts. Depending on how much we raise, this does not need to be limited to the attendees of the retreat, but rather all the children in all the camps (this numbers in the thousands).  The idea behind this is for you to share your own passions with these kids. For example, if there is a book or books or comics that touched you as a kid, or as a teenager why not donate them (well, a hindi version)? If you are a musician why not donate an instrument? If you enjoy painting, why not donate paintbrushes and paper? If you enjoy soccer/football, why not donate footballs? If you want them to listen to music, why not donate radios, or a CD player and burn them some CDs. There are a myriad of possibilities.  To buy more for the dollar, I will make these purchases in Delhi and Jammu. Simply send the check and specify how you want the money to be spent. If you can also send a card or letter of encouragement (and even a photo of yourself) along with the check, I can give them the card or letter (and photo) along with your gift.  If you cannot think of anything specific to donate, then please help pay for the general costs of the Retreat.  Please send your checks, cards, letters, photos etc to: Dhiraj Bakaya 42 Meadow Court Sinking Spring, PA 19608  Checks should be made payable to KOA (Kashmiri Overseas Association). You can add "Jammu Retreat" in the memo. Please get them to me by Thursday July 15.  Please note if you are writing to the children, they are fluent in Hindi, are generally also proficient in Kashmiri, and have a very limited understanding of English. So if you are going to write in English please keep it simple, though I am sure their teachers will translate for them. What is more important than for them to understand all the words is to have something in their hands which shows you care.  If you have any more questions on this please let me know. My email address is dhirajbakaya@yahoo.com.  To ensure we do not overdo some gifts, I will endeavor to post updates on here on how much has been raised thus far and what the money is to be used for.  Thanks everyone!   Dhiraj
Namaskar All,  I have set up this blog to provide you all an update on the planning of the Retreat in Jammu from July 24-26.  What is the retreat?  It is going to be held at Gandhi Memorial College on the outskirts of Jammu City from Saturday July 24 through Monday July 26.  We are expecting about 80 kids from the Muthi, Mishriwalla and Nagrota Kashmiri Pandit refugee camps on each day. The likely age group shall be ages 12 and above.  The goal of this event is to provide an educational, fun-filled and inspirational experience to the underprivileged KP refugee camp children of the Jammu region. We shall attempt to bring the world to them, and share with them a glimpse of the worlds of music, art, culture, history and to discuss with them their futures, to motivate them and ultimately to help provide them opportunities.  The days will be filled by partaking in various activities, from sports and games, to discussions and guest speakers, to demonstrations and learning. We want to inspire and educate the children. We will provide advice and show them their part in the future of the Kashmiri Pandit community. We will also take tours of Jammu sights, such as Ragunath Mandir, Bahu Fort, etc We will also try and watch a Bollywood film at a cinema hall!  Following the program, we will have a better idea of what the children need in the future - by the way of books to improve their school library, perhaps computers and software, clothes, etc  They are currently receiving education in schools, as well as basic health care and their parents receive a small monthly allowance from the Government. What this program wants to do instead is to energise their spirits and show them that the worldwide KP community supports them.  Please check back here over the coming days and weeks to see how all is progressing!  Thanks,   Dhiraj
