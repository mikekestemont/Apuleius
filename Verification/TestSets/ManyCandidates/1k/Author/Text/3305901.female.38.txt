Hey, have you tried Sal's pizza? The place is owned by the same people that run the Wig & Pen, they even have a lot of the same menu items. I'm tellin ya they make the best pie in town. I highly recommend it.
Look ma, it's the  urlLink Church Sign Generator .
So fuck, you live your life trying to be a nice guy with a reputation for giving head to bisexual chicks, no problems except for the usual shit. So a few nights ago I was home watching "Deliverance" with my room-mate - no queer jokes please, I get enough of those from  urlLink cootersnap . And hey, it was on, it wasn't like we went to the effort to put in a tape. Anyway, Ned's big scene was coming up in maybe 10 or 15 minutes, I forget which, I hadn't watched it for the past couple of months. Anyway, I had just eaten a big hamburger pizza (don't forget the pig is a filthy animal) and the pressure in my lower regions was calling to be relieved. So I thought I'd hit the can, do my business, and get back with a few minutes to spare for Ned's career-defining role. Unfortunately, this was not to be the case.  As soon as I sat down on the throne I knew something was amiss.  However, out of deference to some of my fairer readers, I will not go into the graphics of the ensuing mishap that, suffice it to say, felt like my entrails were being ripped out in a staccato fashion. This went on for what seemed like hours, but really only lasted until the next commercial break during "Deliverance". Yes, I missed Ned's stellar performance, but certainly put on one of my own. Did I squeal like a pig? What are you, some kind of sick fuck? Pigs are unclean... I already told you. I'd like to think I bellowed more like a bull in heat.  Up! I gotta call. Seems like Mrs. Schuber needs a ride to Hy-Vee for her afternoon coffee clatch. Man, these afternoon hacking shifts are boring as fuck.

Second-time moms who claim they don't want another baby shower because it wouldn't be appropriate, then change their minds and invite SO MANY people that they end up having TWO showers for the second kids.  Grrrr.....  (Off to host the final shower; see y'all tonight)
