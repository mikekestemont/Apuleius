So I'm writing one of my last koho articles today. The koho is a magazine for our city in which they distribute to everyone registered as a citizen receives. I normally write about pretty benign topics, but I've heard of some other people who are in my position writing about more meaty issues. Some people tend to write even more fluffy crap than I do. I think this is disappointing. Why castrate the foreigner to write about prosaic things like holidays in america? Sure it's important, and also probably rude to assume that some of the people way out here have any idea what halloween is. Still, they should allow people to write about what they want to. Fortunately for me, I never really considered this the place to write about my grievances or a place to grind my axe, and have always really enjoyed my little articles in Japanese (although they do a lot of editing to make my articles sound natural). I have other places to do that, more or less. So far it seems that what I've written about is pretty much been related to my hometown, Minneapolis. It's actually pretty odd writing about something like this because my hometown seems like such a mosaic of images now rather than a real place. Luckily i was aware of this when I went home last time. I wrote about my family's cabin in the north of the state in a way that couldn't match up with the reality of it. Not in a good or bad way, but just not the same, as I don't remember it clearly the way that it really is. Most of America kind of seems that way right now, kind of a mosaic of my ideas and images, rather than a real place. Not that I'm conflicted or anything like that. America and Japan are both great places, it's just that I am physically here, and so this part of my life seems more real to me that my life in the states right now.  Anyway, on topic, this month's koho article will be about the fourth of july. Ah, I'm such a hypocrite.
I was talking to my Kacho about my latest monthly newsletter. I was talking about what 'white flight' is, and his perspective was interesting, in the respect that he thought most whites in the states lived in the cities, and that the minorities where in the suburbs. I suppose it's not that clear cut anymore, but it is pretty much the opposite. The upper middle class wealth all flees to the suburbs. Anyway, this was all historical, talking about the 60's and 70's. It did all happen then. It's a fact. Sure I suppose paradigms are shifting, but it's pretty hard not to see suburban sprawl. There isn't the distinct difference between Urban and Suburban as there is in the US. At least not that I'm aware of.    And totally unrelated.    I was harrasing this woman in my division telling her (her name is Uehara) that there's a station in Tokyo named uehara and that's what her name reminds me of. She gave me one of those forced grins and in an 'I'm humoring you' kind of way was like 'it certainly is wierd to have a place name the same as your last name'.
So part of my job title is to translate for foreign vistitors to my city. We have a large group of foreigners from the U.S. coming to my city later this month, and I've known about for quite awhile.  But what gets me is that they're hiding me from the group that's coming. They don't want the group to meet the foreigners in the area. So they are keeping me from helping them at all which doesn't make a lot of sense to me.   I'd be livid, but I think it would be in vain. oh well.
You know many people talk about the lack of this here, and I was pleasantly suprised at how much there is here. I worked at Broder's in Minneapolis (which had a pleasant variety of cheeses) and also at a Cheese store in Cambridge, MA for a very short amount of time, and have, well amassed will sound grandiliquent, but so it goes, a fair amount of knowledge of it.   While being down here, I've been able to find mostly anything: reggiano, grueyere, fresh mozzerella. I even brought my own chevre with me from San Francisco on my way here last year, but found at the grocery store here. More than a pleasant suprise. Although did not find the white cheddar or goat gouda that I had brought with me.   One thing that I've found to be quite tasty is adding gorgonzola and black bean natto to my pasta. It tastes great. Natto can be slimy, but black blean natto is much less so. The gorgonzola canceles all that out too, and makes one killer pasta.   I introduced the Chevre they sell here in my city at a cooking class I had in March. Just intoning the word 'goat' to these people makes them think that it will be the most disgusting thing in the world, which is unfortunate. But as they made there sandwiches, they all raved about it. One of my participants took the menu home, invited some friends over and made goat cheese sandwiches! great story.
As I was visiting LA last month, stuck in traffic driving from the Getty Museum, I couldn't help but be struck by the traffic. Although I don't live in the heart of it, I am living in train society. The breadth of the freeways was to my somewhat reverse culture shocked eyes, was astounding. Six lanes going both ways, I felt like a stadium could fit end to end with in the width of the freeway system. I would be winded running from one side to the other.   Driving in Fukuoka as well, and then comparing it to LA was also interesting. When I first went to Fukuoka, there is a city tollway t
