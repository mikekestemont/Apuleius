uhhhhhhh... I don't know. Brooke got my e-mail... yeah. chatted with her a bit... don't know.  I just don't understand. you think... maybe that's my problem... you think things are going one way, stuff happens, list of possible reasons for stuff happening, then when inquiry is made, nothing is really cleared up. not sure if things actually were going the way you had thought, not sure why stuff happened, not sure what to do, just know that Brooke doesn't feel well. and I'm afraid that it's my fault.  she doesn't want our friendship to change. I don't want our friendship to change. she doesn't want it to be weird, she says she doesn't feel weird. I don't want it to be weird, I don't know how I feel. I still like her, I know that, but I am brought back to the question of fascination... she doesn't want a relationship at this point, ok, that's all well and good but... she doesn't think she feels the same way but she's never thought about it. I don't know, I don't know, I don't know...God help me, I think I'm losing again.
I did it. I just finished writing Brooke; telling her how I felt; laying it all out on the line.  I would rather of done this in person, face to face, but I truly felt that God wanted me to do it now. OH GOD! you are my only hope, my salvation, my King. to You be the glory and honor forever and ever. Amen.
and now...
okay...
well, well, well...everyone just relax, i have arrived. jmp
waiting... waiting for the mail man... or at least the you have new mail signifier on the computer... I'm sure everyone is just busy... at least that's what I'm going to believe for now. habitat was sweet as molassas! of course there are things to improve, but that'll always be the case. I'd have to say that it was a complete success, especially for the first night. but if we can keep the numbers we had tonight, and have that to grow from, that would be sooo sweet. sweet like the swiss chocolate I had yesterday. mmm mmm good!   Johnny was back at work today... it's good that he's back around after his 10 day hiatus south of the mason dixon line. then our boss John was just extra JF today. I don't know what his deal is. Bobeng attributes it to his diabetes. I suppose that's a good reason, but geez! I really need to start making some money on the side. Windy City just doesn't cut it if I want to actually get an apartment. yikes! financial resposibility. oh, it turns out that my parking ticket fine was due yesterday. so I missed out on that, have to pay an extra $10 now. what really bites it is that when my mom called me at work to tell me, I found out she was sick with a massive fever and just getting ready for my dad to come home and take her to the doctor. God bless health insurance! I hope she gets better soon, she seems to have this nasty habit of sickness clinging to her. here's to God breaking that curse!  well hopefully soon I'll now something more. I'm still waiting for some form of enlightenment.
another day another reason to keep going... had the big true love waits ceremony in youth tonight. everything ended up going really well which is always a good thing. worship was smokin' and everbody seemed in a good mood. after youth we set up for the first night of habitat tommorrow. it took a while for us to get it all together, but it's lookin' quite nice. Alex is doin' a kick ass job with the lights, and the band gets tighter every time they play. once it was all finally set up, we took some time and prayed for everyone there ("the hot seat") it was good, and much needed I think. Handler is quite sick, runnin' a 102 temp earlier in the day, I'm prayin' that he's feeling better tommorrow. hopefully God and those antibiotics he got today will do the trick. ahhh, then Denny's. always a treat. well it was denny's, nuff said.   I still haven't sent in my payment for that stupid parking ticket, it has to be there by Friday! I'll have to spend more and send it overnight or something now. grrrr! got to send in my car payment too! stupid growing up and being responsible thing. I hope that I can do a good job of teaching my kids early to be financially responsible, it only get harder to learn as you get older...   sent off a couple e-mails to people I haven't seen in some time now last night. it was good to hear from them again. I hope that we can do a better job of keeping up with one another again this time. I always enjoy conversation; even if it is over e-mail. then when I do see them again at least I have some idea of what's been happening and we're able to just enjoy each other's presence. both of 'em (girls I've previously had interest in actually) have serious relationships right now. probably headed toward marriage. I'm less sure about one than the other, but both seem to be doing well. it's kind of weird that the last three girls I've liked are all in relationships headed toward marriage. one is gettin' hitched early this summer even! no matter, I'll have my day soon enough. whenever God decides that it's time. Brooke... hmmm... nothing further as of now. I wrote her last night as well, but I haven't heard back. I wish I knew what was going on inside that pretty little head of hers.  looking forward to tommorrow. looking forward to learning more about God and having a deeper relationship with Him. looking forward to ending this post and going to bed.
ok, so I'm the only one on this blog right now and I've been doing a
