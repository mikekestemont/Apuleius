Right now Neopets has a game called  urlLink A Cinderella Story . Actually, I hesitate to call it a game because it's more like advertising. It's a tie-in to hopefully get you interested in seeing the movie. But, whether or not you're interested in the movie, it's an easy way to pick up an extra 600 neopoints a day. Granted, the questions are all a bit on the silly side, but you only have to answer five of them per game. There are no wrong answers, so you're guaranteed a perfect score just by answering them. At 200 points a game, times three games and that's 600 easy points.  I also have another game to add to this section. It's called  urlLink Star Sisterz: Sisterz Speak . This game is also a marketing tie-in, so they've made it pretty easy. It's a very simple matching game. I would suggest playing it through once or twice to get an idea of what you're supposed to do. Then, after you're sure you have the hang of it, play it for a score to send. They recently cut the scoring back to 75 neopoints per 100 game points, but you should be able to make 1000 points daily from it fairly easily. You are given the option now of making another 50 neopoints per e-mail address you provide to them for referrals (up to three times a day). Personally, I'm not comfortable signing up my friends' e-mail addresses for advertising.  Now you're on your way to being a Neopets tycoon!
urlLink BVI Trivia Answers   I've played the game about thirty times through, and these are all the different questions I've seen. If there is one that I've missed, please neomail (FloridaGirl_82) me and I'll add it to the list. If you're not sure where the game is, you can find it  urlLink here . Each perfect score is worth 300 neopoints, for a total of 900 nps. daily. Good luck!   Who is the director of the movie King Arthur?
