No,I aint suffering from alzheimers nor a rare and desirable form of selective amnesia...though I do fake it off and on when my buddies come to ask me the money I owe them.... Today I just woke up to realise..."Hey I am a scientist (not a full blooded one but working towards becoming one soon though) and I have to look like one to fit my role!!" Well,being just 24 and endowed with looks that make me look younger than I already am...it became painfully evident to me that it would be nothing short of a herculean task to sport the look that I wanted to. I started with an uneven haircut....home made and improvised upon...to give the impression that I was rather too busy to visit a saloon. My clothes had to reflect my status quo as well...so out went my jeans and psychedellic green/red Ts and in came loose ill fitting cords,checked shirts,loafers and a horn rimmed spectacle to add the icing on the cake. But still I had this nagging feeling that there was something missing......and then as luck would have had it...reality dawned upon me.....I needed the brains of a scientist too!! Bottomline is that there is nothing that defines a scientist other than attitude.....and for those of you who have had the fortune or misfortune of knowing one....youd soon agree that either you can love them or hate them...theres no middle path about it. Having been in this elite company for a few years....I have met the best and the worst of the ilk....people which our gene pool could have done wonderfully without...and then people without whom our gene pool might not have existed in the first place. Its a mixed bag of sorts...but it doesnt take a man of immense perception and deep insight to realise that the brilliant(est) of minds sport the craziest and funkiest of attitudes too...ppl may call it eccentricity....I prefer to call it "being myself" syndrome. And whether I accept it or not...and as much as I have tried to resist it....the years gone by have left an indellible mark on my psyche.....its inevitable that some of the effects of company that I keep had to rub off on me.....nothing explains the title of this blog any better!!  So in retrospect....."Do I regret my decision of taking up research?"....I ask myself this very often while gazing into the skies,counting stars or sitting by the lake near my house....I ask myself this also while I am gazing at well endowed babes...or counting sheeps or sitting by my spectrometer or bacteria culture at night....and the answer depends upon the ambience!  Its about the closest that u can get to the ultimate truth that girls ( at least the ones worth fantasizing about!!) dont fancy a swing with the intellegentia so to say.The more burgeoise u are the better ur chances of winning in the date and mate game... and of course it doesnt hurt if your surname is Gates,Rothschilds etc and you got a stereo system with the latest sleek Porsche or Lamborghini wrapped around it....  Nerds as our ilk is called find it better to ride a cycle to their office....and I doubt it if our wallets contain anything more useful than the photo of our pet gold fish or dog,a few equations we thought of while we were answering natures call and a long list of guys (6 ft tall,muscular and violent!!) we wish to avoid in case they come around asking for us to solve their assignments or to beat a million shades of shit out of us cos the money we owe them is long over due!  Either way, a scientists life is all about isolation....about social deprievation..all about self inflicted problems and majorly about being an iconoclast. The herd instinct amongst scientists in this regard make sheeps look like independent thinkers!  Err....I think its pretty late to dwelve more into a scientists life and his mind....cos Id be late for work....(though punctuality isnt the hallmark of scientists anyways)...but lemme just wind up with the fact that lifes not a bed of roses ...but neither is it a matress of thorns...and I shall soon get around to elaborating upon the fun aspects of being what I am soon... Till then...try improvising on the equation on my title bar!!!

urlLink   So,I ultimately decided that I should oblige all my fans out there who were dying to catch a glimpse of the gr8 one in flesh and blood.Well,thats me.....just turned 24....enjoyed every bit of the days gone by and nothings gonna make me change my mind about enjoying every second that comes my way from now as well! These pics are from my trip to Amsterdam and Brussels for Christmas and New Year...yeah I agree that there were pics at better locations that I could have put up...but then it would have been a gross injustice to the architects and the inhabitants of those places...cos all of u would have been too busy swooning over me.Ha ha!!Well...compliments are very welcome....and criticisms if any...I doubt there shall be..but in the rare circumstances that people find it iressistable to let the green eyed monster take over.....please dont hesitate in posting them as well...but dnt expect an answer that exceeds more than 2 words...f&amp;%* yo%!!
Put the key of despair into the lock of apathy.Turn the knob of mediocrity slowly and open the gates of despondency---welcome to a day in the average office!  Well,its hard enough putting up with an Italian boss (no she doesnt head the mafia and I dont work for 1) but as luck would have had it I was almost going to land up with an Italian lady as Prime Minister of my country!!!Talk about a double blow!  So,back to the office and here I am indulging in my favourite passtime....cursing my boss and the work "it" gives me. Research sucks...it sucks big time and I shall get around to justifying my stance on it pretty soon. The only bright part of being i
