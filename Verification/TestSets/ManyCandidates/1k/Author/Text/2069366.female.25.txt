Yesterday was kinda moody. Surrounded with tempered 'aroma' where I could sense the anger feeling. Basically oneself could show off the anger when someone who get near to that person who you are not suppose to be although you do nothing wrong. What's make that person who expresses the temper? Not satisfy? Angry with something or someone? Or to much thinking that you couldn't get the answer? Here is what I have found out the sources about the 'anger':     The Nature of Anger     Anger is "an emotional state that varies in intensity from mild irritation to intense fury and rage," according to Charles Spielberger, PhD, a psychologist who specializes in the study of anger. Like other emotions, it is accompanied by physiological and biological changes; when you get angry, your heart rate and blood pressure go up, as do the levels of your energy hormones, adrenaline, and noradrenaline.  Anger can be caused by both external and internal events. You could be angry at a specific person(Such as a coworker or supervisor) or event (a traffic jam, a canceled flight),or your anger could be caused by worrying or brooding about your personal problems.Memories of traumatic or enraging events can also trigger angry feelings.      Expressing Anger     The instinctive, natural way to express anger is to respond aggressively. Anger is a natural, adaptive response to threats; it inspires powerful, often aggressive, feelings and behaviors, which allow us to fight and to defend ourselves when we are attacked. A certain amount of anger, therefore, is necessary to our survival.   On the other hand, we can't physically lash out at every person or object that irritates or annoys us; laws, social norms, and common sense place limits on how far our anger can take us.  People use a variety of both conscious and unconscious processes to deal with their angry feelings. The three main approaches are expressing, suppressing, and calming. Expressing your angry feelings in an assertive not aggressive manner is the healthiest way to express anger. To do this, you have to learn how to make clear what your needs are, and how to get them met, without hurting others. Being assertive doesn't mean being pushy or demanding; it means being respectful of yourself and others.   Anger can be suppressed, and then converted or redirected. This happens when you hold in your anger, stop thinking about it, and focus on something positive. The aim is to inhibit or suppress your anger and convert it into more constructive behavior. The danger in this type of response is that if it isn't allowed outward expression, your anger can turn inward on yourself. Anger turned inward may cause hypertension, high blood pressure, or depression.   Unexpressed anger can create other problems. It can lead to pathological expressions of anger, such as passive-aggressive behavior (getting back at people indirectly, without telling them why, rather than confronting them head-on) or a personality that seems perpetually cynical and hostile. People who are constantly putting others down, criticizing everything, and making cynical comments haven't learned how to constructively express their anger. Not surprisingly, they aren't likely to have many successful relationships.   Finally, you can calm down inside. This means not just controlling your outward behavior, but also controlling your internal responses, taking steps to lower your heart rate, calm yourself down, and let the feelings subside.   As Dr. Spielberger notes, "when none of these three techniques work, that's when someone or something is going to get hurt."   Sound interesting? Have you guys watch 'Anger Management'? Pretty funny movie!  :)
Yesterday night I was watching TV at home. Kinda bored staying the in the house when no one around except my 3rd brother sleeping soundly at the living hall. Then Joe called me to let me know that he wanted to return back my Digital Camera and as well called me to yam char at Mid Valley, Kim Gary's Restaurant. That was the time almost 10.00pm. Me, Joe, Jeffery, Alan and Mee Lan called our own dishes for their own supper or dinner.    The interior of the restaurant.    I like the bulp mini lights in here.    My French Toast - yummies~    Toast into cutting edges.    I dunno what kind of burger is this. ;)    My tea...hot tea.    Our last call drinks.  Overall, we were enjoying ourselves. Jokes around while check out some babes and guys in the restaurant but unluckily Joe can't get to shoot the babe's picture which my friends (the guys) claimed 'she' was natural beautiful. Heee
This morning was kind of moody because of the stomach troubling my body but then I managed to control my emotion and pain. I took medicines...phew...luckily I remember to bring the pain-killer. Oh, well...guess nothing much to report.
Yesterday my family asked me how come I got back home so early. Oh, dear.....! I told them nothing much to do in the office so here I am. Then my eldest brother came back checking on his left armpit...the acne...big gigantic pimple at least 4cm size! WOW~ The head pustule came out with juicy yellowish color blister....yucks! He asked me to help him to squeeze out the pustules....Yheeww~ I squeezed pathetically so that the whole damn pustules out it. Bloody out from his armpit while he can't stand the pain on his armpit. Kinda funny when seeing my brother curse in pain. Heeheee.  Hmmm......I should keep in clean and drink more water to get out of these gigantic pimple especially on the armpit side. LOL.
Today is the 1st blogging here. I do not know what to say here but I would rather say....at last I could really spend some minutes to write something here.  Today not much happening since last weekends. Last weekends were amazing as I spent almost half of the day sleeping like a Sleeping Beauty. Last Saturday I woke up at 6.00pm and slept at 6.30am. On Sunday I woke up at 5.30pm. ;)  Sunday was a amazing day. I spent the day wth my ex-collegemates at his house. Kinda cool when someone (a guy) cooked spaghetti and beef steaks for all of 7 people f
