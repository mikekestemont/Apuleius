&nbsp; It all started on a bright Saturday morning.&nbsp; I stepped out of the car and onto the pavement, a desert of cigarette butts and soda cans, ready to kick some ass on the dance pads.&nbsp; I was pumped!&nbsp; I was&nbsp;primed!&nbsp;I  really  had to go to the restroom!&nbsp;&nbsp;That is probably the worst thing anyone who has never been to the Irving Mall can have to do.&nbsp; Irving Mall is a labyrinth filled with hidden passages, falling axes, traps and only one restroom that is hidden in a nuclear missile silo on the lower level inside Barnes and Noble, so the fact that I had never had to go to the restroom more urgently in my life was not at all a positive factor of the day.&nbsp; Evetually, I got to the information desk ("For the love of all things good where is the restroom!!") and left my 80-pound mark in the restroom.  &nbsp; 80-pound bowel movements aside, after about an hour of dodging arrows shooting out from the walls, I finally found the hidden passageway that led to Animation Town arcade.&nbsp; It was a bit more ramshackle than I am used to, but it made up for it with every single Bemani game ever devised by man, including the obscure boxing one wherein mechanical boxing gloves shoot out of the coin slot and grab your crown jewels during a fight.&nbsp; Another factor that made up for the appearance of the arcade was the IIDX machine.&nbsp; This machine's awesomeness could also be heard in Cuba, though.&nbsp; This sucker was  loud.&nbsp;  It also had a feature that activated when I tried to play, a feature that turned every song I once loved into a rasping caucphony when I attempted to press any buttons.&nbsp; I tried this game numerous times, needless to say.  &nbsp; Then I went to go look at the DDR machine.&nbsp; At this point in time, a man had the right pad's right arrow open and was performing an excorcism that would later prove futile.&nbsp; The demons in this pad were tough bastards, let me tell you.&nbsp; Either way, after the pad was reassembled, the tournament began.&nbsp; As always, I was up first against Razor Wind, which always impedes my progress in any tournament, seeing as how this guy, even after having to be torn from Guilty Gear XX with a crowbar, can kick my monkey ass something terrible.&nbsp; And that he did, and did so with gusto!&nbsp; Thereafter, I sat down in a rout, sipping a Mountain Dew from the adjacent Taco Bell, and began trying the other Bemani games.&nbsp; First on my list was Drum Mania, a game in which the player incoherently flails his arms to the funky beat and sometimes hits the electric drums.&nbsp; That's how I played, at least.&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few more tries, I was up against the seductress Cynthia, who could control the demons in the machine so that they would pick every song that I have either never played before or suck terribly at.&nbsp; So, I got whipped bad, but that was mainly because of Satan's presence in the Random Song Selector.  &nbsp; Once I was out of the tournament, I basically just sat back and watched Zack beat Razor Wind by a hair.&nbsp; A hair meaning Razor Wind gave up on Paranoia Survivor.&nbsp; So the money switched hands, I went home, and I complained about demons on the forums.  &nbsp; A job well done, I say!  - Bioclown
Sadly, I am not out of school yet.  Even after 10 years of dedicated service, they still won't let me graduate.  Turns out I have to go for two more years after this one before I can graduate and get on with my life.  And if that weren't enough, I have to do my work at above average levels in these three years, as well!  How can this travesty be permitted in the great state of Texas?   I'll tell you: White people.  That's it.  Plain and simple.  White people.  Part of the white person's psyche, along with azalia bushes,  is to make the children suffer, and make teenagers suffer even more.  These white yuppies were apparently beaten with lunch trays when they were in school, so now they exercise their power as members of the PTA by placing outrageous policies into the schools such as prohibiting hugs between anyone, guns, drugs and changing French fries to "Freedom fries."  They also seem to think that we have no life outside school, so they tend to load us down with work that has to be done, of all things.  How can we let these people into power?  I say we revolt! I can see it all now!  The SSWGDA!  The Students Say What Goes Down Association!  We will be in power and, well, the yuppies among us would immediately leap to power.  So, there goes that idea.  Bottom line, I'm not looking forward to going back to school.  I am looking forward to the Great Revolt and the anime club, though.
Gameworks is very far away from where I live.  If you don't know the geography between Dallas and Grapevine, it goes Dallas, Plano, Switzerland, France, Africa, London, and then Grapevine.  So needless to say, this was supposed to be a huge event that constituted such a huge journey.  Now, if you aren't familiar with the Gameworks establishment, you should probably know that Steven Spielberg is in charge of the entire operation, so the arcade is pretty much a giant warehouse filled with occult-industrial movie props and gigantic fat people at the Time Crisis II machine.  Obesity aside, Gameworks is like Mecca for most gamers.  They pray to Shigeru Miyamoto while facing Gameworks.  That's just how amazing Gameworks is.   Of course, when you try to organize an event at such a location, it works out so superbly that it attracts a total of two people including yourself.  Of course, the second person always arrives a couple hours after the "event" starts, and by then you have either died or ran out of money.  Luckily, I didn't die or r
