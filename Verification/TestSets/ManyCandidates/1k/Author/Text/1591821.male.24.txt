Good on you channel 7.  You take what is a great show from the ABC (vary rare I watched an ABC show) and then give it the Axe.  Why???  Cause you have no bloody idea how to schedule good shows.  First it was on at 10:30 on Monday nights (I think) and then it got moved to the 9:30 slot.  Why, as a pre-emptive strike to stop people from turning over to the other channels due to two high rating shows returning.    And then what do they expect... that people will just not turn over.  Are they for real.  If they had've left the show where it was, people would have watched it and it wouldn't be axed.  Good on you channel 7.  No really, good work.  Keep it up.  Hey, I'm sick of home and away, can you move that to a competitive slot so it can be axed too....?  q.
Yes that's right folks... Bar night was back in all its glory last night.  The best part was rocking up at 10 and only having to line up in 5 minutes.  Good on the door staff for keeping the line moving.  Once inside it was packed (when it's at its best) and doing a quick circuit took over an hour due to the constant bump-ins to people who I haven't seen in a while.  Was a godd night.  Got very loose and just chilled for the night.  I must say, there was an abundance of very good looking girls there too which curli concurred with.   One thing that annoys me is groups of guys in so-called gangs.  So down the bottom of the eagle bar there was a blew.  I'm tipping about 20 guys.  Half shouting 1-1-0 and the others shouting something different.  Anyway its on and was all in.  Sounds on bodies hitting ashphalt and body blows from fists and feet.    Anyway I was paying attention to one guy stalking another guy and he gets into fighting stance.  His stance was pretty good too, bouncing on the spot, feet 45 degrees out and should width apart.  I'm thinking ooh someone's about to get hurt here.  Pity the guy kicked like a fucking pussy and so very slow.    His mate was the same.  I can only think that the've just gotten their white belts or something coz it was very very poor and if I were that bad, I wouldn't be using it.  If that's the standard of fighters from other clubs, they are in for a world of pain.    Speaking of which, I am hanging to get back to training again.  The knee is not too far off I am hoping.  Still a little bit of soreness but hopefilly a little bit of light training  urlLink here  will flush the remaining fluid out and I can go back into full contact again.  I better get cracking q.
So last week I hear a radio promo for channel 10 bringing back Jackass!!  Fantastic news and a quick scan of the ever realiable TV Week confirmed my excitement.  So quarter to twelve rolls around last nite and on comes the MTV logo.  Now getting really pumped for their shenanigans and what do channel 10 do? They put on the bloody Osbournes.  Now don't get me wrong, they have their funny moments (especially the babysitter telling them to fuck off all the time!), but I would rather watch Jackass then a couple of pretensious teenagers with no discipline and their drug fucked old man.  So I wanna know which persons to blame... Surely not TV Week - they had to get their info from Channel 10 first.  So CHANNEL 10 - Get your bloody act together!  q.
So plans are under way for two of my mates to do a working holiday (i guess) in the red center.  Part of me thinks jealousy, coz a working holiday somewhere different would rock!! Me would be behind a bar in the states somewhere.  But that's a dream that can only be reached in the next month, and that wont be happening (working holiday must be 25 and under).  I was nearly on one about a year ago but decided to be wiser and stay here.  Anyway onto the other part, I'm wondering if its just this months flavour.  I hope not, I hope they go and have the time of their lives.  Hell, if I had the opportunity and ability, I would.  Well, i'll miss em heaps but they are only a phone away and its somewhere to stay for a big road trip!!  Speaking of... one is underway to the gong in Jan.  I smell trouble.  better do some work q.
So 8:30am I am feeling a lot of motivation.  I decide that I would finally do what I have put off for around 2 months now.  Yep, the big re-arrange.  So... 3pm later and I finally get to sit down.  I am happy with all the big stuff, it's just that I am not sure that I will remember where I put all the little stuff.  Maybe i'll enjoy it more tomorrow once my body recovers! q.
Wow! massively hungover.  lower case q was telling me i was talkin to myself when i got home.  very blind.  cheers to the rig show for the ride.    so in this hungover state, i couldn't help myself and joined up to  urlLink kings of chaos .  Heres to taking over the world! q
Ahh the Harp.  You have put yourself right up there next to eagle bar.  How good is it when chicks kiss!! Nothing excites the place (well the testosterone side anyway) more that it.  They did a good job of it too.  Something I will never tire of.  On a humorous note, I was telling the 'dilemma' how she iced me when I went to say hi earlier in the night.  Tapped her on the arm and she kept walkin.  So anyway as I was telling her this (which she apologised for anyway :) ) the dj spins up.... boom boom boom ba da boom boom... ice i
