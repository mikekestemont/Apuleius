So I was just sitting here thinking..."Where in the heck did June go???" I serioulsy don't know how time flew so fast. It just seemed like yesterday was June 1st. I swear the summer goes by entirely too fast! Anyway, so here's the rundown of what happened today. Got up and went to work and did entirely too much paperwork. Then after I got off work I came home and changed clothes then met Pete at the gym to lift. Tonite we worked on legs and lemme tell ya it HURT!!! My legs felt like rubber and I could barely walk! Then after working out I came back home and changed clothes and freshened up so I wouldn't be sweaty and smelly anymore. Then I headed back to Pete's place where I had this amazing Ziti that he made! It was so good and definitely hit the spot after a good hard workout! After dinner we both went over to one of our former co-workers house to load up a treadmill for our other co-worker Ramey. And this treadmill was heavy! And since my legs were already in bad shape it made it that much harder to haul around! After loading it up we followed Ramey back to her house and unloaded the sucker. By this time Pete and I were extra wore out so we told Ramey goodbye and headed back home. Although this doesn't sound like the most exciting day in the world it was definitely a humorous day! Oh the sights Pete and I saw driving around in beautiful Marion and Gas City! People make me laugh so much!!! :o) I am now doing laundry and waiting for it to dry so I can fold it and then head to bed. Unfortunately I have to be up at like 6:00am tomorrow cuz I have a mandatory meeting and then I'll be gone with one of my clients all day because he's going to a children's home. Well I'm done writing for now. Hope you all had a great day! Till next time........
Saturdays are a beautiful thing! There's no other day of the week when you can sleep in, get out of bed at 11 or 12, eat something, lay around, watch some tv, read, or do whatever you want and have no schedule pressing or have appointments to be at with people breathing down your neck! And I love Friday nights as well! Last nite was a great nite. I got home from work, took a little nap, and then Amy called and wanted to know if I wanted to go out with her and Mollie to Kokomo to eat at Panera and then get some coffee at Starbucks. How could I pass up that offer?! I couldn't say NO! So we went to Panera and ate and lemme tell ya'll that if you haven't ate there you need to cuz it's awesome! Then after that Amy wanted to go to the "Shoe Carnival" to find some new shoes (as if she needed another pair!). And can I just say that I hate the "Shoe Carnival"?! Granted they have a great selection of shoes, but I hate the atmosphere in that place! First of all they have this oldie music playing at a high volume that just drives me crazy. Then they have this person who interrupts the music I can't stand announcing that they have this great sale going on blah, blah, blah.... This announcement never fools me, but for most people in the store it does. After the announcement is made people go running around like chickens with their heads cut off grabbing as many shoes as possible. I wish I had a video camera to tape them all so they could see how smart they look. Ha ha! This running and scrambling around then leads to why the store looks the way it does....Shoes are strung everywhere, boxes are half open, you can't find the size you need cuz everything is mixed up, etc. Does anyone know what I'm talking about or am I just plain crazy?! And it doesn't matter if I'm in that store for 5 minutes or or an hour I always come out of there in a bad mood and in desperate need of some Prozac or something! Hey if you like the store take no offense to what I just said. I'm just simply saying that I can't stand that place!!! Anyway, after that we went to the mall and looked around which put me at ease somewhat. And then for the best part of the nite...STARBUCKS!!! I am addicted to that place! And I always get the same thing, a caramel frappucino...mmmmm!!! And I like the atmosphere of that place too...Laid back music playing, cool decorations inside, and the wonderful smell of coffee everywhere! So while we're in there drinking our coffee and chatting and having a good time Amy needed to go get a napkin or something. So she gets up to get the napkin and when she comes back she just starts telling the most random story about some guy staring at her with a pot of coffee in her hand or something. After she finishes the story I have no clue as to what she just said, but I wasn't going to say anything and just pretend that I understood, but Mollie speaks up and was like "What the heck are you talking about?!" And then I lost it! I just bust out laughing cuz Mollie said exactly what I was thinking! Amy became confused at this point because in her mind her story made perfect sense. Mollie and I on the other hand thought she had stepped into a time warp and was transported to another world where this "experience" happened to her. So Mollie and I continued to laugh for awhile while Amy remained confused. It was GREAT! Then we drove home and I chilled for awhile back at my apartment and read some of my new Relevant magazine and chatted to some f
