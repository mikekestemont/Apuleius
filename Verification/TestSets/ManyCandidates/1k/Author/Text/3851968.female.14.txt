our outreach was fun... my partner was non other than of course, my bestfriend, NotNot. our foster family was composed of Nanay Linda, Tatay Leby, Ineng and Jon. We expected to be doing lots of stuff like cleaning the house, doing the laundry... but instead our nanay told us not to do anything but take care of Ineng so that's what we did... Ü we took her around... (actually she was the one who gave us the tour.... hehe Ü) and we bought her food from the tindahan just across our house... where 3sha and robbie were staying... Ü (promise 3sh u'd make a good tindera! hehe Ü) we took pictures and when it was about... 11:00 am, i started cooking the porkchop... NotNot helped a little bit... Ü we ate lunch and they told me it was good.... NotNot loved it actually... diba Nots?? hehe Ü nway.... when it was about 1:00 pm, we gathered together... and the children played games with Norms and Pielle as the "gamemasters" !! Ü Go Pielle and Norms! hehe Ü after that we performed a not-so-prepared dance number... diba jam?? hehe Ü (sorry, i forgot the cd)... but still, jam danced gracefully as always!
