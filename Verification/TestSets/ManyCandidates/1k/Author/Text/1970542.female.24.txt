The race against time  i have a bodyfit (don't laugh) class to go to at 6.15, but I'm still eluting my protein, I can't leave it now Ive started and I feel very panicked, though theres nothing I can do. If I'd used enough matrix to start with it'd have been done just after lunchtime, but because I was watching my expenditure, I had to add more and wait a couple of hours for it to bind.  I should be pleased really, well I am, because theres loads of protein there. Oh well I have to go and collect fractions now,fingers crossed that I get it done in time...
One rule for them...  I've just had one of those conversations which has really angered me. Somebody struck up a conversation with me about the   urlLink 17 year old who has alleged she was raped by a group of professional football players.  He (who shall obviously remain nameless) said that since the girl had consented to sex with one of the men (apparently this is reported in the sun) then the courts would automatically not believe her since she was promiscuous. Of course none of us know what has really happened but I am appauled that people actually think like this. I doubt you'd ever hear somebody saying the same about men, haven't we got a right to decide what we do and who we do it with? I just can't explain how angry and upset this has made me feel.
The bugs are taking over   urlLink This  sort of thing really scares me. It's not so much that it's likely to happen but the fact that we are so unprepared and have continued to worsen the situation for years.  I'm going to have a look for more info on phage treatment. I can't believe it's not mentioned more, unless it's far less effective than I think.
The road to Borth/Death?  I've just had a late breakfast. It was then, with the prospect of yet another weekend with virtually no human contact and the thought of all the work I've got to get through, gnawing at me, that i decided I'd go for a drive before I came back into work. I'm saying this much, driving on coastal roads around west Wales is not a good form of stress relief, unless you really want to relieve your stress in the ultimate way.
Ooh it's autumn  It feels really cold this morning, no need for the air con in the lab, think I'll put the bunsens on instead!  It's really scared me, because it feels like it's almost Christmas, which means I really have started my final year of prac work. AAAGGGHHH! got to get on with it!
Passport photo hell!  Yes I know everyone moans about this, but I'm still going to have a rant anyway! It's that time of year again, when new membership cards etc. need to be issued. I have a photo that I can  bear  to look at and that is going on my NUS (again), however theres only so many times you can reuse these damn things before they get torn and so I've just been to get some new ones for my gym card. No matter how hard I try to get a reasonable photo these bloody machines never fail to reduce me to a blubbering wreck. My latest effort makes me look like I have a skin tone something like David Dickinson's. Needless to say I have not! Unfortunately I am far too tight to even consider having them retaken and so I'll have to be reminded how dreadful I look every time I go to the gym (but at least thats not very often)
Happy motoring  Just a quick one before I pack up and go home to say my car passed MOT without any problems, YIPEE. I could get to work without it, but I love driving, so I'd hate to be without it.
You're doing a PhD and you're lonely?.....and?  I've just been speaking to the new PhD student in our lab, for the first time. She has left her family miles away on another continent to come to Aberystwyth. Not suprisingly she feels very lonely and unsettled at the moment.  It has taken me 2 years to realise that doing a PhD is often as emotionally draining as it is mentally. I love my work but I feel I miss out on quite a lot because of it. I'm 23 now and I actually feel my life is going backwards, the only thing that's progressing, albeit very slowly, is my work. My personal life seems to be getting worse, I never meet new people and I feel the relationships I have with my few good friends are beginning to break down. I think this is all due to the inevitable stress which is increased by the thought of the final year of work looming ahead. Unfortunately it's a vicious circle I'm stressed so I take it out on my friends, which pisses them off so I think they don't like me so i think about work more and get more stressed..... All this aside it saddens me to see people unhappy, and I really hope that the whole experience is more enjoyable for her than it is for me most of the time. However it seems to be normal to feel lonely and isolated when doing a PhD, perhaps it's the individual nature of the work and/or, as a friend of mine says, that we are inclined to over analyse ourselves, as we do with our work.
Strange lab happenings  The phantom "shaker turner-offer" seems to have returned and has managed to delay my experiment by a few hours, which I could really do without. Also I suceeded in not squirting coomassie (bright blue) stain all over my lab coat and face, much to the disappointment of my colleagues. This last thing is amazing considering that I usuallly end up with it at least all over the sink.
Well It's taken me a long time to get my arse i
