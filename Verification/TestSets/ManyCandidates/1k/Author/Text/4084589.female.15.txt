So I'm surfing the net. And suddenly I say, "Hey, lets go to my blog and update it!" And so I go and what do I see? Or rather, what not? My Tag-Board, yes, the board. Its gone. Now, I laugh to myself and say, "Oh, I'll just get it back." And then I try. And try. And try. And then I realise I cant cuz  BLOGGERS A BLOODY FUCK !      Okay calm now. I'll get Jerry the Board back. (just named it jerry, you didnt miss out)   So I had a pretty boring day. Mainly because it ended at 2pm. Everyone's in school or studying here. Internet is my only friend. Jeez, I sound like a major social outcast there.     Oh god, she's blabbering.    I'm blabbering and talking to myself.   Will go talk on MSN or Friendster now.   Friendster's kinda lame now but thats a whole new topic .     Go.    Aight.Aight. I'm gonna focus on Jerry and his retrieval.
So I'm so bored yeah? That I thought of 101 things that people might never know about me. Have never been the mysterious type so here goes...     I was born on the most freaking stormy day in the history of Bangladesh. Thus the name Brishty. (Rain, doink!) I moved to Birmingham when I was three. I graduated from St. Benedicts Kindergarten in 1994. I will never go to my primary school alumni thing ever. Those were my shady days where I had no friends and the people were too Singaporean for me. ( No offence though) I can hold a grudge really well. I have stopped talking to people for months at a time.      I easily forgive if someone asks. Kinda weird huh? My favorite shoe brand is Adidas. Although I like slippers best. The worst day in my life will have to be the day my parents 'caught' me and realised the stuff I really do. It isnt so bad but to them it was earth-shattering. I don't like my school, but I am sticking it out as long as I can get into UCL. If I don't get into UCL, I will probably end up at UEA and that will be the end of my uni life. I like celebrating my birthday, because I love the attention. Thats one day you can call your own and its a step closer to that freedom who keep hearing about. My favorite author is Sylvia Plath solely because I have most of her books. I wish I had more time for recreational reading, but school takes up far too much time. I never used to short in my life. I was a tall baby, even back in the dark days. My all time favorite song is Rendenzous by Craig David. My favorite band is Evanescence. I love their music and Amy Lee has an awesome voice. I don't listen to Oasis anymore. It opens up too many wounds. The dumbest thing I have ever done was getting caught up with my social scene that I totally ignored other stuff and soon enough in the end it all came crashing down on me. The smartest thing I ever did was not ot be stupid and mope over it. :) I far prefer Smirnoff to Bacardi. The only time I have ever smoked pot was horrible for me. I have no desire to touch it (pot, not men, J). :) I don't think I have an addictive personality. It's mostly to set an example. I have never stole cigarettes or alchohol and shall never do it due to previous accusations. Tight shirts is the biggest turnoff I can think of. I have issues with telling people how I feel. I usually think they don't care and just let it build inside of me until I pop. I would cry if Charmed, OC, Alias or Gilmore Girls  were cancelled. I have cried in the past month for bad judgement. My duck,Sutha, is my best friend. I was not impressed with the Paris Hilton tape. It looked like she was in Baghdad. Diet Vanilla Pepsi = my drink of choice I collect bags and shoes now that I'm in UK. I can actually get the size. I want a yellow Volkswagon GTI or black Mitsubishi Evo. I have no political affiliation. I vote for whoever I think is less of a dumbass. I cant vote though but always felt that was my only ticket into the political world. My favorite gadget is by far the iPod.  Funny I dont have one. But I played around with Rhea's.  The dumbest thing I ever bought was my first walkman. It broke after a week and I never got it back from repairs. The best concert I ever went to was Evanscence when they came to London. They rocked out. I want to see      Usher      in concert. Most peopleI don't care about enough to fork over the cash. I am very self conscious of my appearance. I have seldom bouts of low self esteem. My main goal in life is to be a lawyer. I have never had serious boyfriends. I don't regret either, because I learned a lot from them. I have never played the lottery. I am too cheap. My biggest vise would be drinking entirely too many cherry cokes and eating too much chocolate. I sure do lead an exciting life. I love flying and hotel rooms.  I am a chicken when it comes to scary movies. Never made through one in the cinema. The first thing i will buy when I graduate from university  will be make a statement that I am not moving back in. I don't think I will ever get married. I don't think anyone would be able to put up with me. I don't know if i even care that much. My favorite holiday used to be Eid. Now it has no meaning, whatsoever. I hate Christmas food. I could not care less about sports. My favorite restaurant is Taco Bell. My least favorite restaurant is New Mumbai Vegetarian Restaurant.
