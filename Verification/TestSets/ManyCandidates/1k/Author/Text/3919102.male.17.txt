heeey errrybody i hope youve been checkin the profile daily to get the news on how my life is going! if you have, you havnt seen anything in a few days i think... anyway, i just felt like writing how the week/weekend has been so far. im at "b-a-d"'s house right now, its like 12:40&nbsp;and weve had actually a pretty fun day. we got up around 12, and brad played a VIDEO GAME! how fun lol... nah it was ok, i was just laying there sleeping pretty much. then we went and cut grass for about two and a half hours. that was cool... after that, we started working on a song just for the hell of it. we had just finished the remix to a song i made last night. you can listen to it here:  urlLink http://www.soundclick.com/bands/0/cthasupermanmusic.htm &nbsp; &nbsp; i think you can just click there then go to the song titled "get the fuukk down"... i thought it was funny when i made it (cause of the end) &nbsp; anyway, me and brad made the remix to that... but brad is sort of bad at recording so it took about 100000 takes to get it...............then.................. he didnt like it. so he rewrote most of it and it took about 100000 more takes to get it...&nbsp;oh wait he still hasnt, so we actually aren't done lol.  oh, gotta go... but i might say more later....FUN WEEKEND!
PHYLICIA!  man... this guuurl.... she just has this personality that makes you laugh... not at her, with her lol. its sort of messed up tho... simone and her are friends, and they are actually better friends than they were before because of me. i knew phylicia befor simone, and she always made it seem like she really liked me or thought i was hot (tho im not THAT great). shed be trippin all bad, but i thought it was just fun and games cause she had never even SEEN me before. so i didnt really take heed to all of the signs. then there was the fact that people were telling me that simone liked me, and samantha was oing her weird stuff and "sort of kinda maybe one day possibly almost starting to wanna get near to sort of thinking about almost liking me a little tiny bit", and this was ALL while i was with sophie (who is pretty messed up by the way). so i just laughed about the whole situation. then me and sophie broke up... then it got weird. most people kno of the crazy antics of me, simone, and smantha, but if you dont then TOO FUCKIN BAD hahaha. anyway, phylicia was always in the picture, but i couldnt take it TOO seriously, cause i didnt wanna go with a girl i had NEVER seen. tho... isaac told me she was hot, and he does help me make a lot of decisions... but yeah, i wasnt gonna get with a gurl that i COULDNT see ever or talk to on the phone with a lot. so... i igured it would be better to be friends... and we did... now shes like one of my best girl friends, and i talk to her about like errrything. its funny cause with both of us, we are always the people giving advice to friends, so now we had somebody to get advice from, so i did that repediatly. theeeeeennnn there was simone... ("dan dan daaaannnn" ~klarissa~) im so glad i got to know her over this time. shes a cool person to me... well RECENTLY... nevermind, thats another post. but yeah, phylicia! prefect! nice! hot! anndddd some other qualities i dont wanna say lol. but yeah, basically im jsut happy to have somebody DIFFERENT than others, but not in a way thats gonna get me called stupid and wrong and cussed at lol. the think is... simone and sophie were more similar than i had ever wanted to admit... from their history, to their parents, to their personalities... well actually simone is cooler is some areas, but sophie is cooler in others. but phylicia is DIFFERENT, shes more like me... just she keeps me entertained and laughin all the time. plus, she can make me smile from just lookin at me right lol and thats a big accomplishment lol. but YUP shes a girl to take home to momma... she works and she gets her education...  "thats some good shit right there" anywaysssssssssssssssssss talk later... gotta go to sleeeeeep!
So neeeeeshhhhaaaa.... nesha nesha nesha nesha nesha nesha nesha nesha nesha nesha nesha nesha nesha nesha... "you kno what... ima hurt you" lol yeah, nesha... thats a really cool girl. i didnt think that antwuane actually talked to cool people that id like. its funny cause when i first saw her i was like "that girl is really messed up... shes bein all mean to twuane" but i guess that was just it... she was just mean to twuane. lol she was really nice to me tho. it seems like ive known her for a LOT longer than a few weeks.... i remember how i though she liked me haha... funny... YUP!  i love knowing cool people  ~SUPERMAN!~
