*****Movie of the Year*****     "I was stunned by the cover with Elvis and all. I bought it and watched it this movie is awesome funny as hell and the dopest one of the year." - Nick  An ancient evil finds resistance in the most unlikely of places in this oddball comedy horror effort from Phantasm director Don Coscarelli. Resting in the confines of a Mud Creek, TX, nursing home after fading into obscurity following his departure from the limelight, an aging and embittered Elvis (Bruce Campbell) befriends a delusional patient named Jack (Ossie Davis) who claims to be John F. Kennedy. It seems that at the height of his popularity Elvis had switched identities with a convincing double, and, upon the death of the substitute, missed his chance to reclaim his former fame. Despite his anger at never having made a comeback, Elvis finds a new reason to live when Jack tips him off to an evil mummy that is feasting on the souls of hapless nursing home inhabitants. Before long the geriatric duo must muster the strength to fend off the malevolent soul sucker lest they ultimately fall prey to the fearsome Bubba Ho-Tep (Bob Ivy).     Acting Rating: 9.5/10 Story Rating: 10/10 Sound/Music: 10/10  (Elvis!! of course)  Overall Rating: F@!#in 20!!!! and plenty agree
Sorry For The Wait  I've gone awhile mainly because I was hanging wit my big sis. I've been talking around for another MC. And looking around Soundclick for one as well. And after a couple days in Alb. I had found three who just gave me a demo CD out the blue beacause they were handing them out around the city. I listened to it and they were ok. The lyrics were what I subjected too so I asked if I was to give you a beat could you make something they said sure. I thought how about the new one "look around" one of the ones that are only exclusive on my CD. And ask them too try something and they didn't like the beat. They said they're more into Southern beats. Well I gots look some more so I need an MC again but if you know someone have them contact me so I could have them flow to some beats and start my voice-over beat collection CD.

My First Mixtape: Track 5: My Favorite Ladies - MF Doom   I have this relationship with this girl Randee. We have been off and on on several occassions but lately haven't talked cause I don't like to speak to exes so much and she cheated on me the last time we were together. But this one it might be that I was with her so long that I've attached. But yesterday she say me and decide to talk to me and she asked why I never talk to her anymore. In a descritly tone of voice I told her that I had no reason to talk so why bother. She said she miss talking to me and she still likes me. But could I say well I chose to say nothing just put my head down. We talked about old times and specifically one time when we hid from her mom and auntie who didn't allow us to go out. Well we hid in this bush and we began to talk non-sense and I could see that we slowly were moving closer together. I should've moved in for the kiss but I stopped and said we better go. I don't know why I did that what was on my mind to not kiss her. I always use to regret like crazy my action. I told her that and she said that she wanted me to kiss her so bad. I felt I could kiss her again at that point but I didn't wanna ruin everything at that point. So I said my good byes went home and put on some danger mouse. I heard the phone ring and I answered it and it was her. I was so suprised cause she never called me. We talked for 2 hours and I let so much things out. We told each our feelings how we missed each other after everything had happened. She  told she regrets cheating on me anf I told her how I felt about her cheating on me. And she started to tell me sorry. But after those words we started talking about usaul stuff and I asked does your mom let you go on dates yet. She answered with well kinda and so I said," So if I said you wanna go watch a movie or hangout then you can answer with what you feel." "Yeah" she said. "OK then I just asked you" "Of course but when"she said. "How about like during the whole fiestas and that" "OK" I felt so relieved and happy with t
