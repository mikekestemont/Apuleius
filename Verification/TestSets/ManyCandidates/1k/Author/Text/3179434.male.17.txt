this is for friends of mine like...Brandon, and maybe David... I didn' t read it so I can't rate it, but I think they might like it, and so would you, and I promise, this is my LAST entry for today probably, if I don't go to sleep early that is...  1.  You refer to going to the bathroom as downloading.  2.  You step out of your room and realize that your parents have moved and you don't have a clue as to when it happened.  3.  Your bookmark takes 15 minutes to go from top to bottom.  4.  Your nightmares are in HTML and GIFS.  5.  You turn off your modem and get this awful empty feeling, like you just pulled the plug on a loved one.  6.  You start introducing yourself as "Jim at net dot com"  7.  Your heart races faster and beats irregularly each time you see a new WWW site address on TV.  8.  You turn on your intercom when leaving the room so you can hear if new e-mail arrives.  9.  Your wife drapes a blond wig over your monitor to remind you of what she looks like.  10.  All of your friends have an @ in their names.  11.  When looking at a web page full of someone else's links, you notice all of them are already highlighted in purple.  12.  Your dog has its own home page.  13.  You can't call your mother... She doesn't have a modem.  14.  You check your mail. It says "no new messages." So you check it again.  15.  Your phone bill is a heavy as a brick.  16.

You wake up at 3 a.m. to go to the bathroom and stop and check your e-mail on the way back to bed.  20.

This joke was...well let's see, it was totally meant for the kids that could think it up, and adults would find it to where they couldn't understand it... 4 out of 10   Be sure you lock your doors and windows at home.  It was reported in the news that a man was found murdered in his home over the weekend. Detectives at the scene found the man face down in his bath tub.  The tub had been filled with milk and corn flakes, and a banana was sticking out of his butt.  Police suspect a cereal killer.
I found another joke, this one made me almost cry laughing, since it was a little more disturbing than the other, I'd rate it a 9 out of 10:   Once upon a time, there was a guy sunbathing in the nude. He saw a little girl coming towards him, so he covered himself with the newspaper he was reading. The girl came up to him and asked "What do you have under the newspaper, mister?"  "A bird," the guy replied. The little girl walked away and the guy fell asleep.  When he woke up, he was in a hospital in tremendous pain. When the Police asked him what happened, the guy replied, "I don't know. I was lying on the beach, this girl asked me about my privates, and the next thing I know is I'm here."  Police went back to the beach, found the girl, and asked her "What did you do to that naked fellow?"  After a little pause, the girl replied, "To him? Nothing. I was playing with the bird and it spit on me, so I broke its neck, cracked its eggs, and set its nest on fire."
i thought I'd share something before I leave class, I find this DISTURBINGLY funny, so here you guys go:   A man was sitting on a plane reading a book.  A few minutes later he ran up to the pilot and said, "Help! Help! I dropped my favorite book out of the plane! Can you please stop it?"  "No, no, I am not stopping this plane for a book.", the pilot replied.  Later another man ran up to the pilot and asked, "Can please land the plane?  I dropped my lucky baseball."  "No, I will not land the plane for a baseball!!!"  A third man had dropped a gernade out of the plane.  He quick ran up the the pilot and started yelling, "Stop, stop, I lost my gern-"  "Alright, Alright!", he interupts.  "I will land the plane."  When the pilot got out he saw two little boys crying.  He asked them what was the matter, they replied something fell out of the sky and landed on them.  One was a book and the other a baseball.  A third boy came along and was laughing.  The pilot asked, "What are you laughing about?"  "I farted and my house blew up!"
