my mum really know me well. she actually know what i'm worrying about. n i just laughed. late afternoon my dad came back from work. my mum told him about it. as usual he will 'talk' to me and again, i laughed n tried to change topic. tml going out wif theo juan ping + wei sheng (theo's fren) haiz..duno1 2go or not..but i have been at hm for like a week? nv go to the town for the past one week or more ba...catching The Rose hope my mood can be better? at least for a while ba :)  ...back from watching The Rose...心情还是不好咧 真烦 给我一些宁静都不可以 我烦 我不出声 不想说话呀 你却一直在哪儿叽叽喳喳 你烦 我也烦呀 想怎样呀！一句：‘不要担心。。。’我就不烦了吗？ 好笑。说 得容易， 做起来很难 好不好！离开学的日子越来越近了，精神也越来越提不起来。。重新，全新的开始实在让我感到不安。。一直强颜欢笑，就是不想让他们担心 但还是被老妈猜到了， 真是的。我老妈她还真乐天咧，有时真佩服她那超乐天的个性。现在在听义达的‘显微镜下的爱情’超好听！不管是开始的抒情钢琴伴奏 或是 之后的摇滚发泄 都超赞！没有音乐的生命会像一口枯井。
i went Lot One NTUC foodfare to have lunch with my mum juz now. on my right side table, dere's 2 uncles, aged ard late 50s or early 60s ba. one of them have retired. (didn't mean to listen to their conversation) they were talking about going for a tour in beijing. CHINA - a place i wish i can visit :D at this point of time, i'm thinking, when am i able to go china, i don't wish to go after i have retire but who knows :p they have reached the age of retirement and i have not even step into the society. i'm still in the education stage. how will my future be? i have been asking myself this question for like..a few years? when will i have an answer? a satisfying answer? dream is dream. my dream future can't be reality so what's my real dream in this real world? in primary six, i study to score. sec one, i study because i do not want to lose out. sec two, i study so that i can promote to sec three? sec three, i study in order to do better. sec four, i study so that i can pass with fairly well results? now that i have received my o level results and waiting to enter SP BIT this course, why am i studying this course? why? i really wish to put SP multimedia tech as my 1st choice in the JAE form...but...tis course dun really provide the stuffs i wanna learn..like tins related to music producing etc etc..because my dream can't become reality...i can't fulfil my dream, can't make my dream become reality. i can't hear myself. Mayday 'Wu Zhuang' fill my room and me. music is my dream, a never ending dream, an endless dream. my future is in mist.
