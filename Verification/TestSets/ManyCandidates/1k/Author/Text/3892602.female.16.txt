Woot to the max.&nbsp; Ok, I am like sooooo tired (unlike our dear Hobbes), and    I HAVE A SLEEPOVER TO HOST TONIGHT!!! WAAAAH!!!    &nbsp;  Looks like I've got much caffeination to accomplish before the arrival hence.   Vacuum... Tea... Laundry...  Crap.   cheers    &nbsp;
The Scotsman    Well a Scotsman clad in kilt left a bar one evening fair  And one could tell by how he walked that he'd drunk more than his share  He fumbled round until he could no longer keep his feet  Then he stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street  Ring ding diddle diddle I de oh ring di diddly I oh  He stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street  About that time two young and lovely girls just happened by  And one says to the other with a twinkle in her eye  See yon sleeping Scotsman, so strong and handsome built  I wonder if it's true what they don't wear beneath the kilt  Ring ding diddle diddle I de oh ring di diddly I oh  I wonder if it's true what they don't wear beneath the kilt  They crept up on that sleeping Scotsman quiet as could be  Lifted up his kilt about an inch so they could see  And there behold for them to see, beneath his Scottish skirt  Was nothing more than God had graced him with upon his birth  Ring ding diddle diddle I de oh ring di diddly I oh  Was nothing more than God had graced him with upon his birth  They marveled for a moment, then one said we must be gone &nbsp;Let's leave a present for our friend, before we move along  As a gift they left a blue silk ribbon, tied into a bow  Around the bonnie star the Scots kilt did lift and show &nbsp;Ring ding diddle diddle I de oh ring di diddly I oh  Around the bonnie star the Scots kilt did lift and show  Now the Scotsman woke to nature's call and stumbled towards a tree  Behind a bush, he lifts his kilt and gawks at what he sees  And in a startled voice he says to what's before his eyes.  O lad I don't know where you been but I see you won first prize  Ring ding diddle diddle I de oh ring di diddly I oh  O lad I don't know where you been but I see you won first prize
You are ALTON BROWN, host of "Good Eats"! Geeky and quirky, a former indie film director turned foodie, you seek to put science to work for you in your kitchen.&nbsp; You concentrate on proper technique, and understanding why it works.&nbsp; You also take pride in using your clever wit to debunk popular (read: INCORRECT) thought about cooking.&nbsp; Youre just a little bit of a pedagogue, but thats cool, you know what the hell youre doing.
Please, oh please my good people,   urlLink click here . This is so bloody hilarious that I could not stop laughing the whole time!!!&nbsp; Now I happen to be a John Kerry supporter, but the digs at both him and Dubya were so outright hysterical that I couldn't keep from laughing my @$$ off the entire time!!!&nbsp; Kudos to JibJab for this lighthearted hilarity.  cheers, mates...
urlLink click it, baby    urlLink yes...and here...    If you dare... muahahahahahahaha!!!
A girl asked a guy if he thought she was pretty, he said...no.  She asked him if he would want to be with her forever....and he said no..  She then asked him if she were to leave would he cry, and once again he replied with a no.  She had heard enough.  As she walked away, tears streaming down her face the boy grabbed her arm and said....  You're not pretty you're beautiful.  I dont want to be with you forever. I NEED to be with you forever.  And I wouldnt cry if you walked away...I'd die...
urlLink now  > urlLink here   "I have come so that they may have life, and have it to the full."  That, friends, is my favorite Bible verse, as seen a la title of post.  Hmmm...what else to discuss???  Other stuff.  Fun.  Sleepover time tonight!! Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!  That done be fun.  ...rrr...laundry...  cheers;)   urlLink meow...
Just can't keep away.  Garsh, this thing is addictive.  I've been on here for like three hours, just adding ridiculous crap like this.    Hmmm...I like how people in the UK and Ireland (and is Scotland in the UK? Well, if not, Scotland too) call their friends "mate".  I think I should start that.  I always liked that.  Wish I had one of those British accents, too.  Not a stuffy one...like the accents the people on Virgin Radio have.  They're just cool.    (On the radio now: REM, "Losing My Religion."  Whatever happened to some good ol' fashioned Nirvana?  Did everyone forget about them?  Garsh, Foo Fighters weren't that spectacular, they just found a good drummer in Dave Grohl.)  You like that AB pic at the top? The one with the fish? Yeah, me too.  Heeeheeeheee...Good Eats cracks me up.  "Mr. Funion."    Oh! If perchance you are ever privy to viewing this page, Alton, I'm really sorry that you were so sick like that!  You were in my prayers from the first minute I found out.  I feel good too, man!  cheers
urlLink "Awww, it's a valentine. THAT WE'RE ABOUT TO STUFF FULL OF FISH!!!"   More in approximately three minutes.    (approximately three minutes later)  Well as you can see, I must be pretty, pretty bored if I am sitting down here on the computer, listening to British radio  yet again,  and   ORGANIZING THE FRICKING PICTURES IN MY PICTURES FOLDER! NOT PRINTING THEM OUT!  NOT MESSING WITH THEM IN PHOTOSHOP! ORGANIZING THEM INTO LITTLE FOLDERS WITH THEIR OWN STINKING LITTLE LABEL!!! GOD!!!    Welcome to the plethora of nothing happening in my evening.  Oh, British radio.  How I love thee.  'Scuse me for a sec.  urlLink YL  Thanxx for the patience.  Ahem...where was I?  Oh, yeah.  So anyway I'm like really getting down 'n dirty with the Christian life.  This is the best, but at the same t
