I do not have time.  It isn't me with the time LOL.  I wish I did but it seems my day is busy with kids and other things.  I do not sleep well at night so it makes the days that much harder.  I have been busy with the kids this week though so that is fun.  Monday I had to go pick up a new bus with 9 other drivers.  It was quite awesome driving down the highway there were 4 buses in front of me and 5 behind....really awesome sight.      The rest of the week has been playing with kids and having fun and by evening I am just tired and don't want to do anything LOL.  Tomorrow we will pack up the tents, air beds and other equipment and go camping for the weekend.  I will try to keep equipment down to a minimum.  Wish me luck LOL.      Things are not looking good for back to work.  There is a teacher's strike looming...we will find out by August 31st if we are even going back to work for the 7th or not.  That would be about all the whining I can fit in for now.  Not much else for good news.
What have I done?  hmmm funny thing is I don't remember this week much LOL.  I worked Sunday and got home at 1 am.  Sleep was short as I had to babysit in the morning.  Susan came back with Jordan.  Then we drove to Warkworth and back.  I had to go into work to get a uniform.  When we got home the kids went out to play and I just rested for a little while.      Tuesday, Susan had school in the morning.  I went out for some groceries after that and when Jordan and I got home I had a rest while she played video games.  Then out to get Susan and the kids went outside again for the afternoon.  I got more work Tuesday evening and didn't get in till almost 2 am.        Wednesday I went to pick Jordan and Susan up at 8:30 am and went to the school.  There was a parent information meeting.  I finally heard from Greg that day.  I was not happy with him.  They were in the northern part of Lake Couchiching (I think that is how you spell it LOL).  He hadn't thought about turning on his cell phone ever.  I had to go back to work that morning for something, can't remember what it was now but when Jordan and I got there, Michelle was there too so Jordan was happy to see her mom during the day.  We went to the zoo and spent 2.5 hours there.      Thursday, Susan was in school.  Jordan had hurt her neck so she was resting it.  We played video games all day!  I got a call from work they need me Saturday.      Now it is today LOL Friday.  The week is almost over.  I am still a bit tired and catching up.  Tomorrow I am taking a charter to the Blue Jays game, I am looking forward to it but still a bit nervous too.  I am sure I will do fine though.
I had a great day yesterday. I made an appearance at church. Some people missed me but not everyone. It was ok though not too bad. When I got home I took all the camping gear out of the van. Now I was hoping to not have to do that because it is a lot of work lifting the stuff up the stairs down the hall into the apartment. I had to take the quad seats out of Elizabeth's room after vacuuming all the cat hair off them. That job there took me an hour!       Then I rested for awhile, turns out I could have rested for another hour but we won't go there LOL. I had to drop Susan off with the sitter and then go to work. I got there and found out from my work sheets that my report time was 18:45 not 18:00 there is a big difference there. I checked my bus and took my time doing so but I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to get the axe unlatched.      Camp Moshava is camp strictly for Jewish kids and we took them to a roller rink in another city one hour and 15 min away. They were there for 1.5 hours. There was 7 bus loads go up. I went in the roller rink to check it out and I couldn't move from bodies everywhere LOL so I went back out and we went to Tim Hortons to hang out. I was done work about 01:00 and got in bed about 02:00.      Today I go pick up my neighbour in Warkworth. That is an hour drive but I don't have to be there till bout 09:45 so I have a bit of time to fill in...lol thus my blogging on my blog.      Nothing else is planned for today, perhaps I can sleep LOL.
A blogging we will go.  Today wasn't bad after all.  I did the Warkworth thing.  It was ok, I made good time coming back and went into work to sign the charter sheets.  After that I went to pick up Susan at Michelle's house.  We had coffee together and I hung out for about 1.5 hours.  Jordan asked if she could spend the night here so I brought her home with me.  They are watching tv now and I need to do something soon.  I have to do laundry yet too.      I spent 1 hour and 7 minutes on the phone with welfare, can we say boring?????  So, I was told that I would qualify for it and have to go for a 2 hour screening *eye roll* which now I am not sure I can attend.  There is so much paper work to get a hold of.  They want so much crap from me UGH.      I got a call from my friend Christie today and I phoned h
