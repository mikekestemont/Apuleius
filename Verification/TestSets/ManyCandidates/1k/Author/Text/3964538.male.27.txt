ok im like seriously freaking out right now and worried to holy hell...torri just signed on and i sent her a message then i got a responce back that this isnt torri...it was her best friend steven and siad he didnt know where torri was and that she wasnt answering her cell phone and that her brother was over there too he asked if i talked to her today which i hadnt and asked when i talked to her last... so needless to say i am thinking the worst right now and having a horrid feeling in my stomach...cause when i talked to her last nite she said she would be back in 30 to 45 mins and never came back...which is not like her... so of course all the worst possibilites are running thru my head right now and god i do not like this...im left sitting here feeling helpless...i told steven he has got me worried and to please let me know something but then he signed off.. god this sucks..im just hoping she went out drinking and got drunk and is just sleeping it off.. ok so i really cant type anymore cuase i just cant think straight and am too damn worried..so all i can do is sit here and hope and pray nothing is wrong..but the worst things wont leave my mind ok i gott go hopefuly i will hear something soon...
