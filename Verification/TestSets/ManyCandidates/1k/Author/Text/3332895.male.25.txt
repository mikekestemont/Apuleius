For about a week, I abandoned my regular  urlLink blog  to do a personal journal type of blog here. I found that the writing process here is much easier as there is no need to edit myself. My rants progress from general babble to long essays about nothing. I guess you could say that I had my first case of acute  urlLink blogorrhea .  Topics include boredom, death and the after-life, regrets, self-esteem, love and sex, pornography and my principles and philosophy in life or lack thereof. I was hoping that this would help enlighten me. Finding an outlet for whatever this is and at the same time, learn from this. After a week of writing, I became more confused than ever. Writing helps me solidify my thoughts and ideas into beliefs and principles. The more freely I wrote, the more I felt I had to edit. It felt as if I was writing this someone else. The fear of people judging the real me, I guess, is too overwhelming.  I wanted to keep the name of the blog, so I just deleted my posts. Thinking of what to do with this, I came up with the idea of a blog where I could place a list of my interests and hobbies. So another experiment ends and a new one begins...
Lately, I've been singing this tune:  I am extraordinary, if you'd ever get to know me I am extraordinary, I am just your ordinary Average every day sane psycho Supergoddess Average every day sane psycho My sister and I laugh whenever we get to the Supergoddess part. The lyrics is for the song "Extraordinary" by  urlLink Liz Phair . The video has been getting a lot of MTV airtime lately as it's included in Kate Hudson's new movie  urlLink Raising Helen .   I also like her song "Why Can't I":  Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you Why can't I speak whenever I talk about you It's inevitable, it's a fact that we're gonna get down to it So tell me Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you With songs like Extraordinary and Why Can't I included in her self-titled album, I think it's definetly worth downloading, I mean buying. =)
The  urlLink Matrix  is such a great film.  Reloaded and Revolutions were good but, in my opinion, weren't on the same level as the first movie. The Matrix had a lot of original elements, like the kung-fu stunts, visual effects and their story. After watching the movie, I pondered on the questions raised by Morpheus in the film.  Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that your were so sure was real?  What if you were unable to wake up from that dream, Neo? How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?   I wouldn't know how I would go about in answering that question.  Then, a friend introduced me to a book called  urlLink Sophie's World . He had read about it and  urlLink Philippine Daily Inquirer's  Editorial "Youngblood". The writer of the editorial graduated with a BS in Philosophy and was, I think, discussing the importance of Philosophy in our daily lives. Sophie's adventure starts when she suddenly receives questions in her mailbox:  Who are you? Where does the world come from? Her journey to answer those questions is what Sophie's World is all about. The book is a great read, part-story and part-textbook. And it's what got me interested in learning more about Philosophy.  As for the questions posed by Morpheus, I can try to answer that, but in another blog entry. =)
It's almost the end of the month.  About time to do some maintenance work on the PC. My "To-Do" list consists of:  1. Check for updates/patches 2. Upgrading firmware/drivers 3. Scan for spyware/adware 4. Scan for viruses 5. Defrag and optimize PC  There's a nifty little free program that helps me deal with my last task.   urlLink TuneXP  is a tool to automate several tweaks that help your computer run faster. It also defrags and rearranges your boot files to decrease your boot time. It also includes an easy to read documentation so that newbies like me can understand what the  urlLink tweak  does. Just select the tweaks you want to apply then restart your computer.  I had some issues using the system file checker. It asked for the WinXP installation disk  to verify the system files. After rebooting, my display had been wrecked. The system file checker must have installed an old vga driver, seeing that my driver wasnt XP certified. I just installed the nvidia driver, problem solved.  Links:  urlLink Bootvis  - Although  urlLink Microsoft  says otherwise, it's a tool to make WinXP boot faster.  urlLink Black Viper's Super Tweaks  - For those serious about tweaking WinXP.
