urlLink Television Without Pity   This is one of the best TV websites out there.  And I'm not saying that just because there are Canadians on staff.  Check out the recaps for "Joan of Arcadia."  Deborah is a goddess.
Well, I didn't make it for a run this morning.  I have been stressed out this weekend and couldn't sleep last night, so I let myself sleep in.  I tried to go to a step class at lunch, but was so stressed that I started to have a panic attack.    I have learned lately that exercise does help me stress, but when I'm starting to breakdown it does not help.  I left the class and went to visit a friend at a nearby office.  I have not given up on running.  I will try again tomorrow.    Money is the main cause of my stress.   I work a boring office job, where I am well liked and therefore make the average salary.  This however is not enough to be comfortable in Toronto on my own, when I owe $30 000 in student loans.  I have $2000 charged on my Visa and I want to visit my parents in the Fall.  They live in another part of the country and are not able to help me financially.  My immediate goal is to pay off my Visa debts and not max it out again.  I would like to at least buy my plane ticket in cash.  I've given my Visa cards (there are 2, each with a thousand dollar limit) to my best friend.  She is hiding them in her underwear drawer at home until I show her statements with zero balances.  To be able to pay them with just my present income would take a year or more, and it's even harder when I keep sneaking small purchases onto them.  So, I've decided to look for part-time work.
I started reading blogs a few months ago.  I check 4 of them almost daily and have been inspired to start one of my own.  I hope that by keeping a blog I will stick with running.  I have been running on and off for almost 10 years now.  A few times in high school I would decide that I need to lose weight, be healthier, or just get a hobby.  So I would try running.  It would only last for a few weeks, then I would quit.  Last October I joined a running group and stuck with it for 4 months, but I'm back to square one now.   Yesterday morning I dragged my bottom out of bed and went for a "run."  I was able to run a minute at a time, with one minute walking in between, 7 times.  It was a sunny, cool morning.    Tomorrow morning, before work, I will run.
I'm taking Friday off of work to make it a four-day weekend.  It sucks that Canada Day is on a Thursday this year, but now that I'm off Friday I don't care.    I have a list of things I want to do this weekend:  Month-end laundry  - all my sheets and towels that have built up over the month  Crochetting  - finish the purple mittens for me, start Mum's Christmas present, maybe play with a few swatches  Blog some stuff I've been hanging on to   RELAX!
This is the post I put on the  urlLink Cool Running  forum earlier.  I'm back baby!   1.) What week/day are you on?  W3D1  2.) Are you repeating a week?  This is my second time doing W3.  I finished it a week ago, but I got sick and wasn't able to move on to W4 right away.  I was barely able to get the energy to get out of bed to feed the cat so running was out of the question.  I'm feeling a lot better now and I've decided to repeat W3 and start W4 strong.  3.) How do you feel?  Since I hadn't run in 9 days and I'm still a newbie I figured today would be horrible.  I was paranoid that I'd have to go back to W2.  Luckily, I made it through today's run.  4.) Will you move on next week?  Yes  5.) Tell us your thoughts.  I'm just happy to be running.  6.) Are you taking extra time off to recover?   No, I'm not even that sore after the runs yet.
Finally, weeks of listening to the politicians pick on each other.  Soon the government of Canada will have a new make up - all the new and returning MPs will head to Parliament, to pick on each other. I don't like the Canadian government.  I don't like the provincial government (Ontario or Nova Scotia.)  But I do vote.  There is no way that I'm not going to have my say.  I won't let others speak for me.  **I can't let Stephen Harper be our next PM.  If he got in and I didn't vote, I'd have to emigrate.  I couldn't complain about him and admit that I didn't do my part to try and keep him out of power.**   Issues that are important to me:   Health care  - free national health care is great.  Taxing the crap out of us for it sucks (Dalton McGuinty - I'm talking to you.  How dare you take $25 dollars a month more from me - I just get by as it is.  Don't you make enough off the interest I pay on student loans?)  Our health care is part of what makes Canada great.  It's lacking dental care.  Teeth are an important part of overall health.  I've never understood why it's not subsidized like other health services.  And we need more rural doctors.  I lived most of my life in NS without a primary care physician.   Education  - tuition in Canada is too high, and financial aid is not the answer.  I have a degree, and poor parents, therefore I have $30 000 in student loans to pay back.  Education makes our country better, but debt is making me consider (seriously) leaving the country.  If I'm going to be b
