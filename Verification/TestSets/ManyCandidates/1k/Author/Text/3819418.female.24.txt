i don't know of anyone else who actually knows and recognizes their half birthdays... well, for one more hour or so, today is my half birthday... how fun is that???&nbsp;   for those who don't know - i am living with this absolutely terrific family for the summer and it is mostly chaos, but lots of fun... there are 9 of us who live here altogether - "mom and dad," 5 "brothers" and one "sister" and me- the kids' ages range from 7-24.5 (that's me)... and 3 dogs, 2 guinea pigs, a bunny, fish and 5 birds... yeah, it's definitely a full house...  tonight they were having a war with air soft pistols in the house... crazy - i was just trying not to get shot...&nbsp;it's so fun... i will be sad to go back to not living with a bunch of people, i think... even though some quiet time alone will be good - and i can always come visit...  it really just makes me feel happy to be surrounded with people... for all 9 of us to sit around the dinner table together and share lives...&nbsp; what a wonderful concept of family that God designed...   so there's my random bit o'stuff for the day... i hope the weekend is terrific for you!!!
so today i went on an interview with a small company here in vancouver... i left feeling really good about it and the more i thought about it, the less good i felt.  i'm really unsure about what to do, job-wise, but one thing i've decided is i need to have a better attitude about work.&nbsp; i know that God has me in the job He has me in for a reason... i was thinking back to my friend amy's job last year and how much&nbsp;she struggled, but what she learned... and i know that i will learn more if my attitude is better.&nbsp;   so prayers would be appreciated about my job situation.&nbsp; during the interview today he asked me what my plans were for the next year, 2 years and 5 years and i almost laughed in his face... i know what i'm doing for the next five days, and if you gave me enough time, i might be able to come up with what i'm doing for the next five weeks... other than school i have NO IDEA!!!&nbsp;   so anyway... we'll see what happens...   movie quote of the day... (by the way, TONS OF POINTS still available - maybe i should get a job at a movie store) worth 1000 points... it's a tough one - but there's&nbsp;a hint with the character name... no cheating!!!   urlLink Gib : I flunk English, I'm outta here. I gotta get a job, and you know what that means. That's right, they start me at the drive-up window and I gradually work my way up from shakes to burgers, and then one day my lucky break comes: the french fry guy dies and they offer me the job. But the day I'm supposed to start some men come by in a black Lincoln Continental and tell me I can make a quick 300 just for driving a van back from Mexico. When I get out of jail I'm 36 years old. Living in a flop house. No job. No home. No upward mobility. Very few teeth. And then one day they find me, face down in the gutter, clutching a bottle of paint thinner and why? Because you wouldn't help me in English.
i went to see a very stupid movie tonight... okay, it's not stupid, but i made a poor choice in going to see it... within the first five minutes, i was crying... what the heck???   i love movies... i like watching all sorts of movies about many different things... action, suspense, rom-com, comedy, drama, an occasional sci-fi... it doesn't much matter... love most... however... sometimes, especially when i'm feeling as vulnerable as i am today, it makes it NO FUN to go see a movie and have no control over the power it has over me... even thinking about the things that the scenes in this particular film made me think and feel, i am almost to tears... but not almost... i am there...   so i guess i just felt like venting, although my journal will receive more details than any of you will get... i don't even think i'll write the name of the movie... mostly to spare myself the embarrassment that would surely come!!!&nbsp; and i guess this entry has little point other than my frustrations as a female...&nbsp; sorry guys...
i have two really really good ones... but i'll save them for last!!!   1.&nbsp; i got to sleep in and don't have to work, which gives me a little rest time which is way good!!!   2.&nbsp; it's another beautiful day in vancouver...  urlLink  &nbsp;  3.&nbsp; praise team practice is tonight and i like praise team practice a lot!!!  4.&nbsp; i finished my last summer school assignment, so i'm officially free from school stuff until august 23rd...   5.&nbsp;&nbsp;the arkansas state university football team (go indians!!!)&nbsp;is playing the&nbsp;university of idaho football team&nbsp;(boo vandals!!!) at idaho this year (on nov. 6), which is&nbsp;only 6 hours away from where i live so&nbsp;i might be able to&nbsp;go watch my team play football this year!!!&nbsp; i just&nbsp;need to find some friends to go with me!!! &nbsp; urlLink http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/teamsched?teamId=2032   i'm sure there will be at least five more things today - but that is what i have for now... any takers on asu football in idaho, let me know!!!
i know i still haven't written many details about camp - but the theme of camp is "totally consumed."&nbsp; i was challenged by the director to look at hebrews 12:2-29, as the passage talks about God being a consuming fire...  &nbsp; well, to me, i've always found comfort in God being a consuming fire.&nbsp; i've probably never thought about it completely.&nbsp; i figured it's good to be totally consumed in God and that's the way i thought about it.&nbsp; so, today, i thought i should p
