Well my week's vacation from school is over and am excited to go back on monday for the summer quarter.  I found out my grades for the spring quarter, and am soooooooo happy that I got on the President's List again (GPA 3.75 to 4.0) I got an "A" in English Composition I - "A" in Medical Terminology - "A" in Keyboarding (class was to easy) - "B" in Anatomy & Physiology I. But I have to admit I was a little upset about my A&P grade as I was only one point away from an "A" :(  I couldn't believe it, just one little stinkin point LOL :)  Oh well! So that put my GPA at 3.75, but in the winter quarter my GPA was 4.0, so combine the two GPA's and I am sitting at 3.87 (YYYEAAHHH).   My new classes for the summer quarter are:  Computer Applications Medical Law & Ethics/Therapuetic Communications Anatomy & Pathophysiology II English Composition II  Over my weeks break from school my husband and I went down memory lane and took a trip to our home (we call home of where we first met 11 years ago) to Copperas Cove/Killeen/Fort Hood. Oh! how I missed the place and didn't want to come back. Alot has changed since we were there, but in about 5 years we will permenately retire there for good :)  The only things that sucks is, they don't have medical assistant jobs :( They only have LVN or RN jobs. The town is small and a little behind the time with big cities, as when we went there for the 4th of July weekend, they had just took into effect the no smoking policy in buildings (if that gives you an idea how slow the town is LOL ) Copperas Cove is the town we want to live at and right now it's popluation is only 29,533. The place is perfect for us with how beautiful the scenic nature is with the beautiful mountains, lush green trees and grass, lakes, and most of all the wonderful temperatures at night and during day verses here in the DFW area :) So guess I will wait and see how the job hunting will go once we move there :)  I would like to Thank the Medical-Assistants yahoo group for sharing this wonderful site. I don't post much there as so busy with studying, taking care of 3 kids, house, etc... that this is a whole lot easier for me to do for all to see what is happening with me and also for all my other family and friends to know too :)  Thank You!!  Til next time!
Tonight is the first night of starting my new set of summer quarter classes, and I am a bit excited.  Tonights class is computer applications and it is a five hour class (yuck on the hours) but am excited to learn all the microsoft application programs.  I just wonder how long am I gonna have to wait to get my book. On the first night of each new semester, you have to wait til the book keeper comes to the class to say we can get our book. I hate doing it that way and wish the school would do it like they have mentioned to me, is that they are trying to let us old students get our books before the quarter is out, so all they have to do is give out the books for the new students, but that will never happen.  I wish I could get my two other books tonight, but know they won't let me. I will be using my A&P books again and my English Composition books again so that saves me bookshelf room LOL :) The only other two books I will be getting is Medical Law & Ethics and Therapuetic Communications. I am anxious to start all of the new classes and see how it goes. The only thing I am wondering is what Instructors am I getting and how are they.  Will post tomorrow of how my first night of class went and for each new class this week :)    Til next time!
Well I know I said I would post everyday about my new classes, but got so busy I forgot.  Monday night I had Computer Applications and it came with a really BIG book. The class was easy and think this class will be easy for me, let alone fun :)  Right now we are doing Microsoft Word (which I already know).  The instructor seems to be a pretty good person and funny.  Tuesday night I had Medical Law & Ethics/Therapuetic Communications. That night we went over Medical Law. This instructor is new and he is a pretty good guy. He was an officier in the Army with an MOS of 91 Bravo (civilian terms EMT). He still carries the military attitude towards keeping the class quiet and trys to crunch everything in, in one night (which that for me got a little overwhelming, but did manage to finish what he wanted done). Next week he wants to go over Therapuetic Communications. Now that book I am interested in, as he wants us to read the first chapter which I did. I skimmed through the book and this book is going to be fun for me at least :)  For the medical law part, he wants us to find an article every week either online or in newspapters etc, and write a one page summary. So I need to start doing a search for articles of that nature online. He also mentioned that if we wear our scrubs every week, he will give us 3 points and we can use that towards our mid term or final exam.  Last night was Anatomy and Pathophysiology II. This teacher is gonna be a tough one for me (here my luck with good teachers was doing good so far the whole time in school LOL). But we didn't get to stay long, as the air conditioner was out i
