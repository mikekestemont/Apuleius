Veggie burgers are, that is.  I should've figured that rubbery brown patties interspersed with bursts of corn (?) would taste like feet.  Anders and I took a little trippie poo to my version of food utopia in the new Time Warner Center - Whole Foods - last night for some sustenance, and I decided to try something that wasn't a) a footlong stick of pepperoni or b) a Hot Pocket (yes, those have been whole meals for me in the recent past).  Lesson learned: if it looks like feet, it will taste like feet.  Also be forewarned: MetRx energy bars taste like packaged butt.    Have a wonderful Memorial Day weekend everyone!  P.S. By the way, my darling friends, you are all at risk of being mentioned in my blogs (purely in an appropriate manner, of course), AND I have the ability to upload pictorials! MUWHAHAHAHAHAHA.....
I had never heard of a "blog" before, until I visited the site of the girl who had my current position before me.  At last, an outlet for my wanton, random musings!  This site will allow me to ruminate all I want without clogging your inbox.  If you have some down time, you can log onto my site to watch my inner dialogue unfold on screen.  Though, I realize that this might result in the loss of, oh, all of my friends, as you all realize that I have a propensity to insert "partially shaved badger on crack" into normal conversation.  In the interest of short attention spans, I will keep all of my blogs brief.  But be forewarned: you may uncover a lot of deep-seated rage towards my morning commute and a LOT of disturbing references to partially shaved badgers on crack..........
I only say this because my legs are en fuego today. I am trying to prepare for my baby 5K race at the end of June (In the midst of people I know training for triathlons, this is big for me. For me to run 50 meters without my head exploding is a gigantic feat).  As I was hobbling along the lower loop of Central Park last night, I became aware of old men with canes, babies and blind people passing me with alarming frequency.  Seriously.  Is everyone taking steroids nowadays and eating those packaged energy butt bars (see post from May 28th) or am I just supremely out of shape?  I need to find more pleasurable methods to not balloon (given my propensity to eat mass quantities of meat products in one sitting).  But given my lack of athletic ability (flashback to grade school where I was generally the last to be picked for sports.  Tetherball, for god's sakes), the only two activities that I would be suited for are a spirited game of Connect Four or flossing.    As an aside, the movie, "Dodgeball," coming to theaters soon only serves to remind me how cruel grade school can be.  It was bad enough that I attended Catholic school with the  urlLink Children of the Corn  (Literally.  Mean little bastards), but to give those vile trolls a large, hard ball with which to hurl with all their might at scrawny, unathletic classmates is unspeakable.  Why don't we just hand out a stick to all the kids to beat each other with?  Have a fantabulous weekend!
It's happening.  Upon moving to the city, I had heard tales that "New York City hardens people and makes them meaner."  Fresh-faced and wide-eyed, this Arkansas girl had vowed that she would remain friendly and be the  urlLink Guy Smiley  to my fellow city dwellers.  Five years and an attempted eviction by one of Satan's minions in the guise of a 70-year old Belgian woman who lived underneath me later, I am forced to admit that I am meaner.  I elbowed a guy in his white linen-clad ribs this morning who barreled into me at the subway turnstile.  I am finding it hard to refrain from kicking a pigeon in front of a bus (Those damn rats with wings - I could devote an entire blog highlighting why they should be eradicated).  I am developing a permanent scowl on my face and directing it towards men, women, children and Salvation Army Santas ringing bells for the poor.  Stupid poor.  In other news: good god, what is wrong with people?  urlLink Seriously...   urlLink I mean, come on...   Speaking of Sesame Street, was it just me or did anyone find it odd that NO ONE ever noticed  urlLink Snuffleupagus ?  I was 3 years old and even I was screaming at the TV, "Hel-LO!  Does anyone not notice the 7-foot tall brown wooly mammoth behind the Kleenex box?  Are you friggin' BLIND??"  As I re-read my blog, perhaps I have some anger management issues...
A throwback from the Canadian rapper Snow's "Informer."  To my extreme surprise and horror, this song was one of 50 on the new VH1 show "Awesomely Bad Songs."  He is white, he has dreads, he raps.  What more could you want?  I spent my weekend debating the existence of the Sasquatch, the merits of Color Me Badd (with 2 "D's") and discovering www.weatherunderground.com (apparently, the Weather Channel is SO 1990's) during a college pal gathering at our friend Seth's abode at the Outer Banks, NC.  It was great to hang around old friends as strange as myself.  The only downside: 6 hot dogs should not be eaten in one sitting.    As an aside, if you are easily frightened by horror movies, do not watch "The Ring." I nearly crapped my pantaloons.   I leave you with a  urlLink tragic tale .  My weird friends, you rock.
In honor of the late Ronald Reagan, I am paying my respects by not coming into work today, hence no blog (my company closed its offices today - I am really not that lazy).  Have a good weekend - thanks for your continued support.
I was watching that VH1 show above yesterday evening before finishing the Sunday NY Times crossword in pen and beginning my private Swahili lesson (lest you think that I primarily sit drooling i
