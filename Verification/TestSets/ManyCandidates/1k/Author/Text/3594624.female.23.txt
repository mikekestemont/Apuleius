No i didn't take part. i don't look like an aquathon-er anyway do i? Lilian and me went to blade, yes.. we went to blade when there's a freakin aquathon on the same day. But we didn't know! Too late.. we were already there right? so might as well go and check out the place.. maybe not the whole beach closed ma, being ever the hopefuls we are.  So we decided to chuck all our stuff, blades included into the lockers and trek down the beach to see where is blocked for the run, with camera in hand. Our first photo of the day..    urlLink     and then we went further down to the NZ ice cream/sakae sushi/billabong beachfront area.. quite nice and quiet now coz not totally ready, only NZ ice cream and billabong open   urlLink      urlLink     We realised the road is not closed lor, the marshalls anyhow say.. people still cycling and walking and pushing prams yes BABY PRAMS. But we still walk la coz wanted to go to 7-eleven. Then we saw a handsome! haha never take picture la. so paisay. So we walk walk 2 more mins and decided to turn back and take our blades (not because of the guy hor, because we wanted to blade and by now we walk very far already)  Then we FINALLY started blading. We very fit yesterday also.. we walk up and down then still blade from siloso to tanjong beach and back TWICE ley and in between still from dolphin lagoon go back tanjong another time. Then we stopped at 7-e on the way back and carry our blades and walk back.. like carrying two weights.. good la..tone my arms sial..and really today i weigh myself lose 1 kg! Must do this every week already got motivation haha. And we saw handsome 2 more times while blading woo! Funny thing is..i dreamt of him last nite..with 2 dark kids..pushing them on a trolley no less! me and my silly dreams haha!  Then because of the aquathon right..millions of ppl..and u know girls take millions of years to bathe and beautify themselves right..the bathing queue was damn long lor! so we went to lie on the beach and nua a bit (almost fall asleep haha) then bathe. nua finish also still got queue! so we went to eat.. at TRAPIZZA!    urlLink     Our yummy inferno pizza :) with thin crust! my fav   urlLink     Ya i know i eat pizza very unglam la..thats y i always use fork and knife!   urlLink     Especially when u look at the next picture..lilian eat pizza with hands still can look nice    urlLink     In the end hor.. i did something i NEVER thought i would do. We never bathe. gross right? After we blade and walk and lie on the sand somemore. But bo bian! after we finished eating the queue is STILL long lor, if we waited..9+ still in sentosa.   You would think we go home straight and bathe right? Get ourselves clean..but no..we actually went to the MANGO sale! at Orchard somemore! haha.. and tried on clothes (horror!) but i bought 2 out of 3 pieces i tried hor. But you see..that's why i ALWAYS wash new clothes before i wear them  MOS strawberries to reward ourselves after our "fit" day!   I love this picture! haha! sorry lilian!   urlLink     ****  Later that nite we went to the airport to fetch David.. at 235am. There was this FREAKIN IRRITATING ANG MOH at the arrival hall walking around with his girlfriend shouting his bloody head off. "WHERE ARE THE LOCKERS? LOOOCCCKKK-KKERRRSSS. Oh i don't think they understand simple english.. LOCCCCKKKERRRSSS CAN ANYONE TELL ME WHERE ARE THE LOCKERS????"  wah lao. damn irritating lor. Who the hell knows where he put his freakin luggage!! then he shouted loudly "SINGAPORE IS SHIT" like 3 times and then he and the girlfriend disappeared. He just bulldozed through everyone shouting like a madman! I should have taken a picture and sent it to the Newpaper, and maybe can win handphone somemore. I feel so embarrassed for his girlfriend. If i had a boyfriend like that i'd smack him upside down already.
Didn't go swimming after all, postpone to next week. Instead i went out with Deb and Lil to nua and walk around.. what else is there to do in Singapore right? Squeezed in a little shopping, OP got 20% storewide..so i bought this cute little pink bag :)      urlLink      Happens that the stuff i like lately are all pink... happy coincidence?   So after hanging around Raffles city and Citylink for a while..(we're there every week cos church is just next door) we decided to go to the Esplanade to take some nice pictures.. and we came across this     urlLink       Some sorta art display.. a window display full of cotton.. seems like anything and everything is called ART these days.. interesting nevertheless.. Deb starting talking about playing in the cotton box like those "ball rooms" we use to jump about in when we were kids. Err.. i can only imagine the cotton in your mouth.  We hung around Marina park a bit trying to catch some dragonboat action.. unfortunately (didn't get to see any tall tanned hunks. boo!)..or fortunately (weather's too damn hot. can't do w/o AIRCON la)..whichever way u look at it.. we didn't.. Instead we rushed to catch the bus down to Harbourfront to meet Lilian.. and began nua-ing in AIR CON comfort (What else did u expect?)  We basically just parked ourselves on the armchairs at Mac's and took photos and did some synchronised glaring back at ppl who dared stare at us haha     urlLink      Guess who's who.. too dark right..and i can't lighten the photo..it just ends up getting orangey no matter what i do    urlLink        urlLink      Trying to see how big we can open our eyes.. but the only thing we succeed in doing is making our eyebags look bigger! Gosh.. it's a losing battle to get rid of them!  Notice how the photos have a nice cosy feel to them? (Actually i off the flash coz i
