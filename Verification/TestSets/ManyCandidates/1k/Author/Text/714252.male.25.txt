HeHe.. Was out last night.. Ouch.. My head HURTS..  I went out with my little brother first.. We went to see spider-man (my second time. his first) with my little sister! Wh0ot!  Then me and sis went to The Capital for a drink. Bubbles turned up after getting his first pay check and (literaly) forced drink into us.. GAH.. I had shots and tequila beer (I'd never heard of it before either) and normal beer and all kindsa things.. Next thing I know we are in The Pod dancing to da funky hip hop sounds..  Did I mention my head hurts now?  WELL IT DOES
After much debating with myself I have decided to improve the ASP engine for The .Bar.. I am going to add a User registration so people can edit their own posts and a couple of other nifty features, so please be nice to me if the site goes funky every now and again ;)
HeHe.. This whole site idea is working out great :)  I haven't had this much fun in AGES ;) Have just added Bubbles to the people section.. read his posts at your peril (and I REALLY mean that..) and have stuck some pictures up too.. Wh0ot!
LOL... My friend Sheila has to be the WORST web user I have ever met.. She can't find a home link when it is right on the page!  Maybe it's just me.. Do you find the site reasonably easy to navigate? If you don't..  urlLink Mail me !
Phew.. Much more in control of myself than i was in the wee hours last night.. got no calls about that awfull site I have been workin on so I am a happy camper today..  The weather is lovely outside and I am in a great mood (for a change)  Life is good
Phew.. It's 1:57AM here and I am EXHAUSTED but at least I got all my work finished..  Been working on a major customer for a few days and it has been driving me MAD trying to get the site closed.. Still have a few pieces to do but everything that is left is on their side now..  On site tomorrow and then I think I might see if I can organise a long weekend sometime soon.. (although I may just wait till the end of July.. I have my yearly week off for my Birthday then! 28/07 if anyone happens to be reading and caring at the same time ;P)  I think I have done all the tweaking I am going to do on the main site (for now) and I have to say I am really pleased with the way it turned out.. doesn't integrate the best with the blogs, but tbh I think I may just write my own blog engine if the site warrants it.. I don't think it will tho and this does fine for me :)  If you haven't seen Jonnys tribute page (created by a long time fan of my flatmate Jonny) then go to The .Bar main site and check out the links section.. FUNNEH!  K, going to bed now.. need sleep.. up in 5.30 hours.. must be mad.. actually, know I am mad, I am sitting here wibbling on at 2.02AM when I could be in bed sleeping already...  Stop typing Michael  DISCONNECT  It's only da Interweb.. Let it go.. GO TO BED...  heh.. Mad? Me?
HeHe, Finally got the Main Bar site finished structure wise, just need to get the content in and add another few pages and we are ready to go live!  Yeay me! ;)
Welcome to my Blog.. As with most things I will probably post rampantly to this thing for the next month then completely forget that I have it ;)   By the way, most of my posts will be done through a haze of alcohol.. please feel free to ignore everything I say..
Lo Lo Lo.. The Net has been going like pig in shite today so this is the first time I have been able to log in to update my Blog..  Jonny still rocks (go read his last two posts.. He needs the validation ;P)  Karl still Blows (Mister I update my site everyday has dropped off the planet!)  Bubbles still takes it.. What you expect more text? He does exactly what it says on the tin :D  ANYWHO, going to go into town to get my Witness tickets tonight while I still can!  K, that'll have to do you till later  Go away now
Lo Lo Lo..  Have been too tired to update so :P  I would just like to take this oportunity to say what a great guy Jonny is and I think everyone should send him money for no reason.. You will feel better for it.. (God Damn Blackmail.. Have to get something on him for a change)  On a lighter note Karl and Bubbles have nothing (literaly) so I can happily tell everyone that Karl is a big Gay puff and Bubbles is his skanky ass cracker bitch :) Ahhhhhh that felt better  To summerize, Jonny rocks, Karl Blows, Bubbles takes it..
Just read  urlLink Jonny's Blog  and just thought I would say that I heartily endorse his product and\or service and would recomend everyone else to try it.. I sent him 500 Euros and Within 24 Days I recieved 25,000,000 Euros!!!  *whispers to jonny, I am getting 25%. yeah?*   Also please note, Karl is a big girls blouse.. That is all :)
Was just looking at  urlLink Karl's damp little corner  and I noticed him dissing our l337 bl0g1ng sk1llz ;)  Yes Karl you can get (and WILL need) a lock for your sleeping bag :)  I was in bits yesterday.. Was out on Sunday night (and how ;]) and only get 2 hours sleep so spent yesterday in a zombie like state.. Then got home and had a few drinks at The .Bar (No, I don't have a problem.. If there was no drink in the fridge\bar THEN I'd have a problem)  I have to say it is great having a fully stocked b
