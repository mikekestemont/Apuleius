Week of: &nbsp; July 25th       urlLink Wanderjive    mister_meh    urlLink      This is a great dark pulp-noir comic that has such style and sophistication, it's hard to believe it's actually free. It's not just the art itself that creates this excellent comic, it's also the juxtaposition of music (via truncated downloadable MP3s) that combined together with the visual comic style create an almost movie-like experience. It's unique, all-encompassing, and fantastic. And it can only be done on the internet.  It's made the Evil Network Comics listing now! Great stuff!

Feel free to offer up suggestions for comics you'd like to see added to the big list. We're going to be a bit more selective this time around, but we're still open to the possiblity. In any case, each suggestion will at the very least be investigated for quality.  Suggestions can be  urlLink emailed , or you can leave a  urlLink comment on the list .
Just added a new 'Evil Network Site' to my Blogger collection on the right -hand navigation menu.  urlLink Evil Network Games  is now open with all sorts of links to sites of infinite gaming goodness. Much like  urlLink Evil Network Comics , the  urlLink Games  blog will be updated periodically with new links as more become available that I've missed. As always, please feel free to post comments to the lists with new links and corrections.
Can anyone please explain  urlLink this  to me?  "OK, so yeah, we're Interplay, and we have no money, nothing but bad press, and we'll be non-existent by July 2004, but would you please invest in our new MMORPG game? I know the current market is saturated with the genre, but we have a  really good feeling  about this one."  I doubt Herve Caen could count to 10 without cheating somehow. He just seems like he has something to hide. I hate to say it, but I can't wait for them to tank. Then maybe investors will grow wise to the fact that you just don't put Caen in charge of  anything .  Gaming news is a bit dry right now, with E3 excitement over and everyone being extraordinarily tight-lipped regarding new games and next-generation technology. Although I was able to dig up  urlLink this nugget of goodness . A  Golden Sun  game for the Cube is supposedly in development. I was a big fan of the first GBA game, but never had the time for  Lost Age . It's good to see all these excellent GBA games get their turn on the Cube. I hope Nintendo keeps encouraging that of its developers and partners.  Well, the time has come. After almost a solid month of no gaming, I'm going to attempt to play  Halo  this weekend. My friend invited a new couple from our church over to his house this weekend, and he's getting a bunch of us together for another  Halo  team deathmatch session. Evidently, the lady is quite the  Halo  player. Actually, I believe the term my friend said she used was  Halo Queen . We'll see. Last time I gamed  Halo   (about 2 days prior to crushing my hand) , I played very well. Better than I ever had previously. Let's see if I've lost any of that ability.  Note that I've added links on the right hand side to a couple other blogs I shall attempt to maintain, including a resurrection of my old  urlLink online comics listing . This one will be much more sparse, as I will be very seletive this go-round, and I won't just be adding everything to the list. Only the good stuff gets in this time. People will be able to leave comments on items in the list. Feel free to suggest some more comics, and I'm happy to check them out. Hopefully this list will be much easier to maintain. We'll see.  That's all for now. Later, kids...
Just wanted to use this space today to say  happy birthday  to my wife. She's 25 today! That makes her a quarter of a century old, and now able to rent a car in most states. :)    Happy birthday, sweetie!
Thanks for waiting around. I've been on hiatus for a couple of reasons. One: I got sick of Tripod throwing worthless crap on their free sites and referring to them oh so cleverly as 'added features'. Two: I broke m
