This past week was seasoned with the intermittent fear that I might be called to jury duty. For some reason or another, I have never been asked to jump in the pool and this was my first time to the courthouse downtown. At 7:45am, the courthouse hall was packed with potential jurors. They corral all of us into a room with a lectern and television monitors. A couple of sweet ladies and a retired judge explain the system and the procedure along with some industrial films extolling the virtues of our civic duty. My favorite was the talking head who stated proudly that he and his fellow jurors have stayed in touch through the ages and do fun things together socially. From the vibe I was getting in the room, I didn't quite think that I was going to be making life long friends. To be sure, every one had books, organizers, notepads, palm pilots, and cell phones - various and sundry things to while away the time. Noon comes around and we are released to our lunch break.  I discovered that you can get a lot done in one and a half hours down at the Civic Center. I visited the new cathedral, Olvera Street, and managed to wolf down some substandard Japanese food off some steam table. Around 1:35pm, one panel is called out and the room becomes alert and full of bristled hair and good pimples. Mercifully, my name is passed on. And back to my reading. If there is anything good about jury duty, I get to catch up on my summer reading like it's nobody's business and I continue to plow through this Bill Wilson autobiography I have been picking at since March. The PA system goes on again at 3:40pm. They are familiar words asking if every one that is out in the hall can please come back to the main room. Again, the room's energy spikes, but this time with an incredulous hue. I think, there's no way in hell that they are going to call a panel at 3:40, as we are to be released somewhere between four and five. The voice announces that we are indeed being let out early. The crowd hoots and howls and claps and hi-fives. It's as if the Laker's won the championship again. Which leads me to wonder. Jury of my peers. So, if I ever get sued for some reason or another (and this is not wishful thinking), does that mean that the jury selected would be composed of a group of people who don't want to be there at all? That would love nothing better than to be anywhere else?   "It is the spirit and not the form of law that keeps justice alive." - Earl Warren  Can I get a witness?
So, my friend and I went to go see a documentary called "The Gift" last night. http://www.thegiftdocumentary.com/ At it's center, it chronicles the stories of two young men who consciously seek to get infected with HIV. One is completely regretful with his choice, while the other one appears to be glassy-eyed, if not somewhat satisfied that he reached his goal. The film encompassed so much more than these two tales though. They interviewed doctors, long term HIV survivors, and many others to give a pretty well rounded discourse about why we as a community are still finding the HIV rates going up. After the screening was over, there was a panel discussion with the director and a few other "experts". The one panelist who really impressed me was Mark Thompson. I've done some research and he was written a number of books such as "Gay Spirit", "Gay Soul", and "Gay Body" which I am going to ad to my ever increasing list of summer reading. The director stated that she feels that the problem at hand is two fold: first, the prevention campaigns are not effective. She used the analogy of that devastating television ad where a woman smokes a cigarette through a hole in her throat. On the flip side, we have HIV drugs and prevention ads with buffed-out mountain climbers, rich and healthy Magic Johnson, and a Hep-C campaign that lists all of the horrific symptoms that can transpire over a set of washboard abs. Even this new Crystal=HIV campaign that is all over NYC right now has the image of a circuit boy and a mirror ball. What none of the current campaigns seems to do effectively is associate HIV with illness and death. Point well taken. Secondly, she stated that she felt that we were in the midst of a "spiritual crisis". That view leads right into the masterful words that Mr. Thompson spoke of last night. He really feels that the root cause of the issue is the huge level of self-loathing that the gay community experiences and expresses today: that it comes from our larger society that does not accept or appreciate us and that we take that in and perpetuate it within our own. To take a more positive spin on this view, what we need is more self-love. He posed the question, "Why do we seem to have this need to erase ourselves?" He also alluded that before HIV, we were besieged with alcoholism. Mr. Thompson feels, however, that we are on the right track and that we are getting to the point where one day, when a gay child is born into a family, that child will be looked at as a special gift to be treasured rather than an anomaly or a defect.  The bottom line is that the film achieved it's goal: it opened up much needed dialog. And it now appears to me that the collective whole needs to be talking a whole lot more. It occurs to me that we are now charged with the greater duty to coalesce as brothers and find some spiritual common denominator.

So once again, I fall asleep watching "Grey Gardens". I put the sleep timer on my TV to sixty minutes and p
