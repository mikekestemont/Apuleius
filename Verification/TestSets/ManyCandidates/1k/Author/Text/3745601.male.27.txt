Took the personality and looks test for match.com, here are the results.  The thing that I find most interesting is that it says that I like blonde hair.  I have never dated anyone with blonde hair nor do I find it especially attractive.  My friends say I don't like blonde women.  I prefer hispanic\latino women.  It also says I like mainstream women...    You're a hidden prince  You bring real passion to your life. To you life is about connecting emotionally with the people in your life and trying to make a difference in the world around you. You refuse to settle long-term for a boring job or doing something just because it's expected of you. Love is the same way.

Favorite Qualities  Your choices suggest a woman over 30 may be a little old for you  Mainstream, lovely women  Sharp, narrow chins  Wide and angular "diamond" or heart-shaped faces  Blonde hair    Favorite Looks  There's something about the energy and youthful appeal of "Cheerleaders" that's hard to resist. We use this name to describe a group of women who's facial features combine feminine beauty with a "tomboy" flair. They usually have blonde or light brown hair--cut short, small button noses, and wide smiles. These aren't "perfect" beauty contest winners. But their vivacious personality comes across even in photographs and makes their overall impression one of dazzling beauty.   There's a reason why you can't keep your eyes off a beauty pageant. We describe a lot of the women you also found attractive as "Beauty Queens," because of their flawless beauty and winning smiles. These women usually have long, shiny hair setting off a face that is either rectangular or heart-shaped. They have very feminine features like thin noses, big eyes, and full lips, conveying a strong, confident look rather than looking delicate or fragile. Even though they look like the "Girl Next Door," they tend to look mature for their age and lack the "cutesy" appearance of more "girlish" women. Although very popular to look at, most men are sort of intimidated by this type, which is probably why only 1 in 3 (31%) say they specifically seek out these women.   Favorite Face Type  You especially liked a pattern scientists refer to as "Ectomorphs." Geometrically, they are similar to triangles, because they are widest at the cheekbones and then narrow to a relatively pointed chin. Women Ectomorphs tend to have long, narrow noses and prominent cheekbones. Historically, these faces have been viewed as delicate, and combined with the typical lean build, can give a very feminine overall impression.
You know, Moore is being lauded as an intellectual, but he really just sees his point of view and doesn't want to look at the truth.

After I complained about not being able to find any of my old friends, Murphy's Law kicked in.  I was contacted the other day by one of them.  I'll keep you updated on my continuing efforts to find them all.
I was bored the other day and took this.     urlLink       So now all I need is a girl to magically appear in my life as I have no time to look for one.
And some more from the 'wonderful' match.com; too bad they can't find a cute single girl in my area.  Is it me or have all the cream of the crop already been taken?  It's not like I am looking for Ms. Perfect.  I do have expectations.  I'm not going to just jump on anything that comes my way.  On the bright side, my hairstylist is very attractive.  The downside of this is that I know she at least has been married.  I don't know if she is separated or divorced. (Hopefully the latter)  Maybe if I know her a little better, I will ask her out.     urlLink          urlLink          urlLink          urlLink          urlLink       With reviews like these, how could I be without a girl?

You know, my personal political opinions are just that... Opinions.  I don't presume to know the thoughts or directions that my pick for the presidential election has or is going.  As a matter of fact, I am so riled up about this, I am probably coming across as an uneducated redneck hillbilly.  What I would like to see is one, just ONE 'intellectual' actually point out all the negative traits that their pick has.  You know what the problem with that position?  It would require the person to see the truth.  Let us get a couple of 'truths' out in the open.  Kerry is about as trustworthy as a serial child m
