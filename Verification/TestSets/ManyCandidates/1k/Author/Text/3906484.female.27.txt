So, not suprisingly, I didn't connect with Kerry.&nbsp; I tried.&nbsp; But, it doesn't really matter -- I'm not the average mid-western, christian, battleground state voter.&nbsp; Does anyone really like John Kerry? Maybe,&nbsp;eh, I doubt it. &nbsp;Anyone that says they like him are just lying to themselves to make the whole process less painful.&nbsp;   However, Bush sucks more. What are ya' gunna do?&nbsp; Suck it up...moving swiftly along....   Brilliant analysis of the speeches by  urlLink William Saletan  from Slate. Sums up my thoughts exactly.&nbsp; Some highlights:   About Gephardt:    Poor Dick Gephardt. He's the guy who conspired with Kerry to stop Howard Dean in Iowa....What does Gephardt end up with? A seven-minute speech at 8:30 p.m. on the night when the networks won't be watching. He warms up the crowd for Tom Daschle, the Senate minority leader who decided not even to run for president. Worse, Gephardt has to deliver a line praising Kerry for picking Edwards. About Kucinich:    The band plays "Power to the People" as Kucinich takes the stage. He's one of those student-council types whose self-image as a world-historical figure can't be shaken by any audience or election result. About Bob Graham:    I stop taking notes. What possessed this man to run for president, I have no idea. He's so inanimate that when he delivers his last line, nobody's sure he's done. He simply steps back from the microphone and starts waving toward the Florida delegation. The band breaks into "Shout," which seems to be played only after the worst speeches. I guess it's the convention operators' way of waking people up. About Sharpton:    I'll say it again, he's a scoundrel. But if there's a better speaker in American politics right now, I'd like to meet him. About Dean:    If this were Dean's convention, how would it look? How would it sound? For starters, the nominee would be a lot shorter. Clinton was here last night, looking like a giant. Kerry's even taller. Standing where Clinton stood, Dean looks like a midget. Yet I'm certain Dean would have been a more authentic and authoritative heir to Clinton. Like Clinton, Dean believes he owns the room. Like Clinton, he doesn't need to search the crowd for approval. Self-approval is enough. It's the thing Kerry most conspicuously lacks, and the thing that can't be taught. About Teresa Heinz-Kerry, well, the whole thing is priceless -- do read it -- but here's an excerpt:    In the video, a friend vouches that Teresa has been "exposed" to people who have been treated badly. This is the way rich people talk about working people, and working people know it.
1. Have you seen this documentary called Trekkies?   OH MY GOD! Oddly enough, I'm sure the Democratic convention looks much the same, as did Howard Dean Meet-Ups.   2. The Struggle of messaging.   I'm sitting on my couch, trying to hone our message. What can we say to get you to vote for us? It's a fine line, a slippery slope.&nbsp; The goal is to say something "meaningful" with out saying anything at all.   What are campaigns anyway? Do we really live in a Democracy?   3. Check out cooler-than-hipster mag  urlLink Vice Magazine , especially the Dos and Donts.&nbsp; Funny shit. I particularly like the "gay Japanese B-boy from Chile who got a javelin scholarship and once gave birth." Is that a Do or a Don't?
I'm there.&nbsp; who's in?
So, I've been getting shit for criticizing the Democratic Party, namely Kerry. Well, it's because it's broken. The Democratic Party is broken and it lacks vision. It's bought and sold too, and those that choose not to see that are living under a rock.   Great article in the New York Times Sunday magazine this weekend. The cover story  urlLink "Wiring the Vast Left-Wing Conspiracy"  by Matt Bai explains this much more eloquently than I.&nbsp;&nbsp; Basically, we have no message and are unable to think past any given election day. We are currently the weakest we've been in decades and lack a game plan to market our selves and moblize.   This guy, Rob Stein, put together a 40 slide power-point mapping out the&nbsp; Right-wing take over of the last 30 or so years.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rob wants to essentially do the same thing and he and some others have formed the Phoenix Group, a clandestine group of wealthy donors that are sick of dealing with the Democratic Party establishment and are ponying up the money to rise from the ashes.   The goal is to save the party from "empty centrism."&nbsp;   Great article, read it.   Also note, the SEIU is doing great things for organized labor -- mixing it up a bit. Similar situation.
" urlLink Washington Wives " is a new reality TV show following Teresa Heinz Kerry and Elizabeth Edwards on the campaign trail.&nbsp; Surprise, surprise! Tereasa comes across as&nbsp;"pompous and slightly ridiculous." Sounds like her husband. They do own 5 homes, one of which was imported from England. These are the voices&nbsp;of the working class?   Where's Judy when we really need her!   BTW, i learned how to link! thanks phil james!
Interesting article in The Nation by Katrina vanden Heuvel this week called "Victory in 2004 -- and beyond." I'd link it but I'm not that smart.  &nbsp; She argues that the progressive voice has finally been heard and that now is our chance to really create substantial, effective positive change. I question this.&nbsp; Part three of her article discusses this "progressive uprising" where she states: &nbsp;   As has historically been the case, progressives gave Democrats their voice in the run-up to the 2004 elections. The campaign started with the unprecedented mobilization against the war in Iraq in 2002-03. Millions rallied around the globe, opposing a war that had not even begun. Although the Bush Administration spurned them, the New York Times heralded the demonstrations as signaling the rise of a new power in the world--global public opinion. And in the midst of that mobilization, progressive organizations here like MoveOn.org were expanding exponentially, building an Internet base of more than 2 million citizens.  &nbsp; When the lies and staggering incompetence of the W
