I read parts from Douglas Adams' books fairly regularly even though I have read most of his books several times over. I frequently come across stuff that I somehow did not pay adequate attention to. Today, I came across this:  Everybody has their moment of great opportunity in life. If you happen to miss the one you care about, then everything else in life becomes eerily easy.  - Douglas Adams (Mostly Harmless)  I think I missed this one because it had an SEP field around it ;-)
Guess you must have heard about Chetan Bhagat's book 'Five Point Someone'. The book is the story of IIT from the insider's perspective. Chetan is IIT Delhi and IIM A passout. The book was launched in Bangalore over the weekend. Do check out  urlLink a review .   Disclaimer: I don't have any vested interest in the book and I haven't read it myself. However, I have heard rave reviews from friends, so thought of recommending it to you guys, before I go and pick up a copy for myself.
So, I have finally managed to let go of my lethargy and shift bag and baggage to Blogger. I am testing if the team-blog thingie works properly and then I'll invite all the guys listed on the previous site to join the team.

Rated: R ( For use of strong language.)  Don’t read any further in this post if you are a goody-good kitsch asshole. I have posted many others for people like you but this one goes out as homage to  urlLink Holden Caulfield .  If you are reading this then you probably know what a blog is and in all likelihood you'll have one of your own. You often wonder that why your blog isn't as popular as some of the other pretentious bastards on the net who have got nothing else to do but brag about their stupid mundane life or voice their opinions about things that they can do nothing about. Then why do you do it? The simplest reason for this is the fact that as humans you are craving for attention and have a belief that you are the centre of the universe. You give too much importance to yourselves. You are part of a generation that has been raised by television commercials to run after things which do not make much sense but are a status symbol in the society. The whole fuss about a 1 GB GMAIL account all over the tech savvy community proves it.  I know that you are lying if you say you never wished for a GMAIL account. In all probability you would have mailed your friends for it, contacted complete strangers requesting for it, posted petitions on various blogs, yahoo groups and orkut communities. Just look inside and try to answer to yourself,   "Why do I need a 1 GB email account? "  I doubt that the most common answer will be something other than  status symbol .  Why is it that you can’t accept the harsh realities of life? Why is it that you are always looking for other people to approve your actions? Why do you  give a fuck  to what other people say about you?  I reread this post and changed all the  WE s and  I s to  YOU s so that it makes a better impact. I am also a part of the same ostentatious world you live in and think like you do. And if there are some people who are still looking for GMAIL invites, mail me your full name and email address, I have got 5 left.   urlLink My Blog
I know that by now they have lost their enigma, anyhow I have got 5 Gmail invites. If anyone still needs them, mail me your full name and email address at ravihanda@gmail.com. yahoo is creating some trouble with Gmail invites by sending them in BulkMail folder or treating them as Spam so i request you to give a non-yahoo email address.

the little red devils come marching upon me to take my body and claim my soul they know no limits, know no boundary they just march in to eat me whole  they march right in when i am sleeping they have no god apart from need from every crevice they come out creeping feeding on death, their only creed  they're everywhere the eye can see inside my room, upon my bed they crawl on my skin full of glee they even crawl inside my head  i cannot run, i cannot hide cornered thus, i have to fight they hurt me hard,they wound my pride crushing my soul with all their might  they have their fill,they take the spoils they leave me hurt, in deepest sorrow i make a resolve, my anger boils i'll kill those goddamned ants tomorrow!!!   this poem was inspired by an attack of red ants in my room(which hasn't been cleaned for ages and is fertile ground for wildlife activity!!!) which left me red-patched and itchy all over...
urlLink Al Pacino  once said in an interview, “You are as good as your last movie.” and I think the same concept can be applied to blogs too. If I create the profile of an average visitor to this blog it would be a 20-25 year old male, probably IITian, who never really had an actual opportunity to be in love. The question that I want to raise now is  “Is there h
