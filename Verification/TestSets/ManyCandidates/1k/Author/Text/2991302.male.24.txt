"Wrestlemania 20 in one hand. Cock in the other. Lube on standby and a goldfish on ice"  Quote Via Text Message from Gavin Evans  Could it be said any other way? Possibly. But after watching Wrestlemania XX the other day over at his house, I couldn't have put it better myself!  Thanks for the giggle Gav. BANG! BANG!
This past weekend saw the union of two former residents of the Haven (that's our house in Lochaber street), tie the knot. The following has been quite difficult for me to recall as I don't remember much of what happened, it just comes back to me in dribs and drabs but here goes...  Whiteway came up to stay at our house on the friday night before the wedding day. It was a good time to just catch up so we went to Royworld for a few beers. Aside from the DJ being absolute shit and the clientele looking like they had just learned motor-neurone skills, it was a good laugh. We decided to leave early and get some good sleep as we had an early start. A little later Zoe had returned a little drunker than usual armed with a Jumbo Sausage from the chip shop round the corner - I came the closest a man can be to being raped by a woman - suffice to say, it was a traumatising experience and Zoe - when I go to Thailand, I'll let you know what the going rate is for a simple op if you really want one!?  I awoke in a mischievous mood and no sooner had Steve gotten up and made himself a cup of tea, I had slammed a handful of squirty cream in his face (nothing rude here, honest!). It seemed like such a funny prank at the time except for the fact that my brother has a bushy beard (Castaway Styley) and all he could smell all day was a faint smell of off cream, no matter how much he tried to wash it out. That wasn't so bad for me, but listening to him moan about it all day was.  We travelled to Carmarthenshire in Whiteway's mighty Bora with its big paws and more gadgets than Jack Bauer, and we got to our respective B&Bs. Now, at the best of times, i think that Wales has some pretty funny looking names for places but I thought it was hilarious that my Brother and Zoe's B&B was called The Cottage Inn and Me and Whiteway were were staying next door at Pant-Y-Bas. George Michael and Kylie must be regular customers.  Anyway, the wedding, yes.... i was getting round to that bit. The ceremony was very natural and relaxed despite me and Steve thinking that Dom Joly was the Vicar and we thought that two blokes dressed as labradors would start fighting at the back of the church at any time. Rich and El looked like they really enjoyed it all despite not getting the weather they wanted - the wind could have blown the spots off a leopard!  The reception followed and after a tear jerking speech by El's Dad, Caunter did his best mans speech despite our efforts to put him off by our table wearing our Ray Gravell (of BBC Radio Cymru) face masks that we found in the pub. He found it so hard to tell a story about Rich that didn't involve the Stag Week in Prague or dead prostitutes.   After the main meal, many people went to get changed into more comfortable attire for the evenings drinking and dancing, however, there was a hardcore element who stayed on to smoke cigars and drink JD until the evening reception started. It'a hard life I know but in truth, I couldn't move because I had been eaten everything I could get my hands on, including some fake fruit and a bowl of pot pourri.  In the evening, everyone got very drunk and danced wildly into the night thanks to Pat Mustard and his Wheels of Steel (An old timer at the bar stated "The Disco's good -  it's not too loud and there are tunes you can really hum to!"). The bride and groom left for Mexico, Helen Cornish couldn't stop speaking french and I can't remember much else.  Sorry it's a bit long winded and probably a load of nonsense but I'm not gifted like Paul Carr, Shakespeare or Jilly Cooper.  As a final note, I want to thank Rich and El for a fantastic and enjoyable day. I was humbled to have been invited and I wish you all the happiness in the world.
Well, Rich and Els wedding wasn't soon enough for another "incident" to occur in my life, so, here goes- A friend (Matt James) from work was having a house party on Saturday night and we were informed that there was a fancy dress theme of "Bad Taste" of which myself and Owzy-O took too literally.  O arrived looking like a moroccan waiter (fake tan/ tweed jacket/ Big Ol' Glasses/ tasteless shirt) and I arrived in attire that cannot be expressed without the words "clashing" and "wrong size". Needless to say, we lived up to our part of the bargain. However, no-one else did. We were the only ones to actually believe Matts dress code and, in my opinion, we were glad because we would have put everyone else to shame....so there.  Anyway, the evening was enjoyable. We drank copious amounts of alcohol and didn't spend a penny (well maybe a couple). Big up to the attendees.....Matt, Perry, Katy, Richie Hanner, Dolph, Kev Crowley, even Andros (who, i was told, wanted a bit more of me than I'd like to know. Thanks for the info Matt but I'm strictly asexual).   The evening was going swimmingly (sorry!) and then even more so as Owzy-O and I were willing to take the theme of "bad taste" that next step. Danny Nuts (who was sadly not in attendance-For shame!) had planted the seed in O's mind to buy two goldfish from a pet s
