Hi there and welcome to my first posting, thanks for takeing the time to look in and i hope youll keep coming back and let me no how im doing.   Well i think i should start off by putting down what im hopeing to achieve here , why im keeping this blogg. whats it all about etc......  Well I have been fortunate enought ot recently find something that has been missing in my life for a very very long time, and something that is not at first easy to explaine. Im not like the majority of people out there and for a long period in my life ive known i dont fit in . normal life just dosent feel right for me i have a much deeper and more primal side that for far to long i needed to both become aware of and start to satisfy. so what am i yammering on about ??  well im a slave , a daddys boy and thats somethign which isnt at first easy to explain but is a huge part of who I am. I dont feel complete or a whole person without haveing something vitally important to my state of beeing ( God this is getting heaavy alreddy) I need to be owned controled and taken over completly by another man, and for those of you reading this who arnt in the bdsm comunity i no that this is goign to be a concept thats totally alien for you , and for that im very sorry. i hope youll bear with me as i fumble my way through trying to clarify all this .  There was until very recently a huge gaping hole inside me a need for something that for many years i didnt understand, im fortunate enough now to have become aware and come out to myself, which is wounderfull its given me a chance to be the person i need to be. Ive been fortunate enough to meet an incredable man, my Dad and Master, Bearfoot. Ive submited fully to his authority and am owned out right by him. what does that meen well basically I am his boy and slave, im here to satisfy his needs in every way and i couldent be more happy about it . for the first time in my life i feel totally complete and at peace. I have a long and very hard journey in front of me , im going to stumble a lot, I have alreddy and i no i will contimnue to do so. but im on a wounderfull journmey guided by my Dad and Master.   It involves giving over full controll of my life to him, all deescisions, financial controll, how i dress look act my day to day duties and responsabilitys, everything. And being owned totally. it involves Satisfying my Dads every need , be that a sexual, sadistic, or mundane house hold request . i Do it with out question or thought . total obedience. I no by now a lot of you will be eather horified or wont be able to get your heads round this, but belive me its a wounderfull and beutifull thing to give yourself totaly and completly to another man. to pass on all controll. to me it has been a case of giving up so litttle and gaining so much in return.  on wedensday 8th My Dad snaped his collour round my neck and i was finally and totally owned. and i cant tell you how proud I feel to ware this collor. well im begining to waffle here i have so much more to say but i think i need to calm my head a little before posting so illleave you with this . Im totaly new to this world but feel totally at peace and comfortable in it. I find it over whelming emotional scarey and for the first time in my life i no im exactly where i need to be. its going to be hard, its going to be very dificulyt at times its going to scare the hell out of me and im going to be pushed to places i never thought i could go , but its also going to be wounderfull and i cant wait . so keep poping in and ill keep you updated with all my hopes fears concerns happy and sad moments the mistakes i make, and the hurdles i climb for my Dad. im at the start of a wounderfull road here and i hope youll come along with me
Hi every body , once again I apologize for the lack of postings, my Dad came down to visit on Saturday and is staying here for a couple of weeks :)  you can imagine how chuffed I feel. Well things are going very well. Its almost a month since I earned my collar and so far so good. Im still blissfully happy .                 Well what have I been up to :) after I came back to Wales from Manchester I've been pining like there's no tomorrow , but now Dad's here and im walking 6 feet above the ground. We've had some magical days since Dad came down, the first  was on Sunday. At around 3 am we went for a walk up the hill behind the village , in the rain and with the thunder rattling around, we could see lightning on the horizon, and across the loughour estuary to llanelli all  light up.  Its quite a magical view. At he top we talked for a while then Dad ordered me to strip.  I did straight away and although ti was cold and wet and I was shivering, it was wonderful. I was standing there naked with my Dad on top of the hill watching the mist rolling in off the sea and feeling the rain power down over me. What made it even more magical was Dad telling me how proud of me he was.  It was a very special evening , very profound on a lot o
