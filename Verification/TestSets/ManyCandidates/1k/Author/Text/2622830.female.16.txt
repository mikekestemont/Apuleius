&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDon't you just love helping people out?  Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.  Like Monday, I was driving home and passed a tree branch half hanging in the road.  I didn't care and I was going about 55 so I just drove buy.  Tuesday it was still there and I was feeling like a good samaritan, so I pulled over and got it all off the road and out of the way.  Today though, I topped that by a mile!  Although today it was a bit more painful and 'draining.'  That's right, I donated blood today.  I think everyone should  urlLink donate blood . &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBasically, I did it through work.  I got outta work for over an hour and I still got paid for it.  And when I got back I didn't have to do any hard work.  But it was a really slow day and I was ahead of the game today so it didn't matter.  I went in and they asked me about all the drugs I do and all the sex I have with diseased 3rd world whores and all the time I spent in jail/juvienile hall and all the 3rd world countries I spent years in.  They poked my finger with a needle and got a drop of blood into some kinda tester thing and it said my blood was ok.  She sent me in the next room where they poked me...  AUGHHHHH!  YOU QUACK!  IT WHEN CLEAR THROUGH MY ARM!!!    Just kidding.  I didn't really yell that, but I was thinking about it.  Heh heh.  Well, the lady was really nice and did a great job.  I have good veins but since I'm a small guy, my bones are close so she has to make sure she doesn't pinch the vein against a bone.  She was great and talked to me and was really nice about it.  Some people don't know what they are doing and don't really care, but I only hear about that once in a while.  I'm a fast bleeder I guess because I was done in about 7 minutes and she said that has to be some kind of record for a guy my size.  Usually only big people are done quick.  It was only seven minutes, but it took FOREVER!  I absolutely hate having the needle in me.  It's kinda like the feeling you get when you hear fingernails scratching a chalkboard.  Only I felt it in my elbow.  Blegh!  It's still worth it though.  Blood supplies are low and I believe I have one of the more needed blood types.  I don't know which one it is, but the letter they sent me said it was the type they needed the most.  It makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside!  IDK.  America needs blood so do your part people!  Just go  urlLink donate blood , please!?  You get cool stickers that say "Be nice to me, I donated blood today!"  Then you can show it to your girlfriend, say something dumb, and she won't beat you up for it!  Yay!  I was thinking I should keep it on the paper and keep it in the glove box just incase I get pulled over for speeding.  What kind of cop would give a speeding ticket to someone who has a sticker that says, "Be nice to me, I donated blood today!"?  "Sorry officer, all the blood I donated must have made me not realize just how fast I was going."  And there's gotta be a million more uses for it.  Well, that's all for now.  Thanks for reading!    The answer is, 'Yes, you ARE your brother's keeper.'  It is YOUR responsibility to watch out for each and every other person on this planet.  Big responsiblity, huh?  Well, don't worry, there's about 6 billion more people who are suppose to be sharing that responsibility with you.  If everyone just does their part, it'll all turn out okay in the end.  Everyone else might not be doing it, but that's no excuse for YOU not to do YOUR part.  Besides, just look at the benefits of this plan, now YOU have 6 billion people who are watching out for you.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWell, I haven't posted much this week. It's waaaay past my bed time and I should go to sleep, but I'm going to post anyway.  I know I'll regret it tomorrow at work so here goes nothing. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFriday night Crystal and I went to Enfield so I could buy oil and an oil filter so I could change the oil in my truck.  Since Crystal waited in the truck, I didn't want to spend a lot of time looking around.  It took me long enough to find the stupid oil filter.  I saw some cool looking lock boxes/tool boxes for the bed of my truck but I just looked quickly.  Then we went to Marshal's and Dots so Crystal could buy some pants.  After we ate at Taco Bell, we called Jay and Meghan who were hanging out at Trainor's.  I called Meghan and saw her sitting outside as we drove buy so I stopped and we all ended up outside talking.  We left and went to the shed and had some fun for a bit. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSaturday, after I went to Enfield with Jay and Meghan, I went down a
