another month. ughhh      so my dad is going to s'pore for a few days in august. i've already got a whole new list of CDs and stuff to buy :P because i probably won't be going back for a long holiday before going to aussie, since most of my stuff is here anyway. i'm so prepared for going to aussie, i mean it's a new place and a new atmosphere and there are new people to pester WHAT MORE COULD I WANT. knowing my luck, the school will probably say they were kidding and why would they want a student like me anyway. or there will be some nuclear attack and all the schools will be destroyed. OR MY PARENTS WILL FORCE ME TO STAY HERE.      so the most exciting thing i've been doing this past few days is worry over whether or not i should tear up a new transworld mag (yesiDOhaveasociallife). monday i might go over to a friend's house because someone is leaving or something. but knowing me i'll wake up at 5pm and then call them up and complain because i didn't go :) i'm such a horrible person really.

yes nobody should skive off school it is very bad  VERY BAD.  it's so boring during the holidays, and yet i have the constant feel like there's going to be school tomorrow and i don't know what homework i have.&nbsp;some(normal) people adapt to the changes in schedule but no, i am damned to constantly worrying about english papers for the rest of my life.             since trevorrrr has left me for the kiwis(and sheep) i've decided to stalk her and part one of the plan is going to aussie, because well that's close to NZ right. but also the school is there and i have no other choice. i don't know what i'm talking about but you can't blame me, i haven't gone off topic because there was no topic to start off anyway.      &nbsp;    &nbsp;   i'm going to go see if i've done those math sums yet.

so in this bio lesson, right, trevor and i were extremely bored and we were singing Go, and then we decided to rip off Blink and make our own band called Wink183 even though we can't play any instruments and can't sing if our life depended on it. also, we horribly massacred the poor band members' names to make Trevor Farker and Pom TheLong. there you go.    &nbsp;  we are not weird, really.

i've got this awful cold which makes me heavy-headed and constantly have the need to blow my brains out. i'm hot and cold at the same time and i can't taste my food and i have to breathe through my mouth. i've gone through 5 of my dad's handkerchiefs which my friends so adoringly call "snot-rags". i don't sleep at night and when i do i sleep right through the day. and yet my parents think i'm lying about being sick. meh.  yesterday was the s'pore national day celebration at the ICC which to be truthful was so boring it was embarrassing. i spent the evening w
