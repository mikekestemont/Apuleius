Marblehead, 2003   Dude, the jerk hut is not reopening for the summer. I'm moving to Florida.
It could just as easily have taken place anywhere in the United States because I was driving my Jetta on the right side of the road. But in my dream last night, I was driving to London's Heathrow Airport at night (in unusually light traffic, I might add) when men standing along the road started flashing lights at the passing cars. I vividly remember the lights looked like a smaller, two-light version of a traffic signal, only white. When other cars stopped in the middle of the road and their drivers got out of the cars, I did the same. I asked someone what was going on and a man told me we were to kill the lights of our cars and lie down on the ground. He said it was a signal from the blackout days World War II to alert citizens that a bombing was imminent. Lights should be doused and people should take cover. While I understood we were in the middle of some sort of terror attack on London, I wasn't sure why we were being instructed to lie down, exposed, in the middle of the highway, but I did so. The first aircraft was a helicopter, which I saw rise from between two sections of the highway and explode. It wasn't close enought to me to be a danger. Then second helicopter lifted up and exploded. The third was a small, commuter-sized airplane, which lifed off over the highway then exploded. Again, not close enough to be a danger to me or the others lying on the highway, but frightening. While at the time I didn't know what sort of damage the explosions created or how many people might have been killed, the size of each aircraft made me wonder if these particular terrorists might not have been the most intelligent of the lot. After the plane explosion, I stood up and said that I wasn't going to lie out in the open anymore.  While others around me protested, others followed me to the edge of the road. We crawled down an embankment and ended up hiding beneath rows of grapevines in a vineyard, where we found ourselves among a group of United States soldiers. They told us we shouldn't be there, but took us to a shelter where we stayed the rest of the night. Then I woke up.
Most days I spend with Caroline are fun, and today was no exception. It began with us jamming to Bob Marley and the Wailers "Legend" on the way to the Westlake soccer tournament. The tournament started yesterday, but I couldn't go because I had to work, so one of the other girl's mother took Caroline along. They won one game and lost the other yesterday. So, now that you're up to speed, the team lost their first game this morning. That wasn't such a bad thing, but what  was  a bad thing was the mother of one of our players who was under the impression that she was the coach. She yelled instructions, and loudly pinpointed everything the girls did wrong, even when they did what she had loudly proclaimed earlier would be the "right" thing to do. I tried to be tactful, but I told her that A. the girls are too busy playing to listen to her, and B. all parents should get out onto the field sometimes and experience what it feels like to have people coming at you because you have the ball, and then try to dump it off  to a teammate  before someone steals it. You know what she said? "I know they're not listening, but it makes me feel better." Dumb bitch. During the break between games, Caroline and I went to McDonald's for lunch, where we OD'd on Happy Meals just to get the mini plushie Neopets -- her latest favorite thing. From there, we went to Borders, where I picked up a copy of "Wicked" by Gregory Maguire. I'll let you know how it is. After that, we stopped at the tournament HQ to buy Caro a tournament T-shirt before heading to the fields for the second game. They lost, but were appeased by the participation trophies they received. When the tournament ended, Caroline and I went to the Build-a-Bear Workshop, where she selected, stuffed, groomed, named and dressed in soccer attire, a Border Collie plushie, aptly named "Mia." I bought Scott a pair of jeans at Aeropostale (with the promise of cutting off the label if they fit), but they are too tight for his fat little ass, so back they go. Mexican dinner, stop by mom's to tell her about the tournament and then home. One of the neat things from the tournament was a tradition of teams trading patches after each game. Because we're just a little ghetto team, our girls didn't have patches to trade, but came home with patches from two of the teams they played. So, now I'm off to sew them on. And if you happen to be wondering what I'm planning for tomorrow, the answer is  nothing . Absolutely nothing. Happy Memorial Day.
Guess what I'm doing today.    Sandusky 2003
I'm really glad during the graduation I covered this morning for the paper, none of the three valedictorians uttered the words "the best four years of our lives." Oh, sure, we got leaving footprints, embarking on a journey, making the world a better place and using education as a map to success. Fortunately, however, we didn't have to hear about how high school is the best time of your life. Because those of us who have been there, done that know better. College beats high school hands down, but that's still not the best time of your life. Your wedding day... even with a bad perm and a dress you would never choose again, if given the choice, wedding days still eclipse high school. Buying your first house... pretty damn cool, too. But nothing, absolutely nothing c
