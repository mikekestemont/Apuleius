Prince MORE Attack S 920, endorsed by  Sharapova .  Reminds me of the Saab 900 S. One more reason to buy this!
Brand spanking new badminton racquet.
Nice spanking new squash racquet.
An entry level Seagull acoustic. Love it, want it, need it.
I saw these in Hype today. In brown. Very nishe. They're meant for yoga but I think they'll be good for dance too.
I found out today that amidst the chaos of my moving house, some poor and pathetic bastard nicked me bin!  Can you believe it, it's a bloody rubbish bin for crying out loud! MY bloody rubbish bin! It also happened to contain a bottle of mortein for roaches, which I had planned on using to eradicate the roach population at my new place. More importantly, placed on the top was a pair of shorts I had borrowed from a friend. There is nothing worse than losing someone elses belongings whilst they are in your care. I'll have to get her a new pair now. Damn chinatown cheapskates!
It's February 29th! This date only comes once every 4 years so I have to post something, anything!  Time for a little reminiscing. The last time it was February 29th, I was starting 3rd year uni, not believing that I had made it so far without flunking any subjects (not counting those conceded passes, ok). I was still living at Mulwaree with the MSO bunch, about to encounter the killer OS class which I so dearly loved. End reminiscence.  On a totally unrelated note, can I just say how annoying it is to receive missed calls on your mobile from people not in your address book. I normally just ignore the numbers, but curiosity got the better of me this time.  Just then, I decided to ring back one of the missed call numbers I got during the week. On the other end was an answering machine for either the  death  or the  health  society. The women was way too soft and I could hardly hear anything. Whatever it was, I had no idea, which just frustrated me even more, because now I have to ring back again during business hours to find out why they tried to ring me!  There was another missed call which I received today, from an 08 number. I haven't had any 08 calls since, like, 1.5 leap years back. This was back in the days when I didn't even own a mobile. I will leave that question mark for next week maybe.
As unhealthy as this may sound, I had a hot dog for breakfast this morning.  This hot dog, topped with ketchup and mustard, suddenly got me thinking,  "God, I used to hate mustard, when did I change my mind about it and why do I love it so now?"   I then went on thinking about all the other things I used to hate, but now love, and things I used to love, but now hate. There are also things I used to feel strongly about, which don't seem to matter much anymore. It really disturbs me that people can change. I'm a firm believer of the fact that no matter how people change, they are still the same person deep down inside.  So I decided to list down all my  changes  as I discover them. I shall start with the mustard.  I used to whinge in disgust whenever  mustard  was in sight, yet now I lavish in the taste of it. Thinking about mustard makes me drool.  Then there are  tulips . My favouritest flowers in the whole wide world. I thought they were really very very special. Now when I look at them I think about how fast they are going to die compared to other flowers, like, gerberas. I like  urlLink gerberas  now.  *More coming soon
I have a really bad habit of editing my previous posts. I just can't help myself. I keep changing my mind on what I should w
