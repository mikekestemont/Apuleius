Rain on Halloween! Blasphamy... I hope it's not raining in Santa Cruz... it would be a shame if the freakshow got rained out
Hm... today's events included going to In-N-Out with Jesse for a contradictory meal of a protien-style double-double and a vanilla milkshake. Good thing I dodged the carbohydrate bullet of the burger bun... and then sucked down a shake loaded with sugar. Well done.  Then we embarked on a futile quest to find something that would let Jesse play a PS2 on his computer monitor, but it turns out the fat cats at Gamespot, Radio Shack, and Fry's won't stand for that kind of rebellious choice in video screens.   I called around looking for stuff to do in Santa Cruz tomorrow. Jenny's hanging out with her boyfriend, and I couldn't get a hold of Alicia... who'd have thought? So I'll be hanging out with Jenna for the most part.  My "costume" will somehow involve my fake hand, probably sticking out of my jacket pocket. I'm not about to do anything where I can't wear my jacket- it's gonna be cold as all hell out there.   Popup blocker count: 1193  Just watched Super Troopers. Pretty funny, if cliche.
Wow, my laptop is up to a record $330 (including shipping) more than I paid for it on Dell's site. Nothin' like seeing something like that to make you feel like a good bargain hunter.
Stupid blogger was down for maintainace last night, so I was unable to post about how bored I was. Damn you blogger, damn you to hell.   I'm downloading Supertroopers and The Way Of The Gun. I'm starting to get back into the mode where I feel like if I'm not constantly using all 150kBps of my DSL connection I'm being wasteful. Can't have that.   I went to the shoreline lake/resivior/whatever thing yesterday and walked around it. It'd be fun to rent a sailboat sometime and cruise around, but the bastards say you have to be certified to rent one, and knowing Shoreline it'd cost an arm and a leg to get certified.  I got another email from the editor of pc.IGN.com with another round of game scraps to review. He also said he thought I'd been too hard on Eric Young's Squad Assault: Westfront "simply because it is a war game," and that he was going to play it himself before posting the review. Bleh. Personally I think he'll agree with me once he plays it- it was pretty half-assed. I just sent him a reply saying that I stand by everything I wrote with the exception of ommitting the scenairo editor in the replayability score.
Terminator 3 was pretty mediocre... it's even more surprising now that I've seen it that Arnold won the election so soon after that movie. It wasn't bad, but I'm glad I didn't pay to see it either. Hopefully Once Upon A Time In Mexico will be better.  I'm on another downloading blitz. Barenaked Ladies' new album, Everything To Everybody, is pretty damn good so far. I've been using Friendster to find people with similar musical tastes to my own and seeing what else they like. So far I've gotten Guster (good) Flaming Lips (so far so good) Badly Drawn Boy (ok) and some other stuff that was crap and I deleted it already and don't even remember what it was. I'm also getting some stuff from Ben Folds Five and The Smiths that I haven't listened to yet. So I'll have to revise my playlist again sometimes soon to incorporate some of this new stuff. I forgot to add Coldplay and Evanescence last time too.  Now if I can just figure out some reason to leave the house... there's bloody nowhere to go around here.
Alright, I am ready to announce the new additions to my playlist. Drumroll...  The White Stripes - Hotel Yorba The White Stripes - We're Going To Be Friends Dido - White Flag Outkast - Hey Ya Queens Of The Stoneage - No One Knows R.E.M. - Bad Day The Postal Service - Such Great Heights The Postal Service - We Will Become Silhouettes The Cardigans - Please Sister  Some of these will doubtless be whittled out the next time I pare down the playlist... Hey Ya's novelty will wear thin after a while I'm certain. Dido may or may not make it, and this Cardigans song just barely made it on the list.  I'm not wild about the new Strokes - Room on Fire album. It sounds just like the last one, which was good for a song or two, but gets old after a while. No keepers on there thus far.   I'm also downloading Terminator 3 and Once Upon A Time In Mexico, because if tomorrow is anywhere near as dull as today I will need all the entertainment I can get, and I sure as hell ain't gonna pay to see a movie with Arnold in it ever again.
Ug... nothing... to... do...  I started reading Angelmass by Timothy Zahn the other night, but haven't really gotten into it yet, mostly because I've been picking up the book at 1:30 and only had about 15 minutes of reading in me at that point.   I made an omlette today that didn't taste like crap. Sometimes I amaze even myself.  I must have accidentally left "send me bullshit spam" checked when I made my NowhereDan screen name, because I've gotten a couple of AOL ads in the last few days. Jerks. Stupid Outlook tells me I've got new mail even when it has already deleted it as spam... must find a way around that.   Final verdict: Audio Slave = one hit wonder. If that. Like A Stone isn't  that  good a song. Got another Queens of the Stoneage song I like called No One Knows, bringing their grand total of good songs up to 2. I think Evanescence has two songs I'll keep, and The Postal Service has one or two. Maybe one off that new Cardigains album. When I finally pick them out and put them in my playlist I'll p
