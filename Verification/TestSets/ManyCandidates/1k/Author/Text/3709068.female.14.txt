I hate this typing thing. I type something up and it's deleted...*twitch* well nevermind that.   I have discovered the secret to why Heero Yuy never dies when he commits suicide.  Duo is afraid that if Heero dies, then he will never get to have hot yaoi mansex again because Quatre and Trowa are never leaving each other and Wufei is just ugly. So whenever Heero tries to kill himself, Duo just goes on break, which really pisses off his employer, because he gets paid breaks.  Metal Dungeon sucks. Never rent a game you've never heard about, because it will most likely suck. They call it a horror game? HA!! I get creeped out more by Elmo's World than I do this game.

Well, I found Aki's password - again -  Being this the Blog of Yusha, we decided to create our very own Yusha fanlisting/shrine. Now you can become a Yusha Knight! Just go to http://www.freewebs.com/yusha/ to find out how. And remember kids, SPINES ARE FOR WUSSIES!
Today I am at Amee's house. She has(or had maybe) this idea of making a HP story focusing on the lesser houses if Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff. And I got my own character ^_^ so I had to be sorted into a house.  So I'ma taking the quiz thingy and guess what? I get Gryffindor. =.= Great, I share house with "I-know-everything" bitch and the amazing reproducing weasels.(Weasleys) (STOP MATING DAMMIT!!!) And as I sit in the thrilldom of being a Gryffindor I wonder "why me?" I mean I should at least get Ravenclaw, if anything. Amee got Ravenclaw. I get multiple redheads. Everyone gets into Gryffindor. WHY CAN'T I GET SOMETHING ORIGINAL?!?   Gryffindors are all honorable and noble and brave and crap like that. Honorable? Do I look like I'm from Ruroni Kenshin? AM I A GODDAMN SAMURAI?!? Noble? Hell, I belch whenever I feel like it. I am known to sit with my legs apart whilst wearing a skirt. DOES THAT SOUND NOBLE TO YOU?!? And finally, brave. I can't go through one episode of Unsloved Mysteries without cringing and wanting to call a friend to comfort me.  I ain't a Gryffindor. I am a Ravenclaw. Hell, I am more Slytherin than Gryffindor(er...I think...) Why would I be Gryffindor? So I'll just sit here in my "wonderful" House of Gryffindor and not stare at the twins's asses.   Mood of the Day: Sadistic and hungry...I WANT FOOD!!!*puppy whine* Bishie of the Day: Most Definatly NOT the twins. NOT. *is NOT staring thank you very much.*
So as I was sitting and waiting for my brother to finish up his game of...TWISTED METAL BLACK!!! so that I could play the glorious Xenosaga, I decided to come up with something fun in my odd little brain. Comparing my favorite game with a crazy clown to my favorite show with a clown who is dating a blonde "male" creature.   As I sat I thought about all the ways they were similar and, suprisingly, they were very much the same....(conspiracy!!)   TM: Black's storyline: play as a crazy person who may or may not have committed various crimes, seek revenge for something, or have serious mental issues. Gundam Wing's storyline: 5 crazy boys with traumatic pasts have to go around committing crimes to seek revenge for something, or just because they have serious mental issues. TM: Black's goal: to kill everyone else so that they can win a wish!! Yes this sounds lame but they have really sadistic wishes.... Gundam Wing's goal: kill all the members of OZ so they can get their er.... wish of peace I suppose. Well, It's a wish, ain't it?   Heero Yuy: he killed a little girl and her doggie and so now he's traumatized. Is stalked by Relena Darlien/Peacecraft/Yuy/ whatever and he threatens to kill her. Heero is 'the perfect soldier' so he's kind of  cold killing machine. TW counterpart: Outlaw: a cop who killed a little girl so now he is traumatized. May or may not be stalked by Sweet Tooth, who threatens to kill him. Is also a cold killing machine, though he really doesn't realize it yet.   Duo Maxwell: some hyper-ass who enjoys talking and having pretty hair. He also enjoys killing and is Death incarnate. Has many many many fangirls who want to run their hands through his long, silky hair. XD Has no parents and is a orphan who was brought in by the church but then the church was bombed (I think...-.-;;) TW counterpart: ....uh I dunno! Duo is pretty original. There is the church man who drives Brimstone... in some ways he could be compared to him... but not really =.=  Quatre Rabinna Winner: an adorable little blonde boy who really doesn't like killing, but kills anyways. He's most definitely the classiest Gundam boy (we ain't counting the OZ peeps) and he likes TEA!!! (personally I only like really sweetened ice tea, but that's just me) He seems to be the shortest cuz everyone else is so tall and intimidating. His mommy was killed giving birth to him. :'( TW counterpart: as creepy as it is, Yellow Jacket: a little boy who is really smart. He hangs out with his daddy a lot... even though his dad is dead. The little boy re-animated the corpse. So he isn't much like Quatre but he has the adorable blonde kid thing working for him.  Trowa Barton: He's quiet. He's a clown. He has some memory issues if I remember correctly. And his hair is kinda weird. TW counterpart: Sweet Tooth: evil clown who kills things and his head is on fire. So he has wierd hair. If he ain't Trowa I dunno who is!!  Wufei Chang: He's kinda ugly. He's kinda mean, but he wuvs his dead wife("THIS CONCEPT OF WUV CONFUSES US!!!" -Futurama) Wufei is chinese so they gave him a wierd nose. This is probably why they made him so ugly, just because he is Chinese.... :'( TW counterpart: Junkyard Dog: A ugly dude with a
