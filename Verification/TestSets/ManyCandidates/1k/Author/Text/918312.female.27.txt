"I talked to [UN  Secretary-General] Kofi Annan the Sunday before the president decided  to go to war.  And I knew at that moment in time that the Russians  and the French were prepared to, in fact, make a further offer."   (MSNBC's "Hardball," 10/20/03)  October 21, 2003: Says I'll Tell You Later.  "`I have it on the  highest authority' that the French and Russians were prepared to make  an offer at the UN, but were rebuffed by American officials intent on  going to war, Kerry said. `I'm going to talk about it more publicly  at a later time.'

Have you ever had a really bad headache, then you took some tylenol (or excedrin migrane in my case since I knew it was a migrane coming on) and then a few hours later your whole head tingles? Mine is doing that right now, and it feels totally funny but a good funny. Like I don't want it to stop. hee hee. I'll be back later with some real news. I swear I haven't done any illegal substances....not yet anyways.
Nothing pisses me off than offering something only to have it snached away. Long story short, I invited the  urlLink madponies  to KC for Jessica Simpson. Well, the station didn't have a venue and when they got one, boom, they wanted the show 18 and over. Grrrr.....so Lauren can't go. Pisses me off. I hate when they do that. They alienate 30% of our listeners. Makes me mad!!!!!!!!!!! Why? So now I've got Stacie Orrico tickets, at Orlando's. Tammy wants those and she's gotta sit in the front row and scream. I'm gonna make her.
Sunday Morning Barf Bag!   So I wake up this morning, an hour late because of daylight savings time (remember to change your clocks) to find a fresh pot of coffee (yes!) and cute little moron George Clooney on CNN's  urlLink Reliable Sources . Now I'm all for people promoting their movies and all but it really didn't surprise me that Georgie the liberal idiot was on the leaning so left it walks with a tilt CNN because he had things to say that people care about. I care Georgie, really I do but come on hunny. When was the last time you had a hit movie? Ocean's 11. This last one doesn't count because Catherine Zeta Jones is in it and everyone's going to see her anyway. Thankfully, I only saw the tail end of the show where they talked about all around cool guy, urlLink  Mr Bill O'Reilly  and his repeated requests to have George in a tet-a-tet on the O'Reilly Factor on Fox. George's response? Well, if CNN and Reliable Sources were more reliable, I would post what he said verbatim but unfortunately, I can't find it at the moment so I'll sum up. He accused Bill of only wanting him on during sweeps and that he would talk to him on Larry King, and only Larry King and when he wasn't selling a book. Excuse me, Mr Clooney, but aren't you promoting a movie called Intolerable Cruelty? Pot, meet black kettle.   Also got a chance to check out George Snuffalupagus and the "new all fancy, we're trying so hard to be like Fox" This Week Sunday News show.  How fun. Cute as he is, he can't help but be stupid, huh?
Okay, it's offical. I'm obsessed. I can't help myself. I've watched Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers again. I need a serious intervention   But Viggo Mortensen is hot!!!!
