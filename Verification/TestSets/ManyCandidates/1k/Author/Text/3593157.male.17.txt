Sorry to be posting all these silly links and stuff but this one, I assure you, is really funny. It's worth the download.

And doesn't his daughter go there?   Then again, maybe Mr. Bush was just recruited by the university for his superb cheerleading skills:     But yeah, I agree with him. I hope he pursues that stance and wasn't just saying it to impress the minority reporters that he was addressing.
The July employment numbers wre released today. Select your poison:   urlLink http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,128209,00.html   urlLink http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/06/business/06CND-ECON.html   urlLink http://www.iht.com/articles/532875.html   Looks like payroll growth was alarmingly weak this month.   Now I'm not saying that this is all Bush's fault but it looks like Bush's plan to create jobs by handing out tax cuts isn't faring so well. He still seems convinced so though:  "Because of my policy of strengthening the economy while enforcing spending discipline in Washington, we remain on pace to reduce the deficit by half in the next five years." ( urlLink http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,127678,00.html )  Hmm, I don't see how permanent tax cuts, insanely high spending, and weak job growth is going to reduce the deficit. I mean seriously, reducing your source of income and increasing spending do not go well together.  Seriously, economically-speaking, the Bush administration has been one of the most liberal administrations in recent history. They're almost too liberal for my taste!    Addendum:  By the way, Bush's quote was "We're turning a corner and we're not turning back".   Kind of similar to something another great President said not too long aog: "prosperity is just around the corner". That President was Herbert Hoover and he made that statement during the Great Depression. He was the last President in history to preside over a net job loss.
Hey officer. Sorry I just fatally hit that old woman while speeding with my SUV. I was on my way to deliver this fresh batch of cookies to the post office. I'm sending them to the troops. I support the troops. What's that? You're arresting me? But officer! You can't arrest me, what about the troops? You INSIST that I step out of the car? That'a outrageous, officer! I'll bet you're French. If you're not French, I'll bet you've been to France. AND YOU LIKED IT THERE! Odds are you like Michael Moore as well (Michael Moore is a socialist pig!). I am reporting you to your supervisor for sympathizing with terrorists, officer. That's basically what you're doing. By not letting me get to the post office, you're depriving the troops of the goods they need to defeat terrorists and A-rabs. How could you?! I know the problem! You're a liberal, aren't you? The downfall of our country. You should be ashamed! Now let me pass, or the terrorists and gays have won! That's right officer. Just go back in your car and pretend this never happened. You  may have let someone that has broken the law go, but you're supporting the troops! God bless you, officer! I'll get these, uhm, cookies to the post office right away!
That was our Commander in Chief, addressing a number of Pentagon officials earlier today, at a defense appropriations bill signing ceremony. Immature, yes, I know, but hey, maybe Bush is finally confessing to the Valerie Plame scandal!

What has America come to when perverted religious teachings have infiltrated the state constitutions of the United States?  Recently, Missouri passed an amendment to their constitution banning gay marriage. In November a measure will be on the Oregon ballot attempting to ban gay marriage.  With 60% of Americans favoring a constitutional amendment this will be pass easily.  WHAT THE FUCK!  How could 60% of Americans favor limiting the rights of their fellow citizens.  What is wrong with gay marriage?  I'll tell you what Americans don't like about it: the bible condemns homosexuality.  People feel that they need to subject the rest of our country with their religious views.  The last time I checked the Constitution of the United States of America said that Church and State would not mix.  This has got to be the most blatant violation to our constitution I have ever seen.  We cannot allow a 2000 year old book dictate the way we live.  People have used the bible to protect slavery, and in the 60s some states banned interracial marriage citing the bible as their guiding light.  How foolish Americans will feel in 50 years when we look back at our homophobic actions.  Text books will describe how one president even tried to pass an amendment banning gay marriage.  As an American, I have learned that every person is born with certain inalienable rights, and that everyone should be able to exercise them.  And, today, Americans are trying to stop their fellow citizens from doing so.

(click the title)    (as of August 5th)  That's a really interesting site that, instead of viewing polls in terms of the popular vote, breaks them state by state to display them in the way that matters: at the electoral college. According to their projects, Kerry is beating Bush by 70 votes in the electoral college. As you can see though, most of the states Bush has are states that he's holding on to very strongly. He's "strong" in all of them. I think whats going on is that, by adopting such a conservative agenda, Bush is bringing out lots of new voters. Problem is: he's bringing these votes out in the conservative strongholds. He's doing nothing but strengthening and solidifying his base, which can be a good thing for fundraising and campaigning but when it comes to the vote and when it comes to the electoral college, that won't help him. In this country, elections are decided by a select number of swing voters in a select number of states. Those v
