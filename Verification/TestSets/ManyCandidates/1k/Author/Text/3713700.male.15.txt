Hi all! Literature will rock this term! Kevin Cheng's taking me for Singaporean Lit while Edmund Teo's taking me for Lit Stylistics. Kevin's quite nice but Edmund totally rocks!!! During Singaporean Lit, we just went through some admin stuff and introduction to Singaporean Lit. But during Lit Stylistics, we went through the poem below. The main theme is to get young people to enjoy their youth and well, have sex while they are still young... Hehe... We were preddy reluctant to say the theme of sex at first and put it in quite subtle language. However, Edmund went to the board and wrote SEX real big, and he said: "On my count of three, You all shall say this word loud and clear. This poem also has the theme of..(one, two, three).. SEX!!!!" It was quite funny... But this is a great poem in which the metaphors and images all fall together nicely to create this wonderful picture of youth. Enjoy..   To the Virgins, to make much of Time    by Robert Herrick      GATHER ye rosebuds while ye may,      Old Time is still a-flying:    And this same flower that smiles to-day      To-morrow will be dying.       The glorious lamp of heaven, the sun,             The higher he 's a-getting,    The sooner will his race be run,      And nearer he 's to setting.       That age is best which is the first,      When youth and blood are warmer;    But being spent, the worse, and worst      Times still succeed the former.       Then be not coy, but use your time,      And while ye may, go marry:    For having lost but once your prime,      You may for ever tarry.
Well, first day of school. Lugged my heavy body and soul up to my classroom, feeling stoned. But one i stepped in, the referencing of homework struck me and I got into referencing mode. After flag raising, sat through Math half-asleep/awake. However, the next lesson woke me up. IH1 - Lit Stylistics with Mr Edmund Teo. HE ROCKS! EDMUND YOU ROCK! First thing he stepped into class, he sat on a table behind, feet on chair. We quietened down, and greeted him and sat down, facing, erm, the front. He said to do what he was doing and face him (btw he was still on e table). And he said: "On the table." We were stunned. But he is real fun! We spent the lesson sitting on the tables, feet on chairs. Literature Stylistics - a module that is skill-based. To enable us to appreciate Literature, Life, the World around us from multiple perspectives. To enable us to see things beneath the surface. He conducts his lessons very casually. In a very relaxed environment. I love it. Following his lesson was reccess and boooring physics practical... Haiz... Dun wish to talk abt dat. And then came Chinese and English. Nutters... 4 double periods today man... Haish...

Ah yes, before I begin my entry proper, XSLC RULEZ! Haha, anyways, after watching the play Of Trees and Boys by TCHS English Drama, we lazed around at the terraces, singing and talking and looking at the clouds in the sky. Then we decided to go somewhere. At first did not know where to go, den decided on the ice cream shop at 6th Avenue ( I DUNNO THE NAME OF THE SHOP CAN?! ) But upon arrival, we found that the place was packed. And dear dear Iffy had to break out a laugh just then and due to the exceptionally high ceiling of that piece of architecture, the volume of her laugh was amplified like many times and it was damn funny... hehehe... Anyway, coffee bean was full too so we decided to settle down at the coffeeshop opposite and eat prata. Quite nice, the prata, but the KOPI was GOOOD!!! YUMMYLICIOUS KOPI! Anyway, talked sumore crap and Iffy was sho sweet to treat us to the drinks lor... (THANKS IFFY!) Anyhoo, after that, walked to e bus stop to take 852 back to Yishun with Xin Ying and Lanfang... Chatted till Yishun den as usual, go home lor...
Ah yes, first of all, THANKS RACH (for that wake up call)!!! Anyway, I woke at 2.30AM, went down to watch the match. I was sorta expecting France to play like a pack of hungry wolves. In the end, 15 mins into the first half and they were already looking like dead wolves. It was horrible. Greece, on the other hand, played wonderfully with strength, gusto and tenacity. They wanted that magical goal badly. France were still struggling to find their 'beat'. Passes were going awry, runs cut short by the stout defence of the Greeks, holes in the defence that were exploited, non-running players etc etc. Horrible horrible horrible. However, Greece played nice footie! Fluid football, great teamwork, great passing, good possession and players who are always on the move. The French looked like old folks playing against a bunch of young energetic hungry youngsters. The second half was not just as bad, France began to find their tempo. But it was not enough. Their defence SUCKED. 25 minutes before time, Greeks scored. Theo Zagorakis received a long pass, strode down the right flank, got past 1 defender, held the ball and waited to pick out Charisteas before chipping in a cross which was met by a superb header to slot the ball into the top right corner of the net. France was stunned. Barthez had no chance at all. Greek football a
