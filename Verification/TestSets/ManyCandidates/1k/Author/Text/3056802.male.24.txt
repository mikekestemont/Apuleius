Ever notice how stupid people are?   I work for a company that save people money... seriously, we cut communication costs, and take a part of the savings, therefore still saving them some money.  I call people on a daily basis that just don't want to save money. Apparently it's so abundant out there (money that is) that people don't want to store some away for a rainy day. they'd rather just piss it against a wall and bitch about how expensive shit is. Fucking dumb... yes I swear a lot... puck off... (better?).  Add to the fact that I'm convince 9 out of 10 "manager's" out there are fucking computer illiterate.  Ever been asked the question what's that cool program you're using to have to respond with the answer of "Microsoft Excel".  IT"S FUCKING EXCEL...  Who the fuck doesn't know what excel is in the year 2004. GET A CLUE.  AND...  How many of you people out there have a fucking swear jar in your office.  Oh and for all those bible thumbing god lovers out there, I understand your religion is important, but don't push it onto me, and relegate Christ (the Lord's name) as a swear.. seriously, think about it, when someone utters the lords name... not taken in vain, it's calling the lord, isn't that ackowledging him, which is what he wants, and even if it is in vain, it's a staple of society, people have been conditioned to use the word in that manner and not mean it the way Jesus boy in the corner is taking it... STOP REPRESSING FREE SPEECH.  FUCK.   Oh and check out this website.. freaking cool...  urlLink PixelRanger

Friendship in all forms.    You never fully realise the greatness of people until you leave them, then come back and realise how much they mean, or how little.&nbsp; When you think of someone you think of their qualities, when sometimes a person's presence is the most cherished thing, being around them, enjoying who they are, and what they are.  I love being around the people I currently have in my life, as they are truly wonderful people, and a few are the best things to ever happen in my short existance, without them, I don't know if I would be the person I am today, and even though my past month has been one of questionable greatness, without them, I don't think I would of survived.&nbsp; I love my friends, and I love my Friend even more, she has so much to offer it astounds me on a daily basis.  Cherish the people who care for you, that make your day better, because without them, your days might not be as great, or as fulfilling, I can guarantee that.  And with that I hit the hay, with dreams and wonder filling my little head
A World of Unsureties       &nbsp;  Surrounded by people, that love you, that care for you, that want to make sure you are okay, when you are faced with adversaries, whether mental or physical you stick them out.&nbsp; You face them head on and you tangle them blow for blow.    &nbsp;  I've tried convincing myself and others to follow what you think is the best course of action, unless you run... to date i've stood by my decisions and backed them 100% never giving up, fighting the good fight, wanting what's best for myself and others.    &nbsp;  NEVER RUN... or you just end up regretting what you left... trust me, i've tried it and it doesn't work.    &nbsp;  I Love You Shannon, don't run from this...    &nbsp;  You wanted something less cryptic... this is it right here... straight as a fucking arrow... don't fucking run.    &nbsp;  JB out for the night
A Life of Consequences and Rememberance...       &nbsp;  Well life has been interesting, I'll give ya that.. events occur and we as human beings adapt and evolve to meet the circumstances and to overcome them.&nbsp; We as human being have an amazing ability to adapt to any situation, and to take what life throws our way and battle it blow for blow.    &nbsp;  Have you ever been in love... the true love, where you care for someone more than you do yourself, where you want only the best in life for that person, you strive to achieve more for them, than for you on occassion...&nbsp; That is the love i'm facing right now, and it is the highest intoxication available to the human race, drugs hold no candle to this.    &nbsp;  It was pointed out to me today by a woman, that everything I stand for, who I am, to the core of my being is one of the most honourable and noble things a person can be.&nbsp; This woman doubted my intentions as most people do, thinking I am only out to gain the best for myself, as most of the human race does, and to be honest I think that is so disheartening.    &nbsp;  When you are like myself, you strive to make others happy, and hopefully in turn you become happy yourself, knowing that you've enriched people lives somewhat or fully.    &nbsp;  I believe I did that for a person, and because of that I was in my element, I loved her, I loved seeing her become more, learn, try new things, overcome past fears, and to be there for her as someone she could truly rely upon... I did not cheat, I did not lie to her, I treated her as I wish I could be treated.    &nbsp;  Now because of someone that is deceitful, someone that wants only what he can get and not think of the consequences or how many people he hurts, everything I am, everything I stand for, and everything I can offer this person, a
