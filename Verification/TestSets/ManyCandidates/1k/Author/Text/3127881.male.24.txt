It's shitty because we care.
I leave for South Carolina Saturday morning to meet my family at Myrtle Beach. I'm actually driving down from Boston, and plan on making it down in a one day trip. You never know how these things will work out, especially driving on your own. Maybe I'll love it. Maybe I won't. Maybe I'll get arrested. Or maybe I'll fall asleep and drive into the ocean. Or maybe I'll get kidnapped by raging mutated inbreds while in the hills of some backwards state... alas, it only happens this way in the movies.  I can't wait to lay on a beach all day with Coronas and yell at women.   But I always feel wierd getting drinks with my parents around. They NEVER had drinks when we were growing up. So it still makes me feel out of place when I have a beer in front of them. I know, I'm old enough to do whatever, but somehow that doesn't apply. They are still parents. But who knows, maybe I can get my dad to have a few and open up about some things. I think there are some stories I'd never hear about otherwise; I just know he was an idiot, I just can't prove it.  If I ever have kids, will they wonder if I was an idiot kid? I think they'll know. This generation has so more access to pictures and videos than our parents did. Honestly, I've only seen a few pictures of my mom or dad from their teenage years or their twenties. So it's scary to think that my kids might get ahold of some of the drunken pictures I've got laying around, or even worse, videos I've made with friends (The Bears is a great example, even though you could never PROVE it was me. A New Years video, however, is a different story). Hey, maybe my parents did have these, but threw away the evidence. But I don't think so.  And think about how many pictures they have seen of THEIR parents from their younger years. It's barely a handful. And these pictures are usually very formal things, in suits, or in group pictures with the entire family. You'd never see them passed out drunk in a bathtub, or running around a bonfire with no clothes on. You know they did these things (or something like it), but they just didn't have access to recording their history like we do. So my parents had even less of an understanding of their parents than I have of mine.  And so I think we're all raising a different generation of kids right now, that have so much access to the past that they'll be able to find out almost anything they want about what's come before them. Obviously, there will be the school reports, the research of our current events (their history), which will be amazing because of how much they could know. But what happens when they decide to research their parents? And so what happens when your 12 year old kid sees pictures of the "Photo Shoot" that just happened to be shot without any clothes, or a website made for an ex-fiance? They'll understand us in a way we never understood our parents. I'm scared already.  Anyways, I'm just excited to drink beer on a beach.
I woke up last night passed out on my floor with porn on the computer screen staring back at me. I was still too drunk to feel pathetic, and too tired to care.  Otherwise, the night was great. Going out on a Tuesday and getting loaded isn't always an easy thing, especially when your boss decides to call you way too early in the morning to wake you up.   Sometimes what I love about life though, is that you can be almost incoherent and drunk one minute, then just 9 hours later find yourself walking around the city pretending to be a real grown up.  Dave and I met up with the drummer last night. It was perfect; she was perfect. I wasn't sure we could find what we needed, or if we even knew what that was. But she was great, and it should work out fine, as long as she can keep a beat, of course. We talked and drank, and when she left we had the inevitable conversation of having a threesome with her. We agreed that we would.  And so on my walk home I decided to call up a friend, his wife answered, and I ended up hitting on her and then randomly yelling words or phrases, my favorite being "sesame seed chicken". I'm afraid I can't remember much more than that.
I've been buying way too much music lately, and having people burn their CD's for me, and I just realized that's I've replaced any sort of relationship with a woman with music. But that's beside the point. Here are some recommendations, with songs below if you download stuff:  THE PIXIES- Doolittle download "Monkey Gone to Heaven" or anything, really  BUILT TO SPILL- Keep It Like a Secret. download "The Plan" or "You Were Right"  BRITISH SEA POWER- The Decline of British Sea Power. "Remember Me" or "Lately"  NICK CAVE AND THE BAD SEEDS "Red Right Hand" or "Lay Me Low"  INTERPOL-  Turn On the Bright Lights "Obstacle 1" or "NYC"  MODEST MOUSE- Good News for People Who Love Bad News "World at Large" or "Float On"  LORETTA LYNN- Van Lear Rose "Porland Oregan"  By the way, Loretta Lynn is an old gospel/country singer who just made an album with Jack White of the White Stripes producing and playing guitar. It sounds great. This is "real"  country music, bitches.
Does God or some form of god try to speak to people? Is there some sort of guiding spirit that actually send us messages? I'm not sure. But if there was, I'm convinced that today the message was sent through a 50 year old gay guy on the subway at 6:45 in the fucking morning. What was the message? Well, I d
