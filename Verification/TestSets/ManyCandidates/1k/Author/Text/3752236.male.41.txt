In conversation this afternoon, I came up with an off-hand comment that later struck me as being Spot.On. I was asked if I had watched any of the democrat's convention this week, and I responded with "No" and went on to explain that I wasn't going to waste my time watching the candidates who will be nothing more than a footnote in the history of American politics by the early morning hours of 3 November. The Kerry / Edwards ticket will be just another obscure answer to some vapid question in some trivia game that will be on the store shelves for the christmas rush.  From what I've seen / heard / read about the donks' convention, it was just more of the same topped off with a generous dollop of ".....and we're not GWB.....". As I opined recently over at  urlLink Supply Side Politics , hatred of the incumbent is not a viable campaign plank and you can't run based on who you're not. Eventually you have to step up and define who you are and what you stand for and spell out your vision. Which is exactly what the kerry / edwards campaign cannot do if they want to avoid political suicide. Go ask Walter Mondale, who openly supported higher taxes (hey, give Walt some points for being intellectually honest despite the price). If the voting public ever seriously paid attention to who the donks consider rich and taxable, the  Liberitarians  would come in second in November.  Who are the "rich" who would be called upon to fund a kerry / edwards budget? The democrats define a family of four with a household adjusted gross income over $42,600 as being rich. That's for a family of four. Do the math, people.  More on this later, I've got some research to do
urlLink James Lileks  hits the nail squarely on the head with his  urlLink Friday Bleat .&nbsp; Our kind of guy, with a view of theBig Picture  Never mind that it's only been Friday for 57 minutes now.
Go read  urlLink American Digest's  precious little gem.&nbsp; But be forewarned: set your drink down before you start reading.&nbsp; I might have to replace a semi-expensive monitor if the cheap rum and diet coke doesn't wipe off easily.   Jim at  urlLink Smoke on the Water  has again brought to the surface  urlLink a magnificent pearl .
My choices for entertainment this evening, after the&nbsp;family&nbsp;got bedded down,&nbsp;were numerous:     Watch the donks' convention  Break out the telescope and gaze at the Moon  Blog  Fix the kitchen chairs  Assemble the dresser for the baby's room  Re-organize the pantry  Fix the fridge's ice maker  Sit on the deck and drink copious quantities of rum   Number 1, watching the donks convention was right out, as I've heard it all before and I can't afford to break anything and the discharge of firearms is discouraged in this community.  Number 2 was out; while it's a rare clear night around here, it's also Garbage Night; so the hour I had for being outside got consumed with other endeavors.  Numbers 4, 5, 6, & 7 got shot down, as the rest of the family is sleeping and I shouldn't make any excessive noise.  Number 8 is not an option, as I can't in good conscience sit on my ass when there's so much yet to be done.  Fortunately; I found a happy alternative:&nbsp; blog and drink copious quantities of rum
Lance Armstrong  has won his  sixth    consecutive   Tour de france.   Bravo, Lance.   The details of the victory are here in  urlLink this post , interpreted as only the NewYork Times could:       The difference in cycling between five and six victories is enormous, whereas six to seven is just another statistic and could be interpreted as a way of rubbing in his superiority.   Just another statistic, my ass.&nbsp; *****WARNING:&nbsp;Political Non-Correctness moment coming*****&nbsp; "But  all  the kids should get trophies"&nbsp; "Keeping score may negatively affect some of the children's self esteem".&nbsp; Bullshit.&nbsp; Rub it in, Lance.&nbsp; Go on and win seven, eight, nine.&nbsp; Win , Win, Win.&nbsp; Rub in your superiority.&nbsp; You've earned it.&nbsp; Do what you do best, and keep kicking their asses for as long as&nbsp; you are able.   Just another statistic, my ass.&nbsp; The NewYork&nbsp;Times can bite me.
OK, so I'm late, you can collect your refund at the door.&nbsp; Likeks was again Spot.On. with his Friday bleat:    urlLink  Theyâ€™re like people who live in the same town where NASA has a tracking station, and think that it makes them all astronauts.   urlLink     He was talking about the 11 September commission and their report, along with some other stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp; Go fix yourself a drink and read it, an giggle along.  He's not watching "Bikini Destinations" for the same reasons I don't go to strip clubs or Porche dealerships.....  &nbsp;
I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't getting a chuckle out of  urlLink Lance Armstrong  mopping up the field in the Tour de france.&nbsp; Here's the premier event in france (name something bigger in france.....I didn't think so) and the entire cycling world is getting it's collective ass kicked by Lance Armstrong, American.&nbsp; For the sixth consecutive year.&nbsp; They should just go ahead and change the name to "Tour de Lance" and be done with it.   At the end of today's stage, our hero's lead is something like six and two / thirds minutes over the second place guy.&nbsp; The man in a fookin' machine; he smoked the field today, biking 34.18 miles in one hour, six minutes, and thirty-nine seconds. &nbsp;That's over 30 mph to you and me.   Wow.   I was on the (old and decrepit) mountain bike this evening, and rode about 10 miles in just over an hour and twenty minutes.&nbsp; I'm beat and my rump hasn't been this sore since the last time I rode the bike for over an hour, and I don't have to get up&nbsp;in the morning and ride over 100 miles to paris.&nbsp; Re-hydrating with a large jug of Ernest &amp; Julio Gallo's finest isn't going to help my cause.   Bravo, Lance.
