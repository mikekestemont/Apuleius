i am stuck on this track, going in circles. willingly, i keep myself here, making endless left hand turns into the same scenery. i see the exit, looming before me, telling me it's time to get off this road, but i falter and remain in place, choosing to stay stuck in this never ending game.   this is my road, my path that i have decided to travel. i can get off anytime i like, i have the strength. don't i?   i am never getting any closer or any further from my goal. the same five mile stretch of gravel cycles before my weary eyes. every now and then i spot a mirage, a slight change in the world around me, but as i get closer it moves away disappearing behind trees of cardboard and words without meaning.   alone in my car, tracy chapman wails, "baby just give me one reason" and that is all i ask. give me one reason to stay on this road. the next exit is closing in and time is short. it's now or never.
silence spills from screaming lips. acid falls from crying eyes splitting the face and  corroding the skin. lifeless hand wrench and wrangle. blood oozes from the tips of delicate fingernails being eaten by nervous teeth. feet dance, stricken and trembling, moving as if not attached to the body. lungs moan as they reach for breath. neck jerks in agreement to the conversations within. muscles twitch and shudder as suddenly the pain wrecks the entire body.  oh what woes this life can cause on the heart and spirit  of a child's mind.
psychedelic dreams in a black and white world. fingers reaching beyond what cannot be touched.  insanity for the sane. spinning backwards on my heels. trying to hold on as you fall away.   behind my eyes the lines have blurred. reality is no longer real imagination has taken flight.
Nothing ever stops No one stops to breathe. Life just pushes  Ever forward. No time to feel Don't even stop to think. Going and going Constantly trudging Against the forces of nature. This city laden in steel, High rises reaching for the clouds Built on the greed and loneliness That comes from that Constant and persistent Need for power and glory. This place -  A beacon for the mongers- Also houses the contrary As lovingly  As it embraces the wealth. The steel and concrete tower over, Taunting you to live here, Work here, BE here. All the while Cold and unphased By the weeping on its steps. The true city of the bi polar, Contrary contradiction of arrogance. Too beautiful to ignore Too unsettling to embrace. To watch it from the outside Is thrilling and spectacular, To exist and survive is a trudging And drudgery of swimming  In a cest-pool of discarded dreams. But the rain washes it all away, And out to the shore  Filled with medical waste The needles of the junkies The discarded butts  Of momentary relief. Around every corner is an addiction- Waiting to take hold Of you neck and pull you down Unto the filthy streets. The drugs, the booze, the sex The pure hunger for the extreme  The desire for the excess. We move in packs Never connecting  Avoiding eye contact Talking and never listening Always lost in the three  Inches in front of their existence Never seeing past their own Cluttered life. Unable to understand their happiness. Avoiding the past pitfalls. Grasping for an unattainable ideal. Refusal to be part of the pack. Separating themselves from  That which can make them feel. These are the dwellers Of this city of bright lights and loud noises. This place that never stops moving. Where time waits for no man And no man has patience for time.
i have kissed him  in the dark,  in the car, parked behind the building.   i have kissed him  when no one saw, when heads were turned, for a brief second behind the wall.   i have kissed him  at the beach, under the sun, when no one was looking.  i have kissed him  on the playground, on his lap,  wrapped in blankets and laughter.   i have kissed him everywhere,  hidden, cloaked and subversive.  i have kissed him passionately, with every inch of my soul.   i have kissed him and he has kissed me. we have shared moments of beauty  that were never meant to be.   i have seached and sought for embers hot as this,  only to be secretted and shuttered away.   i have hoped and dreamed for understanding such as this, only to be shrouded in lies and treachery.
voices squawk, bodies flock, they all greedily gather saddistic vultures in gowns.   from each painted lip obscenities slip and sturdy shoes crush delicate fingers.   they dance on this night, a celebration of plight, knowing that together they brought another one down.  left crying on the floor, unable to take anymore, they leave him with giggles as he trembles in pain.   left crying on the floor,  battered and shaken to the core, he knows he will never truly live again.   they dance on this night, a celebration of plight, knowing that together they brought another one down.
i remember in art school, a project was for us to take the mechanical wheel, go out into nature and without looking at what we were doing, create.  i took custody of my foot pedal potter's wheel and with a few friends went off for the weekend to my folk's property in north carolina. the land was completely undeveloped, meaning we had to crap in plasic bags, and we camped out from friday until sunday.   on saturday, we picked our respective spots on slope of the mountain, settled our equipment and stared at the majesty before us. we didn't play any music, we just listened to the sounds of the woods and the tempo of the  "swooosh, swooosh"  of the wheels.   the object of the lesson was to learn to trust your instincts. as art students, it taught us to believe in our passion and creativity. every peice every student submitted for g
