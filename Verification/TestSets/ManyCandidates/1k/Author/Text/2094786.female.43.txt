Fellow Logan Researchers,   This is some of the evidence that I have used to prove the children of James and Caroline Elizabeth (Hughes) Logan.  I also used the marriage records of some of the children for evidence of that relationship, but these articles, the marriage records and the pension application of James Logan are the best evidence I have found to date of the relationship of James and Caroline's children and his immigration into Kentucky.    There are some contradictions and omissions in these records and that is to be expected in genealogical research.     From History of Kentucky and Kentuckians: Biography of Daniel Boone Logan.    Daniel Boone Logan.  ----- Especially worthy of mention in a work of this character is Daniel Boone Logan, a gifted and well-known legist, now engaged in practice in Pineville, Bell county, Kentucky.  He is a native son, his birth having occurred April 23, 1858 in the country near Olive Hill, Carter county.  He comes from one of the old American families which in days gone by so securely laid the foundation of national independence.  The founder of the family on these shores was James Logan, great-grandfather of Daniel B.  He was the son of a Scotchman of the same name who emigrated from the old world about twenty years previous to the outbreak of the Revolutionary war, locating in the colony of Pennsylvania.  He found much to do in the new country besides winning a homestead from the wilderness in fighting the Indians for the Redskins at that time had not given up their claim to the state as their own hunting grounds.  He participated in the battle of Blue Licks, now in Nicholas county, Kentucky, and was severely wounded in the engagement.  Subsequently he located in that part of the state, in 1790, the section with which he was most familiar being now divided into Rowan, Fleming, Carter, Lewis and Boyd counties.  He took as his wife Caroline Elizabeth Hughes, a young woman of Keystone State stock.  They reared a family of fine sons and daughters, the sons being William, Moses, Abraham, Edward, and Tobias, the latter grandfather of Daniel Boone Logan; and the daughters were Julia, Susan, Sarah, and Elizabeth.  William Logan, the eldest son was among the early settlers on Triplett's Creek, as were called the waters of Licking River in that part of Fleming county out of which Rowan county was afterward formed.  There he resided all his life, being a well know citizen.  Moses, the second son, settled besides the head waters of  Kinnickonick Creek, a stream feeding the Ohio, in that part of Fleming county out of which Lewis county was afterward formed and there he continued to reside until his assassination by one Moses Burt about the year 1869.  He left a large family of sons and daughters, nearly all of whom are yet living within a few miles of their father's old home.  Abraham, the third son settled on what was then, and still is known as "Negro Hill," on the divide between Montgomery Creek and White Oak Creek, a tributary of Tygart's Creek in Lewis county, Kentucky, and there he lived until his death about the year 1900.  Edward, called "Ned" Logan, the fourth son, settled and lived all his life on Big White Oak Creek, near the home of his brother, "Abe" in what is now Greenup county, Kentucky.  He died about 1880.  Both left large families, who occupy the homesteads and adjacent farms.  Tobias, grandfather of the subject, was the fifth and youngest son of James Logan. He was born in 1796 at the mouth of Bull Fork  of Triplett's Creek, in what is now Rowan county and he married Polly A. Taber, daughter of Robert Taber, to their union having been born seven sons and two daughters.  They were as follows: James Fleming, father of the subject of this biographical record; Washington; Robert R.; Madison C.; Moses G.; Francis M.; Henry, Diana, who became the wife of Leander Markwell, and Elizabeth, who married Benjamin Hargett.  James Fleming Logan, father of the gentleman to who this review is dedicated, was born September 20, 1818, on Bull Fork of Triplett's Creek of Licking River, in what was then Fleming county and is now Rowan county.  He was a farmer and trader in live stock.  Like the majority of the young men of his day and generation he found it necessary to content himself with a limited education, his knowledge of teaching reading, writing and arithmetic to the "rule of 3" being gained behind a rule desk in the country school house.  In political conviction James Fleming Logan was a Whig in the earlier days and when the Civil War became a tragic reality, he enlisted as a volunteer soldier in the Union army, it being his from conviction that the integrity of the Union should be preserved at all costs.  He latterly was affiliated with the Democratic party and voted for McClellan for president in 1864 and for Seymour and Blair in 1868.  This good citizen was shot and wounded on March 17, 1869, by George (old George) and "Alf" Underwood, both horsetheives and criminals, and on Nov. 18, 1869, he died from the effect of his wounds at Rocky Ford, Tygart's Creek, in Greenup county, Kentucky.  On May 22, 1857, he married Nancy McGlone, daughter of William Owen McGlone and he and his bride located on a small farm on the Sugar Tree Fork, of Tygart's Creek, near his father home in Carter county, where Daniel B. Logan was born on the two hundred and ninety-fourth anniversary of the birth of Shakespeare.  The widow of James F. Logan, an admirable lady, now in her seventy-sixth year, resides near Morehead, in Rowan county, making her home with her son, Sebastian E. Logan.  Her grandfather, Owen McGlone, was a Scotchman, who settled in 1793 on Buffalo Fork of Tygart's Creek in what was then Fleming county and is now Carter county, Kentucky.  That pioneer citizen reared a large family of children, many of whose descendants reside on t
