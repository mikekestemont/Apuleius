ok well im posting..need to put a post it on my door reminding me i have a web page..actually wonder how many ppl look at it...haha. a friend once said that a blog is mainly just to vent about things, b/c it's like you're telling someone, but you're just expressing yourself while not having to make any apologies to anyone! up until 5 on friday morning doing 5 pg grapes of wrath essay and notes...turned it in...prob gonna have a "burn your essay" party at my house after we get them back! so after 3 cups of coffee, and listening to a kenny g cd at least 4 times, i was finished and ready for bed. its sunday night...friday just went to the IMPROV show with nicole...i didn't really enjoy it that much, but it was a little funny i guess! then, came home, and was supposed to take moms car to TP Jeremy Cooper b/c Laura is sick of him bashing her and mocking her, but they couldn't make it...then, in the spirit of the TP-ing mood, my house, Sarah's house, AND Jeremy W's (supposedly) house got TPd. id have to say that whoever TPd me was pretty dumb, b/c it took about 4 mins to clean up haha! so, going to TP whoever did it on friday night i hope..  went to the memorial on saturday for my little cousin. i was glad that i went, but upset that some ppl in our family didn't come...i was upset, b/c even though they may not have wanted to show up, they have a responsibility to my aunt and uncle and her boys, to support them! i dont like funerals/memorials, but if someone needs me, and im close to them, im gonna go! my mom consoled me by saying that the ppl that went were the ones that truly cared about her and her family, and the ones who didnt apparently aren't true to their word/suck big time. the ppl that she is close with and care about her most were there with her..and the entire church wound up being filled up! God Bless...
today we got our new car: GMC Denali...it's hecka nice, at least that's what i think...all that good stuff-- DVD player (got ordered), On-Star (car telephone, emergency, everything..), Navigation System, and all those other goodies. im excited, but still feeling a little shallow right now...i feel like after what happened yesterday, with my little cousin being a stillborn and all, that everything else means so much less and i should be thinking about more important things than just being superficial all the time. pray that my interview at hollister next tuesday goes well and i get the job...maybe i could have a chance to get to know Mike Shaddle a little better, and find out if he's really a christian (i believe that he is, at least that's what everyone else tells me). tomorrow, have to work on 5 pg term paper for "Grapes of Wrath"....ill be up until about 4 tomorrow probably. night...
i know i havent posted in a while, so forgive me. wow, so much has happened since thursday, and i dont know where to start. i got in a fight with my good friend over something really stupid that i regret, and it took us a week to make up...then, saturday, i spent the day at the beach with daniella, sarah, laura, karl, dan, and jeremy & jeremy. jeremy cooper and i had a great conversation all the way to Santa Cruz-Rio Del Mar beach, and i just love getting to know ppl better. it rained, so we went to tommy zefares' house...i knew his sister barbara (having fun in india babs?!?) this summer when we worked together. we came back to my house and watched "duplex" which was SO funny haha! then, sunday rolled around and it was church time, and i can't work on the newsletter anymore, so im like: ok, other than God, whats the point of being involved in church? i cant do anything anymore!! AHH!! but, yeah, monday (yesterday) i went to school for like 3 1/2 hrs b/c we have STAR testing this week (which im not taking), and our schedule is all wacked out...  today, at 8:30 this morning, my aunty teresa called and told us that my aunty angela's baby (she was in labor) died...something happened while he was inside the womb and he was born dead. our families are taking this tradgedy very hard, and we're not sure why the Lord let it happen. I remember when paul sharp passed last april...we didnt know what it meant at the time, but the tragic event brought many ppl to the Lord. God makes bad things happen for a reason, and though we may not understand it at the time, they're actually good things. my aunt would have loved and cared for that baby, and the Lord knows it, but we can have peace in the promise that the baby's in heaven now with the Lord Jesus Christ, and we'll see him again one day. in memory of the newborn, i'd like to dedicate today (his would be b-day)- April 20th, 2004- to him.
ok well although im posting on thursday morning at like 1:30 am, its for wednesday, k? so, i called up ariel and sarah this morning, and made fast plans, when we decided to go "real-golfing"...so, after like 5 minutes, they decided to go pee-wee golfing! haha me being 17, i havent done that since like my 11th birthday LoL! we had fun though. the girls are always talking about this hot guy named Mike Shaddle (hope i spelled it right haha), and how he dresses like me and he looks like a skinny me (thanx to everyone who said that). well, i guess we have the same nose and we do dress alike, but he's hotter than me..(sigh) if only pilates (pee-lawt-ees) worked faster =) so, anywayz, we go pee wee golfing, and everyone jumps in the cars, and we're supposed to pull the u
