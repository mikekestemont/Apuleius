So in this brief entry, I thought I'd share some interesting geographical and historical facts about Hawaii, the first stop of our conference.  You might be surprised to learn that the Hawaiian islands are a chain of underwater volcanoes, where the volcano tips stick out of the water. Here's an illustration of the island Kauai, so you can see how 95% of it is underwater.      Next is a picture of the whole volcano chain. If you look closely, you can see how the tips of certain underwater volcanoes stick out of the water, forming the islands.     And one more overview...      As for some basic history, Hawaii is a chain of South Pacific Islands that was originally discovered and inhabited by Polynesian explorers. Although no one knows exactly when these explorers got here, most estimates are around 500 AD.  In a second wave of exploration, the Tahitians (people of Tahiti) stumbled upon Hawaii and brought their royal hierarchy with them. As a result, for the next several hundred years, Hawaii's islands were ruled by Kings.  Captain Cook - the great explorer of the British Navy - showed up in Hawaii in 1778. Although he was later killed (and possibly even eaten) on the islands in 1779, Cook intiated the relationship between Hawaii and the West.   In 1835, sugar plantations started springing up all over Hawaii and by the end of the 19th century, US business men had overtaken much of Hawaii's land. Hawaii established its first constitution in 1840 and by 1848 feudalism was abolished. Beginning in 1850, foreign labors were hired from Asia and Europe - in particular China, Japan, the Phillipines and Portugal - to work on the booming sugar industry. These foreign laborers contributed to the islands' fabulous ethnic diversity.  In 1875, the US and Hawaii signed a Treaty of Reciprocity, but only 15 years later, the US annexed Hawaii depite dissent from Hawaiian residents.  In the early 20th century, Hawaii became a giant producer of pineapples, and today it supplies 1/3 of production around the world.  On December 7th, 1941, Pearl Harbor was fatefully attacked by the Imperial Army of Japan. The attack resulted in 2,500 American deaths and gave Japan a strategic edge in the war. The US declared war on Japan the next day.  In 1959, Hawaii became the 50th US State.
Welcome to my JASC blog where I will be sharing some pics, stories and thoughts for the coming month. Recently, I began my 30 days of travel with a 3 day visit to the Hawaiian island Kauai, which in short, is absolutely breathtaking. I begin with my arrival at my hostel-  [Upon arriving at my hostel in Kauai and greeting the owner]  Me:  "Wow. How does anyone get anything done around here?"  Hostel owner:  "Well, we dont."  Indeed the man spoke the truth. During my few days on Kauai, I witnessed (and experienced) the laid-back lifestyle that largely defines our 50th state (as of 1959), and found that though the residents of Kauai are not busy backsoons, they are happy, hospitable Americans who live very very well. Here's the view from my hostel-       Anyway, as for Kauai in particular, the island contains about 55,000 people, most of whom live in small town scattered along the West coast. The geography is stunning and lends itself well to movies, having been shot in both Jurassic Park and the less memorable Seven Days and Seven Nights.  I began my exploration of the island with a killer 1hr. helicopter tour. (Mom, I owe you for this one). Although I was hesitant to take the tour at first, I found it to be well worth the money since the helicopter affords unbelievable views of river valleys, canyons, and waterfalls that are otherwise unreachable by foot or car. If you don't believe me, check some of these pics I took from the air-                   Next, I explored the island on foot and by car, but mostly the latter. Since I was short on time, I only hit the main spots, which were Waimea Canyon, Kei'ei Beach and Wailua Falls. I list some pics below, but first I feel like I would like to introduce my hot rental car, Bertha. A 1989 Plymouth Sundance, Bertha got me where I needed to go without stalling too often. Here she is-    Isn't she pretty?  Anyway, here are some of the places she got me to...    Sunset from the first post of the Kalalau Trail    Wailua Falls    Wailua Falls (after hiking down to the bottom)    Swimming in the falls  Let's see...what else? In town, there is no metered parking, minimumn internet fees of $5, and a very very competitve gas price...ouch!     Here's a pic from the very cool coffee plantation I visited. The product, Kauai Coffee is available on the mainland, and if you're into flavored coffees, I think you'll dig it.     And a random mailbox in the middle of nowhere...    My current booklist consists of The Wisdom of Crowds (by James Surowiecki) and A Short History of Nearly Everything (by Bill Bryson). Both are great, but I am finding the former especially interesting...check it out if you are interested in group dynamics and the power of collective thought.  Anyway, that's it for the first post. Tomorrow I'm headed to Oahu where I will be meeting up with the other JASCers (the other 39 American delegates on my confererence). I promise to give more updates soon, as well as some background and history on the Hawaiian Islands.   Nite nite, Nick

Hey!  I'm back.  And I realize that I've been writing too much and showing too little. Thus, in this entry, I'd like to give my fingers a rest and instead whip out the photos I've been taking.   Anyway, without further ado...  HAWAII !
