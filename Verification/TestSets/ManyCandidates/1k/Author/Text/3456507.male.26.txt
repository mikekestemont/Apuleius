Current Price : 10.60  Target Price: 50 Target Period: 1Year  Stop Loss: 6    Point to be noted:   Reliance Group is going to Acquire this, Once Reliance Capital gets the license for banking. Reliance capital is already at 150 which is quite a stable line for it. But this script which is at 10 rs today will shoot to 50 rs. once activities get hot. This is expected in less than a years time.  Thanks, Saurabh-Max-Birla
Problem: When you partially select and modify column data in a datagrid in a Microsoft Visual C# .NET 2003 project, the changes may be lost when you move to a new row in the datagrid.But If you select and edit all the data in the column, the changes are retained when you move to the new row.  This issue occurs if the data is formatted in a custom numeric format such as currency or in a format that includes the comma symbol.  Solution: To work around this issue in Visual C# .NET 2003, override the PropertyDescriptor class to convert the text to a format that the base implementation can parse. After you determine the correct parse method, use this method in the Commit method: //Visual C# .NET  using System; using System.ComponentModel; using System.Windows.Forms; using System.Globalization; using System.Reflection;  namespace DataGrid_example { 	///   	///  Class that is used when column text is required in a custom numeric format 	///  such as a comma, or a currency. This class overloads the Commit method 	///  of DataGridTextBoxColumn. /// /// Refers to    private DataGrid_example.FormattingDataGridTextBoxColumn dataGridTextBoxColumn3;   	///   	public class FormattingDataGridTextBoxColumn : DataGridTextBoxColumn 	{ 		//Return object form Parse method. 		private MethodInfo localParseMethod;  		//Default constructor for class. 		public FormattingDataGridTextBoxColumn() : base() 		{ 		} 		 		//Default overloaded constructor for class. 		public FormattingDataGridTextBoxColumn( PropertyDescriptor prop, string format, bool isDefault) : base(prop, format, isDefault) 		{ 		} 	 		//Overiding the PropertyDescriptor class to covert text to  		//a format the base implementation can parse. 		public override PropertyDescriptor PropertyDescriptor 		{ 			set 			{ 				//Set the base value equal to the passed in value. 				base.PropertyDescriptor = value; 				 				this.localParseMethod = null; 				if(this.PropertyDescriptor != null) 				{ 					if( this.PropertyDescriptor.PropertyType != null) 					{	 						//Set method info for  						this.localParseMethod = this.PropertyDescriptor.PropertyType.GetMethod("Parse", new Type[]{typeof(string), typeof(NumberStyles), typeof(IFormatProvider)}); 					}  				} 			} 		}   		 		protected override bool Commit( CurrencyManager dataSource, int rowNum) 		{ 			if( null != this.localParseMethod ) 			{ 				try 				{ 					//Get the current value of the cell. 					object value = this.TextBox.Text;  					if(! NullText.Equals(value)) 					{ 						//Get the new value and format it as a number. 						value = this.localParseMethod.Invoke( null, new object[] { value, NumberStyles.Any, this.FormatInfo});  						//Set the value in the grid back to the raw number. 						this.TextBox.Text = value.ToString(); 					} 				} 				catch( Exception ){	} 			}  			//update the dataset 			return base.Commit( dataSource, rowNum); 		}  		 	} }   Comment: "Microsoft has confirmed that this is a bug in Microsoft C# .NET 2003"   Later, Saurabh-Max-Birla
Hi all, This is my first posting. I promise that I will always check my spellings and grammer before making any post !!.. ;)   Hope I will keep this blog useful to all.  The only way to get this most desirable email ever is to become be a google employee.

Yes. It has come. I don't really know much about this technology but this is going to be the in thing in near future this I foresee.  Using this technology two electronic devices can intract just by touching each other. So imagine buying a movie ticket and the ticket will be downloaded to your mobile. :) And when your mobile phone touches your girlfriends mobile phone the phone will shout... "Oouch" !!.. ;) or may be if you want to configure it to "Let's Do it" then its your wish !! ;)  I will keep this blog posted with the latest updates on this Tech. To know more keep visiting.
You install Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2002 and Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003 on your computer, and then you remove Visual Studio .NET 2002. If you create a macro that retrieves the References collection for a project by using the VSProject object, and then you run the macro, you receive the following error message: Interface not registered  This error occurs when you remove Visual Studio .NET 2002 from your computer. When you do this, the References interface in the VSLangProj library is unregistered.   To work around this problem, repair or reinstall Visual Studio .NET 2003. To do this, follow these steps:  	Do one of the following, depending on your operating system:  *	Microsoft Windows 2000  In Control Panel, double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon. The Add/Remove Programs dialog box appears.  *	Microsoft Windows XP or Microsoft Windows Server 2003 In Control Panel, double-click the Add or Remove Programs icon. The Add or Remove Programs dialog box appears. 	In the list of programs, click the Visual Studio .NET 2003 program, and then click Change/Remove.  	In the Microsoft Visual Studio .NET Setup dialog box, click Visual Studio .NET.  	In the Microsoft Visual Studio .NET Maintenance dialog box, click Repair/Reinstall.  Microsoft has confirmed that this is a bug in the Microsoft products that are listed in the "Applies to" section.    Steps to reproduce the behavior  *	Install Visual Studio .NET 2002 on your computer.  *	Install Visual Studio .NET 2003.  *	After the installation process is complete, remove Visual Studio .NET 2002.  *	Start Visual Studio .NET 2003.  *	On the View menu, point to Other Windows, and then click Macro Explorer.  *	In Macro Explorer, right-click Macros, and then click New Macro Project. The New Macro Project dialog box appears.  *	In the Name box, type ReferencesObject, and then click Open.  *	Under the ReferencesObject node in Macro Explorer, double-click the Module1 node. The code editor of the Module1 module opens.  *	In the Module1 module, replace the existing code with the following code: 		Imports VSLangProj 		Imports EnvDTE 		Imports System.Diagnostics 		Public Module Module1 		    Sub References() 		        'Retrieve the VSProject object. 		        Dim proj As Project = DTE.Solution.Projects.Item(1) 		        Dim vsproj As VSProject = CType(proj.Object, VSProject) 		        '
