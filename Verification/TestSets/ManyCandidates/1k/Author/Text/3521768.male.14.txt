La Gioconda, or, the Mona Lisa. Painted by Leonardo DaVinci of the young wife of a merchant. Its painted on a thin sliver of wood, and, is admired by most all people to be considered an extraordinary painting. Her smile is unconsistent with paintings of the period, which makes it stand out. The way the folded hands make a triangle with the body is stunning.   The history of the Mona Lisa is interesting. DaVinci was asked to paint the wife of a merchant, and, it took him over four years to complete it, but, never gave it to the merchant. He took it with him to France, where it traveled from King Francis I. to the Louvre to Napoleon, then back to the Louvre. It was stolen, brought to Italy, sold, and then returned to the Louvre again. In 1956, they attempted an acid procedure on it, which damaged much of the lower half of the painting, but, was saved by many years of restoration. It now sits in the Louvre, unable to leave again.
Welcome to Noodle Soup. I started a blog, not to long ago, called  urlLink Alphabet Soup . It is a group story writing blog. Well, this is it's newly founded sister blog, Noodle Soup.  The main purpose of this blog? Essay writing. Alot like www.everything2.com . But our goal is improving our writing ablity, whereas their goal is sharing knowledge, and writing really neat stuff. So, obviously you're not going to be reading this blog for good writers.  So, the name.. yeah, I had trouble with that one. My description of it? Alphabet soup, the blog for fictional stories, is a letter soup. You can arrange the letters however you want. The sister blog, which deals with essays, is non-fictional stuff, just a presentation of information. Noodles can be bent and stuff, and presented differently, but they are still the same noodle, the same info.  Wether or not people actually pick up on that, well, that's their problem. If someone has a better title, please tell me.
Devon used to be a fairly athletic guy, always running around, doing sports. He wasn't the best, but, he definitely wasn't the worst. But in time, he matured and became somewhat of a nerd. He was always on his computer, his brother gave it to him once he moved out and got a better one, so it wasn't a great computer. His friends, few friends, described it as 'ancient.' His life wasn't all that boring until one day...so he thought.  Devon was at his little computer, typing away for a research project for his college history class. He was writing a 10 page essay over the Revolutionary War. It was due tomorrow  and he was only on the 7th page. To make matters worse, he was really stressing out and when he looked at the clock it read: 2:16 AM.  "Crap, why did I wait so long to do this! Prof. Neits assigned it a week ago, and I blew it off until three days before." He sighed. He finished the sentence he was typing and leaned back in his comfy chair, his only escape from the major pressure, with his arms behind his head. The screen flashed black then a greenish blue screen popped up.   "Oh my God! What happened to my report!!" he screamed as he slapped the computer hoping it might help.  It flashed white then blue again and typed out the message:  "m-th-r k-dn-pp-d. -ddr-ss = time, r-ck p-th."  "What is that supposed to mean? It's in some sort of code, or something...Wait a minute, there aren't any vowels! Except in time. I wonder why.." Devon questioned. "Hmm...maybe the dashes took place of certain vowels?? M-_-T-H-_-R..Hmmm, M-A, nah. M-E? nope...M-I!...no..M-O! M-O-T-H-E-R...Mother?! What about her!!" He screamed, as if it were a living person.  Devon spent hours, it seemed, trying to crack the rest of the message. So far he had Mother kidnapped. Address = time rock path. He still was unsure what the time was for. Eventually, the remembered it was 2:16 when this message came up.  "216 Rock Path? That's not an address anywhere near here." wondered Devon. "What addresses do I know of that have a 216 in their address.."  After about 10 minutes of thinking, he finally had it.  "216 Rock Path stands for 216 Stoney Road! It's only a few blocks from here!" he shouted "But why would my mom be at the library? Oh well, I better go look for her."  For some unknown reason, he got up, tossed his bag over his shoulder, and headed out the door.  "What the-!" exclaimed Devon as he peered around outside. It was daylight. "How is this possible?! My computer said 2:16!"  He decided it didn't matter seeing as he had to get to his mother's aid. Then, he realized that his mom was here, in New York. When she lived in Kansas.  "Wait a minute. How can she be here?" asked Devon, as if there was some all-knowing guru right next to him. "No time though, I must get to her."  He trekked on and eventually reached the library. It seemed to be standing unusually taller than normal but he ignored it.  "216 Stoney Road. This is it" he said. As he walked into the library.   There was a spiral staircase. He walked up to it, looked upwards, only to see it going up very high. Too high He saw the ceiling and figured his mother might be there seeing as she wasn't on the first floor. He started hiking up the staircase getting nearer to the ceiling, and to his mom. He was looking up the whole time but, when he looked down, he appeared to be on the third step still. This threw his equilibruim off and he stumbled. But, the ceiling wasn't any further away than when it was a second ago. He got up and started up the stairs once again. After hours, it seemed, he finally go to the top. He peered over the edge of the floor a
