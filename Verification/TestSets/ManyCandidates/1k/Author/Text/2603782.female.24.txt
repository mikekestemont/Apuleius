It's been too long...  ... since I've last added an entry, so this one has to sum up a whole-lotta-shiat and I'm going to try and make it short.      Pic of David Alan's   I have to start off with mentioning the new lunch 'hot-spot'. It's a place called David Alan's. It's in East Hanover, I believe, or at least, somewhere near there.  It has all sorts of gourmet food, and it's just so damn good! My fav is the Sante Fe Chicken Salad wrap with lettuce and a bottle of water. Mmm  Mmm Good!  This past Friday I headed over to  urlLink Vanderbilts  in Florham Park, to see a band called   urlLink The Nerds  play, and also to enjoy a few drinks with my co-workers.       Nerdy lead singer    Nerdy guitar player    Ok, so the place was packed, and was totally not what I expected, which is definitely a good thing  . Here's a few pics with me from the night.       Rachel and me    Juan and me.         Ron, Me and Alicia    Ron, Patty, Alicia and Me    Soooo....after getting a lil tipsy, I decided it would be fun to test my motor skills with a little foosball action:             Juan and Me vs. Rachel and Kevin     Needless to say, I did not do all that well, considering I scored at least 6 points for the other team. MY BAD YO! After a bit of dancing, screaming, sweating, drinking & foosballing, we needed to munch on some grindage. [Thanks for that one, Pauly] So we were off to the nearest diner. To give you an idea of how 'slow' the night was at about 12 am, here are some pics.       a turn we took at about 100mph [a little exaggeration there]    just to remind Ali where the hazards are.         what the diner looked like to us, from the road,  i think we were a little sideways      So that was Friday, now for Saturday...dun dun dunnnn. Went to Rhythm and Brews in Pequannock to see  urlLink Stir Crazy  perform. The bar was kinda freaky at first, [i'm not all that used to the 'bar scene', though], but we saw this POSTER of ALI with the "Impossible is Nothing" slogan on it, it's funny because that is what is being posted around our office. How ironic to find it at this bar, so...we took a pic for proof of our findings:      PROOF!!    Anyway, at this 'bar', I finally realized how short I really am, and decided I just HAD to do something about it, so...I stood on the 'step' near the bar, and held on to some random ABC'd gum under the bar counter and made myself tall:      Will, Me and Ken. I'm standing on a step and they are bending down,  how sadly short I be, man.    The only thing I realized from being tall, is that I could see alot more bald spots and a hell of a lot of cleavage. I think I'll leave the height advantage to the guys    The night was long, maybe too long because of the previous night of "oh so much fun" .... and it was just so much fun, I had to leave some things out of this entry. Just looking forward to what this coming Friday will bring. Muuuhahahahaha!
So, Um...yeah
A day in NYC...Woo Hoo!        Rachel, Alicia and Me.    Saturday, was quite a day, such a day...that I slept until 5:30pm today!! Ok, so I'm totally not used to this. I haven't partied or 'chilled' since I was 18! Not like this at least. [All good clean fun though =)] Here's some people we met along the way ;-)        Alicia and me with NSync.    Yeah, these boys were a bit oily and all, I mean...c'mon now, you have millions of people putting their hands all over your face, your bound to get a bit 'shiny'. Ok...also met the president, he was very quiet and kept immitating me for some reason. What's up with that??       Me and GWBush     All in all, we had an awesome time, even got to pass by a few places where we had some good times on NYE:             Ah, memories, sad how all things must come to an end...aww..that sounds depressing.  But hey, It's all good, 'cause, I met someone new...and here we are together:      His name is Doo.     Anyway, at the end of the day, we were still happy as can be and had a blast, who could ask for anything more?!      Rachel, Alicia and Me....again
=          Hmmm...  What do the 2 pictures above have in common??? Well, lemme tell ya.... The same guy took both pictures and was aiming for the same pose each time.   Alright...So maybe you had to be there.  If you're looking at the picture above and thinking, "Damn, that guy sure is fine." well, HELL YEAH, you're right he is. The pic is of: [from bottom to top] Alicia, Me and  urlLink Gavin DeGraw . Thas right yo, Gaaaah-Vin Dah-Grahw. Ever see  urlLink One Tree Hill ? Well, Gavin DeGraw is the man/group that sings the main song, and others, for that show. He was one of the 'openers' at the  urlLink Barenaked Ladies  concert that we went to last night.  [Which I must say was friggen awesome, more crazy pics to come  ]  Here's something new, Alicia  [blonde chickie above]  is actually going to be hosting her new blog on here!!  urlLink Click here  to check it out.  Ok, here's a list of events that happened last night: On the way to and from the concert, I drove....Let's just say, it was quite an adventure. I didn't know the roads all that well down there, and all those sharp @$$ turns that usually have those yellow arrow sign thingies that usually represent "slow down, sharp @$$ turn ahead", well...those turns didn't have any signs, so I took them hard at about 60 mph with 3 other passengers in my car. And well, you'd think I'd learn my lesson the first 3 turns I took like that, but...unh uh, NOPE...took about another 4 or so more that night, even p
