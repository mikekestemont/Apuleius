It always comes back to the raindrop that dries up the sea.   it can fill up your latest thought  and top up your cup of tea  the pure clear raindrop  falls aerodynamic and fast  from the darkest cloud and soaks the brown grass  slowly the blades go green again and the smell is familiar like the sqeaking tap in your sink or it's drip drip drip that bewilders  it always comes back to the raindrop that soaks my baseball mit it makes me think of the last time it was all ok to get wet  I think I'll take a walk to today and hope for clouds real dark It always comes back to my raindrop Let's go for a walk in the park
I was near someone in the frat party in 1992 who had lost the plot. pissing on his shoes and laces standing in brown gas burnt and layered tight on the cement with water, and this a black below the brown that felt his urine lapping at its back and ears trying to disperse its busy bee  in desperation that was fading  rain and sweat mixing in his brow finally even in a basement with one light and grimacing with vaseline tears gluing down his face into a cake of five percent and purple cow and thirty-nine chin hairs talking of glory and  slamming its fists over and over hoping to flap wings to deliver him to his iron horse ticket and the letter A
my latest thought was about the moon it goes so that we say the moon is half it also goes so we say of the moon quarter mistaken. it's mistaken. miss taken. the half moon is the quarter moon why we blink so long for the side dark? as such, there is no 'full moon' as we see it but we do know it. you do.
"the ranta of the gallows in hunger that swallows the rightous who yell and scream  the belief of thee wild oats sown free I catch just a silver of the shadow  you have gone thee like a nightengale with song to the south where it feelis like heaven  crescendo and passion is for you your fashion take it now for tomorrow it could be gone  dichotomies can exist subsumed and persist along lines of duty and age  it was night I thee tell when the light it did fell on the cheeks of my most brazen of loves  tender fodder of toddler as she tomward me did I saw her and into my arms she did embrace  cherub of my blood her joy it does me flood sheechless, as a father I am amazed" -Fellsy, 2004
Yes. As title.
182.30 gets me a ticket to infinite intimacy  across an expanse,  no expense.  Across the high interior plains  that look like cereal bowls  filled with wheat germ  blanketing the last few sales of the sunset  leaving me  to work the margins  to find myself.  taking the train  from one place to another.  things are still the same  unless of course,  you buy your ticket  while you are sleeping,  dreaming of breakfast.

Nothing stays new like, for example the moment  just past it was new, but not now it jumped forward  to miss smashing my specs (they had fallen to the floor) I gounded them.  This is always the way They start new  like a sprout or a car wash or a slope or a breath or the edge of your bed or space invaders  Anything new will slide away down to the old how long can you hold on  to all that is new?  Not [-------------------------------------]  Long.                            This is why nothing stays new  The first sign  you can see of age comes only when you  have a scratch  on your glasses and see time watching you slide down

The Brain once spoke:   "I believe you  that you had  the worlds most amazing dream,  few would. I too dream... I was living on the moon.  and I couldn't breath.  I had gills.  I had slit them in my throat.   It was beautiful nonetheless,  I was so very content.  Very ironic.  The sky was purple.  I was upset because I woke up."  I reply, "Gills."  Continuing, the Brain says,  "You don't say much in your pictures.  I may just like you best silent and unmoving."  Can one resist speaking with The Brain?  I had the worlds most amazing dream  just the other day - so real I built a space ship.   a 'flying saucer' and went into space ailerons everywhere they made sense to let it fly  I had to come back to earth  only now, solo, and in my shirt  a green shirt  made o
