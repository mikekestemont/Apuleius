So I have been a beach lover all my life. Despite the rather excruciating pain in my tooth, I was game for a day at the beach. Knowing K and his (sometimes irritating) eye to detail we got all packed and all for a casual day at the beach with his friend. And what happens? It rains on our parade!  We left late. Ok, my fault. But I do happen to think that speaking with my mom is marginally more important. And when we finally reached we had a rather long drive to the beach. Getting down from the car, I nearly froze my a** off but K and his friend decided we should go for a walk. Not a bad idea but it was so windy, and after walking for what felt like miles against the wind, I felt like calling it a day. So we get in the car again. Going to lunch, my travel sickness decided to put in an appearance, so I spent half the journey on my cellphone talking with my friend, with my head between my knees, so as to distract myself from the rather "uprising" sensation in my throat.  Lunch was a grand affair and one of the highlights I considered for the day. After that scrumptious experience (despite the tooth), we decided to go to the friend's place, during which time I blissfully took a short nap.  Blah blah blah, the rest of the day was uneventful. oh I should mention for dessert what I had was a cake, warm from the oven with rich chocolate sauce and vanilla ice-cream on top. That truly was the main event of the day. The sea was a washout. The journey to and fro was nice and comfy with me and my babe, not squabbling for a change but nice and snuggly instead. comme ci, comme ca. That's what the day was like...
Last night, I developed a pain in my newly emerging wisdom tooth. I took a pain killer, but it offered just temporary relief. But this morning I was game anyway for my day at Central Park. I didn't expect much out of it, hey a Park is a park right?  no way is Central Park just a Park. I walked and I walked till my legs felt like they were going to drop off but I just wanted to go on anyway. I went to the zoo, to the fountain and here and there and still managed to see just half of it. I have got to go again!  Did I mention K was there too? Well he was and I had the most wonderful time because of him. Well he did manage to bug me with his penchant for taking the best photographs. I mean shouldn't I get a better view since I am on the scene rather than move so that he can stand and capture the moment on film rather than me in my mind? But maybe in retrospect- his memories might last longer than mine. zoos are a lot of fun and I remember the last time I went to a good one was about 12 years ago when I lived in Hyderabad. My mom used to tell me the monkeys missed me when I didn't visit there in some time. But I loved it and I cant believe how many memories that Central Park zoo brought back. The reptile house, the bird smell, even the stupid monkeys! All that was missing was the smell of those god awful greasy smashes that I insisted on eating there. What keeps the animal couples together? Perhaps a certain sense of attachment, a certain instinctive knowledge that things are right. What keeps human beings from having that same knowledge? Is it that our instincts have been misted by our learning of 'civilized' behavior? I really cant say but its clear that we cant ever truly say honestly that is that this is "right" and be absolutely certain. Reason always pokes up its voice and says "are you sure?" and you know what? You never are...
I see its been a couple of days since I last wrote. Not that I forgot or anything, just that I have either been occupied or occupied. Saturday I finally went to the Indian area around this place. Funny how us Indians a colonized race have managed to make our own colony here. Kind of ironic even. The street is a wierd mix. Its a bit like one of the lower middle class areas to shop back in India and yet the crowd is a strange one comprised of those that would be at the places where I shopped. The clear cut class difference vanishes in a country like this I guess. You tend to lust after stuff that back in India you probably might not even have thought twice about. Who would have thought I could become mad about Indian groceries and Hindi movies after leaving India when I wouldn't even glance at them back in India?! That's the strangest part. But then I can say that back in India K and I didn't so much as glance at each other in 'that' way either.  I guess you begin to look at things differently when you don't have them anymore, when u have to stop taking things for granted. Perhaps then, those are the times when you would stop being blind and actually begin to see things that were right in front of your face, the whole time.
I wake up this morning to find that I couldn't see the next building too clearly, and no I wasn't going blind, but it was very very foggy outside. Being at my boyfriend's house, one has a clear view of Manhattan. But this morning, it was obscured by all that smog. I finally saw him off to work (ok so he went reluctantly but I assure you I did not have anything to do with his reluctance!) and got down to the serious business of chatting online with my mother.  A
