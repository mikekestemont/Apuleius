jeepers creepers...    bad:  watching  urlLink a really awful horror movie  with your boyfriend on a friday night.   worse:  discovering that the really awful horror movie has  urlLink a sequel  coming out in august. and your boyfriend really, really wants to see it.
there is a baby robin perched on a branch outside my window here at work. it is obvious that baby has not yet learned to fly. it's also obvious that baby had better figure out how, because it's a third-floor drop down to the ground. i have a feeling i'm going to be keeping an eye on baby bird all day.   update:  after some poking and prodding by mamma bird, baby bird is hopping and fluttering around all the branches, getting the hang of it. baby will be ok. yay!
right now, i feel like everyone has just given up on me.
it's very, very sad that i am working late right now because i don't want to go home and lift weights.  perhaps moving up to the 15 pounder was a bad idea, after all.
today, when the tampon machine in the office bathroom spit out my 25-cent tampon, it also accidentally spit back out my 25 cents, causing me to giggle with glee, because there's no "sold out" indicator, and that machine has stolen  so many  quarters from me in the past, i feel completely vindicated.
on his first day (today), my new assistant:  a. wore a tie  b. covered his desk with pictures of his daughter  c. brought in a 64 ounce pepsi drink mug  d. all of the above   if you guessed "all of the above", you are correct!
before  bruce almighty  (worst movie ever) yesterday, there was a preview for  pirates of the carribean  (side note: orlando bloom, still very hot), after which i turned to the boy and said, "that movie's rated ARRRR!"
date night highlights   --sunlight and warm weather: made cameo appearances  --missing: my dart skill. (if found, please return a.s.a.p., as i am tired of receiving dart beatdowns from the boy)  --shots of soco: well, more of a lowlight  --being certain that was brian engbloom over there: probably not a good sign  --harassing teenagers: they'll remember it a lot longer than we do  --the boy flipping off said teenagers as we drove away: completely unnecessary, yet utterly hilarious  --one teenager's "is that your i.q. or your sperm count?" comeback to the boy's extended middle finger: initiated a long discussion about what constitutes a high sperm count  --$60 bar tabs for two people: getting a little extreme  --state blowjob champions: scheduled to go head-to-head  --waking up at 4 a.m. on top of the covers next to a naked calico cat: strange  --the boy wandering into the bedroom at 4:02 a.m. and explaining that he had just woken up on the couch: even more strange  --wondering, "did we get into a fight?": not implausible, but quite unlikely  --saying gay things about "the landscape": humiliating  --being very, very, very late for work: worth it  --arriving at work and learning that i won't have to work all weekend: possibly the best news ever  --writing posts like i'm a credit card commercial: getting old   edit: highlights i overlooked:   --"i want to go running with you some night, late."  and  --"sometimes i feel really lucky that i'm dating a girl who knows what a tauntaun is."
i really hope everyone realizes that everything that goes on at  urlLink enemyster  is a big silly joke. i'm sort of glad  urlLink rob  booted me; now i can get back to work.
--i hate it when, at the last minute, i decide i don't like the pants i was planning to wear to work, so i shift into another pair, leaving my lip gloss and, more important, my lunch money, in the original pants.  --i request "working in the coalmine" by devo almost  every day  on  urlLink thepAvedearth . i'm not ashamed.  --date night tonight: a visit to 'the inn'--a rundown old shack with amazing hot dogs and waitresses who get holy-hell pissed if you don't know what beers are on tap. you suffer the humiliation because the beer is so cheap.  --i want to go back to vegas. soon.  --my brother gets married next weekend. i drew maid of honor duties. i've been told that the "something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue" fulfillment is on me. i've got everything covered except something borrowed, as i have no antique or fancy jewelry to lend. any ideas?  --today i learned that it's not nice to tell some people you're back online while not telling others. so, if i forgot to tell anyone, it wasn't personal. i'm not like  some people . (IA, you know who you are.)
shhhhh...   don't tell my bastard of a boss...i just submitted a resume and cover letter for an open position at  urlLink npr . it's kind of like the time i tried to get a job at  urlLink expn --completely impossible but well worth a few daydreams. it's out in the ether now...
say my name   i've always thought it was weird how radio stations make callers--those making a request or winning a contest or just chatting--say their call letters.  it goes something like this:  dj: what station gives you the best music  and  the most free concert tickets? caller: 98.5XYZ!!  and, i always think,  what if  the caller forgot the call letters? or said the call letters of a  different  station (entirely possible since clear channel owns everything and every corporate station is pretty much the same)? or said something entirely off the wall, like "free pancakes at the jiffy lube!"? what if?  i realize it's free advertising and name repetition equals recognition and all that, but to me, it always seemed threatening and somewhat sexual, like the dj should just scream "what's my name, bitch!?" instead of asking the corny leading question.
it's good to be back.  if you want to know where i went, you can start  urlLink here .  there are some obvious glitches that i'll be working on during the next few days; let me know if you s
