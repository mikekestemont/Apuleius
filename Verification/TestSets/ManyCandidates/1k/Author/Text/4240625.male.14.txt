Personality Heero is very hard to fathom when it comes to his personality. At the start of the series, he seems very cold, unemotional, suicidal, anti-social, and totally dedicated to his mission. Nothing will get in his way and survive. But as Docter J once said, "he's really a kind-hearted young boy." But he never lets it show, except for small, rare, subtle hints. He has also taken a strong hold on the last piece of advice given to him by his father-figure, Odin Lowe. "Do as your heart tells you. That's the right path.." This is what Heero later passes on to Trowa: "Do as your heat tells you."* A very important and key line to the gentler pysche of Codename Heero Yuy. Later on in the series, Heero starts a slow but undeniable and astounding change in character. He reacts to people in a more understanding manner, even though Relena still confuses him at times. This change seems to start around the time he self-destructs in Siberia; after recovering, Heero seems 'born again'. He sees life as holding perhaps a bit more meaning. Although he still considers his own life to be devoid of meaning for quite some time. His slightly more social and caring attitude comes through in forms such as his later-on devotion to looking after Relena, less caustic nature (still not saying much) around the other pilots, like Duo, and his gentle-yet-firm 'coaching' of Quatre into leading the Gundams at the final series of battles with the ZERO System.Finally, at the end of the series, Heero screams out that he will survive this fight. An amazing revelation, considering he has, since BEFORE he came to Earth, been trying to seek death. What an amazing 180° turn. In the run-in covered * I'm referring to the line "Follow your emotions." That line is NOT the true translation; just another anime dub blooper. The original line is much closer to "Do as your heart tells you." Psychologically speaking, there IS a difference. Pre-AC 195 History With nary even a name to be called for his childhood, the boy who would be Heero Yuy remains a mystery. The earliest back we know of him is A.C. 188, when Heero is 8 years old. At this time he was in the care of an assassin of no small amount of infamy, Odin Lowe, killer of the first Heero Yuy. How Heero came to be under Odin Lowe's wing, it's uncertain, but it's apparent that Odin had raised Heero from a very early age — teaching the boy to wield a gun during a camping trip (on Earth?) when Heero was scarce past being a toddler — 4 or 5 years old, perhaps.Odin's treatment of Heero, while being somewhat gruff and detached, was very much fatherly; perhaps a means of atonement for his crimes, though he still raised the boy with the qualities and skills of a professional assassin. Still, there's no proof that he even had a name for Heero throughout the years he watched over the boy. The fandom rumor that Heero is actually Odin Lowe Junior has no basis in reality. (Well, Episode Zero reality... of course Gundam Wing's real, you idiots! ... ::sweatdrop::) When Heero was 8, he parted ways with Odin Lowe as the man was killed during his last assassination attempt and means of atonement. After a somewhat sentimental last few words, Heero left Odin's corpse behind in the burning Alliance base and walked out into the rain. Some time later, after somehow getting a hold of what would become his trademark tanktop and spandex outfit, nameless little Heero happened across an old man huddled in an alleyway; Dr. J. The doctor casually remarked that Heero had good eyes; would he mind becoming a Gundam pilot? Remembering Odin's parting advice, to do as your heart tells you, Heero agreed.Heero's training from that point on remains a mystery. (ALL DATA IN THIS SECTION IS FROM RELENA'S EPISODE ZERO. IT IS STRONGLY HINTED THAT HEERO IS INDEED THE NAMELESS LITTLE BOY THAT RELENA HAPPENS ACROSS. IN THE OFFICIAL TRANSLATION, IT'S SAID THAT THERE IS NO RECORD OF HEERO EVER HAVING BEEN ON EARTH BEFORE OPERATION METEOR. WELL, WHY WOULD THERE BE RECORD? HE WAS NAMELESS and PART OF AN UNDERGROUND TERRORIST ASSOCIATION!)Three years after happening across Dr. J, 11 year old Heero — currently codename Black Alpha — was sent to the J
