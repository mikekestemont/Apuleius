Everyone remembers the 'faked-orgasm-in-a-deli' sequence from your kind of movie When Harry Met Sally. It seems that you're falling for a buddy or have already fallen for them. Uh-oh. You're probably caught between the possibility of having a great relationship and wrecking the one you have now. You know what they say, it's better to regret something you did than something you didn't do.    urlLink   What Romance Movie Best Represents Your Love Life?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

Quit Leaking DAMN YOU   You know what noses suck. Especially when you have a cold and no matter what you do they leak and leak and leak and leak. It's a very unattractive quality when the leak goes out of your body and nasty when it tries to retract itself into the back of your throat. And no matter what you do you can get it to stop leaking. You could stuff tissue up your nose and yet some how the liquid finds its way out or soaks the tissue to the point where it pushes it out. Then you take a bunch of cold medicine thinking that will help your nose b/c if I was a nose and leaking as much as mine is I would be tired of it. But no taking that medicine was a mistake because IT MADE IT LEAK MORE.  DAMN THE INVENTOR OF COLDS!!!!!!!
Just a Thought   Today at my school during the last period they had this festival celebration thingy for the renaissance card holders (some gay program that makes those of us who don't have it feel stupid) and me and a couple of my friends were "left behind."  Michel and I were talking about random stupid things and some how we get on the subject of short buses. And here's that conversation: Emily- I've always wanted to own a short bus I think that would be so great! Michel- you know what I wonder about short buses? Emily- What's that? Michel- Why the numbers are like 6 digits. Emily- (confused) Um ok? Michel- No I mean like mostly EC kids ride those buses and most of them can't remember anything so how in the hell are they going to remember 6 digits for a damn bus. Emily- Yeah it's like the number is longer than the bus!!!  (LOTS OF LAUGHTER even from the teacher)  Best quote ever from a teacher- Emily you spell masturbation with a 'u' not an 'e' I think I would know.
3.62 3.62 3.62 woo woo and buses   Yes that is my GPA. Which I am insanely proud of. Most people that are my friends and are in the really upper scale classes are like "Well I got a 4 or above." And I'm like "Well I could care less this is the best I've done in my entire school career." And run off giggling. Today was a good day. I was really happy about all my grades. Now maybe I could drive to school and not have to wait on this old fart woman who drives my bus. I wouldn't have to wait for a woman who waits until the entire bus parking lot is clear so she can turn the bus on. *eye twitches* It's really retarded like.  I said to my friend Hayley and also fellow sufferer of the damn bus driver while staring at the woman "I can not wait to drive to school THEN I CAN LEAVE WHEN I EVER I DAMN WELL PLEASE." *angelic Simpson like music plays in the back ground* Yes I have issues. I know this leave me the hell alone. Oh I'm in such a good mood. Well I'm going to go eat pizza and go see my boyfriend. YAY!

Hello, peoples. This is Nick McIntyre testing out the Blog he made for Emily Green
A week ago   A week ago I had my son. A month early. It was so frightening I thought he might not live through the night. But he did. He's so strong to be so tiny. You never really understand was absolute true love is until your very first child is placed in your arms and you see that tiny life sleeping. It was so hard to let him go but  I know what I did was right and I know that the family that has him will give him all that love and t
