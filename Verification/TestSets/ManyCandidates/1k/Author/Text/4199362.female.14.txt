Well for starters if you can't tell I'm a Harry Potter freak. I've read all the books at least ten times (except for the fifth, I've only read it twice, it's not my favorite) I also have a lot of the extra books such as: The Ultimate Unofficial Guide to the Mysteries of Harry Potter, The Magicial Worlds of Harry Potter, So You Think You KNow Harry Potter, and Quidditch Throughout the Ages and Fantastic Beasts and where to find them.  I'd have to say that my favorite characters are the Marauders and Lily. I'm more of a past fan as it were. I do like Harry, Ron, and Hermione but Lily and James are better in my boook. I roleplay on a few sites, such as neopets, and I usually roleplay as Lily in past roleplays. I'm best at getting into her head. Yet as you can see my fanfic is mostly about Sirius, that's just how I roll. I'm not only about Harry Potter but that's what this site is going to be about. Sorry if you think I'm a dork, nerd, freak, and/or loser, its just something I like a lot.  I'll be posting most of my findings and such here, because I've needed a place to. So if you like it that's great if you don't then don't check it out! Later Dudes! -Shelby

CHAPTER 1 What ever happened that day had been a mystery to Sirius. He had just been a by stander, a looker on. Well he enjoyed it, was that wrong? Was he being a bad friend to James? No of course not, he thought, as he walked the silent c
