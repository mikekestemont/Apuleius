hey--i was bored so i thought i'd come here and write a little somethin. not much happened with me today. i went shopping for a bit and then my aunt and uncle and cousin came over. we babysat my cousin for a little while but that was fun. i'm still really upset that i didnt go to camp. its all i can think about. but i try to keep my mind elsewhere. i try to look at the bright side but its kinda hard to. oh well. i'm still hoping for a job. hopefully someone will call tomorrow. but i doubt it. i seem like i really want a job but i dont. ive already wasted so much time and i couldve had a job months ago but i didnt try. i really need the money tho. but thats about all for now. i cant think of anything else. just the same old boring stuff.lol. oh well. its not like you had to read this. but anyways-im gonna go for now. bYe.
hey--today hasnt been too great. i'm really sad and depressed that i didnt go to camp. i miss it soo bad and i gave up my only chance of ever being chief. i feel awful. but theres nothing i can do now. :( the only thing that i can do is try to take my mind off of it. and im praying that i get my call this week for a job. if i did it would make me feel ok about missing camp because then i could have an actual reason for missing camp. and it would make me feel 10 times better. so im praying for a job this week. lonestar BetTer call me. oh well tho. so other than moping around being depressed today, i went out with my bro morgan to the mall and some other places. it was better than sitting around at home. after that i came home and helped my dad out some outside. and now i'm here. sitting at the computer. typing in this dumb little thing. even though i know no one cares about reading this stuff. lol. Oh WelL. thats all i can think of for now so i'll be back sometime. ByE
hey again--this is my second little post thingy and i know that my last one was also june 19, and it was, but it had just turned the 19th (because it was like 12 somethin in the night). i just wanted to let you all know that im not gonna be writin on here more than once a day. yeah. and its not like it really matters but i just thought i'd let you know. lol. now im confusin myself but hey its all ok. so anyways--today was another boring day. i didnt do anything until around 3:00 and thats when i had to go see my family over at my grandparents house. it was my grandpas b-day and some family was in from tennessee. it was good to see everybody but it got boring...u know how that goes. today was all rainy and it sucked. and im still trying to decide if i should go to camp. i have ONE more day to decide. this is so hard!!! i know no one cares but--i dunno--its just crazy. i also found out some crazy news about my other side of the family but i dont think anyone cares to know. lol. hmmm--so other than that nothing happened today. just one hell of a boring saturday. i guess i should probably quit rambling on and on about my day. nothing exciting i know. so maybe i'll be back on here tomorrow and let u know if im going to camp or not. lol. but i'm done for now. Later.
Hey! I don't really know why I got one of these things--but--I did. lol. I thought I would just write all the WonDerFullY wonderful things that happen in my boring days. haha. yeah, so today i had my second interview at LoneStar and i thought i was definitely gettin the job, BUT he said it went great and it was a shame i wasnt old enough to be a server but they didnt need a host right now but he was definitely gonna call me when one came open--so now i have to wait..and wait..and hopefully get the job. i dont want to work but i kinda have to. NOW, i have to decide if i want to go to 4H camp or not. its either--go to camp and be chief which i will never get to do again--or--stay home and wait on a call for a job which i need. i dont know what to do. i have two days to decide. it sucks ass. oh well. well i know this is really boring and its kinda makin me bored so, i think i'll stop about now. maybe i'll be back tomorrow--i dunno--oh well. Later.
hello. well i havent been on here for a few days and ill tell you why. because work sucks. yes. i had to go in on friday night instead of saturday because the manager had an emergency and had no one else to come in so she trained me for like an hour and left me all alone from 4:00 to closing and i was left basically clueless on most things. but i managed it. sort of. at least i will be gettin paid more than i would have! so i went back on saturday at 7 and she told me i didnt have to come till 8 and she was still gonna pay me for 7 through 9 so that worked out and when i did go back at 8 i didnt do a thing but talk with her and her husband. they were funny tho so it wasnt as boring as it sounds. so i got paid for 2 hours and didnt even do anything. but i dont go back until wednesday&nbsp;so thats&nbsp;ok. its not a bad job. its pretty boring but at l
