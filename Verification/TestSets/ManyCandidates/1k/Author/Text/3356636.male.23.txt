Over the period time, terrorists have proved themselves to very cunning and adaptable. Not only have they shown a very astute understanding of the world affairs, they also have a very acute sense of timing. The Madrid bombings were all the more effective because of their timing. Just three days before the general elections in Spain, it was plan executed to perfection. People in Spain were shocked and angry. And what better way to give vent to their feelings than the elections. A change was affected in Spain and new government promptly pulled out its troops from Spain. Now it seems they have found a new avenue. The oil rich middle east. With the wild fluctuations in oil prices, the vulnerability of the world economy has increased all the more. If and when the terrorists decide to target major oil installations, the repurcussions can be very damaging.  Oil, as a source of energy, has been of critical importance. It has always been a point of conflict. From Pearl Harbour to the two Gulf Wars to the current hostage crisis in Saudi Arabia, it has caused a lot of damage. But how long is all this going to last? What happens when all the petroleum resources, so bountifully provided by Mother Earth dries up? And whats more, it may occur sooner than one might expect. We have become so used to all the amenities and comforts in our lives which come to us, courtsey this 'Black Gold', that imagining any future without this precious natural resource is scary, in the least.  But is it really so? I believe that oil as a source of energy has out-run its utility. Compare electricity with oil. Take the example of railway engines. Those using electricity as a source of energy are far more efficient, clean, powerful, adaptable (Metro-rail) than those using diesel. Railways all over the world are trying to phase out the diesel locomotives. Almost all the appliances used in our homes run on electricity and not on oil. Initially, when there was no electricity, we used to use oil and coal directly to provide for our energy needs. Switch to electricity was effected because it was realised that we have a better source of source of energy. And look how it has changed our lives.  One will obviously point out that we get electricity from oil. Ofcourse it is so, but only because we have not looked elsewhere. If we look hard enough, I am sure we can find a very feasible solution.  When I imagine my future, I imagine a clean future and a secure future. I firmly believe in the spirit of man kind. Time and again he has risen up to challenges, battled the forces of nature and found ways to make his life better. Dwindling oil resources provide such a challenge. The challenge is to come-up with an alternative which is clean and equally, if not more, easy to use. And my money is on man.
Keeping with the messenger thread, wouldnt you like to have a messenger from Google? I know that I would. Just think about it. Google started as a search engine and quickly usurped the top spot from Yahoo. Then it launches gmail and the pre-eminence of Yahoo and Hotmail is again threatened.  The next logical step should be launching a messenger. Needless to say that, technology wise Google has proved to be better than both Yahoo and Hotmail. So it wouldn't be a surprise that if and when Google decide to go for a messenger, we will have something really cool.
I've have had the latest version of Yahoo Messenger for quite sometime, but the LaunchCast function wasn't working on my comp. It finally did today morning. And I am impressed.  Though not all stations are free , among free stations, the 'Classic Rock' and 'Soft Rock' stations are really cool. Most of the songs played here were new to me and not one of them was unlistenable.  I have to get these songs from Kaaza. :)
It is a known fact that writers and painters have a very keen perception of their surroundings. They have an eye for the details and hardly anything escapes their scrutiny. I always believed that it was one of the best gifts that you can recieve from God. But now I believe that not having this gift might have its charms too.  You sit in your room in the morning, looking out of the window, you see the lush green fields, the trees with their leaves fluttering in the morning wind, kids playing, bird chirping and everything bathed in the serene glow of the morning sun. You are filled a sense of joy and expectation. Sometimes it overwhelms you. You are happy with what y
