Ok, it's been a few days. Here's the summary:  * Went back to IKEA - Bought proper desk and built it  * Went to work at LONI - Went to meeting and talked to the point of embarrassment >_  * Tried to figure out how to go to the Offspring concert on Sunday with my cousin - Half-Failed :-( Not quite though :-D... :- * Found out that I weigh 147 pounds - I'm ~5'9"  * Volunteered at Hospital - No, Jessica wasn't there :-( (4/16)  * More math as usual  So yeah... life's boring. It'd be less boring if something went REALLY wrong. Well, come to think of it, it'd probably be more interesting if something went REALLY right (like me getting into MIT or Jessica dumping whoever she's going out with for my non-jewish ass). I'd probably walk around for a few weeks confused regarding what I did to make it all work. Anyway, it's not as bad as I make it out to be. I just work a lot and go for the unattainable but from what I hear, it builds character and mylinates axons. That alone is sexy enough a reason for me to keep workin'.         -- Fea'
Today:  * Did some more math -- Algebra II (I'm not behind or anything, IMP just has it all spread out)  * Called orthodontist -- Tried to change appointment and failed  * Went to LONI -- talked to Rebecca, calculated some volumes, did some other stuff  * Went to IKEA -- bought a desk and a couple lamps and some other small things  * Came home -- Started building desk  * Got a call from Babak -- He just called and yelled at me, partially justified, but still. I mean, who calls just to yell at them and not hear them out? Jackass -.-  * Realized something was wrong -- We bought the wrong desk after building half of it. >_  In conclusion, not a bad day for the most part but it could have been better. I mean, !jeez! that phone call alone can ruin anyone's day especially when I wasn't as wrong as he said I was. Grrr. Yes, that was a period, not an exclamation point(!).      -- Fea'
Today:    * Two point five weeks of math done in six hours. -- Is the book as effective? I doubt it but I need it done.    * Printed like 6 neuroscience papers, but ran out of ink on the 7th of 9 -- I'll read 'em later.    * Didn't load DICOMs with Java Applet -- I'm not surprised though. I didn't put any time into it.    * Practiced Guitar -- Bothered sister, Broke a pick, and I've almost mastered the G and C chords! Watch out, rock and roll hall of fame! Here I come!    * Set up AudioScrobbler Thingy -- Check it out here: http://www.audioscrobbler.com/user/TheGermic/    * Drank a lot of various fluids -- And subsequently pissed like 9 times today    * Hugged mommy -- :-)    * Wrote some e-mails  All in all, it's been a pretty boring day. I listened to a lot of music as usual, I worked a lot as usual, I occupied a good chunk of my day with random stuff as usual. Yep... I think it's been a pretty boring day, but at least it wasn't a bad day... Well, kinda -_-          -- Fea'
Ah HAA!!! Victory is mine...  Okie, That's all I have to say. Peace out.  --Fea'
Here's the gist of it: I feel physically and somewhat mentally exhausted, but I feel extremely restless inside. My parents are getting divorced and I swear it's taking its toll on all of us. I try not to let it effect me but there's only so much I can do. To compound my anxiety, I have those SATs coming up on the 5th of June, which reminds me that I have to write Rebecca an E-mail saying that I can't make it for the next couple of weeks because I need to study for the stupid thing.  I don't like work, I don't like play, I don't like family, I don't like 90% of my life but that's a lot to ask for. I don't think that most people like their lives, but they take what given to them and make the best of it. I've got to try and look at things positively and look at what I do have and try not to focus on what I don't have, and if I do focus on it, not just whine about it, but try to fix it as well. It's not always easy, but no one has it easy. Everyone's got their set of shit.  The 10% of my life that I find enjoyable is the time that I spend with friends and my guitar. There is nothing I value more than a couple good friends. While my cousin Peter is technically family, I consider him more of a friend than a relative. I have to worry about what I say in front of my relatives because of what they might think and how it might reflect on my parents and whatnot. With friends I don't have to do that. They accept me and my beliefs for what they are and don't BLAME anyone else for my position. I wish everyone was like that.  I've known only two people in my life so far who I could trust like that. The first one was Shannon, my ex-girlfriend. She single-handedly helped me grow more than anyone else that I could name. I cared for her deeper than anyone before and to this day, still love and care for her. There is so much that I wish didn't do and so much that I wish I did. I miss her. The other is Peter. My relationship with Peter isn't so deep, or perhaps is deeper just subliminal. He's great to hang out with because he doesn't judge me. He listens, sometimes disagrees, is almost always funny, and has a marvelous singing voice (not really >_  NOTE: If family i
