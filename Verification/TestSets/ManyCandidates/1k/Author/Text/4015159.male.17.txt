Don't you just HATE it when some ignorant Bitch talks directly into your face... well as you may tell I got a dodgy customer at work today... here's a short script of what happened:           James is on the till at Pets At Home, Old Hag walks up to him...             Old Hag: Where's that Johnsons Cat Pet Littertray cleaner?     Jimbles: Pardon?           Old Hag looks fed up, she talks into James's face...             Old Hag: That Johnsons Cat Pet Littertray cleaner!           Note: James is trying to serve customers. Laura (The Deputy Manager comes over)             James (To Laura): Could you help this Lady Please?     Laura (To Old Hag): How can I help you?     Old Hag: I want some of that Johnsons Cat Pet Littertray cleaner!           Laura and James are both confused because the Old Hag is slurring her words, she may be drunk... Laura tries to dismiss the Old Hag...             Laura: I don't think we sell it...           Old Hag is furious.             Old Hag: I've bought it from here before!           Laura thinks for a second, she takes the Old Hag to the product. The Old Hag comes back to the till to pay, at this moment in time there is no queue... After the sale is put through, Old Hag has got yet ANOTHER querie!             Old Hag: I bought a Playpen a couple of weeks ago and the bottom latch is stiff, I've lost my receipt what can I do?     James: You'd be better off asking Laura because if you've lost your receipt I'm not sure...           Old Hag is VERY furious. Note: A queue is building up... GRAVY!!!!!             Old Hag: I've got two cats to feed at home, I haven't got time!     James: Well if you've lost your receipt then I'm afraid you'll have to ask the deputy manager because I'm not sure...     Old Hag: I HAVEN'T LOST MY RECEIPT! I keep a record of all my receipts! But I ma have misplaced or mislaid it.     James: Oh well bring it back and get a refund.           Old Hag leaves, still unhappy. Tempted to say go and get hit by a car, but I'm not that heartless: I wouldn't want the driver to feel guilty!             Anyway it seems that The Old Hag was drunk or mentally ill, I don't care though, she was being a rare bitch and talking into my face, I don't like it when people talk into my face because it's intimidating and rude... Anyway I passed todays task as you  can see but I won't decide tomorrow's until after work...          TTFN

I'm fed up and I feel like crying or hitting something. This past week since my parents got back all I've done is be a slave for them and what have I got in return? Being called a Lazy Shit by my Dad. I'm not having a go but there are A LOT of people my age who don't work! I work, I hate it but I work, so how am I lazy??? I don't get how one minute my Dad can be perfectly fine with me and the next he's a complete and utter prick and he won't stop bullying me (so to speak).       &nbsp;   I'm having one of those days today whee I really feel like lashing out on the first person that does anything wrong to me, I haven't been like this in ages!
Last Night and this morning I've been doing A LOT of thinking about my friends and how they've all stuck by me these past 3 years. I met my current gang of friends back in year 10, only meeting them when I started walking to dinner with them. I met Andy, Andy, Danny, Billy, Sam and the rest of the crew... some I already knew, others were totally new people to me. I came in to the group as an outsider but I was accepted and within weeks became part of one of the best friendship groups to be formed in our school. I never used to be the most social person in the world but my friends brought that side out of me and because of them I am who I am today. Over the last 3 years I've changed a lot, and I think I owe the change to them. I don't believe I've met greater, more unique, people than the ones I hang around with today. I look forward to the parties we have, the trips to the cinema and bowling. I just wish that over the six week holidays I could see them more, they mean everything to me. Not a single day goes by when I don't think of them... I've been through a lot of different friends during my school life and even though I'm always with my friendship group I have branched off, but for s
