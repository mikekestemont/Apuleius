...I decided to braindump without care... with caution to the wind... how very brave of me... I am so proud.  The display of the inner workings of the human mind is complex, and most often quite depressing.  This is, at least, what I gather from it all.  Blogs have taught me this.  And it is the written word, so no matter how you sugarcoat it and make it palatable, somewhere along the line something will be incorrectly perceived and processed.  I wonder how many "friendships" have gone to the wall due to these blogs.  Or just relationships as a whole.  Are Gallup and Zogby busy, per chance?  So today I want to be thankful.  Thankful for my parents doing their best and not abusing me physically, and thankful that I understand my mother didn't mean the psychological things that manifested themselves.  Thankful for having been able to sing in a band, play baseball, do theater work... and various other activities that I have enjoyed over the years.  Thankful that I found a seemingly stable relationship with someone whom I greatly admire as a human being.  Thankful that she helped introduce me and the world to a couple of pretty swell rugrats.  Thankful that I have witnessed so much history and historical places in my lifetime.  I have stood on the hill at Carthage.  I have lived within the remnants of the Warsaw Ghetto.  I have walked through Brandenburg Gate.  (BTW... thanks, Mr. Gorbachev and friends)  I have walked inside a Roman Colloseum.  I have been delayed at Heathrow.  I have crossed St. Charles' Bridge.  I have sat at a bar drinking the original Budweiser (from the Czech Republic) while discussing the history of Central Europe with a variety of characters too diverse to divulge.  Not too shabby for a boy from Arkansas who was too lazy and caught up in life to complete college.  Who'da thunk it?  So, like I said, since no one reads me anyway... I can be reminiscientally thoughtful without concern for being misconstrued as being bragadocious.  I sure could have had it all a lot worse...
If you've never had a true Indian dish, your life, sadly, is not complete.  Allow me to possibly assist you in this endeavor.  Chicken Tikka Masala  Serves 4  Heat level - Mild  Ingredients  5 Tbsp Pataks ( 450g Chicken Thighs or Breast cut into 1/2" cubes 1 Medium Onion Chopped 3 Tbsp Plain Yogurt 1 Small Can Chopped Tomatoes 1 Tbsp Oil  Method  Marinate the chicken pieces in a mixture of the Patak's Tikka Paste and yogurt. Keep aside for 1 hour. Lift out each individual piece from the marinade and arrange on a baking tray. Cook in a pre-heated oven 200 degrees C for 15 - 20 minutes turning once during the cooking process. Brown off under the grill for 2 minutes. Do not discard the marinade since this is the base for your sauce.  Heat the oil and fry the onion until translucent, add the tomatoes and Patak's Tikka Paste marinade and cook for a few minutes. Add the cooked chicken and simmer uncovered allowing the chicken to absorb some of the sauce. If the sauce is too runny boil off some of the liquid. Serve hot with Patak's Rice and Naan Breads.    ENJOY!!! Glad I could help...
Me neither.  But, apparently, I am...        You're  Prufrock and Other Observations !   by T.S. Eliot     Though you are very short and often overshadowed, your voice is poetic and lyrical. Dark and brooding, you see the world as a hopeless effort of people trying to impress other people. Though you make reference to almost everything, you've really heard enough about Michelangelo. You measure out your life with coffee spoons.      Take the  urlLink Book Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid .
I admit it.  I love baseball.  This isn't just an "Oh, it's a great place to drink a beer and eat a dog" sort of thing.  Show me a dirt diamond with well manicured grass, perfectly chalked all the way to the wall, and I am more than just aroused in a passing nature.  My wife and I took our 4-year old son to his first professional baseball game this past week.  He had been to the games when I was playing and coaching in Poland, but SINCE I was playing and coaching, this was the first time I got to sit with him during it all.  Mind you, he didn't soak in all in like his dear ol' dad, but give him time... maybe.  But when he said...  "Dad.  Hey Dad.  There's one ball and two strikes!"  ...tears welled up.  Okay, so that's over-dramatization, but it helps to illustrate the point.  Just being able to feel that link between us was so cool.    We bought popcorn and hot dogs and drinks together.  We hit the souveneir (that spelling looks so wrong, but it's late so I don't care) stand together.  And, get this!  He got to run the bases after the game.  This was Double A ball.  Do you hear me?  His tiny little feet traipsed across the same dirt as the future multi-millionaires of tomorrow did.  Yeah, so he played in the dirt around home plate after he finished, but, c'mon... he's 4!  And it was so great when we had to stand in line to wait for the completion of the game so he and all the other little monsters could take off 90 feet, turn left, run another 90 feet, turn...  We had time to talk and just be guys.  He is so much my buddy.  Oh, and he got thirsty and wanted his Sprite, which my wife had down in her seat.  So, with him constantly checking to be sure I was watching, he independently marched himself down to her, took his gulp, and headed back to me.  He was so proud of himself.  He "did it by myself, Dad".  (Mom helped, but we'll pass over that for his sake.)  See, this was the same ballpark that I saw my first game with my dad when I was three.  1
