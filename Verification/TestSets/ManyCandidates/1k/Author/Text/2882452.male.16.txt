Richard has been shown around almost all the buildings of the age-old University. At last he is introduced to the library.]  Tour Guide : And here we have the Library. Categorized into Fiction, Non-fiction, and subcatorgorised as appropriate.  [As the group move around the library, Richard sees a young man walk into the library and stare intently back at him. After a few seconds he moves over to a group huddled around a table and sits. The tour moves on.]   [Int. Dining Hall. As Richard sits eating more food than is particularly necessary, the young man from earlier sits next to him.]  Richard : "Oh, um, hello."  [The young man is tapping randomly into a calculator]  Quentin : "Pop quiz LPBS hotshot. What day of the week is an anagram of an English word?"  Richard : "(confidently) Monday. It can be rearranged to Dynamo."  Quentin : "I'm Quentin."  Richard : "Richard."  Quentin : "Does you want to know something about this place?"  Richard : "What do you mean?"  Quentin : "English Room. 10 minutes"  [Quentin rises and leaves. Ten minutes later Richard finds himself outside the door to the English conference hall. One of Quentin's crowd from earlier stands guard]  Siegfried : "Millionth decimal place of pi?"  Richard : "What? er...1"  [Siegfried opens the door, and Richard enters the room. All the people who were in the library with Quentin are there, talking animatedly. The whole place has the atmosphere of a military bunker.]  Henry : "Yo, wats dis dood doing in 'ere?

They won't wait while we potter about recruiting members. Has he been initiated? Taken the oath?"  Quentin : "Patience brothers! Partario, inform TSGOF of the news."  Richard : "Um, hate to be an nuisance, but, where the hell am I?"  Cuthbert : "0100011001001111010101010100110000100000010011000100000101 0011100100011101010101010000010100011101000101001000010010000100100001"  Gordon : "Fou-"  Quentin : "I know what he said. Richard, we do owe you an explanation."  Cyril : "1 |)0|\|'7 |_1|  Quentin : "CREW!! SILENCE!! Brother Richard. This is the absurdly titled: Oxfard Crew"  Partario : "the name woz my idea :D"  Siegfried : "How did that get a majority?"  Partario : "STFU u idiot. u smell nd i tink dat u r wiv teh nme in dis"  Quentin : "(ignoring others) We are a collective group of upperclass Oxford University students. The dialects and speech patterns that are synonymous with the enemy derive from our need to blend in with them in society."  Richard : "Um...the enemy?"  (At this the others turn away from Richard and busy themselves.)  Quentin : (hesitantly) "...the ones you call...roodbois...NEDs, townies pikeys, call them what you will. IN the end it matters not. They have taken over society and replaced our norm with theres. We seek out those who have not succumbed to a life of nonconformist conformity. That is why we approached you. We have made it our goal to rid the world of this scourge. BY ANY MEANS NESSECARY."   -Chapter 1 : Initiates-   [In English Hall 1]  Quentin : "Cyril, my number two. His main task is forging library cards that can't be traced to us. If a roodboi were to discover us as users of the library our whole operation would be in jeapordy. Cuthbert, who i'm sure you noticed speaks only in binary when at work, and his translator, Gordon. They mainly work as logistics teams and webmasters, organising the assassinations."  Richard : "A-assassinations?"  Quentin : "You will learn in time. Henry, he has a sister in our female chapter, the TSGOF. He himself has an unparalled way with words. He mainly works as interpreter, linguist or sometimes just helps us talk our way out of a tough spot with the enemy. Siegfried, our doorman. German, so you two should get on famously. We know you were going to take it at A-level. Sieg usually handles the insults, the flames and the tough talk. Wouldn't hurt a feather though. Now, Partario probably couldn't hurt a feather. Weak, but excellent at stealing and that last kill on the Evening Massacre. Caruthers doesn't do much actively. a chauffeur mainly, but also be counted on to give advice to anyone. Great person. Now, that just leaves you.  Richard : "Me? What do you mean?"  Quentin : "Between you and me, we've lost too many frontline workers. Our assassin guild is all but destroyed, and our last major logistics advisor, Elizabeth was knifed in the street, so she moved to the TSGOF. That's why I asked you t-"  Richard : "Wait a second? KNIFED? As in -"  Quentin : "- sharp object, dead, floor, blood yes. Oh get that look off your face all will be explained! Now, have a walk around, familiarise yourself with the place. G
