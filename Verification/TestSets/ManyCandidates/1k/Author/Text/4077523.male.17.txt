Well, it is raining here so I decided to check around some places and find some sites for a rainy day. And they are:     urlLink  http://www.waitallday.com/    ahhh...waitallday.com, I think the name pretty much says it all. I wasn't about to wait though. I don't know why I put this, maybe I can use it to trick someone or something.    urlLink  http://www.bored.com/    I got bored with it.    urlLink  http://www.i-am-bored.com/    is better than   urlLink  http://www.bored.com/     urlLink  http://www.ebaumsworld.com/    I have fun messing with the sound boards on this site but just for warning, there will be some choice words on some of them.    And Best for Last.....(drum roll).....   urlLink  http://www.homestarrunner.com/    I like this site the best. Plenty to do.     I guess that is it for the Rainy Day Review, I should have more and better sites for next month, or next time it rains here. Peace!
Hey everyone, I'm just kinda bored this morning so I guess I will post another one. I am just sitting here and my family is at a water park, I chose not to go to it because first off I am not really in the mood due to previous circumstances which brought me down, and b I never really liked doing family trips because they seem to be boring. If I did the family vacation myself I would not make it boring.    The youth ministry I am a part of came back from Beach Blast yesterday. B.B. is a camp we go to that we make ourselves. I wasn't able to go because of Band Camp, my band director wouldn't let me go. It is the only trip that I want to go on and really work for even if I go on others. I wish I could have gone because if I did go I wouldn't have been through what I went through this week, and Justin had the nerve to instant message me and say "You missed out."That is the last thing I want to hear, number one because I know I missed out on something better than this, and number two it wasn't my choice to miss out on B.B. because my mom made me, it was her money and at the time I didn't have enough to pay for the trip. It is really hard trying to see what God wants for me even after going through stuff like this. But, I pray I will see and I probably wont see until after it is over and hindsight is a beautiful thing. I could use everyones prayer that reads this, and thanks. -De Colores
Hey everyone! I just got back from my lunch break, fun, fun, I know. This is my last day at this job and then School starts back for me on the 10th. I am just writing this now because I am bored and there really isn't much else to do. I might do a bit of surfing and stuff before I leave this job today. More than likely I will be doing this again next summer. What is it that I do you ask? Nothing, haha, I just get to sit here and make minimum wage for doin nothing. I think I have worked a total of 4 hours this whole summer and get paid for an 8 hour a day job. Well anyway, i'm gonna go and surf some more so I will probably post later. Peace!
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey everyone, my name is Daniel and I live in Mississippi. This is my first blog and first post. I am no where near perfect but I am a Christian.  &nbsp;&nbsp; So what's up people? I am glad I am done with Band Camp for this year and I am so happy it is my last high school band camp, YAY! Yeah, i'm in the band, haha, I am the tuba playa. I think this is the first year I have been in this band where they actually took it seriously and didn't play around (as much).  &nbsp;&nbsp; Tomorrow, I get to go to my last day at work, it's just a summer job so no more paycheck unless I get a job sometime during the school year. Wow, i'm so tired right now, I can't quit yawning. So anyway, Fly with Christ.
Hey, tonight was an awsome night. In youth we learned about what worship is and God really spoke to me tonight. I thought I would share the outline he had with yall.  Worship is:   Your mind and heart's affection.  Responding appropriately to Him.  Your posture should be appropriate in worship.   Yall probably think the last one is a bit weird, however if you think about it, it could distract others in worship if you are too laid back or something like that. 2 Scriptures that you can look up are Romans 12:1,2 and Psalms 42:1,2.  Today was an overall good day, I am not sure how I will make it through Chemestry though. I already have a project to do and it will be very difficult to get some of it done. I got out of school before lunch today and ate at Pizza Hut for lunch, then went and helped out a little at the church. After that me and Jarrod (who isn't moving by the way) went to get something and I will tell you more in about a week or less. Well, i've got to go, Adios!
Sup People! Well not much has happened in the past 2 days. Pretty much just church yesterday and school today. I have an interview thing to do tonight. Well I got to go, c-ya.
Hey, Hey, Hey! How's it goin? I had an AWSOME tim last night. The dinner wasn't boring. I have rarely been that hyper, haha. I think it is easy to catch the hyperness around Tiffany. I have never talked so much before and we were able to talk to each other the whole time. And if you are reading this Tiff, Your AWSOME.     Today I just got Road Runner (high-speed internet) YAY, it is about time I finally got i
