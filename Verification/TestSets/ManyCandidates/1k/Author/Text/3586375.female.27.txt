Tonight Steph and I went to Macy's Furniture Store at Shopper's World and I found a great Couch, Loveseat and Recliner set for a great price!!! YAY! I think it will look really nice in our new apartment and it is SO comfy. It will come on the 9th.   After that, we had dinner and watched some of the Sox game at J.J. McKay's in Wayland... My old hood.   Tomorrow I am bringing Berkley to the vet at 9:00am and then Mom is coming over to help me wrap the breakables. I am going to grab plenty of newspaper to wrap with... Thanks Dave for your brilliance!   I saw Erica and Allen at the bank today... They just got back from Hawaii and they seem to be absolutely thrilled with life.
Today is my last day working before we move. Tomorrow I will finish packing up all of my breakables and odds and ends and then go over and clean the new apartment. Thursday I will actually move all of the stuff and Friday we will unpack and decorate!!! I am really excited!
I sold my couch. Wooohooo... Now I am so excited to go and get a nice new one that FITS in the average door. I am telling you, if you ever want to sell anything, post it on craigslist.com.
Grandma came home from the hospital today!!!!!!
The Yard Sale 2004 was successful! It was our fourth annual sale, and we were successful money-wise, but more importantly, we had the greatest time!! Friday Mom made about 27 signs for us to hang up!!! She did a really good job and everyone who came commented on how great our signs were. Friday afternoon, Carol and I drove around for three hours and hung signs on telephone poles, desperately trying not to get runover. It was quite funny. About 10 people we know drove past us and said hello at one point or another. On Saturday and Sunday we all arrived at 7:00am(ish) each day and started the set up. On Saturday Michele greeted us at 11:30 with bagels and set up her stuff as well. Mom provided us all with constant beverages and a lovely spread for lunch both days. Carol brought gorgeous fruit, Andrew spent a lot of time hanging out and helping us, and Allen helped Carol stransort goods. Bob helped us both days with the set-up and clean-up. And then Mom and Bob, and Carol, Andrew and Michele all chipped in to help take down the signs. So thanks to everyone!! It really was so much fun. At the end of last night we all got pizza and had some wine and beer to toast a successful 2004. And if you didn't make it this year, be sure to be there in 2005!! =)   There was certainly one downer to the weekend... My grandparents were missing for the first time. And it led to a few emotional breakdowns for all of us over the course of the weekend. At one point, an older gentleman came to our house. He walked straight right up the driveway and didn't look at anything we were selling. He just came right up to my mother and I and said "Where's that older fellow that's here every year?" And after meeting my Grandfather at our first sale in 2001, he has returned every year ONLY to come and visit with my Grandfather. And he was concerned about where Grandpa was and disappointed to find out he was unable to visit with him this year. Also, when my Mom told Grandma that Carol and I were hanging up the signs, she said "ohhhh, that's my job!" And everytime something sold of my grandparents it was sad, because they always get so excited when something of theirs sells and they like to meet the person who is buying it and talk about it. But... Next year right?   unfortunately I don't have any news to share yet about my Grandmother. On Friday we thought she would be coming home today, but I think things may have turned back the other way over the weekend. I will let you know as soon as I hear anything, but my Mom says that when she spoke with her yesterday she sounded really bad. We need to get her home.   And last night I watched the movie "Monster" which was freaky and then I took Nyquil and passed out.
I am so relieved that it is Friday and that I actually made it through this week!!! Not that the work is over... My family along with the Prices, and Michele are having our annual Yard Sale this weekend. My Grandparents have always come too, but since she is till in the hospital, they obviously wont be able to make it this year. However, so characteristic of my Grandmother... Just like she made and froze meatballs and soup and eggplant and sauce, etc. for all of us to eat while she was she was in the hospital, she also packed the packages full of items to send to us to sell at the Yard Sale before she went into surgery. She is too much! So, although we will miss them a ton, and it will be hard without them, they will be with us in thought!   My grandmother seams to be finally recovering. Slowly but surely. So please continue to pray for her.   Anyhow, I am off now to go and hang up yard sale signs with my mom and Carol, and start pricing items. If you want to come to the sale, email me and I'll give you the info!!

My Grandmother was supposed to come home from the hospital today. But, in the middle of the night, her foot and leg went numb. She thought it had just fallen asleep, but it turns out that her heart released a clot and it lodged in her leg. So, within the hour they need to do emergency s
