My Gussy is my big black fat cat.  I'd call him fat ass, but he'd just sit on me.  Come to think of it, he does that anyway, so I guess it's not a big deal. :)  No, I wouldn't really call him fat ass, he'd give me the eye and then give himself a bath. :)  Em, CONGRATS on the graduation!  I sorry I won't be there tomorrow, but you'll be in my thoughts!  Yey for you!  You did it!    Well, it's about that time so I'm going to get my stuff together and stop over to see how Sarah is doing with the packing and moving.  She's going back to NY for three weeks and then on the 27th she's off to Alaska.  If it weren't for the eagle-sized mosquitos, I'd be completely jealous.    Have a good one and I'll talk to you next week!  KJT:)
I'm not sure if my Gus looks like your Gus, it's been awhile. But he is definately a big fur ball. His offical name is Gus "The Chunk" Beresford or as John likes to call him Fat Ass. A mother never calls her child fat ass so John is getting vetoed (as usual) ;) Glad everyone is doing well. I'll write more later, need to get back to work.
**MAJOR GRANSTREETGIRLS ANNOUNCEMENT**  *ahem*  Allow me to toot my own horn. I AM DONE WITH COLLEGE!!!! I just turned in my final undergraduate paper and it feels gooooooood!  Just wanted to take a moment to thank all of you (and I'm being serious here)- for all of your support over the years of my in school vs. out of school antics. I think I'm too old to party like a rock star- but damn this feels good. Emily
Does your Gus look much like my Gus?  Something about round fluffy animals...:)  So far today has been quiet.  Everyone is taking off for the summer, some students are graduating, and my friend Sarah Livingston is going to Alaska for an internship.  I talked to my grandpa last night.  He was in the hospital part of last week and they found some bloodclots in the back of his heart, but he's taking blood thinners for that and since he never really felt bad, he's just enjoying the attention.  My folks are back from their vacation in North Carolina.  I'm going up there to do laundry this weekend and there has been talk of going to Angola to see Grandpa, but I don't know.  The cats are fine, and Katy's ear is getting better (she had a yeast infection in it; how gross is that?).  Other than that, same old, same old.  I'm sure I'll come back in and ramble some more later, but in the mean time, have a good one!
Pretty cool. I'll put it on my favorite sites so that I remember to check it ofter. Things are pretty much the same for me and John. Workin and more workin. We kept one of Wrigley's puppies and named him Gus. Why you ask? Simple he looks like a Gus. He one big fat furball.
Yey!  Yeah, I figure we'll all still send personal emails between each other, but this looks like a good place to hold a forum.  Plus it'll keep me from playing Bejeweled all the time.  Admitting you have a problem is the first step to overcoming it, right? ;)  I keep waiting for the day when Garry comes out and tells me to stop playing on the computer and get back to work.  I'm still getting work done but I can't help it if I like to play a game or two after lunch and before I go home....:)  Yeah, this is definitely healthier for my brain. :)  Oh, and just a quick note about the page: when you finish your message you have to hit the "print and publish" button to have it appear on the site.  If you hit the post button it'll move to the editting box below the text box and you can go in and make more changes or whatever before you post it to the web.  We can go in and read each other's stuff if we log in here but if we just want to go check out the web site we won't see each other's new logs.  Yeah, I have no life and have been playing with this site too much in the last two days. :)  Ok, back to the grindstone.  KJT:)
I hope I'm doing this right! What a cool idea! I'll pass this on to my grandma- cuz I'm sure she'd like to post one for the family. Even though I'll still send emails out- this is a great way for us to keep "updated".  Great idea 'rissa! Em
Hey, everyone!  I thought this might be a good way for us to keep in touch.  I know that we are all really busy and going through interesting times, but if we just take 5 minutes a week and let each other know what's going on, it'll be great.  I miss hearing from all of you!  I was listening to the radio the other morning and heard a really neat report on Bloggers.  That set me thinking, this would be a great way for us to keep track of each other.  Instead of writing four separate messages or sending out a mass email, this would let us all talk to each other in a more natural way.  Anyway, it's just an idea.  IF you're into it, hopefully I'll see you all here.  And yes, John is still one of our Grant Street Girls. :)  Miss you all!  KJT:)
Cara- there isn't one open just yet- it might be 6 months, or maybe sooner or later. It all depends on if anyone happens to give notice or not. And if not- then next year, Ted wants to create a position for me- but they didn't allow him to build in another position this year  with this budget. I just feel that I should tell Jim that there is a p
