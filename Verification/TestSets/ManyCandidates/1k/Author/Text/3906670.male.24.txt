Yesterday nite, I ended a relationship wif a friend I knew outside... Not I ended of course, she ended it. This friend of mine, though can be quite lame sometimes, but is quite nice and funny. But she's a bit too temperamental. She told me before that she blocked off some of her frens in msn and deleted their numbers off her handphone if she find them boring or there's nothing to talk to them. I wonder that if she does that, she might really miss those that can really be her friends instead of some that she currently has. I really scared that she fell into bad company again. She got into trouble once and went into Girl's Home. Now she's under probation. But I also pity her because now she cant even go out of her house, she can only stay in her house till this October. If I were her, I would feel super bored also. So sometimes I can understandwhy her behaviour and attitude to people are like that.   But just yesterday night, I told her on the phone that i want to brush my teeth first and then continue my conversation with her. She rejected at first, asked me to continue to chat with her. Then I chatted with her a while and asked the same question again... She rejected again. Then finally, She say "Okie" and hang up my phone suddenly. Then in my MSN, she messaged me saying "eh we dun contact ler. bb ~ =P". Believe or not, when i saw that message, it was so hurting. And like that I lost a friend whom I want to guide so that she won't go the wrong way in her life.&nbsp;I thought I would able to meet her during the October but guessed that won't be possible le...   Now I'm listening to the song "Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word"... Suddenly I feel like saying sorry to her if I have agitated her or wat. But I have never regreted of being her friend...  Sigh... dun wanna blog anymore now... No other words to express my feelings inside me...
Last friday, i went off for a chalet at Aranda Club which is near the Pasir Ris Escape Theme Park. That's why i wasn't online all these days. Wonder if there's people missing me these days... haha~~ Anyway, it was fun and the place there is so nice, compared to the Costa Sands and NTUC one. The place looks like a hotel room to me, with nice beds to sleep on, air-con in everwhere you go. But only a few of us turn out in the first day. Most people came for the BBQ which is on the second day, but left in the night of the same day. So still left the pathetic number of us that night, but still.. overall is fun. Over there, we discussed about some things like the singer, Ou De Yang Ocean, coz he din reveal his real looks and we felt that his looks must be cannot make it, but voice is good. Then we also played FIR songs, with my friend playing guitar. My friend&nbsp;is pretty good in guitar and he managed to catch some of the chords for FIR songs which&nbsp;I heard that it's pretty hard because their songs modulate a lot. And also we try&nbsp;hear more Ba Gua news from each other because we have&nbsp;a long time never heard of each other's news... haha~~ That's the trend in my group.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would want to stay a bit longer over there on Sunday, but too bad that I have promised a friend to watch Mean Girls on that day. And I have to rush all the way from&nbsp;Pasir Ris&nbsp;to the Boon Lay... the two extreme points of a MRT trip. &nbsp; I think I fell sick during the stay, because the air con there is so cold. No one knew how to off it till the clever me saw the switch at the ceiling. Now I got a bit of cough and flu, but think it's recovering by itself... Oh yah, talking about Mean Girls, it is very nice indeed, plus I use free tix to watch, so double nice~~ Then spend the whole day with my friends, went to play arcade games which i seldom go these days. But over there, I pick up car racing and pretty like much about it. By then I was pretty tired, so decided to go home and touch my computer which i haven't done for these days... &nbsp; But coming back home makes me think of doing my project... which is... sigh. Still have to do it though, maybe later... before I go for choir practice today, which is dancing. But maybe I can't dance because I am a bit sick... well.. see first then
Sigh... well, another boring day has passed. Supposed to go swimming in the morning but stupid rain spoilt the day. But I can get the chance to sleep longer. Recently I have been slacking a lot... like to lie on my bed till 12 plus before i wake up, though i was already awaken.  At least I did something productive today, finally get the mood to read my project stuffs and found some new materials. Spend the whole day doing that, quite boring though, so i played my synthesizer to kill the boredom. Gish.. think i shld brush up wif my key scaling, getting worse... But I found the kick in playing Lonely Season by David Tao and of course the song itself is so nice... coz it describes most of my feelings inside me.  Talking about Lonely Season, the feeling of being lonely has been a norm to me all the while. So I might be found being anti-social by some people but please, I don't do that on purpose. I guessed that's me sometimes, likes to be alone, though i also joke and make fun with my friends around me. That's why some of my friends in Music Clinic found me quiet a
