This is both an introduction and conclusion, as the title implies.  I have been blogging for four months.  Blogging has become a part of my routine, a way of exploring myself, and a way of exploring the boundaries of the virtual world and the real one.  I have come to believe that the online world gives us a unique opportunity to be more open, more creative, and more true to ourselves, by providing a thin covering between us and others.  This thin veil is protective; it keeps us from being wounded by never really exposing all that we could, keeps the social order of things intact.  In real life, we are forced to constructed this veil, and it keeps us from making all of the deep connections that we could, and forces us to use creative energy that would be better spent in building knowledge of who we are.  In the virtual world, that veil is constructed for us.  We are able to express ourselves in new and deeper ways not having to worry that we will be pushed to the outside.  On the net, we are given a confessional screen of anonymity, and with that already in place we are able to begin reconstructing ourselves in a way that is closer to who we think that we really are.    The following entries are attempting to talk about blogs in this way.  They are meant to be read from the first to the latest entry.  I suggest going to the entry log on the right hand side of the screen and starting from the bottom and moving up.  I have made links possible where the material was online.  Below I have provided a works cited so that if you want to be old school about my sources you can find them.  I hope that this adds to the discussion that is currently in place around web journaling.    And remember: “ urlLink A blog gives you your own voice on the web.  It’s a place to collect and share things that you find interesting- whether it’s your political commentary, a personal diary, or links to web sites you want to remember… what ever you have to say, Blogger can help you say it”     Works Cited:   Cohhaim, Wallys.

McNeill makes the claim that blogs are blurring the line between reality and virtual reality.  I have discussed this in several other sections of the paper, and think that in this, my second to last section it is important to revisit.  The online journal blurs lines in several ways: The blog creates a relationship between the author and the audience- both of which only know of each other in a virtual world, but both assume that they exist in the real world as well and the online journal creates a space that has the social aspects of the real world, but with few of the real world impacts if you do something wrong.    The relationship between author and audience is one of trust.  Part of the thrill of reading about someone else’s exploits is that they happened.  There is no fun in it if you find that it is all fiction.  I readers expect what I write to be real or to have clearly defined markers of what is and isn’t real.  When I am writing a piece of fiction, they should be able to tell.  For example, on  urlLink March 29th  I undertook to write a bit of fiction for my blog.  I can only assume that my readers knew this, considering how obvious it is.   I would not tell them a story that was obviously false however.  If I wanted to write about something, and not tell them what it was, well, that’s fine.  They get to hear me describing the emotions, or the after effects, or the state the event put me in.  I just don’t write about the event, as in the case of  urlLink April 3rd   At other times, when I have a more concrete story to tell, well I tell the story (see April 5th right above the linked space above for just such an instance.) According to McNeill this is a common occurrence in blogs, and if an active audience finds out that they have been mislead, they retaliate.  Its never really occurred to me to not be truthful in the blog.  This honest relationship succeeds in smudging line of reality however.  By telling real stories in an unreal space, recounting physical events on a physic plain, we are blurring lines.  By believing a form of a person that we only encounter out in internet space, and believing that they exist outside of the medium of the blog, we are blurring lines.  The space that we create is a superman phone booth.  As we move onto the online reality, the virtual reality, this phone booth is there.  In the phone booth we can either take off a persona or put one on.  Using my blog I have the fluidity to create a slightly expanded personality or a more vulnerable one.  I am able to try on different parts of myself, show different parts off, and become new in some way.  I believe that a blog, and much of the online world, gives you the option to do both at once.    When I am writing my blog I am not putting on untruths- I am attempting to express myself more.  I am taking off a protective viel- I am saying things that I am sometimes unwilling to say in real life to a person.  However, I
