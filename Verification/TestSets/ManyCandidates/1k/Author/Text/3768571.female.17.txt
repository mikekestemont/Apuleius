As you may have noticed, I dislike a lot of things. I don't like politics, I don't like the way the country is run, I don't like the National Curriculum, I don't like reality television, I don't like children, I don't like adults, you can probably see where I'm going with this: I dislike a lot.   But all of that people can handle. They say "yeah... I see your point."   However, there's one thing that sends people into fits of disbelief, their minds are shunned into dubious incredulity, they take on a defensive stance and tell me I'm clinically wrong in the head. What do I say to get this reaction? "I hate Harry Potter"  THAT'S RIGHT FOLKS!!! I can't stand the little horror.  I was having a discussion with my friends in the 6th Form common room and they were telling me how the books are brilliant, and the characters are great, the storyline is wonderful etc. Then someone told me that I obviously hadn't read the books. Well excuse me, but how could I possibly have formed an opinion if I hadn't *tried* to read the godforsaken thing?! Sheesh.   I tried to read the books and got to about the second chapter and the thought washed over me like a calm little wave on a Caribbean beach; 'my 12 year old brother could have written this'. I didn't like J.K's style at all. To me, it is childish and quite frankly, boring. That's right! I said HARRY POTTER was BORING. HA!   And then the films came out. Loooovely. I'm an avid movie watcher, I do enjoy films. I like the artistic value behind them as well as the storyline. And I can honestly say, I have not yet sat down in order to watch one of the Happy Rotter movies. My brother has acquired copies from his little friends and I can say I have seen parts of them here and there (the movies, not his friends, that is) and I wasn't very impressed. What I like most are the parts played by Robbie Coltrane and John Cleese. What I don't like are the overacted child parts. I'm sure Daniel, Emma and Rupert are lovely people, but the films just aren't my thing.  Although I suppose the thing I dislike most about it is the titanic hype around it. When a new HP book is released people seem to want to queue overnight to buy their copy at some ridiculously early hour of the morning. People claim "these are the best books I've ever read!" "Harry Potter's awesome!" What I want to know is, would they have the same reaction if the hype wasn't so big? Would they still love it so much if there wasn't so much merchandise around it? Would they still think it was one of the best things ever written? I doubt it.  I'm not saying I hate Harry lovers, because that's not true. If it were true then I wouldn't have any friends, but I am proud to say I am not a Harry lover. I just love to hate him.  You know the old saying; 'don't knock it until you've tried it'. Well, as far as Harry Potter is concerned, I have tried it. And now I'm knocking it.
According to the BBC (HA!) in between 60% and 70& of children in between 6 and 17 are overweight.   Apparently, they don't get enough exercise.  Apparently, they watch too much T.V.  Apparently, they don't eat enough fruit and vegetables.  Apparently, the food they eat at school is too high in sugar.  Why do I keep putting the word 'apparently' at the beginning of my sentences? It's all true, isn't it? Yes, yes it is. But i'm just slightly humouring the situation. Who are the ones saying all this? The government...teachers...parents... what do all these people have in common? (Overworked and underpaid? Possibly, but that's not the answer I'm going for.) The thing they all have in common is that they are all ADULTS. The very essence of society.   A child's parents are the main influence on said spawn's life. They are the ones who shape it, mould it into fine human beings. Does it not stand to reason that if the child is introduced to exercise at a young age, and parents make the exercising fun, then the child will grow up to enjoy exercise and will remain fit and healthy.  The parents are also the ones who have the final say on how much television a child is permitted to watch, how much time they spend playing computer games etc. Children have absolutely no sense of common reasoning, so isn't it obvious that it's their parents who should be firm in their discipline and cast the deciding vote on such activities?  Lunchbox-style food is aimed at children, it's packaged in pretty colourful boxes with free toys; the kinds of things kids like. Most of these kinds of foods are extremely high in additives, namely because they're cheaper and easier to mass-produce. BUT if they made the things with proper ingredients, then the kids would be getting better stuff.  Now, the whole food thing just really racks me off, because, quite frankly, who does the shopping?! If the parents didn't buy all the rubbish they seem to be feeding their offspring, then the kids wouldn't eat it! Take me, for instance. My dad buys cereal bars instead of chocolate, extra fruit instead of crisps, cranberry juice instead of fizzy drinks: you catch my drift? If he bought sweets and fatty foods and the such, then that's what I'd eat!   Except I wouldn't, actually, because now i'm old enough to see beyond the pretty colourful package and realise exactly what good food is. I know how to cook, and I can cook for my brother and I, and a whole host of guests if needed, when my dad's at work. I think for kids to learn how to cook would be a great step for the government, then they'd have more scope as to what t
