Yesterday I took a couple hours off early from work to go get the car fixed up.  I needed to get some new tired put on because my exisiting ones were worn.  When I called NTB to reserve some tires the salesman, the manager, asked me "Any particular brand?"  I replied with, "Perferably the best."   He then quickly recommended Michellen, but there was only 2 in stock for my size.  So I went with second best, the BF Goodwrench tires.  They still cost 440 dollars.  Anyways,  I went I got those put on Thursday afternoon.  While I was waiting in the waiting room, some other customer was getting upset because he had been waiting there for 3 hours.   I later decided to get my alignment corrected and then the fuel injectors, oil, and transmission.  Did I leave anything off?  Oh I then got the car washed.  But those tires are nice.  I stuck a penny into the thread and lost Lincoln's head.  I should be prepared for the winter weather with my traction tires.  So by the end of the day I had spent around 700 dollars.  Plus I got some baseball cards at Toys R Us.  I might be a sucker when I pay out for car maintenance, but when my car is happy...I am happy.  I have mistreated her some in the past when I have gotten lazy or when I try to stretch an oil change another to 3100  miles.  That reminds me I need to detail the inside this weekend, I promised her.
Well today I need to go get new tires put on my Civic.  I reserved some BFs from NTB and will go get them put on if I have time today.  I also want to stop by Jiffy Lube and get my fuel injectors cleaned and transmission flushed along with the oil change.  Time to get the car fixed up.   It is the morning now.  Today at work I want to work on the calculator compiler.  But I really am not 100% motivated at work nowdays.  I can't stand my office mate.   This guy talks on the phone all day about his son's little league games.  He sounds like such a "soccer mom."  He really don't have a real job besides paper pushing and I seriously doubt his keeness in that task.  Yesterday he was searching for boxes because he was moving.  He asked if I had seen any large monitor boxes.  I thought to myself a refigerator box would be bigger for you to live in.  This is the same guy when he moved into the office rearranged the office so that he consumed more space for his 1/4th of the office.   Anyways, I am off.
Well I typed something into this Blog thing and then somehow I hit the backspace.   Then my browser we back to the previous page.  So I tried to go forward and then post was gone!  I guess I can't make mistakes or else you lose everything.  These blog people still need some tuning up before this stuff becomes mainstream.
Well it's Monday again. Today I had cereal and OJ for breakfast. I decided to wear my button up shirt untucked today. I then came to work listening to news radio. I just finished eating a PB sandwhich and bannana with milk for my lunch. If the weather is good this afternoon/evening I will go for a jog.
I was out shopping on this Saturday.  When I was in Target I saw a mother and son next to the baseball card counter.  I could tell the son was wanting to get a pack of Topps or Upper Deck.  It reminded me a lot of me when I wa 13 years old standing next to the baseball cards at the shopping store.  So anyways, I had to get some cards.  I was first going to only get one pack, but thought why only 1.  I have the money to spend on a couple of $1 or $2 packs of childhood.  So I grabbed 9 packs of different brands of cards.  It felt kinda weird randomly getting something like this without care of money while these kids with a $5 bill stood there deciding on what few packs they wanted to get.  That was fun.  That was grown up.  It was spontaneous and I can't wait to open them.  I just want to savor the moment of opening a fresh pack of cards.  The suspense of who is inside.  What inserts are in there or what do these new generation 2004 baseball cards look like.  It will be fun.
Hey it's Thursday.  Tommorrow is paypay.  Today I skipped breakfast.  Arrived at work around 9 am.  I had chocolate milk and a cheeseburger for lunch.  Then around 5 pm I drove home.  It was pouring rain on the way back.   I had a chicken pot pie for dinner.  Then I played with my computer and watched the Braves game.  The Braves won.  Now it's time for bed.
Well I came home today from a long day at work and went for my usual jog.  I went 3 laps which comes out to be about 3 miles total.  Then I came back to my apartment and took a shower.  Today I skipped breakfast.  I had a peanut butter sandwhich and chocolate milk for lunch while sitting at my desk.  Then dinner was ramen noodles.  I spent the evening watching the History Channel.  Modern Marvels was about fortifications and then Liberty Ships.  Did you know they used to built ships in 4 days?  That Kaiser was quick.  Anywho, now it is Early Edition on PAX.  I must be like 50 years old.  Oh, damn, I am half way to 50.  I just realized that.
Well the finale of Joe Schmo just aired.  It was good.   Austin and Piper decided to renew their relationship and get married.  But before they were about to tie the know, Bryce came out and revealed the act.  Tim and Amanda took it really well.  It was like they just wanted to get drunk and f
