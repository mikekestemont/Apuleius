monday was a weird but wounderful night for me, as i sat down to my computer on msn talkin to my friends, rather than studying for my maths sac which i might add i fuck up real bad, i was talking to a friend of mine, and she reveled something that i never expected...  the reson that i didnt expect it was because i thought she had a boyfriend, and she asked all of these really weird questions which started to get my suspicious... then in more or less words she tells me that she has somewhat fallen for me...  well i did not prepare for this at all and it totally threw me off guard... i did not expect this person to like me at all... but at the same time i am not complaining...  she is one of the nicest people that i have ever met (i would be saying liga is one of the nicest at this point but she cracked the shits with me playing uno today so ner). She is so genuine and funny, and not to mention pretty... and going otu with her would not be a bad thing at all...  The only thing that threw me was when she said she wanted to take it slow, but didnt know what she meant by it ... argh... but i am willing to wait and take it slow... thinking about it all day tuesday, i finally came to realise that it had been in front of my face all the time and i hadn't seen it... well like i said earlier i thought she had a b/f... but it definatly changes things between us...  i dont really know y she likes me though... she says i make her laugh and i am interesting... ha... i laugh at that... im stupid, maybe to some people that is interesting  yes i do like her and no i will not hesitate to go out with her because she is such a nice person...but i cant help but that something has to go wrong cause everytime i do feel this good something does go wrong...  i feel that something has to go wrong cause im  feeling way too damn good
today was the final exam for the mid year and it was relieving... sitting a 3 hour long english exam will tend to make u very sleepy  i would however like to clear a few things up about a particular rumor i happened to hear a while back... Certain people think that i like a girl at school when i really dont... a few things went down once at a party her and myself were attending, but that was in fact it... i dont care for her and never have... and i dont plan to in the future... afer hearing this rumor i am scared to look at her cause i dont wanna know what she feels cause i really dont like rejecting people, but if thats how it goes down, then thats how it will go down...  The only real reason i talk to her is to tell her to  shut up and things like that... im not the best of friends with her and dont really intend to be... and i know the sorts of people who would spread this kind of thing and i dont like them for doing it...  Some people think that i like her and i really, really dont... might i add eeeewwwwwwww...  people get it through ur heads that  i dont wanna know  about any of it and i really dont care!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
today was my first official exam for year 12.. and not to blow my own trumpet or anything but i think i did really well... I could actually answer every question that the stupid exam threw at me, and now im real happy.. My practice exam was nothing to be proud of... 50% (d)... but i believe that i did a whole lot better on this exam then i thought i would which is such a relief  It is so hard for me to be the only person in my biology class who has no clue of anything... i dont think anyone can concour with this thought (see i even make spelling mistakes)... i try so hard only to fail everytime and now i believe that i have succeeded... no words can describe that feeling... and by the way it was a biology exam... Between my teacher losing my coursework, then finding it again, and getting a 'd' on my practise exam, i was floating up shit creek to put it nicely, and to finally feel like i have come out on top is relieving to say the least...  Everyone thought that i would crack when it came to crunch time, and only a select few actually believed that i could do it... i dont even think my family believed i could... and to prove everyone wrong is a feeling that is undescribeable... I think that most people wanted to prove me wrong when i said i would or even could be as good as some are... they wanted me to fail so badly...  Let me tell you something else its gonna take more than a stupid fucking biology exam to put me down... i will fight to be as good as i can until i am dead and buried... mark my words all of you... i will fight until i have nothing left to give...  So to all those little fucks who thought that they could kill my spirit...   Shoot me again, i ain't dead yet!!!
