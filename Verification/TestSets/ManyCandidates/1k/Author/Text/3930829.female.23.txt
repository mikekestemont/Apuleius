I'm surrounded by children.&nbsp; Round cheeked, messy, crying children.&nbsp; They enter the daycare wide-eyed and eager to tackle another day of potty training, learning how to pump on the swingset and baking sandbox pies.&nbsp; Some of the moms are my age or younger and I marvel at them as they gracefully detach their children's arms from around their necks and kiss them goodbye.&nbsp;   Sometimes thinking about having a baby scares me.&nbsp; Once they are there, once the line is blue, they are there forever.&nbsp; It will change our lives.&nbsp; Not ruin it like so many other people say, but it will change it.&nbsp; Our cars will need carseats, we'll spend a fortune on stain removal prodcuts, our cats will be jealous, my boobs will feed on demand, everything will have to be baby-proofed.&nbsp; Our routine grocery shopping will be interrupted by the presence of diapers and pacifiers.&nbsp; And then the baby will grow and talk and cry and yell and destroy everything.&nbsp; By the time it reaches adolescence it's purpose will be to hate us.   And yet I'm excited for it!&nbsp; I think what excites me most is the miracle of creation of another human, made by me and the man I love.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Human life is considered the most sacred thing on this planet and we can create it!&nbsp; It's like a majestic rite that everyone can practice, that everyone on earth has in common.&nbsp; Everyone can procreate, everyone&nbsp;can in&nbsp;some form or another begat.   I was just pondering this today.&nbsp; Don't worry, I'm not pregnant.&nbsp; We drank the bottle of Casa Larga Lilac Hill.&nbsp; Everyone loves it.&nbsp; It makes me homesick, merely because it came from Rochester.&nbsp; I miss my little city.&nbsp; Newport is okay. &nbsp;I suppose I could be living in worse places. ;)hehe.   Goodnight everybody.
Moving is such a tedious task.&nbsp; It's so much more than relocating stuff.&nbsp; It involves rediscovery of things you've buried in a forgotten closet, things that fall into the unknown crevices of the furniture, things the cat pushed under the bed.&nbsp; You find yourself dusting not only the dust bunnies in the corner but the cobwebs of your mind.&nbsp;   Something odd I've realized about myself lately is that I'm a closet clean freak.&nbsp; Those that know me and have lived with me are saying, "yeah right" but it's true.&nbsp; I learned this when I started my string of secretary jobs, where the only real skills involved were talking on the phone and organizing things.&nbsp; Turns out, I'd much rather organize things.&nbsp; My first job was pretty boring and the highlight of my day was putting huge piles of work orders in chronological order.&nbsp; I actually found this fun and would get pissy if anyone interrupted me.&nbsp; The second job was slightly more demanding...a lot of writing up documents and running errands.&nbsp; I was the "temp" which basically entitled all full time employees to dump their dirty work on me.&nbsp; Filing seemed to be the time-wasting task everyone despised.&nbsp; In the morning there would be stacks of folders and papers with thank you post-its.&nbsp; I never let on that I actually got off alphabetizing and putting things away in the right places.&nbsp; Maybe I need some pyscho therapy on this one.&nbsp; The  Real Simple &nbsp; magazine has replaced  Cosmo,  each page turn filling me with orgasmic anticipation of how I too can create 33% more living space by storing my cds in archive binders.  So I sit at work daydreaming about this.&nbsp; I begin to "compartmentalize" each room, thinking how I will better organize the things we commonly refer to as "our stuff."&nbsp; We have at least two closets filled with odd-sized, falling apart boxes containing broken pieces of our lives...too ugly to be displayed, too beautiful to throw away forever.&nbsp; The closets are like the graveyards of our past, only visited when trying to regain something we've lost.  I think our closet space would be better suited if things were filed and labeled more specifically.&nbsp; "Jenn's stuff" seems a little broad.&nbsp; But things like  old toys, old schoolwork, wedding memories, unfinished projects and things left unsaid  would be easier to live with.  Red Sox are winning which makes Erik a happy boy.&nbsp; I have Ben and Jerry's in the freezer which makes me a happy&nbsp;girl.&nbsp; (a perfect formula for a happy co-existence) :)  Goodnight.
Allyson moved into the house next door when were very little.&nbsp; We attended Montesorri school together and played JEM and the Holograms outside at recess.&nbsp; We grew up playing Barbies, having crushes on the same boys and sharing the stories of our lives on the bus ride home.&nbsp; We haven't been best friends for years...neighbors grow apart, move apart and move on but the space between us&nbsp;didn't make witnessing her wedding vows any less special.&nbsp; It was the first wedding we've been to since our own.&nbsp; We were supposed to go to two last weekend but circumstances wouldn't allow us to leave the island.&nbsp; Erik and I found ourselves stealing glances, remembering and reliving the extreme happiness of our day.&nbsp; It was our own 3 month anniversary.&nbsp; Just like with our own wedding, I ended up sick the next day and now Erik is as well.&nbsp; Too weary to travel, we put off returning to Newport one more day.&nbsp; Can't say I mind.&nbsp; Rochester has never been so beautiful to me.&nbsp; Everything is in bloom, the yards are all nice and green.&nbsp; We went to the spot with Susan and didn't have to weave in and out of the tourist crowds to get chai.&nbsp; I miss my family the most, but I miss the mall, wegmans, the movie theaters, walking downtown, blading on the canal, getting ice cream at Lickety Splits...all that jazz :)&nbsp; We've agreed to look into moving back after Erik finishes his masters.&nbsp; Until then, we're moving to Dartmouth beginning of September. &nbsp; That's all for the weekend's news.&nbsp; See you next time.
I noticed today how everything in the human body contracts.&nbsp; Our heart contracts, our blood vessels contract, our intestines contract, our muscles contract, our pupils contract o
