We had rolled down into the valley of Maple Springs, New York on Route 430 under a midday overcast that had spit drops of rain for most of the day -- the type of light drizzle that really could deprive the scenery of its slim satisfaction; sort of caving the sky upward and tunnelling towards the apex above. Parking, we got out onto the dampened, beat down hayfield that was Midway Park; its grass lot divided by a thin meshed steele fence that served, almost, as a frame for the structures we were walking out to.    From this point of view, the preoccupied hustle of children and their mundane parents suggested a cautious, unknown expectation for joy, like a crowd to an execution fatefully spread about the landscape waiting for the moment when the rusty nails and seams of the establishment split and collapsed. Nearly unfortunately, the park had died hard, last feeding its need for restoration in 1997, but its real age showed in its 106 year old ingenuity, as if to suggest that someday soon, it would fade to some better place, some amusement park arcadia.     Our purpose in itself was simple enough -- a bite to eat and a temporary glance at Lake Chautauqua; the proverbial meeting ground for the summer faithful of New York's southwest corner, somehow still with an engaging reflection rippling off the water surface, the lake still seemed battered and abused, perhaps begging for some sort of asylum.     The promotion of this old rustbucket was flattering but not entirely original, a plethora of public relation pertaining to the park's history and pasttime, as if to avoid the simple and perhaps more appropriate way to say: "We're old. Really, really old".    Maybe in truth, though, the carnivalistic atmosphere of the grounds was once a bustling place of business and entertainment, I for one remember the lasers show when I was younger, there, and sitting on the grass towards the edge of the road I had been amazed at the simplicity of a few colored lights moving around over the large slide to the back corner.     Exiting, I had mentioned that it seemed like this place was more an excuse than a reason -- as if to say that even as a child now I don't know that I could enjoy the decaying atmopshere and depressed age of the parents overwatching the chaos rumbling about. It was the type of joy I saw in the toddlers eyes who were there, banging away at the pinball machine or racing the line at "The Dragon", that made me question the pureness of the joy that I feel now, or that if it was just in this time that I realized Midway Park's slow and obvious death, and that maybe it was just absent to the eyes of the children who wanted, but moreso needed, that kind of fun...    Directing ourselves to a different type of experiment, we drove over to Audubon: A 600 acre festival of nothing but high grass, woods and rabbit droppings. It had seemed like one of the better places to be in the damp atmosphere; a quiet untapped resource of study that challenged you to dig deep and find cause.     I remember being there in 3rd grade and standing in a field of wild flowers and asking myself at the time what exactly the point was  and where I'd rather be , perhaps on a roller coaster or endulged in a game, but not in school, no, that would make do... But now the land seemed more worthy, and its creatures more interesting. How often do we, as people, stop and look at the things around us?    A slight hike down the trails had led us to a carved out, circular ridge that seemed to look down on the environment below. It was at that point that the one unwelcomed guest to this discovery had crawled up from the woodwork and began to knaw away at the back of my head. Flies, the size of golf balls, or bigger, maybe, batting the top and sides of my face like dull darts launching from a distance.     And like we were intruders, they chased us back to the parking lot batting the back of our heads aimlessly and pointlessly until the reviving sanctuary of pavement caused them to retreat in dismay. This was, in truth, the most disappointing of defeats. To be battered and sent backward by a few relatively small, meaningless objects thats sole point and purpose is to run straight into bright things.     I think I realized, heading back for the evening, that I sort of enjoyed the Audubon more than the cold steele of Midway Park; even though the place was meant for children in the first place, the food and the lake scenery was desirous only within itself, and taken on the only recognizable life of that trip -- a life that begged for it's own end. There was no life in the food, no life in the view, no life in the advertised history of the place that was no more than a scatter plot of machinery anymore.     I don't really think this is some sort of self serving maturation, but rather a testament to the idea that when one puts forth objectivity to the scenery around them, they enjoy it as much as the manufactured pleasure in amusement parks and fairs. I think at this point, I would rather be at a place full of flowers, and water, and life breathing along with me than bathing in concrete.     Maybe those environmentalists were on to something afterall.
What are we? Life is the theme, with death rapped inside. But it's just the story we're playing out -- page by page -- and with the next anything can happen. That is a lateral thought. The world is just like dreams. Anything can happen, because you  truly  don't know from this moment to the next what life brings. Isn't that kind of scary? Think of your heart.
