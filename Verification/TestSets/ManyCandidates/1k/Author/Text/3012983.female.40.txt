Hi all, It's me again. I can't believe that no one has put any SP stories here yet. Wasssup peoples? You certainly can't say you haven't dealt with any lately. If you can, I want to live where you live.   I do have a small comment:  I know that we can do some stupid things even though I consider us IP's. We are just smart enough to tell on ourselves and be the first one to laugh. So this has now happened a few times but I can't help but laugh every time I do it. Did you know when you are missing a limb, especially a lower leg, that it's not there any more? Apparently I don't have this concept. Apparently I think it is invisible or something and it will stop me from landing on my face.  Then yesterday; Haddy gave me a message that I needed to return a call. I swore she said it was Midnight. She (Haddy) told me that the caller left a message about getting some new furniture from our old pastor and his wife. I was so confused, when did she (Midnight) see them or talk to them. So I call Midnight and I start talking about how she did it again. We were thinking about calling each other at the same time.(I was going to call her at that time and tell her to watch a certain TV show but someone was online...)So I am just rambling on and she sounds strange. Finally she said, "I didn't call and leave you a message." "I have no idea what furniture you are talking about." My bad. How stupid do I feel?   Geezzz....Leave it to me. Thank goodness it was Midnight and not some stranger!  When Angel Spirit was here for a visit, she let me copy her Bill Engvall CD's. (the guy who does 'here's your sign') OMG he is so funny! When I listen to him it makes me think of all the stupid things that have come out of my mouth. I will confess eventually. But I am saving them for a rainy day.  May your day be exempt from SP!
*SCREAMS* I HAD to go byebye today and it was horrible!! Every fucking asshole who got their license out of a box of lucky charms is out. I almost puked and cried at the same time. They either couldn't find the gas pedal or the right lane to be in or how to merge onto the interstate. All they accomplished was to thoroughly push me to the brink of murder. Then there were more Semi's then I have seen in a long time. Pulling in front of people, going to slow. I swear them asswipes need their own lane! I NEED A ZANEX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! N O W!!!! *grabs her rifle and loads it*  >whispers
ahhh a haven for common sense!!!! i have plenty to tell...PLENTY!!! today though i am so busy i cant think straight...you would write stories about ME!!! Ill be back...you can count on it...
This was a great idea! *pats herself on the back*  So glad we can all get together and relieve our stress about SP. Tell their stories, share the frustration. I can't wait to read all about it.
Yo all youse peoples, how's it going? I hope  free from SP. I have remembered another commercial that I find insulting: Have you seen these 'drug ads'as in the 'marijuana' ones? This one is two adults yelling at each other through a door. Each one takes a turn as the adult and the kid. They are slamming the door very hard screaming, "It's just a little pot"(child) and "your grounded!"(Adult) then when they are done practicing the adults look at each other and say "Are you ready?" and the other says "Let's do it."  OK...I know that if my hubby and I are slamming doors and screaming at each other, my kids would come and see WTF was g
