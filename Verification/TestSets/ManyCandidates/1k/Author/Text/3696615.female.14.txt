Oh my god. so, in florida here we have this show that airs on UPN at 1 AM called "Live Prayer" Its where people call in with their problems, complaining to a bullshit pastor, and he prays for them, to the lord. Hes basically homophobic, and he thinks being gay will lead to a very destructive road. So, anyway. My online buddy/friend George, lives in Virginia. I usually talk through voice chat with him, and put the mike up next to the tv too. So, I was letting him listen to live prayer, and he decided next time it was on, hed call in, and say he was gay.  So, anyway, i had the mike right next to the TV, and my computer sound recorder ready, and was watching him on cam. So, he had his phone ready, they said he would be through soon, talking to the pastor. And then all of a sudden i heard on TV "Ok, we have George with us. George, what is your  problem?"   George:" Hi, yeah, im gay" (Or something like that)  And the pastor talked about how to help him stop being gay. But there were some seriously funny moments. The priest dude asked george to turn down his tv (he wasnt watching it on the tv, just listening to it through voice chat), so george was like "ok" And then I swear, there was the longest pause ever. The priest dude was waiting for George to say something, and George was waiting for the priest dude to say something. George was like just sitting there, and the pastor had the most confused look on his face, and was staring at the camera. Finally he went "George, are you there?"   And George said "yeah"  And then he went on, preaching about gays, and it was the funniest thing. I was trying to muffle my laughter because i was afraid theyd hear me through the mike. And I kept seeing George giving huge "silent" laughs. And he even typed "lmao" while talking to him.   Then at the very end of the conversation, he prayed for George. George hung up by the time he was praying for him through :-P  Then like two callers later I think, some dude called in talking about himself and... GEORGE! LMFAO! omg.  So, anyway. I recorded the whole thing. Feel free to IM me on aim if ya want to listen to it :-P :-D  God that was some funny shit.
So.. you know what I'm talking about. :-P I'm gonna see that movie tomorrow and wear my anti-gw shirt. Wheee...
Well. I suppose I should start a website now...
Well, more like a journey. I'm going to take my stuffed animal frog with me everywhere I go (including the road-trip my family and I will be going on), so, soon a website will be posted showing all the places hes been to, and what hes done. Today it will be the beach. Hes gonna soak up some rays, but I don't think he'll be going in any water (he doesn't know how to swim yet).   Ok, I better get ready for the beach. Bye.
I'm sorry, but I don't understand how one could support George Bush, or even the entire Republican party for that matter. My social studies teacher was a republican, and she even said "republicans support big business, while democrats support the people." Then why be republican? Why support a party that is more interested in oil than education? Anyway, back to George Bush..  He is one of the worst presidents we've had - if not the worst. He caused the largest deficit in the history of our country, then when confronted about it, all he said was "well, they're wrong." Very smart Georgey boy. Got any facts to back that up? Sheesh.  Most of the times he cant even form complete sentences, and has the worst grammar ever.  "Rarely is the question asked, is our children learning?"  Is they George? Is they? ;-)  He caused an unnecessary war, that 50 percent of america disagreed with, as well as the United Nations, and even George Bush's own father!!  What the fuck could he possibly be thinking? Is he that desperate for war and power?   I'm also tired of people complaining that both George Bush and John Kerry are bad, and so they're just not  going to vote. Think people, just take the time to use your brains. You know... those things in your skulls there. Which one is the better candidate? Which one is against the war? Which one can form complete sentences?  I also wish people would desist from voting for Nader. Whats the point? Hes supported by 5 percent of america. Obviously he wont win the election. Is he there for an ego boost or what? To me hes a little dipshit who should get his ass out of the race, and try not to screw up the election and bring Bush to power yet again.  And why is it that good presidents get assasinated, and the most terrible live long lives? I mean, come on... Lincoln and Kennedy...  At least Reagan (whom I've never liked)  has gone on to a better place (if you can count the underworld as a better place. I certainly can. We've screwed up the "upper" world :-P )  Ok, I'm done ranting.
Perhaps I'm a tad crazy about my clothing. And food..  Anyway. I did a part of my IB work today. I have 1 1/2 pages of notes left for my greek mythology book, then I'll have to read the the lexus and the olive tree. fun. although i dont see what greek mythology has to do with langauge arts...
Pedos s/n = flwbound426     Home phone = 770-844-9542   Since its way too much of a hassle spacing everything, this time I won't be posting the conversation. But anyway, I went on my pedo hunting screen name today, and a fellow by the name of  Cary Hamrick, age 19,&nbsp;of the address 7235 Cox Rd in Cummings, Georgia  IMed me today. He said that h
