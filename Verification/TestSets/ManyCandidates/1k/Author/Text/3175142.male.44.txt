urlLink The Revealer  has a nice piece by Amy Sullivan entitled  urlLink Religious Men , showing how spotty and shallow is the coverage of the religious activities and beliefs of the two major candidates.  I must admit to some curiosity about Ralph Nader's religious inclinations; my guess would be he favors some incarnation of the Earth Goddess, which will only make him more popular among that 3% of the electorate that are already in Nader's column.  I'm still a bit puzzled why religion is shaping up to be a primary issue in the coming election.  There is a pseudo-war going on, after all, and we're in it.  It's not like there is a clamour by the electorate for more discussion of religion in national politics.  So what is driving the steady press coverage that religion is getting?  And will it last through the "serious" phase of the election when people really start listening?
I'm going to add  urlLink Religion in American Life: A Short History   (Oxford Univ. Press, 2003) to my Good Books list, and profile a few  chapters from the middle of the book over the next few days as I read  through them.  I really think familiarity with the evolution of  American religion over the course of the 19th century and the early  20th is the key to understanding American Christianity.    Chapter 8  ("Prophets for a New Nation") - The Revolution was tough on religion--people were just too distracted with the whole affair to devote much attention to religion. There may be few atheists in foxholes, but there aren't many soldiers in chapels either. The break with England also broke with the established Anglican Church. The strong rejection of a national church (if not religion) by the new federal government meant America was undergoing a religious as well as a political experiment under the new Constitution. So there wasn't much continuity with pre-Revolutionary religious life.  After the Revolution, it was a new world.   The dissenting denominations (Puritans/Congregationalists, Baptists,  Prebetyrians) were a presence, as were newer groups like the Methodists and newly independent Episcopalians.  But what is most striking to me (reading this chapter) is the strong attraction of alternative religious institutions for many Americans.    First, Deism was a force.   For example, although Washington was a mildy involved  traditional Christian, he generally referred to God in rather distant terms like Providence, Great Author, or Invisible Hand (p. 176).  "He worshipped irregularly, rarely took Holy Communion . . . and regarded Jesus as a fine man but did not consider him divine" (p. 176-77).  Deism was largely confined to early elites, but that also meant it was highly influential.  Being non-denominational and non-institutional, it could freely contribute (through early leaders) to a sense of civil religion for the government and larger society without running afoul of the No Establishment rule.  Even today, "civil religion" is hardly different from watered down Deism.    Second, Unitarians were an important player in New England.   Early  on, Unitarians were still clearly Christian (I'm not sure what they are  now), but Unitarianism made an obvious break with European Christianity by rejecting original sin and the doctrine of the Trinity.  And read Emerson to get an idea how easily Unitarianism could move towards naturalism, for example.   Unitarians were educated, moral, and the complete antithesis of enthusiastic, emotional, revival  religion that grew stronger over the course of the 19th century.    Third, there were the Masons.   Most Americans just draw a blank when it comes to grasping the role  urlLink Freemasonry  played in American communities in the 18th and early 19th centuries.  Here's a quote that helps:    [Masonry] offered men a form of fellowship different from  ordinary religion, one rich with rituals, special clothes, and secret passwords.  The Masons emphasized brotherhood and fair dealing.  While some embraced Christianity, many others felt that people should outgrow that religion in favor of a more rational and useful one like theirs.  The Masons saw God as a grand architect who designed the universe according to natural law.  Their symbols centered upon the carpenter's square and the compass, building tools that suggested firmness of character (square dealing) and high ideals (aiming high, as the compass pointed toward the sky) (p. 179).  The American fascination with Masonry turned south in 1826 after the  sensational events surrounding the apparent kidnapping and murder of  urlLink William Morgan , a dissident Mason who supposedly disclosed details of the secret Masonic rites.   The  Wikipedia entry for Morgan also contains the cryptic note "Morgan's widow was later one of Mormon founder Joseph Smith, Jr.'s plural wives."   Now there's an interesting link.    Finally, there was stubbornly persistent "folk religion" that continued  to be practiced, largely unobserved.  "They used divining rods to  find water, amulets to ward off evil spirits, and special potions to  stir affection in the opposite sex" (p. 179).    Conclusion -  It was clear quite early on that Americans were  religiously creative and were remarkably unconstrained by traditional  Christian doctrines and practices.  Here, this is evident in a  stunning display of religious diversity, seemingly spilling out over  traditional Christian boundaries almost as soon as the Revolution  ended.  Innovation continued (we will see in Chapter 9) within the  Christian mainstream as new modes of preaching and practice emerged over the course of the 19th century.

There's a  urlLink nice article from NZ  about the difficulties honest priests now face in the wake of the clergy abuse scandals [link from  urlLink The Antipodean ].  This shows how deep the tragedy really goes--everyone loses, both priests and laity, because so much trust has evaporated.
