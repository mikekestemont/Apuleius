My fellow smurfs, today we fight the battle of our lives, and if we go down, we GO DOWN SMURFING.   Ok, sorry, going through my video collection and saw this gem. So of course I had to share it   Due to pending legal action, smurfs may be called blurfs.
urlLink Offbeat Dollars for Scholars : "The annual duck celebration in Stuttgart, Ark., was winding down ? the Queen Mallard beauty pageant was over and the world's best duck dog had been determined. Then Daniel Duke stepped onto the Main Street stage.   Duke, a teenage veteran of more than a dozen duck-calling contests, wowed the judges with his renditions of the four required blasts: hail, feed, comeback and mating. Duke, from the nearby town of Brinkley, triumphed ? and bagged one of the nation's more unusual college scholarships.   'I knew I had a shot at it,' the 19-year-old said of the $1,500 award, which he hopes to use to attend the University of Arkansas. 'And I think it's pretty great you can get a scholarship for calling ducks.'"  --------------------------------------  I couldn't resist sharing this. My father is an Arkansas grad, I may have to call him up and ask if he received any duck hunting scholarships back in the day. Of course he will probably respond that he wasn't able to attend the contest because it was too far to walk in the snow, especially being uphill both ways. After I ask a follow up question, I will be informed that back "in the day" it used to snow in Arkansas even during the winter.
urlLink Northwest Indiana News: nwitimes.com - News: Chew on this : "The gesture was part of an elaborate plan cooked up by boyfriend Magic Mackeigan, who left town Thursday morning on a flight to Texas and was unavailable for comment."   ---------------------------   Ok, so the story is cool and threatened to be my subject. However, check out the boyfriends name. Magic Mackeigan. I bet his parents purchase items sold in spam email messages.
urlLink Spam's dirty little secret - some buy its products : "According to a Yahoo! Mail global survey of about 37,000 Internet users in 11 countries, 20 percent of U.S. residents admit buying products from spam purveyors. About 78 percent said they delete spam."   -----------------------------------  Ok, this is why some people need to be shot. Normally I am not a big advocate of violence, but come one. This means that every company that can get my email address will send me junk, knowing that there is A ONE IN FIVE CHANCE that I’ll buy from them. ONE IN FIVE! That is absurd. Of course if anyone of my loyal readers happens to fall in the category and is offend by my comments..... too bad, I still think you should be shot. Besides we all know that no one reads this, I don’t even read this. (But then who is "we all?")
Hey quick one tonight as I need to be studying. I just wanted to give a quick update and make sure everyone knows that BCOM is the most evil class ever.   There, I feel oddly cleansed now.
urlLink ESPN.com - GEN - ESPN is all the rage ... as a baby name? : "A Texas couple who named their son ESPN after the cable sports network will soon be getting a visit from the toddler's namesake.   An ESPN film crew is coming to this Panhandle town next month to interview the family of 2-year-old ESPN Malachi McCall for a feature on several children around the country named after the network.   ESPN (pronounced Espen) McCall is one of at least three children in the United States known to be named for the sports network. A couple in Corpus Christi named their son Espn Curiel in 2000, the same year Espen Blondeel was born in Michigan."   ----------------------------------------------------------------  Wow, and I thought the name Asa was weird.... just kidding bud. However this article has provided me with inspiration. My first kid will be name Pepsi Coke Luttrell. Think about it, it works perfectly. Then all I will have to do is convince him (or her, doesn't really matter) to get a PhD and then the name will be Dr. Pepsi Coke Luttrell.    And yes, its official now, I will never show this blog to any girl that I meet.
WOW, when we last talked, I had a full head of vibrant hair.&nbsp; That’s right, Vibrant.&nbsp; However, the combination of Falls Creek and YFN was just too much for it.&nbsp; For now, all of my beautiful vibrant hair lies in a trash bag somewhere in Dallas.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Now, for those of you who are constantly looking for&nbsp;a reason to laugh at me (Martin, I'm looking at you and your group right now) I will post pictures as soon as I can, hopefully before leaving on vacation this coming Thursday.  &nbsp;  Now to get serious.&nbsp; YFN was great.&nbsp; I consider it a great honor for God to allow me to see Him move twice in two weeks, and I pray that these experiences carry over into future youth meetings.&nbsp; I should probably type more than that, but I'm tired, so............. BUGGER OFF!!!!!&nbsp;
urlLink    Yeah, so really Im just testing this, but come on. Who couldn't use a little more Huddy in thier lives? Except american league batters that is.
QUICK, click  urlLink HERE     Ok, with that out of the way, let me tell you about last week. Last week I had the privilege of attending Falls Creek with Glenstone Baptist Church. This was I believe my 9th year at Falls Creek, being a sponsor for six of those. Although I am cheating on one of the years, I only spent a day and a half at FC last year and I was probably technically a guest, but in my eyes I am always in charge so who cares.   Hey, back to what is important. We had 3 salvations last week, which was awesome, and if any of those three are reading this, I want you to know I am proud of you and praying that you c
