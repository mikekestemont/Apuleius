I was chatting to Libby on msn today - it has been great catching up. With the time difference, I'm usually slaving away at school when she's online, and with her doing the HSC and me the IB, we've gotten soooo busy! So I think the new mode is to have a blog, and Libby twisted my arm into getting one - saying, "at least just to keep me updated!"  There you have it - a blog to see into my little hobbit hole. My posts might be deep &amp; meaningful, random or pointless, so take them or leave them. love you all!

When I was at Howard's and Freddy's there was this terrible programme on TV. It was a talk show between a  urlLink gay  man and a Christian. Thing is, the way it happened, it made the Christian sound horrible. It made Christianity look like a prison...and this is the image that everyone gets of Christianity. :(. It frustrated me SO much. Also, at  urlLink school  I'm so not open about my faith...I don't know if its because I'm worried what  urlLink people  will think of me, of if its just because God is such a taboo word at  urlLink school  ? hmmmmm
I worked at Nyon Hopsital today. I am exhausted! I arrived at 8am, got suited up (I looked sooo professional!) and then off I went. I really enjoyed it, and I had a certain peace about it, that I know that Physiotherapy is the thing for me. (I have lots of pros and cons about it:) ) I spent most of the day with Boris, a hot Physio, heehee, and he was really great. He taught me some stuff during  urlLink free  moments, and techniques etc. Although, at one point since I was his "belle assisante Ecossaise", (for some reason he didn't call me Anglaise) a lady had come in because she has a handicapped friend and he was teaching her how to get him in and out of  urlLink wheelchairs , so I was the guinea pig :) haha - I wasn't complaining! ;) I also worked with two women: Anne and Mireille, who were both very nice. I did some work up in the geriatrics ward, where there was a guy called Francoise around my age who was Nurses' Age, who again, was very attractive, and we had a good  urlLink time  lifting nice old ladies out of their  urlLink beds  and for a walk along the corridor!! I also worked a bit in the soins intensif, which was quite sad :(. So yes, I had a good day!
back again...it was a lonnnnnng holiday! The first week, in Scotland, was exhausting :) We saw a lot of my Aunt Jean & Uncle Roddy, with their kids: Alison (8), Ross (5) and Jamie (2). (A LOT of  urlLink free  babysitting). Don't get me wrong, they're great kids, but all day, almost every day, of, "Lindsey, Lindsey, Lindsey, can we have another race?". We saw all the relatives: grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, and 2nd cousins (two 2-year olds). I  urlLink love  my grandparents'  urlLink house  tho, a great big victorian  urlLink house  :) Very authentic.  We then went to Ipswich in East Anglia and stayed with my uncle Rodney &amp; aunt Tracey. Their two boys are Howard (18) and Freddy (17) - yes Libby they are both quite good looking young men (or so my  urlLink friends  have told me) (Howard's off to Nottingham Uni to study Mathematics this october! :) But another four days of my brother, freddy and howard...(aaaaaaahhh!) I do have some amusing  urlLink video  footage of them doing wacky dives into their outdoor pool (Yes, we went swimming in their open-air outdoor swimming pool, in ENGLAND!) (They also have a  urlLink tennis  court). Its unfair tho, because I'm older than Freddy, and he's driving because in the UK you can get your licence at 17, and I can't drive yet :P Oh well. We saw the Bourne Supremacy, which wasn't as godo as the first one, but still was quite seat-gripping. So yes, I am glad to b
