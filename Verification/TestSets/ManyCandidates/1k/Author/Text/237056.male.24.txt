what?  BOZO AS IN CLOWN OR...  So, I read  urlLink Africa Adorned  last night and - despite having seen a fair share through rachel's influence - was  blown away  by the Tuareg pieces.  It made me want to get some wax and metals and create lots of cool things (since, it seems, most of what I like resembles what I'm trying to do).  Guess it's that age-old trap though, the poor person mantra: "If I only had the money I could..."  I appears that the only way to escape that cycle is to  actually remember  what you want to do once you have the money, rather than washing it away in the daily grind.  Nonetheless; I berated myself for thinking "only if" and longing after gas torches and plaster, yet at the same time, adoring photos of people performing my desired tasks with clay and wood fires.  Thusly sparked with the necessity to prove to myself that I wasn't as bad as I thought I was, I tore up some old tea candles (thin, flimsy aluminium), flattened them out by hand (a long process) and played around with some designs...  Needless to say, they weren't anything special, but sometimes little moments like that can give you all the fire you need to make those moments last longer next time.    For an example of what my tea-light experiments  didn't  look like, click  urlLink here     Meanwhile, I've also added a little email form in the  urlLink contacts page .  Please give it a go, if you really must spam it, let me know before hand so I can redirect the mail to childe...  Categorised image gallery thingo coming up next - it's nearly done but I stopped working on it to write a calendar script for rachel (I'll post it to the public domain after a bit of ironing)  This whole  urlLink tribe.net  thing is interesting to me - don't get me wrong, it  is  just another piece of "social software," but it feels a lot more like the  Good Ol' BBS Days  than most of the web-based BulletinBoardSystems, small communities, like interests...  Everything except files..      I'm working on another language (how many are there? I've lost count (and fluency)) which has deeeeeep symbolism, it's helping me to appreciate how well put together certain linguistic and majiqal systems are. Most languages or alphabets can be designed pretty quickly if you have a goal in mind (beauty or efficiency of script, for example; or even established thought patterns, philosophies and memes to be embedded in it's structure (and thus, carried through into the speaker)) but this one is proving to be quite an interesting puzzle.   I can't really go into much more detail without having to go into  too much  detail at this point, but I'm essentially building the language all willy-nilly.  I'm starting with interlocking symbol systems which form a set of wheels (this is a visual structure to aid my memory, sort of a memory cathedral), the intersections between low-level symbols define higher-levels, which in turn create even higher ones... etc.. I'm about a 3rd of the way there and other than the base elements, their names and most of the low-level symbols, I have no idea what the language will be like.  Dabbling in linguistics was so much easier when I only thought in romance languages and german.  I've been poking around in hebrew and arabic books here and there, a little thai on special occasions and it has simultaneously ( and  at the same time) fascinated me and ruined me. It becomes very clear how much language influences our view of the world, learning another language is like NLP++ in my opinion, but yes, this is a well-beaten path which I will come back to some time. It's ruined me in the sense that there are too many cooks upstairs at the moment - the information hasn't been fully integrated and is just bouncing around burning eggs and bumping into people - which is a great state for brainstorming, but not for calmly combing order through a concept...  any thoughts?   Pentaphobe slopes off wondering how many thoughts he left open, if anyone will notice, if if so, whether they'll close them up so the flies don't get in.
Pentaphobia is slowly growing (not so's you'd notice) into a web-site. In the absence of any real programming or music making, my few moments on Rachel's computer have recently been spent making a new backend for the page. Most of it is still in the early stages and is set aside for me to play with.  If you get the urge, take a look in  urlLink the audio section  which I'm currently playing with ( comments and criticisms appreciated  though bare in mind that I haven't put any work into the visual interface, that'll come later)  I was also going to upload a whole lot more music, but I have to arrange an mp3 encoder on this machine first - not too long now, I have another coupla hundred that are pretty good, a few dozen that are AWESOME and a couple that are so good that I'm keeping them to myself (they'd just make the other tracks look bad).  I also just made some really nice pesto, I'm going to go eat some of it now.
was just playing about with my new proc fan (thermaltake volcano 11+.. i recommend it) ;;)  funny thing about sound is that you only hear the loudest sound from any given source at any given frequency.. so, for example, when you replace your noisy processor fan with a nice, new, quiet one, the sounds it was masking (like the less-noisy-but-twice-as-annoying bios fan) rise to the surface of the sound spectrum.. so, now my pc makes less noise (and is about 9 degrees cel cooler), but it's sound signature scores somewhat higher in the annoying category..   oh well, and excuse to spend more money ::D  gideon^
Oh I hear you so very loud and clear..   it's not so much an american thing as a workin' thing, imho.. i d
