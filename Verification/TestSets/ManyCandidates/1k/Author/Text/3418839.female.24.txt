I am still recovering from the wedding and the after math of saturday night...always a good time!  So i worked tonight will melissa...made some cash...which i wasn't expecting....but hey it's all good. so tomorrow is memorial day.  I was plannin on goin surfin' and maybe doin' a little fishing...but the weather is looking a little shitty and I think we're gonna scratch that.  But as always the party must go on, so we're contemplating what to do tomorrow night.  So many choices, so little time.  I'm sure we'll come up with something good.  After all it is a holiday...which is one more reason to party...hehe.  So the plans seem to be homewrekin' (as I like to call it) with Deedee and a crew that seems to vary from time to time.  Still not sure what the final destination will be, but there are many options none the less.  OH, and let me just tell you about my stalker! I now have more than one bar stalker.  Amusing, but scary at the same time.  Not sure how to handle the situation, but i'll come up with something eventually.  At least I have off tomorrow and I can contemplate something for the future.  Guys are weird, and I'm not sure of their thinking...but stalking is really not good.  I"m sure of that! well, it's late and I need to be getting some rest before the rest of today begins...I'm sure i'll have another fucked up blog to share, along with some fabulous pics...hahaha. Speaking of which I can't wait to get my pictures developed! u'll see soon enough. Along with that I would also like to say, that deedee has written a kick ass song, that describes a good part of my life as well.  I'll share it with you when she gives me the proper permission and copy right laws...haha. goodnight!
and I like the lyrics...kinda spells my life out sometimes...  Don't Stay  Sometimes I need to remember just to breathe Sometimes I need you to stay away from me Sometimes I’m in disbelief I didn’t know Somehow I need you to go  Don’t stay Forget our memories Forget our possibilities What you were changing me into Just give me myself back and Don’t stay Forget our memories Forget our possibilities Take all your faithlessness with you Just give me myself back and Don’t stay  Sometimes I feel like I trusted you too well Sometimes I just feel like screaming at myself Sometimes I’m in disbelief I didn’t know Somehow I need to be alone   I don’t need you anymore, I don’t want to be ignored I don’t need one more day of you wasting me away I don’t need you anymore, I don’t want to be ignored I don’t need one more day of you wasting me away With no apologies
This weekend was Melissa's mother's wedding...The wedding itself was very simple in a park in Cartert.  Charming...reminded me that if, god forbid, I ever get married, it's gonna be a small thing.  I'd like to have a little something barefoot on the beach and then a big reception...cause that's the good part! And let me just tell you...the reception was fun!  Melissa's family is just about as much disfunctional as mine, so we get along..haha.  There was definately too much alcohol! We were all trashed, dancing and attempting to video tape the occassion.  Should show to be funny tapes to watch!  Today was mostly a series of hangovers and trying to clean up this mess in the apt.  which is still in major progress as we speak.  Of course we're gonna go get a beer and chill in a little while...(can't not drink on a saturday night, with no work!!!) All in all the weekend was kick ass, and I'm looking forward to doin' some surfin' on Monday.  Pigfucker...aka DD will be joining me to jam down the shore and chill on the beach.  I'm gonna have to check up on the surf reports to see if it's even worth bringin the surfboard and wetsuit all the way down there.  Got my fingers crossed though!
So today I had the pleasure of working all fucking day...fun fun. I made some good money though, and rocked the resturants sales with my "u suck" ratings...haha! Melissa moved her shit in today... so the apt. is even a bigger mess! My girlfriend also had the pleasure of rolling around in my bed trying to pick up my scent...I find this funny and intriguing. On the other hand, this weekend is showing to be a very very interesting one.  I've got the wedding tomorrow complete with hotel room, open bar and shuttles...what more could you ask for! I do have to get up rather early which sux, but it's all good and will be worth it. I even get to get my hair did! JOY!  I'm sure i'll have lots of pics to show everyone how badly we were fucking up!  The bonus is no fucking fridays! At least until Sunday. But that's ok, cause Monday is surfing day!!!!! It will be the first time I'm going out this season...I'll try and avoid the sharks this time...hehe, but I can't promise anything!  Well, I gotta go find my dress and shoes and shit and start packin' stuff up for the weekend...we'll talk again on Sunday, maybe....if I live through the weekend :)
So last night was fun. We all gathered at Lazy Lanagans for cocktails...i said cock, yeah so anyways, sandy decided to drink heavily...like it's anything new! I spilt a jack and ginger all over melissa...in the beginning of the night, I wasn't even buzzed yet! So we proceded to go into the bathroom and attempt to exchange pants. yeah, didn't go as planned seeing how she wears pants that are two sizes smaller than mine, but we did find out we were wearing the same underwear only in different colors!  rock on! so the end of the night comes, i'm stupid retarded and got scooped up by Christian and taken home.  From that point on t
