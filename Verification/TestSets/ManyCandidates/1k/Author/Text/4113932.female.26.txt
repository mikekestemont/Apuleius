urlLink    my favorite beverage now  urlLink     I started drinking coffee when I was 4th year college. I needed it to be awake ‘till the wee hours of the night for me to squeeze in everything that has to be done in a day (well, until 4am!) 24 hours seemed not enough for me to finish my school works, it was just so excruciating! But do I have any choice? Honestly, coffee helped me passed college (especially my thesis) with flying colors! *laughs*  Since then, I’ve been a coffee drinker. It kept me going at work. Being in a fast-paced multinational company like HP, I needed something to make myself a key player to the team. Coffee and  yosi , nice combination. Energy-booster. Then, it became a habit. Until this article caught my attention...  Listen up, coffee drinkers! This is an excerpt from the article of Lipton's ad. I have to agree with this. =)   You know that it’s all in your mind---small decisions here and there that multiply faster than you think, lifelong dreams that sometimes seem so real and yet in a split second seem to wander off completely. You know your mind can one day be a mine of ideas and suddenly a mountain of data. So what better way to begin any hurdle than having things clearer in your head? At the end of the day, it all boils down to having a clear mind.  There’s a world of difference between simply looking and truly seeing, between hearing and listening, between capturing information and crystallizing ideas. When your head is clear, it means you’re in place and everything around you falls in place as well. It means your feet are on the ground---you’re quiet but strong, you’re calm but collected. It also means you’re alert and ready to take on anything on your path.  And the secret to a clear mind is no rocket science, and follows no mind-boggling formula. It’s as simple as a cup of tea. Yup- it’s time to turn a new leaf and experience the power of tea. Like the rest of the world, you well know that Tea is good for your body- but are you aware of the wonders that tea can do to your mind?  Research has finally named the secret that has linked tea with mental vitality. It’s called Theanine and it’s found almost exclusively in the tea plant. Not a lot of people may know what it is but Theanine is certainly one of the big reasons why more and more are turning to tea nowadays as their beverage of choice.  Scientific research had validated the link between Theanine and a perfect state of calmness. Theanine is the very reason why you’re not a hyperactive when you drink tea as compared to when you drink coffee. But it’s also the reason why you don’t feel sleepy when drinking tea. In short, it’s the Theanine in your cup of tea that calms you in just the right way to put you in place and bring you to your “comfort zone”. And just as you’re perfectly settled, Theanine raises your level of mental alertness by stimulating your brain to increase its production of alpha brain waves. The effect is higher mental focus, better concentration and sharper memory. Studies have also pointed out how Theanine could effectively promote creativity. Now that’s when the miracle of Theanine unfolds. The unique combination of relaxation and alertness, of increasing mental sharpness while at your most comfortable state of mind and body, results in this renewed clarity of thought and mental vitality. Cup after cup after cup, the power of the leaf brings you to your natural groove.
urlLink    Xmas party 2003.  Xave is really fun to be with. With all his hilarious gestures & dance steps, funny songs na pang kalma nya sakin lalo na kapag nagiinit na ulo ko at mga kakengkoyans na pang asar nya, I just can't help but laugh &amp; laugh in the middle of our petty quarrels. It's really hard to hide my smiles and laughters kahit na serious at galit na ako. Kainis! As we mature, grow individually and grow as a couple the more we turn out to be "  good friends  ". We feel so lucky that we are not just    in a relationship    but we're also the   BEST OF FRIENDS  . I never had qualms telling him what's on my mind and what I'm feeling 'coz I know he listens and talks with his heart and no matter what happens, he would accept me for what and who I am. It's such a happy feeling! This guy is a   TRUE FRIEND  , lucky are those who are friends with him. He thinks of other people first before himself. Sensitive. Sincere. Sweet. Protective. Loves his friends and family. A metrosexual---we enjoy doing "sort-of-vain things together": footspa, going to the salon, trying out new hair wax, serum, shine control gel, skin care and more other stuffs. I love this person!!! =)  urlLink

I just want to share with you. I could definitely relate!   This is an excerpt from article of Dana Hernandez in the August issue of Cosmopolitan. Read on…   “Deliriously happy couples haven’t been blessed by the love gods---they’ve just adopted certain habits that keep their twosomes tight. Crib their relationship rules.”  “Deeply connected couples aren’t born. They’ve simply mastered certain principles that strengthen their link and maintain that initial magic.  Some women expect their man to posses romantic ESP but unless he’s been tuning in to Oprah, he won’t be able to decipher what’s bugging you and he’ll be pissed off that you’re expecting him to figure it out. Rock-solid couples however, dispense with the guessing games and vocalize exactly what’s eating them. Blissful relationships are built on strong communication, which means telling each other your thoughts and explaining what you want or need without pulling punches. F
