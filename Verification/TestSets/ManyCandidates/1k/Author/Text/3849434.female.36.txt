Wheww! I made it through another work week. OK enough about work.           Our family had the best time yesterday afternoon.  Matthew made it back from his mission trip to St. Louis in one piece.  He'd been gone all week.  He said he had a great time and met lots of friends and has already been on line to add them to his messenger.  It's pretty cool.          Also, we had our Minnesota friends stop by on their way home from Florida and got to feed them.  It's so neat how the Lord allows for paths to cross sometimes.  Can it get much better to be in Kentucky and have chicken, fried taters, green beans and homemade chocolate ice cream? naaaaaaah not on earth but it can when we get to heaven.            Today is a good day.  We have slept a couple of extra hours and getting breakfast ready. We only have to do what WE WANT to do today. It's GREAT for a change!          Matthew is already off to go play "paintball" with his friends for a birthday party.  He has been looking foward to this for 3 weeks.            Til next time,     NurseKellySpeaking
What a day it has been but what a glorious hallelujah shoutin' day that will be when I finish the race and see MY LORD and SAVIOR Jesus.       &nbsp;   We had a 3 hour supervisors meeting today.&nbsp; I might add it was "unannounced" like most of them are these days.&nbsp; It's just a norm.&nbsp; The outcome of the meeting once again left my head spinning, frazzled and upset.&nbsp; I did cry but it wasn't tears of "my feelings are hurt" they were "tears of anger".&nbsp; Something has to be resolved and quickly.&nbsp; I just know that things will get better I just have to hang in there like a hair in a bisquit. You know really I wish I had a lawyer friend that I could discuss this issue with to see where I stand legally.&nbsp;        &nbsp;   In the mean time, I have my eyes and ears open for a day shift Monday - Friday position somewhere.&nbsp; I don't know what the Lord has in store for me.&nbsp; He may just want me to stay where I'm at then again it may be time for me to leave.&nbsp; I will try to "wait upon the Lord" and NOT bring this home too much and NOT let it get me down.&nbsp; I will continue to do the best job I can do when I am there and then leave it there when I leave.       &nbsp;   Matthew is still in ST Louis.&nbsp; Has he called home to see check in? NOOOOOOOooooooOOO he's 13. lol I know he is safe and I'm sure he's having a blast.&nbsp; I can't wait for him to come home.       &nbsp;   It's supper time...       &nbsp;     &nbsp;   Til next time,     NurseKellySpeaking
Why is it that when you go to work that the employer thinks that everything in your life has to be secondary to the family?&nbsp; I am a good employee.&nbsp; I am dependable, trustworthy, and considerate of my co workers.&nbsp; The place I work now has been such a culture shock to me.&nbsp; My co workers look at me as the "religious lady" but that's not what I am trying to protray. I have always tried to be myself no matter what.&nbsp; Sometimes this&nbsp;has caused people to refer to me as Ms Goody Goody, which I absolutely HATE.&nbsp; Anywho,&nbsp; the place where I work now I feel as been very challenging for me..in some ways I have given into the tempations of the world and that makes my heart sad.&nbsp; There's no getting back what you "use" to have with the Lord when you give in to the sin.&nbsp; I mean He will forgive you but the relationship will still be tarnished with the sin that nags behind. I pray that I have not been a stumbling block to any of my co workers and that if I have I can try to be a better witness to them.       &nbsp;   My current employer terminated my position last October.&nbsp; I was laid off for 5 months then I went back to the same employer in a different position.&nbsp; The stress is so much more than what it was and I felt the Lord lead me back there. The first month I cried nearly every day because I just didn't feel I knew what I was doing and didn't feel like I was accomplishing anything.&nbsp; I almost left there and went to another facility but didn't have complete peace about the move so I stayed.       &nbsp;   Well, currently the "big bosses" are doing a cost analysis on my position but assured me that they weren't looking to "cut" it but we all know that we can't believe what "big bosses" say because that's the same sorta speech I got last October the day before I got canned. So anyway, there is lots of stresss with my job.&nbsp; I interview nurse aides, teach nurse aide classes, employee health, cpr classes, department specific orientation on all employees, skin assessments, help in dining room 2 hours a week, work at Salem "helping out", fill in on the floor when needed.&nbsp; The stess just wears me out.&nbsp; I have people fussing at me saying the new nurse aides don't know what they are doing and that it's my fault and that I should do something about it.&nbsp; I have my boss coming to me saying that "the other nurses" don't feel that I am pulling my load and need to help them more but wouldn't tell me who the "other nurses are.&nbsp; I have tried to be a positive team player and do what was asked of me without fussing too much but enough is enough.&nbsp; Last time I was "on call" I worked 60 hours that week.&nbsp; This week I was on call and&nbsp;I had already put in 41 hours in 3 days so I felt I had given all to CHS that I could give for the week.&nbsp; Needless to say the "
