Yesterday I sat in church, and despite being very interested in Graeme's thoughts on why we should stop sinning if we know in advance we will be forgiven, my mind kept wandering off on it's own.  I so rarely have that very focussed "I'm on the ball" feeling anymore.  I wonder if it is an age thing or just that I am tired.  Hard to say.  G actually slept through the night on Saturday, so I should have been hopping mentally on Sunday, but I wasn't.  B was wicked Sunday afternoon, and took a paracetamol capsule I had put on the table and ate it.  I put it down, went and picked up G, came back to have them, and the little toad had snavelled them, and eaten one, holding the other in her hot little hand.  Rang the Poison's Info Hotline for the second time in 8 days.  I wonder how long it takes for them to sic DOCS onto you?  Apparently one paracetamol for a 2 year old won't do irreparable damage.  Lucky.  She really is a ratbag.  We spent the weekend working on the hammock for G.  It is up and running now, and she is lying in it sleeping as I type.  It's just magic, I am so pleased with it.  J did a beautiful job on the hanger,and the sling bit which I ran up looks quite fine too.  But the best thing is she likes it.  What's not to like?  It looks so comfy, the boys both asked if they could have one.  J rang a little while ago, he has been perusing the real estate pages and found a beautiful house inBlaxlnad.  So much for the extension.  Although the way I feel with the very cramped conditions in this house, I would be happy to move.  Well sort of.  I love it here, I love the boys being able to walk to school, I love the neighbours, and the street, and everything really, except the house is too small.  We are absolutely crammed into such a weeny space.  6 people in three (small) bedrooms, and one bathroom.  The toilet issue is a pretty big one actually.  However did the Brady Bunch manage?  Still getting organised for the business launch.  I made a sleeping bag/blankie thing for G yesterday, and took it out this morning to M&M's (good advertising), it was much admired, and I suspect I will get some business if I can strike while the proverbial iron is hot.  Must get my bum into gear.  Is bum a proper swear word?  I m trying to stop swearing.  It's a very bad example to the boys, and I really don't want them to do it.  Trying to cut saying "frig" to.  It's such an ugly word, and quite satisfying, but I heard D say it on the weekend, and its not a bit nice.  There are chocolate biscuits in the fridge that I am trying not to eat.  I am tired of being fat, I know I like it much better when I am not as heavy as I am now.  And when I'm breastfeeding, I do shed the weight fairly easily (well comparatively), so I should just get to and do it, instead of putting it off.  It's so boring though.  Went to visit Nell on Friday afternoon, little Stephanie has lost her newborn look, and is starting to look like a person, instead of squashy and wierd (as all newborns do look).  Nell is such a lovely woman, its been nice to get to know her better.  Might go look at these realestate pages, see if there is anything I like, less amazing but cheaper than what J found.
While I sympathise with public educators in Australia, having been one of them, I am less than impressed with strikes.  Is there not a better way to get their point across.  Today has been ok, but next Wednesday is a headache.  I have a gynaecologist apointment that I absolutely cannot take the boys too, for their sakes as well as mine. SO I have to organise someone to take care of them.  One of the disadvantages of a big family is locating baby sitters, who besides Grandparents is going to want to take on my tribe?  Anyway, GrannieAnnie has jumped at the chance to be with them, so it's not  all bad, except for not wanting to share with her what I'm up to.  "A Doctor's Appointment"  will hopefully suffice as an explanation, she surely couldn't ask for specifics?  I say this, but after 12 years, I tend to expect the worst from her.  At least then I can be pleasantly surprised.  This morning we went to visit J at Chez H.  D went to Ryan's house.  I always has to be "doing", it is not enough to simply "be", so I thought it would be nice to arrange something that I would enjoy too.  And it was.  B was much nicer today than earlier in the week, though when I told her before we departed that she wasn't allowed to push Emerald over today, she said "oohhhhh", in that voice that means "why ever not?"  SHe did behave better, and only pushed her once that I saw.  Oh, and ran her down with the push along car.  I guess the perfect baby would inevitably grow up to be like every other toddler, but its still a bit of a shock, she has hitherto been delightful, and while I tried hard not to be smug about her delightfulness, I was deep down.  Serves me right, it's come back to bite me on the bum now.  Weather has turned, and while I do like being cooler, after 9 months of feeling overheated, I am remebering why I have never liked being cold.  Its nasty.  G has already expressed her distaste for windy weather, it makes her grumpy.  On another track, I wonder if the overheating in pregnancy is indicative of how many hot flushes I will suffer when I go through The Change (many y
