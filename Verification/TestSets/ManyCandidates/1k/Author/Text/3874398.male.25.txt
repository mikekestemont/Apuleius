3 Dingers from Albert in an amazing come from behind win against the Cubs.  unfortunately the story is very familiar--the Redbirds' offense bails out the starting pitching.&nbsp; I weary of my Doom and Gloom, fire and brimstone, Jonathan Edwards impression, but we need a dominate starter.&nbsp;   Could the old adage be wrong?&nbsp; "Good pitching beats good hitting."&nbsp; Can you have good enough hitting to overwhelm the best pitching available?&nbsp; If the Card's stay as is, we will see a whether it holds true.  -CJ
8 IP 4ER...not too shabby.&nbsp; Still 4 ER.&nbsp; The Cardinals are still relying on scoring a ton.&nbsp; Please let me be wrong, but I still feel the Cardinals will come crashing back to Earth soon.&nbsp;  &nbsp; On another note, Zambrano, regarding his second pitch that hit Edmonds: "Meanwhile, Zambrano insisted he wasn't trying to hit Edmonds, that he was just trying to 'make my pitch and the ball went out of my hand.'"&nbsp;  &nbsp; Anyone who saw that game would tell you it was no accident.&nbsp; This reminds me of when my mother asked my little brother, Joey, &nbsp;if he pooped his diaper.&nbsp; Looking her straight in the face he said, "Daddy did it."&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, Zambrano and his attitude just plain stink.&nbsp; Hopefully his "accidents" won't get someone seriously injured in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp; -CJ
urlLink Johnson Rumors   &nbsp; -CJ
1. Roger Cedeno ($5.4 Million)-Is this not the most expensive non-everydayer?&nbsp; What an unfortunate bust.&nbsp; I have no idea how we could unload this guy.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  2. Matt Morris ($12.5 Million)-Matt ain't what he used to be (altough he pitched decently yesterday).&nbsp; He definitely isn't worth over 1/8 the team payroll.&nbsp; It pains me to say this, but I seriously doubt Matt will be with us next year.&nbsp; &nbsp;-CJ
"The Cardinals need someone to be able to put up all zeroes on occasion -- Morris has been a disappointment there...The pitching staff is serviceable, but not spectacular. Upgrades will be needed if they really expect to hold off the Cubs' charge.  The stars are aligning (Wood, Prior and Sosa off the DL) for (the Cubs)...a serious second-half run at the vulnerable Cardinals, who might eventually show chinks in their rotation."  -Eric Mack SportsLine.com Staff Writer  I am the homely man, unshaven, and dirty holding a sign saying, "Repent the End is near--if we don't aquire more pitching."  My friend Peter White, http://www.all-baseball.com/marinermusings, made sure to tell me not to be too picky.  However, when your team has been playing way above itself you want to make sure your team stays there.  More's the pity for the hapless Mariners.  The Cardinals desperately (maybe not obviously) need a shut-down man in the rotation. -CJ
Who has the best record per money spent? Where do our small Midwestern finches stand?   "You gotta spend money to make money."  In the case of MLB you have to spend money to make championships.  The following stats are Winning % divided by millions spent for 2004.  Teams want to have a higher WPPM, but as you will see, teams that are not willing to be bargain hunters will probably wind up playing in October.  Current Standings:  NL Central  WPPM    Cardinals    7.7 Cubs         5.9 Reds        12.4 Brewers     18.7  Astros       6.8 Pirates     11.3  NL East     WPPM Phillies     5.7 Braves       5.8 Marlins     12.2 Mets         5.3 Expos        8.3  NL West     WPPM Dodgers      6.2 Giants       6.7 Padres       8.3 Rockies      6.0 DBacks       5.0  AL Central  WPPM White Sox    8.1 Twins       10.0 Indians     13.8 Tigers       9.7 Royals       7.6  AL East     WPPM Yankees      3.5 Red Sox      4.7 DRays       16.7 Blue Jays    8.7 Orioles      9.2  AL West     WPPM Rangers      9.7 Athletics    9.1 Angels       5.3 Mariners     4.8        So where does a team draw the line?  The Yankees spend more than anyone, but they're winning.  Cardinals are doing great at 7.7 and have the 2nd best record in baseball.  The Twins are only 2 games out.  They're WPPM is much higher than their division rival ChiSox.  Are the Twins' owners willing to drop their WPPM so as to increase the one stat that does matter PCT?  Question for Walt Jockety:  Are you willing to decrease the WPPM just a little bit in order to help shore up a vulnerable rotation? -CJ
I know that one bad outing by Carpenter doesn't automatically make me right.  But...  "Chris Carpenter has the best record at 9-3. Like I said I want to be wrong, but Carpenter will probably not keep up this pace." -July 10, 2004  The Cardinals witnessed first hand the old adage, "Good pitching beats good hitting."  Kerry Wood's dominance of the Cardinals through 5 innings (Baker being careful on Wood because he just came off the DL) is just a taste of the power a dominate pitcher brings to the table.  St. Louis has 1. Hitting 2. Bullpen (So far) 3. Speed 4. Fielding 5. Power, but not a dominate starter.  Matt Morris is extremely streaky, and unfortunately can no longer be counted among baseball's top tier of SP's.    Pipe dream of the week: acquire Randy Johnson.  He would look very "Ek" like in the Cardinal uni.   -CJ

Five relievers combined on hitless relief the final three innings. Isringhausen got five outs for his 21st save in 25 chances. The bullpen has allowed two earned runs in the last 29 innings."
I want to be wrong.  Please let me be wrong.  But Cardinal pitching is overachieving and it seems to be only a matter of time before we all come crashing b
