I've been in the hospital since monday.  There's still some confusion about what was wrong with me but the best guess is that I had an ovarian cyst that ruptured and caused an infection.  I'm still taking medication to help with the pain.  Trying to wean myself off of it though.  I woke up this morning with pain off the chart.  I was completely disoriented because it hurt so much.  I wandered the hall crying for a bit before I found a nurse who took me back to my room and helped me.  At any rate when I woke up I took a shower and felt a lot better.  Eventually Dr Brown came in and told me I could come home today.  Catherine dropped me off and got the rest of my medicine.    Its so nice to be home with the boys.  My own bed. And a nightgown that closes in the back.  Getting the pick line out was the best thing.  I have a huge hole in my arm though.  I didn't expect that.    ANYway... Lani and I are going to go to the interview on the coast on Sunday.  I'm very torn.  I think I would love the dispatch center there, I know I like the area, but I would miss my friends.  Being sick really drove that point home.  But my family would be there, and I'd make new friends.  I can see myself living there for the rest of my life.  Also a strong selling point...  I guess the only thing to do is to go to the interview and see how things go.  If they offer me the position then it was meant to be, otherwise I'll keep plugging away here.    I am most definitely doing something about my weight though.  Its completely out of hand, and for the first time I couldn't do something because my ass was too big.  So tomorrow I'm going to call and withdraw from my classes.  I'm too far behind and really don't think I'll be able to catch up.  Especially if this job comes though I've just got too many things to worry about.  In place of that I'll be going to the swim center.  Not really having an appetite for the past week also helped get me started.    Expect progress reports.
I've been sick the past week or so.  No gory details but I've been on lots of pain killers and sleeping a lot to try and get over it. There are a couple of things which have been very scary.  Mostly though it reminds me of when I had my cyst before and how helpless I felt.  There really isn't anything you can do to get better. It just takes time for the body to heal itself, and pain medication  to help you sleep so that your body can heal.  Not exactly the answers I was looking for.    I have the second round of interviews in coos bay on the 3rd.  I've been spending time every day sending energy to the interview.  I very much want to live on the coast and get away from all the competition.  I don't want to leave my friends, and I know that many of us will continue to keep in touch either by writing or messageing... Adn some people you were only meant to touch for a moment and then each of you goes on.  One step at a time though.  I ahve to get through the interveiw first them I'll worry about where I'm going to live and how much I'll miss my friends.   For now though, its only 1230 but the percoset is kicking in and I can't keep my eyes open.  My pain level is down to about a 2 and I need to take advantage of that and go crawl into bed.  I really need to do something for Bobbi we has been such a good friend.  trill
I finally decided to get a blog. I'll be organizing my thoughts and thinking about things that I might put in my BOS.
Had to go back into the hospital for a few days.  Actually had to call and get an ambulance this time. (Sorry Gail didn't mean to throw up on your ear.) They scoped me and found several ulcers in my stomach and intestines.  Also decided that the pain in my lower abdomin was being caused by a pinched nerve.  So I'm trying some medication the targets those nerves.  So far it seems to be working really well.    Except :( my picc line is infected.  Its a scary infection because the picc line goes up throught the artery to the heart.  I'm taking antibiotics and using wet heat to try and break up any clots and reduce the swelling.  I can't make my arm straight because of the swelling.  Its like a muscle cramp right in the elbow.   Sigh... I'm tired of being sick.  And I'm tired of being tired.  I went to the dr, the bank and the pharmacy today and came home exhausted.  I had to sit in the car for 20 minutes at the pharmacy before I could even drive home. So I'm going to go take a nap and put heat on my arm again.  Took a quiz off of Kurts blog... thought it was kind of interesting.    You are a Spiritualist.

You are a good judge of character but your idealism or morality can confuse others.    urlLink   Which Magical Order Are You In?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
