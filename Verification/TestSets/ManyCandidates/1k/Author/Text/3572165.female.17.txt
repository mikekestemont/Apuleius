last night in scotland!! it's after 10 now, kinda late, but we are still going :-). today we just hung out, packed, cleaned...then after dinner we came to the church and played American football and ultimate frisbee with the mission team (or what's left of it...phil, debbie, jason and tricia left this morning).  inverness was wonderful...so nice, and lovely :-P i enjoyed it very much. although i must say i am perfectly ready to go home. scotland is nice, very nice, but i miss my family :-/ and i need a hug :-P. plus i have a ton to tell them, i'm about to BURST with all of it!!! 6:20 pm Eastern Time is too long to wait.
well, we are now in inverness. We took the bus up from Glasgow at 11:15 and arrived here at 3:30. we are staying in a hostel, which is kinda like a dorm - there are lots of rooms with bunkbeds, and you share them with other people. it is a lot nicer than i thought it would be, but then, i haven't seen the other 3 girls who are in our room :-P.  friday went...alright. there was trouble with the bank not transfering the money for the loan, so the Quigley's couldn't move in until today. Thankfully, the owners of their new home still let  us move stuff in on friday, so that all there is to do today is move mattresses, clothes, and other things that they needed over the weekend.  on saturday we went up to Stirling. once again, it was rainy and cold, but we still got to visit the Castle and the Wallace Monument. we went to the top of the monument, but i only stayed there for - half a minute, because it was sooo windy it felt like i would be blown off! the mission team had a free day, so Joe (from Broomall RPC) came to Stirling with us. Then we met the rest of the mission team, Rob and Jess Edgar and Rob's parents at the Caledonian Brewrey in Edinburgh for a Caley. A Caley is Scottish dancing. It was sooo much fun! i have never had more fun dancing than i did then. i didnt know any of the dances, and neither did anyone else that i was with, but we went through them quickly before picking up the speed, and it was really really neat. ten times better than dancing at prom :-P there was one dance where there is 2 couples, and they are in a circle guy-girl-guy-girl, and the guys lift the girls up and spin them around!! :-P it's called the basket. it was very very fun. too bad we don't have Caley's in Pittsburgh.  well, we are about to head out to Loch Ness to search for the monster :-P. Christie figures now is about the time for it to appear, and that she will be the one to spot it.
well yesterday was rainy and dreary in Glasgow :-( we went shopping mostly, there isn't any castle there or anything to visit. when we came back we went to Mr. Kebab's with Karen for dinner. We were going to go to the Robertson's for MET, which would have been lots of fun, but Angie Robertson wasn't feeling very well,so it was cancelled. During dinner, Tricia and Ryan came to get us to practice some psalms. Andrew wants the mission team and us to sing some psalms for the congregation after evening service, b/c the psalter is different here. they are trying to move to ours, but they don't know them well at all so we are going to help them learn them :-). of course, we are singing 98A.  Their   psalter is a split-leaf (i think that's what it's called) with the music at the top, and then words on the bottom. actually, most of the psalters don't even have the music, so we have been winging it pretty much, trying to pick up the tune after the first verse.  today the Quigley's are moving. The mission team + people from the church are helping move, while Alicia, Bekah, Christie and Corinne watch the 3 youngest Quigley's, Calvin, Catherine and Caitlin. I am being sent to paint in the new house!! :-) it should be fun, at first it sounded like i would be the only one painting, but Jason (team leader) said that some of them would probably help.  tonight the mission team is having an ice cream social/bas ball game for the youth, that should be a lot of fun. well, i should go get to work now :-) oh, i'm terribly sorry, but the computer i'm on at the library won't let me onto my blog, it will only let me post stuff. soo that means i haven't been able to read any of your comments!! *sniff* lol you see, i'm assuming that some of you will have commmented. :-P well, i'll have lots to read when i get home, right?!!
not a lot of time...but the Covenanter Tour was GREAT!!! i really enjoyed it,even though we didn't get to go to Wigton to see where the 2 margaret's died...oh well, i guess i'll just have to come back sometime :-)i gtg, we are going to Glasgow today to shop, sightsee, etc.
whew! i have had an exhausting couple of days :-) on saturday karen took us into Edinburgh and, although it was wet and cold, we saw the castle, and shopped down the Royal Mile. it was very neat. on lord's day, after church the Robertson's, a family at ARPC had us, the mission team, and others from the church over all afternoon. we were fed twice, and other than that sat around and talked :-). Lord's Day evening, Pastor Blair from the Galway Mission work in Ireland came and did a presentation on their fellowship there. it was very interesting, as i had not heard much about it before then. after church, Andrew began our Covenanter Tour with an hour long lecture on the 2 reformations i
