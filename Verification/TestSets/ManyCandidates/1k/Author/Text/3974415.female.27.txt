I feel like I have been blessed beyond measure with the opportunity to re-live the 70s and witness the rhetoric surrounding the Vietnam saga. "I'm John Kerry, and I'm reporting for duty..." Oh, by the way, I served in Vietnam and have 3 purple hearts. Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam..... tax cuts! Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam.... strong national defense! Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam.... health care!  So.... besides stuff about Vietnam, what did you do in the Senate for the last 20 years? Oh, that's right... how could we forget? You voted on the balanced budget and worked on increasing the police force. So hopefully you know how a bill becomes a law by now... good, good, good....  You know Hillary and Bill... that's reassuring. And John Edwards is cute. Good choice. Can we do something about his wife? Can he have an affair or something? She's kind of too normal -- it's probably baby fat, but still.... And speaking of -- why the generational divide between their children? Did they forget how babies are made? Did they not like how the first one turned out? She seems nice enough. Did they  need some kids for the camera ? Poor woman. Now I feel for her. She's a baby-makin' machine for her husband's political aspirations. That's gotta suck. "What do you do?" "Oh, I wait for my husband to decide what he's going to do next, and then pop out a kid."  That's family values.  I'll tell you what family values is!! Family values is ridin' down the subway wich yo mama in yo bling bling.... catchin' yo ride to yo crib sayin while yo chillin'... "Yo, mama, where we be?" And havin' yo mama speak truth sayin', "Shut cho mouth, boy, where we goin'? To get me some mo bling bling up in heya."  Amen.  Hallelujah!  Praise Jesus and Reverend Al Sharpton!  And while we're at it, Jesse Jackson!  And MLK!  Go Democrats!  Vietnam, Civil Rights, and Unions.... That's some original material right there!
Last night I had some of the worst dreams I've had in awhile.  I think it was because we watched "Amish in the City" and "Shark Week" back to back.   Consequently, I was at beaches I had never been to before and was watching people in shallow water being eaten by great whites.  It was horrible.  My stomach is still off this morning because of it.
Today....    Today was a department meeting from hell.  From 1:00 to 4:00 we discussed the annual report for the department.  Great fun, let me tell you.      On a more interesting note, I found a musician I think I really like -- Mindy Smith.  She sounds somewhat like Alison Krauss, but more bluezy.  "Come to Jesus" is really good.    I missed yoga today, and that's frustrating, but I did have quality time with Reagan, and I'm making hamburger pizza for dinner.  MMMMMMMMMM - YUMMMMMMM    I've had a lot of weird thoughts throughout the day, but probably the most worthy is a new paper idea I'm working out in my head.  Jeff Weaver asked about Mayhew's notion of hiring leaders to take care of collective good problems in Congress due to all Members seeking personal reelection rather than institutional maintenance.  I answered that it made sense that those "hired" like Dennis Hastert were probably less marginal than other Members and thus in a better position to fulfill the task.  But I don't know that this has been tested.  So maybe I'll do just that.
Sorry that everything I write is about my dream life, but it's really been active lately.    So last night I was in my grandmother's old house in Fort Walton Beach, and nobody was home except the little kid from the Sixth Sense and me.  The kid would wake up each morning and make stewed tomatoes... dump a can into a saucepan and heat it up till it was really boiling over, and then eat it.  All I remember is that this kid was really interested in finding out about me.  He asked me sincere questions.  I was supposed to go to this dance, and so I had asked a friend to take me, and the kid kept asking me whether I was excited about going, about getting dressed up, and about going with this friend.  I was none of the above, and rather felt it was an obligation for me to go.  The other thing that stood out in the dream that I remember is that the friend, though in the dream he was from highschool or college or something, was actually Jeremy White - one of my Jeremy's friends from Oklahoma.  I told the kid that I didn't trust him, that he was not a decent guy and had bad habits.  I was not looking forward to spending my time with him... and the kid didn't understand why I would have chosen to go with him.    The other dream I had involved my trip to Chicago.  I had left Pensacola and was in Charlotte catching a connection.  The stewardess and pilot were fighting with each other, so I decided to go to the bathroom and freshen up.  When I walked in there was an elderly man in the doorway, and when he saw me he looked at the sign and realized he was in the wrong restroom, and as he left I heard him say "I don't even care any more."  The sinks in the bathroom were full of poop - all of them except one.  I used that one to wet down my hair, and when I dried it in the hand drier it was perfectly straight and beautiful.  In the process of fixing my makeup with a broken applicator, my hand brushed a sink and got poop on it.  I freaked out and washed my hands really hard, and then left.  I realized I was late to catch the plane and began to run down the terminal.  At the gate I realized I hadn't checked in, and that my ticket actually was for the following week.  I was a week early and s
