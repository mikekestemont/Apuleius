I have to be more regular in posting my diary. But anyway,  its GROSS time.  1)Doctors pull worms from woman's eye Two worms measuring 12cm were removed from an eye of a 64-year-old Indian woman by doctors in the southern Indian state of Kerala, the Press Trust of India reported.   The woman, identified only as Amina, had been admitted to hospital complaining of pain and irritation in her eyes.   K S Chandrakanth, a doctor who supervised the operation, said he had seen "something moving" in Amina's right eyeball soon after she came into the hospital.   "The filarial worms had made their way to the lymphatic vessels and were about to migrate to other parts of her body," he said.   "Had the worms gone deeper, she would have probably lost her eyesight," Chandrakanth said, adding that Amina had been discharged from hospital.   He speculated that the worms' larvae might have entered Amina's bloodstream through mosquitoes and had reached the eye through the blood vessels in the fully grown state.   AFP   Yucks!  2) Sex in the toilet? I was cleaning my foodcourt just after it closed for the day and there was this Asian guy who sat down on the platform powdering his face with a mascara.. No joke! That's the not gross thing. He even sang loudly, obviously very happy... Feeling curious, I asked him what set him up.  "I just had sex in the toilet. Sex in the toilet!"  I remember another Asian boy coming out from the corridor where the toilet is located asking me where the nearest exit to get to the train station. I wonder if he was the one...  That guy who powdered his face continued singing something about "if I am not alone" something like that... His accent sounded Philipino...  Yeah, have plenty of sex, guys. Thanks a lot! Because after that raunchous acts of you guys, I got to clean the toilet up! Besides the toilet is so dirty and stinky, I am so surprised that you guys can still have sex in there!!!  Gross.  3) That muscle guy (let's call him Jack) is not that gross but creepy. Something about that piercing smile of Jack both errie and exciting at the same time. We have managed to meet today for lunch at one of the MacDonald's outlet near my workplace. We talked and Yes, he is earning lots of money...  "If I haven't got my Masters and got into IT eariler, I would have retired rich now at age 40. I could have done my PhD as well but no $$."  Sounds like a money grabber. When I asked him about his future plans, suddenly his usual low volume went up a notch... way up with determination and a sudden aggression.  "A mansion by the beach with my feet dugged nicely in the sand, enjoying the view and reading a book..."  "Alone?" I asked  "Yes."  Wow. But he was going to the swimming pool to exhibit his muscles (and of course implying that he is going to have sex in the toilets there...)  The topic suddenly swung about me and he took the utmost opportunity to disect my life in that half-hour. I told him I am sick of IT and hope to get into finance.   "You need to look into your life again. You seem wanting to avoid stress like a plauge. If you get into Finance, you have to associate with stress. You know in ten years time I would call you a loser if you are still stuck in that cleaning job of yours."  Is that the brutual honesty or just plain cynical? But that really hit a sore spot in my heart as though somebody has splashed acid on me. Suddenly I felt I was in denial about a lot of things, assuming a different persona in order to portray myself in a different way that I want to. But deep down inside was a sad person wanting to get ahead in society, unfortunately getting bumps in the way.   I felt sick... Gross about myself.  So I said to him,  "Thank you for disecting my life and reducing me into the terms you have made."  He seemed glad that he has offered "help"... started talking about other jobs like counselling, social worker and other stuff...   Despite all that, we exchanged numbers. My gut feeling is that I probably won't get to see or hear from him in the future since he wants to be "in control" - means calling me if he wants to meet me.  Oh well! I better give that one up even though he has nice muscles... But with that kind of attitude, I rather be with old fat granddaddies whose attitude are way much better than his.  I am gross aint I?
The weather in Sydney is getting colder and shorter by the day. And there is a flu going around with almost everyone including me, wheezing and leeking beak... Must be the cold weather.  There are so many facets of "cold"...  Let me highlight some personal feelings about the news today.  Super cold-blooded! Nobody loves the scums of the earth, especially the so-called Islamic militants. News about a captured American contract civilian, Nick Berg, who was beheaded by a bunch of islamic thugs, videotaped and put on their website. CBS News probably broke the first news, but not excluding a bunch of sick news like that Iraqi prisoner abuse. Unfortunate as it was, the same bunch of pictures of those abuse are still being shown around the world million of times. So many times that I am beginning to find it funny. The news programs should do an uncensored and let the world how insignificant the Iraqis' dicks are!  CBS Evening News stunned the world by showing the screaming sounds where Nick Berg drew out his last breath before the thugs kicked him down and the image stalled where Nick was finally beheaded. The rest of the news programs tried NOT to show that part but it is just too disgusting... I am cleaning in t
