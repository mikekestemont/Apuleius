Notes of our return trip.  (O is 15.5 months, K is 2 months and C is nearly 13)  Somewhere over Saskatchewan I began laughing hysterically.  It was also about that time that we put O's very LAST clean, dry outfit on her and I realized that somehow we were on the last size 3 diaper in our carry-ons.  While we were so unobtrusively jetting across the prairies, both our girls were busy pooping and peeing their way through every diaper and outfit I had packed.  But I jump ahead.  Let me start at the beginning of the day's journey.  The drive to Toronto was relatively quiet and uneventful, (once I stopped crying from the sad departure at L's) leading me to continued hope that we might make the return journey as comparatively easily as the flight over.  We made good time, got the van returned and all our stuff into the airport by the two o'clock mark we'd set.  After a quick bathroom break and diaper changes for the girls, we got in line to check in our bags only to discover that the flight was basically sold out and there weren't any seats available to be blocked off for us.  Frustration and apprehension began to set in.  I had blocked the possibility of 5 hours with babies on our laps out of my mind, praying that there would be a few seats and that we would be so pitiable that we'd get them.  OH WELL.  That's why the babies get on free, right?  Because it's so traumatic for the parents that the airlines don't charge for the little monsters.  We check our bags and began walking around, looking for a spot to have some lunch and kill some time.  K is sleeping happily, O is being charming and cooperative.  We all manage to eat (though predictably, K wakes up and fusses for the duration of the meal, falling fast asleep again as soon as my plate is cleared away).  O needed a change after lunch due to food and drink spilled, but she DID learn how to drink from a straw while we were there!!!   We'd eaten near the kids' play place with slides and climbing stuff, so C went off to the bookstore and we chased O around and had her going up and down the slides and steps to try to wear her out.  She was thoroughly enjoying herself.  She played hard for well over a half an hour.  K continued to sleep peacefully, but around this point Kevin and I began to wonder if this was really such a good thing.  O soaked a pair of her shorts and had to have another change, but I wasn't too worried.  I'd packed FIVE changes of clothes for her and three for K, plus at least about 15 diapers between them.  O was beginning to show signs of impending tiredness, a good thing (one would think) as we were only about 45 minutes away from departure time.  K had woken up and eaten, also a good thing since (in theory) she would be ready to go back to sleep by the time we got on the plane.  It was around then that I acknowledged  we were soon going to have to surrender not only the stroller but K's car seat as well when we boarded the plane.   As I watched O rubbing her eyes and clinging to my knees and K starting to squirm and fuss, a sense of dread began to creep over me.  Minutes away from pre-boarding (which we OVER qualify for!) an attendant came over to us and made sure our stroller and car seat were tagged and ready to go.  We asked if they had a plastic bag we could put one of the babies in to stow under the plane as well, of course we would poke holes in it for air!  Ha ha.  Lame attempt at humour, sadly I was thinking it might not be such a bad idea.  I think it was just after this that I noticed O's diaper seemed rather squishy (again) and K started power pooping.  Ok, I was Ok.  I can change a diaper in the blink of an eye now, with the diaperee sitting, standing or laying down.  Plus, I had Kevin to help.  K chose this particular moment to turn her head and spit up most of her last meal all over the front of my shirt and down into my pocket.  Good thing I packed a change of shirt for myself.  Too bad I thought I wouldn't need it and packed it at the very bottom of my carry on.  He took O, and I took K.  Only to discover that the washrooms by the boarding gates do not have change tables!!!  Imagine!  So there I was, changing a very poopy K on a stainless steel baggage checking counter in front of about 120 folks waiting to board a long flight (with us) to Vancouver.   (At this point I still cared about what people might be thinking.  Fortunately for her, K didn't.)  And this particular change involved an entire change of clothes too, poop was halfway up her back.  I tried not to get any in her hair as I took her dirty outfit off, at the same time I hear them calling for all passengers needing assistance to begin boarding.  Uh, I am thinking that is US.  WE need assistance, no doubt about it.  Help.  Somehow we find ourselves standing at the gate ready to board, babies in our arms since neither wants to be in the stroller anymore, and we are asked to produce ID for everyone (how could we be so stupid to forget we might need to be holding that TOO) so Kevin digs around for it and then we are down the ramp and collapsing the stroller and surrendering the carseat and C and I get shuttled onto the plane while Kevin is dealing with the stroller and O.   As he collapses the stroller, a cup of juice that w
