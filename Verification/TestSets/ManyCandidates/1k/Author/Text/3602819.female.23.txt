Here I am found but completely lost. Those who know me know that I have a tendency to act like I have everything figured out all the while I am trying to figure things out. Before I had a boyfriend I thought to myself....why don't I have a boyfriend I know how to love afterall I have the greatest teacher of love in my life--Jesus. I would think to myself that I would be the best girlfriend. But then I get a boyfriend and I feel like an infant stumbling to walk. Many bruises, many scrapes. I am left with the discovery that this is one area that I just don't know crap about. I guess you don't really discover how totally selfish you can be unitl you are knee deep in trying to love someone and be loved by them. I just wish there was a button to push that would automatically assert God's ability to love unselfishly onto me. So what is something that you thought you had figured out but realized you didn't. Any thoughts on love?
Love? So many people talk about it today... I love my shoes. I love my dogs. I love that song. I love my dad and mom. I love my boyfriend (of 2 days... Not really me... More so everyone in high school and under). So what does it mean? I was pondering this (among many things) today. We are a culture that is bloated with love... Retaining all of the "love" we have, but we never have any place to get rid of it, because we don't know how, so we just remain bloated. In the Greek language, there are 3 words for love... THREE! We only have one. We have to emphasize what love really is... "No man, I   LOVE   you..." Okay... That's all for today. Just pondering on the vast greatness of God, wondering how He can LOVE us so much, while we don't even understand what true love really is... Questions? Comments? Good jokes? Bring it on... LOVE!!!!

So in my last post, there were so many things going in on in my head, at such a late hour, I don't know what I'm suppose to think now. As I was in church this morning, there was this overwhelming feeling that came over me, actually, two. The first would be the sermon, which was on fathers, and our Eternal Father... How He is perfect. It made me reflect on the kind of man my dad is... One of a kind. He truly is one of the greatest men to walk this earth, and I think that may be why I'm still single. When you have a dad that is as awesome as mine is, it's hard to settle for anything less that... Loving, kind, compassionate, generous... He really is the best dad in the whole world.  The other feeling that came over me was the love and acceptance I have with my church family. As much as I miss my Dadoo and Mom-o and brothers... Not to mention the rest of my family, the feelings I had about not staying in this area for much longer, slowly dwindled away into the abyss. It also had to do with "my kids" at the church. They are all so lovable, and I don't know what I would do if I didn't have those kids to teach, love on and spend time with. To anyone who reads this, and doesn't work with kids... Start now! They will teach you so much about unconditional love and acceptance, not to mention how to be honest and laugh at yourself (yes Sam, I'm talking about you beautiful!). So there is my speel tonight. I hope all are doing well. May the Lord bless you and keep you in His love for eternity, I'm out...
Okay, so these thoughts are not all too deep... At least not at the moment. It's late, I have laundry to fold, and I'm on here flogging because I'm addicted to the stupid computer. (wow... Where did that come from?) today I took one of my students to see the new Harry potter movie... I highly suggest those who have not seen it, should! It's a fun, fantasy movie that young and old can enjoy... Together even! Then, after the wonderful movie, I went to our church picnic (what was Rising Sun Christian Church is now Rockingham Christian Church). Words cannot express how blessed I am to have a church family like Rockingham. The people are so friendly, loving and fun to be around. There are times when I really don't know what I'm doing here in New England. I love this area, and I love my church family, but at times... I don't know if this is where God has me for the rest of my life. I wish that would be the case, but I have to be honest with myself. I think God will be changing my plans sooner than I think.... Maybe not for another year or so, but I don't know. I just get that feeling that God is working in ways I cannot imagine, and that is going to lead me down a road less traveled. although I love it here in new England, and would prefer to stay here for the rest of my life... God has been working. I can't explain what I really mean by thing, but it's something I know. The only unusual thing about it, is that when I've felt this before, I knew where God was taking me... That was New England! I don't know... Maybe I'm just getting antsy because I don't know what God has in store for me after school... My hope and prayer would be to work in Boston in a medical office where I can make the biggest impact. Boston is a city I love, and a place I can see myself in for a long time to come. But one of life's greatest questions for a Christian has always been "okay Lord... What a
