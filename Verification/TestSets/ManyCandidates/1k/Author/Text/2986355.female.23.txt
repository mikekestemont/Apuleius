Obviously I'm very very bored today, as this is like my sixteenth post.  But I just love it when people use sayings they've heard a lot without thinking about what they mean and get them wrong.  Like this fine gentleman:  L, I changed my Cell #....... - m4w   I know it's been over two years, but I'm sure you realize you would like to talk again. However, I changed my cell so e-mail me and we can rap once again !  I think I finally soaked my last wild oat !
I may be going to hell, but I'm sorry, this just makes me laugh.  Oh how I adore  urlLink Craigslist .  Can I get a Hallelujah?  the young, the hip, the devout - 27   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Reply to: anon-27773333@craigslist.org Date: 2004-03-31, 3:20PM EST  Anyone who thinks that christianity isn't hip should visit their local tattoo parlor...notice any icons?, and these are the old school tats, Religion has always been hip, people. We can love the lord, shoot some stick, drink some whiskey, go to art shows, blah, blah, blah. Besides try having a conversation with some one who knows religion, it's doubtful you'll ever be more engaged. (years of debating things beyond our knowledge will do that to a person)  Can I get a Hallejuah!   it's NOT ok to contact this poster with services or other commercial interests this is in or around this city
Via  urlLink Productshop :  "Jackie Farry has worked with and been friends with every great band from Nirvana to The Yeah Yeah Yeahs. While she was The Datsuns tour manager, she was diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma, a rare form of cancer, and has been to sick to work and is facing nasty financial problems. But as she says, "Fuck Cancer!" So here's the deal. There are two ways to help Jackie out. The first is to go to her  urlLink Fuck Cancer Benifit Concert  on May 11th at the Bowery Ballroom that will feature Cat Power, Har Har Superstar, Miss Pussycat, and a bunch of other bands. The second, and what I recommend you should do, is enter the  urlLink Fuck Cancer Raffle . This is one of the coolest fucking raffles I've ever seen. For just $12 you can have a chance at winning Nick Zinner of The Yeah Yeah Yeah's guitar / Le Tigre Tote bag / Iggy Pop signed poster / tickets to Coachella / Guitar Lessons from Stephan Malkmus / Drum lessons from Russel Simins (JSBX) / Free Day of Recording for your band with Nicolas Vernhes (Fiery Furnaces, Fischerspooner, etc) / and tons of other amazing prises. Enter the contest, get karma, win cool shit, and fuck cancer............"
As someone who's worked with just about every kind of dog and every kind of owner, I had already unscientifically determined that  urlLink people tend to get dogs that resemble themselves in both looks and personality .  One of my best friends in high school was from a family of very very thin people, and, of course, they had a  urlLink whippet .  And then there are the portly folks with the bulldogs and the yappy little Upper East Side girls with their yappy little  urlLink dogs-in-a-bag .  I love most dogs, but I really want one of  urlLink these .  Sadly, I fear getting one would require an apartment that is greater than 144 square feet and at least one of the following: free time, excess income, husband.  Yeah, not gonna happen any time soon.
Ooooh my god, remember the game of  urlLink MASH , that you played in the back of 7th grade math class until you got yelled at so you flipped off the teacher and got taken to the principal's office but you lagged behind and ran away to the playground instead and then you almost got expelled but because Christians are forgiving you just had to miss the class trip to the waterpark and spend the day with the militant lesbian gym teacher?  I sure don't, but I hear it was a popular game.  [via  urlLink ultragrrrl  via  urlLink megadork ]
I think it's a safe bet that if you're reading this you're on Friendster, and that you've had  urlLink this conversation  more than once [via  urlLink Morning News ].  On the one hand, I think it would be kind of refreshing to stop relying on the internet to facilitate socialization and communication.  On the other hand, I'd probably be too lazy/chicken to actually call people and would have no friends.
According to  urlLink this article , casting is underway in Britain for 300 people to be naked extras in the new Johnny Depp "period piece packed with sexual material."  Wonder if Johnny will be naked as well.  Either way, I think it's time to move to the Isle of Man, girls.
I always thought it was the blonde-haired, brown-eyed, round-faced, deep-voiced thing that was responsible for the 593 Julia Stiles comparisons I've gotten since she descended upon  urlLink teen celebrity land  a couple years ago.  But I think our shared ability to look sad/pissed off/aloof when not any of those things (okay, maybe aloof...) is what makes us true doppelgangers.  Hooray for no facial expression induced wrinkles!  From  urlLink midwestgrrl :  Would Someone Give Julia Stiles A Job A job that isn't acting, which she can't do anyway. Last time I checked, facial expressions were required in most acting jobs, even shitty ones, and her deadface isn't cutting it. I suppose now that movies like The Prince and Me are beginning to make it through her selection process, the inevitable downward spiral has begun in earnest. Look at it this way, Julia: You'll never need Botox!
From  urlLink Page Six :  March 26, 2004 -- ANOTHER night, another carnal conquest for Mick Jagger (above). The 60-year-old Rolling Stone took a 20-year-old Columbia University co-ed named Meredith back to his suite at the Mandarin Oriental after partying with her at Lotus and Bungalow 8 the other night. Jagger met the brunette beauty at Lotus, but left with some pals and ended up at the more e
