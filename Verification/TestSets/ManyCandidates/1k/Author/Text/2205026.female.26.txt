Happy Halloween!  Question for Blogger veterans; see down there, at the bottom of my blog? There's a set of links to the Webrings I'm on, and they will NOT all line up on one line. I can't figure out why... Any hints? Also I seem to be having a problem with my Archives.... Hmmm. To the support section! :cue batman music:  I like this blogger thing, I think.   Moving offices is going well; my new cube is about twice as big as my old one, so that's pretty cool. And if I stand up (half sized cube walls) I can see out the window and the Pacific Ocean. Yes, living in  southern California does have a few advantages. Though, with all this fire, not that many.  Yes I'm near the fire. Yes, I know people who have lost their homes, though, thank god, none that have lost their lives. It's been smoky and ashy and awful here for a while... But it seems to be a bit better now. Colder, wetter. The fires are 30-60% contained. Now what we need is a nice earthquake... :P  School is long. I'm working, and going to school, AND attempting  urlLink NaNoWriMo  again this year. You can follow my  urlLink NaNo Blog , if you're so inclined. (I know, nobody will. :D)  No knitting/fiber news, other than the fact that I like my short row ears. I want to include a progress bar in this blog, but it will have to wait for tomorrow...
Good morning!  No pictures, yet, but I am trying to post more often.  Yey! Halloween is almost here! ::wriggles with joy:: I love Halloween!  So, I went to a urlLink  Silent Weekend  last weekend. ???, you ask? Silent weekend is a kind of immerse American Sign language camp. From Friday to Sunday, you do not talk. At all. Only signing. In your cabins, at meals, everything. It's fantastic. I always learn so much.  So anyway, I get up there, (having grabbed a few balls of wool and my knitting needles - never leave home without it, eh?) and realized I had no costume. I had exactly 1 day to come up with it, and I was 50 miles from a store, with no car, and couldn't talk.  What to do?  You guessed it. I whipped out the odd 'spice' colored yarn I had brought (kinda dull peach) to do a  urlLink Tangle  on Saturday night, and cast on ten stitches.  My goal? Somehow knit myself ears. Mouse ears....  So I knit along, increasing as I go, till I've got a bit of a crescent in my hand. I think to myself, 'gee, I wish I knew how to do short rows; this would be perfect for that! Oh well...'  Then I smack myself. Why not? I mean, I know the  theory  behind short rows. Even read the knitty.com article about wrapping stitches... why couldn't I?  So I tried it. And by gum, it worked! So I sat up Friday night, matching the one little cupped ear I had made, and then did a simple twisted cord (basically making a HUGE strand of yarn) for the tail. A black eyeliner penciled nose, and i was ready.   Ok, two more bits about this story. One: Everybody else had these great, elaborate costumes. One girl had made hers herself; a picture perfect Dorothy costume, complete with glittered shoes. Sewed the whole thing... And i was in grey pants, a grey shirt, and pink ears and tail...  The other thing is that there were these two Deaf kids there. I love kids. I love signing. I love signing to Deaf kids. See? So I had been teaching the girl to knit (she was fascinated by me knitting the ears), and playing with them both. I knit them little Kitty Nosewarmers. They used them for hats. I told them a story in ASL. We had fun....  Ok, so we're all standing up, waiting to be judged on the contest. I don't even want to be up there, as my 'costume' is pretty lame compared to the others... and out come the judges.  yup, the kids.  So they look us over, and I try to be 'rat-like' (in ASL, body language is very important) and the kids laugh at me. Good thing...  I won. I didn't mean to cheat! I didn't KNOW the kids would be the judges... Anyway, I won a free silent weekend... and all because I decided to try wrapped short rows!  Knitting: is there anything it can't do?  mouse

Testing...
Good morning!  Happy Thanksgiving, for those of you who partake. We had a nice time.  One of the highlights of the day was that Saint Cheryl taught me how to 'knit back', or knit without turning. What a cowinkidink, I was just reading about in some other blog about somebody catching on how to do that.  Well, actually, I learned how to purl back, because I was garter stitching (is that grammatically correct?), but whatever. Not easy at first, but even so, it was nicer than turning that long strap (for the backpack) and knitting across the back. And it was challenging, so it made me more interested in the boring strap knitting process.  And I can finally announce that the straps for the back pack are done! YEA! ::insert muppet dance here::  Now, I can't say the backpack is done, and here's why.  originally, I get the pattern and say 'Oooooo.... I wanna make that right away!'. But, of course, I couldn't just *make* the thing, that would be too easy... So I decide to make my own color pattern. Little tiny stripes instead of the big ones in the pattern. No problem.   Knit, knit, knit.  About 3
