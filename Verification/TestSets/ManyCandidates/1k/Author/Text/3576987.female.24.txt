Well I managed to figure some shit out with this blog.  Another day of waiting for people to send me shit so I can finish processing my loans.  But now I am off to the music store for 9.5 hours.  So must take care of shit from there.  In my spare time tomorrow, ha ha, I will need to come in the office for the rest of the shit I need for this other loan.  Tonight I must work out, failed last night.  Luckily I didn't over eat yesterday since I did not manage to workout, but did however manage to drink quite a bit of wine.  Is it Friday yet???
I will be mass emailing this but just in case, my new cell # is 614-316-1376.
Well I got an update from Burton on the black out period I had Saturday night.  I don't remember anything after we started to leave comfest.  The last thing I remember is Dan grabbing my cooler for me.  Burt said by the time we got back to the car I dropped down on the grass between my cousins drive way and the street, and apparently was on the phone.  This must be when I was talking to Helen.  Burt had to help me change my clothes, really like put my pants on and get the skirt off.  He said he even had to zip and button up the shit.  That is a bit embarassing, yet funny.  I hope my cousin didn't see me, I would hate to have embarassed him in front of his house.  So on the way to the bar I peed in someones yard, Burt said Robert helped block the view.  Thanks Robert.  Burt said some guy picked me up at the bar and we were doing some crazy dance shit (like literally picked me up.)  I don't remember any of this.  Very sad.  The next thing I remember after leaving comfest was being in the bar thinking I can believe I am standing here dancing right now, and soon after sat down.  I had several men hitting on me, don't know why, can't immagine I looked too good sitting there wanting to throw-up.  This happens to me everytime I go to that place, not as gay a bar as it should be.  Some dude was trying to tell me he wasn't gay (I always enjoy this) but his gay boss was there and he had to make him think he was gay, What?? I asked him to get me water as I couldn't stand, he didn't come through.  So Gerardo (I think that was his name) got me water.  Then I had to get out of there, too much smoke.  Of course you can't leave the bar with water, heaven forbid it is vodka.  So I had to sit thirsty as hell on the curb thing in front of Axis until I was able to stand and walk down to Betty's.  Wasn't too smart of me not to have drank much water all day sat.  I think the severe dehydration did not help my drunken situation.   As for the rest of the day it was great, I saw tons of friends, had a great time.  Was happily shit faced the whole day, until later when I felt sick.  Of course I worked my way through that, and did not get sick.  I am still unable to drink liquor after our last cook-out, but luckily I did not ruin my wine drinking experience Saturday by getting sick.  I don' think I'll be getting drunk for a while however.  But here comes 4th of July weekend.  I could give a shit about it really, only another reason for people to drink, and usually have the day off.  So it is Sunday this year, does me very little good.  I won't have to teach Monday night, but the first week of the month is when we get paid by the students, so I'll have to wait a week for the monday students $$. I am not sure yet if the banks will be open Monday, which could potentially be a pain in the ass.  In the mortgage bus. banks being closed is not beneficial.  Not sure if I have to work at the other job.    In Italy they get 2 days off for their independence day, which is more of a celebration of when Italy unified.  If we are going to have a day off, 2 would be better.  It only took Girabaldi and 1000 men to unify Italy.  We managed to wipe out a good portion of the native population and have a war on our road to "freedom".    Ok time for a bowl then bed.
So it looks like I will be getting a new cell phone since the assholes want a payment in full, tried to tell me I haven't paid in 90 days, which isn't correct.  Fuck AT&T Wireless.  Or half a payment maybe they will re-activate.  Fuck it.  So new phone will be on the way soon, new number. No more roaming bullshit, there is definitely no roaming charges on the new plan.  This has been a long ass week at work, too many hours.  But I did have a relaxing weekend last weekend, enjoyed the weather.  Hope to have a good weekend this weekend.  Lots of people to see.  So I am ready for the first full week of July when I get paid by all 3 jobs, should be a good week that week.  Barrister still owes me money, don't know if I'll get that.  Don't know who is in charge now, apparently Lisa and Rich are possibly splitting up, so Steve, another bartender, is in charge of scheduling, I don't know about pay, and I don't know why he is in charge.  Lisa was better than him.  Still I liked it better with Rich in charge.  Whatever.  I need to find another bar job.    Anyone going to see Rufus Wainwright next month??? I need to get tickets.   If anyone is interested my cousin Teresa is having a p
