*tear*, I want to go out side and never come back in.... it is suuuuch a lovely night out there... but I don't want to be alone... well I could go knock on my neighbors door and see if his cousin is there...lol hehe maybe not  well im gonna go ~jo
No one has posted in a really long time!!! I feel it is my sworn duty to do something about this, but I'm not sure what to do!! So for now I'll just make another random post!  I just found out today that I have freckles!!! That is the most terrifying thing ever!!! I've never had freckles before!!! I'm going to go screaming into the night now, so please post, so that I don't have to babble on like this again!!!!   Au Revoir
Wow, I just remembered what my nightmare was about!! Someone let Dianna from school post on our blog!! I don't know what my sub-concious was thinking to make me have a dream like that, but it was terrifying!! And all she posted about was how cool she was and how obsessed with Nate Bjur she was!!! Wow, I'm scarying myself all over again!!!! Ahhhhhhhhhhh........   Au Revoir
I finally talked to Katie!!! Wow, it's really hard being separated from my twin for such a long time!! It's going to be dreadful when we got off to college!! Oh well, what is really sad is that all she talked about was Nicholas! She's more obsessed than we ever thought!!! Ooooo, and Abby's coming soooooon!!!!   Au Revoir
Hola, no mucho aqui, yo muy aburrido.  ok done with espanol... I am sooo bored... any idea of what I could do to occupy my self? ~jo
I think it's broken, though. So sad.  I remember the day I got it. 5/7 of my family was on vacation and we were staying in a hotel in this little hickish town called Mariposa. My parents and sister went for a walk around town and looked at the little shops and when they came back they brought many treasures back with them - one being my preciousss and another being the location of a store that sold Drumsticks. Yum. Oh, right. Getting off topic... my parents had wanted to buy me this ring cause of the Relient K song. I had put it on one of the many tapes I had made for the trip and they loved it. So, when they saw the mood ring sitting on the shop counter, they thought of me. How grand is that? When they saw a symbol of moodiness, they thought of me =P   I forget my point for sharing this delightful tale but hey, it's summer and it's not like I've got anything better to do that share pointless stories. Thank you and good day.
Wow, I just had a grand time at youth group! Well not my youth group, but yeah, it was quite entertaining! Oh and Laura I decided to wear my cool new polo from Nordstrom, it's blue and pretty! So yeah, ummm that tis all for now! Go sticky rice!!   Au Revoir
Its seems odd that the smplest thing in the world could be the most tasty. Sticky rice is like my all time favorite food. (that and lemon grass soup!)  I had it on monday night and it was reaaaallllllly good!  Yum yum! I could eat it all day!
i love target!! my mommy is going to take me today!! yay! i am going to try to get her to buy me lunch too because she was going too because my team was going out to eat, but i did not want to because there is no one there that i can really hang out with except for meagan and she found out about it too late. i am out!
A lot of people are coming to my house today!!  Karsen can't come though because she got pink eye. Waaa. :(  We are going to sleep in a tent and stare at the stars! How exciting. :)
I didn't get invited to LAURA'S TOMORROW!  ;)  I did, however, invite myself up in August. But y'all already knew that. I was talking to Ethan today, telling him about it and I think I scared him with my excitedness. =D I'm good at that. Scaring people I mean.  Heh, Tommy makes me laugh. I love that boy. (random enough for you?)

Actually, it's my grandma's birthday as well so she's coming over for dinner. Amberly's spaghetti and meatballs are on the menu.  YUM!  Right now I'm eating (or sucking on) one of those huge jawbreakers. I LOVE THEM! It'll be fun to eat it while I'm reading The Three Musketeers...  That sounds nice. I'm off! =P
