Today: bike riding, rowing machining, and DeBary going.  Good ride this morning, although i have to get the Emo off my iPod.  I used to keep a lot f music on there that i though other people might like (which accounts for the Emo), but any more to hell with it.  It's really hard to change the track while on the bike.  I have to reach around into the outside pocket of my back pack, and try and find the iPod, otherwise i ahev to go hands free, slip on strap off my shoulder and dig around in there while doing 14 to 20 MPH, and being totally invisiable to automobiles.  At the gym, i have to stop my faux rowing, and it can be kind of painfull to get back into the groove.  Ok, so i'll stop whining, but damn, I really hate Jets to Brazil.  How did i not know this about myself?!
Well, day three of not riding my bike is going just as planed.  Not that I wanted to not ride my bike, but it turns out that my occupation has required that I do some traveling as of late.  My destination is/has been the township DeBary, Fl which touts it's self as "The River City."  I'm not so sure that it is city so much as state road 17-92, and a "Lil' Champ" food mart some twenty odd miles from any place I’d rather be.  The pace of life is slower in DeBary, reminding one of the simple things in life like summer days, palmetto bugs, and Chinese water torture.  In DeBary a dollar will still buy you enough rope to hang a man where ever fine ropes are sold.  In DeBary the tap water smells like farm equipment.  In DeBary 12 year old children can vote.  In DeBary, I’ll watch another 5 hours of my life creep by today waiting for corporate pamphlets roll off the printing press.
New Plan:   Joined a gym near the office, will ride my bike the 15 mile round trip from home to work every day.  Will bring change of clothes and shower at gym in the morning.   Expected Results:   Save money on gas, at least enough to off set the price of the gym membership.  Will save money on electricity; taking a shower at the gym saves hot water produced by my water heater, the most inefficient device ever created.  Will not be tempted to smoke in the car on the way to work, i.e. I will not be in the car, but on a bicycle.  Will be unfat.   Drawbacks:   While making sure that the gym provided individual shower stalls, that does not guarantee that you will be totally shielded from the naked people.  8:30 in the morning is way too early, rather it is always way too early to be in the same room with a naked man, much less engage in conversation with one.  One must get up early to ride to ones bike a particular distance.  When one over sleeps, one is unable to ride ones bike to work in timely order.  One is however, while sitting in traffic, able to see an old lady that looked like Lou Reed.  Had one been responsible, one may have missed out on this anomaly.
Today: day one, not smoking.  Came up with alternate plan, no name, but it is centered around the notion of not quitting smoking.  Lisa does not think this is such a good idea.  Stay the course.  We have abandoned ship on TGSO.  Yesterday we pooled the cigarettes we had left for the remaining days of the program, something like 15, and smoked them all.  Today in place of cigarettes I have had three bagels and a bike ride through college park to my bank.  Feeling ok.  A little spacey really with is better then the full tilt anger I experienced this morning while working on the database (Angered at my Disappointment, might I point out.)  Curse you Sir Walter Raleigh you were such a stupid Git.
TGSO plan is turning into a farce.  This is ridiculous.  For all of you who dare tread that well worn two lane path of kicking the smoking habit/cruel addiction be forewarned TGSO is not for every one.  Many disclaimers say “contact you physician before starting any…” I say contact your compulsive edgy side, he/she knows you better than any M.D. ever will.  For those of you who would rather not read The Sloth in its entirety, or for that matter Lisa’s copious chronology of the process known as the TGOS (http:/thegreatsmokeout.blogspot.com) I’ll pair it down for you.  Smoke many cigarettes on day one and then systematically cut back over the following 14 days.  Sounds pretty good right?  Bite me!  It’s like quitting every day for 14 days.  14 days of angst and panic, and having no excuse to go outside during the work day.  Actually it’s worse than that because you are still smoking, and smelling of smoking, and feeling crooked in the eyes of healthy bright skinned nonsmokers who make more money than you do, and who have a gym membership that they actually put to good use, and kitchen appliances made of stainless steel, and a water heater that runs on gas which predates 1985, and cuts back on electric costs.  My friend Sandie has been off the squares for a year now.  While she was never the nicotine fiend that I was/am she did it (Go you!) and tells me that cold turkey is the only way to go.  I’ve never understood why they call it cold turkey, (Is cold turkey a cure-all for the shakes of smack withdrawal?) never the less, I think I hear that chilly bird calling my name.  3 smokes down, 3 to go for the day.
Sigh, just smoked cig # 5 on day 5 of TGSO.  Damn it.  Only alotted eight today.  Down to 3.  Wow.  Sorrow.  That is all.
A so-so day behind the desk:  Hair becoming difficult.  An awkward stage.  No amount of product has the wherewithal to tame my wayward locks, a
