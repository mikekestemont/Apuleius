He posted a new picture today. In it he’s wearing his favorite (awful) yellow jacket, with his favorite (awful) somewhat matching tie, and his (only) nice pair of black pants. He looks like a pretentious (yes) hipster (not). In the other picture he’s standing next to his (former) motorcycle in his leather jacket (trying too hard to look alpha).   He loves word games. He thinks it’s clever to be able to decipher the mathematical equation or meaning behind a group of letters. To him it’s a mark of intelligence. He considers himself an intellectual (jackass). He is extremely articulate. He thinks his PhD entitles him to all of his (superficial) desires. He does not understand the value of hard work outside of academia. He has never seen outside of his (very small) box.  He has a deep voice and a dominant personality. He likes to be in control. He likes to be mysterious. He’s self-absorbed and self-indulgent. He rarely, if ever, thinks of other people. Unless (of course) he gains something from thinking of said other person. He is a monster in bed and a phenomenal kisser. He’s only kinda cute until you get him naked. Then he’s gorgeous.    He calls himself fearless and he probably believes it. He thinks emotions are a waste of time. He looks down on the act of feeling as weakness. He is (overly) rational and (always) logical. Everything has to fit into his plan.   (I didn’t.)
Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone, Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone, Silence the pianos and with muffled drum Bring out the coffin, let the mourners come.  Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead Scribbling on the sky the message He Is Dead, Put crepe bows round the white necks of the public doves, Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.  He was my North, my South, my East and West, My working week and my Sunday rest, My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song; I thought that love would last for ever: I was wrong.  The stars are not wanted now; put out every one: Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun; Pour away the ocean and sweep up the woods: For nothing now can ever come to any good.  W.H.Auden XX ~ The Collected Poetry of W. H. Auden 1945
Noise. Loud music. Flashing images from the television. Pulsing floors resulting from the surround sound maxed out. I think best this way. If I turn it off the rest of me goes into full throttle, blocking out my inner voice. With the noise my voice comes out clearly, distinctly, separate from the rest of the chaos. With the noise I don’t have to create the chaos – it’s already there.  Five of us sit in a circle playing board games. It’s Tuesday – we do this every Tuesday. The game changes but the names stay the same. This week it’s Taboo, next week Pictionary. I like any of the games that are word games. I’m good at word games and letter manipulations. I’m not so good at pictures, visualizations or numerical representations.  I don’t like where this is going, it’s boring. Maybe I should turn off the noise. Maybe I should see if I can block out the rest of the chaos without adding more. Maybe, then, it wouldn’t be so boring. Maybe it’s not that boring and I’m just mental. Boring aside, maybe I’m just mental.  Sanity is lacking these days. A friend of mine told me was at loose ends and I wanted to tie them up for him. I wanted to fix it because I didn’t want him, of all people, to be at loose ends. To be confused, or unclear about his future. That’s my job,   I think.

The big one. He rocks.    Meeting Mike's incredibly cool roommates. It's funny, I'll likely never see or talk to them again, but they made such an impression it was worth mentioning.    Staying awake over 26 hours on my first day there because of the time change.    Going the wrong way on a streetcar but ending up in a really cool neighborhood because of it. Having a sense of direction is entirely overrated.    Discovering BART - mass transit, as a whole, fascinates me. I'm currently framing my BART map to hang next to my NY (a model for all to envy), Chicago (""L""), Boston (""T""), and London (Tube) maps that were acquired on previous trips. Admittedly, the Bart was the prettiest rapid transit route I've ever been on.    Shonen Knife and Deer Hoof show in SFO.    Walking up the hill that is Berkeley. I should have gone to college there.    Walking around a strange (to me) city but still being comfortable in my own skin.
So. Very. Tired.
It's Wednesday. I swear, it was just Saturday. And just January. And just Y2K. And Dean was just the front runner. Where is the time going?
Last night the boy and I and had a fight. Again. See - I thought he was coming for dinner based on a conversation we had the night before. I made dinner. He didn't even call until 7ish and he lives an hour away. I, of course, flipped and thought he was standing me up. Left him a few messages - which infuriated him.  He was jonesin for a fight, really. You could tell. If it hadn't been the messages i left it would have been something else. He was still furious that he missed his train after we hit over an hour of traffic the day before. That, by the way, was my fault. I am t
