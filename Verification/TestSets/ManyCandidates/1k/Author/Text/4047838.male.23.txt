I honestly think that certain stones bring certain energies to the bearer. This has also been noted by many cultures across the globe. The Maori of Aetearoa is one such culture whom believe in this. They believe that the bearer of, and even those who just lay their eyes on pounamu, or jade or nephite or serpentine, will inherit the  Mana  of the stone.  The following qualities have been attributed to Pounamu:   Kindness   Comes through in its wamth, lustre and brilliance   Honesty and integrity   Its interior can be viewed from outside revealing its inner beauty   Bravery   Can only be broken but never twisted out of its true shape formed by the artist   Friendship   Becomes warm when worn against the body and soaks up the body oils of the owner becoming one with them.  Different shapes also signify different things,&nbsp;I have a carving of a Toki or an adze, and that brings Honour and Strength to the bearer.&nbsp; I forgot to wear it today, and the strength has definitely been lacking, not only physical strength (thats due to my tubbiness, no excuses there), but also my emotional strength.
The sedentary office life has taken its toll, as I 'accidentally' glimpsed into the mirror during my lunch break, I noticed that I have become a tubby bitch. The cheekbones that was once quite prominent is no more, they have gone, wrapped in a cosy blanket of Cal blubber. Its disgusting. Time for a revamped excercise regime, gotta find ways of losing weight, all I have is Dragon Boat, but that is wearing thin. I am often reminded that its my damn Virogan personality that makes me change my mind so often about so many different things. One thing that hasn't changed since I was 9 years old, however, is my fondness for Martial Arts. From the childish ninja impersonations to&nbsp;the deep cultural pride that has developed, I have always found some sort of derived benefit.  Having said that though, I find my beloved chosen tradition to be somewhat lacking. Not enough conventional western cardio excercise, and thus, my tubby ass.  I'm just looking for excuses for my laziness. I'm just a lazy biatch, no more excuses.
If we could look at the world in&nbsp;a trance of wonderment, appreciate all its amazing life forms, see the sky and the earth in its natural glory and to not be distracted by the overload of undigestible, incomprehensible load of knowledge, so called news.   News produced for&nbsp;privately owned networks, market-driven companies, using the public's free air space. You're paying for your own air space! Its not news, its entertainment. Get cable instead.
I had such grand plans once, everyone does I think. Everyone plans and these plans become 'knowledge', or atleast what we think is knowledge, in reality its nothing more than expectations. Expectations however is nothing more than a goal. While its nice to have, it never really is the place where your dreams come true, because invariably, you have new plans.   But imagine if we did know, I mean  really  know  , what our future held for us. Think about it, it may not tell you&nbsp;what&nbsp;you want to hear exactly, it might not match your  plans . What then?&nbsp; What if you were destined to become a pauper? I don't know about you, but I don't think I'd like to hear that! Would you really want to know?   Whats the point I hear you say? No point silly, its a blog!   But here is something I've been dwelling on for the last 3 years:  Expectations  can all too often end in  Disappointment .
When confronted with instances of verbal racism, all I could do was giggle nervously like a schoolgirl. On the one hand I despised the Redneck, but on the other, I felt powerless to criticise, afterall, I was at work and everything&nbsp;I said was being recorded,&nbsp;I also empathised with the verbal progenator's particular&nbsp;situation (put there by my employer) and somewhat sympathised with him. He only knew what he heard, and that happened to be a persistent telemarketer with a thick sub-continental accent. Despite that, I should not have laughed and encouraged such anti socio-politico-cultural behaviour. I am part of the problem.   I've put a '1' after the title because I know this is a subject that I will continue to touch on in the days to come.
The quarter life crisis is&nbsp;probably one ofthe most&nbsp;terrible things in life, it ranks EQUALLY with the other -life crisis'. For sure, they're different issues, but when it boils down to it, its all about life decisions.   I look around me in this call centre, and catch my reflection,&nbsp;I look hot! But thats not the point, the point is, I am surrounded by people of all ages, in different stages of their lives.  I really should  take some mental notes, and I suppose in many ways I have. I can't do this forever, my ego won't allow me to. It may seem like a sorry point to be motivated by, but its a source of motivation nontheless.   Now all I have to do is work out what I'm going to do in the near future to correct the position I have found myself in.
Life is so transient, so mutable, so ever changing. the winds of time alter everything in its path. Those of you who think that things won't, are seriously deluding yourselves. But hey, I guess thats the beauty of life, the very same things that creates momentary grief for us, is also, at the very same instance, the thing that we all write about, the same thing that motivates people like me and Sheryl and the next blogger and...er well maybe not you, since you're looking into this window,&nbsp;a window of&nbsp;my time, in your time. Whats time? But anyways...  Its all beautiful isn't it?
Its nice to be important, but its important to be nice.
I would like to write something positive today. Afterall, it is raining and the Earth is being nourished. I've been on a roll lately, emotionally, I'm feeling strong, I feel like I can do anything! I t
