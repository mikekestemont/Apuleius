Went to a horrible show last night. We only stayed for 1 act.   Thanks to Ryan for having us over at his house. It was a fun time hanging out with the cats, his sisters, and watching some Street Fighter II Turbo on the Super Nintendo.   -   Today was alot of fun. A group went to Falling Water (sorry Matthew). It was fun. Lots of jumping off rocks into the water, sliding around on algae rocks, and wondering where in the world Bobby and Chris were the whole time.   Hope everyone had a fun holiday. I'm off to get some pizza and chill. Halo is calling my name though....it's been a few days.
Well today has been a sweat so far. I played drums at church which is always fun, because I'm not really a drummer. I'm moving out of my apartment today. It's kinda weird. I've changed so much while being there.    I will probably be staying at the Blaylock house for a few days because I'll be homeless until Tuesday or Wednesday.    Currently disliking: the stairs I have to climb to get to my apartment.
Lately I've been sleeping on the floor for about the past 2 weeks. I've come to realize that it may not be the best way to sleep. Which brings me to an entirely different question.    What did people way back when, such as Adam and Eve, sleep on? Leaves for clothing....I doubt they had a pillowtop california king mattress to catch some zzzzz's.    I found the floor very comfortable for about 10 days. Now it seems to be hindering me more than helping. Maybe it should be done in moderation. Nonetheless, I shall try the futon again.
Halo has to be the ultimate video game of all time! It will forever withstand the test of time and constant evolution of technology.   Bungie, I love you so much for designing this game. Please hurry with Halo 2.
YES! I love 80s hair-metal guitar playing fools in my place of work. It makes my day so much brighter to watch someone so painfully go up and down a guitar neck while straining their neck out and making quite possibly the ugliest face I've ever seen.   Rock and Roll will never die!                How does Jerome (not my brother) @ Taco John's do it. They offer "generous portions of freshly made Mexican food. Cooked to my order. Served to me by friendly people. And all for a fair and honest price."   Currently Eating:  Taco John's #2 w/ side of cheese dip
Las Palmas was short-staffed....which means no birthday singing. It was a good time anyways. Thanks to my homies for the small ceremony.  I'm at work and just counted inventory for about 10000 sets of guitar strings. How fun!
Today is my 23rd birthday. I graduated last week....didn't even go to the ceremony.   The band came up with a new song that alot of you will like. It's very interesting, now it's up to Wes to make up some words.   Pray, pray, pray, pray. God wants to hear you.
This may be the last post for a while. Cornerstone is tomorrow. 4AM sucks. We should have done all of this junk earlier. I'm getting what I deserve right now.    Once we arrive I'm sure I'll enjoy it, but right now is just stupid. It's nearly 10pm and we're still not asleep. Sounds like the trip to Nashville - except that was only 6 hours.    Anyone who reads this please keep all of us Russvegas kids and anyone else going in your prayers. There will be much driving.    I'm gonna take my laptop and see if I can find a wireless connection somewhere.......
Well, I've been told the show went great! Thanks to everyone for coming out. It was good to see many friends there, the numbers are growing - it's awesome! I had a lot of fun making some new xfriendsx too.  After the show,  urlLink Kasey  and his family were unbelievably hospitable. I love that guy (and Hal too!). I wish he was in a band so I could go watch him play, I bet he'd be fun to watch. I guess I'll have to settle for watching his brother in  urlLink Very Much So .  - Now for the good stuff. I got a sunburn on my shoulders yesterday. :) It's really splotchy and I think almost kind of cool. This of course came from swimming - our new favorite hobby. Halo is getting a bit old (we need Halo 2). At least swimming keeps me active, otherwise playing music is the only time I burn any calories.  Check out some of Dr. Inch's books. If you like reading smart people literature, he's for you. I can't make it through half a page without having to read something over again. He goes to my church and does a sermon every once in a while. It's so precious - he's pretty old and he wears the same "bowling-style" shirt every time he preaches.
TONIGHT!   urlLink deas vail , india, and  urlLink abel  scroll down for more info.  ---  In other news, I really really wish I had more patience. The most ridiculous things bother me. Right now I just would much rather be hanging out with my crew.  Maybe some of you people will start post something today so I'll have something to draw my attention away from work.  Currently: Twiddling my thumbs.  I am so ready for the show tonight. Me = emo boy. I wanna dance during the music.
