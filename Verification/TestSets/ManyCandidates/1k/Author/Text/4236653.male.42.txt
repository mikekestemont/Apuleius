There are a few people from my past I'd like to say hi to and see what they've been up to.  If a search engine were to fly by this blog some time in the furture, let it pick up on the names of:  Mike Myers John Hogan Dennis Redman Paul Hubbard Art Ritter Alice Coelho Don Staples Gary Grimes  Let me know how you're all doing.
While a few posts ago I stated my hatred of all things Michigan and having my life ripped away from me. There are some advantages.  With some of the money that I got from my pension, I bought a Martin D16 acoustic guitar and started re-learning how to play it.  It had literally been years since I last played a guitar. I stopped playing back when my first marriage dissolved. I wasn't very good to be sure, but I was learning little by little. But now I'm back in full force learning everything I can. The advantage is that I have all day long to practice and learn!  I've been playing now for 7 months now, by far the longest I've ever spent on an interest other than computers and movies. I usually get interested in something, absorb a vast about of knowledge about it, then 2 weeks later dump it in favor of something new. So far the guitar has hung around.  I love this Martin. It's the cheapest  real  Martin you can get. When I say "real" I mean made in USA, all solid wood construction (no Korean made plywood Martins here). It sounds like a dream now that 7 months of playing have opened up the wood and it resonates like a bell.  The thing now is, I'd also like to pick up an electric guitar...but that is much more money because you have to buy the guitar, the amp, the cords, the effects etc etc. It's like a never ending quest for a different tone. With the acoustic though, you concentrate on actually  playing  instead of effects.  I may be getting to the point though where I'm going to have to start taking formal lessons, because I really have no direction in my learning. I know the major chords by heart and quite a few minor and weird ones, plus some songs with alternate tunings....but no theory really.  We'll see how it goes....
What a weird time it was in 1977. Let's see, there was the New York Blackout, Star Wars was first hitting the big screen and changing the world. Son of Sam was running amok. John Wayne died.  And the King of Rock & Roll passed away on this day in 1977. I was 15 at the time back then and I remember my parents were HUGE Elvis fans. We had quite the collection of Elvis albums my Mom would play all the time. It was weird though that the "King of Rock &amp; Roll" was only heard on Country & Western radio stations back then.  Actually, dying was the best thing to happen to Elvis. Think about it, if he was still alive today, not only would he be very old, he would probably be out there performing oldies shows...showing up in cameos in movies and generally still out there on talk shows. If he died today, I doubt there would have been such a big outpouring of grief for him as there was in 1977. Marlon Brando just died and he was a HUGE icon in movies. If he had died back then, perhaps the same thing would have happened to him as it did with Elvis, James Dean, Monroe and others. As it was, when he died two months ago it was a major story to be sure, but now it's died down. The tributes are over. Elvis' tributes are STILL going on!  As Neil Young said:  "It's better to burn out, then to fade away"
Here the great George Carlin explains away the Ten Commandments:  Here is my problem with the ten commandments- why exactly are there 10?  You simply do not need ten. The list of ten commandments was artificially and deliberately inflated to get it up to ten. Here's what happened:  About 5,000 years ago a bunch of religious and political hustlers got together to try to figure out how to control people and keep them in line. They knew people were basically stupid and would believe anything they were told, so they announced that God had given them some commandments, up on a mountain, when no one was around.  Well let me ask you this- when they were making this shit up, why did they pick 10? Why not 9 or 11? I'll tell you why- because 10 sound official. Ten sounds important! Ten is the basis for the decimal system, it's a decade, it's a psychologically satisfying number (the top ten, the ten most wanted, the ten best dressed). So having ten commandments was really a marketing decision! It is clearly a bullshit list. It's a political document artificially inflated to sell better. I will now show you how you can reduce the number of commandments and come up with a list that's a little more workable and logical. I am going to use the Roman Catholic version because those were the ones I was taught as a little boy.  Let's start with the first three:    I AM THE LORD THY GOD   THOU SHALT NOT HAVE STRANGE GODS BEFORE ME    THOU SHALT NOT TAKE THE NAME OF THE LORD THY GOD IN VAIN    THOU SHALT KEEP HOLY THE SABBATH
It's Sunday afternoon here. The In-laws are here working on fixing a few things in our house, namely the leaking upstairs shower.  Sundays usually start out bad as it's the big newspaper delivery day. The South-Bend Tribune that I deliver is usually pretty big and Kristen, my wife, has to ride with me to help me deliver. It also gives us time to talk about things.  We hashed it out again today, with me stating my concerns to her that I laid out to e
