K..most of you who know me...know that i am TERRIFIED ...ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIED of bees, wasps, hornets and any other things with stingers. Yes Janice and Jo...laugh it up..all of my screaming and running over the years becuz of all the bees i've encountered. Yes well...a bee was in my laundry room today...and i FREAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKED OUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT! i wuz going insane. so then my&nbsp;lil sis comes home and we&nbsp;found it sitting on a shoe RIGHT by the door we needed to open to get it out.&nbsp;K...so we unlock the door and open it..nudging the shoe. We were&nbsp;so scared that this thing wuz gonna attack us...bees *shiver* K so then we opened it all the way and shoved a&nbsp;rolled up newspaper&nbsp;in the opening to keep it from closing. Then we threw another paper at it&nbsp;to get it to fly out the door and RAAAAAAAAAAN. lol...it's funny and SO retarded now...but i&nbsp;wuz scared SHITLESS at the time. Yes...laugh at me...let's see how much you laugh when UR in that situation. And this bee wuz huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuugeo okay? HUGE :P hehe NEways...yes. I'm sorry you guyz that i couldn't go out to the movies today..and it wuz even a movie i wanted to watch. But well...u g2 do wut u g2 do :P Other than that...it wuz a fairly uneventful day. I&nbsp;just wanted you guyz to know about my&nbsp;horrendous experience with the bee.&nbsp;oh and by the way janice, YOU&nbsp;ARE included in the torturing of ryan and tupac. By "guyz" i meant&nbsp;janice, jen, me and kelly...cuz we were the&nbsp;ones being pinched. *duh* :P hehe. K well neways&nbsp;i'll post again soon.&nbsp;Byez *luv*&nbsp;
Jo don't worry!! you didn't DO nething. Just ur comments are a little yellingish. Way to HATE ME! :( Now i'm feeling unloved.    Today wuz too awesome you guyz...i didn't even have to GET UP and&nbsp;WALK&nbsp;:D hehehehe excellent. Yes yes...i'm lazy. :P I agree with you tash...monkey should definitely TRY HARDER! But...i dunno..i can't torture him...that's too cruel. Maybe...JUST maybe the balls to the keg of fireworks...but even THAT seems a bit too harsh. Maybe i'll just punch him in the face a few times and pull his hair REALLY HARD! :D That works.    The faking of the doing it with Ryan sounds while he was on the phone was i think BY FAR one of the best events of tonite...or it could have been Janice and Ryan REALLY going at it on ur basement floor tash..that wuz so totally R-RATED! :P *blech* heheheh jokes guys...don't kill me *grins*    I swear tho...stoopid and stoopidette are SO gonna get it tash...the way this guy is treating you...UGH KILL HIM NOW! *anger filled* :P We'll get him...don't worry tash we'll get him. mwahahhahahahhahahahahahhahahahhahahhHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHA.    Sorry Ryan..i didn't mean to bite you THAT hard :) Oh and tash..the show tonite wuz awesome ;) hahaha ...hey i didn't break my promise so you can't kill me :D SEXY GIRL COMING THROUGH hahahha :D sorry sorry...*ahem* this is me...stopping now.    And i REALLY wuz full on my wonderful two slices of red pepper and three smarties...okay so maybe not...shut up :P    Janice's amazing quote of the day "I think we should shove a broom handle up her crotch until it breaks"   Me- what's "it" supposed to be referring to??   Janice-i can't SAY IT!   hahahhah best thing EVER :)    Neways...got home from tash's and lay on my bed listening to the rain...one of the most relaxing things to do in the world. Oh yeah..and thanx for basically saying i wuz coming on tuesday with ur cuzin t
