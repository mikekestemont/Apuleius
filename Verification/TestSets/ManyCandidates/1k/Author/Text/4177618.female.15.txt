Yup. That's right, I actually talked to him yesterday. However, I think I might have pissed him off, despite what he says. I don't know! I really want to apologise... but I'm afraid. Of him being angry with me. I just.. don't like being on anyone's bad side. But if I apologise, I'll have to clarify what I meant, but I'm not sure how to do that...  I hate this.  -----  Session Start (Fri Aug 20 00:05:25 2004 Me: Alright, so I have another, if slightly more stupid, question. Kyle: hit me! Me: er.. well, that wasn't wuite what I had in mind, but.... Me: :D Me: Anywho. I was wondering about, if you could only be remembered for one thing, what would it be? Kyle: wow Kyle: thats a big question Me: yeah, I realized that after I actually thought about it Kyle: i dont know Kyle: i'd hate for it to sound like a cliche... but i'd like to inspire someones life. even if its just to one person Me: ... what else were you going to say? Kyle: i dont know Kyle: its a really dep question Kyle: something id have to think about Me: well, you could always think and get back to me Kyle: yeah Me: a reason to keep in touch, which we haven't really been doing too much. Kyle: what about you? Me: me? I only thought about it for a bit, but I think I'd want to be remembered for being myself. Like... I dunno. Being able to inspire people would be nice, but I can't see it happening, if only because... I dunno. Just being myself I guess.... Me: of course, that would mean taking the good stuff, like any maturing and goodness I may have had, with the bad stuff, like how much I still had to do to meet even my own standards. Which are pretty loose sometimes. Especially when I'm around the people who don't expect me to be as mature as I should be. Kyle: right...but the thing is... this question is like asking what do you hope to achieve in yout life Kyle: i think its something that slowly answers itself with time as you get older Me: I really hope so. Kyle: its pretty much like asking what the meanig of you life is Me: I suppose... and as I was trying to get my mind around saying, I think it's just to... mature, and learn more about yourself and life... and that's still not quite what I want to say. I just can't put it into words. Me: And that doesn't explain why we do this... why do we have morals? Me: heh. that sure got my mind moving, I suppose. Kyle: i know Me: ...you were going to add on again Kyle: was i? Kyle: lol Me: well, it looks like it. the thing keeps saying that you're still typing, but nothing else ever comes up. Me: so... what exactly are the lyrics for And Still? Me: ..I must seem like a stalker sometimes. It's not on purpose, I swear. I'm just really curious about your band. Kyle:  (I'm cutting them out 'cause they're copyrighted, methinks.)  Me: ah. I can hear it now. Heh. Funny how that works. Kyle: i know Me: of course, it isn't the best quality recording, but that's perfectly understandable too. Did you write it on your own? Kyle: yeah Kyle: you gonna buy the CD Kyle: its 5$ Me: mm. And I seem to recall you saying that you had no idea what romantic love was like.  Kyle: and there are 5 songs Me: I totally will, but I don't know when I'd ever get the chance Kyle: lol Kyle: i dont Me: lol Me: you jsut write about Me: just Me: it Me: that was some horrible grammar.... Kyle: i dont know... that songs just about how someone can hurt you so bad but you'll still love them Kyle: is a really simplified summary Me: yes, I suppose. it just seems to be about love Me: maybe I"m just overly romantic. craving roses and stuff. heh. Kyle: no Kyle: its about love Me: but not romantic love? Kyle: no, it is... but its not about real love... its like loving something that not only you'll never have but that will hurt you Kyle: but as much pain as you go through at the hands of this love... you still love Me: ... yeah... a very realistic concept. Unfortunately. Well, depending on your outlook, I suppose. But the ideal world isn't about to come along. Me: So, when will I get to buy the cd? Kyle: at a show  Me: oh yeah? when's the next one? Kyle: not sure Kyle: i'll keep you posted Me: heh. alright. yet another reason to keep in touch. Music. Me: hey, do you want a card for your birthday? Kyle: nah no need for that... thanks for the message on nexus Kyle: :) Me: yeah. sorry if it sounds kinda cheesy. I sound like that a lot when it's two in the morning. which it normally is for me. eheh.... Me: I need a better sleeping pattern. Kyle: lol Kyle: thanks for offering though Kyle: for the card Me: well, if you change your mind, I'm sure I can think of something to draw for you. I'm still lacking in much inspiration. which makes me very unhappy, in general. Me: you know, I still associate "hear you me" with you. I dunno why. Kyle: lol Me: yeah, and it's a pretty depressing song to be associated to, too. Kinda stupid, especially since you're not dead or anything. I guess it has to do with it having been your display name at onep oint or something. Me: wow, I've been talking a lot. again. Me: you never complain. why is that? Kyle: lol Kyle: cause i dont mind it Me: don't mind what? my mindless blathering? yeah, but... you never complain about anything else either Kyle: lol Kyle: i complain about a lot o
