Almost finished with neck increases on Ole sweater.  should be done by next week.    Picked up some faux mohair on ebay yesterday - plan to use it with the red two-two for the sweater in FCEK.  Also the sock yarn I ordered came yesterday - very nice!  I have midterms coming up so I really have to stop knitting and start studying!
First day of my first blog - very excited to start - though not real sure about what I am doing. I am definitly not up on this!
Well it is the last day of 2003 - Can't say I all that sorry to see it go!   My NY'S Resolution for 2004 is to learn to knit these blasted socks, I have frogged these at least a dozen times. Posted a message on socknittersSAM to help me figure out what I am doing wrong.    I started them in Four Seasons Hot Socks and size 2 DP's, but I am not used to working with such small needles and fine yarn - I am going to do the beginner toe up sock in WW and large needles - I hope that will help.   Got a response from the skSAM - tonight will be spent trying this out while waiting for the ball to drop!
Will start working on the kids socks in camo soon, first I want to finish the Sonnet sweater from knitty.  I also started a shawl in a diamond pattern (from the lion brand website) in the Violet Bunny I have.  There are only 4 skeins so all I could make was a hat and scarf or a shawl - and I really wanted to do some lace work, but not too fine.  Since this is a bulky yarn it is going really quickly.  I seem to be knitting a lot of purple this winter - the sonnet is aubergine, the shawl is violet and the shape it scarf is in lavander.  My SIL sent me a photo of my nephew in the mexicali sweater I knit him for Christmas - he looks so cute (the sweater is not bad either!)
Finished the first pair on camo sock - they look cool - I think the boys will like them.  I need to finish that next pair before the end of this month so they can both take them camping.  Of course I started a new project, the bell lace socks on SocknittersSAM.  I turned my first heel last not - really would have like more detailed directions, but as it is an advanced class the instructions assume the knitters know how to do this alreadty.  They don't look too bad though - I guess I got most of the directions right without really knowing what I was doing.  I need at least 1 more skein of Jo Sharp DK for the Sonnet - I am doing the sleeves on circs down from the shoulders and I am really liking how it looks!  Finally set up a Picturetrail acct, so now all I have to do is figure how to get them to show up here.
When I got to yoga last night, I found out that my instructor had had her baby about a week earlier than she was expecting!&nbsp; So when I got home last night I cast on a baby hat out of some pretty dk wt confetti colored cotton yarn I had in my stash.&nbsp; I found a cute and easy pattern on line, I would like to have it finished by class next week - I will leave it at the office for her.  I went to the Career Service office last night to pick up the list of places that will sponsor MT's&nbsp;so they can treat till they can take the State Boards and get their license.&nbsp; Most of them are on LI but a few are in Queens and Manhattan.&nbsp; I will try calling a couple today.&nbsp; I doubt I will get much knitting done this weekend.&nbsp; I have to treat tmrw in clinic, then I am going for my&nbsp;2nd acupuncture treatment.&nbsp; Sunday I am going to an aromatherapy workshop,&nbsp; it is an all day program and I have to fit that damn path paper in there somewhere too!
Well I got a call back from school today - I need to get the CPR/First Aid certs in before school ends - soooo today I registered for the classes with the Red Cross - had to take 2 days off from work,  My boss was NOT happy, but I will have both by Aug 5 and the last day of class is Aug 16 so&nbsp;will be ok. Whew!!&nbsp; I have got to learn to stop procrastinating!   On the needle front - I didn't do any knitting last night, I couldn't decide what to work on so I didn't work on anything.   David is going to set up space for me on our ISP so I can add pictures - then I should be able to add them to my blog.&nbsp; I think I may finally be getting the hand of this!
No School tonight, so I will have time to knit!&nbsp; I really should be spending time working on my path paper - It is due Aug 2, so I really don't have much time.&nbsp;......and I found out last night I have to get my CPR/First Aid cert. by next Friday!!!!!&nbsp; So what else would I do but spend time knitting?!?!  I really need to finish something.&nbsp;   &nbsp;
Finally back to posting!&nbsp; Only 4 more weeks of school and I am finished!!!!Of course I still have my path paper to write and my finals to go through, but the end is in site.  &nbsp;  I think I have finally figured out how to post pictures to my blog, so I am going to try it now.  &nbsp;  Nope still haven't gotten it, but I won't give up!!  &nbsp;  Other knitting news - started on David's birthday sweater - it's the classic pullover from "The Purl Stitch" - about the only sweater pattern he liked!  &nbsp;  About halfway d
