Hey guys, now umm here is a song that is SO just me. Opening my mouth and stuff just comes out without a thought. Anyway guys just chill as i complete Miss Raja's work!!    My stupid mouth Has got me in trouble I said too much again To a date over dinner yesterday And I could see She was offended She said "well anyway..." Just dying for a subject change  Oh, another social casualty Score one more for me How could I forget? Mama said "think before speaking" No filter in my head Oh, what's a boy to do I guess he better find one soon  We bit our lips She looked out the window Rolling tiny balls of napkin paper I played a quick game of chess with the salt and pepper shaker And I could see clearly An indelible line was drawn Between what was good, what just slipped out and what went wrong  Oh, the way she feels about me has changed Thanks for playing, try again. How could I forget? Mama said "think before speaking" No filter in my head Oh, what's a boy to do I guess he better find one  I'm never speaking up again It only hurts me I'd rather be a mystery Than she desert me  Oh I'm never speaking up again Starting now  One more thing Why is it my fault? So maybe I try too hard But it's all because of this desire I just wanna be liked I just wanna be funny Looks like the jokes on me So call me captain backfire  Oh, the way she feels about me has changed Thanks for playing, try again. How could I forget? Mama said "think before speaking" No filter in my head Oh, what's a boy to do I guess he better find one  I'm never speaking up again It only hurts me I'd rather be a mystery Than she desert me  Oh I'm never speaking up again Starting now

I was reading K. Anand, president of Arsenal Supporters Club Malaysia’s comments on Arsenal saying that people are saying untrue remarks about Arsenal and stuff like that and I just felt that I had to point out a few things.   First of all, all fans of their respective clubs tend to be bias and don’t tell me that you do not jump in joy whenever Manchester United losses. The MU fan that wrote in to you was probably too much writing to you and making the statement but come on. Be honest, deep inside Arsene’s heart, he wants the treble. You must know that. Arsenal fans will say that Van Nistelrooy overreacted when Vieira kicked out and the punishement handed out to the players later was too much whereas Manchester United fans will say that Vieira deserved the red card for kicking out and the Arsenal players were let go too easily. Which ever way you look at it, fans will have their different opinions on football.  Secondly, you were probably right to say that Arsenal was not arrogant this season unlike last season but Arsenal has not been gracious in defeat lately. Henry and Wegner have hinted if not stated that their successive defeats to Manchester United and Chelsea are caused by the hectic schedule of the Premier League. Yes, we must all admit that playing fifty over matches per season is too much for a human but that is where the strength-in-depth of a team comes in. Teams who play in Europe must have enough cover to enable the team to compete in all tournaments. Manchester United and certainly Chelsea are able to cope with it, so why not Arsenal? The reason I am not stating AC Milan and Real Madrid is because they have winter break where as the EPL doesn’t. Faruok has a point when he says that footballers are being paid up to 80 000 pounds a week so they should just get on with it and not complaint.  Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger claims it was easier for Manchester United to win the Treble in 1999 — but evidence does not back his theory. Wenger said: “I’d like to compare United’s draw in the FA Cup in 1999 to ours and I don’t think it’s comparable.”  But United could not have had it harder. They had to defeat Middlesbrough, Liverpool, Fulham, Chelsea, Arsenal, and Newcastle. Arsenal this term beat Leeds, Middlesbrough, Chelsea and Portsmouth before losing to United.  Wenger added: “The competition was not as strong in the Premiership. There are more teams now who can fight and compete with United.”  That was a comment that Arsene made. I am being fair just like you said and that really says something. Manchester United played more games than Arsenal that season and they lost Roy and Scholes in the final of the Champions League and yet they won. I will not take anything away from Arsenal since they are still unbeaten in the league and I just hope that Arsenal fans will not take anything away from Manchester United for winning the treble.  Another thing K. Anand, you have my commiserations and I really do mean it and not just saying it but I just hope that every football fan does not start verbally abusing other clubs’ fans as this may lead to gang fights.  My tuition teacher also said that it is ridiculous for a person to support Manchester United and to admire Thierry Henry at the same time but quite frankly I do not see why. I mean everyone has his or her own club but don’t tell me you can’t a
