&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chapter 1. The Irony of My Life  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Droplets of water from the faucet clash against the sink. Splat. Splot. Splash. The rhythmic beat continues on endlessly. The walls are gray and gloomy, with slight cracks and scratches in the corners. An ancient wooden bench stands unsteadily on my right, waiting for its days to be over. There are two filthy bunk beds in the room, even thought they are occupied by only one person, me. I guess I should be rather thankful that I’m the only one living in this cell, not being raped by the same sex and all, but I despise being lonely and left out. I’ve been here for…how long? With a pained moan, I twist my head around, to glance at one of the walls. I’ve been marking how long I’ve been here ever since I became imprisoned. Four big lines and three small lines… That’s 4 years and 3 days. For the last 1,427 days, I had to suffer through the depressing anti-drug/social life. The nasty food they give out here doesn’t help either. It just makes me crave for more and more of the outside world…  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am twenty-one years of age, still fresh and young. My parents named me Sally Rose Johnson, even though I was born the male gender. I guess they desperately wanted to have a daughter considering on the fact that they already had 6 boys of their own before I was born. That is, indeed, why they used to dress me up as a girl everyday when I was young. Of course, I didn’t know any better—until 3rd grade. People were making fun of me constantly, and I just couldn’t handle it. I confronted my parents one day, saying that I was a boy and I simply couldn’t be seen looking like a “prissy girl with pigtails” anymore. They took it extremely hard, cried for exactly 5 days and 16 hours, but eventually they agreed to make a deal that they would never make me dress up like a girl from that point on. After I finally started wearing boy clothes, I forced people to call me “Johnson” instead of my first name “Sally”. I thought it’d be a good way to begin my new “boyhood”. It took people a while to accept the name, but eventually, they all ended up calling me by the name that I desired.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having all six brothers that were into pot(marijuana), I began to experiment with drugs in 5th grade. I never really liked drugs, to be frank, but just the thought of being an “outlaw” kept me going. It’s pathetic, I know. In the next 2 years, before I knew it, I was selling drugs to kids that I both knew and didn’t know, encouraging them to join in. I had tons of sources to get drugs from— all over the state, partially because all my brothers were close friends with them. I charged drugs twice as much as other people did, but since I had the biggest variety, people came to me anyway. Before I knew it, I was actually rich. That was without a doubt the upside of my life. The downside of it…Well, let me tell you all about it…  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chapter 2. Four years ago…  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A puff of smoke exhaled out of the corner of my dry mouth. Being a senior was such a difficult task. No wonder people drop out of high schools. Who in the world would want to deal with colleges? Using only one hand, I veered smoothly to the right to exit out of highway. I was riding in a brand new BMW, bought recently using my own money, I’m proud to say. I’d saved enough money for the past years that I was able to afford a car and a good car at that. With my left hand, I slowly stuck the joint into my mouth and inhaled. It felt incredibly refreshing and relaxing. But I should’ve known better. Getting high while driving is over the line, even for me.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, some random ancient-looking Toyota jumped into my lane without any signal, or if there was, I couldn’t see and I completely lost the control of my car, Yelling in horror, I turned left, attempting to avoid a car crash. Oddly enough, I succeeded, but ended up doing a 360-degree turn and in the progress, the car crashed into a pole nearby, scratching and leaving a dent on the surface. Thankfully, there weren’t any cars behind me that could’ve gotten damaged along with mine. Being a protective car that it was, my car’s air bag popped out. I let out a muffled scream, my face heavily digging into the air bag. My hands trying to find the door handle, unlocked the door in a clumsy fashion. My body stumbled out the door, dropping the joint that I held in my hand onto the cement ground. I was breathing so fast that I thought my heart was beating 200 beats per minute. Finally calmed down, I turned to look at the damage done; let me tell you this, it didn’t look so good. I let out a sigh of frustration when I heard a voice.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “What happened here?”” A drawl came behind my back. Swiftly, I turned myself around. Because of the drug I was smoking, I nearly lost my balance in the process, but soon I was able to recollect myself. I concentrated my eyes on the person standing in front of me; it was a middle-aged cop. He had bushy copper hair that was poking out of his brand new Police hat. His tiny black eyes were almost invisible on his flabby red face. It made him look something between a fat filthy lion and an unattractive toad.&nbsp; I murmured out a curse as I stared silently at the man. Just play it cool, and everything will be all right, I thought to myself.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Nothing at all. I j
