It's getting harder to concentrate on the work at hand, but that's not surprising.  Got my itinerary mailed off today to the folks, copied all my travel documents and put my shoes in for repair. Nice work I say.  The English guys finished up their IG cleanse today, they were a lot of fun, kept playing pranks on Daniel, putting stuff up for sale on the intranet. Rather amusing and they will be missed around the office. Had to wear my Birk's to work this morning cause I left my shoes at the office, too painful to walk home in.  But I'll break them in properly once I get back, nice shoes if they didn't hurt so much in the heal. I have a Hotmail account now as well, figured I had better be contactable by some method, seeing as you can't roam if you are on prepay, that sucks.  I had better be off, I'm supposed to be at the trinity bar by now for trivia, I'm running late.  Only one day to go at work.
Tuesday was pretty much the usual, did I mention that Ada was back at work from her holiday, Michael is leaving to go to another job internally and Nick is heading over to our team on the 10th.  Methinks it will be a rather busy period. I also sorted out rent payment while I'm away which was a good move, otherwise it could have been a little embarrassing. Cell group was good, a new girl, Melody from Canada.  She lives down the road, but toward Redfern! not the nicest place to start living in Sydney. Read some more of that book today, still enjoying it, helps me as its written in a daily study type way which helps keep me a little more consistent. Wednesday tomorrow.
Back to the Journals, the weekend has passed and a new week has started. Back at work, which was more of the usual, it will be interesting to see if I can get all my tasks completed by the time I head out. I started reading that Maxwell book I bought on Sunday today, week 1, the law of the lid.  Some interesting points of difference between David and Saul's leadership styles and effectiveness. ie "Paul mistook his position as king for real leadership...when God no longer favored him, he thought the title of king entitled him to continue leading" David was never afraid to admit his shortcomings  and ask forgiveness, and took opportunities to grow in his leadership.  The book is looking pretty good.
Sunday was rest day, Church was good in the morning, and I signed up to pay touch with the Hillsong touch football team. The night services was really good, the message made me think, I got a copy so I could listen to it later, and give it to dad, so he can hear some of the teaching that we get over here.  I also bought a book called 'The 21 Most Powerful minutes in a Leaders Day' by John Maxwell, which looked like an interesting read/study while I'm away. They also had one of those hammer strength testers that you have to try to bang the weight upto the bell.  Not really very difficult but you need a little technique (wood chopping styles).  I managed it around 4/5 times in a row, apparently some dude managed to hit it 43 times in a row.  Now that is a good effort. The rest of Sunday I watched football on SBS and did washing, ironing etc.
Saturday was a nice day. Played a little touch down at Bronte beach, and Andrew dropped me in Green Square. There are a few discount/outlet stores down there which I decided to frequent.  Bought a pair of shorts and a pair of pants for $55, not to bad. Then I picked up a Puma visor at the Puma outlet store on Botany road, $20.  Then Leanne and Chris picked me up from their and we wandered out to the outlet stores at homebush. We we cruising out there and in Leanne's car listening to some NZ music, very relaxing (if you weren't the one driving in the traffic). I then proceeded to get a pair of shoes for $149 and a woollen jersey for $69. A bit of retail therapy for my Saturday afternoon. We popped over to Daves place and said hello, he's up from Melb at the moment and had the little one (Grayson) making us skip and all sorts.  Got home in time to watch the Warriors scrape through 17:16 to a semi final against the Panthers. The Swannies lost their semi against Brisbane unfortunately.
Friday, better day today. Of couse its Friday you say, didnt really get alot of work done today, but it was ok, got my coffee from City Grind in the morning and tried to get stuck in.  But other work cropped up that sort of got in the way with me finishing stuff off.    Had a look at my leave, looks like ill be a we bit in debit to the bank after my trip. No going home for Christmas after all, but Emma should be coming over for a while, so that will be good. Got all our tickets today for flights etc, very exciting. Got no tickets to the Warriors game on the weekend wich is a bit slack, hope they smash the Panthers, same goes for the Swanies.  Anyway, weekend looks like being a bit of a shop and a plan the trip weekend.  I need to see what I have got to take away, and whether I need to get anything extra to take away. Hopefully I'll get in a bit of touch rugger down at coggee on Saturday.  Well, I'm off.
Whoops I missed a day in there. Oh well Wednesday was pretty uneventful.  Went out to trivia last night as per usual, we came in seventh which means we win a 6 pack of beer (between the 8 or so of us), and then Leanne (Chris's new flame) dropped u
