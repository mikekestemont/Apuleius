Trying to be nice to a younger sister of a gap of seven years is hard no matter what your parent bribes you with. I've tried, really I have! When I pick her up from after-school care I actually pay attention after asking her "How was your day?" and I "play" with her. Well, to an extent- I don't mean Barbies and stuff ( I have a Rep to keep up)- just board games or I help her pick out a sweet outfit. I even went as far as taking her out with me today. We went into town for two hours. We ended up at the GoMa, at the kids play area where two guys of about 18 were sitting drawing cartoons. I wasn't too impressed with them but I guess some people are easily amused! After that we took a trip around the Art Store across the road then got the bus home. She was satisfied at her little outing. Who can say fairer than that?! Sounds like a good attempt at sister bonding. Doesn't it?
Morning world!  I'm determined not to let this blog go to waste so heres whats been happening-   Thursday   I hung out in town from 11am, after getting the bus into town with my brother. I went to the GoMa but ended up hanging with a friend. About 1pm I got really bored and for some reason desparatly wanted to be at school, so I made my way up there- hoping to see some friendly(ish) faces. Other than Jamie no one was pleased to see me. I managed to pick up my Appeasement and The Road to War stuff in History and have a quick gab with Mr Byars. Knowing precisely how much studying I'd done for Computing (nothing at all) he invited me to come up 4th period on Monday and do some work. Very nice of him I thought- especially since we've had so many ups and downs in the last few months. I'll take up the offer on Monday.  Later, mum came in ever so slightly tipsy and ordered us to bed at 8.45pm. I'm not sure she had a grip of the time and place she was in, nevertheless I watched TV in my room until I heard snores from her room...     Friday    After sleeping 12 hours I was reluctant to get out of bed! About 11am Theresa gave me a call telling me there was a gig at the Cathouse and did I want to go with her. Sure, it started at 7pm. Her friend David (the stalker-ish bible thumper from Rutherglen- we met him at the AP gig with Electric Eel) had called her and said that his band were playing and he invited her to come- tickets were only Â£4 from him!   So, after a day of wandering about the house in my PJ's- pretending to be doing some studying- I was off to the gig. 45 minutes on the bus and I was outside the Cathouse with Creepy Dave and a few people holding up "No Humping" signs with little Camels on them. I think I liked the "No Humping" people more than David, at least when I was with them I didn't feel so sickened. Persistantly calling Theresa, this married man (with a child), claims he has no bad intentions. Sure.   When Theresa showed up she managed to batter my newly pierced ear when hugging me. I also got to make a new friend by the name of Claire ( Theresa's 21 year old - engaged- best mate). We we're having a crackin' time up until I asked Theresa to get me a Coke because I didn't have any money with me (but I usually pay for everything at these gigs) and she didn't make a thing of it- her answer was " Yeah, sure- Diet or normal?" but just as she was about to go up David turned to me and spat at me-  "Don't you get your own drink?- Pay up!"...Everyone just stared at him. How rude! He really upset me but I know why he did it- he was jealous of how close I was to Theresa and was even more annoyed that I was dragging her off into the toilet to gossip every so often. He knew how suspicious I was of him- as was Claire. He actually invited them to a party- well you can guess what we said to him about that! When his band went on stage he took his place at the far right of the stage, almost hidden (this was after he told claire he was lead singer and lead guitarist). His brother, a small fat creature with glasses took hold of his Guitar- now I was so sure that this guy was only a tech tuning up the Guitars but to my horror when the lights went down and back up again I saw him there...from here on in the show I watched was horrific. David, trying to be something close to neo-punk or some form of mini-mosher wannabe was diving around the stage- really thinking he was the bees-knees and he just wasn't. It was a tragidy. Now, this was supposed to be the main band- Big Up to the Support bands, you were great- but the main event was so bad I was on the floor laughing. Now I will give them one thing- Davids brother, the lead Guitarist played very very well. Other than Theresa being a laugh, the night was awful. David had managed to give me a redface without reason and my ears were abused by his so-called music.
urlLink    James Marsters- My favourite Buffy Star! The only person I know who has a worse obsession with Spike than me is Theresa. Every inch of her bedroom door is caked in Buffy and Angel stickers. Not to mention her book collection- lining her shelves along with a few framed James pictures- nothing signed but then again he charges!! I think I should find a new obsession- but most of the guys I
