Aethor and Region traveled the Ice Road north from Thaen before turning west past the Ice Peaks. For two months they road hard along their course, dodging the scattered bands of goblins that patrolled Checle's northern border. When at last they had little choice but to continue on foot, they filled their packs with what was essential, and hid their saddlebags, and set the horses free to make their way home as they might.  They drew within sight of Ter-Cartin after a month on foot, and they knew they were in great danger at all times. Still, their strength was in surprise, for never had Lord Caroc considered an attack from the North, and lesser had he judged odds of spies, for that path was more perilous than any other in the west.  It was a moonless night on which they choose to approach Ter-Cartin. Region employed all of the arts she had studied at Dothnell, cloaking them in shadow and creating a gap in the tall stone fence just wide enough for them to ease through. Yet at the very moment when they might have succeeded, they were betrayed.   They were awaited by soldiers in the courtyard, and though not one their opponents was equal in skill to Aethor, and though two score of them fell beneath his singing blade, and another handful fell to Region, they were overwhelmed at last, and taken in chains into Ter-Cartin where Lord Caroc awaited them.  Little is known of what took place there, for never did Aethor or Region tell of those days, but among the slaves and prisoners there are some who survived and remembered the brave Lord of the Mirien and his lady.  It is said that they were taken to Lord Caroc and thrown to the ground beneath his throne, and Region rose at once to her feet in defiance of the Dark One, but Aethor had been sorely wounded and reached his feet only through great effort. Aethor and Region stood huddled together, in the shadow of the Dark One's throne, and Kuld, who was the Dark One's lieutenant, slithered towards them from the shadows. Aethor would not stand aside despite Kuld's commands, and so several goblins came forward and restrained him as Kuld took Region by the arm and released her from her bonds. Before she had recovered from her surprise, Kuld drew her near to the great black throne, and pushed her before his master.  Lord Caroc offered her an alliance then, between Rel Aren and Checle, if she would kneel to him, and swear her alliegiance, and choose to remain in Ter-Cartin as his queen; in return he would permit Rel Aren to remain free so long as its Princes did not wage war on him, and in time he would make her chatelaine of his domain, and train her in the arts denied her at Dothnell. Those who witnessed it say Region did not even pause to draw breath before refusing the offer, and Lord Caroc commanded Kuld to take both prisoners to the dungeons, and there they remained for two years.  It was late in the fall of 4048 when Region begged an audience from Lord Caroc. She was fearful and her spirit was broken and there was a horror in her eyes, but her flesh was unmarred and she was still beautiful to look upon; Lord Caroc now held dominion over all lands north of the Geant, save for Rel Aren whose might was still too much for his force, and he was called the Dark King. She fell to her knees before King Caroc's throne, and begged for mercy for Captain Aethor.  Lord Caroc then came down from his throne, and he lay his hand upon her, and she screamed as though the touch pained her, and Lord Caroc said, "I have named my price for mercy. Swear your alliance to me."  The lady trembled, and it seemed as though each sound that passed her lips diminished her, and in a halting voice, she swore out alliegiance to Lord Caroc, who accepted her oath with a mocking smile.  Cruel he was, and he had not forgotten her defiance nor those of her kin, and so be bid Aethor be brought before him, and Aethor was broken and bloody. His gaunt form hung limply between the guards that dragged him forth. The signs of torture could be clearly read on his flesh, and it is reported that even some of the goblins that hovered about Lord Caroc turned away in disgust.  Even as the guards dropped Aethor to the ground, Region started towards him, but Kuld appeared and grabbed her arm. Lord Caroc asended again to his throne and addressed Region. "One other thing I demand of you. You shall remain here, and choose freely to be queen of my domain," and he extended a hand towards Region. Her tears fell freely as she gazed upon Aethor, and the captain forced himself up from the ground, and met her eyes, and shook his head; but Region closed her eyes and turned away, and ascended the stairs to the throne. And when Lord Caroc's hand closed around hers, the breaking of bones could be heard, but though Region bit through her lip, she made no sound.  "Mercy you asked for, and mercy I will give him." With that Lord Caroc gestured to Kuld, who slipped forward and tangled one hand in Aethor's hair before wrenching him to his knees. A short dagger glistened in the darkness before Kuld plunged it deep into Aethor's gut. Region was still screaming as Aethor's limp body was dragged from the chamber.
Yet outside the bordes of Checle, much was in upheaval. The Caroc wrought destruction over the shattered remains of the free peoples; and those of the Mirien who had survived the War of Red Tears were hunted across all the lands of the West. Destruction was wrought upon the Pelore, who fled to the sea, until at last only Rel Aren held firm against the onslaught.  Prince T
