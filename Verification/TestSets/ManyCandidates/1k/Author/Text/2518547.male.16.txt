So tonight/this morning was Emily's party.  It was a very quaint little party.  Yup.  Nice people.  Nice house.  Good stuff to eat and drink.  We all finally got to see Allison's dress.  Very yummy that dress is.  Indeed.  But she looks good in whatever she wears.  Everyone at that party looked the same as they did a week or so ago.  I got the most unexpected compliment from a certain someone about my eyebrows.  I was like "hmm... wonder what I should say in response to that..." So, I said... well, I don't remember what I said.  I'm now blind in my right eye because I was brutal poked by someone's finger! *cough* someone *cough* Oh, then she...er, I mean "someone", savagely punched me in my stomach! *cough* someone *cough* I'm just gonna think of it like this... "It was all out of love!"  Why that's in quotation marks, I don't know.  I'm most likely going bowling w/ that "someone" and a buncha other people tomorrow night/morning... maybe it's not such a good idea to put bowling balls at her disposal...  So to sum things up:  1.  Emily's party was fun. 2.  I threw a golf ball real far over a lake. 3.  Allison and her dress looked mmm, mmm good together. 4.  Both Johns looked very Johnny. 5.  I didn't expect Dale to be there. 6.  I'm blind in my right eye because of someone's finger. 7.  I'm glad I went to Emily's party. 8.  I hope tomorrow night's/morning's bowling is fun and mostly non-violent.  9.  I'm not sure how to end this list.  The End.
So f'n bored.  No school and no social interaction make Ryan go-something, somethin...  Emily's PT is tomorrow.  Alec's PT is on Friday.  I went to Alec's house yesterday.  Those are the only highlights of my glorious vacation (outside of the virtual world of FFXI).  Speaking of which, I got my White Mage to Lv.25 a few minutes ago!  Yay!  Now I can Raise (aka, Revive) dead people!  I'm a resurrection man forreal!  So the count is Red Mage->Lv.27, Black Mage->Lv.22, and White Mage->Lv.25.  Niiice.  Except now I'm broke... Spells cost $$$.  Lots of it.  ********************  I lost my debate folder...  Everything... Gone.  Poof... Just like that.  I have no idea where it is... Hopefully Ms. Bitters found it.  I can't wait to get back to school and debate more of those bills... Especially one involving the elimination of a certain form of US currency.  ********************  I wish I had something insightful to say here...    ********************  But yeah, Emily's PT is tomorrow night.  Should be fun.  There's a lake outback... Or some I'm told.  I'm gone go fishin' for dead bodies.  Then poke 'em.  Yup...  Maybe we're all gonna get to meet Emily's good-lookin' Brazilian friend.  I wonder if *** is gonna freak out cause *** ****** is there...    I hope John K. goes... We'll have a reunion of the Crisis Buddy Team!   ^^John K., Allison, Ryan C.:  Running from Bomb Threats One Day at a Time.^^  ********************  I wonder if **** is still "angry" at me for "singling him out" on my ****... Weird.  ********************  Word. ********************  Sean (Allison's easily-amused cousin) just left... I wonder if me, Robin, Sean and Allison are ever gonna get together for a game of world domination in Monopopoly (yes, it's misspelled on purpose).  ********************  Alright, Alright, Alright, Alright, Alright, Alright, Alright, Alright! Stop, o, den wiggle wit it.  ********************  I do believe that's all I have for now.  Sleep well knowing that I'm no where near you. ((names were *** for the sake of everyone's wellbeing))
Whoops, better change that...  Again, I don't have much to say today.  I helped Joe out a bit last night... seems he formatted his harddrive when he tried to reinstall Windows XP cause a mouse wasn't cooperating... >  **************  I had a crazy dream... I missed the bus for school and time was goin all fast and sh-t.  I got to school at 9:41AM and was pissed off that I missed first block's debate.  Then in Wilson's class there was a fire on her desk or something... Shivani thought I started it on purpose but Sam said I didn't... and for some reason Nicole (Allison's friend) was there and she ran out to get a fire extingusher... I put the fire out then went out in the hall to put the extingusher back.  For some other reason, I kept trying to put my bookbag (instead of the fire extingusher) back into the fire extingusher holding thingy.  WTF?  I think woke up after that...  **************  There are scary Christmas trees running around the Final Fantasy XI world right now... some really f-cked up stuff... killin everybody in sight. >  **************  I got Simpson's Monopoly for Christmas... we should play sometime.  **************  So far it seems like I DO have a lot to say today...  **************  Man... I wish we could just ditch guns and cannons and go back swords and bows... That'd make war sooo much more interesting... and challenging... and LESS common.  *************   OH MY F'n JESUS!! I just remembered that I LOST my debate folder... 'tis a gloomy day...  Looks like I'm gonna have to speak off the top of my head if I don't find it.  *************  I do believe that's enough for now...    Hope to see you all Monday night!
I had to change my comment hostin' people for the sake of helping Allison get comments on her Blog.  niiice.  Anyway, it seems like "Blogspeak" didn't pay their bills cause their site doesn't work anymore.  So in a way, I guess I HAD to change it.
I DO have something to say today.  I think this originally came from Allison:  "Have you ever wanted to do something just to see how it feels?"  Of course I have!  Today my sister had some of her friends over + Allison's "charming" cousin, Sean.  We were in my grandmother's basement... and I was walking up the stairs... then I suddenly wondered what it'd feel like if I fell down the stairs.  I *almost* tried to f
