I'm so lame that I am philosophising about the lameness of this post and the lameness of this blog. Aren't I lame.  That's so lame.  L-A-M-E. Lame!
If you notice, all my past posts are stupid, particularly this is a stupid blog. If you want a proper but un-updated blog, go to http://www.retrospeck.blogspot.com.  Thank You.  Remember, my name is Jeremy Ho, though I sometimes like to spell my name as jeremi.
if you look up, you will see a banner which is a controversy talked about in many places, including my school forum. Just go to Google search and type: how to remove Blogger banner.
This is a blog I just created just for the fun of reserving a unique url.

A lot of people are saying the previous post is lame.  ?_?  I was not trying to be sarcastic or anything, I really like that model. Pilot is my fav brand for pens, and G-Tec is my fav pen frm Pilot.   RELATED INFO:    Colours user has for G-Tec-C4:  Dark Blue, Green, Red (used for school of course).  Started using:  Primary 5, 11 years old.   Fav highlighter brand:  Stablio (is that how you spell it?)
Argh.  This is the second time Sean has spoilt my pen. My precious  G-Tec-C4  Pilot Pen.  There are two ways a G-Tec pen can spoil. Sean did it the first way. The nib is pshed all the way in, making it hard to write. Another way is that the nib bends about 60 degrees. Either way the quality of the pen is compromised, or the pen is unable to write at all.  And I don't want to throwit away, I'll try to use it till the ink runs out, or I'll feel guily dat I did not preserve nature's resources, and also that I did not preserve my money. Of course I'll be lucky if it cannot work, or I'll have to throw it away without guilt.   FACTFILE: Pilot G-Tec-C4    Length of nib:  0.4mm  Cost:  abt S$3.00 for pen, abt S$2.00 for refill. (simple math shows that the plastic costs abt S$1.00 meaning the plastic is of high quality, in tandem with the high quality ink.)  Ink quality:  High  Type:  Cap  Colours avaliable: Dark Blue, Red, Green, Black, Light Blue, Purple, Pink, + more  User comments:  I am happy as I am able to write very well with it. It is smooth, does not smudge, and can be used for quite a long time. When writing with it, I found myself much neater. However, nib gets easily spoilt, and cap becomes loose after a long time. Try not to drop it a lot of times.  &copyCopyright jeremi.fact

Today I stayed back to practice drill for the Guard of Honour thing for speech day. As usual, Herman was there. Though making us laugh a few times, he did not crack so much jokes this time - you could tell he wanted to get a job done quickly.  This is the first time we practiced with rain - and the first time we practiced that we did not sweat at all.  After the thing some sec2s went to play basketball. I did not get much chances to shoot =( but it was fun anyway. I got quite a few wounds from that game. it was rough, ya, but then my most serious wound came from when I fell and tripped on the tiles while going to get the ball. Abrasion.  Well that was all for that nice afternoon...
hahaz, got to miss school today.  there's this thing called peer group advisor when they pull you in bcos they assume you understand these young crime commiting juveniles better then they do. 2day we got a sample of how it was like in the juvenile court, and well, since it happens in the morning, we missed school. Sad, a history test was postponed.  Ya, and we also had to wear long sleeve white shirts and black long pants - starcy stuff - felt quite formal suddenly.  Other people there include my classmates Lester and Koganti, Darel and Wenhui from 3K, Roderick, senior frm BB and Daniel, fellow squad member, frm BB too. (his surname's Pflug!). Teachers were like Mr Oh and Mrs Raj.  We ate at Macs after that and we wrote our reflections there too.
Just got my gmail account. Been anticipating it and going thru each benefit and begging people for invites...well, i didn't need to. When I got my account today and logged in...well, I did not feel different, or that sense of elan. I was the same before and after.  I feel happy however, after starting to use it.  jeremi.ho@gmail.com
