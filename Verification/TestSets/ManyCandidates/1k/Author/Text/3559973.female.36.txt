Try that:  For at least three days, or better yet for a week, keep close track of how you spend your minutres in:   important and unimportant phone calls,   studying papers,   restudying papers you've already read,   socializing,  planning,  daydreaming,  being interrupted  making significant headway.   Then, figure out where you're wasting your time in relation to your priorities.
Scheduling less important work before more important work.  Starting a job before thinking it through.  Leaving jobs before they are completed.  Doing things that can be delegated to another person.  Doing things that can be delegated to modern equipment.  Doing things that actually aren't a part of your real job.  Keeping too many, too complicated, or overlapping records.  Handling too wide a variety of duties.  Failing to build barriers against interruptions.  Allowing conferences and discussions to wander.  Conducting unnecessary meetings, visits, and/or phone calls.  Chasing trivial data after the main facts are in.  Socializing at great length between tasks.
Two years ago I've started one of the most complex and life changing enterprises of my life: an MBA. Nothing since then left the same: my innerside, my life, my family, my relationships, my job, my perceptions and expectations about myself, loved ones, friends and strangers alike.The very day, the two WTC towers were smashed to the ground. I saw my American colleagues in shock (and not only the Americans ones). I was also but because it was about a carnage not because of all economical repercussions that were to roll over the whole world. It is crazy but I could not see that time any economical or financial implication of that event. I was listening amased forecasts made by professionals or not so professionals, of people who just wanted to have an opinion about it. An alarm bell rang deep inside me! I was not able  at all  to discuss the subject as a business person.  Will I ever be a business person? Will I ever be able to add my own contribution to any organization in a distinctive way? Will I ever be able to manage something and induce positive change? Will I ever be able to taylor the way and lead people along it?  PANIC!!!!  No, I should just breath and calm down!  I definitely have the will, and it is said where is a will there is a way. This log is more than a journal. I want it my tool for building self confidence. There is my sixth sense telling me I can. I can. I love my sixth sense. Seldom get it wrong! I should educate it more!  Back today: today is the Administration Counsel at Group level. The last audit was terrifying for the owner. The bases for a new group structure are to be set. I wonder which will be the criterion for defining the new divisions? Hope this 11th of September to shake the chaos in my company and bring order. I am a dreamer, isn't it?
When thinking on how people perform into their jobs, I came across to two basic categories of people: winners and whiners. After more than ten years spent into the work market landscape, my conclusion is that a simple detail separates people in the mentioned categories: our perspective to a very simple question:
Do you ever feel the need to discuss professional issues and not to have a reliable person to talk to inside your company? Well, I do. Perhaps this is one of the reasons I have started to post here.      Here it is a little clue on how you can build your knowledge-base network:  http://www.linkedin.com  I tried to search for Romanian profiles. There are only 12. Although I do am convinced there are much more people whose perspective would be interesting. Success with your network!        Any ideas of how to put your network at work?
Hello everyone!   First announcement : I was thrilled to see today that I do have my first subscriber. Congratulations, whoever you are! You will not be dissapointed. So... after all... people are interested in such topics!   Second announcement : I just changed the title of my page. I started writing here this  Journey to Selfconfidence  under the sign of insecurity . Today I changed my mind. The new title is  To Whom It May Concern . Is not that I reached a confortable level of selfconfidence. But I just realized that I have first to accept myself with all my downsides to build selfconfidence on it.  So...here we are dear Reader - To Whom It May Concern might be right for you! Enjoy!
Why I ask? Just came from one of my colleague? s office. In the middle of a discussion he wanted to sustain his point and looked for a certain email he got on the subject. His Outlook Inbox was an interminable long list of emails? and in the end he was not able to find anything. Nor to use any advanced Search option. In the middle of the debate, I was for a moment intrigued: he is a Project Manager; in principle, this is what he is supposed to do ? to manage information and internal and external communication channels (well?besides budget, quality and delivery term). That inbox told me something bad about his organizational skills.      And here I am, asking you: how do you organize your mail-box, or your files in your computer? Wait your inputs. Thanks.
I write this for the ones who intend to get a sponsorship for an MBA from their current employer. Lots of people found my Yahoo profile interesting because of this MBA, and asked me how on the Earth I managed to pay for it. It is a reasonable question that I put myself when I was playing with the idea of following such study programme. Still, I suggest that getting money for it is just a milestone, and one should be very much aware of it?s further implications.  Once you graduate an MBA, you want to prove how much you are worthy. You have energy, you have your passed work experience and you look with pride at it, you h
