I've had a great weekend. Haven't blogged in like ages but am back. Anywayz, I went to enchanted kingdon yesterday with Nina, Julienne, Jona, and Franz along with our moms and dads and it was really fun. (LOL-hit me if that was a run-on sentence). Saturday we went to Divisoria-it was allright, stinky but fun. And that day I heard my favorite song-by Lisa Loeb (Stay-I Missed You)3 times!!! LOL. I'm waiting right now in this really cool bookstore just enjoying life.
Ok...I saw this movie 'The Day After Tomorrow.'  It was good, kinda freaky though in a sense that if we do destroy our environment, it could affect us in a way that we can't explain in words. In some cases, we may freeze to death. The weather can just kill us.  So the next time you use styrofoam, don't think "Oh, just one. It won't hurt." The truth is, I believe it can and it will. I love our earth, and we must take care of it. I sure wouldn't want to move to Mars or Venus soon. We are the human beings put on this earth-let us take care of it-all of us, both young and old. The movie, I guess, should convict a lot of people for the actions they may have done in the past, or even now. By the way-totally out of topic-I love Jake Gyllenhaal!   Another part of this not so stressful day-(I am on the go for a stress-free life now that school's over)-Story of: Frankie and Jen  So today Frankie and Jen chilled in the mall..."Hmmm...is there a point to all of this (LOL, inside joke?)," says Jen. "Ummm..." Frankie remarks "I dunno." A really weird conversation is sprung up then between two look-alike (maybe relkatives) people close to us-(listen if you care observe if you don't) Lady 1: So ur son is going to university in England? Lady 2: Yes, in Worcester. He got a full scholarship... Lady 1: I'm happy...he's such a smart boy. Lady1: Yes-but I feel like he's not smart enough. (By this time, Jen is laughing) Lady 2: How can you say that? Lady 1: Because...I feel it. He's a straight-A student, but slacks of and drinks a lot, parties till midnight. I hardly know how he does it... (Ok, Jen stops laughing) As if the conversation wasn't weird enough...Kris, Miko, and Leilana came...nope, just kdding it wasn't weird they just LOOKED weird cuz they had their hair dyed in pink-all three of them. They looked like they could be back up singers for Gwen Stefani.  So..think about it-absorb it LOL just kidding but odd? Take it or leave it.  Peace  And love mother earth.
Well my life doesn't suck for the moment-(hopefully it never will) but I'm pretty tired right now...It's been an okaish day, I guess one of those days when you can go up to ur crush and kiss him madly, passionately on the lips-then leave with a smirk, thinking, I did that. Amigos, amigas, that was not a brag, nor was it pride, it was simply-taking the next step. Of course, most of my pals wouldn't see me doing that-hehe ;P.  But Faith guys may push me away, and go, what the "he** are you thinking!" No-just kidding. Prolly half of the guys in the school really dislike me anywayz-who knows? But as Van would probably tell me, who cares? LOL I want to write a book one day on the significant differences between girls and guys. Besides differences in about EVERYTHING or most things, what else? '"Sometimes I wish I were a leaf flying away, falling asleep". I guess on the emotional side, girlss will feel that. For guys? To takcle the male mind is like going inside a dark room where you're trying to find the switch. When you do find it-you can either like it, find it interesting, or find it empty or boring and leave. Kung puede ko lang isipin yung iniisip nila, well, I guess it'd be easier. Well enough of my guy theories now, I'll prolly end up single and living it up in New York, in a loft with 2 gay guys as my roommates-them teaching me about the world of the gay, and me teaching them the world of the straight! Hehe-lol that would be funny. It's like mixing ice cream and sausages ending up with funny epxressions on your face. But I like to enter the non-conformist, idealistic world. I think my mom would kill me to do so, but I have to find my niche one way or the other in this world.
Got to go so later!!!!
