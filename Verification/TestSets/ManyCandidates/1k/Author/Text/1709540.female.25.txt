i'm in ocean city maryland, a place that elicits a groan from most normal mid-atlantic residents.  actually i find it kind fun.  although i'd find it much more fun if i wasn't stuck in a hotel room with family, who deem it the only answer to the rain--instead of seeing movies, playing indoor golf, walking around with umbrellas.... i mean, it's not like it's a monsoon or blizzard, it's just not good tanning weather.  i'll write more on this later.  unfortunately my usage is being clocked and timed at a little place on 7th and philadelphia avenue (i think) and being the paranoid individual i am, as well as the broke individual i am, i'm going to sign off.    no im here either!  man!  what is the world coming to!?  thank god for text messaging.
well the bust finally came through today... no more IM/MSN messenger for us at work b/c of "complaints" about "chat rooms".  ahhh the lingo of the computer illiterate.   "but officer!  i'm not in a chat room!"  oh well.  i'm not going to argue technicalities with them.   my problem with the situation is this.  my 9-to-5, at times, provides me with more free time than i know how to manage.  thus, messanger is ideal.  plan my night, catch up with friends, less intrusive than yakking on the phone...  and i'm not talking about when there is work.  when i'm on deadline, when i have projects, when i have actual work... any of my IM buddies will tell you that there's an away message posted or better yet, i'm just not on at all, when i actually have work.  even minor amounts of work.  so either give me more to do or quit yer bitchin'!  and there's always email.
so this is my first attempt at this sort of thing.... rather voyeuristic... like screaming out entries from your own diary over the screen in times square... though i don't know how much of an audience i'd have...  i'm 24. i live in washington, d.c., where i grew up... yes i am one of those all-elusive natives.  i am not involved in politics.  i think i'm a writer.

after getting back to the apt late last night, i park in a rush hour spot.  in DC, rush hour spots mean you better move yo' ass during the hours of 7 am and 9:30 am, or 4:30 pm to 7 pm, cuz you'll get towed otherwise.  but so i park there vowing to be up early to move le vehicle.  so at 7:30, after a totally sleepless night, i'm in the shower, and i'm thinking well at least my commute is shorter today.  and then i remember i was supposed to move my car.  i throw on clothes, don't put in contacts, don't comb my hair, and run outside.  my car is not there.  i realize i better start walking to the metro before i'm late to work.    so once at work, with wet hair, no makeup, and sweaty as hell, i call the DMV.  oh yeah, we just moved your car around the block.  apparently this is pretty standard practice.  me, being the idiot that i am, did not know this.  so i grab a cab with my last $7 and go to my car.  there it is!  with a big fatty ticket for towing costs.    so, at least happy that my car hadn't been hurt, stolen, destroyed or further fined, i drive on to work.  some banker-type corporate asshole in a boxter keeps cutting me off and making kissy faces at me.  so i flick him off.  my karma ratings are so low today.  question of the day:  if i need a "sleeping aid," will my health insurance company pay for red wine?
ok, so yesterday i have my weekly dr's appt.  mention to him i'm stressed/anxious and not sleeping all that well.  this can be troubling b/c when i stop sleeping it tends to wind me up into a manic phase.  he gets out his pen to write an rx for a "sleep aid" so i don't go into hyperdrive.  i stop him b/c well past experiences and stuff.  now here's my question:    a) is he the idiot for wanting to prescribe me sleeping pills   or   b) am i the idiot for turning down possibly fun drugs?     (sigh.  sane adulthood is  no  fun.)
well i have no clue as to how i'm still awake right now, but i am.  i'm at work.  it's dull.  i'm feeling better today, i suppose.  making progress on the grad school fiasco, takin' names, planning trips... all with a bank balance of $-163.  go me!  i rule!  and surprisingly i didn't spend any of that on shoes, booze (er, well), or massive quantities of lip gloss tubes from wal-mart.  some  urlLink humor for ya  courtesy of the onion.
ever have the feeling you just want to throw yourself from wall to wall in a room?  like a ball hit perfectly by the cue held by someone with a nonshaky hand?  well too bad i got those shaky hands... still wanna just run and slam myself into things to maybe get it all outta me.  this is why people cut themselves.  to feel, to realize, to come back into their bodies.  i've got the tunnel vision right now, from outside of my head looking into my head thru my eyes, like the being john malkovich sensation.  shit there are somedays that i really wish my meds would work.  you know, there's this whole sensation of "i'm ashamed, oh the stigma", well you know what--FUCK THAT.  you're reading this and maybe you don't know me, or maybe you do.....and i don't care.  maybe this comes as a shock or maybe you knew it all along.  whatever it is, yeah.  mental illness sucks.  yeah i'm on meds for misfiring neurons, and you know what?  i wish the hell they worked right now.  otherwise i'm REALLY going to have a manic monday.  i'm a fully functional individual but i have my bad days (and my too good days).    so deal with i
