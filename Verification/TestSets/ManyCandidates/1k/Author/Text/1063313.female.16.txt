well... as far as teaching him the "right way to treat a girl" thats kinda pointless cause when we are done with him there wont be enough left to teach... but yeah
ok alicia is the beautiful talented girl, and nick is her former boyfriend, thank god, the prick. we all believe including Julie we should go to Clinton Louisiana and show him the right way to treat a girl, after beating the crap out of him and draggin him behind sam's big red van. taht's the story ttyl and ttfn
Well its jus me... jus sayin hi an that we had an awsome time @ the MercyMe & Michael W. Smith concert... everyone shoulda come cause it was awsome... i even made 5 bucks for screamin out "YOU ROCK BABY" 2 the chick who was singin,  patrick dared me 2 an her gave me 5 bucks for it... so i was happy. But then on our way out rodgers got lost... u would think a 10th grader could remember where we parked............. but he was on the other side of the building and was compleatly lost...... we were gonna call him but nobody knew his cell # so we got 2 groups of peeps out lookin for him an we finally found him... i was thinkin he got mugged or somethin cool but he was just lost :-( well i gotta go... cause i can smell spaghettii... and its like one of my favorite foods an knowin my family they will start eatin w/o me and that would really suck cause if i dont get in there fast i wont get 3rds or 4ths... so luv ya'll an ttyl
who in the heck are yall talkin about? and what the heck is a prick??
i'm helpless, blonde, and confused.
and that isnt a good combination. lol
cya
<33 ashleee
Yeah well i offered to beat the crap outa a stupid prick and she said no... prolly a good thing cause knowin my sence of direction i'd get the wrong town and beat up the wrong dude
it's amazing how a beautiful talented girl thinks she needs to change just for the people around her, I wish guys wouldn't take advantage of girls like that, no one deserves to be treated that way, especially someone like that. God help me if she doesn't come to her senses and stop listening to stupid pricks
Well................ i am done with 2 pages now................ only have 3 to go whoopie!! and i really dont care if patrick can sing or not... i just want more guys 2 come so i can quit being the only tenor
haaaaa i got my hair cut!! it's sooo short.. lol.. seriously.. really short.. and sam! the report is due TOMORROW! so if i were you, i'd stop singin an write the report, lol.. yeah josh r! you need to come to choir!! .. but.. uh.. patrick?? can he sing?? i mean.. not to be mean.. but.. patrick.. in the choir.. lol.. that's kinda hard to picture.. lol.. but we do need guys.. i guess..
so anyways.. i'm off to do stupid alg II.. which was assigned from the dude that sniffs markers!!! ON DRUG AWARENESS WEEK! or w/e it's called.. lol that's funny..
okay buhbye :)
<33 Ashley
