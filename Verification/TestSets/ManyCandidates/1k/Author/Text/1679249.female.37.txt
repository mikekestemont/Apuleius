Bob Patterson  will be Shutterline's Photo of the Day judge for roughly the next three months (minus a week here or there)... Continue to send your POTD entries to the same email address. Good luck, Bob!
Photo of the Day for Feb. 16, 2003 --   The Lady in Red      Photographer:  Margaret Schmidt  Comments:  A photo I've been playing with trying to get that old time portrait look with a charcoal look...  Camera used:  Canon D60  Geo. location:   Bob's comments:  Well, this is my first choice for POTD and boy o boy was it a difficult choice or what?  There are some SUPERB submissions, really there are.   How you guys maintain your standards day in and day out, I really don't know.  In the end, my choice was The Lady In Red - there's a sort of mystery about her that's simply beguiling.
"The photos suck."  No, the Photo of the Day winners are great actually, but some of you have expressed honest concern about the image quality being shown here. Starting with the next POTD winner published (on 2/16), the image you see here will be just a "thumbnail" -- you click on it to view the full-size image. I am sorry that I haven't been doing that yet, it's still a new system for me but I think it will be cool to have all of the POTD winners for the week on this one page. Then, you can just click on the image if you're interested in seeing it at the highest resolution. Cool?
Photo of the Day for Feb. 15, 2003 --  A Moment of Beauty      Photographer:  Deborah Walmsley  Comments:  There are so many beautiful sunset's here in Idaho, and I've often tried capturing their beauty, but always from my front yard.  On this evening, we hurried out on a venture looking for a new and better location to capture this sunset.  The area we found in this photo is in Eagle, Idaho.  This was a very special day, and was important to me to photograph this sunset, as it was my dear Mother's Birthday.  Camera used:  Sony Cybershot  Geo. location:  Idaho  David's comments:  Great sunset shot, Deborah -- I've seen plenty of them in the past, they get boring after a while, but the rich tones and the interesting foreground sets this one apart and makes it unique. A deserving win!  (by the way, I really enjoyed a few of the other entries received today, will roll some over to the next day's contest!)
Photo of the Day for Feb. 14, 2003 --  Comfy      Photographer:  Jim Carper  Comments:  This shot was taken at Animal Kingdom at Walt Disney World on Feb 8, 2003 using a Canon EOS D30.  Camera used:  Canon EOS D30  Geo. location:  Florida  David's comments:  Great wildlife photograph, Jim! The pose and framing of this image is excellent as well. Just to let everyone know, POTD entries are still being accepted at the same email address (shutterlinephotos AT yahoo dot com) and a link to submit photographs is also available within the  Premium Member Control Panel . Don't stop sending your daily entry just because you haven't won in a while -- be persistent and continue to take creative shots!
Photo of the Day for Feb. 13, 2003 --  Ruffled Feathers      Photographer:  J. Pedersen  Comments:  Not the zoo this time, Sea World.  LOL  Camera used:  Sony DSC F707  Geo. location:  California  David's comments:  Good coloration in the background and an excellent subject. Now I know how Cheryl feels, it is ridiculously difficult to pick the winner of these contests... We had another animal entry that was awesome as well, in addition to some great landscape shots. If only we could have two winners a day (hmm...)
Great! The upgrade to the  Photo of the Day  service was successful...  Now you can view each daily winner from this page. I think that will make things easier. Also, I think that we  all  need to give a huge thanks to  Cheryl Meisel  for being our POTD judge up until now for over a year. That's awesome, and she has done a tremendous amount of work to help Shutterline get to where it is today.  (come back here every 24 hours to view the latest winning photo, starting on 2/13)
Photo of the Day for Saturday, Feb.22nd, 2003 --  Wolves    urlLink     Photographer:  Mariette Geest  Comments:  by luck I could make a picture of these wolves. those eyes....  Camera used:  Olympus C-730 UZ  Judge's comments:  I think Mariette says it all - it's the eyes, the eyes!   This is the first thumbnail POTD that we've tried.  You should be able to click on it and be taken to Mariette's fullsize submission
Photo of the Day for Friday, Feb. 21st 2003 --  Lamp      Photographer:  Lyn Winans  Comments:  None ...   Camera used:  Olympus 2020  Geo. location:  Minden, ON  Judge's comments:  The contrasting colours in Lyn's picture are outstanding.  It's a lovely study.   Not being a gardener of any description - well I mow a mean lawn! - what I'd really like to know is what sort of flower it is !
Photo of the Day for Feb. 20, 2003 --  Down to the Waterline      Photographer:  Jum Carper  Comments:  There's a little spot where some shrimpboats dock in Mayport that makes a nice backdrop for various birds flying by, including various herons, egrets, osprey, and of course, plenty of brown pelicans.  Date  19th February 2003  Camera used:  Canon EOS D30  Geo. location:  Mayport, Florida  Judge's comments:  The Bird Man of Florida does it again!  Amongst some truly superb entries for POTD, Jim's brilliant capture stood out.  I've no idea Jim, quite how you manage these shots.  The way I see it is that the birds see you coming and just start queueing up to pose for your camera because they know they'll be a POTD
