8.17.04 – Seeley G. Mudd Hall, University of Southern California 	It’s our second day of training preparation.  Yesterday went pretty well.  It was a bit drawn out.  The work we actually had to accomplish could have been done in about 4 hours instead of the 8, but that’s just me complaining probably.  The other incoming students pleasantly surprised me, as most seem to be quite normal people as well as chemists.  I think I’ll be just fine in their company.  I was my usual charming self to these new compatriots, and I believe that most of them at least found me mildly entertaining and tolerable.  What can I say, I’m intoxicating.    	I should probably get going because the flock is starting to come together for training again today.  (I arrived early today.  The train was really flying.)  Today we have some TA training.  We are running a sample lab.  I am sure I will feel very judged on my chemistry and laboratory skills.  I did my best to over prepare last night though.  I spent three hours studying the lab I’m doing today.  We were only supposed to read through it, I think, but I made sure to research the background theory behind it.  Better to overachieve early to know what I can get away with later.  I’m such a dork. … Later that same night, 	I’ve been calling my apartment “The Work in Progress”.  Looking around it is easy to see why.  I plan to eventually get seating, internet, gas for my stove.  All the luxuries in life, but right now I have none of these things.  I’ll get there. 	I throw this out now more as a teaser than anything.  I can’t really elaborate at this point because I know my mom reads this blog every once in a while, but if you’re curious email me.  Last night I had a situation arise.  It was one of those things that seem to happen to only me.  I don’t know how, but I always find myself in the oddest situations.  I’m not really complaining because it really keeps my life interesting. 	If you’re really curious about what my life is like, I’ll let you know right now.  These days I get up fairly early to get ready to go up to USC via train and bicycle.  I spend the day there doing some sorts of training.  I’ve enjoyed the first few days.  The company is nice and the work is something I really enjoy doing.  Then I come back home and pretty much find ways to fill my time until I can go to bed.  I know I could go to bed at anytime because I don’t really have anywhere else to be, but I still can’t really let myself go to bed much before 10.  I gotta play it cool.  At night I like to watch scrambled Olympic coverage on my TV.  It doesn’t come in very clearly with my rabbit ear antennae, but they only come around once every four years, so I take in anything Olympic that I can…  What the hell am I talking about?  I started out talking about my normal day and ended in a discussions about my love for the Olympics.   I love Michael Phelps.   I’m determined to work harder than pretty much anyone else in my incoming first year graduate class.  I spent much, if not all, of my night last night preparing way more than I ever had to.  But I’d rather know I overworked than to learn too late that I didn’t work hard enough. I should go to bed.  I’ve been drinking some beer to put me to sleep.
Kiah is at USC.  I'm in some type of student center.  I think USC has several different types although I'm not really certain of what each of them is for or if I'm even at the right one.  I'm assuming that I can be here.  I went to the previously described informal lunch of death.  It really wasn't all that bad.  Maybe because not that many people showed up.  But hey, what do I have to do with my time that is more deserving.  Nothing, that's what.      After the lunch I got showed my new desk.  How exciting.  Nothing like being crammed in a space with a few other people.  But I am grateful for the space.  Then I got roped into a meeting.  It was fine, but I wasn't ready for it.. I'm running out of time on this computer, gotta go.
Here's the thing.  Although many will argue otherwise, I don't really like dating.  It's hard, awkward, and generally unpleasant.  Now many of you that know me well will say that I do it a lot for someone who doesn't really like dating.  True enough.  But I date more out of necessity than desire.  I like being comfortable with someone and having a relationship with them, but getting to that point most often requires some form of "dating".  Both parties have to get all dolled up to impress the other.  We have to look nice, but not too formal.  One wouldn't want to scare the other party into thinking one is a stiff.    I guess I could deal with the dressing up part.  I like dressing and clothing in general, but what really gets me about dating is the smalltalk.  I'm not good at it.  When I first meet someone I can honestly say that one of the first things that goes through my head is not, "Good lord, this girl is so hot.  I just gotta know what her favorite movie is..."  But that's what people do to fill the gaping holes in conversation that can't yet be filled with relavent information.  I can't really talk about the kind of progress I made on one of my Xbox games on the first date, for example.  I have to talk about what kind of work I've done, schooling I've completed, my family.  Now all of these things are important granted, but a telling someone I'm a chemist is not r
