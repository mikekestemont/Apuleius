Well Strike Me Pink! - as Kel's dad would say! I've spent the last 3 hours on this thing @ the very least! However, I have now got comments, some links, AND I've changed the  urlLink colours ... getting fancy now!
Salutations!  Welcome to.. My Blog! In Tab terms, this is a big and courageous step, so... got lots to learn but I hope u like it! Actually I don't care if u don't like it, cus it's meant to be about me, and what I think, but I hope that u can appreciate it 4 being me; if that makes sense. That's all.
Deu 6:6-9 (6)  Never forget these commands that I am giving you today.(7) Teach them to your children. Repeat them when you are at home and when you are away, when you are resting and when you are working.(8)  Tie them on your arms and wear them on your foreheads as a reminder.(9)  Write them on the doorposts of your houses and on your gates.    K, well this is something that I think is pretty important, basically cus God does. The generations to come are critical!  urlLink Tim Hawkins  said that  the Christian Church is always only one generation away from withering and dying.  This means that if we don't reach  every  generation they will pretty much, be stuffed.  What I've been doing for the last 2 days has been (kind of) to do with this. I recently became aware of a group in the Wendouree Community called  urlLink Strengthening Generations  whose aim is to improve life for the young people and families in the Wendouree and also Sebas/Delacombe area. What they do is based on a plan/program called  urlLink Communities that Care . This is a secular organisation, who don't acknowledege God in any way, however, they  are  doing the work that God called us to do (James 1:27) Basically (this is what I've learned @ the workshop training these past 2 days) what they do is once a community is assessed as being ready for change, this program begins, first by setting up Community Action groups, then surveying the school population in the area to find the areas of Critical Risk for the Young People, and also the protective factors that are in place to prevent the Damaging Behaviors. Then where we are up to now is about analyzing the data (it's in a report, so we don't have to crunch the numbers- thank God!) to assess where our community needs action. It's a huge plan, very long reaching, and it's going to take a lot of work. After we've done this stage the next one is to identify the relevant service providers in the community and see how they can work together, become more effective, and to bring to attention the areas that are missing. It's all very exciting! The  urlLink results  in the USA & UK speak for themselves...
Did you know, that according to Yolande, Uni lowers your IT? Apparently that's what happens after a day of uni, you can't tell the difference between a Q and a T. Kind of ironic...
My soul is allegedly worth Â£70679. Given that the exchange rate is currently 2.3999, then my soul is apparently worth $169,625.56Aus. The interesting thing is that God thought my soul was worth more than that...
I had a fantastic weekend in Melbourne with Adam and Ruth who moved there 9 months ago so Adam could go to  urlLink  Tabor . I caught the train to Melbourne, & on the way listened to Christine Caine talk about evangelism, and why we should care. Pretty challenging. Anyway, we spent the night eating donuts, mmmm..... and playing  urlLink  scrabble . You would neva guess, but I won! Scores were Adam:144, Ruth:139, Tab:164.    Saturday  We window shopped @ Chadstone - and spent no money (amazing) 'cept for going to urlLink  Gloria Jeans  - who sell coffee not jeans, and we bought pretzels @ Eastland which I found out were not little biscuit thingies covered in salt, but kind of a dough. Yummmmm! In the evening Jodie came around and we watched  urlLink Maid in Manhattan  - I wasn't too impressed with it - it was  not dirty at least, but then again it wasn't really  anything  but trite. Oh well.   Sunday  Ruth & I went to the 11am service @  urlLink Crossway  which was about moving on from traditionalism and the stuff that tends to kill our faith & turn it into a dead religion. Very inspiring stuff. That evening we all watched  urlLink Australian Idol  - my first time - and I have to say that I was enamored with Guy. What talent! He's listed on the  urlLink Planetshakers  website, photo and all, as a singer for "the band". Nice! Can you imagine! Australian Idol @ PlanetShakers.... again.... Nice! I really hope that if he does win, or get a record deal or whateva that he uses it as a platform to spread the  urlLink gospel  .  What an opportunity!   Monday  Well, I kinda slept all morning cus I was up 'til 2am finishing  urlLink my assignment  4 Youth Ministry 2 @  urlLink Harvest Bible College . It is a book review of Leaders who will Last by  urlLink Tim Hawkins - he's a dude.  This is a link to a  urlLink review  done by sumone else, and I'll try to get a link to  urlLink my review  on the links @ the side of this page! Neways, we drove around a bit in the arvo then I caught the train back to Ballarat.  I have 2 say that I was unaware of how much I missed being away from my friends and the usual stuff we do Friday-Monday. So I was extremely glad 2 see everyone!    Well, my day didn't end there (tho it should have) cus John's internet wasn't working, cus his housemate hadn't bought more hours ( they should go  urlLink T
