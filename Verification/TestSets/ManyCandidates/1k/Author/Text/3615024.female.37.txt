I am planning an "intervention" on Thursday or Friday afternoon...  Hawk thinks that keeping me in the dark is a form of control. (yes, I know, it is...) But I am going to take things into my own hands this time, by meeting him at his house when he gets off work. He has told me before to be more aggressive in my insistence that he is "mine"... So I guess I will. He is going to have to talk to me this way... Im his submissive, not his doormat. I refuse to be ignored.
There are a lot of changes coming for me. For one, no more obsessing about Hawk. If he calls he calls, and if not, fine.  Two, I am emptying my house of everything that I do not love or find useful. Even my furniture. My slightly worn modern furniture goes to my ex-husband. All the knick knacks that have no meaning to me get picked over by my sister, daughter, and mother, then into the garage sale they go. The same with books. (gasp!!) All the books I bought when I was trying so hard to be the perfect Christian wife and mother sit on my bookshelf giving me guilt trips every time I walk by... All those that I did not write personal notes in go into the garage sale, the others into the trash. I will fill those emptied shelves with books that really mean something to me. My dark wood antique bedroom set that my grandparents got me at an auction, while not my style, remains in my bedroom out of reverence to my grandparents, who were the only people on earth to show me unconditional love, but... I am going to paint it a lighter color. The dark is depressing, but the 4-poster bed may come in handy some day...;-) I have a dining room table that has a smoky grey glass top that I love... But a tacky gold metal stand underneath that I do NOT love... I will find just the right thing to replace it... My living room will go without furniture until I find just the right pieces. My bookshelf waits for just the right books. My walls for just the right art. Nothing that I do not love..
Tried to call Hawk again... nothing but the answering machine...again... I have seen him sit in his chair,  and when the phone rings, he will look at the caller ID and not answer... I just never thought he'd do that to me...
Amazingly enough, I have a 3 day weekend coming up. This is also Hawk's weekend off. IF I can even get a hold of him, this may be the perfect weekend to talk things out. He is so exhausted every evening by the time he pulls that truck down the driveway at his farm every evening, all he is usually thinking about is food, a shower, and out like a light by 9 pm.  His mind works on about 6 tracks at once, but all those tracks stay in his own little world most of the time. I guess I'm just not a big enough part of it to attract very much attention. In other news... I think I must have a sign on my forehead saying "Fruitloops Welcome" all the Fruitloops here in "Hick" County Kansas are constantly trying to talk me into going out with them. They hang out in the store, and won't take no for an answer. There is no way to insult these guys, either. They think you are kidding and laugh it off. Last night it was Marty. Pretty nice guy, kinda cute, intelligence level stuck in the 6th grade. Still sleeps with his ex, along with all the other men in the county. He constantly bitches about the way she treats him, and the other men she sleeps with, and then, in the same breath, tries to get me to have sex with him in the back room. Seems to be obsessed with me tying him up. Boy, is he barking up the wrong tree with that one. LOL   Sometimes its Victor, cocky, kinda cute, thinks he is God's gift to women. Spent more time in prison and jail than anyone I know: DUI, domestic abuse, drugs, beating up a cop... You name it, he's probably done it. Real winner. Rides a bike, because he has no driver's license.   Then there is his brother, Bill, who told me the other day (with a wink) that he was going to stop my and see me one of these days... And I thought, sure, bring your wife with you....LOL Such good pickin's in the single market of Hick County Kansas. How did I get so far off track from where I wanted my life to be?? I was never going to get married, never have kids. I was going to go to college and get two degrees, Journalism, and some type of Art... Instead, I started dating a very sweet, submissive, man, and when he asked me to marry him, I panicked and married him, thinking if I didn't catch this one, I might be alone f
