Everybody Everybody! Give  urlLink thegreengrape  mucho props for a great recording session yesterday. She gave me permission to share some of it, so, grab some decent headphones or turn up those kickin' speakers and click  urlLink HERE !   And  urlLink HERE's  some of the lovely "tango sounding piece!"
I can't win. I killed the flowers I planted while Nadine was gone. They're in the flowerboxes on the front of our house. But only one side is dead. Go figure. Anyway, come to find out, she wanted petunias anyway.
Well, I thought Michael Moore handled himself well on The O'Reilly Factor tonight. Better than Al Franken would have... I was actually more impressed with Ben Affleck at the beginning of the program. He really came across well, and I like the fact that O'Reilly gave him props for being well-informed and well-spoken. Moore and O'Reilly wasted too much time arguing over semantics, and it was obvious neither was going to back down. That's fine though. At least Moore finally appeared on the program. And they eventually agreed to disagree, and ended with a handshake.  Now, I'm going to warn everyone... If it's not obvious already, I'm a bit of a news/politics junkie. Just don't hate me because I'd consider myself a "moderate conservative," if I had to pick a label. That just happens to be where my values and opinions are at the moment. I realize it may not be "cool" to align myself with the republican party or President Bush, but I challenge anyone to examine your own core values and ideals. This is a deeply divided country, but I don't think it needs to be. There will always be extremes on the right or the left. It's ok to be in the middle somewhere. If you're not cool with the politics or news posts, just ignore them. I'll try to post other stuff, too. I'm still cool, and I think you are too... Seriously.  We began watching Amazing Race from the beginning tonight. It's Nadine's favorite show. I'm falling asleep at my laptop. Came to a moment ago to find several hundred o's chasing each other across this post. Must... go... sleep...
Wake the kids, phone the neighbors, hang on to your wigs and keys, get ready for the fireworks...  urlLink Michael Moore  is on  urlLink O'Reilly  tonight!

My favorite show on TV these days, automatically  urlLink Tivo 'd for me nightly:  urlLink Dennis Miller , M-F, 9pm/12am, CNBC, "featuring reasoned discourse, opinion and humor." Oh, and a chimp, too...    From  urlLink an interview  with  urlLink  The Weekly Standard  :   "I don't think of myself as a classic conservative," says Miller. "I think of myself as a  urlLink pragmatist . And these days, pragmatism falls into the conservative camp. We have to depend on ourselves in this country right now because we can't depend on anyone else. We are simultaneously the most loved, hated, feared, and respected nation on this planet.
Yay! My wife comes home tomorrow! No more anti-social hermit behavior, gotta finish cleaning the house. Three weeks is too long to be alone. Yeah yeah, I played with the dogs and stuff, but the cat will definitely be happy when Mommy's home. Daddy just doesn't give her as much attention as she wants. Yuck, it looks weird typing "Mommy" and "Daddy" but I guess that's how we talk, so yeah, we're a little dorky like that. At least no plans for human children anytime soon. Ok that also looks weird. Doesn't preclude alien children I guess.
Took my doggies to the vet last week, and Zulu had a pretty bad ear infection,but I've got drops for his ear, and he's feeling a lot better already.
Aaaaaargh! Stuck in a staff meeting since 8:15.... It's now 11:05. Glad I have my laptop and wireless and the power cord, cause my batteries would be dead by now. Problem is, everyone else in this meeting keeps talking circles around the same subjects. And frankly, we're wasting time discussing most of it.
I recently updated my homepage at  http://aboutthenelsons.com . I hope to update what's there, and maybe add some more goodies (pictures most likely) soon.  Oh by the way,  urlLink DirecTV DVR  rocks!

go  urlLink South Africa !    from the  urlLink Mail &amp; Guardian Online :   South Africa's golden boys led Olympic news in Greece and the United States after Roland Schoeman, Lyndon Ferns, Darian Townsend and Ryk Neethling broke the world 4x100m relay record for gold in the biggest upset of the Athens Olympics so far.  "South Africa's relay men cause upset of the Olympic Games," crowed the Olympic early-morning update on national Greek TV station Alpha. The station showed the entire relay, then focused on the jubilation of the foursome at the edge of the pool where Ferns, who turned 21 last month, stood on the block flexing his muscles and waving the South African flag.
