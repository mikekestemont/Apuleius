Oh my God. Sometimes that's all I got to say when I get to this place. She's wearing a simple beige strapless dress with dangerous heels. That would be Savannah. She adjusts it as she walks away. Holy crap. Now I've got a crick in my neck.  So begins tonight's talent report. It's taking me a moment to scan the rest of the girls because I keep looking up and she's still walking around. It's like a tunnel vision. OK, she's behind the bar. Vision clears.  There's Luan. I've seen this dress before, and it was one that she wore one evening that was identical to Savannah's. It's clingy black with white lace on the shoulders and for little flaps on the bottom at the front and back. It draws the eye in all the right directions and there's that crick again. And now Savannah's back just standing in front of me, posing, hip jutting, teasing the fella's at the table across the way before she hands over the checker board, or whatever it is they play here. OK. She just went behind the bar again, so I should be able to refocus and find Tee.  I saw Tee out of the corner of my eye a minute ago, there. Tee, no glasses tonight, and dark eye makeup. A sultry look for her, as she's usually bouncy and bright. I can see the changes since she's been here, learning the ropes, picking it up in the outfit department. In the beginning you could see the struggle to find something to wear to fit in. The real difference between this place and the few others like it that I've occasioned, is that these girls dress like women, not girls. She's in black, and she's done something with her short hair, kinda wild. It's good. The dress has straps tied behind her neck, and there is a small v cut into the top in front. Some Spanish style frills at the back adding some appreciated volume to the back yard, a little flouncy something to follow around with the old eyeballs. I now spy Tina sitting behind the bar with Savannah. It looks like white from here. I'll have to wait a minute or two for full disclosure.  Minute's up. Tina can't wear a bad thing, and she's not. It's a white top with spaghetti straps paired with a light blue and white print skirt. Very feminine. Pretty. Ruffles in the same material on the bottom. Long thin stems stolen from a couple of champagne glasses. I'm hipmotyzed. But Savannah wins. Hands down. Tonight.  It's nice that tonight has been such a special effort for my entertainment, because, folks, this will be the last bulletin from the front lines for at least a week. I'm heading out of town, and though it will be a good trip, it will be that much less, because I can't take this place with me. No wireless. Not even broadband. No coffee banana shakes. No rocket fuel doped coffee. No big screen Laker games. And no insanely hot Vietnamese girls serving me tea. I'm bringing my own smokes so I won't go bankrupt buying them there, but I can smoke damn near anywhere, for the moment, which is the last redeeming value of the land called Jersey. I would weep, but I don't want my view distorted until I have to drive home.   It looks like the evil Sack-o-tomatoes Kings are losing to the Bucks. Yes! Time to check the standings. All right. If the Lakers can win tomorrow without Kobe, the Kings are beatable for first place. Not likely, but second place is for sure not out of reach. If the Lakers finish strong it should shake the Kings up just enough to make them easier to kill, especially if the whole wrecking crew is healthy, or at least out of jail for the showdown. Back when I first heard about the new lineup last year, I laughed out loud for days. This wasn't fair to the other teams. Who could have predicted the wacky meltdown that includes Kobe facing life in prison? I know, I know, anybody who's been watching for more than two seasons. But really, it's nutty, no?   Ciao for Niao.
I have been pondering the wisdom of linking to my other blog. Yesterday I did it in a post. Now I'm going to put it on the blogroll. The two blogs are pretty different, this one being the more fun and silly of the two, at least that was the plan. But, what the fuck, sometimes things happen that I can't keep my mouth shut about. So just like Glenn Reynolds does, and that fellow Lileks, I'm linking to the other place that nobody reads and I don't get paid for.  Talent report: (Even though I'm actually waiting for Ed to get here so we can go get some chow). It's Tee working the glasses. It's white night and she's got the high collar blouse on as well as Farm Girl, who took my order tonight for the first time ever. I had to ask her to wipe the crap off the table though so it wouldn't get all over the laptop. Luan the sweet came over and made the same hand motion that I made to Farm Girl, smiled, and set me up. I heart Luan. Savannah, Miss Vietnam is in tonight looking smashing as is the no longer mysterious youngster. I found out the other night while sitting at the bar and eavesdropping that spring break is coming up, which means we get to see more of her. Um, more meaning more of the time. She's still a 'good girl,' and her family comes to pick her up after her shift, which ends long before the place closes.  The Lakers are playing the Bucks and the game is pretty close at the half. Savannah just told me that she wants pasta. It's all about the pasta. It looks like I'm going to squeeze Ed to go get Italian tonight. I d
