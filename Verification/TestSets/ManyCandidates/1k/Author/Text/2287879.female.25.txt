"Groove is in the heart..."   Is potentially the best song ever. Dee Light rocks. She's turned up full blast at work. The same work where the ladies in payroll, who are my moms away from mom, tell me it sounds like I'm listening to reggae everytime they come back to my little office (which isn't really an office, but there is no cubicle, thank God). Really I'm listening to some lame soft rock station that's on some satanic continuous loop of five pop songs. It's maddening, yet I don't dare mess with the already fickle reception.   No management in the house results in donuts, music and the girls in staffing dancing to a Christmas song at their desks. It's mid-November. Too early for this.    The Onion  calendar on my desk says "Tearful Hitler Promises to 'Give Peace a Chance.'" Whatever.   I'm just happy it's Friday and I have a ripe banana.
God's Camcorder   Last interview of the day, 180 degrees from yesterday:  I should've known interviewing Michael was going to be interesting. When I asked him if he knew his name in Hebrew meant "One Like God?" he answered he did, and "I ain't God." When asked to tell me something interesting about himself that wasn't on his application, Mike said, "I can't split water neither."   So off to a biblical start, we pushed onward.   Come to find out, Michael has a pesky habit of videotaping past supervisors sleeping on the job. Smart move if you do the same thing, which Michael did.   I asked Michael if he could leave his camcorder home if we sent him on assignment.   He just smiled.
This month's favorite writer writes:    "...Grief ends up giving you the two best things: softness and illumination."  Anne Lamott,  Traveling Mercies: Some Thoughts on Faith   These two best things were in quiet abundance in my last interview of the day.   L. was initially stoic, almost grumpy. Long face, long blonde hair. She's a delivery driver. Has been for the past 9 years. She didn't volunteer much information. I didn't want to hear myself talk. So I sat still, took a deep breath and asked her how she found herself delivery driving.  "My husband." He died two years ago. Together for 20. She sat still after volunteering this. "I lost 13 family members that year." I changed the subject to her past employment reincarnation as a seamstress. I couldn't handle 13 loved ones gone. 730 days is not that long. I kept wondering how 13 people die in one year, but I didn't ask.   Instead, I asked her how to make a quilt. Seemed like a safer question. Patience, she said. It takes lots of patience to make a quilt.   And persistence.   Those two things will get you through it all, she said.   I'm still not convinced I can make a quilt.
Things not to tell a potential employer...  *You have several warrants out for your arrest. They are not for traffic tickets. Good news: They are not felonies.  *"My wife is always getting me in trouble." Read: Assault & battery charges for abusing said troublesome wife. Um, who's getting who in trouble?  *You haven't worked in the past 11 years. You've hopped from friend's couch to friend's couch making wooden incense burners for a living. You see nothing wrong with this artistic wandering. Today, though, you're ready to "make a life" and get a job.   Best long-term goal of yesterday's interviewees:  *To do web development for Heart or Van Halen. I think the timing's off, but the idea's interesting. Maybe she could bring some incense burners for her rock-and-roll idols.  Worst person to get stuck behind while rushing to work:  *Lou, the 80-something telemarketer for a neighboring attorney in this office complex who square dances with married men at the American Legion, likes to tell dirty jokes when I'm covering the phones and brakes through green lights.
On Saturday at a knitting-cool friend's finger-food party a guitar-playing, Beatles-loving friend suggested I do this. I scrunched up my face and then asked why. "It'd be interesting." I assured him it would not. What would I write about?   Your life.   Too broad.   What about others' lives, I ask? I'm better at that...other people's lives.  ***  I interview the unemployed at a staffing agency. I meet characters everyday. People don't believe my stories about the administrative assistant who brokered an art sale to the Louvre or the professional bull rider from Mexico who wants a packing job or the breast puller from a major poultry plant who doesn't laugh at his job title. Pulling chickens apart is tough, nasty work.  I sit across the table from jobseekers everyday and I learn something new. I learn that I have two degrees that mean squat. I learn that until now I haven't taken any true steps for working for myself.   I learn that I want to share this because maybe it's not so uninteresting after all.
Thursday I survived a flu-like haze, surrounded by used tissues and Good Earth Original tea bags. I am alive!  I can kind of breath. My left nostril runs consistently. Why? I do not know. My doctor should tell me today at 1:30 p.m.  I am one of those co-workers other co-workers curse. I come to work sick.   I shot myself in the foot yesterday by referring a really cool, super talented lady to a job I've applied for (yes, I would like to trade temporary wisdom for family literacy wisdom). She'll get the job, this woman. She's had over 20 years in literacy and a Masters.   But I felt good about telling her. I felt like there's a reason people's paths intersect somedays. I'm new-agey like that.
Courtney Love Gone Corporate   I have a cold. Blogger advises (generally anyone writing about their workplace) me not lose my job over this. I agree.   So let me explain my intentions.   I write about the people I meet/interview not to mock them, but to describe who/what I deal with on a daily basis. I'm in shock that I'm fortunate enough to meet the characters who are r
