I am just going to start by saying that today I went to get my first spray on tan. Actually, it is pretty much my first tan of any kind. I don't tan. I burn. People have called me everything from pasty to porcelain-skinned.( i prefer "milky")  I am just friggin' WHITE. In every sense of the word. I have a flat ass, a boring white name and a voice that borders on whiny valley girl. So i am tan now. I also smell funny, kinda like warm olive oil. It's Italian tonight dear! There are parts of me that look bruised and others that are steaky. maybe I didn't do it right. I bet that most folks who do this already have some color, so these imperfections don't show up. It's suppsed to take another 4-6 hours for the color to fully develop. I'll let you know what happens.  I am kind of excited and kind of not. If it works out really well and I love it, then I'll have another way to spend money I don't have. It's like $30 a pop and they say you have to go back every week or so. Maybe I'll just do it once a month and deal with the interim pale-ness.  My pal is responsible for your reading this nonsense. She's a full-on blogger-chick and felt it was necessary to bring me into the Land of Blog.  I am happy about it though a bit nervous.  One reason i am happy about this is my days at my job can be very slow and I have been looking for an outlet to keep me occupied. On the other hand:What if no one reads my blog? Or worse, what if I am just boring?  I bet someone will tell me if that is the case.  I have been keeping a diary since the third grade and I am trying to get all of the diaries in one place so I can begin transcribing them - I have a far-off idea that I might try to publish them someday, if no other reason than it is almost a full account of my entire life.  That's gotta be interesting in some way.  I think I'll have to wait a bit longer to publish my more recent diaries though. I don't know if I want everyone to know everything about my whirl-wind single days - yet. Maybe I'll discuss that here. Plus, I still have a lot of living to do. IF (that's a big if) I did actually get published and went ahead and released all of the diaries and IF I became famous for it, wouldn't that completely change my life in a way? I would not longer be able to write from the standpoint of the regular Joe. I'd be famous and shit would be all fancy and new.  Not only that, but how self-less would it be of me to wait until I died to publish. Then it truly would be a nearly complete life story, lacking only the years prior to the third grade.    Thoughts anyone?  Last, I am now single again. Yup, doing the divorce thing after only 8 months of marriage. In my eyes it's more like only 3 months because we separated January 3rd (married September 7th, 2003) and it was pretty much over then. It sucks. I've been in a vortex between not ever really being married and now not quite yet divorced. And I just found out that i won't have the satisfaction of a court hearing. Apparently only the plaintiff meets with a court clerk who then makes it official. (this is because it is an uncontested divorce - we had nothing to split except the wedding presents)  I guess I just wanted closure and I thought hearing some slightly overbearing divorce judge ask if the marriage is beyond reconciliation and then both of us (I will refer to my ex as CB) would tearfully answer "Yes" and then the judge would say something official-sounding like, "I now pronounce you exhusband and exwife" and it would be done. I feel I must explain that it was actually MY divorce, but CB filed the paperwork and therefore became the plaintiff and I became the defendant. eventhough it's really the other way around. I'm gonna stop for now. See what happens
So yeah, not much of a virgin, though perhaps always room for new things.  I am going to see what this actually looks like before I continue. yah.
Dim-Dam Chris left a message on my work voicemail with his new phone number "in case you need to reach me."  Damn! I want to post that number on here so BAD!!  I wanna, but I won't.

Accept that you have a duty to participate in events, as much as you'd like to slip away. Stay involved, but get ready to take a chance to get away from it all, which should be coming up soon. Find quiet ways to amuse yourself."
I am not doing very well today at all. I am anxiety-ridden and overwhelmed. I don't want to deal with anyone or anything. I am on the verge of just bawling and my boss was just being a total bitch to me over the phone because she fucked up and isn't here right now for a meeting that she fucking scheduled. Fuck
This weekend and yesterday in particular was weird. Bad weird and weird weird. Saturday I managed to get not one single thing accomplished aside from working out for an hour with roar(notlion). My inner thighs hurt now. Well, JM and I also made an appearance at Atlanta PRIDE. We bought a couple tallboys of beer though it was a somewhat sad experience because apparently Miller Lite was eked out as being THE gay beer. Our only choices were Molson and Silver B
