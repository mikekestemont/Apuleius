Getting quite addicted to writing these damn things, god knows why as so far they are boring as hell!!  Speaking of addiction, it's a funny thing, eh? (perhaps not if you're a recovering alcoholic, etcetera, but you get what I mean...) My addictions include: Texting, eating vast quantities of icecream&strawberries, listening to music, speaking 2 people, reading, etcetera etcetera.   Addiction- i define it as needing something, and suffering from some sort of withdrawal symptoms if you are deprived of it (and yes, I get that with all of the above!!) My small banana-covered dictionary (I'm damned if I'm disturbing the precariously balanced books in my smallest bookcase to get the huge one out...) defines addiction as "the condition of being abnormally dependent on some habit." Excuse me -   abnormally??   I may be abnormal in many ways, but i defend the rights of addicts everywhere (at least, those whose habits do not excessively cause harm to others!! Like smokers    So must go, STILL got some packing to do!
Anyone who has not heard the song "Play Me" by Neil Diamond should make sure that they do. In my opinion it is v v good!!  Alternating between Neil Diamond, Dean Martin, Doo Wop, Bob Dylan, Elvis, Maroon 5, Scissor Sisters and Daniel Bedingfield at the moment. Cesca says tis&nbsp;a strange habit that I have developed, saying what music (or mucis as Sloth would say...) I am listening to. Well... I am a strange person!! heehee.  Donchya hate it when you write a blog then discover u'v made an&nbsp;error, whole editing process, ARGH...  Hey Mr Tambourine Man...    ANYWAY. Off 2 Shrewsbury for a week tomorro, having evaded the family holiday, which luckily Mum has accepted as not being a personal insult. Just couldn't take the arguments right now- my brother, believe it or not, has reached new levels of obnoxiousness. I know sibling troubles are present in every family, and the youngest is always a pain when growing up, but I don't think anyone could understand how bad he is unless they tried living with him. Honestly, he's a monster. Excrutiating pain to Miles indeed. For some reason no-one can grasp, he apparently weed on the outside wall yesterday, so now no-one can go outside til it's been hosed down and disinfected. I swear, he's a fricking lunatic, I don't know how that happened, being part of OUR family...  Kentucky Woman...  Well STILL haven't packed, which can't be good, as I am going tomorrow &nbsp;:-0&nbsp;&nbsp; Even my parents have packed and they're not going til Saturday. Oh dear. But I do so hate 2 pack... Packing is for wonderfully organised, capable and laid back people, such as Caroline. Messy, disorganised, stressy people like myself should never be allowed near a suitcase, or bag of any kind... Perhaps I should be kept in a padded cell!!! Or not... Mite be a tad boring.  Paddocks, I've always thought that was a nice word, but having said which I must go, until l8r- tea calls.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
Thought I'd try a different font for a change... I love fiddling with fonts, and if there's one complaint I have with these blogs it's that there's very little choice of font and they're all boring!!   &nbsp;  Anyway...  &nbsp;  King Arthur! Happens to be one of my favourite legends (although I prefer still more the way the Pythons take it off in The Holy Grail, sooo funny... The intelligent, political proletariat - "Hey, we're a democracy [or whatever they said!] Just cause some watery tart handed you a sword..." heehee! Going off on a bit off a tangent there but that's what Monty Python does to you... Lot of ellipses today. Anyway, how DARE they use this legend as ANOTHER film made purely to carry Keira Knightley!? If you've seen Pirates of the Carribbean - which had the one redeeming quality of a wonderful, hilarious, eyeliner (but not lipgloss!:-( ) wearing Johnny Depp (actually that one redeeming feature led me 2 c the film more times than I'd care to admit...) who looked particularly excellent contrasted against the wooden "acting" (pah!!!) of Orlando Bloom  , and Keira Knightley, whose acting "talent" seems to consist of pouting when scared, pouting when angry, pouting when in luurve, etcetera, you'll know what I'm talking about.  &nbsp;  Bit of a rant there, tis true...  &nbsp;  Been on a long, long walk with my silliest dog and my mum, my feet are blistered!!  &nbsp;  Must go, tea awaits on the table... May write again later on my return, but for now, adieu!
I hear you scream.        &nbsp;   For instance, one of my friends goes on and off guys - well, celebrities&nbsp;- every five minutes. One minute she's ranting about Duncan from Blue (yes did i mention she also has bad taste in men!!) and the next, she's certain that she and some footballer Christiano or sumthing are meant 4 each other.        &nbsp;   My friend whom i have been talking to is fickle withr real life guys. Cesca and I have observed the way she flirts like hell with one guy, then loses him as soon as she is sure of his liking her&nbsp; - the thrill seems 2 be in the chase. With my open mind as ever,&nbsp;(again, ha!) I must add, well, each to their own. However, when the "hobby" affects and hurts others, I object.   &nbsp;   Anyway enough of my ranting on that topic - I'll rant on another instead!!   &nbsp;   Having just returned from the doctor's I am not in such an amazing mood as now at cesca's next week I will have&nbsp;2 take 5 tablets&nbsp;a day, all @ different times :-( not fun.       &nbsp;   ah well better go I'm getting a headache and my fickle "friend" has gone.       &nbsp;   Farewell til once again I grow bored...
Lunchtime blogging, what a giveaway to the sad state of affairs today! Having watched 2 dvds already today i am loath 2 watch another, so instead I am writing this while listening to my mother and brother play table tennis and make odd comments to one another.         &nbsp;     A
