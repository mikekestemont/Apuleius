Sully argues that the  urlLink lib media picked on Jack Ryan's 'consensual adult sex'  and decried it as another rape of privacy. But the point was that  urlLink it wasn't consensual . Per Jeri 'Smokin' Cyborg/Too Hot Teacher' Ryan:   On three trips, one to New Orleans, one to New York, and one to Paris, Respondent [Jack Ryan] insisted that I go to sex clubs with him. They were long weekends, supposed "romantic" getaways. ... The clubs in New York and Paris were explicit sex clubs. Respondent had done research. Respondent took me to two clubs in New York during the day. One club I refused to go in. It had mattresses in cubicles. The other club he insisted I go to. ... It was a bizarre club with cages, whips and other apparatus hanging from the ceiling. Respondent wanted me to have sex with him there, with another couple watching. I refused. Respondent asked me to perform a sexual activity upon him, and he specifically asked other people to watch. I was very upset. We left the club, and Respondent apologized, said that I was right and that he would never insist I go to a club again. He promised it was out of his system. Then during a trip to Paris, he took me to a sex club in Paris, without telling me where we were going. I told him I thought it was out of his system. I told him he had promised me we would never go. People were having sex everywhere. I cried, I was physically ill. Respondent became very upset with me, and said it was not a "turn on" for me to cry.   I honestly don't know where Sully takes offence. He previously argued that  urlLink one difference between Clinton and Arnold  was that the former's transgressions were already in the public domain (via lawsuits). Jack and Jeri Ryan's divorce proceedings were a public artefact, although one that was under court seal.  Ultimately, I'm not sure of where exactly the defining line is regarding public officials' privacy. I still believe that Clinton's offences were execrable, but Republican efforts to abuse the special prosecutor's office to partisan effect were equally, if not more, dangerous.  urlLink Arnold's case is slightly muddier , since none of the allegations made it to court, though the women claimed, not implausibly, that bringing the then-highest paid action star in the planet to the docket was a futile task. Now, Arnold did apologise where Clinton did not. Fine. And he didn't commit these acts as a public servant--and more specifically did not use public services for private gain. OK. But the allegations still sound serious enough that even after the fact should have been investigated.  Ryan's case wasn't investigated as a crime, but as a civil procedure, which puts him somewhere between Clinton and Schwarzenegger. Moreover, the events happened during a marriage, and the revelation at divorce proceedings, where emotions do run high. (See also Blair Hull's downfall, though that involved allegations of physical abuse.) But this doesn't exculpate Ryan if they're true. Did they render him unfit for office? That's a big question. Should we plumb about people's personal histories to determine that? That's a bigger question, and one I'll probably return to later.
Not so much  urlLink for whom David Bernstein at Volokh dot com praises , but for whom he derides.
Many are wondering what the hell is up with John McCain.  One minute he's  urlLink praising  the Democrats then the next, he's  urlLink strongly going out  for Bush. Why all this ups and downs? Sure, McCain is probably being a geniune politician no doubt.. but I think there is more than that. I think McCain still harbors dreams of being President and he's seeing his opening.  McCain realizes that while he could defeat Bush in 2004, by joining up with Kerry, he'd still have to be Kerry's VP (and chances are if Kerry wins in 2004, he won't be making a comeback in 2008.but that's for a later blog).  McCain also realizes that Kerry may well not need him to defeat Bush...Kerry may do it on his own as the stealth candidate as  urlLink Morris  puts it. I bet.. that McCain thinks this:  1).  if Kerry wins, I can run in 2008 (sure I'll be 72 but Reagan wasn't that far in age from me and I'm still in great health).  I'll run as a uniter after 4 years of Kerry pissing off Republicans. I'll say that Americans earn for a uniting leader as they did with Ronald Reagan and I'm the guy that can do it.  I'm a loyal republican who fought hard for Bush in 2004, but I'm also someone that Democrats loved so much that they wanted me as their running mate.    2). If Bush wins, he will have ended up polarizing so much of the electorate that Jeb Bush will have a tough time winning the nomination.  Frist and the others won't excite the independent and Republican base like me.  And I also get a chance to get a bit even with the  urlLink Bushies for their behavior in SC in 2000.     McCain is a smart man.and though he'll be old (he'll be 80 when his two-terms are done if he were elected in 2008) but being 80 is getting a wholle new meaning.    Get those bumperstickers ready..McCain/Guiliani 2008!!
This is  urlLink patently fradulent and mendacious prosecution .
Oxblog's David Adesnik posted Saturday that it would be scary if the terrorists who had decapitated Paul Johnson, Danny Pearl and, maybe soon, the Korean hostage  urlLink learned to simply release their prisoners . That way, they demonstrate their moral superiority to the infidel westerners.  But this strikes me as based on a false premise. Without exception, these terrorist groups' Wahabbist beliefs compel them into an apocalyptic mindset where they can take no quarter and must achieve absolute victory. To cede any mercy would violate their particular interpretation of the Qu'aran.  Moreover, showing mercy wouldn't benefit their cause. Presumably, the majority of the Muslims whose support the terrorists want t
