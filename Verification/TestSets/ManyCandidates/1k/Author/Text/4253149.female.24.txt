I was one of those little girls who used to practice writing my first name paired with the last name of the cute boy who sat at the back of the class. I remember especially at the height of my crush on a guy, I would write it over and over in my notebook. Or if I liked more than one guy I would write my name with each of the their last names to see which one I preferred. But those days of pre-fem(inist) bliss are long gone and laughable given my passionately defiant views about relationship gender dynamics in this culture.  I am opposed to the patriarchal naming system that honors male heritage and identity and invalidates the female's. I am repulsed by the symbolic statment that the female perpetually belongs to the male- first her father then her husband.  I think the decision to take on your husband's name, hyphenate, or keep your own is an important and personal one. I don't judge anyone who has taken on her husband's name- the fem movement, afterall, advocates a woman's right to choose, whatever her choice.  But for me, I have nooooo plans WhatSoEver of dropping my last name. None. Zilch. Zip.  First of all, my family is the most essential aspect of my identity and my name ties me to them. My family is a very small, tight crew and I don't want us to ever be divided even in name. Further than that, I want to pass my family name on to my children and have them pass it on to their children. My family is a strong, courageous female group whose legacy I want to see carried on in name and story.  It's also important to me because of the particular dynamics of the relationship that I'm in. My partner and I are from two completely different cultures, and where I have a stronger connection to my cultural roots, he comes from a much bigger family. One side of his family alone is 10 times the size of my family. So, as much as I hate to admit it, there is somewhat of an issue of cultural threat.  I come from a small Jamaican family (my mother, father, and older sister immigrated, my younger sister and I were born here). My culture is a fundamental feature of my identity, second only to my family and it's very important to me that the future generations of my family maintain a connection to their Caribbean heritage. Growing up, my culture richly colored my environment: Jamaican neighborhoods, Jamaican churches, Jamaican family friends, Jamaican food, Jamaican music, Jamaican cultural values, and best of all frequent visits to our family in Jamaica. I LOVE Jamaica, the land and the legacy. My heart takes a leap just talking about it.  I have American friends, however, who don't know what their family's country of origin was (I'm speaking of those whose ancestors were  voluntary  immigrants). They're fine with it, and that's good for them, but for me the thought of my children's children being detached from the our culture is unbearable. Our culture is just too precious to me.  My boyfriend's family is Italian American, and incidentally so is my boyfriend. They are several generations removed from the original immigrants in their family, but their Italian heritage is largely present.  I think it's beautiful that my children will enjoy two rich cultural heritages. My boyfriend and I are already planning ways to give our children a strong sense of identity to both cultures, including trips to Jamaica and Italy- and I don't mean the tourist spots. Well maybe in Italy, but I've never even been to the tourist area of Jamaica and I'm not even curious about it. I know that it's not the Jamaica I know. I think of it as Jamaica on stage performing for a foreign audience, but the parts of Jamaica I go to are the true heart and soul of the island, it's the raw and beautiful existence behind the curtain.  I hope we can make similar connections in Italy as well. I've always adored the culture.  While I am optimistic about bringing the cultures together, for our children, I worry about how easily their Jamaican identity can be overwhelmed by their Italian one. Although I don't have an indentifiably Jamaican name (bcuz no such name exists- well, maybe Marley), my boyfriend has an unmistakably Italian one. Between an Italian last name, and a large Italian family, I might as well ship my kids off to Italy and call it a day. I want my family to have as much prominence in their lives, their daily lives, as their Italian family, and having them claim my family name is an important way to maintain that balance.  So I've made the case for keeping my last name, but there are some problems with that as well. First, we're going to have to take a lot of slack for that, from society as well as our more tradiational loved ones. As if being an interracial couple isn't trouble enough (with regard to others, not us), do I really want to pick up another battle?  Second, and perhaps most importantly, that little girl who used to doodle her notebook pages away?...She's still in there..... And I can't help it, there's something I find truly and utterly romantic and loving about sharing a last name with your partner. It's just..why can't it be mine??? In our case, I know the answers to that. First, he also has strong emotional and cultural connections to his family name. Also as an artist, name recognition is important to his trade. His name is beautiful, too, from the first, middle to last, it's perfect and I could never ask him to alter it. But as tempting as it feels from time to time, I can't alter mine either, for reasons that are equally compelling.  Oh, darn the feminist movement for waking us up to our rights and choices.
The other day I was at the doctor's- well t
