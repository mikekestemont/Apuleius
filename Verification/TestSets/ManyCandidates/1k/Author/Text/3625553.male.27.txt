man ive been working. if not the lawn, or the kids, or the car, or the fucking lawn mower, its been actual paying work, which im guessing is good. still looking for a job in the prattville / montgomery area, but im thinking about other places as well, dallas, austin, south carolina, atlanta, who knows. anywhere is good right about now.   Alot of my ghost team is now working on a game title for a company over in germany, really cool, going to be in the crytek engine. Crytek is a great fucking engine, but man farcry blew, i hope its better than that. that had to do with the game though, so im hoping they pull it off, i cant wait. they are looking for a game producer as well, i would love to take that position, and prolly could, just with the fam and a starting game company with enough funding for a year, not a good mix, not for me or the company. Relocation to germany is cool though, i loved it the three years i went over. Kids would love it, but like i siad, just cant do it.  Blogger is getting a workover soon i hope, im still trying to think of a good design, and looking into some other options for it. it seems alot of the bloggers that are heavily customized are movabletype bloggers, but i really like the blogger interface,and the ease of it, so i think i will stick with it for now, and just customize what i can for it. i would be nice if they started giving you more choices to implement stuff like calenders, search options, etc.  more later on.
ill prolly be redesigning the blog in the next couple days. problem is, i really like the layout, ill prolly change the top, and a couple other changes, and go with that. As far as updates, nothing really, my mom might be moving to dallas, if that happens, ill prolly not going to be to far behind her..so we will see how the next couple monthes go.
it wont stop raining down here for god sakes.  My lawn mower was broken and i didnt get to the lawn for two weeks, now its supposed to rain for the next 5 days, and my lawn looks like something off the discovery channel. its amazing really. so now im sitting here, with my parents lawn mower, and waiting to mow the lawn again, under the watchful eye of my elderly neighbors. they evidently watched the news, and took care of business before the storm.  fuck em. :)
as quick as i got my invites, they are gone. I hope everyone is happy with it, i am most certainly happy with it. as far as other news, i found an animator for ghost finally, yay!. con artist seems very nice, and has a very professional manner about him. i hope that this works out well, we will get the game out very soon. i will post more later.
I have 5 gmail invites, if you want any, holla at me at illogicmindz@gmaildotcom. other than that, ive just been hanging out, work has picked up some more, so ive actually been working, lets hope it continues.
Was sitting here eating my pudding, and the age old question came up, wtf is tapioca. one of those things you always think about, but never "google". so anyways, i did,and i get this:   Tapioca is basically a root starch derived from the cassava, or yuca plant. It's often used to thicken soups and sweeten the flavor of baked goods, and it makes a dandy pudding. Budi Acid Jaya, a tapioca starch producer in Indonesia, uses processed cassava roots to make raw materials for crackers, toothpaste, paper, and textiles. Visit the site for an overview of the starch production process. It involves lots of heat and water.  We suggest you don't try making your own tapioca at home. Cassava roots have traces of cyanide in them! The ever resourceful Mayans figured out how to extract this poison for their blow darts, leaving the uncontaminated roots free for eating.    ok this is all well and good, but you still not telling me what the little clear things are, swimming around in my pudding dammit. i need to know these things. anyways, as usual, if you have answers, send em to me at illogicmindz@gmaildotcom.
umm there was a < in there that shouldnt have been. no clue how that got there, but i have launched an investigation to figure out, where exactly in the chain of command things went wrong. ill get back to you if they find anything. /me shuffles paperwork.
its hot as hell down here, and the most anyone can do is look for the nearest water source and jump in. even the water is hot, it doesnt do any good, but yet we keep going. im guessing its better than not going. Ive been working some, and looking for a job has slowed down, i figured, if i dont have a job during the summer take advantage of it, it may be the only time in your life that this happens. anyways, im prolly going to be doing the same thing again, ill talk more when i get back.  **This is the message i sent to the email blogger a couple days ago. its since been returned twice, and was set to retry for 4 more days. When it posted, it had breaks, and screwed the body all up. im guessing the email blogger has some work to be done. :)
i had six to give out, and they are all gone. family, friends, etc. i had siz, which i did suspect, dont know how long ive had them, im guessing i didnt notice the bright red, "invite friends to google mail" in the corner till now. i cant wait to get more, and get more friends online. I see that some people are selling them, man some people will do anything for a buck. I refuse to do something like that, w
