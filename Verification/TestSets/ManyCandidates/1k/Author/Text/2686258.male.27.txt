The Devil made it sweet    ***WARNING***   This is a Rant!   ***WARNING***   I don't really believe  the devil made sugar .  But I do believe that man is stupid enough to get addicted to it like any other drug.  In researching diet and exercise, what I discovered really surprised me.  I've always known I was addicted to sugar... but when I started "laying off the sweets" as they say, I found myself addicted to other stuff, namely bread, and bread products.  That being pasta, crackers, chips and especially... well.. bread.  What I didn't realize is the amount of sugar that is in bread.  And after further scrutiny, I discovered that sugar is in everything that comes in a package.  Discovering that, to me, was like being in a horror movie.  It's not bad enough the boogie man is in your closet, now he's everywhere you turn.    It turns out, that back in the 70's Oceanspray... the people that make cranberry juice(...mmm... cranberry juice) started putting  High-fructose corn-syrup   in their 100% natural juice.  Their profit margin went through the fucking roof.  Why?  Because the number one government subsidized cash-crop in America is... corn! They make the stuff and get paid to make the stuff.  On TOP of getting paid to SELL the stuff!  It's so cheap that thats almost exclusively what is farmed in a lot of places, because they can't lose money on it.  They of course sell it, but then it gets turned into corn-syrup and then... replaces sugar in almost all products.  Even most products that don't need it, because if a quarter of the materials used to make your product is nearly cost free, you'd be stupid not to use it.  So it's in EVERYTHING!!!    And that is what's making  EVERYONE  fat.  That's what did it to me, I guarantee it.  Well... that... and not exercising enough to combat the fat my body was producing.  The thing is, for me, there was no way of escaping it, especially since I didnt know what IT was.  I tried to follow the diets, they say eat low-fat.  Well, do you know how they get low-fat  low   fat?  They add SUGAR, so the low fat doesn't taste like cardboard.  I tried eating yogurts, and slim-fast and granola bars.  They've all got SUGAR in them.  No escape.  Try it some time.  Go to the grocery store and walk down each isle and just SEE if you can find a box of something that doesn't have  High-fructose corn-syrup  in it!  You can't.  It doesn't exist anymore.  And you can damn well believe it's the same in 99% of all fast food.  I'm not even going to try to talk about  cokes .  Anyways, I don't know the answer.  All I can tell you is what I've been doing.  I think cooking real food has been the real key to changing my lfe.  When you finally start to understand the cause of unhealthy eating, and the causes of your addictions, it's easier to start to change.  Look carefully at what you're eating, you may not have noticed that 99% of every packaged, processed and fast food is made with  High-fructose corn-syrup .  So now when I go to the grocery store, the only things I can get without that, are raw meats, raw fruits and vegetables and... well, that's it.  Nothing that comes in a box or a bag.  No hamburger helper, no frozen dinners and most of all... no eating out.  But that's not the end all, be all of this whole thing.  I think man is made to enjoy good foods, and sweets and stuff.  But it comes with moderation.  I'm trying to exercise more than the foods that I take in.  Which means, that at some point, when I hit my target weight, I can eat whatever I want as long as I keep exercising enough to counteract that.  But until I get to that weight, I have to take in considerably less and be much more careful with what I eat.  So it's mostly meats, raw vegetables, little bread and lots of water.  But thats me.  Sorry about the rant.  Not that anyones paying attention.     --Will
What I've lost and what I've gained.   This is not a normal post.  This is mostly an update for myself about my workout and diet.  So it will prolly bore anyone else reading this to tears.  So skip on to the next days entry unless you're either trying to lose weight yourself, or you're interested in my weight loss or.. well.. you're  weird.   This is the last day of my first month of working out.  I figure this is a good opportunity to do a status check.  So far since I started lifting weights I've lost a total of ZERO pounds.  Zilch, nada.  It's a little discouraging, but I'll take it.  I started my diet about 4 months ago and in the first 3 months I lost about 20 pounds.  That all stopped the minute I started exercising.  But oh well.  The workout plan said the  first month there would not be a lot of change, because I'm actually replacing fat with muscle.  Month one is mostly about building a base of muscles to work with, building endurance and reinforcing the habit of working out.  Month two is all about shocking the muscles with heavier weights and building mass.      Overall I think I've done pretty good.  I've only skipped two workouts this month and both of those I made up the very next day.  I've also slowly started adding in aerobic/cardio workouts.  This week I actually went swimming 3 days instead of 2, and each of those were for 1 - 1 1/2 hours instead of the 45 min I started with earlier in the month.  I also went walking one day this week.  My sister and I are going to try swimming 5 days next week.  I think that will make a HUGE difference in everything.  But of course, this week was the first time that swimming actually felt like a workout.  It's taken m
