The boys were rained out for all games today and will have to play at least 3 tomorrow, weather permitting. I guess Lyle didn't love us enough to put pictures on the blog so he didn't see that Jackson's toes were supposed to be crossed. That's okay cuz I have Megan's crossed for tomorrow. I just explained that as the next youngest it was her duty. And as soon as Erika gets home and fulfills her motherly duties she could uncross them. On a good note the boys did get to go to the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame. So that was definitely a plus to not playing. Our house is still in Dodger mourning. We have lost 4 of our favorite household players, Paul Lo Duca (Whose first major league game Adam and I attended), Juan Encarnacion (whose autograph Adam just got last week), Dave Roberts and Guillermo Mota. Although we acquired Brad Penny, Hee Sop Choi and Chuck Finley, our team will never be the same.
If at first you dont succeed try try again.  I dont know what happened to this post and I cant remember word for word what I wrote, but here is the gist of it.  Adam called and said they walked 4000 miles in the opening ceremonies, he didnt realize that as an athelete you are in the openeing parade not sitting on your bottom watching  it.  He took some pictures, so again I will need that tutorial shortly.  He is worried about not being able to play because of the thunderstorms you midwesterners are allowing to happen, so Jackson has to cross all his toes on one foot for good weather and the ones on the other foot for good games for his favorite boy cousin.  He saw Aaron Carter and was in teenage boy heaven with making fun of him w9ith his friends.  RThe rain started before Little Richard could begin his performance so he missed out on that (he would have liked that one).  No sign of W.  and let's keep it that way!  I just checked Yahoo weather and it is cloudy but 82 in CLeveland, sounds like soup.  hot and humid, eeww!  They havent posted any results.  The last game for today should be over about 6pm Eastern TIme.  On a side note, I think I ruined Adams day yesterday when I told him about the MASSIVE trade the Dodgers made of 3 of his favorite players.  I really dislike Frank  McCourt.
I just got a call from Adam, they've arrived in Cleveland safe and sound.&nbsp; They are attending ( feasting  is how he put it) a reception for all atheletes before they go to their dorms.&nbsp; Kathy sent her digital camera with him, so sometime between now and Tuesday when he gets home, Erika or Gretchen will have to teach me how to post pictures.&nbsp; If you want to keep track of the games, I think they will be posting scores and info on the website  urlLink http://www.childrens-games.org/ &nbsp; (Erika it made it a link automatically on the PC)&nbsp;
Well, I didnt get the job.  They "chose" someone whose department is being dissapated.  It really is a let down, this is one I really wanted.  I hate when they interview for show.  I know there are laws and union contracts and you have to interview everyone eligible, but those of us who understand that you would prefer someone or you have to place someone should be told ahead of time so we dont get our hopes up!  AArrgghh!  It is just frustrating.  So my next move is to put my resume out to the real world again.  I hate to leave the district, great beneifts and vacations and all but I also will hate to lose 2 months worth of pay.  On a happy note.  Adam has his reservation for Cleveland, the boys are all flying together on Thursday morning.  After an hour and a half layover in Nashville they should arrive in Cleveland about 9pm.  The opening ceremonies are on Friday with Aaron Carter singing the National Anthem (Megan doesnt understand why Adam isnt thrilled) and President Bush making an appearance.  Truthfully I would feel safer if he just stayed as far away as possible.    Yesterday was pretty uneventful, laundry all day before the cruisers return and take over the machines.  Then practice for Adam.  When we arrived at 5pm someone asked the coach what time to come back and pick up his kid.  The reply was "DARK".  Well at this time of year that can be anywhere from 7:30 - 9:30 so us girls went to the movies.  We picked up Kayla on the way and went to see Cinderella Story.  WHile not a bad movie, it is not something I would have seen if not for Megan (age 12) and Kayla (age 9).  But is was air conditioned (quite cool actually) and dark and quiet so all in all it was very relaxing.
Today was a busy day.&nbsp; I took Mel, Meg and Adam to Universal Studios.&nbsp; I don't know how much they liked it because the only roller coaster had a 60 minute wait and they chose not to wait that long.&nbsp; I however had fun seeing all the different shows and going on the tram ride through the back lot.&nbsp; At one point near the end of the day Adam is playing a basketball game and Megan says to me can I go over to the water?&nbsp; Sure I reply thinking nothing of it.&nbsp; Next thing I know Megan is soaking wet from running through the squirting water fountains!&nbsp; Of course this was right before we were planning to elave, so not wanting her wet jeans on the seat of my car, we buy her a new outfit to put on.&nbsp; Now, amusement parks don't really sell "outfits" per se but they do sell alot of pajamas and since wearing your pajamas in public is perfectly acceptable in LA thats what she wore.&nbsp;   The kids opted not to have dinner at Hard Rock Cafe at C
