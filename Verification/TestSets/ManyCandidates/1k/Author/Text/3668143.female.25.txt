I have this bad habit of only praying so hard when I need to ask a favor from Him. So last night, I prayed hard (well it is a combination of talking, telling stories, self realization, and praying). In doing so I was able to look and analyze all the things that are currently happening to me, my family and my close friends, and the situations that we are all in. I prayed harder and I realized that all these things that are happening are also my omens (whether intentional or non-intentional). I am not saying that it all happened just for me, I am not that self-centered! What I am saying is that, looking at all the things that are happening, it had made me realize one thing: to always be prepared.  And, just like a sign from God, the power turned off for 3 seconds and was back on again. And being my chicken-shit scared self, I rushed to find my phone because darn I am soooooooo afraid of the dark!  The power went back on and I am so glad. More glad that I think I got what He wanted to tell me. I am such a lucky girl.
I don't think I will ever be rich (but I won't be poor too I swear!). A lot of times I ask myself what would really make me happy -- be free from debts and be financially stable, be in a position where I could help family and friends, be in a position so that I could travel and enjoy life -- BUT WAIT, doesn't that mean I have to be rich to do all that??!  When I say rich I meant someone who's really rich. What I wanted is to just be in a good financial position. But I can never say anything final -- because a person is never contented. Perhaps when I reach that point, I would want more, and fail to see that it is what I wanted before.  And that will be the day when I look back and re-read this blog.
I can only imagine how super worried a mother would feel if her son/daughter would be sick and away from her. I don't think it would be easy to be a mother in the future! Just recently, my "girlfriend" in Taiwan got sick and I was soooo worried about her I think I got sick too hahaha (just kidding, I think I got the flu from my Ninang whom I recently visited who's also been recently down with the flu). But yeah I can only think of how much worse a mother would feel if she learns one of her children is sick. I remember when I was still living at the business district away from my family, I would not tell my mom whenever I got fever or flu, because I know that she would get so worried and would just ask me to come back home.
At about 12 hours ago, I was so happy to finally talk again to my sweetie-pie. She said something about how things are naturally falling into their places, that perhaps things were happening as they were supposed to happen.  "Maktub" (yes from that book "The Alchemist") -- "It is written".  Perhaps things are happening the way they are supposed to happen -- like how slow the HK company was in getting me here (and so I still have time to: 1. Earn more money 2. Visit 美雪 in Taiwan first before going to HK! 3. Learn more things like how naturally bad people are so I don't just trust and be extra nice to strangers and be abused by co-workers in HK.  Perhaps the reason why I could not find my passport earlier before going to HK for that interview is because something bad would have happened if I had left earlier.  I had this feeling, maybe since I was 14 or 16, that probably everything has been written already. Sometimes I get strong feelings that things would happen like how I feel they would happen. And even the real bad thing that happened to me, perhaps it was meant to happen to me. It is creepy but the good thing is that we don't know what was written and what is going to happen next. Perhaps this would explain ESP, fortune telling, etc, etc, etc. Because everything is already written. And when I say "written" it goes beyond our basic comprehension of the word "written". I do not know exactly how it is "written" but all I know is that it is "written", and being written as we live what has been "written" (awww golly chicken and egg problem).  And, it is written too that I should go to sleep now. ;p   ===== Chinese notes:  它被寫 (ta bei4 xie3)  "It is written"  我有這種感覺 (wo3 you3 zhe4 zhong3 gan3 jue2)  "I have this feeling"  我現在應該去睡覺 (wo3 xian4zai4 ying1gai1 qu4 shui4jiao4) "I now ought to go (to) sleep"  雞和蛋問題 (ji1 he2 dan4 wen4ti) "Chicken and Egg problem"  原因 (yuan2yin1)  (The) Reason  並且原因是您 (bing4 qie3 yuan2yin1 shi4 ni) "and the reason is you" (hihihi)
I have this special talent of being able to play and really get along with kids. Kids from 3 years and up are some of the people that I get along really well ;p Perhaps because I am also such a kiddo myself! I enjoy talking to them and seeing how they think, how they act and react, and it makes me happy. I play with them well too. The things I do (play dead, act like a kid) they really appreciate and they are able to approach me and talk to me.  Just like today, my godson (is this the correct term?), 3 years old, and his brother (2 years) spent the whole afternoon at our house playing with me. They are so fun to be with and play with!  I think that it is good for me to have a "kid-therapy" from time to time (that is, play with kids).
