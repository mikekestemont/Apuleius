First... sorry for all the spelling mistakes i made in the last one, ughhh... even i found the mistakes... I'm almost there, i fixed the problem, I was happy!!! everything was fine, i'm becoming good at this, but when i was thinking everything was fine, another problem appear, now is not giving me the reports from the 26 to the 25 of the month is giving them from the first to the 30... WHY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!????????????? i dunno... how am i going to fix this... i dunno... For today i'm done... my headache start already, i just came back from the Shrine (i pray for my mom and sister)(i forgot to pray about this...!...)anyways, lets see what happen tomorrow, by the way tomorrow i have to give my report to Finance department... !!!!!!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaahhhh!!! i'm going to relax now... maybe tomorrow is working normal again, anyways, i'm almost finish... i can give the report by just adding the hours, i have solved the major problem... i'm fine, i'm cool...
Why i hate TimeLog... well, have you ever worked in a position that you are not trained for??? WELL if you have.. welcome to my club! i don't have to complain... i have learned a lot since i came, and i came because i wanted and it was one of the dreams of my life... so i'm not complaining... this is service... this is good... i'm not complaining...  not , ok? Well sinse i came i have done looots of things, some lots of fun some not that fun... i have worked in the gardens (the most beautiful ones) as a gardener (fun)i have driven trucks (fun) i have driven Vans everyday for 2 hours (fun & not that fun) i have cleaned bathrooms (!) i have cleaned breakrooms (?!?!) i have cleaned yards, tables, chairs, windows, offices... i have washed uniforms, boots, raingairs, more uniforms, clothes from extrangers (including underwear) cars, plants... i have deal with gardeners from all over the world (fun! sometimes) mainly arabs (not that fun) i have attend them, i have given them their uniforms, i have done their finance, i have deal with their money, i have pay them, i have took them to the hospital, to the restaurant to their homes, i have, cured them... etc... etc, etc, etc an a million of etc... But the thing that has presented the most big challenge and headaches is this  PROGRAM of hell!  called  TimeLog the friend manager  (friend manager for your grandma!!!) why?? you may ask... ok. let me explain...  Everything began, here in the Gardens of Bahji, in Akka Israel... i work here as an administrative assistant... well, i'm in charge of doing the account (ME THAT I CAN NOT FIND THE NUMBER 2 IN THE CALCULATOR) well i'm in charge of adding the time of hours they have worked per month (that begins every 26 and ends on the 25 of the next month... just to make it a bit more complicate) and after a long extrange and complicate process, were i have to check the 100 different contracts for each one of them, add the over time that is just added after 43 hours worked per week, but if they haven worked the 43 hours, but they have worked in a non working day it does'nt count, sometimes, but it does another times... i check their applications per vacations, and holydays, that considering that you have around 5 official religions in Israel each one takes different holydays so i have to check each one of theirs but some of the holydays are according to the lunar calendar, wich means that each year is in a different date, and some days they are allow to leave 2 ours before for some of the holydays, so you have to consider thouse 2 hours as overtime???  NO!! ...that and including, the pay sick and the accident sick, this month for example i had 1 gardener bitten by a snake and another one stunk by a bee, you think is easy???  NO!!  i have to fill 2 different forms in HEBROW!!!! do i read HEBROW!!! NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! so i called the israely secretary that works in Haifa (very sweet lady but she's never there) or one of the local gardener to translate and help me... well have you ever read a form made by the goberment??... well can you imagine a gardener that doesn't speack english very well trying to translate one??? ... well... is worst than that... So considering all this facts... i proced with the accounting, at the beginning they had pounchig cards, so i had to collect them every 26th of each month and count hours in a looong complicate process... then sombody had the great idea of bringing TimeLOG "THE FRIENDLYYYY TIIIIIIME MAAANAGER""" it look nicer at least, each gardener has his own card now... they come punch.. leave punch... that's it! beautiful... for them, the program collects the hours and process them and every end of the month i am suppouse to get a exact calculation of the pay period for each one of them with each one of their extracomplicate contracts... and thinking that life is GREAT and i have my life solved i worked with Krisia and we created around 20 different work rules for them with different holyday calendars and overtimes calculations... my friend Krisia is extra-super intelligent ok! and she loved computers and programs... i don't know anything about them... i just know my Cad programs and i'm happy... well she had troubles creating this stuff... but we did it, and then she left, she went to Barbados and then Europe and then Spain... and i stayed... i was thinking everything was fine... but NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! it wasn't fine... i correct the problems, i put all my very relax neurons into acction and try to figure it out how the hell you do this... and thank God they worked... i was happy about it, cause i taught i was not that computer smart... but the program started to work slow... slower... and s
