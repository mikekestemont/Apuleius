Hi everyone. this is my blog, and i'm just starting out. I will be talking about things that are on my mind.  Did anyone see the big Dean concession speech in Iowa Monday night?  Wow!!  He probably shouldn't have done that, but i think that it is being blown way out of proportion in the press.
Well, today the White House released the now famous 8/6/2001 Presidential Security Memo that apparently warned that Osama bin Laden was determined to strike in the US.  It seems that they wanted to sort of cover this up because they released this on a Saturday afternoon on the day before Easter Sunday.  Iraq is still a mess and I think that the June 30 handover of power has to be reconsidered because there is no one to turn power over to and because there is a civil war going on there.
Well, today, one year after the fall of the Saddam Statue in Baghdad, Iraq is in complete and utter chaos.  It seems that both the Shia and Sunnis are now united, against US!!!  It is being reported that two Americans have now been kidnapped by insurgents, with four Italians.  Then there are a few Japanese who are being held and if Japan doesn't withdraw in a few days, then they will burn them alive.  Anyway, hopefully nothing else happens today.
Post: Iraq is a major failure!!! last weekend, iraq was really plunged into a civil war.  revolts are spreading throughout the country and our troops are dying every day for an unelected president.  i suggest that you go to the  urlLink   nytimes read Maureen Dowd's op-ed article today.
Well, today Condi Rice testified before the 9/11 commission today, finally!  soon bush and cheney will testify, together, in private and not under oath.  anyway, have a good weekend, lets hope nothing explodes in Iraq.
BREAKING NEWS:  Israel Strikes  Today the Israeli Defence Force (IDF) struck a car in Gaza that was carrying the new Hamas leader and killed him.  I wholeheartedly support Israel in their struggle against terrorism.  This is great.  *Note:  I would have written this blog sooner but my internet was unfortunately down for a few hours and just went back on.
Today there was a suicide bombing at a border crossing between Israel and Gaza which has injured 4 Israeli officers.  Israel should just pull out of these Palestinian areas, build a huge wall to separate them, and then just leave the Palestinians to do whatever they want in their own little country.  Then, if something happens in Israel from the Palestinians, Israel should strike back.  The US should back all of this.
Today Al Jazeera is airing footage of a US army soldier who has been kidnapped in Iraq and is being held by insurgents there.  Hopefully he will be released soon.  The  urlLink New York Times  Op- Ed page is great today.  It talks a lot about Iraq and how it is a mess.
The CIA sucks!!! It really does.  Director George Tenet has had two huge intelligence failures on his hands, 9/11 and Iraqi WMD. Bush should fire him.  Tenet must have something on Bush.
Today there is a new Osama bin Laden tape out, and Secretary of State Colin Powell says that they think its real.  In it he offers a truce to Europe if they pull out of the Mid- East.  In other news, today there is reaction from the Arabs to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon meeting with Bush yesterday and them agreeing to pull out of the Gaza strip completely, Israel retaining some settlements in the West Bank, and not recognizing the "Right of Return" for Palestinian refugees.  I have to say that this is one thing that I agree and support Bush on.  Israel is the only democracy in that region of the world and America needs to support it.
I'm not in a good mood today, but I won't get into that.  Today I have to admit, I have nothing to say because not that much has changed since my last blog.  Talk to you later.
Well, the President just finished his press conference.  It was ok.  He claims that the fighting in Iraq is just in parts of the country.  He was scared about a question comparing Iraq to Vietnam.  OK, well, I'm really tired now so I'm going to sign off and go to bed soon.  I just hope that I will wake up tomorrow and not see bad news about more dead soldiers or possibly a terrorist attack.
The 9/11 Commission just finished hearings for the day.  Attorney General Ashcroft was at the end of the day today.  I have to say, the hearings are pretty boring to watch.  There are no, "What did the President know and when did he know it?" type moments.  Bush has his press conference tonight.  He has not been having a good couple of weeks.  I'll update this blog later after the Press conference.
Apparently Bush is going to have a Prime- Time Press conference tomorrow night at about 8:30 ET.  What is he going to say when he is questioned about the hundreds of troops who have died because of his little misadventure in Iraq?  We'll see tomorrow.
Today more American soldiers have been killed in Iraq.  The uneasy truce has fallen apart.  Still a mess.  We have to get Bush out of office.  Read Howard Dean's Op- Ed in the NY Times.  Its great.  He says that we all have to fall in line behind Kerry and unite to beat Bush.  Air America radio talks a lot about supporting Kerry too.
So, today there are reports that a few Chinese Citizens have been taken hostage in Iraq.  Now it seems like they will do anything to anybody.  John Kerry is right that foreign leaders are probably saying that Bush has to be beaten and we need someone as President and leader of the free world and the world's only superpower who actually consults our allies before going into a unilateral war.  Do you remember all the goodwill and support that we received from the rest of t
