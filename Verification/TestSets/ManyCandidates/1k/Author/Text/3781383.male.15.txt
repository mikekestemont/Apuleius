Today is my last post for the next three weeks, I am going to the Upper Peninsula.  Time for beer bashes, pontune rides, lake livin, and just plain summer fun.  I will be driving most of the way and the drive can take anywhere from eight and a half to 11 hours.  I will be able to drive all the time up there because I am the only one underage besides my sister and she is staying down here to work.  She is so poor she even owes me money.  The sad thing is, I can't even pay attention.  Today all I get to do is pack and maybe put away groceries if I'm lucky.  I am going to RC sports to buy a new stringing kit for my stick because I need something to do for three weeks, and is going to take a full day for me to string it.  I have been listening to a lot of music I usually would make fun of.  I kinda like country now.  My favorite country song is "Cause the Chicks Dig it".  I also like "Hell Ya", "Redneck Woman", "Beer for my Horses", and "If you Ever Stop Loving me".  I've had nothing else to do all summer except junior golf.  I am fifteen and I have to golf with, like, 12-year-olds.  At least I get to hang out with one of my best friends, Jake.  Jake is probably the only friend I have who my parents or my sister doesn't make fun of or say they are a bad influance.  He is also the only friend I have that is almost exactly like me.  We both play sports.  We are golf buddies and I got him to try lacrosse and he got me to try hockey.  They are very similar.  We also both have older sisters who we dispize.  Our sisters are also kinda friends.  My sis is a church lady and so is his.  That is why my sis thinks Jake is "good people".  I have a couple of friends who are really nice to me and some who i could do without.  I have one friend who is a real hard ass.  His name is Ben and he can be an on and off friend.  When we are one on one or with some of my other close friends we are really tight.  Any other time...he gets pissy.  My old best friend, Eric, was one of the nicest people I know.  Keyword...WAS.  He started hanging out with some real tards.  This one kid Tony really gives me a hard time.  Eric and I started hanging out less, then we stopped talking on the phone, then he changed his AIM name and never told me.  Now we have verbal battles in the middle of classes.  I still try to talk to the old Eric every once in a while, but he is almost gone.  That is about it for today's sob story.  I tried to give you enough to last for three weeks, but I'm not sure.  Maybe next time I'll talk about my friends who are girls...not girlfriends (I'm a loser).  Now the Rachels and Christene won't feel left out.  I can't forget Kelley either.
I had a blog on blogeasy, but my comp screwed up every time i signed in.  This is my first blog in a while, but I'm sure it will be a smooth ride.  My life can be interesting at some points, and sometimes it isn't.  I play JV lacrosse for my high school and next year i will most likely make varsity because my postition (defense) will be needed.  Follow my life as I walk through the halls of Davison High School and battle with depression, weight loss, girls, and homework.  Right now it is the summer and I am leaving in three days to spend a few weeks up at my cabin on Lake Gogebic.  There are some nice places to eat *cough* and drink *cough*.  I have my driving permit so i can drive with a parent.  That makes me the designated driver.  I might post tommorow and then I'm off.  See you in 3 weeks.
My trip to the U.P. was pretty uneventful.  There were a couple of cool things, though.  I got to drive on the way up there but my mom was freaking out because she was falling asleep and the over 21 driver cant fall asleep.  She got some coffee and took over.  I only got to drive for about three hours.  We also got some really good pasties from this place around the Seiney Strech.  My mom likes hers with lots of vegetables.  I just got mine with meat'n'taters...  While we were up there out neighbors, who actually own the country club down here, had a surprise party.  The Minto family was having a surprise party for the husband, Mike.  He was turning fifty.  My family are close friends with there family and we went.  They are on the other side of the lake and it was going to be a boat tour, so we drive our ghetto boat.  It is a 20 foot pontune boat that only has a seat for the driver so we have to bring plastic chairs on.  It is a lot of boat to be pushed by a 28 horse motor.  It takes a good 1/2 hour to go the three miles acrosse the lake.  The party at the house was very fun.  I started out with Mike getting home from Brook Trout fishing (which was a set up).  We had drinks and apatizers for like 20 mins and then we got on the boats and headed north for the Hoop'n'Holler.  Our boat was the first off the dock, and there were about five there.  We were going full tilt because we knew everyone would catch up to us.  When they did one of the people had a really big speed boat.  We got caught in its wake and it drove our front under.  We got to the Hoop and found out t
