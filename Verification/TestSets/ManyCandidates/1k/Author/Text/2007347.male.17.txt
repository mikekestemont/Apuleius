One of my pet topics is this whole battle of the sexes, since i live with both men and women its good to know the difference between the two parties. But the division may change with the production of testosterone for over the counter usage. this scares me, because i dont want women to be more like men, because then they arent women, and i dont like the idea of just a single gender species. Gender and sex: there is a difference, you can have the sex of a male but the gender of a female, or visa versa. Sex is the physilogical person, Sex is you have male genitals your a man, you have female your a woman. Fine, Gender is different, gender is the physilogical traits and the psychological traits. Gender male: you have male gentials and like cars, shorts and sports. Gender Female: You have female genitals and like dolls and dresses and talking. when the genders cross over, Nances and tomboys thats when there is little distinction. SO! my point is that testerone doses to women is bad. Because what that shows is that you dont liek who you are. You arent proud to yell i AM MAN/WOMAN HEAR ME ROAR.  one thing that is strange is the abuse of us fellas by womenfolk, ok the past has been pretty patricarchal, but its not like us guys arent easy to manipulate. but lately women seem to always taking the piss at the fellas, and with good reason. 90% of crimes are done by men, men are violent, arrogant, pig-headed, risk-takers (far beyond the point where its rational) overly compeditive and the worst communicators. We are more senstive emotionally, yes! we dont show it. and have a weaker immune system. Out bodies are weaker, it burns out faster maximum mileage of a man is 140 years. a woman is 150 years. And men are more likely to commite suicide.   that is a given, most people know all of this, or some of it. but what about the othe side of the story. Us guys are stronger, physically, we are more active, we have the capasity to work harder and the capasity to work longer. we are more driven. We are more amibitous. We are better in science, Information technology and maths. We are better engineers, we are better soliders. our bodies are designed for all of the above.   Why? WHY are men like men, well firstly because we are taught to be this way. by parents, teachers, tv, etc. and most teachers are women and the more dominant parent is the monther:P. But us guys naturally blame something we cant control. Testorone, this is a hormone, and guys have 3 times of this hormone than what girls have. this is essence of man in a bottle.   the difference between guys and girls stem form differnce in the concentration of hormones, progesterone, oestrogen, testerone are the biggies. testerone makes you more violent more active more agressive, stronger in physic, weaker in immune system. tests were done where testerone were given to women, they became more like men. there you have it. but i disagree on women taking this hormone. they want it to be able to support a career a family and a social life. they dont have the energy to be the breadwinner and the housewife at the same time! testosterone opens up the energy and invigorate the body. so they have the energy to keep going. Think of it this way, how often do you meet a single father who doesnt have the energy to do everything? Time is another matter....  but dont forget the bad side of men. this will be in women too! they become more reckless, more bastardly more of a prick than before. diversity is key in the theory in natural selection, if we all want to be men and do man things, what happens when the wind changes? What happenes when the womenly positives are more suitiable? you know? the verbal skills will vanish, the coperative powers and drive for harmony not ones own self will be destoryed, and if the conditions change we will be fucked. What proper fucked? Yes tommy, before ze germans get here....
I was at a party last night, Yes a Party. i supose you could call it a party, really it was some people over at Sarahs, it was good fun though, the guys were like guys the gals like gals. mad fun. i coulda won bilionare too if i have found that ruddy property card in time. eeeeuch. I do hope i didnt make any enemies this time, none of the others seemed to be too annoying. Hooray. now Sarah invites me to churchie mcchurch. should i go? i dont have anything better to do so i dont know. Luke was there, i dont think anyone noticed the fact that he has a bad habit of trying to have the last word. fish was funny with his coupling thing with me, i think everyone esle laughed nervously, im surprised some of those people were so homophobic, meanwhile i frankly dont care, just dont try anything on me, keep your hands to yourself boys. Simon kept himself in check this time around, good to see, hes finally hit pubity insiting hes paired with a girl for any activity, very good progress. Sarah seemed preoccupied with other people, and she called ME a Snob? well well, Enter the Hypocracy. Oh one fellow was alot fun, Josh. Yay, he wasnt happy with my choice in music. I dont know why, i mean i dont like garage rock. so i can understand that he doesnt like Korn or ICP, or Disturbed. But contrary to what he thinks, They arent Satan Worshipping whatevas but even if they are what does it matter, ive still got my head fixed on proper. And clearly i withstand "Brainwashing" as he calls it, i mean, im  a Muslim hanging with a bunch of christians, when You Dance with the Devil, You wait for the s
