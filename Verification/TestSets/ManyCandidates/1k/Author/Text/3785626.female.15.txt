This is lovely. A new blog, a new life, just "a new." Well today was extremely boring. My brother wouldn't take me to Starkville so I couldn't get my Blue Converse. Darn him. I went to my Aunt's house for supper. She can cook good. I  NO . Because that's my friend, and plus I go with Tregory. So yeeeah, that will just make the tension worse. Oh well. Anyways that's my day. I will try to update alot. Later. <3 Cherry
What an interesting day today. I woke up around 10 to get ready for my dentist appointment at 11:30. Yes, it takes me an hour to get ready. Haha. Tregory called, YAY, I didn't get to talk to him yesterday. Poopy. But anyways...I have no cavities, BUT I have to get braces so I can have space for my wisdom teeth. I don't want braces though. :( MAYBE I can talk my dad into getting those invisiline braces. :D Happy Me. Anyways we ate at Bumper's. Yummay. Then I mowed the front yard, took a shower, and I was going to get my haircut but they closed. My dad said that alot of stores close on Tuesday afternoon. *rolls eyes* STUPID HICK TOWN. Anyways now I think I'm going to take a nap. I'll mow the rest of the grass tomorrow maybe. Yeeah. Anyways holla. Love, Cherry
Woot Woot. Okay lets sees here, I woke up at 9:30, from a really bad dream, which sucked. Then I mowed the grass which sucked even harder. Then I talked to Tregory for a while, then I took a shower, which makes every thing better. What a shower can do to yaz? Anyways later today I'm going to the lake and watch the perty fireworks go Boom! I hope it doesn't rain, but then again it might be fun for me...to run around in the rain. Teeheehee...everybody else will be runnin' for their lives and I'll just take my sweet lil time. So anyways I think I might wanna be a counselor or something when I grow up, or a psychiatrist, cause lots of people come to me with their problems or I just like to give advice...Teeheehee...But I might wanna be a neurologist and work on the brain. Wooohooo...Lol. Well I'll be bloggin' later tonight. Teeheehee..BLOG is a cool word. Blog Blog Blog. Okay yeah I'm hyper. Laters...Cherry<3
Today was good. I woke up around 10:00, Tregory came over at around 12, left about 3. Then dad had to go to Grandmother's so I had to watch mom. Dad came back at around 4:30, Chris took me to Starkville. Shoe Dept. didn't have my Chuck's so I'm probably going to buy them off the internet. Should have checked at Hibbet's though. Then we went to JC Penney, I bought 2 shirts and 1 for my mommy. Then we went to Wally World. Got me a SpongeBob Rocker notebook and some Sharpies and some Candy. Wheeee...Then we went to China Garden and got food. This was my first time ever to eat with chopsticks. And I'm Asian!!! Oh well, it was fun...Tomorrow is the Fireworks Over The Water at Choctaw Lake. I'm going and gonna have fun I guess. Lol. Spuddy came over for a few to chill, he told me what Javors and Mary told him to do...>Try to go with me instead of Amber, because of what happened between him and Tregory. He said he wasn't gonna do it, because that is disrespectful and all. He thought I was going to be mad, I would only be mad if he would have tried to do it. Plus, I'm helping him and Amber "talk"...So yeeah, he wouldn't wanna upset me. Lol. Anyways Tregory left his pullover at my house, so now I'm wearing it. Teeheehee...*sniff sniff* :D  Well layder people. Hyper! Hyper! (Off Skittles n Gummi Bears) <3 Cherry <3's Tregory <3
Today was too boring. Woke up the lovely sound of an egg beater. My dad was making a cake for my mom's birthday tomorrow. JULY 4th. I did nothing, then about noon I went to the store, got some stuff. I saw Claire. Then I went home and did nothing. Called Tregory about 3. Wheee! Fun. Then I did nothing. Now I'm doing nothing. Tregory called a few minutes ago. I'm so Happee!! Lol He got to go shopping. Lucky him...Anyways I think I'm going to stay up ALL night. I'm bored. I have nothing better to do. I don't wanna go to sleep really. I might clean the whole frikkin' house, who knows. Anyways I'll holla. <3 Cherry//Boredom Has Struck

Okimidokies...Tregory came over and we chilled. Then about 6 me, Tregory, and my brother went to Choctaw Lake for Fireworks Over The Water, which really doesn't start till like 9:30, but they tell you to get there early. So we get there, nothing to do but walk around and eat. Tregory's cousins weren't there so he had to spend all day with me. Lucky Him. Teeheehee. Anyways then about 9:40 the fireworks started. It was very cool especially over the water, and with Tregory <3Cherry<3'sTregory<3
My life is being sucked into the blackhole of boredom. I don't think last year was as bad as this maybe it's because I'm in Ackerman. The only person I hang out with is Tregory, or Spuddy or Mary if they come over. It's kind of sad, like 8th grade summer was off the hizzy forshizzy, I guess because I was such good friends with Krista and she lived like 5 minutes away. And I went to Oneighty alot so I could see my buddies. And now I move to this redneck hick of a town and I get excited when I go to Wal*Mart. *sigh...* Nobody gets online a
