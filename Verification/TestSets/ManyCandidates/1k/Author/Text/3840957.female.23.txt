16lbs 14oz.. He's in the 95% percentile for weight, babies his age.&nbsp; What a big boy.
The tourists here in Bancroft are so awful. They do NOT stop for anyone to cross. I waiting at an intersection for more than 10 mins, before walking out and making them stop for me. My mother managed to dart in front of traffic, leaving me behind. I started yelling to her from across the street, something to the effect of Tourist being rude,&nbsp; they have no consideration for anyone but themselves.. I think they did here me, because they did slow down. :) Before Grant, I'd be complacent and just wait. He made me this way .....
urlLink    Mason loves his car seat..wouldn't you tho?? It's so comfy looking.&nbsp; urlLink
We bought the "Alpha Omega Elite" carseat for Mason about a month or so ago. It is a three in one; rear facing until 22lbs, forward facing until 40lbs I think and than a booster seat. We decided to put it in the car today. Wow, what a time we had. Grant was so fustrated! His car doesn't really fit it well.&nbsp; I think it's about time we got a four door. Finally, after about 1 hr, we got it in, all situated and safe.&nbsp; We went for a test drive, with Mason in it, and he just loves it!!!!
Mason and I had a good time in Sarnia!!&nbsp; We didn't do much, because it was so hot there!! But Mason got his four month shots.&nbsp; He kinda yelped when he recieved it, but was super after.&nbsp;   I am such a first time mom :) I noticed that Mason was peeing a lot, so I had to call the Telehealth line, to see if it was normal. Well, all the nurse said was to watch what the pee looked like, to see if it was wierd colour or if it had a smell. I don't make it a habit to smell his pee, and I started to smell it. It did have a funky odour, so everytime he peed, I'd smell it. Well, Let me&nbsp; tell ya..It's not a good idea to do that. I wasn't feeling the best at night :P&nbsp; And, the smell was just from his diaper.. yuck!  We got home around midnight on Friday, after going to this fancy place called Baldwins in Aurora :)&nbsp; We were definitly under-dressed for that place.&nbsp; We did end up eating at the Purple Pig, a&nbsp; place more fitting for us.  &nbsp;
urlLink    Not a good picture of us, but a good picture of Theo Huxtable .. see him on TV???&nbsp; urlLink
Mason can now roll both ways. From his tummy to his back and from his back to his tummy! He doesn't like being on his tummy to much tho. We put him in his playpen, and went outta the room. When we came back to see him, he was on his tummy, sleeping!  What a good boy!  I went to Weight Watchers today, and I lost 4lbs...not to shabby!
We travelled up to Petawawa this weekend, our old stomping grounds.  Grant's friends up there are dumbass's. I'm glad we aren't living there anymore.  We visited one of his friends with three boys, ages ranging for 15months to 6 years old.  I almost had a nervous breakdown there. The kids were NUTS.  They were hitting and beating each other, jumping from the back of the couch onto the hardwood floor, AACK.  The 15month old smashed his head off the floor, but just shook it off.  Their parents didn't do anything to stop it.  His other friend that we visited wants to get rid of their Rottweiler.  He's such a great dog. I'd so take him, if we had a house :P We went to Walmart up there as well, and stocked up on baby supplies. We bought a new stroller too. Just a lightweight one. But the handle is so short, that you can't take long strides with it, or else your toes will bang off the wheels!
Well, I'm going to be in Sarnia all next week. We're meeting up with Val and Wayne at the Toronto Zoon on Sunday! Should be fun, I haven't been there in the longest time.  Than, I'll be off to Sarnia and Grant back to Borden.  My mother is going to have a whole week to herself, whatever will she do?  It willl be nice to get out of Bancroft though :) Mason is almost 4 months tomorrow, and he's supposed to get his four month shot! Well, the doctor that will take him here, won't see him until August 20th! By that time, he'll almost be ready for his 6 month shot. So, I'm going to go to a walk in clinic in Sarnia and get it done. Mason hasn't been checked out since, well since he had his trush looked at.  I want to get an exact measurement of his weight. I think he's around 17lbs! Big eh??
Mason has the worst temper I have ever seen on a young child.  I was out for a walk today, and he was all nice and sleeping. He woke up and all of a sudden, he just started to scream and cry! I think he may have had a nightmare.  But, he wouldn't stop crying. He screamed all the way home, about a 10 min walk. I felt so dumb, people must have thought I was beating him.   But, he didn't have many tears. It was just his temper! We are going to have to beat it out of him.. opps haha not beat it.. but get it out of him. Mason is a punk!
Grant called tonight. He got some news from his warrent officer about us moving to Kingston.  We were originally supposed to go there in August, but Grant's course got cancelled and now it's not running until November. But, Grant has applied for "on the job training" and his boss said that we possibly might be going to Kingston in September or even soon! You never get an exact day with t
