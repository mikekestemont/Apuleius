This is my indept version of My Song - since i know a lot of u out there want to know what i was thinking when i wrote my poems and stories - so i'm starting with the first one i posted. NOTE: When this poem was written, it was supposed to be an exageration of today's world. Wat this world might become (keep that in mind)            My Song       Blinded by Imaginary Light   - The prase Imaginary Light - used alot in my poem - means something lyk this: If light is fake (and light allows you to see everything) then what is real (since this "fake light" is blinding you, and showing you the world wrongly - it is making it seem lyk the world is wonderful - but really, their is deceit and lies and trachory...This "fake light" is showing a "fake world". I hope that kinda helps you understand my description of "imaginary light" Remember..."If light if fake, than what if real?"    Forged from A child’s laughter And a burning tongue of Hate,     -  The imaginary light involves innocence "a child's laughter" (I used somthing lyk innocence because the "fake light" wants you to think it is real) and something evil - here the phrase "a burning tongue of hate" could mean an acual tongue saying horrible stuff - or could be thought of more as fire, lyk a tongue of flame, something that consumes everything in it's path - as Hate so offten does...     Who is to blame For this misinterpretation Of right And wrong?     -  Basically, this means that the world turned into a place where being bad looks good, or it is ok to get your vengance, and even on more or less extreme levels. And it is asking "Who started this? Why is that allowed?"...      This is my song     - This is where the peom gets it's name. I repeat it again and again meaning somethign lyk: This is wat i live by, this is what is out there, this is my dream, my hope, my attempt, my worse nightmare....ect....etc (however u spell it lol)      Surrounded by A substance of Shadows     - Shadows are basically nothing. They are the result of light being blocked out. Basically, the imaginary light hides the real world from us. When it is blocked out, the result is a shadow - something dark and scary, that shows the "true world" dark and scary (as told in the poem). Also the "substance" part is that shadows are nothing, so they can't be made of someting...in this poem they   are   made of something...    Made of Something A nonentity A hidden identity Mistrust of thought Teasing And tricking    - ...In this poem, the shadows are made of secrets and lies and trickery, all that stuff that lead to major problems between friends, enemies, countries, familis....Its sad isn't it?     And mistaking Weak from Strong, This is my Song    - did you ever realize that bad peeps are always picking on those more helpless, less strong, and more innocent? Just wanted to point it out.      Forced to trust A wisdom’s enigma, Destiny’s drama, An hypocrite’s dogma, The delightfulness of trauma.    - The phrase "forced to trust..."- stuff that don't make since but nobody will speak up agaisnt. "Wisdom's enigma" - wisdom brings great suffering, along with great power, "ignorance is bliss", wat that line is saying is mainly, we strive for wisdom, but understanding in it's own is confusing. "Destiny's Drama" - Destiny ("detiny {Just picture me doing lil quotes with my fingers lol}) "controls" our future. Things are happy, sometimes so wonderful. But then things are sad, dramatic, sometimes really sad. "A hypocrite's dogma" - people go against their religion - so how devote are they? They say they believe something than go agaisnt it - which basically makes them either a liar or a hypocrite. "The delightfulness of trauma" - meaning something lyk "we force ourselves to see beyond the bad, which is a good thing - but ignoring it all together doesn't help it become any better.     A lie told and retold Till it was almost the truth,     - This relates the poem in the sence that people trust this "fake light" which brightens the truth into making the world seem better than this. The truth  lies  (that is basically the whole point of the poem). But this line also points out that is a lie spreads lyk "a burning tongue of hate(or flame)" it almost becomes the truth.     From Shadow’s Solidity Comes a world of fake Radiance,    -    This takes the phrases from above, and kind of changes it - (I am thinking about rewording this part) it means: Just lyk a shadow is solid, the "fake light" is real. (it means that it isn't, because shadows aren't solid so the world's "fake light" isn't true)...    Nothing is left Of Moral’s honorable fight   , Moral is loosing, people thinks it's cool to be bad and that it is wrong to be good. That is basically wat that line means lol.     Truth’s flawless face Is now a scarred blight, Worsened by resisting That Imaginary Light,      -     basically, truth is "deformed" - people tell lies and trick and cheat lyk wild fire. (Now back to the "fake light" topic) And if truth tries not to resist the "fake light" (because the fake light makes it look lyk that truth is sill intact), truth becomes more "deformed"...basically...     And all along From Right to Wrong This is my song     - Mainly - no matter wat the world thinks, "This is my song"        What has our world become? Love is weak Hate is strong Who can resist? Who can hold out for long? Is this a song?    - This is the one time in the poem where the character feels worried that she won't be able to keep to her song. SHe is afraid that she will not be able to keep her head screwed on straight.        And whether We will ever realize the truth Or live lies Or I will even belong    - I
