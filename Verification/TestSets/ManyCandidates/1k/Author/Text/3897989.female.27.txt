Dear Journal, &nbsp; Good morning. I have another day of work ahead.&nbsp; It's amazing to me that my sleep has been so rejuvinating to me this week. I have such a positive outlook when I wake up each morning. I crave what the day has to offer to my being.  &nbsp; Breathing more deeply, have I been doing. Refreshing it is to fill myself with calming breath. I'm performing my tasks with a much greater ability. &nbsp; I had a very interesting phone conversation yesterday. I was initially greeted with such an uplifting spirit. Normally, that is not the case. But yesterday was very refreshing. Were they glad to hear from me? I think so. They must have gotten laid...that solves everything :D Of course, that is almost a distant memory to me&nbsp;:D I wish I had someone to "make precious love" to me. Someone soft, gentle, and patient enough to take time to&nbsp;experiment and share openly. Good luck, huh? :D &nbsp; Off to work, I must be. &nbsp; With love, &nbsp; BLG&nbsp;&nbsp;
Dear Journal,  &nbsp;  Today has started off wonderfully. Restful, quick sleep; entering sunshine on my day.&nbsp; I have been invited to go out with the girls tonight from my second job. It's going to be a great day!! I am blossoming. I've also lost a couple pounds this week. I've been working hard and it feels great.  &nbsp;  Last night we had a great class. It still seems strange to me that my instructor never gives me any advice, only gently nods of approving feedback while he spends so much time with everyone else reinforcing strokes, etc. My humble confidence&nbsp;continues.&nbsp;Even stranger, someone who is close to graduating in our class has to turn to me to be able to utilize the lesson effectively. It feels great to have the "best" and the prettiest of the group turning to me for guidance and tutelage.  &nbsp;  I'm looking forward to some free time for myself and the children Sunday. I found some great books on sale at work yesterday that I'm truly looking forward to burying myself in to relax.  &nbsp;  Thank you for my peaceful heart, my grateful existence, my energy from you, my universe. Thank you for letting "him" connect with me again to renew my strength in bonding and relinquish my ties to subtle solitude.  &nbsp;  With love,  &nbsp;  BLG
Dear Journal,  My heart guides me to continuance. Thank you for the closeness.  Today will be a great day. Off to delve into the books I go. With a new outfit, a new outlook, and a happy, giving heart.   Open to your true essence.  Love,  BLG  P.S. Class went really well last night. We practiced some openers and myofacial warming to prepare for deep tissue. I got to be the body. Our teacher is so talented. I wish he would embrace it more willingly. It's funny how he worked with everyone else last night except me. His observations were satisfying I hope. I shouldn't doubt myself. I know he was pleased.
Dear Journal,  I started my new 2nd job yesterday. I went to college years ago to train to be a bookkeeper, but now I'm a "Book Keeper" in a literal sense of the wordage. The first thing my new supervisor asked me was, "Do you like to read?" My heart climaxed with excitement!! I crave knowledge and find it quickly in books, even though I use several avenues to broaden my erudition.   My new job is very satisfying, so the 70 hour work week in combination of all my jobs is a contributor to the satisfaction of my soul. Not to mention my education. I have been blessed with a reason to enjoy my lassitude.  One of my friends gave me a satisfying trapezius relaxation last night during our class break. Lifting all those books yesterday played a number on my postural muscles. I am excited to have such a physical job and thank heavens for the maintenance of massage.   Speaking of our break in class...we were supposed to watch a medically related video last night.  The wrong video was in the case, so while she was out making copies, instead of learning proper handwashing techniques we learned how to give a personal test. and breast exam.....why do these things seem to always happen to me?!!  I got to see "him" last night. He's had a haircut that looks very nice on him. Of course, he's ever beautiful.  His hair is so soft and thick and full of tortoise shell colors. I've missed him terribly. I have so many things to tell him. At least his eyes sent me the guesture of happiness to have me in view for just a moment.   It's amazing to be able to feel happiness, sadness, longing, and desire all within the same realm of time within my being. Today I will be content; at peace with all that has come into my presence. I still have an unsatisfied need that I must ask my heart to guide me through. Asking continuance? Asking release? Only time will tell the nature of what I can endure through this lonliness. Have patience, your breath containing compassion and joy. Find a way to release your love so not to overfill your heart. Make room for the emptiness you must maintain to be ever flowing. Can I not say, I love him? For within that is such power to let go. To become a more loving creature of the universe. Your love, may you spread wide and far to the depths of all hearts who may share in your passion.  With love,  BLG
Dear Journal,  Tomorrow starts a new day in my forward forging life.  It signifies direction, determination, and desire to have peace that has gone too long out of my reach.  My heart feels it within my grasp when I am within the things I am most passionate about.   Take care of my heart, my head, my hands, my loved ones. Bringing me to peace...I reach for you, my star.   With love,  BLG
