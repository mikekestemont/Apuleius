So, it is Sunday night about 1 in the morning here in Indy.  It is Memorial Day weekend, so no work until Tuesday, which is fabulous! YAY!  I've really accomplished my goal this weekend of having a positive attitude and not being so sensitive.  Today, especially, was really nice.  I actually spent the night at my apartment, which may have been the first time all week.  And I spent the day cleaning and organizing.  It is not completely finished, but I can see light at the end of the tunnel for sure, and it is a very nice feeling.  We also bought some paint for the walls in the dining area, which will be a lot of fun.  I'm really happy for Dana.  She has met a new guy, Dan (go figure that would be his name, right?) But anyways...he is really great.  I like him a lot.  He is her age, 19, which is easy to forget sometimes because he seems so mature.  If something more comes of it, I think he will be really good for Dana.  He is really responsible.  He has a great job working as a mechanic for BMW and he owns his own house and at least 2 vehicles, completely financially stable at 19 which is beyond amazing.  But the more important thing than all of that is that he seems to be a real sweetheart.  He is treating Dana really well so far, which she totally deserves and needs.  She really seems to like him so much too, which makes me so happy.  I hope that she can see that this is the type of guy she can be with.  Somebody whose life is actually going somewhere and who treats her well.  I know that it will still be difficult for her to move on with her life and completely cut off things with Daniel (the ex, not Dan the new guy), but hopefully she will be able to see how much better she can do.  I foresee good things (or I really hope anyway).  So that's that.  And...well, I got an email from Uli.  Crazy.  I just had to laugh right out loud.  So, she and Ovi have been spending a lot of time together.  I had a feeling that he may be interested in her, but lo and behold, she seems to be interested too.  She said that he gave her a big hug and was holding her hand this week and her heart was racing.  Wow!  I mean what can I say.  I've always thought that Ovi was a great guy, even if we didn't completely hit it off due to the situation with Paul.  So I think it is really fantastic for Uli.  But I have to laugh I really do.  I mean Ovi is Paul's best friend.  So...Paul cut off things with Uli because he wanted things to beyond friendship without an actual commitment.  And she wasn't willing to have a relationship with him beyond friendship because of me and my history with Paul, which she told Paul, and knowing him as well as I do, I know he wasn't happy about that.  So, now, Paul's best friend may be hooking up with Uli.  And she and I, despite the distance, are just about best friends.  Poor Paul...haha.  Karma, my friend, karma.  Paul and Ovi have a special relationship so I don't quite know how this turn of events will affect things, but Paul could not possibly be happy about it.  I really shouldn't be happy that things are turning out so badly for him, but I don't know, I guess there is an evil side in all of us.  I just can't help but think it is a bit funny.  But more than anything I wish that he would think about everything and realize that it is his actions that put him in such a situation.  He pushes away all of the people who care about him.  Okay enough about that...Oh, but jeez it is funny...  Now, it's just about time for me to snuggle up to my sweet Joey, I do love that man...Life, again, is good.
I'm sad today.  And last night.  I don't know what is wrong with me.  I think I may be having anxiety attacks.  I don't even like myself lately.  Last week was very very bad, but I thought that I had gotten over that, calmed down a bit.  But last night was the same as last week.  It is like I cannot take an ounce of criticism.  If anybody says anything negative, I take off on this downward spiral.  I don't even recognize myself anymore.  I guess there are still traces of me, but where is that happy girl.  Duey Lightfoot once told me that he loved being around me because he had never seen me without a smile on my face.  Granted, back when he knew me, my life was a lot less complicated.  I make my own complications.  I always said that because I know that I do that, and I make my choices anyway, I would deal with the consequences. But sometimes it is really hard.  I really miss my friends.  But would that even really make things better? Or is it just something inside of me that I need to conquer?  It is the stress of trying to take care of Dana?  I do feel that is a huge part of things, but I do not want to blame others.  Not Dana, not Joe, nobody, this is my problem and I know I have to find a way out myself.  And I will.  I'm still that eternal optimist.  I will find my positive outlook.  I will not let these feelings take control.  I have to find a focus.  I have to be less sensitive.  I'm so sensitive and it is getting ridiculous.  I don't know how other people stand to be around me.  Today, in my car on my way to work, I screamed as loudly as I can.  I can't stand being around myself even, so I
