This is where it begins for me. I saw Jump, Little Children for the first time in October of 1995. And I became obsessed. In the psychological manic depressive sense of the word. And I dropped out of school and moved to the Atlantic coast and everything. This was a capital O Obsession. And it was mostly because of this album.   And what can I say about this album? I do happen to know it pretty well. From Jay Clifford's sexy voice to Ward Williams' now missing falsetto. The blend of pop and folk caught me square in the chest. And they had a cello! And I just happened to have had a crush on the head cello player in my youth symphony. it was a melding of a lot of things. But this is a pretty good record. Rough in some places, and early, but you can tell that there's talent here and if not anything new, than at least a fresh look at some things that don't totally suck. A lot of energy.   Now that I'm listening to the album again, for the first time in a good while I hear different things. I actually like different things. I prefer the melancholy wistfulness of "Matchbox Whistler" to the sunny danceableness (?) of "Smiling Down." Will the older and wiser Jenny still fall for the emotional pandering that is "Quiet"? It's a great song, but not unsimilar to your "Meet Virginia" and your basic Ellis Paul anything. Though, I still believe that "Quiet" has the greatest cello solo in all of popular music. There I've said it.   An interesting thing is happening as I'm relistening to the album. I'm bored with it. In my musical odyssey, I learned a lot about what goes into an album, and I realized I am girl who loves production quality. And this album has very little of it. The sound starts about three feet behind the front of your speaker and just sounds kind of weak. As opposed to the lush, big room sound of your Daniel Lanois for instance. Which means that this album gets by on it's merits, not production quality, but it just makes me think of what this album would have been with a budget. But alternate realities are another blog.   But I still do fall for the emotional pandering of "quiet," in case you wondered.  (By emotional pandering, I mean, songs that make you feel special cause you're just like the girl in the song, until you realize that your mortal nemesis feels the same way about the song, and you could not be less like her, and so now, whenever you hear the formerly special song, you just feel cheap and tawdry. But maybe I'm investing too much into that.)  And what does my darling daughter think of this the album that changed my life? She's fallen asleep. Sigh.
A few years ago, I was a music writer. And obsessed with music and musicians in general. And then I got married and had a baby and had less and less time for music as I was now having a real life. Then I discovered blogging and remembered my wish for an album review site, and voila! A way to rekindle my love of music and music writing and everything! So here we are.   I'm going to start slow with albums I love and have on hand and branch out from there. We may get in to stuff I hate. We may get in to stuff YOU like. Or we may get in to stuff my husband likes, as, we have that on hand, too. But we also have a really great cd store here right in town, so we'll see what kinds of trouble we can get into. Fun!!
Okay, first I should mention that Lily has not slept in her crib since that post. Well, we got her to sleep in her crib on her stomach and that's a big nono, so it's been back to the bed with us. Which really cuts down on that sleep deprivation that you hear about. It's just wake up, plug baby in, go back to sleep. So I am like the most well rested new mother in the history of the world. Except for maybe Catherine Zeta Jones. I'm going back to work tomorrow. I'm a little nervous about that, but it'll be good to get out and see my coworkers again. I've missed them. I got out last week and went to the meetup.com sponsored knitting event and that was fun. I learned another vital step in the knitting process (thank you Lou) and I'm well on my way to christmas presents for everybody. If you're at all interested in knitting, you abslutely MUST go out and buy Debbie Stoller's Stitch and Bitch. It's loads of fun. And if you're at all crafty minded, you MUST check out craftster.org. It's a great resource for people who like to make sumthin out of nothin. You know who you are. Well, my breasts are leaking (more about that LATER) so I better try and go feed this still beautiful baby. Thanks.
Today was my first day as a stay at home Mom and it involved a lot of breastfeeding and daytime talk shows. I haven't broken in to soaps just yet. But I suppose it's only a matter of time. Lily still hasn't learned to sleep in the crib, so it's basically on Mom or nothing, as far as naps are concerned. And I should probably mention that when she's not eating she's napping. (Except for maybe an hour or two of just alert time every day) That's question number one for the doctor in the morning. Don't worry, she's too young for immunizations so the doctor visits aren't difficult for the parents just yet. I even got a couple minutes aside to give love to our woefully neglected cats (Bert and Hero). And I did the dishes. That's literally all I did today.
