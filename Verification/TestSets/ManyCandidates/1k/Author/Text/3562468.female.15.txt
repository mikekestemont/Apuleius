gosh. sometimes i just get so frustrated i want to scream. of course i cant because its 11:40 at night and everyone is asleep. but if i could i would. because im getting just so sick and tired of everything. i mean my God, im trying. i put forth such a freaking effort to see those kids. they could care less though. all they do is smartass and make excuses. which drives me to piss and whine all night long. NONE OF THEM CARE. not a one. and theres freaking five of them. gah! i would kill to see those kids, but i think theyd rather skate or something. usually i wouldnt care, i enjoy watching them skate. i love the kids, but when im not there it pisses me off. when im like 'lets see a movie' its never "okay yay we get to see each other!" its "a movie? how boring." well. hmm. okay, lets do something unboring. like lets all go raid some skate park. considering the whole group cant skate, but what the hell. who cares about the skating impared kids. they can watch. gah. well. this sucks. tomorrow i wanted to do something but it looks like just another boring ass day. welcome to my world. ugh. i give up. i just...give up. gah i am such the little emotional kid. sigh. farewell.
well. today was boring. but i got the sick SOB permit!!! whats up! only missed one question too. hmph! well then i watched the lion king and the last samuri. the lion king was better, hands down. timone and poomba still make me laugh. sigh. well tomorrow i dont know what the hell im doing. maybe a movie with clayton, maybe watch the boys practice. who knows. fare well
