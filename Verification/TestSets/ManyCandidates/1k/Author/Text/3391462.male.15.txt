I am excited for Summer, I have tons plans but the most exciting that I get to go to Italy, My brother is there on a Study Abroad program. My brother is the biggest person in my life over anyone else that could possible impact me, my brother is well my hero, to say the least he is my inspiration to do the things that I do, participate in the ways that I act and try to act. Sure life is touch but I still know that my brother is there for me and will love me no matter the situation. I mean he is 20 about to be 21 and has been through the same hard path that I am taking so little hints and tips are always accepted. He knows how to be a teenager and then moving up to becoming an adult, more responsibility. My brother can handle almost anything thrown at him, and I look up to him for support about all the issues that I face, being that as it may he is the one person that I know can help me. Better then 100 social workers he is the man with the plan! And will soon teach me how to drive like a man! ADAM I LOVE BEING YOUR BROTHER!  Â 
There is one thing that I have learned about highschool, it's really first impressions and the way that you make your impressions and the way that you act those first weeks really impact your way of life at home and school. Don't come off too strong because it can scare away people and you will need to work back their respect. The Fact is that I have ADD and making friends is a hard thing to come by but once you connect with those people that you know like you, you have hit the jackpot. After Months I figured out where in the "ranking" I was (mentally) among the students I tried hard to get to the top as fast as I could. But knowing my place, I knew that I couldn't acheive my goals alone. There is a point where you try to become friends with the most popular kids and you know they don't like you but you still want to be around them because of their coolness. I am one of those people that believe in Karma so to speak I mean I am Jewish and that is fun and all, but there are parts in the day that suck but are replaced with laughs and high fives. I then think to myself, I will make it, there is always true hope for the people that have worse desires. Just think before you act, and try to make the good times good and have fun! Thank you Cathleen you are one of my dearest friends!
I went to Public school for the past 2 years. I was surprised by the number of kids like 400 estimated in EACH GRADE! I like the public life, there is more diversity and you are just another person in the crowd and by the time that you noticed the school year is up. $15,100 is pretty expensive and quoting Lauren Smilanich "High Class" people seem to be an overstatement. People need to understand that they aren't the finest of the fine because they are on a free ride in an expensive car, they believe that they can judge people because they are better than others and I am the one person here that cannot stand it! I don't understand why people can just be there and pick and choose the people that they like based on the looks and the perchance lack of dignity that other have from trying to deal with them. It just sickens me! At public school we had none of this, because there where so many races in the school that people liked the company of other races, at our school a black kid or Asian is a rarity at best. The ability to receive help is the best thing possible and the fact is that the more help the better, you can slack off and get bad grade and feel like the man, but not many people get that being a good kid can do better for you in the long run. I just think that there is a barrier somewhere that should have been broken between the public and private, just because a school is public doesn't mean they are all poor, and because there are a lot of kids are stuck up at my school doesn't mean that in fact all private school kids are snobs. Don't Judge it makes worse of the situation.
Normally at the stage in High school, there are those cute couples that have always been together and have always been there for each other. Also there are older guys dating younger girls and there is no real problem with that but it is the relationships that are thrown away because they want to decide that they want to date. But the love really was suppose to just really be a friend relationship, once you take the extra step then the entire relationship and then both people realize this and once they break up the relationship that they had before it goes with it as well. But also there relationships that work. When younger girls date older men they really don't think about the relationship long term, Especially if the age margin is big. Guys in highschool have one thing on their mind, Girls. Hormone are active and change behavior drastically. School is probably the last thing that we think about, other than finals. This segment is really for the guys, no offense to ladies at the moment but the more preppie the girl the less that you can trust them the more of a gut feeling that you have the least you can trust it. You need to wait there and let the women go to you. It is simple, girls and women are just a
