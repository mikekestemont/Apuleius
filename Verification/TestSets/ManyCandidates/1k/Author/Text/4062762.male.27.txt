"...there is surely nothing other than the single purpose of the present moment. A man's whole life is a succession of moment after moment. If one fully understands the present moment, there will be nothing else to do and nothing else to pursue." - Yamamoto's Hagakure&nbsp;

That common saying that "it's never summer in the sunset" is probably true from the looks of things over there today. But I can't say much more for the rest of the city, either. It's that whole  coastal  thing, I guess. It's probably soaring into the 90's less than 50 miles East of here, but we'll never feel it, even though it's July 29th and we're in the very THICK of summer.   On days like this, it's easy to miss the dense heat of summer mornings in Roanoke, Virginia.   Although it isn't easy to forget the way it feels, it's still hard to imagine that someone else is feeling that heat right now at this very&nbsp;moment.   ...the buzzing of insects, the flashes of fireflies at night, the steady chirp of crickets outside the open bedroom window on warm nights. It's an almost lonely feeling that&nbsp;this kind of reverie brings.   Harder still is it to imagine the tranquility of the Nigerienne desert landscape after the oppressive sun has set and the final call to prayer has ended. From far above, one would be able to point out the tiny fires that dot the landscape at night, revealing the modest settlements of the Fulani and Bela pastorialists who have long resided far from the local towns. Those towns, one would notice, produce the same red spots of cookfires along the circumference of larger groups of light, including traces of white light from whatever scarce source of electricity exists there--perhaps a single Al Haji shopkeeper's storefront or the dim glow of the 10-inch television screen that serves the entire neighborhood with a sort of open-air theatre. Children and elderly alike flock in droves to surround the tiny screen that sits on a short stack of large mud bricks outside the shopkeeper's  concession . They love the low-budget Spanish soap operas, dubbed into French (another language they don't understand) and aired with nighly regularity, usually following highlights of the latest presidential address on the state-run news programs. They laugh and talk loudly, making up their own plots to follow the images they see. Simple people, they are generous,&nbsp;lighthearted and inteliigent in all the ways that matter to them.   Their creativity knows no limits. It evolves out of a condition of scarcity. One must improvise when a breakdown on the regional highway between two towns can deliver a crippling blow to their fragile livelihood or even, in more remote areas of the extreme North, mean the choice between life or death for everyone involved. I once witnessed the inginuity of a local truck driver as he replicated his broken oil filter by hand from an empty coffee tin sealed with a rubber strap.    A sera , he said,  It's broken .   While the rest of us--villagers, travelling workers and livestock--waited in the sparse shade of the roadside  Goa  trees, the driver and his crew worked dilligently and patiently to fix the engine of the  grande camion . I walked over at one point to gaze in curiousity at their efforts and discovered that post-war German engineering, with all&nbsp;its glorious reputation of fine craftsmanship, had its limitations as well. Evidently, no matter how much constant&nbsp;maintenance you apply, you can't run a 60 year old engine&nbsp;along rugged laterite roads for years without it suffereing from the abuse. It would be like wearing a pair of plastic flip flops to hike for ten kilometers every day through thick sand and rocky terrean. The tattered rope they were using as a fanbelt was my first clue that this was not the first time they attempted to fix the ancient motor in that&nbsp;tired and rusty&nbsp;beast, but I realised that these were patient and persistent people dealing with an all-too-familiar problem for which they were well prepared.
...just at different points along the way.     &nbsp;   I mean, since I've started looking around at the rest of my fellow bloggers' profiles, I've noticed the&nbsp;commonalities we too often fail to notice when we pass each other on the streets on our way home... or stare shamelessly at each other, casually feigning fatigue, as we ride together on the train... or glance over at&nbsp;another reflection of ourselves&nbsp;driving in the car next to us, yes,&nbsp;the SUV that we would never own but which we're convinced somehow reveals the true personal character of its occupant.     &nbsp;   No, we're all pretty much the same. Same fractured thoughts, same incomprehensible emotions... same undeniable identity complexes...     &nbsp;   So right now I'm listening to Miles Davis on some kind of roadhouse blues-type rendition on this webstation I'm addicted to.&nbsp; Man, what happened Miles? It used to be&nbsp;you were blowin' like mad, in crazed and complex rythmic jams.&nbsp; Was it the Heroine? Why so cosmic and diffused&nbsp;... but I digress...     &nbsp;   I heard once that buddists have this notion that everyone in the world, that is, everyone you see on the streets, at the stores, in their cars, on TV, or behind bars&nbsp;is&nbsp;related to them through a kind of cosmic familial connection.&nbsp;&nbsp;I beleive it. It's hard to explain but easy to feel. I think it's got to be true, not for any logical or rational reasons (to which I happen to be prone),&nbsp;but for the same reason we are able to feel or at least imagine living another&nbsp;person's life--  which is&nbsp;unique,&nbsp;truly, but not so&nbsp;different.     &nbsp;   And why not ...&nbsp;the&nbsp;old woman sleeping on the sidewalk with dirty hair, the angry youth on the corner who stares at me&nbsp;as I pass&nbsp;(I don't break eye contact either, just give a look that demands mutual respect), or the regular on Larkin and Hemlock&nbsp;who comes out every night in her clear heals--you can tell she's not used to it yet because&nbsp;she'll soon get&nbsp;goosebumps from the cold, ...or the worst of the money-whores, the polished saleman&nbsp;who sizes me up for h
