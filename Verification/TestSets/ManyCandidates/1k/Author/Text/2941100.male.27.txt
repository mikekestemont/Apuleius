An particularly widly read person may be aware from other sites that I have written that:  "I'd had enough of the utter hopelessness of what I have been uncovering. So I have written a letter to the local MP. He kindly wrote back saying I should meet with him to talk about the 'issues'. This is a) A brush off or b) A good thing. I am unsure which as yet. "  I have written back asking pointy questions about: healthcare, Domestic violence and custody issues.  In light of up coming European parliamentary Elections I asked that perhaps they would forward me any printed material they have expressing their views on the subject.  After all the conservative party is large enough to have produced leaflets on every subject on the earth by now.  Mr Gale wrote back saying:  "I am not entirely certain that the issues you raise are specifically relevant to the European Parliamentary Elections or that, therefore, there is 'any printed material' of the kind to which you refer."   So the conservative party do not think that these issues are relevant...  Or to say it clearly they find them irrelevant to Europe.  Perhaps they might be shocked if we bring up some EU rules on the subject?  Like human rights rulings... I will investigate.
Discrimination against men is outlined in our publication of that name. The major areas of concern are :    the divorce racket and social policies which reduce men's rights in the     family   state pension entitlement   health care provision for men   lack of equal educational and training provisions to men   less than fair treatment in civil and criminal law   women-only facilities, without any equivalent for men   the imbalance of men's groups, in numbers and resources available,    compared with women's   the general denigration of men, and lack of representation of men's issues    in the media    the lack of representation of men's issues by MPs, in Parliament, and by    the Government.     Anecdotal evidence started to accumulate in the various father's and men's groups about the treatment of men, but without any organised attempted to quantify or publish reports on the situation. Of the issues listed above, it is matrimonial and family law, and social policies about the family, which have had the hardest effects on men. It has been no surprise that groups addressing these issues first arose.  In the late1990s the Internet became generally available, and men were able to network, not only in the UK, but world-wide. The lack of information through the press and media was remedied. The same treatment of men prevails in all Western World countries, including Europe, North America and Australia/New Zealand.    While this site does provide some resource it is not a primium sorce of data yet.
It is vital if one is to run any sort of campeign, that there be available relaibale statisics that have not been altered beyond use.  More than that the statisics must be generated from a resonaable population sample - it is not enough that one report show something it only becomes truely ecceptable if many reports show the same thing.  We can provide some statistical evidence of course but you the researcher may also be called upon to provide indipendantly obtained data.   A word of warning on that subject: the plural of anicdote is not data, but many people including leaders can sometimes be mistaken into believing that many isolated stories equates to facts.    urlLink http://www.coeffic.demon.co.uk  - This is a good source of precompiled data.   urlLink stats1.PDF  - This is a PDF of the pages should they nolonger be available.

The sad truth is that this small site could in fact be the best resource for ending the Gender war than any other "Man's Lib", "father's rights" or "Male Pride" site on the internet at the moment.    That is not pride, just the sad conclusion that has driven this site into being.  We will aim to cover the issues one by one in depth and properly.  We will examine relevant news when it occurs and provide a regular digest of the facts for our readers.  We aim to provide every link and resource necessary for campaigners and researchers to get to the bottom of the issues.
In light of this controversial "speaking-out" it MUST be pointed out that there will always be two sides to every story.  In a "He said - she said" fight "She" will have done wrong as much as "He" will.  The fact of the matter that no matter the side you crown as saint that saint will be as much a sinner as the "evil-one" you have chosen to hate.  Sometimes there are manipulative people some male some female.  Some-times there is an aggressor and they are called the victim and the victim may be called the aggressor.  When something exposes the truth this can only be good.  But when some-one is the voice of that truth half of the listeners will call out liar.  Nothing is proven and nothing is gained.  When a liar is believed it is usually until the b
