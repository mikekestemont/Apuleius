So, the Greens chose David Cobb. Now, the question on my mind is: Who the hell is David Cobb? Is anyone going to vote for this guy? I get the feeling that after 2000, most people's opinion of the Green Party went from "undecided" to "negative", and choosing someone who nobody's never heard of isn't going to help matters. Meanwhile, the far-left who thinks Kerry sucks is just going to follow the Pied Piper of Nader,  urlLink whose ego continues to grow each day.   It's like I said downthread: if they're going to make any impact (other than "spoiling" the election), third parties need to gain some legitimacy. Don't keep going for the the blatant attention grab, concentrate on actually  winning  elections.
urlLink The story.    urlLink Official press release   An ex-Socialist candidate for President?  Ex-Green candidate for governor of California?  What, exactly, is Nader trying to pull here?  Is he trying to get me to vote for him?  You?  I thought he was only after conservative votes this time around....  Ezra of Democratic blog Pandagon  urlLink weighs in.   I think a bland socialist who has never won an election would make for an optimal Vice President.  Camejo would be far better than anyone on Kerry's short list.

urlLink Kerry proposes raising minimum wage.   I personally support a living wage of $10 an hour, but this is a step in the right direction.
urlLink Get Your War On   This Web comic / social commentary is awesome.  Here is their latest on  urlLink The New York Times / Chalabi scandal .  Here's a sweet  urlLink Voltron  reference.  I recommend that you read the whole thing.
The Independent Media Center has been an important organizing tool ever since its creation (only about five years ago). It is run by dedicated volunteers who want to help people figure out what is going on in this crazy world of ours. In times where we can never be sure when the corporate media is feeding us misinformation or omissions about events at home or abroad, the IMC has been a bastion of truth and democracy at work.   urlLink Independent Media Center   Here are my two examples:  This is an article that reports on the situation in Chiapas, Mexico right now. Many indigenous groups are struggling for autonomy but are met with violent resistance from the government and their paramilitary groups. Recently there have been some broad daylight murders of Zapatista supporters and the police have refused to open an investigation. Sound sketchy?  urlLink Zapatistas   And here is a link to an article about the anual biotech industry conference in San Francisco. There was a large group of protesters there that desparately wanted their voices to be heard. They had concerns about a number of issues that industry head who be making decisions about. Such as the continuation of genetically modified foods in our country, and the concept of genetic code as intellectual property. I always try, to no avail, to find info about these events in the mainstream media, but I always have to rely on Indymedia to tell me about these incredibly important events that will affect all our lives.  urlLink Biotech Conference
Come on guys, what are you reading?  Post!  Here's my next link.  It's to  urlLink Jesus' General .  Hosted by General JC Christian, Patriot, it shows how manly and powerful it makes you when you are both a Christian and a patriotic American.  One of his big things is writing letters, like  urlLink this one to CNN's Aaron Brown  about how great it is to have had all the Reagan coverage.  He also gives our Dear Leader some  urlLink advice  on his campaign and shows us how great  urlLink our American values  are.  Oh, and a must visit:  urlLink The Republican Jesus archives.  (he does a new one about every week.)
Are there any?   Nader  is cozying up with the reform party, introducing new anti-immigration and anti-porn and 'values' rhetoric into his campaign.  This  urlLink article  is from the American Conservative magazine.  Now, I don't know if this is a bad thing or a good thing.  He's still anti-corporate, but now it seems like he is just pandering to whomever he can to get a break.  But he's still fighting the two party system, and that is worth it.  Now, we have  the Libertarians , who recently held their nominating convention and picked  urlLink Michael Badnarik  as their nominee.  Yes, I know, I was just talking about not wanting to vote for stodgy old rich white guys.  But this is probably the direction I'm going this year.  They mostly want to get rid of government, and I agree with them on foreign policy (withdraw our military from other nations), drug policy (legalize), and most of their other major policy initiatives.  The only one I'm not too sure on is affirmative action (they're against it).  But, to contrast with Austin's view of getting rid of government because it enforces the concept of property, they want to strip down the government until the only thing it does is enforce the right of private property.  And I feel that at that point we would be much closer to being able to have the debate that Austin wants to have (and I want to have too).  So that's making my case here.   The Greens  seem to be planning their  urlLink nomination convention for July 24  but are considering endorsing no one.  If they do end up choosing someone, hopefully I'll be weighing in on that choice.  If anyone wants to research some other party like Socialist Workers or Constitution or something, I'd be happy to entertain their ideas.  So, the point is, why choose from the best of only two evils?  There are at least 5 or 6 evils to choose from....
Many blogs have a blogroll, that is, links to other blogs that the author frequents.  So now we have one.  But the links don't have to be blogs, they can be any site t
