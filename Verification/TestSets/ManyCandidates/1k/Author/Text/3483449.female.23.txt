Here are the topics of the day….   Voynich Manuscript - dubbed the most mysterious manuscript in the world is was discovered in 1912, by Wilfrid M Voynich, an American book dealer and collector, amongst a collection of ancient manuscripts kept in the villa Mondragone in Frascali, Italy.  The origin and language of the manuscript is unknown and there are no other examples of the text in existence, no one to date has been able to decipher the text, and it has been recently theorized that the text itself is just gibberish.  The text is small about 7 by 10 inches and consists of approximately 235 pages, and contains both hand written text and various illustrations depicting plants, astrological diagrams, and naked women.  A letter found in with the text from Joahannes Marcus Marci and addressed to Athanasius Kircher dated 1666 stated that the manuscript was bought by Emperor Rudolph ii for a sum of 600 ducats (approx. $50,000).  It has been thought that the author of the text is possibly Roger Bacon.   Roger Bacon -born in Ilchester, England in 1214 and dies in Oxford, England 1294, was a Franciscan friar and early advocate of the experimental method.  He worked on optics as well as alchemy, and was commissioned by Pope Clement IV, to write a series of books which amounted to an encyclopedia of science.  He taught at Oxford until 1241, where he received a masters degree and also lectured at the University of Paris. Most of his work he kept secret from his fellow brothers, but in 1278 he was imprisoned on the charge of “suspected novelties” in his teachings.     Polygraphiae Libri Sex -written by Johannes Trithemius, the leading intellectual of his day.  The first printed book on cryptology, the title translates to “ Six Books on Polygraphy ”.  It was published in 1518 after Trithemius’s death. The books include information on cryptographic schemes etc…   Johannes Trithemius - born Feb 1, 1462 died Dec 13, 1516…studied at the University of Heidelberg.  In 1482 upon traveling home from the university, was surprised by a snowstorm and took refuge in the Benedictine Abbey of Sponheim near Bad Kreuznach.  He decided to remain at the abbey and in 1483 at the age of 21, was elected abbot.  His goal was to turn the monastery into a center of learning and had transformed their library which contained about 50 titles when he arrived to containing over 2,000 titles.  In 1506 he resigned from the convent due to increasing differences and took the position of Abbot of the Schotlenkloster in Wurxberg, a position offered to him by Bishop Lorenz von Bibra, which is where Trithemius remained for the rest of his life.  His most famous work is Steganographia, written in 1499 and published in 1606, which was originally thought o contain text on black magic, however after publication in 1606 of the decryption key to the volumes revealed that it was a text concerning stenography and cryptology.  Other works of his included  De Septum Secundeis (1508),  Annales Hisaugiensis (1514) and  Polygraphia (1518).
Here are the topics of the day…   Hypnerotomachia Poliphili - one of the world most curious books, whose author is unknown, was published in 1499 and printed by Aldus Manutius.  The title is a fictional word derived from Greek and is roughly translated to mean  Poliphilo’s Love-Strife in a Dream .  The text is written in Latinate Italian and is an acrostic, the first letter of each chapter is a decorated letter, when all the letters are complied they read POLIAM FRATER FRANCISVS COLVMNA PERAMAVIT-“ Brother Francisco Colonna dearly loved Polia ”.  The work has been attributed to Leon Battista Alberti and even earlier to Lorenzo de Medici.  The story consists of elaborate descriptions of scenes involving the title character Polophili (meaning the lover of Many Things) as he wanders in a dreamland in search of his love Polia (Many Things).  The book is long sought after as on of the most beautiful incunabulum ever printed.  The typography is famous for its clarity and quality and the wood cut illustrations are noted as being the best part of the tome and depict scenery, architecture and characters.  The book itself is interesting as it sheds light on what people in the Renaissance fancied about the aesthetic qualities of the Greek/Roman antiquities.   Aldus Manutis - b. 1449/50-d. Feb.6, 1515.  Founder of the Aldine Press in 1494 in Venice.  Received a scholars training and studied Latin in Rome under Gasparino de Verona and Greek in Ferrar under Guarino de Verona.  In 1490 he settled in Venice.  He published the  Hypnerotomachia Poliphili , though his earliest tracts issued from his press have no date but include  Hero and Leander of Musaeus , the  Galeomyomachia  and the  Greek Psalter  which he stated were the “Precursors of the Greek Library”.  He was a fanatic of anything Greek and kept Greek scholars around him, spoke Greek at home and at his press and wrote edition prefaces in Greek.  In 1499 he married Maria the daughter of Andrea Torresano of Asola, who had purchased the press of Nicholas Jenson in Venice.  The marriage united the two presses and the names Aldus and Asolanus were associated on Aldine publications.  He is accredited for inventing the octavo book as well as the italic typeface.   Incunabula/Incunabulum -a book, single sheet or image that was printed before 1500 in Europe.  These are very rare and fragile and need to be verified by scholars in order to authenticate.  The origin of the word stems from the Latin “in cuna” meaning “in the cradle”.  There are 2 types of incunabulum:  xylographic -made from a single carved/sculpted block for each page and  typographic - made with moveable type on a printing press (this style was attributed to Johann Gutenberg).  Famous examples of incunabula include the  Gutenberg Bible  (1455) and  Schedelsche Weltchronik  (Anton Koberger, 1493).  The tally of the editions and titles printed before 1500 runs in the thousands and the most authorative listing is in the German catalog titled Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke which is still being compiled.
