Mood: Furious  Secularism is an inadequate and incompetent word. Other day, watching a group of India's high profile people from various sections of the society, arguing about the true interpretation ('cause it doesn't seem to have its own true meaning!) of the word, i seed them fail miserably. Its quite obvious that people who have their own agenda and goal will never agree on something that is contrary to their basic ideology. You don't need a expert psychologist or psychiatrist to understand that.....  That said, shall we try to first establish the need / end result, of the notion "secularism". All this talk about secularism is the direct consequence of the carnage and trouble brewing between people from different ideologies. I deliberately did not say religion because language, caste, culture and even race are a equal reason for all this trouble.  What is that, the lofty minds had in mind, when they framed our constitution and made India a secular country?  1. Did they want the people of India to recognize and acknowledge the ideals of all religions and coexist happily? 2. Did they want the people of India to be a-religious and coexist happily?  If they had wanted the first... they, it seems did not grasp the fundamental concept of religion and people's psychology. They had underestimated or over trusted religion and its fanatic proponents. Did they not know that accepting all other ideologies is in truth, the dilution of ones faith?  Or is it like - i will believe my own faith, but for the sake of everybody's good, i will act as if i acknowledge all other faith.(which translates to- i am holy; you r an ass, though i wont tell you that...) Obviously this will not last long...one small spark and all this hidden and repressed contempt will burst out. Let us accept this simple reality, even though it is a slap in the face, can anybody define god, religion and faith from a universal point of view and getaway with it without objection?. can everybody change his ideology, (which he believes like a fanatic) is the truth, even if it is cannibalism? Fanatic ideology is the part where man chose to remain an animal.  So... secularism is, for the religious, a euphemism to saying "you don't cross my way and i will not cross yours, for heavens sake!" for others it is a dilution of faith.  And the problems arise because there are more people of the former than the later, today. if you think, you can keep your faith strong and intact and also acknowledge whole hearted the truth and essence of other religion...please. don't deceive yourself again and again.  If you argue that all religions say to love everybody and it is those half baked people who fight. I accept, with the warning that, 99.9 percent of people are half-baked, then. For, it also says cows are holy and you should not kill it, and your neighbor has it for his dinner everyday. What do you do?   If you accept it you have diluted your faith, if you fight him you are a fanatic. Dilution of faith and its effects are.... much lesser considering that, the faith can be put into a less harmful sphere of bonding...but alas man always trusts what he does not see more than what he sees. It is true that a person will trust the unknown good rather than the supposed evil. he will trust god to any human any day, at least god is not supposed to harm you.  What if your parents taught you that you should kill your first child to please the god and get the blessings for the family and the society? What if the society around you acknowledged that as righteous? What if you were told that the sacrificed child was in fact god's child and that it is right that it should reach him soon? If you are pious and orthodox, you would do it, without guilt and celebrate the murder of your own child. If you suddenly feel that it is meaningless because no one is sure what happens after death, except the quack who calls himself the priest, you will talk about the human right to live and the horror of killing a just born baby.....and you will be branded as atheist, an outlaw and even be ostracized from the society...how much ever you shout no one will hear. What we are talking here is faith too, and such killings are not exaggerations, as even now we do have human sacrifices in the name of god. Take an analogy of a cultural faith- sati. Today sati is banned by the state, after making people realize the stupidity of it. That means there has been a dilution of faith, right? So all those woman are outlaws who don't do sati, among the orthodox. But as a modern (that is what some people. call themselves) man and maybe from a different faith, you might accept this correction in culture as good.   How much more modern do you need to get before realizing that cow slaughter (vegetarians pardon me) is not a sin which is going to anger the god and that you should wipe out those who think otherwise. How much more modern do you need to get before realizing that the true essence of religion is to ONLY ensure peace and to provide a guideline for a trouble free society.  How much more modern do you need to get before realizing that ultimately it is your fellowmen who are providing you your food, saving you from illness, creating wealth and also doing crime, and that there is no invisible entity governing the lives of the billions of humans on this earth.  That is the question.... how much more modern??? How much more time and more importantly how many more lives? If you can tell me how much more time you need then i can tell you when the world will be totally safe ......... and secular, if you please..
