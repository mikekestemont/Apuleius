WAR AND PIECE: A REVIEW FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A POST-INDUSTRIAL AGRARIAN  Date: 7-29-04  By Andrew Black  Peace
BOURNE TO ROCK   A review of THE BOURNE SUPREMACY   By Andy Black   This wasn’t my first choice for the title for my movie review for the movie THE BOURNE SUPREMACY. Rather, my first choice was BOURNE IN THE USSR – as most of the movie takes place in Russia. But unfortunately, in 2002 I wrote a review of the first movie THE BOURNE IDENTITY called – you guessed it – BOURNE IN THE USSR. My friends all said that I was crazy at the time. After all, the first Matt Damon thriller wasn’t even set in Russia. They suggested I call it BOURNE IN THE USA. However, in THE BOURNE IDENTITY, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) never even steps foot in the USA or even one of our non-continental properties (Puerto Rico, Australia).   So I decided to title my review BOURNE IN THE USSR – partly for irony and partly to pay homage to that great Beatles song, which I late found out was called BACK in the USSR. However, I felt that my readers* would be astute and pop-culture savvy enough to recognize this obscure reference. One friend, who since has stopped give me suggestions, came up with the title BOURNE TO RUN. I spent much time in contemplation over this and ultimately decided that BOURNE TO RUN would be a better title for the review of a yet unproduced sequel. The first Matt Damon movie, an epic confrontation between the CIA and a man with no memory, was not so much about running as it was about a man finding his true identity and learning to love again.   However, I feel that the sequel, THE BOURNE SUPREMACY, an epic confrontation between the CIA and a man with no memory of anything that happened before the BOURNE IDENTITY, is also not so much about running as a man trying to secrete his identity. And what’s next after you pigeonhole yourself into a special personal place among the billions of people who are each as different as every falling snowflake? You rock. This gave me a perfect title. Until I started thinking that the irony factor would have probably befitted this review a lot better (wasn’t the USSR always trying to gain supremacy?), and also, as I've said, a large portion of the movie is set in Moscow.   But this just goes to prove my point: when you write movie reviews, you have to be vigilant. I&nbsp;have already started to think of a title for the third movie in the trilogy, BOURNE FEVER. If he gets his ever-elusive freedom, I think I’ll call it BOURNE FREE.   * - As of yet, I don't have any "readers."
GREAT MOMENTS IN BLOG HISTORY  Jun 23, 1998 - Alberta, Canada - Edwin Soboda successfully creates the first "blog." Soboda, a grocery store employee, brainstorms and invents a forum for his personal thoughts as well as a venue in which to sell dented cans on-line. At the time, the "blog" goes under a different moniker: the "web log." Soboda makes about fifty dollars selling dented cans, but is credited as the creator of the blog. Says Soboda, "I really thought I could make a lot of money selling dented cans."  Jan 17, 1999 - Des Moines, IA - After a near-brush with death while walking at night on railroad tracks, Des Moines TV personality Jacob Anderson creates the first "celebrity blog," or, as it is called at the time, "celebrity log." Anderson chronicles his daily thoughts, ideas, dreams, funny TV stories, fears about the impending "Y2K" Crisis, and attempts at finding love with another Mormon in Iowa. Though the web site will shut down in about six months, Anderson paves the way for such revolutionary celebrities as SCRUBS star Zach Braff and former Cars leadman Ric Ocasek.  July 27, 2001 - Los Angeles, CA - Following two years of uneventful activity in the new-fangled world of "web logs," TV Producer Jerry Merle accidentally refers to the very popular "web log" of Ric Ocasek as a "blog." Since Merle is a very well known among celebrity gossip columnists, he leaks the news to the press. The next week, the LOS ANGELES STAR has as its headline: BLOGS SWEEPING THE NATION. Interest in Blogs rises for the next two months. Two years later, Merle would enter a witness protection program under the assumed identity of Robin Fitz in an undisclosed location (Joliet, IL).  August 8, 2003 - Des Moines, IA - Harve Brackett, a Des Moines corn farmer, uses his blog for scientific purposes. He successfully tests for growth in corn and notes the findings on his blog - titled "POPCORN! TEN THINGS YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT HARVEY B!" Harve successfully helps two farmers, one of whom was not his brother, with the scientific queries found on his blog. When asked about his contribution to blog culture and technology, Brackett noted, "I'm just a normal guy." Brackett was supposedly turned on to the idea of blogs by his friend, motivational speaker and former TV personality Jacob Anderson.  July 27, 2004 - Andrew Black opens his soon-to-be successful blog, ANDYTOWN. There are many questions, anticipations, and questions about the new blog but a previously inexperienced blogger. Black comments that his interest was piqued after he saw a documentary on blogs on HGTV. He hadn't planned to watch it, but it came on after the show where they give tips for vintage video games. As the blog community awaits, Black prepares a blog that is both unique and indistinct.
