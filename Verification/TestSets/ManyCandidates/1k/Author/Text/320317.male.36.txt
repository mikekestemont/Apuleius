urlLink Money 2002 Deluxe vs. Quicken 2002 Deluxe - Software Reviews - CNET.com  MS Money is the better product, but only if you are willing to use MS Passport. I downloaded and played with it last night. The UI is very good, plus it has "MoneySide" (see screen shot) when you are surfing other sites. I could sync with my bank at a cost of $3.00/month plus $10.00 set up fee.

urlLink ZDNet: Story: How living on a Mac nearly made me change careers  "IF THERE IS a creative bone in your body, it's hard not to look at the Macintosh and not feel something tingle--which is precisely what Apple is counting on."    &nbsp;I have always known this to be true, but when you hear it as clealry as that I can't help, but to finally make the decision to get a Mac (although I have one at work). Now the decision is which one. Flat Panel? without a doubt (Apple only makes computers with flat sreens now). Laptop or desktop? That is the question. Titanium or iBook?
urlLink New Site: MSN MapPoint   "Microsoft Corp. today announced the release of MSN® MapPoint™ through the MSN network of Internet services. Built on the MapPoint .NET Platform, MSN MapPoint expands Microsoft’s suite of popular mapping software and represents the beginning of MapPoint technology’s migration to Microsoft® .NET Web Services."   I heard on CNet radio that Microsoft really took a long look on how people really used map sites. Then again, they say that about every new product. However, the interesting thing is they designed the site by watching people's behavior, and how they were actually using the maps during and after printing them out... its all about users behaviors.
