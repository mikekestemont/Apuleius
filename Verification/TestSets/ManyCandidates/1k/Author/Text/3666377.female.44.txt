This time there were no bells to wake us at 5:30am.  Sigh ... I will miss the bells.  Gary took us to the train station in Koblenz so we could catch the 6:45 train to Frankfurt Airport.  We had all our luggage with us and it was a pain getting it all on the train and even then, the train was packed and there was nowhere to sit.  Tom and I stood up in the doorway area of the train for the 75 minute trip.  And they charged us full fare ... which doesn't seem right ... but oh well ... we made it.  Once at the airport though, things went very smoothly.  Because we were flying Business Class we didn't have to wait in the long lines with everyone else ... we got to go to our own special line and it only took a few minutes to get checked through.  The rest of the time we got to spend in the Admiral's Club and that was so nice and relaxing.  Coffee and juices and rolls and snacks for the taking.  Comfort and luxury!  On the plane we once again had the wonderfully spacious and comfortable seating ... mimosas before takeoff ... our plane left at 10:50am Germany time and arrived at DFW at 2:40pm Dallas time.  It was an 11 hour flight overall, I believe ... but it went very well.    It was good to be home.  Robbie was there when we walked in.  The kitties were there to ignore us.  The lawn was overgrown.  But the house was spotless and the pool looked really good.  We were home.
Today is a LONG travel day.  WE are served another lovely breakfast by our hostess.  This has been a wonderful B&B and if anyone is headed for Edinburgh, I'll get you the info for it!  Book early!!  The Taxi picks us up at about 10:00 am and takes us to the train station.  We have to take a train back to Glasgow then catch another train out to Prestwick Airport.   I'll say it again ... the train system in Scotland is AWESOME!!  Very Impressive.  Once at Prestwick we had time for a few beers and lunch before we had to get in line for our 4:30 flight.  At 2:40 there still wasn't a line, and there should have been so we checked with the desk and found out the flight had been changed to 8:30 that night!!  Yikes!!  Suddenly we had tons of time to kill and even I couldn't drink beer for that whole time!  Luckily, Monica had her Kniffle game with her so we had several rounds of that then we all settled into our books for awhile.     We didn't get very good seats for the return flight to Germany.  The plane was jam-packed and there was NO leg-room.   It was pretty miserable ... but we made it.  Then we had to climb into Monica's car and drive back to Koblenz.  We arrived back at Gary's at about 12:30am and proceeded to unpack and repack as Tom and I were headed back to the states in just a few hours!    We managed to get all the purchases packed and everything ready to go and fell asleep at about 1:30 am.
Slept like a LOG.  It felt so good!!  Breakfast at 8:00am ... cooked to order and served in an elegant setting.  There are only 2 rooms at this B&B and the other couple are eating later.  Our hostess is very friendly and talks us to death.  I felt bad letting her wait on us hand and foot ... but it also felt good!!  Taxi came at 8:50 to take us to the Castle where we will catch the bus tour.  The bus ends up being pretty big but Tom and I end up behind the driver and our seats are really cramped ... especially mine.  The driver is a riot and keeps a running monolouge through the entire trip.   It is an all day trip with our first stop at Loch Lomond where we catch a boat tour of the Loch.  The area is beautiful and the Loch is huge.  Many castles on it have been converted to resorts and even a hostile!  It felt great to be out on the water.   We then stopped in a small town for lunch and then it was off to Stirling Castle.  We didn't actually go through the castle ... Tom and I just wandered through the shops and enjoyed the sun and the breeze and the view of the Tussocks.  Sometime during this trip Michael stopped the bus so we could all meet Hamish.  Hamish is a large shaggy Bull with big long horns and he and Michael seem to have a wonderful friendship.  Michael bought some fruit to feed him and whenever Hamish heard Michael's voice, there he went.  It was pretty cool to watch.  We returned to Edinburgh at about 6:30 PM and went back to our B&B's to clean up a bit.  Our hostess had recommended a few Indian Restaurants nearby so we chose to walk to one of those.  The food was even better than the meal we had in Glasgow and the food even more plentiful ... but the bill was half, for some reason.  We then wandered all around the Holy Corner area looking for a pub but there wasn't one to be found.  So with tears in our eyes we retired to our respective B&B's for the night.  Heavy sigh.
Slept pretty well considering the size of the bed!  Still avoided the haggis for brekky.  Packed up our luggage and checked out of our hotel.  Hiked to the train station and caught the train for Edinburgh.  The train stations in Scotland are wonderful as are the trains.  Everything seems new and modern and I was most impressed!  The scenery between Glasgow and Edinburgh was lovely and the trip seemed to go quickly.    Once in Edinburgh we got a taxi to our B&B's.  We had to stay at 2 different ones this time but they were a
