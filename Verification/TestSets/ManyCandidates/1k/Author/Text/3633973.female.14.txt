FUNNY STORY: On my last night in Chicago, i stayed at my aunt and uncle's house, and they have a big golden retriever named Bailey.  Bailey is really nice, but so god damn energetic.  ANYWAYS. That night i went to sleep and i closed my door like usual, cuz i dont like to have it open when i sleep (yea...) and some-freaking-how, Bailey opened the door (did i mention he (yes, he.  bailey is NOT a boys name) is smart?) to my room in the middle of the night, took out two pairs of my underwear (new too, how SAD) from my opened suitcase, and proceeded to chew the living (well, not really) daylights out of them.  So i woke up yesterday morning, went to take a shower, opened the bathroom door, and what do i find?  guess.  Well, if you guessed my dead underwear, u were right.  Lying o-so-lifelessly on the floor of the bathroom.  rip pretty new underwear.  HAH.
i am home.  yay.  Chicago - family sucked; made me miserable.  But shopping was good.  Saw the Blue Man Group, 4th row seating; awesome.  yes.  Just found out im working next on Friday at 7, so u should show up.  i kno im working on fourth of july, but i dont kno whether itll be at the afternoon game of the evening one.  hope the afternoon one!  home hasn't been a whirlwing of excitement quite yet. gotta say, hate how everyone, well a lot of ppl, r doing ss.  it sucks.  i think i'll go running soon.  get in shape, lol.  well, ttyl.  btw, roger, 1984? wth?
i am in the big ol' windy city of C-H-I-C-A-G-O.  What a blast!  not.  but it isnt so bad.  Yesterday i went shopping down the big fancy (not really) magnificent mile (a.k.a. downtown)  I got a cartigan and shirt.  like u care.  yup.  And Colleen, i was encompased in retro wow i will take pics for u not to worry.  Last night i went clubbing (HAH, no) to the bar/teeny club (lol loud music n dancing and drinks and all that fun stuff haha) with my bro and sis and cuzes.  Fun stuff.  I just got finished running on a treadmill for 30 minutos, so i am POOPED.  AnD, my internet time is up right now.  well, i really could go as long as i want (i love charging stuff to whoever (whomever?) is paying for the room)BUt ive gotta go get ready to go eat n go to the taste of chicago and FERRIS WHEEL (yes, i bet u are all bubbling with jealousy right now) well, ttyl.  love ya.  leave a post, or gimme up a call cuz i love u.  buhbye
Well, actually it's not very short, but that's cool.  The lady at the haircutting place gave me 7Up.   It was good.  Colleen has the fab, fab, fabulous idea of a bbq and formal with the crew.  what fun we will hae such a blast.  I was gonna go to the crabs game aqui, but colleen backed out, danielle backed out, alex backed out, jackie backed out, and laura backed out.  what losers (wow, JOKING.  i love you.) I tought Roger how to properly play mancala, and of course, he caught on and decided, correctly, that my way was better.  CHICAGO TOMORROW.  Ill try to find some internet cafe to log on to, we'll see.  My parents promised me a comp, preferably laptop, "by the time i got to hs" but of course, NO COMPUTER IS PRESENT FOR MUA.  Wow, i cannot wait to hang out with my sister and her boyfriend.  Yea.  Right.
WHAT FUN.  Today i venturued over to Crayzbaby's casa and we partayed it up.  THERE WAS AN ICE CREAM TRUCK (truly, i did not know those still existed) and it was driving by and i went out and flopped my arms and i got its attention and boy, did we get ice cream! then we watched Bend It Liek Bekhman. It was good! but i bet all of you out there have already seen it.  well GUESS WHAT.  im just a little slow, OKAY?  Juicy juicy mangos.  THE JAW.  wow, what fun.  im tired, but im not gonna go to bed, because, for all of you out there who realyl care, i am talking to my friend in San Louis Opisbo about coming to visit and taking the trolley.  yes, TROLLLEY.  I think Arcata should get a trolley.  that would be THE BEST.  What great fun.  I think i say that a lot.  what fun.  well, leave a comment and when i see you i will give you a great big hug.
