I went to see this movie with work today.  It was really good.  I didn't know too much about it going on, but I was very impressed, definitely recommend it.
I went to test drive the CR-V yesterday at Bellevue Honda, since they had some manuals in stock.  I liked the way it drove, shifting seemed a bit more comfortable than the Rav4.  Other nice features: floor space next to the driver's seat (if you fold down the tray that's there), reclining rear seats.  Not so nice features: ABS only comes on the EX model (the more expensive one).  Funny quote from the dealer: "We're the biggest Honda dealership in the Northwest, and what that means for you is that you get a bigger selection." Evidently, it doesn mean I'd get a better price there.  Still undecided
I'm getting a new car soon.  I'm pretty sure it's going to be one of these three:    Honda CR-V    Toyota Rav4    Subaru Forrester  After the first one showed up on  urlLink  Google Images  , I thought it would be funny to use all crash test pictures.  But I couldn't find a picture of a crash test for the Forrester.  Maybe the internet is trying to tell me something (other than that I have a strange sense of humor).
I'm afraid I'm going to get some cavities.  Well I'm not really afraid, but I have been eating a bunch of candy.  "Why is that?" you might ask.  Well there are two factors here.  The first is that at work, people leave candy outside their office on the anniversary of their start date (typically 1 pound of m&m's per year they've been here).  The second factor is that my office is very close to the corner of this building.  Implications of being near the corner: There's a guy in a corner office with 8 pounds of candy outside his office, and hardly anyone ever walks by that part of the building.  So I've been handfuls of runts every once in a while for the last couple days.  They're good, but I know they're rotting my teeth.
As I mentioned I was going to do, I went to a smallish concert this saturday night to see The Killers.  It was at  urlLink  Neumo's  on Capitol Hill (10th & E. Pike).  The venue was cool, it's got a bit open area in front of the stage, then a bar off to the side, and a big balcony with some lounge-ish booths.  We were on the balcony, just above stage right so we had a great view.  I speculate that bands hire terrible opening acts in order to make themselves look better.  The opening acts were Cobra High (which falls under "good music for people who like bad music") and Alien Crime Syndicate (they weren't that terrible, but following Cobra High helped their image), whose lead singer was a Kurt Cobain wannabee.  The Killers were awesome, their lead singer is really good.  Robin said he sings like Clay Aiken (in terms of how he presents himself on stage, he's very casual, sort of walking around and playing to the crowd).  I hadn't really heard much of their other music, but it was all good.  They ended the set with 'Somebody Told Me', their hit single, then came back for a short encore.
I really like this banner:  urlLink       However I think it would be slightly classier without the translation.
Last night I went on a fun adventure.  First a little backstory is necessary. I really like this song called "Somebody Told Me" by a band called The Killers.  It is played on the radio here a lot, you can listen to it here:  urlLink  Killers Music  . Turns out The Killers are playing a small show in Seattle this Saturday at a club called Neumo's.  Tickets are only $10, but there's a $3.50 "[in]convience" charge if you buy them online.  So I had the brilliant idea that we should go buy tickets at the box office, and combine it with having dinner somewhere in Seattle. It should now be obvious that "fun adventure" was meant ironically as this barely qualifies as adventureous (though we did go to two places we hadn't been before). So  urlLink Scott ,  urlLink Erin , Adele, Luke and I went to dinner as T.S. McHugh's, an Irish pub in Queen Anne.  We picked it more or less at random off the list of restaurants that take the Prime Card.  Then we dropped Luke off (he lives in Seattle and took the bus to work) and went to get tickets.  Neumo's uses the Bad Juju Lounge as their ticket office, which seems really strange.  Tragically, they didn't have any tickets left.  I think they only allocate a certain # to be sold at the "ticket office" and the rest are available online.  What a ripoff.  So long story short, I ended up getting the tickets online anyways.  But at least we had a fun adventure.
Barring unforeseen circumstances, this is what I'll be doing on Labor Day:  urlLink  Super jock'n jill Half Marathon
Here are a few pictures from a small party I had at my apartment last weekend.
Here's a little known fact about me.  When I am outside running, I really enjoy seeing people that I know.  The most common scenario is to see someone I know driving by in a car, but occasionally I'll see someone walking, running, biking, etc.  I was reminded of this yesterday as I was running along West Lake Sammamish and saw Jason drive by.  That reminded me of two things.  The first thing is this interesting fact that I'm currently writing about.  The other, is that this now happens to me considerably less than it used to before I moved here.  That makes sense, considering I know a lot more people in Somerville than I do in Redmond. I'm now thinking that perhaps this interesting fact doesn't sound so interesting, probably because of the mundane way in which I phrased it.  It's hard to explain, you might say I "get a kick out of it" o
