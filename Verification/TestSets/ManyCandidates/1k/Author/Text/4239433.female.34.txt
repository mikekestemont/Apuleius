I am in lovely Castellina di Chianti now, having also woken up early (7:30 am, a half-hour before my adjusted wake-up call!) and caught the early train to Florence.  (On the way, I finished Dario's book about his tour experiences, which I even read for a bit after we hung up last night . . . have emailed him re a tour for me and am hoping to hear from him today!  I am even willing to change my Florence plans if necessary, as I think that a tour of this area with a true local would be unforgettable.)     From Firenze, I connected to a train to CdC--actually, as CdC does not have its very own train station, landed in the nearest Dia-forsaken (see, "Sex and the City" CAN be educational!) place with only one bus a day, which was not to depart for CdC until 2pm (it was then Noon and hot as could be).  Was feeling slightly desperate (not to mention sweaty) when I happened upon the kindest inn operator ever . . . he called a (more accurately, "the") cab for me, as I had another 10 kilometres to go to this town, and invited me to share his air conditioning while I waited.  I could have hugged him, he was SO nice.  Next, I nearly lost my life in the taxi due to high speeds, narrow roads and tight curves, but I guess there are worse ways to go than gazing out at beautiful vineyards in Tuscany.  :)   Upon arriving safely in CdC (to my great surprise), I found that my hotel room here is embarassingly spacious and decadent . . . as it turns out, this is the one that is 140Euros, while yesterday's was a bargain at 80Euros (a fact I learned at checkout).  This room's view is also beautiful and there is a garden with cushioned deck chairs below that I may have to experience before my departure.  The room is huge, with stuccoed walls, wood beams on the ceiling, a huge writing desk at which one could certainly write a book if one wanted to do such a thing, a sitting area with 2 (2!) small couches and an earth-sized bed.   I have already explored most of the town and eaten at the best restaurant so far of my visit . . . the tomatoes in my mozarrella and tomato salad were so perfectly red and luscious that I almost had tears in my eyes upon seeing and tasting them.  Is that the sign of a food explorer gone over the edge?  I adored my waiter, whom I permitted to choose my entire meal for me except the salad . . . he did not let me down, as the chianti (a San Leonardio?) was lovely and the ravioli with local truffles exquisite.  We are now fast friends and I think I may even return there for dinner.
I am in lovely Cortona today . . . it felt significantly less friendly than Orvieto until I had lunch, which was delightful (see below).  My arrival involved the as-yet not experienced on this trip "Lisa moment" in which I boarded a bus from the train station to the hotel (trying for once to be frugal and save the cost of a taxi), only to learn that my very fat suitcase would not fit through the narrow aisle.  I learned new things about the strength one acquires in an emergency situation as I had to lift the thing over a few seats so that an old lady could leave the bus.  Then I had to de-board myself in order to procure a ticket from the newspaper stand!  All of this was under the watchful yet unsympathetic eye of a curmudgeonly bus driver.  Ugh.     On the bright side, I arrived safely and my hotel room is exquisite, or at least the view is . . . a sweeping view of the valley below from a balcony onto which wood framed glass doors open.  It is breathtaking!  I also love my room, which is like a little jewel box and even has a built-in wooden armoire that reminds me of a ship for some reason (I'm not sure why, as I have never taken a cruise).  Also, the hotel has a lovely patio downstairs with a similarly splendid view, from which I plan to watch the sunset with a glass (or two) of wine.   Anyway, lunch was at a place near the local theatre (in which this internet place, strangely enough, is located, along with a pool hall), and I had nice German and American lunch companions, one of whom had a small dog in a carrier that reminded me of my law school roommate's dog.  (One thing to know about me on lengthier trips is that I go through extreme missing of my own dogs, which translates into me trying to pet nearly every dog that I see).  For the first time, I tried a local white wine (it seemed appropriate, given the warm and sunny weather), which was excellent.  This was accompanied by a nice tomato/mozzarella salad and thin pasta noodles with bits of duck woven in (you may be detecting a theme here . . . )  I also saw the largest pepper grinder ever . . . it must have been 3 feet long--yes, it's true!  Additionally, a waitress there had the most jarring yet infectious laugh I have ever heard!   Now I am off to some museums, although I am really in the mood to while away the day in a comfortable chair, gazing out at the view and soaking up the sun.  (I now am well on my way to being a tanned blonde from Tejas!).  So I will probably keep the museum visits fairly brief.  Will have to update you later on my yesterday, which was spent in lovely Orvieto . . . a wonderful place!   Arrivederci!
