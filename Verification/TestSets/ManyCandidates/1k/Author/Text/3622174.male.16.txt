Instead of having the bagel.tech War over WinAmp and jetAudio today, I'm going to share my thoughts about Spiderman 2: The Game.  I picked it up for my Xbox today, and the game is so much fun, that I don't think I've had this kind of experience in a game.  This game really is that good.  Of course, you play the calm, quiet Peter Parker...wait, calm?  Quiet?  Eh...I think I misjudged.  Peter is always out and about, skipping classes, ditching his friends, for one main purpose.  And that is to save New York City from villains, crooks, and bad guys.  The game is broken up into several "chapters," in which you must complete.  In each chapter are goals that you must accomplish to complete the chapter.  The goals may be challenging at some time (like the Rhino boss...he took me 4 tries or so to get him finished), but, let me tell you, it's all worth it.  This has to be the best Xbox game I have played in such a long time.  It's perfect for anyone who has ever seen either the first or second movies.    The graphics in the game are beautiful.  Activision decided to make this one with open ended game play, so that you can sling all around New York City.  And, New York City, by the way, has been very well recreated, with the Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building, and even two beams of light at Ground Zero.  It looks so much like the real city, that you won't know you're playing a videogame.  Its that much fun.  Slinging around has never been better.  You can select either Easy Slinging or Normal Slinging.  Normal is the better option to go with if you want the full experience of the game.  You can sling from building to building, rooftop to rooftop, and have as much fun as you want.  It sure beats traveling on foot, right?    So anyway, I've only come across the first boss at this point, but, as I continue to play it, I'm going to come across much more, and I know they are going to be very tough.  Stick around, because this Saturday, I'll be giving a full review. ------------------ Daily Wrap Up- June 30, 2004  Well, that's it for today's installments of bagel.tech.  I deviated from the original plan quite a bit, but, it was definitely worth it.  Here's what happened today:  In games I looked at Collapse.  This game is addicting, and it may give you Clickeritis, but, it's one of the most fun games I have played.  I gave Collapse an 87.5 (on the new scale).  For today's download, we looked at WinAmp 5.1.  This media player is nice, and it's got some sweet features, like being able to download skins that make the original look like a load of crap.  I gave WinAmp an 87.5.  And, today's site of the day, also earned an 87.5, and that is a site known as IGN.  User interaction is what makes this site great, you can post your game collection, wishlist, and all sorts of stuff.  Again, it got an 87.5.  So, we didn't look at the best of things today, but, it was still a good day.  Here's what to expect tomorrow...and remember, it can change:  GAME: What Word? DOWNLOAD: Avant Browser SITE: TBA FEATURE: bagel.tech WAR: WinAmp vs. jetAudio  Remember, the new rating scale begins tomorrow, and the monthly review archive is going to be deleted and started fresh for the new month.  That's it for today's installments.  Remember to check out Blog of Bagel tonight, where I'll be beginning the countdown for my favorite Family Guy episodes, and another update which will have me rambling about my new favorite game.  Until then, leave me alone!  I'm playing Spiderman 2!
The Lowdown:  Well, I said I was going to post 1up.com as today's site, but their new design isn't working all that great, so I'm going to pass on that until they make it work a little better.  So, today's site of the day is IGN, one of the biggest freakin' media sites on the internet today.  IGN stands for Imagine Games Network, but, they're not games anymore...they're games, movies, TV, music, and pretty much everything that the media has to offer today.  It offers a lot of user interaction, including the feature where you can post your game collection, and all sorts of stuff.  It's awesome, but, IGN may have its problems.  IGN has some of the best reviews for games.  Everytime someone reviews a videogame, and people don't agree with the review, they go to IGN to get the real scoop.  They have talented editors who take time and effort into producing quality news, reviews, and more.  The site design looks nice, and the whole thing looks professional, and that is what I like most about it.  If you want to take advantages of features like creating your own game collection, you have to sign up.  It's easy, its free (if you want a basic membership, that is), and it's worth it.  You can post your whole game collection, give them little reviews, and create a wishlist for games that you're looking forward to.  They also tell you how much your collection is worth.  You can write up reader reviews, and do all sorts of stuff.  It's really unique, and it's so easy to do.  IGN is one of the best gaming sites, hands down.  Check back for tomorrow's site of the day, because we're going to check out another, called GameSpot.      Pros  +Create a game collection, wishlist, and reader reviews +Covers more than just games, including movies, music, etc. +Owns a lot of big sites, like GameFAQs, Rotten Tomatoes, and GameSpy.   Cons  -People on the message boards are stupid.    Score  Fun Factor: 4/5 (80%) Graphics/Layout: 5/5 (100%) Speed: 3.5/5 (70%) Customization/Controls: 5/5 (100%) Final: 4.5/5 (87.5 exact)  Up Next...jetAudio vs. WinAmp in the first ever bagel.tech War!  Also, today's daily wrap up.
The Lowdown:  WinAmp is back, and it comes with an all new look for those p
