There's a song by Evanescence, Tournequet... And I'm commenting on it because I feel it describes my faith life...  I tried to kill the pain But only brought more ~ my human nature tends to make me forget faith and just control... which usually gets me in deeper crap than I was in originally.  I lay dying and I'm pouring crimson regret and betrayal I'm dying praying bleeding and screaming am I too lost to be saved am I too lost? ~ I think about this a lot- the things I've done in my life, am I too far gone to be saved... I never understood how some christians can say no matter what, they're saved and going to heaven. That to me is carte blanche to live a hedonistic life and at the end of the day say "oops! I'm sorry"... now let me in the gates"... there has to be some reprocussions in the next life that are a result of what you've done... and at what point (if any) are you just so lost that you can't be saved?  Do you remember me Lost for so long Will you be on the other side Or will you forget me ~ Another question I have... what will I see on the other side? Will I see the diety I hold as my Saviour (which is Jesus Christ... my personal belief)? How long do I have to wait in the train station of purgetory? Or even worse, will I be completely cut off in hell?  My God, my tournequet Return to me salvation My God, My Tournequet Return to me Salvation My wounds cry for the grave My soul cries for deliverance Will I be denied Christ Tourniquet My suicide ~ The confusion I feel about what I've done (my wounds), make me so guilt ridden that I do want that part of my life to die, but my infantile faith (soul) wants to rest comfortably in that I will be delivered from the maelstrom.
Body issues. All women (yes, ladies, ALL) have some sort of issue with their body at one point. I'm a big girl, no doubt about that... and I'm fully aware of the fact that just because an article of clothing is in your size doesn't mean it FITS. However, I've been indirectly taught from a very early age that I'm abnormal because I carry much more flesh than most... my mom and sister are small women... but I'm built (and look like) my dad. To spare you (and myself, somewhat) from this becoming a woe-is-me-I-don't-want- to- be- fat- anymore sob story, let's just say that yes, I want to loose weight. I have absolutely no intention of being THIN... I'm simply not built to be- but I want to be healthy... I may have perfect blood pressure and no diabetes or thyroid syndromes, BUT, I may in the future. I think that explains my borderline (read: just shy of stalking) obsession with Anna Nicole, Marilyn Monroe and Kelly Clarkson. These women were (are) not THIN, but they have beautiful, fully functioning, healthy bodies. Especially Anna Nicole. Granted, I'm not in the financial position to shell out $18 every 15 days for Trim Spa, hire a personal trainer and nutritionist... lord knows I wouldn't still be big if I did. I can't hate on Anna because she's endured a lot of stuff since her late husband died. But IMHO, the 88 year old geezer knew what he was getting into with her... she would be with him for financial stablity and little more. Anyway, she had to be ridiculed in the press for anyone to pay attention. I remember reading a particular diatribe that stated that she was a waste of a great beauty (paraphrased). What in the world?! If I have a pretty face, am I WASTING it being big?  Marilyn Monroe- By far the most recognized beauty of this century. Ask anyone in my generation who Ursela Andress or Raquel Welch were and you may get a blank stare until you mention the movies they were in (Dr. No and 1 Million Years BC, respectively). But say the name Marilyn Monroe and everyone knows. I personally have never met anyone that didn't think she was the epitome of sex and beauty. I was reading another blog (which was an "I'm fat self pity party") that argued that Marilyn was a size 12, which translates to a 16 now [not true- her measurements were 37-23-36, roughly a medium, size 8/10 on Victoria's Secrets site] but I think the bigger point is that she wasn't thin, but everyone wanted/would want a piece of her.  Now, contemporary to my generation- Kelly Clarkson. I was so pissed off when Simon Cowell(sp?) said she needed to loose weight because she didn't look like a pop star. The woman is a size 10, at most? If I get down to a size that small, do believe I will be walking about as if I were the hottest thing since sliced bread. She seems to portray herself as confident in her size. Good for her.  Anyway, I know it seems I'm projecting my wishes on ideals of others, and perhaps I am, but I have no other place to look. Most of my friends haven't had to deal with weight (yet- wait until they pop a few out), or are big themselves. I gave up a long time ago on being a thin woman (ie Faith Hill), because I'm simply NOT a small framed person. I will always have meat on my bones... but sometimes damnit, I want to strut in a two piece without hearing snickers or whispered commentary...  I guess this is turning into self pity, so I'll leave on that note.
The scandal today brought about a thought.  I'm not completely agnostic.  I know there is a God, and my idea of God is a Christian view, however, I have an issue with churches... CHURCHES, not God.  There's a diffrerence.   I've spent the past while searching for a church.  T
