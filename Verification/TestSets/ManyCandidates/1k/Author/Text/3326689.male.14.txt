May 24, 2004  Players will be glad to hear that today we have expanded our RuneScape hiscores list to show the top 500,000 players in every skill. We have made this change as the competition was getting extremely fierce for a place in the hiscores in certain stats. You now have a greater chance of being able to see how you rank against your friends and enemies in your favourite skill!
May 21, 2004  We have recently upgraded our UK PayBySMS Telebilling service.  Please note that when sending an SMS to subscribe using PayBySMS in the UK, you should now send to the new shortcode 89118.   Thanks,   RuneScape Billing Support
May 18, 2004  City life doesn't suit everyone, which is why Rantz and the rest of his ogre family have set up residence on the east coast in a cosy little cave with a nice view of the sea. However, independence comes at a cost. There's no more easy meals for the family and they currently have a hankering for Chompy Bird, a favourite delicacy of ogres.  Rantz is keen to start the Chompy Bird hunting season, but can't get started. He's all fingers and thumbs when it comes to making ogre arrows for his huge ogre bow. Is there someone kind and experienced enough with fletching to go help him and his starving family? Find out if you have what it takes in our new Big Chompy Bird Hunting Quest!
June 29, 2004  Oops, it seems the friendlist server has run out of memory. I'm working on increasing the memory allocation now.  If you login at the moment your friendlist will appear empty, but don't worry it hasn't been lost, the server is just offline and will be back very shortly.
June 29, 2004  We've added a couple of new options to make it easier to keep the contents of your bank arranged. (if you want to.)  1) At the bottom of the bank screen you will see 2 new buttons marked 'insert' and 'swap'.   'Swap' mode is the mode you are used to, whereby when an item is dragged to a new slot it swaps places with the item already there. This works exactly the same way as before.   'Insert' mode is a new option. In this mode dragging an item to a new position causes it to be inserted at that point, and everything else is moved up one space to make room. This is useful for instance if you get a new rune, and you want to place it next to your existing runes without having to manually move everything else.   2) It is now easier to move items a long way across your bank. Now if you drag an item to the top or bottom of the bank window, the window will automatically scroll up or down for you. This makes it much easier to move items several rows at a time. (note: this particular feature has actually been online for about a week now, but wasn't mentioned before so is here for completeness.)
June 29, 2004  King Roald of Varrock has recently found communications with the Temple guarding the Eastern border of Misthalin have been abruptly cut off. Anxious that something may have happened to his close friend Drezel, he is seeking volunteers to go forth and discover what the problem may be.  Those in search of adventure should make their way to see King Roald in Varrock palace immediately, to set forth on the Priest In Peril quest!

June 28, 2004  Today's update makes a variety of small improvements to RuneScape.    Bigger friends list for members!  As a new members benefit, you now get twice as much space on your friend-list. Giving you a total of 200 slots.    Multiple hit-splats during combat.  If a player or monster is being attacked by multiple opponents, or is taking damage very rapidly, the game will now show multiple damage indicators at once. This makes it much easier to see how much damage is being dealt. Note: the total damage received is the same, it's just shown more clearly now.    Npcs better at retreating.  We've improved the intelligence of the npcs a bit, such that if they are being attacked from beyond the edge of their wander zone, they will run away rather than just standing there stupidly.    Music+sounds work on more machines.  We've found why the music+sounds sometimes wasn't working when you select the SUN java plugin. We're still working on reaching 100% comptability, but a few more people should find it works for them now.    Fixed dragon-spear special attack.  We've fixed the bug which meant attacking a player with the dragon-spear special attack didn't give a pk-skull in the wilderness.
June 24, 2004  We are doing some essential maintenance to our servers today, which will mean that the servers are unavailable for a short time this afternoon.   We will have the work finished ASAP and everyone will be able to rejoin the servers very soon.
June 24, 2004  The number of people playing RuneScape is still increasing rapidly, with a record 36,000 simultaneous players last night.  To help cope with all these new players we've added another 3 game worlds. Due to popular demand we've put some of the new ones in the UK this time.   The new servers a
