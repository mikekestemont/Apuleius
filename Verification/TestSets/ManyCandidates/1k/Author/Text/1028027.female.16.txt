OK here goes nothing, I'm starting over. My old online journal is no more, I have a new address, I'll ahve a new look, more links, a profile, pictures and all that lovely stuff not to mention a knew look on myself. Ok so this is how I'm going to start out, so far this is my first year of High School at Abe. It's great minus a bitchy drama teacher. I have found a new guy to call my own, almost and this time he doesnt live in a different provence. Exsept I'm not sure how its working out, sometimes i love to think hes totally in love with me, but something show otherwise. Jared seems to be now out of the picture. Hes off girl searching and he already has two trying to go after him. I think he's overly enjoying it but hey, its not my job to judge, its his life. Jon's girlfriend Kristen haha.. she kissed him yesterday and hes overly happy which is great, Jon needs to be happy and someone to look forward to seeing. I guess its the same with Jared although, he seems content with or without someone. Danielle, my best friend, well she has had guys all over her as well and now is dating a guy named Jeremy and she seems exsteamly happy which is great. Me as a whole I've been bored as hell. The phone never rings for me, the guy i like is too busy and has let me down more then once, I get my homework done in hours my tests are going great I love my english class. I have no one to call and well... thats it. Everyday I have no choice but to sit around and think, usually I'm fine with that, but I dont have anything to think aobut anymore. I just can sit staring at the wall untill its like 9 or 10 so i can go watch a good tv show. This week I dont have much planned as of yet. I have a band consert and that should be good and its my first real consert for choir as well. Also mom asked me to go to work with her on the 5th for a take ur childern to work day but... she told me that i shouldn't go because it would be a waste of my day. which is almost a laugh .. lol cause i have nothing to waste. next semester im going to be so busy tho so i guess i shouldnt complain ... this is my break.. so i dunno.. i hope i do ok.... anyway i guess thats it.. so goodnite everyone  MOOD: Bored...   MUSIC: Staind - So Far Away
CATCH UP TIME   OK! well, the last few days have been lightly more interesting then before. I'm starting to read To Kill A Mockingbird in English which is cool, cause I've heard its a good book, of course others hate it, but oh well it gives me something to do.   The guy I liked he well, told me not to call him anymore. Thats the last I've heard from him and really, I'm ok with it, I had a feeling it was going no where and I heard he likes some other chick so I'm fine.   I went to the dentist yesterday, I found out in december they are going to put me to sleep cut my gums open chop my wisdom teeth into 3 bits and then pull it out peice my peice.. to all four of them.. so naturally i'm... scared to death!!! .  On a lighter note, lets see, miss oboe lady, the one that stalks me and is into everything that i am, and does better then me in everything and talks to much and is really ugly, WELL it turns out i kick her ass in singing... which is of course no doubt, but FINALLY the drama teacher put her down for once and not me and it was sweet revenge... and I was happy. I also got a 90 on my poem i presented and im awesome.  As for my music.. GOOD all GOOD ... umm I got Jared ( my ex)'s birthday gift ... and its music notes for piano guitar and vocal so im soo happy... I'll be playing it forever... and so far that is it for my life....   so I will let u guys know anything else interesting that turns up in my life....   MOOD:  Content   Song:  Still Staind :P - So far away
ACHIEVEMENT?   Ok so my goal was to stay alone today, take a book and think, relax, avoide all human contact. Well I woke up this morning, go everything ready, made sure I had my new book "About the Author", My song writing book and my cd's. So i walk down to the bus stop alittle later so i would miss the early 20, because i know for a fact Danielle takes that bus.  (ps: Aside from my hate for most of my friends at this point I am also very mad at Danielle for yelling at me last night, on how i told Fred (her ex) she had a new bf.. which i dont even recall anyway) I'm almost at the lights where i cross the street to the stop and the 20 roles on by.. being the smart one that i am i dont run to the bus knowing there will be a 73 coming down the same way that takes me to the same stop in about ten minutes.  I slowly trudge along, but when i get to the lights, i notice, Danielle had gotten off the 20... that right she got right off of it   "WHY?"   I'm asking my self as i mouth the word "shit" I cross the street and go up to tlak to her.. it turns out she saw me walking and got off... just to talk to me... and tell me how sorry she is for being a bitch yesterday...  haha if only she c
