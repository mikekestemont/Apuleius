Day 31 on the campaign trail and the gloves have been off now for a while and I think that any of the gimmicks used by the leaders to lure the fence-sitters like myself to their side will start getting iconic to a degree representing stiffness in the larynx of the throat.  Whoops!  That one slipped.  Oh!  Did it?  Uh, no.  YES!  YES!  He's a pedophile.  A whore.  A dumb servant with little feet and a slanted smile.  Okay.  Responsible for the deaths of all the homeless as Jack Layton has suggested of Paul Martin?  An advocate to child pornography as Stephen Harper has laid wrath on Martin, as well?  We cannot be that stupid.  That may work for individuals who are so persuaded by the  urlLink War-of-the-Worlds Syndrome , but we are  urlLink educated individuals!  And, just to make sure that this stays the course - and in timely fashion as well - Liberal Education Minister for Ontario, Parkdale-High Park MPP Gerard Kennedy, has announced that his government  urlLink plans to quadruple the number of teachers who specialize in reading and writing â€” from 4,000 to 16,000 .  This is a fantastic propostion, one that may heap some desire to stave off the wolves after a deadening roar stemming from a revearsal on a promise made by the ostrich-like Ontario Premier, Dalton McGuinty, and his much maligned healthcare premiums.  This, after promising during the provincial elections last year not to hike  anything.   Thanks and kippis!  A toast to the mid- to upper-class of our society who will have to pay for these premiums, right?    Thank the gods I'm below the poverty line.  I'm open to donations, though.  Just drop me a line.
Gidday'. Let's leave it to the politicians to make us feel this continual sense of ingrained fright and dislocation. The federal elections are in full swing, here, in Canada, with the English debates taking place last night on most major networks, a veritable sprawl of incense and the common adjectives (&quot;you should be so  bold ;&quot; &quot;you have no  credibility; &quot; &quot;liar, liar your pants are on fire...&quot;)used by the running mates is not glorified. I listened to it on  urlLink  CBCNewsworld    last night while looking for good radio frequencies online. I'd turn around to gaze, momentarily like a wussed-out cacklehead, looking for cookie crumbs and a cigarette, I'd see Prime Minister, Paul Martin, with an adversary as potentially volatile to Canada as Conservative party leader Stephen Harper lobbing sponsorship denunciations at the inculpable former Finance-Minister-turned-Prime-Minister. Gilles Duceppe and Jack Layton could only interject with loathsome goo and glaze over their own agendas.&nbsp; Now, this is all a little much if you hate politics, I know, but I'm going to hate having a Conservative PM. He will sidle up next to Georgie "Porgie" Bush and his fellow Texan neo-Conquistadors (even if the tyrant sits in office after the American November elections, Harper'll still want to go shopping at the  urlLink Wal-Mart's )and plea for better bargaining positions, thus limiting the pace in which we, as a distinct society, have worked so hard to wedge between the differences in our social practices compared to the feeding frenzy open markets of the United States of America. I don't know how well we're succeeding, here, but at least we have some independent media to talk about it, eh?  Canada's dailies   The Globe &amp; Mail   and   The National Post   both have their takes on things, even if they do print the same cover photo as   The Ottawa Sun  .&nbsp; Our pot legislation, abortion rights, and Quebec questions could become bleaker as well as social programs getting flung out the window.   Maybe, I just don't want a Canadian version of Bush.&nbsp; With home-wrecker Stephen Harper, though, and his conservative friends, it just may become that much easier to allow Quebec to slither off the map of Canada leaving me, as a de facto Quebecer sitting pretty in Ottawa wondering why, suddenly, my home province has now become another country.  I can imagine sparks igniting and other detrimental effects will occur.  It will make all our mouths sour, and we will wonder why we ever loosed them in the halls of Parliament in the first place?   Does Canada need this flavor?   Tomorrow, the  urlLink Ottawa Renegades  play their first home game of the 2004 regular season against the Winnipeg Bluebomber's.&nbsp; I am very excited.&nbsp;

Good to hear that the Renedegas do care about what's going on outside of town on the North.  Read the story of Head Coach Joe Paopao and other Ottawa Renegades players going up to Mistissinii, Quebec for a children's football camp.  Hopefully it will inspire Paopao to figure out how get his own brats to start playing some consitent wins.   urlLink "Cree nation to get guidance from Renegades"
At a time when documentaries are flourishing in numbers and all attributed towards exposing desperately needed facts and references of the most powerful social and political institutions in the world, checking out such films, as I have done in the recent past, should be just as important as picking up a novel by Mark Twain and Farley Mowat. It's very good to witness a movie by talented individuals- both in front and behind the camera, like Benicio Del Toro and Francis Ford Coppola. I want to listen to the best, too, like Pink Floyd and Trent Reznor. That's not so much to ask. I want to be entertained. I want to blow my freaking mind.  And I want to be able to see the truth.  Here's something interesting. Documentaries are now a marketable endeavour for do-it-yourselvers, and others skilful enough to just make a good film. Independent media at it's best. Now a form o
