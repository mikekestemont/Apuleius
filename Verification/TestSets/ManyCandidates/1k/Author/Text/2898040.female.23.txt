Ummm....okay?
The party went well, except for the fact that only 1 of my friends showed up. This was one hell of a depressing slap in the face. I realized not only that some friendship I thought would survive anything, were merely friendships of convenience and proximity. Also I realized that a lot of my friends aren't doing too well. I seem to be in the best circumstances of any of them.  When a few friends replied to my invitation with "I cannot afford to take saturday night off," I thought that they were being responsible. It has dawned on me recently that they were in a dire situation and could not possibly financially afford the $3 in train fare and roughly $10 in cab fare to come and visit me. I was talking to Chad a while back and he was describing how much he hates all 3 of his jobs and is still only scraping the bottom of the barrel. I feel like a terrible asshole when he asks how my job is going and I respond, "Great! I love it AND I'm rolling in dough." I don't want to rub my success in other people's faces.   I have had this conversation with a few other reasonably successful people and they claim that my friends are merely losers that cannot possibly succeed if they haven't done so by now. This became a hell of a fight. My friends are wonderful, brilliant, and deserving people that are kind of stuck in some rough times. But this begs the question: how is it that I see their brilliance, but the American workforce does not? I know incredible artists, writers, musicians, chefs, and unusually brainy cocktail waitresses. They are by no means losers in the field of social intelligence. So how could these talented people lack necessary skills?   I have thought long and hard about this and I have decided that the answer is both simple and complicated: complacency. Limited drive to take risks or to put oneself out there and challenge conventions. Maybe life circumstances haven't been so dire as to push these folks to move beyond bouncer to manager. They exist as simply okay. And although some of the friends I speak of were "vicinity" friends, I still worry about them. Such an untapped wealth of brilliance should not be going to waste such as it is.
So, tomorrow is the big party. Jay has been on my ass all week to help him plan the goofy thing. I'm thinking we just have a bunch of folks over to get drunk. In my past experiences, planning party activities and food selections never works out quite the way anyone hopes. The Twister is rumpled in the corner, the chips and dip are all over the floor, and you end up with an Uno set that seems to be missing a wild card or two. Why bother to cut out a coquet path in the lawn, when handing a bunch of drunks some heavy mallets is not the brightest idea I have ever heard.  I know I should be excited about my birthday, 23 is a lot farther than I thought I could ever make it. But I'm looking at my life and examining where I have been and where I had expected to be and 23 is, thus far, no great accomplishment. That's the problem with expectations, they never come out as you expect. Perhaps we should simply call "expectations", "wild guesses at what the future may hold, which may or may not come true but wouldn't it be nice if they did". Of course that is a bit of a mouthful but it expresses the feeling on expectations quite nicely. Aagrh...semantics.
You know, you'd think, taking into account the considerable amount of time I spend parked on the couch watching Law and Order, I would have more time to post. It's not a lack of inspiration so much as a lack of motivation.   It's been an eventful few months, between an arrest, weight gain and loss (and subsequent re-gain), sleeping with some more assorted idiots, and a new found understanding for why exactly I hate living in this country. I suppose that explains why I watch so much TV, I don't have to think about/over analyze/churn up ulcers over any of this stupid day-to-day crap. When I get sucked in to TV watching I also don't have enough motivation to get up and grab a beer, so my weekday booze consumption has gone down as well. Like I said, eventful.  I went out with my friend Mandie the other night and got blitzed. I got blitzed in a family restaurant. I got blitzed at my old place of employment. Christ, that's pathetic. Mandy drove me home, I vomited, I went to work the next day, I regretted getting plowed, I did it again the next night. Dammit. She's been working so hard on her self for the last several weeks and I am so proud of her, and yet so jealous of her dedication. I need to find some will power. I bet E-Bay has it, they have everything.  I was taken by a friend to a really wonderful samba show at the Hot House. It's a damn shame that I couldn't even enjoy the music because I was too drunk and nostalgic for when I could fit into a cute flippy salsa dress and wear belly shirts without standing up straight and sucking it in. Did I vow to do something about this? You bet...right before my first beer at 8am the next morning.  I have been fighting with Matt awfully often lately. I feel like he has decided to treat me like one of his idiot girlfriends, despite the fact that he yells "I CAN have a friendship with a girl and not sleep with her" to naysayers, in reference to me. The problem is, I think I am subconsciously playing into it. I can't stay mad at him for any reason, no matter how egregious the offense, no matter h
