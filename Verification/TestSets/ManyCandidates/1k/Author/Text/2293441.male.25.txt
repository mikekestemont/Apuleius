urlLink LAMP Lighter: The Apache Toolbox  by Rael Dornfest -- An overview of the Apache Toolbox, a Swiss army knife of a script, providing a customizable, menu-driven interface to downloading and compiling a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHPherlthon) -- minus the Linux -- installation.

AppAlarm(tm) is an application security tool that prevents unwanted processes and applications from running. Most adware and virus programs launch processes and applications without the user knowing, or even leave unwanted processes running in the background. Process Sniper detects the launch of all processes and applications and then prompts the user to determine if it is a process that should be run. Since AppAlarm(tm) loads before any other applications or services, any application can be prevented from running.   Visit     http://www.circleofone.com     to   download   the software.
Net has become a part of our daily life and many of us regularly visit a multitude of web sites/blogs and use several other Net services- web-based e-mail, on-line weather service and the like. A generic interface that helps us view the contents from our favourite sites without having to visit each one of them separately and that lets us access the various Net services directly from our browser would help us quite a lot. The free software, Surfpack (    http://www.surfpack.com    ), which can be used to assemble all your favourite services into a single web page, will be useful for building such an interface.       Surfpack, which comes with a ready-made web page equipped with many built in features allows you to edit the page's content (using the `Edit' option at the page header) in &quot;whatever way, form or shape you might like.'' That is, you can add/delete any number of service modules to be presented on the home page and get them displayed in any order you prefer. As the page lies on your desktop, it gets loaded very fast and you can access it anytime by loading the browser with the URL:     http://localhost:8171/    . One drawback of this software is that it works properly only with IE. As per its site (    http://www.surfpack.com/requirements.html    ), Surfpack's versions compatible with Mozilla and Opera are under development.
WinZip used to be the popular tool for compressing/archiving files. As it is not free now, once the evaluation period gets over, WinZip will start reminding you to register. Actually there is no need for you to suffer from such troubles as there are a few really free file compression programs (quite similar to WinZip) in place. The free `zip file manager,' ZipCentral, is one such tool that can be used to create/extract compressed file archives. For more details:     http://zipcentral.iscool.net/    .
VNC tools like RealVNC (     http://www.realvnc.com/     ) can be used to take full control of a remote PC over a network. But one drawback of this tool is that the process becomes slow, as a lot of data has to move from one machine to the other for transferring the desktop graphics. Instead of the complete desktop, if mouse/keyboard movements only are to be transferred, we can easily gain considerable performance advantage. This is what the VNC client, Win2VNC (    http://fredrik.hubbe.net/win2vnc.html    ) accomplishes. Install the `RealVNC' server on one machine, install the Win2VNC client on the other machine and set up the mouse movement direction, say, to the right. Once both programs are operational, whenever you want to move to the screen of the second machine (in which VNC server is running), move the mouse pointer beyond the right-edge of the current monitor- you w
