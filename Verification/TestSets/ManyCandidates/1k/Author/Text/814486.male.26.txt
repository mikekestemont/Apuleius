Just got a call back from the solicitors, and it looks like the buyer's solicitors are still waiting for the results of the local search... This means that at the earliest we'll be able to exchange next week, but more likely the following week! Not exactly going to plan, but then whatever does? Fingers crossed that I'll get a call tomorrow from the solicitors asking us to exchange there and then...
Another good thing about England: Mr Kipling's Almond Slices... Especially when Sainsbury's is offering a two for one deal ^_^
Still no news on the exchange date... Not good. I'll try and speak to the solicitors again today, they're not exactly easy to get hold of though. :-( If they've not rung by 11:00, I'll ring them then. It's so cool - only 27 days left! I can't wait... I can already smell the boulangerie (there's one about 50 metres down from where we'll be staying), taste the cousoucs and cassoulet, see the mountains and feel the salt and sand of the coast on my skin. It's almost as though my mind's already down there, and my body's just waiting to catch up! Still loads of things to sort out here though... and a lot of them we can't do until after we've exchanged. It's going to be wierd getting rid of our newish (a year old now) Peugeot 206, especially since it'll probably be a couple of months until we can afford to get another new car. It's funny how you get used to have such luxuries in life, and feel a little lost without them... I'm sure we'll manage, we lived for a year here without a car, so three weeks shouldn't be too hard. Besides, it's still warm, so biking to work will be nice, and should help get me back into shape (15km each way). Right, today I'm determined to get this Web Services demo working, so I can start to rebuild the way our webserver works - the last thing I want is that the person who takes over my job (eventually) looks in disgust at the state of things. I wish my boss would give me the go ahead for implementing the new web-site - it's a gorgeous application, and a management dream. Fingers crossed... I'll have a chat with him when he's back from holidays next week.

I was just wondering, after visiting the various news websites I visit every day, why Americans use the date format "Month Day, Year", i.e. August 21, 2002? I've noticed that they do it when speaking too, i.e. "It's being launched on August 21". Fair enough, I guess... I mean each to their own and all that, but it just doesn't seem to make any sense. In Europe, we'd say "It's being launched on the 21st of August", a short version of "the 21st day of August", but "August 21", as far as I can tell, doesn't actually mean anything. I suppose that stretching your imagination, you could deduce that it means "August's 21st day", but that's taking the Mickey, so to speak. Besides, from a purely usefulness point of view, especially on news websites, it's incredibly important to be able to order articles by date. If you've got a long list of articles, all dated "August XX, 2002", it's harder to order them than if you've got "XX August, 2002". It's a bit like putting the time in this format: "MM:HH:ss"... If news websites were to go that one step further, and put the date in the ISO format YYYY-MM-DD, that would make sense, especially when combined with the time in the format HH:MM:ss. Anyone got any interesting explanation for why Americans use that wierd date format...?
Another day, another rant... I saw The One (starring Jet Li) on DVD last night - great action movie, with some pretty well executed Matrix-like scenes. Certainly helped take my mind off The Mothman Prophecies, even though I was reminded of it while in bed reading Terry Pratchett's "The Truth": there was a line that read "HALF MAN, HALF MOTH"... Typical. Bit more optimistic today since I should be getting a confirmation that we'll exchange contracts this week. It's a little worrying that it's already Wednesday morning, and I've still not had a confirmation, but I'm hoping that the solicitors know what they're up to, and that it'll all be sorted by this afternoon. Ah yes, thanks to The Stone Monkey&trade; I've just remembered I should swap the backup tapes round before I get cracking with my "real" work...
Hmm. I might have been a bit harsh earlier, commenting on England... To be fair, it has it's own share of "good things": Marmite, Sky Digital, lots of decent games developers, Aston Martin (before it was bought out...), and some pretty original art. The motorways aren't bad either. Ah yes, some pretty good musical artists too.
A few seconds too late with an Alt-Tab, and you find yourself trying to explain what a sock monkey is, and above all what it is doing on my screen at work, to a passing colleague... Actually, speaking of monkeys (as you do...), I've got a small stone monkey on my desk. The reason for this is not that a furry cloth mascot was petrified but rather because it's my turn this week to change the daily backup tapes - the Stone Monkey On Desk&trade; is a bloody good way of remembering things. Makes a good paperweight, and - if absolutely needed - a handy weapon.

It's wierd - I just had an IT management meeting where there was a fair amount of planning going on for the future, but I'm not allowed to tell people her yet that I'm leaving... at least until next week. My boss, and some of the other directors know of course, but they don't want me telling my other colleagues until I'm absolutely sure that I'm leaving (even though I've g
