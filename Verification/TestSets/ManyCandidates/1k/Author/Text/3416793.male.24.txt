The excitement has been growing these past few weeks and I can hardly believe that it is already time to go.  There have been so many last minute details to takie care of that these past few days have felt a little hectic.  But by God's grace and the help of friends and family, things have fallen into place.  Now that my thoughts are no longer focused on the details here, they have turned to India and to Calcutta and to all that will happen there.  I am filled with anticipation for what God will do through us and for us during our time in India and I am thankful to have the support of friends and family back home and here in Omaha.  Let the adventure begin!
Dear friends and family,    After being here for one month, I've learned that living in Calcutta requires many things.  First you need athleticism and agility to make it across the street.  You also need long arms and a good sense of balance to remain standing on somewhat turbulent bus rides.  You also must have rather good lung capacity to avoid suffocation on those rather packed subway rides.  And one must have fearlessness for riding in auto-rickshaws.  But more than any of these things, Calcutta requires patience.      Just to be in Calcutta, for a westerner anyways, is uncomfortable.  It seems hot, crowded, and polluted.  But more than that, you are constantly made aware of suffering, whether it is the dying at Nimral Hriday, the severely handicapped children at Daya Dan, the beggars on the street or just the families that live on the street for lack of anywhere else to live.      I must confess my first instinct has been to flee - to run away and hide from it all.  I have spent many afternoons in a western style coffee shop just trying to get away.  And there are so many people vying for your attention while you walk down the street, that many times I have found myself blocking everything and everyone out.    But I believe that many times God calls us into uncomfortable places.  In fact, to be truly compassionate to those who suffer, we must enter into solidarity with them.  We must identify with them even to the point where their suffering becomes our suffering.  But to do this requires patience.  Patience to remain in the midst of suffering even when we have the means to run away and return to our own comfortable lives.    But God has been teaching me patience and that has been for me the first step towards true compassion.  Tomorrow we leave Calcutta for three weeks to travel south.  One week ago I was looking forward to getting out of Calcutta just to be away from it all, but today I found myself wishing to stay longer to be with the kids at Daya Dan.  But I am thankful that we will be back in Calcutta for 5 weeks before we head back to the states.  Please pray for us as we travel and visit Tammy's orphanage and the ashram.  Thank you for all your love and support.  ~Jonathan
Today I spent journaling and just processing all that has happened since arriving in Calcutta eight days ago.  These past eight days have not been without their difficulties.  But having the support of friends and family back home, as well as my fellow team members has been invaluable.   Poverty is so common here that it is easy to become calloused.  And there are so many beggars on the street that make a living of it.  Even young children who seem so desperate.  And after ignoring or saying no to people who seem so much in need - it is easy to lose compassion for the ones that truly are in need.   Volunteering has also been a little difficult this first week.  Mostly because I have not known what to do at the different homes...  And there have been so many volunteers that I have felt like more of a burden then a help.  But that should change as I find my place and learn the ropes at the different homes.   Right now I plan on volunteering at Daya Dan (a home for handicapped children) in the mornings, and at Kalighat (a home for the dying) in the afternoons.  At yet I am a little leary of developing deep relationships with the children at Daya Dan because I will be here for only a month and then gone a month and then back for only a month.  But I will do what I can.   I feel comfortable here in Calcutta although a couple of times I have gone on extended walks unintentionally :)  But I am seeing much more of the city than I would otherwise.  Today it was 99 degrees out and the humidity was almost as high.  But I am getting better at doing my laundry and it will be ok.   Please pray for the team - especially for team unity.  And pray that God would break my heart for the people here.  And also pray for Chris our team leader as he has had many things to deal with these first few weeks.  I love you all.  ~Jonathan
I have now been in India for four days and I seem to have recovered from the long trip here.  The trip here was a lot of fun and it was wonderful to see Vancouver and Hong Kong during some long layovers, but it did leave us all quite tired.  Wednesday we arrived in the morning and after cleaning the apartment and getting settled fell promptly asleep - for 9 hours or so.   Thursday we went for a tour of the city and visited Kalighat - the home for the dying.  And yesterday we went and visited the Mother house where Mother Teresa's tomb is located.  We attended a volunteer orientation and signed up to volunteer.  This morning we went and volunteered at a home for disabled children called Daya Dan.  We played with the children and took them t
