This was Daisy's idea - describe your perfect day, as is CURRENTLY POSSIBLE, in order to begin living that way. It's meant to be an exercise in deliberate living. When I wrote my perfect day, I sort of ignored that aspect of it, and wrote what my dream life would be like. It's very diet and fitness oriented, because that's where my head was (and is), but in general it's what I would consider an absolutely ideal day in a perfect universe:  Wake up at a reasonable time, not late and not crack-of-dawn.  Say 7:30.  Put on my bathing suit and walk out to the beach. Gather a few shells, breathe the sea air, have a little stroll, commune with nature. Jump in the water for a few minutes, to really wake up and clear my head. Back to the house, for coffee and a breakfast of fruit and seafood. Get dressed in a halter top and wrap-around skirt. Go to my studio for a few hours of creating masterpieces which sell for good prices to a small group of discriminating patrons. Walk to town and pick up some groceries. Have a giant salad with a glass of wine for a late lunch in a little cafe. Walk home. Read a good book for an hour, then lift weights for 30 minutes. Have a little nap and a shower with my beloved husband. Get dressed in something pretty and slinky, but no shoes. Make cocktails and hors d'oeuvres in my bright, colorful, funky kitchen, as my brilliant literary and artistic friends start dropping by in the early evening. Sit on the verandah drinking and talking, wolfing down canapes and bringing up epigrams. When we get hungry for dinner, whomp up a big batch of fresh seafood and pasta, open some wine, and stay up late talking and laughing and singing and dancing. Go for a midnight swim to clear our heads. Retire to my plush bedroom and write in my secret journal by candlelight. Tell all and name the names, for future publication. Go to bed and sleep deeply with pleasant dreams.
Naturally, make substitutions as you see fit. More vegetables would be nice!  4 largish zucchinis 2 14.5 oz cans of diced tomatoes (Italian flavored) 1 lb ground turkey 3/4 cup Italian flavored breadcrumbs 1 8 oz. package shredded no-fat mozzerella cheese 1 12 oz. jar red peppers some olive oil  Slice the zucchini longways into flat, 1/4" thick strips. Drizzle some olive oil on the bottom of a 9x12" pan. Arrange a layer of zucchini as you would lasagne noodles.  Mix the ground turkey and breadcrumbs. Spread half the mixture over the zucchini in the pan. Pour one can of tomatoes on top, and half the cheese.  Arrange another layer of zucchini, perpendicular to the bottom layer. Spread the remaining turkey on the zucchini. Add diced red peppers and the other can of tomatoes. Sprinkle the remaining cheese on top, and drizzle with a little more olive oil.   Cook at 325 for one hour (approximate - cook until zucchini is tender but not mushy).   For a single serving (about one-tenth of a 9x12 pan) I figure the nutritional values as:  Calories: 228.	Protein: 18	grams. Carbohydrates: 15 grams.	Fat: 9 grams.	Fiber: 2 grams.
As always, improvise as you see fit.  Dice a couple stalks of celery and a couple carrots. Heat up some olive oil in a large pot, and sautee them with a sprinkling of cumin and red pepper flakes. I don't know how long - ten minutes maybe, on a low heat.  In the meantime, dice up potatoes and whatever other vegetables you want to add - onion, zucchini, peppers, etc. When the celery and carrots have had enough of a head start, add the other vegetables, and also a splash of wine.   After a few minutes, worry that they are getting burned.  Add a large can of tomato juice and two small cans (14.5 oz) of diced tomatoes (Mexican flavored is good). Stir and throw in more seasonings - tabasco, more cumin, sage, whatever.  Simmer for maybe 20 minutes.  Add a handful of frozen corn. Chop up 2 pounds of catfish into large bites, add to the stew. The fish doesn't take long to cook, so put it in when you're pretty sure the rest of it is done.  Serve with cheese sprinkled on top.
Marla's Bean Salad  1 can garbanzo beans (15.5 oz) 1 can black beans 1 can blacked-eyed peas 1/2 cup diced onion 1 can chopped green chiles (4.5 oz) 10 green olives, diced 1 tbsp. lemon juice 1 tbsp. balsamic vinegar 1 tbsp. sesame oil  Pour the beans into a collander and rinse. Transfer to large bowl. Add the onion, chiles, and olives. Spritz with a large amount of lemon juice, sprinkle with balsamic vinegar and sesame oil to taste. Stir.  The last three ingredients are definitely "to taste," so I'm using 1 tablespoon as an average to figure out the calories. I probably use more lemon juice and less oil, but you DO need the sesame taste to complete it, so don't leave it out entirely.  Other ingredients I use (it just depends on what's in the pantry): black olives, celery, those  urlLink red peppers  in a jar, garlic, etc.  This makes about 6 cups, and I think a reasonable serving is 3/4 of a cup, eaten as a side dish. So the nutrition counts for one serving are approximately:  calories: 186 protein: 10 (grams) carbohydrate: 29 fat: 1.1 fiber: 8.6
I’ve put these in two groups, but they’re all worth watching. Where it was convenient to do so, I’ve listed some dates and actors and such, but haven’t invested the time to do it really thoroughly — IMDB does it better than I can. And I’m not writing giant reviews or analyses, just a sentence or two about why I like it. Maybe give you some ideas for the next time you’re trying to pick something out at Blockbuster.    Two Star movies.  Movies that I consider to be nearly perfect. They’re so well acted, or so i
