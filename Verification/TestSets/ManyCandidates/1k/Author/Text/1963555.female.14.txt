(NOTHING) Mood: FINE until now!  WTF! My mom just took away my Simple Plan cd because "I'm not being considerate" screw that! Now until "I learn my leason" or take it back I'm gonna be in a bitchy mood! but then again I just saw them in consert saturday and I still should be on the post-consert high so never mind all that! But ya know what I have an H2O cd down here anyways so I'll just pop that in instead! HAAAA HAAAAAAAA Mom! Anyway, If you guys are looking for a good band def. pick up H2O's Go. It's a great cd! Also Movielife is pretty good too (they both were @ the SkateFest)! So I forgot to tell you about one of the hottest things David did!! I couldn't belive me! at the end of the show he did his last note and threw up his bass and just let it slam on the stage! UGHHHHHH Awesome!!!! It was soooooooo hot!!! GOD!!!!!!!! I really love them even more than ever!!! UGHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!! Man it was soooooo fricken awesome! OHHHHHHHHHH! so yeah I still have 3 reports due like the 15th and I'm actually gonna work on them! WOW! so I'll talk to you sexy guys a little later! Ha HA! bye
OMFG!!!!! Today (as I said it would be) was the best fricken day of my life!!!!!!!! We went to the skate fest!!!! It was fucking awesome day!!!! we saw....... SIMPLE PLAN!!!!! they were on last though.... IT WAS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO worth the wait!!!!!! They were awesome!!! they preformed like their whole album!!!!!! THIS DAY FUCKEN ROCKED!!!!!  so David is really fucking hot! we all knew that but hey he's even hotter live! we were like in the back for a while and (by the way, my dad took me and dacia instead of my mom) I got sick of it and wanted to move ahead! so I just eventually ignored my dad and did what I wanted and it was soooooo worth it since I got so fucking close to Pierre and David!! but before then me and Dacia are sitting there and some punk chick walks up and was really close to dacia but she couldn't see her face. So when she walks away Dacia goes "OHHH was he hot?" and I'm like "No not at all it was a GIRL!" and she's like "OH, CRAP!" so I think she's offically swinging both ways if ya know what I mean! So I was like in talking didtance from David the whole time! My toes hurt and my legs from standing on my tippy toes for over an hour, it really sucks that I'm short!! so anyway on to the simple plan concert.... so David and them go on stage. Pierre's like "sorry it's so fucking late!" and Davids like "yeah I was, uh I was jerking off!" ha omfg!! I could have fainted! and so Pierre goes "hey it wouldn't of taken THAT long!" and David says "Well next time I'll just think about your mom!" lol OMFG!! It was great! I think my dad got a little uncomfortable though! then they preform a little which rocked!! they kicked ass!!! and then Pierre goes back to talking. He takes a big drink and says "oh this is horse piss!, my doctor said I had to drink it" and David's like "oh I've actually had that before! lemme have some" so he takes a huge gulp then goes over to a towel and spits it out! lol AWESOME!! then sometime around there Chuck it drummin and rocking so hard obvously he's tierd so he stepps out from the back of his drums and stands in the front and when pierre tells him to go back he's like no! it was so funny! Then he starts flipping off the crowd! AWESOME but then he goes all out and starts to "use provocitive hand gestures twards the croch and the mouth" and for those of you who have no imagination he pretended to jerk off in front of everyone! It was soooooo FUNNY!  So eventually it was time for them to go so they leave. BUTTTTTTTTT!!!! then we start yelling "one more show!" over and over rather than "oncore" we were kinda stupid! and Chuck comes out on stage and thanks us for being so "fucking awesome" and we're like yeah yeah we know and they ran out and preformed another song! so then they say this is a popular some and you here the drums start up and everything and it was........... 50 cent, "in da club" I know it might sound like I'm turning to rap and I"m not!!!!!!!! but it sounded so fucking awesome! It was all rock-ish!! UGH!!!!!!!! AWESOME!!!!!!  and somthing screwed up like the guitars or they forgot the lyrics and pierre like "uh... oh sorry about that how about this one....?" and they preformed "American Jesus"! awesome!!!!!! they also preformed "Crash and Burn" for only the second time for us!!! awesome song!!!! so they go off stage and pierre tells us he's doing autographs and to come check it out. now keep in mind they just preformed an hour and a half and it's twelve o'clock at night and their gonna push himself even more!!!??? awesome!!! so we hang out a bit and then my dads like "I don't wanna it's too late!" and I'm thinking no fucking way we're NOT getting their autographs I mean HELLO!!! so thier out by the tour bus (which I pointed out on the way in the consert! they could have seen me on the street before anyone else!!) so we run out and some people are bitchy!! I mean their doing YOU a favour not us to them you know!! talk about greedy! so I get my dad to get Daica's videocamera out of the truck and we filmed them for so long! It was awesome!!!!!!
