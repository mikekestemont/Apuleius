salsa dancing....  cafe se villa is the place to be on a thursday night if you wanna learn salsa. it never really interest me but i'm open to new things. so when my girlfriends suggested we go, i was in. it was pretty cool because they give you lessons before the dancing really begins. you know me...i'm a little shy but the atmosphere was so welcoming and friendly that dancing with strangers was natural.   here's the difference between a salsa dancer and a clubbin' guy: the salsa dancer is a lot more respecting...not trying to hit up on you, just wanting to salsa and teach you how. a clubbin' guy (not all)...will try to hit on you, grab your ass, caress your back, kiss your hand, pretend to trip onto you, eye you up and down in the most perverted way and if you turn him down, he moves right along to the next girl and does his routine all over again. that's just my personal observation and i'm sure many of you would agree.     anyway back to my story...salsa dancing is a lot of fun especially if you have a good partner. i was spinning, turning, twisting, dipping, smiling, and laughing...just having a great time. oh yeah and a lot of hip action is involved too. it was cool because you'd switch partners all night long. all the guys i danced with were hella good at salsa...they made me look good..haha me and my two left feet.   anyways, i think my clubbin' days are catching up to me. i have a bit of cold right now...sucks since i haven't been sick in almost 2 years. i must have jinxed myself some time ago. i'm sorry kim, i promise not to make fun of your everlasting cough ever again...please take it back...i don't want it!    it's friday again and i should be going to LA for antionette's birthday, the big two-three,  but i feel like shit and i have to move this weekend...i'll be homeless for a few days...anyone wanna take in a poor girl??? i'm a good roomie,really!!  well, i've been waiting all week to party in hollywood...damn, planning never works for me. i've been lucky so far but recently nothing seems to be going my way. oh well "whatever happens, happens for a reason"...ummmm...don't know what the reason is but hopefully i'll find out soon.
actions vs. words...  i'm a very strong believer that actions speak louder than words. but at one time in my life, i remember thinking why couldn't he express how he felt, why didn't he write me poetry or even letters, why was it so hard for him to tell me sweet nothings. in a way, i think i felt i was missing something because he didn't do any of  those things and with this mentality, our relationship went a rye.  and that was the beginning of the end.  it's been 9 1/2 months since we broke up. i know he was hurting alot and to this day, i still feel that he's bitter...not sure if that's a good word choice, but i still feel the anger and resentment that he still has for me everytime i see him.  when we broke up, i really felt that we could be great friends, that things wouldn't change because i considered him my best friend for so long but that didn't happen. when we broke up, i lost him, i lost my best friend...the one person who knew my in's and out's and at times believed knew me better than my own family. even though he had a hard time expressing himself, i knew he loved me with every cell in his body. i knew he would do anything for me,  i knew he would never break my heart. he's one of those rare guys out there that is actually good and what i mean by good is that he truly has a loving and trusting heart. not many out there. let's just say, whoever he may end up with is one lucky girl.   this whole experience has been a very painful one. i've learned a lot about people and have come to realize what i should have known 9 1/2 months ago. i've reached a point in my life where words mean absolutely nothing until they prove that they can deliver. people can tell you one thing and really mean something else, people can lie to your face, people can twist your words, people can just be simply heartless when they want something so bad that they would say anything to get it. shut up already...heard it before, don't need to hear it again. i use to want someone who could talk and express words easily but after knowing what i know, i rather have a mute then a broken record. my only conclusion to this is...stay away from chatter boxes..you know the ones that tell you  everything  you want to hear.
hmm....another way to look at it  "Simple Truths" by Kent Nerburn "It is a mystery why we fall in love. It is a mystery how it happens. It is a mystery when it comes. It is a mystery why some loves fail. You can analyze this mystery and look for reasons and causes, but you will never do any more than take the life out of the experience.   Love is more than the sum of the interests and attractions and commonalities that two people share. And just as life itself is a gift that comes and goes in its time, the coming of love must be taken as an unfathomable gift that cannot be questioned in its ways.  Too often, when love comes to people, they try to grasp the love and hold it to them, refusing to see that it is a gift freely given and a gift that just as freely moves away. When they fall out of love, or the person they love feels the spirit of love leaving, they try desperately to reclaim the love that is lost rather than accepting t
