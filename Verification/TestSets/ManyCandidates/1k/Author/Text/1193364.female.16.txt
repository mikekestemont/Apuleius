urlLink Pseudo Stars.   Oh that's my blog. Bookmark me, k? Well, I've got work to do mostly for Coach Waters. And some for Mrs. Heffner, and I'm sure that Mr.Huff gave me some work. But, oh well. You know? I'm such a slacker. But, I don't care all too much. Bah. Who does?  Well, for those of you that don't know I've been writing a lot of poems lately, and it's mainly because of personal reasons. Only like, well, three people that know those reason have read it, and two that don't. So, about five, without the family counting. w00t. I like it, but It will never be posted unless I'm totally sure no one reads this ever. Advisors tell me it seems to make me appear very bitter. Although, they deny it, I agree, I am bitter. And a bit jaded. But, hey, have you seen my art lately? Have you read my book lately? Being Jaded like this can rock some hard ass. I mean, oh well, I have issues with getting close to people now. They can really get over it. It's just hard, because I hardly have trust in people and the human race in general. Who cares though? It's my issue, I've got a couple, I'll deal. Everyone around me will deal. Bleh, so, screw you people that don't.   You all know I love you, for the most part. And I say for the most part because, I like half of you a lot more than you deserve. That's mainly because I know I get annoyed a lot quicker than I used to. but, I changed a lot, and so did everyone else, if you ask me. I won't list the ways, but they did. And I did. And I'm happy with the change! So nah!   Oh, Progress Reports. Let's not go there. Heck, I'm doing all right, but not as good as I should be. Ah, tainted playlist. Well, not as good as I should be, is like B-ish. And I have a 99 in art. Oh wow. Unexpected. I'm a terrible artist, but whatever. Okay not terrible, but I'm not the best either. Anyway, I'm going to move on.  ANNA LOVES AB-BOY!!  It is so damn obvious. I swear, they are so going to start dating senior year. She is so in love with him, or his abs as she says. I tease her. Just like I tease her about everything else in the world. I get my fairshare of it too. Yeah, thanks for the nickname guys. 'Gibbs'? Seriously. Call me Carebear. Or Ephie. Or something better than Gibbs. Please, people, we need new nickname skills. Let's get lives, all of us. Together. w00t.    For all of you reading this know that you are subjected to be vented upon. So here is a vent now. I'm sort of annoyed with Anna. She totally blocked me, and up, I dunno why. I'm wondering what I did wrong this time. I wonder if she has an idea. i think she might be telling me to go away. Wai.  A loss of a best friend. Nothing said from Anna, as of yet, along she is working on her homework, unlike procrastinating me. But that's okay, I'm allowed to. I mean, WAI! Why is Anna hating! Annoyance factor rising.  Tell me Anna!! C'mon! You're mah bestest friend, please?  Also, Coach Waters, which is mainly a daily vent. WHY DO YOU MAKE ME DO THIS INFERNAL WORK!! That's all I really have to say. It just annoying. I thought I was going to do a report on the Gods and Goddess of Greece, not the Persian Wars. The Persian Wars. Ah, let me give you a run down. 1. They happened somewhere between 492 B.C. and 479 B.C.  2. The people in it had odd names 3. There are multiple King Darius..eis... 4. The people have dumb names. 5. It wasn't important enough to be made into a movie, like The Trojan Wars. Which is also a condom brand.  6. If there was a movie, it wouldn't have Viggo, Orli, Brad Pitt, or anyone cool in it.  7. It's dumb! I mean, really! WHO CARES?! They don't even have a condom named after the wars. The Trojan War must have been a war of sex or something. Stupid Persian wars, no great sex.   Anyway, enough of that.  Daily Update!  [Music] - [Flavor of the Week]- American Hi-Fi [Mood]- [Decent] [Game]-  erm...None.    Gripe of the Day.  Papers Coach Waters gives.   Quote of the Day or week:  "I'm not Butter. Or Bitter." -Me.
Well, this is like my first post. I'm not too sure what all to say, but you know, Josh better hurry up with the layout. Because, I hate waiting for it. I also really need some sort of photoshop or adobe? Yes, please, thankies, It's needed badly. Enough about this crappy layout, here's the day. Period by period.  First Block: Honors L.A. - Mrs. Heffner. No Josh, and others, she isn't related to Hugh. Shove it. Well, we watched Lord of the Flies, the um, one from 1963, which totally kicked ass. It was riddled with comments from Anna, Nick, Duc, Tiffany, Courteny, David and myself. Yeah, although Duc fell alseep, along with Anna. I hit Anna a few times with my jacket until she stole it from with. Which left me freezing to death in my "I heart Nerds" shirt. Oh yeah, loads of fun. I think Duc likes Anna, just a thought. He's all tall and stuff. I'll get to that later. Anyway, the slackers, (which would be Anna and myself) were happily informed that our five paragraph essay wasn't due until thrusday. And that's why Mrs. Heffner rawks.   Second Block: Speech and Debate - Mr. Huff. For those of you that have heard me speak of Mr. Huff, let me infrom you that he rawks. He does scholars bowl, and he makes fun of us and them all the time. He had nicknames for everyone. You can't know mine, so don't bother asking, Bizznotch. S
