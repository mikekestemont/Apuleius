the next thing i chose was the motherboard. I ended up just finding an editors choice and going with the newer version of it. One of the biggest thing i wanted was something that was overclock friendly and the Aopen AX4 SPE MAX II was just the thing. It has 2 physical usb ports with the connections for 8 of of them. It also features 2 bios chips with one as a backup in case you burn out the other one. There are 5 PCI slots and one agp slot. It can take up to 4 gigs of memory. This thing is pretty damn cool. Its a standard ATX form factor.   up next is the processor...
Ok so this is about the case. I chose the case first because i wanted to know what things would look like. The case i chose is a thermaltake Damier V5000A. This thing is great. It supports ATX to extended ATX motherboards. Its a full tower with fve external 5.25" drive bays in the front alonmg with 2 4" bays. Its got 5 fans for super cool computing. This thing is loaded. It comes with a fan controller that can handle 4 fans at variable speeds, has a temperature sensor and alarm. Well you will just have to take a look at the case by going  urlLink here  or  urlLink here to thermaltake's website .
SO i am building a computer and this is going to outline how i did it. I am going to start off with all the parts and then go on to the assembly. The assembly posts will come as i am assembling it. I will post the problems and how to get around them as well. on to the case...

I really wanted to go see you today but i would rather plan it out seeing how we are going to risk being able to see each other in the future. I'm sorry you don't belive that i want to go see you. I really do darlin'. I'm not going to see you tomorrow or be able to talk to you much tomorrow so i really wanted to go see you. Its just that i would rather make sure we don't get screwed into not seeing each other by getting caught. I love you i really do and it hurts to hear you say  that you don't think that i love you. I do darlin'. I really do. I'm sorry that i don't show it as much as i should i guess. I try darlin' i do. I am still not used to showing the love i have for you. Anyway i love ou very very very much wheather you belive it or not and i will talk to you later.
i am glad to see that you have a blog up also. i'm sorry about not calling earlier but i thought it had said before 11. Anyway i hope that you are having a good time right now. I like the idea of this very much beause iam able to leave you messages and such on an ongoing bassis and i can also go back and fix you spelling mistakes. Anyway i love you very much and i will see you later today.
So this post is about my one and only. He is the sweetest guy I have ever known. I love him with all my heart, and I always will. We are going to move away in about a year, get married at some point, have kids, and get house so it can be OUR home. I'm so excited, I can't wait. I love you and he loves me. Well I guess thats enough for now. Just had to try this thing out. Later.
So darlin' i'm sorry but tomorrow i go fishing in the see. We are going up to plum island. We are leaving around ten in the morning and getting back not too late. the last time sucked because nobody caught any fish. I'm going to miss you very much darlin and will take your little bear with me to keep me company. I will try like hell to catch a fish for you even though you don't do seafood. I would like for you to come with me but i don't think you would like it very much seeing how we would be on a not so big boat in the ocean tryiong to catch things you don't like. Its cool when you actually catch something but not so cool when you spend hours sitting there and catch absolutely nothing. I love you darlin' an di wish i could be with you rather than spending the day on a fishing trip. I want to make you happy i really do. Anyway, darlin' i am going to end it here. So i love you oodles of oodles and i will tlak to you later.
So, today was boring. Except when MY sweety came and visited me at work. I was quite excited to see him. I hadn't seen him in a couple of days. He bought me a leomonade. :)  I love that boy. I got to spend my break with him. I was happy. I probably won't see him again until Friday when he will hopefully come see me at work again. He's such a sweety boy, so good to me! Anyways, thats it. I love you sweety! MUAH!!!
So i am going to the orhtodontist today for a 3:10 appointment. I get my braces off soon. My girlfriend realy likes my braces for some reason. I don't understand i
