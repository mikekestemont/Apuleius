Hey everyone! I'm gonna take this time to ask you guys for a favor! Okay I'm participating in a Relay for Life this summer. I need donations or whatever they're called. If you could donate any money at all please give them to me, Tricia, or there's jar in the office and whatnot. We could use LOTS of money! Thanks everyone! Okay back to business lol. I just found out I'm missing out little signing little pieces of paper thing for yearbooks. Only there aren't yearbooks yet! Oh well! I'd much rather go to a Twin's game by far! Um ya I'm way too excited to write, later everyone!--kiki
Tonight I have another softball game at seven o' clock have to be there an hour and fifteen minutes earlier though. Today at school not much happened. I found out that Ms. Thurnau will be going to the Twin's games in Kansas City, too. What a coinkydinky! Today on the way to study hall oh my gosh it was so funny I like stepped on Zanik's shoe lace and he tripped and fell! I felt bad but it was SO funny! I really wanna see the movie The Day After Tomorrow--it looks REALLY good! Oh gosh that test in English was kinda hard! I hope I did well on it! The last thing I need is to bomb a test at the end of the year. Well I think I'm gonna go play some bejeweled! WOHO~! love ya all!---Kiksta!
Hey everyone! My grandma and grandpa left today. I have nothing to do today because no more school-ball! Today there was a choir concert presentation for my school at the end of the day it was SO BORING. I fell asleep. No offense if you were in it, but that was SO boring. Except good job to all the solo people you did good I listened to you guys! We also went to the high school for a tour of the school even though I know it by heart almost. I have two tests to study for tonight and I have to watch the Twin's games! Geez! Well nothing else to say you guys. Love yas---kiks
Hello everyone! I'm in a pretty good mood considering my miserable day. This weekend my southern star team and I trecked to Blue Dirt-hehe and had a tournament w/ 5 games! Yesterday we won all three games and I had good games myself. Today though we lost our first game against Spencer, Iowa by like a lot. The problem though was that it was pouring rain. Not only was it raining but the fields were like swimming pools. I pitched one inning of the second game and struck out one girl which is awesome because the ball was constantly soaked and muddy. I didn't walk anyone either ;)! The second game was jipped though. We ended up getting 3rd place in the tournament which sucks! We played Fairmont last right? Well okay they batted and only scored one run right, okay no prob. HOWEVER! When we were up we had one out runners on 1st and 2nd and the umps called the game because it was raining so hard! So we lost and we didn't even get a chance to have a full at-bat! Not fair! Oh well, we got a medal...and we have a game tomorrow, we'll just have to win that! I'm so excited for school to end! I'm also sad though because it means hanging out with some people less than I would like to. My goal this summer though is and I quote "lose 20 pounds and get an AWESOME tan" that is my goal..you can quote me on it later too...we will see! I'm excited for this weekend. I don't really care that I'm missing the dance. They've been really gay this year. I don't know if it's because of the people at our school or the DJs or maybe they're just planned wrong somehow. The only downer is I can't dance w/ Zanik. For Valleyfair though I'll make it up to him and hang out w/ him there. So that way I don't have to wonder around by myself. I probably would've found someone else to hung out w/ though anyways. It's not that I don't have friends it's just I don't have a BEST friend. Ya know what I mean? A best friend to just hang out w/ and tell EVERYTHING to? Ya that would be cool but whatever I've survived so far without one and life is fun now anyways I'm not bugged. On Friday I realized that I had forgotten my knee brace in my gym locker and I needed it for my softball tournament. So my sis drove me over to the school and there was a janitor at the school (at like six o' clock at night...weird..) so I stood at the door and knocked til he finally came and let me in. I almost hugged him but then I'm like "Kirsten...no..." Well I guess I better be off my grandparents are here for a while so I better go talk w/ them so I don't seem like a snob or whatever! Much love----kiki
Tomorrow my sister's having a party because she graduated from college a while ago. Thankfully I have an excuse to avoid being around drunk-collegers! I have a southern star softball tournament in Blue Earth-five games total between Saturday and Sunday! JEEPERS! Then a little later I'm going to Tricia's to hang out w/ her and Beth L...maybe Melissa er..I don't know...cuz confirmation is FINALLY over! My lucky brother and two of his friends are going to the Twins game tonight, so not fair! I'm very jealous! I will just be stuck at home...watching them on TV...talking on the phone....tear...jk! I'll get over it, I'll be at their games next weekend anywho! Well gee I guess I don't have anything else to say! I'm outty! Love you all very very much! hehe----Kiki
Today was a good day for me. I finally got an apology out of someone w
