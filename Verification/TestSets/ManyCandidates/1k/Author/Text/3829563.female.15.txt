under water pressure, the colors flee escaping swirling together as one flooding the sink a flash of light and color and down the drain they swirl
Pretty Girl (The Way) was a song I discovered a year or two ago, its quite good, at least worth listening to.&nbsp; A nice love song, but little edgy. &nbsp; Yeah, well I was reminded of this when I heard their new song Memory on the launch cast radio. &nbsp; Memory bringing back memories. &nbsp; Sorry for posting allllll the songs I find that I like.&nbsp; But I think it is worth it, we can realize each others tastes and such.
MWAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA  sorry. random laughing. yes. hey hil what do u think abot playing broken? the tab looks like it would take some effort but it would be worth it. what do ya think?  &nbsp; and yes we should definetly murder jessica simpson. who sang the original angel? i dont like that woman. i dont see why nick lachey married her. honestly. okay im going to go read up on the apprentice. wahoo.
Almost over by Limp Bizkit, not my favorite band but the verses are cool. &nbsp; Blue eyes look you over, with a turquoise rim they stare, accusing, a darkness oozes out and over, surrounding you over your head the chill of the glare as icicles form in your mind you are lower than an ant and those never blinking eyes will never leave.  &nbsp;  Peacock Feathers
"Well somebody told me you had a boyfriend who looked like a girlfriend that I had in february of last year, its not confidential I've got potential.."  That's somebody told me by the Killers, pretty cool, well I really just like that line, what abbout that just doesn't make you happy?
I just got ahold of Dookie, which is an old school Green Day Albumn.  I say if we become anything, we shoudl do a cover albumn, and beat the shit out of Jessica Simpson for butchering Angel, which was a beautiful song, before she killed it trying to use her voice in a way she does not have enough power for.  Sorry you aren't Christina.   can you tell it bothers me?  "Save us from the wicked, shield our souls..."
Float on is some trippy shit, oh my spinning sheep.  No Sapphire lets not think about what they are doing to the sheep.  And in the silence of the night one might find peace and satisfaction where all other elements have gone to ground the intensity of the silence overpowers simple creatures, simple thoughts and simple dreams Particles of dark emerge, contrasting and confusing the senses, spice in the wind brought to the tiger
hey what do u think of 'Unwell' by Matchbox 20? i think its a great song. we should play it. does colleen know about this blog?
especially on bagels, it is a must.
yes it is me
and a clean sheet, beautiful
My genius plan:  1. Name change (It will still be the bleached chameleons but with a twist)   N(g).I(mrie).B(abbit). = NIB or it could be BIN or NIB or BNI (but who cares really.), but i intend to make it so it would be like Naughty Ignorant Bitches. or something. you get what i mean. I can't think of anything right now.   Nagbim (NG, IM and BA shuffled) or we could reshuffle it. anything as long as its readable. Hilary you could do the work here you english genius you. anyway.   So it would either be NIB, BIN, NIB, BNI or Nagbim or whatever and after that we'll put aka Le Blanchi Caméléons. (hey, shut up its cool.)   reason why we will use french: parce que, nous reuni dans Canada et apprenez Francais even though we don't really want to. (BEcause we met in canada and learn french even though we dont really want to) which doesnt make much sense really, but still, french is cool.    New name:  NIB aka Le Blanchi Caméléons   or we could just be known as L.B.C though it kind of sounds like a news channel but thats okay i guess. so yes, OPINIONS PLEASE!! i just think The Bleached Chameleons sounds a little bland.  note to self: le nom does not matter. (but i just wanted to speak my mind :()  2. 2004-2005 year plan    at least 5 self composed songs (with all parts written out of course)  hopefully all well rehearsed  5 cover songs well rehearsed (we will each pick one, and the other two will jointly agree on)   record a demo before the summer starts (5 cover songs, 5 original)  coffeehouse!! (its time for the school to suffer, no just joking)   and if possible maybe more original songs (dont worry, ill be doing most of the work for writing. colleen, youll have to write your own parts though, i dont know drums too well.)   note: may seem a little far fetched, but its possible as long as we practice hard and ya know, we should actually start doing something? it doesnt have to be fantastic but it will be intersting. we can sell each demo for like 10 bucks or something. or if we are really that bad, maybe 5. I have lots of ideas pour le album. he he he..   3. Long term plan  Lets just wait till we settle next year yea? hehe though it would be cool to like go platinum or something.   Sorry, I'm kind of dreaming here.   okay, COMMENTS PLEASE, PEOPLE!! (we shall have to add colleen to this soon)
Rocking to the sounds of The Killers.  I just want to blare it and jump up and down and scream the lyrics.  we could change the lyrics...  Well somebody told me that you had a girlfriend that looked like a boyfriend that I had in february of last year...  yeah, happy day.   -------------- Now to the Purpose of this Post ----------------  My H. (my Bass Teacher) has been teaching me how to make bass lines in a very strange way.  I still do not get how you figure out all the notes in certain chords, but I am guessing you c
