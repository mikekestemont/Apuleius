After the death of Ronald Reagan, and watching his funeral on television,  I’ve been thinking about that time in which he was President.  These years, I was a young man in high school, about to face the world.  Ronald Reagan was a very likeable man.  I think I might have enjoyed sitting down and having a drink with him, discussing our views.  I imagine him respecting me even when I disagreed with him, yet being very persuasive. The many stories I’ve heard confirm just that.  He was able to get people on his side on a bipartisan level never since equaled.  There's something to be said for a background in acting, and I hope I can possess even some of those qualities.    Still, there are many who cannot get over the fact that he completely overlooked the AIDS crisis for seven years, until 1987.  The general political response was that AIDS only affected homosexuals and IV drug users, so the general public need not worry.  The implication was that those people did not matter, but they did, and many are not here today.  But, you know what?  I can cut Ronald some slack by knowing he was a good man, but a man of his time.  The entire world was less tolerant twenty years ago, and times have changed.  Or have they?  Today, our President does seem to be aware of and concerned about the AIDS crisis around the world, and is doing something about it. This is definitely a good thing.  I mean, it is now common knowledge that this virus does not discriminate.    Unfortunately, people still do.  We still have overly harsh drug laws, and a congress that is considering amending the US Constitution to specifically define marriage in order to exclude same sex couples who wish to build a life together.  The current President backs such an amendment, while his challenger in the next election has a slightly better idea, but not by much.  So, I am led to believe that the sentiment is that these people still do not matter. Why is there such hatred for people who love in a different way?  And why are addicts treated like vile criminals who deserve what they get, instead of people with a problem that need help?   I mean, we have first time juvenile offenders doing hard time in adult prisons.  Who benefits from this?  Would Ronald Reagan support this today?  The man I have heard discussed recently would not.  He said that everyone mattered.
I just got out of rehearsal for Much Ado About Nothing.  I tell you, I love working on Shakespeare more than anything else.  With Shakespeare’s amazing words up on their feet, adding behavior and intention, there is nothing that makes me feel more alive.  Being that I am playing Don John, I went in trying to be cautious of not playing a stereotypical generic villain.  But with the strong direction of Lisa Jackson, who’s helped me to find a specific, strong point of view, and the skillful, giving talent of my scene partner, Brian Flegel- they are making my job so easy that it actually seems unfair.  Shakespeare was a master of words, and words are truly powerful things.  Elizabethan audiences reveled in the joy of sound the way we do visuals today.  They would go to “hear” a play… very much the way we would “see” a film today.  It was an “audio” society- hence the word “audience”.  But I do believe that words and language can be as powerful today as they were then.  For the Elizabethans, the art of debate was a primary component of their education.  They would have to effectively argue for both sides of an issue before they could pass.  I really believe that if more of us could do this today, we would all be closer to finding the truth about things.   For the truth is that there are two sides to every story, and that each side usually has at least some validity for most subjects.  I especially believe that our politicians, political commentators, and even our media would gain much by studying Shakespeare, who was the master of rhetoric and was incredibly insightful when it came to seeing both sides of any coin.
Yesterday, after getting out of rehearsal, a few of us went to see Fahrenheit 911. Michael Moore makes a very good case for his views, if you already agree. My complaint about this film is that he is mostly preaching to the choir, and does little to sway those with opposing views or those on the fence.  Still, I believe it is important for us to see many of the strong images in this film, even if I am not entirley ready to agree with every single thing he says.  The first thing that the film brought up was that in the 2000 election, when the Supreme Court decided to stop the recounts and declare Bush the winner, it would have taken only one senator to challenge that decision, and NOT ONE of them signed.  This includes Democratic senators that I voted for.  Now, I remember thinking then that if it had happened the other way – if Bush had gotten the popular vote and Gore the Electoral vote and thus the Presidency, I would have had nothing to say.  So I decided to accept the fact that I didn’t get what I wanted that time.  Still, many of my friends to this day complain that Bush stole the election.  But I am now also forced to wonder if it wasn’t given to him when it could have been so easily contested.  Also, I know someone who works within the Energy industry in Houston, Texas.  He is someone I think very highly of, and have known him to have spoken up against financial greed.  I would be hard pressed to believe that he would be part of any business that wasn’t doing something good.  Now, Moore only mentions a few specific corporations, but I can see how someone without the proper perspective might c
