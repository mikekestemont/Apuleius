Adventure camp    rocks   .    &nbsp;  The program wasn't very good, but, the people in the camp were very fun to be with. It's been so long since i enjoyed a camp.    &nbsp;  Night one, it was raining very heavily, with all the thunder and lightening and girls' screaming too. So one or two tents collapsed and the FA (faciliators) had to get all of us out. It was a funny sight, a big group of people wearing yellow raincoats running for shelter. Each time there was a lightening flash, people will squat down halfway running, and yeah...screams. So we all got soaked wet and&nbsp; cold.    &nbsp;  Day 2 at Ubin was kinda interesting. We had to use skills learn to find clues using a map and a compass. We were the second group to reach, even though we were stuck for very long on the 2nd clue. The mosquitoes at Ubin are    vicious   !! Thank goodness there was an insect repellent, or i might have had more bites. After we finish the trekking, we went to the mamam beach for lunch. We cooked ourselves and erm.. it was kinda disgusting.. haha. Apple was still the best!    &nbsp;  Night two, the best night ever. We stayed up for very very long to play games in the guys room. We played indian poker and a game called    ti tu tiu   . haha... it was damn fun. indian poker was a lot of sabo-ing, and loser had to drink bottles of water which accumulated every round. Ti&nbsp;tu tiu... haha.. what more can i say.&nbsp;It&nbsp;was&nbsp;   The Game    of the camp.&nbsp;Now we have a Ti Tu Tiu club, with a president and vice president.. haha..    &nbsp;  Day 3, we went to the ELF outdoor area. They have things like flying fox etc.. kind of fun. Alot of group work.. my group may not have won, but it was still very fun. After that we went to pack our tents and went for lunch. The best lunch of the camp - at SAA. Had things like curry puffs, spring rolls, fried rice, PROPERLY cooked bee hoon, chilli fishballs etc. The finale was of coz another few rounds of Ti Tu Tiu!     &nbsp;  Cant wait for tmr where there is going to be Memory Lane for the camp.    Cant wait to play Ti Tu Tiu again with those ppl!
I'm off to the adventure camp organised by the tp adventure club!     &nbsp;   Why am I going?    1. Cause I&nbsp;want to join a FUN camp, which is not so taxing.&nbsp;After my pri 5 camp, I&nbsp;dont think I have joined a camp which is fun, cause&nbsp;all the camps&nbsp;I went to were band camp, band camp and more band camp.&nbsp;    2. I   think   by joining, i can get&nbsp;some&nbsp;SEAL points... I   think  .. haha    3. Meet more people ^_______^     &nbsp;   Wish me luck that I'll have fun :)
Today was another boring day... 3 hours of BCS (some stupid  computing stuff), what more can I say! The whole class was so obviously bored, and practically no one was paying attention to the tutor.   Before BCS, at APEL, we had to do a personality survey test. We tabulated the results and plotted it against a graph to see which "fish" we belong too. Yes,   fish  . There are four fishes - Colourful Guppy, Peaceful Angelfish, Powerful Swordtail and Careful Goldfish. You can roughly guess which personality each type represent. So I did the test and guess what, I'm not under any category! The plotted point on the graph was in the middle of nowhere, at the cross section of all the four categories. It's is like saying: Sorry, but you have a personality disorder!    This is so similar to when in sec4, we had to take a career survey test to see what job fits us. And mine said something like "Sorry, there are   no   jobs suitable for you. But dont worry, there are other opportunities." while everyone else had jobs which suited them!  Damn, I'm always the   odd   one out.
Today was a  bad  day, or at least for me.  At 11, my group (boon, cpc, farissa, sijia, danni, crystal & i) went to do our field trip for FFB sci on supermarkets at TM NTUC today. After the trip, we were late for Intro to H&T lecture, so we ran for the stupid bus 23. While running, my sandals strap broke. So i was like running with a broken sandal on the wet floor, my jeans all soaked in gross water.  I have just finished viewing all 70 pics we took on grace chan's birthday last fri. It was   super   fun! Chan didnt know about the surprise birthday party we (charmaine, carene, cheryl, grace khoh, julianne, peini, zibin & i) were gonna have for her, so she was sulking the whole day (a few days actually) as her good friends "told" her that they could not celebrate it with her. On fri, grace khoh "lured" her back to her house and then we were with the bdae cake! We had a good time, especially with all those food - brownies, chickens, chocolate fondue, oh ya, and bao!  I really really  miss  my sec sch friends. We use to hang out so often, but now with our busy schedules, we have to  plan  to meet. So many wonderful memories...
Tears   music & lyrics:  Yoshiki   doko ni yukebaii anata to hanarete ima wa sugisatta toki ni toi kakete nagasugita yoru ni tobidachi wo yume mita ikoku no sora mitsumete kodoku wo dakishimete nagareru namida wo toki no kaze ni kasanete owaranai anata no toiki wo kanjite  * Dry your tears with love  Loneliness, your silent whisper fills a river of tears through the night Memory, you never let me cry and you, you never said good-bye Sometimes our tears blinded the love We lost our dreams along the way But I never thought you'd trade your soul to the fates, never thought you'd leave me alone  Time through the rain has set me free Sands of time will keep your memory Love everlasting fades away Alive w
