:D  yaay!  Yesterday was so fun!   I went to my friend Hannah's party/get-to-gether 30minutes early.  XD   So we talked a while, then we played dance reveloution.  :D  I am horrrible.  ^=^   And then people started coming, so I stopped and we watched one of the dummest yet funniest movies ever... Monte Python and the Holy Grail.   O_o;;  I am still seriously cunfuzzled about stuff, but oh well.  Then we played dance reveloution again, untill everyone was gone but me and Hannah!  : D  She was taking me home, so...  they invited me to sleep over, but I had to wake up early to go to Michegan Adventured with my other friend.  *yawns*  Tired-E-ness.    So we decided to go outside and wet our hair with the hose because we were so hot!  ** :: see postponed note :: **   And then we started fooling around with it, and by the time we went back inside an hour or so later, we were so soaking wet!  XD  Funness!  So we wrapped towles around ourselves, and played flash flash reveloution on the computer, and then we got bored so we decided to talk again, then Hannah's daddy came into the room and laid pictures infront of Hannah, saying:  "Here you go,"   If anyone watches Frasier, then know its over :( .   But Hannah's daddy is really good friends with the guy who trains the dog, and the pictures were 5 signed group pics of the cast, and then 5 signed doggy pictures!  : D  And see gave a set to me!  *huggles Hannah*   She be so nice!  Then I went home, and narrowly missed my parents.  I was supposed to be home 2 hours before that... O_O;   Now today, I am waiting for my friend to pic me up to go to Michegan Adventures, a theme/water park.  Yaay!  XD  *falls asleep*  *groans*  to.......... early........... *yawns*
: DDDD   I probably get to go to Michegan Adventures!  Yaay!  Only, I'll have to suck up alot because... *shivers/trembles*  rollercoasters.. O_O;;   Ever since I was little, I made the mistake of going on a HUGE rollercoaster for kids much older than I was *hight limits, HAH!  I'm taller than all of those!*  and it was sooooo scary!  And I also made the mistake of going down a waterslide called "the Cliff", which went straight down.. O_O;;  sooo freaky!  But I have to rescedual my drum lessons then... ;_;  So sad... I like Andrew.. he's so nice!  Oo;; *looks at writing*  AUGH!  NOT LIKE-LIKE, JUST AS A FRIEND!!  *chases around in circle*  ^^  But oh well, I'll practice extra tomorrow!  Oh, tomorrow!  I'm going to a paaaaaarty!  x3  I'm giving my friend Hannah a gift, because it was origionally gunna be her half-birthday party.  :D   But I don't have my hair low-lighted yet... my mom doesn't know how, so I'm gunna figure out a place to get it done at.   X3  I think I'll do Excel, because that place is just awesome!  :J  La laa... does anybody read this?  *looks at my corner marked 'America'* *looks at corner marked 'Canada'*  *Everbody's in the Canada corner*  DON'T LEAVE ME OUT!!  :D  I'LL GO TO THE BBQ!!  MY MIND WILL BE THERE, BUT MY BODY WON'T!  *shouts*  Well, I gotta go call my friend.  Ciao!
La la la... Philip is a JERK!  >   Now for the hair part... I'm buying the low-light stuff tomorrow... O_O;;  I've only ever done something this drastic... TRY to dye my hair light brown... it turned out dark brown and green-lookin'.  *sighs*  Well, I gotta go... bye!
O_o;;  Lack of idea for title gives you what you are eating right now.. o-O;;  Cookies and Creme Pudding sticks.  Oo;;  Hee hee hee?  My parents are gone on a one-day cruise with a Radio DJ and other winners.  This is the 2nd time my Daddy one something.  He won beachboy tickets, but we were gone when it was.  TT_TT  So sad.  =D  I'm making an ID Card for here, and I'll post it as soon as I'm done... if the oekaki stinks, I'll draw it out then scan it, which would probably be worse.  o_O;;  Oh well.  XD  Meh loves to draw.  La la la... when I go church camping, I get to bring a friend, yay!  Kayla gets to bring two because my mom said so, but I only wanted one.  =D  You'd think a tent that fits max of 3 would fit five girls?  We're getting a new tent!  Yaaay!  X3   When we go camping-camping, its gunna be storage, but for now Kayla gets the bigger one, because she has 2 friends coming.  Hannah and I are gunna have so much fun, because Kayla and I already have a big tent!  Lotsa room!   Kayla and I have been switching from new tent to new tent because well, we've grown a lot, and tents have broken.  o_O;;  Good news is:  I won't have my little friend this time for church camping!   I get to ride horses, shoot arrows, go river tubing... its so much fun!   Last time, it was SOOOO cold at night!  My sister and I woke up before five am because it was so cold, and we're able to work everything, but everything we needed for hot-chocolate was in the truck, which was locked.   X(  My parents had the key, and we couldn't wake them up.  So we went back into our tent, frozen stiff, and pushed our cots together, when in a sleeping bag, and cuddled up as close to the other as possible.  Both of us couldn't sleep, so we read and listened to our music.  It was fine during the day, but SO COLD!  O_O;; brrr... I hope its better this year.  Heey... *jumps to previous topic*  my id is turning out pretty good!  Yays!  Well, I'm gunna end this weird-o post.  o-O;;    Oh, and I'm still in the thinking stage about streaking my hair... O_O;;
