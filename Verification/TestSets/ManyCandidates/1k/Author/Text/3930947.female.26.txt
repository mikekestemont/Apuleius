&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here I am in the internet cafe checking on my emails and posting another blog. I'm running out of ideas as to what title I'll give this so please bear with me...My day at work was pretty productive. I was busy investigating the bug Mr. Yabe emailed this morning. I've already finished the modification so I'll help Armi tomorrow with the other 2 bugs. I'll be gone for about a week so all bugs must be fixed so as not to burden Armi. Later this p.m. Utik came to the office and brought some jewelries. As usual I was excited to look at them and luckily I found the bracelet that I like at first sight! It was expensive but it's a gift for myself. It's my first real italian-gold&nbsp;bracelet that I brought. =)     &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tomorrow is Friday!!! Plenty of things to do at the office. There's the Sportsfest meeting, bugs to fix, call Citibank to inquire about the cheque, go to Macro to buy diapers for grandma and our team meeting. Of course, there's the usual Friday Night Out with my girlfriends but we are planning on eating at Shakeys' and later on go to Maricris' hotel room to watch DVD. Then off to the bus terminal at 2a.m. But before that, I have to pack my bag tonight and do some last minute preparations. Well that's all for now. I have to go home now and talk to my sister. Goodnight, my dear blog!!! ;p
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to the pitter, patter of the rain outside, I long to go out and feel the rain on my skin. As I read Claire's blog, I do agree with her that life as a child is much more simpler compared to that of an adult.&nbsp; You don't have to worry about money, lovelife and life, the only thing you have to worry about is when you'll be able to have fun again. But looking back, I did enjoy my childhood. I played with my sister, cousins and "hacienda's" children. Television was not much of a factor back then, we interact more with each other. We played "taxi!", jackstones, "tumba-preso", hide-and-seek and all sorts of games that we could think of. Injuries abound me especially since I like to play boy's games like somersaults(which resulted to a broken ankle ;p). I had lots&nbsp;of childhood friends up until now eventhough most of them are married and have children of their own. I do wish that my children, i.e. if God permits =), would have the same opportunity to experience those things.     &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I always have mixed feelings when it rains. It makes me happy when it's weekend and I can sleep all day long. :p It makes me sad when I'm depressed and i feel so alone. But i'm only human so i'm entitled to being moody once in while. Right now, as I'm writing this blog, I'm a little bit worried that if this rain keeps up it would be a bit dangerous going home to Bacolod. The roads are slippery and I have to pass thru steep mountains and slippery roads before I can arrive to my destination. Rain or shine, I want to go home. I miss my parents. It's been months since we last saw each other. I'm so excited, one day more to go and i'm going home!!! I don't have that much activities to do there except visiting my family, Pio's family and of course, Pio...two months more to go before his 2nd death annivesary and I miss him still. Maybe I'll always miss him. I wish.....But enough of my gloomy thoughts! I'm glad to know him and knowing that he's happy wherever he is. He's my angel... =)     &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a happier note, I'm busy at work meaning Armi and I have something to do. hehehe...I'm also excited to see what Utik is bringing this afternoon. Hopefully she'll bring jewelries that I'll like. Andy emailed me early this morning. It was good to hear from him especially after clearing up some issues. I'm sweet, eh? lol...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Life is full of surprises! Sometimes you're up, sometimes you're down. It's like a big game being played out and I'm one of its players. Yesterday was pretty emotional time for me especially finding out that my brother failed in 2 of his subjects. It feels like I failed too as a sister since I didn't know why this happened. But things have a way of working out. On a positive side, I'm glad it happened and made my brother realized his mistakes. Last night, I've seen how sorry he was and wished that it never happened. It was heartrending to see someone you love cry but in the end it matters that he knew and learned from his negligence.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Family and friends are real treasures in life. Thanks Papa for the words of wisdom. Thanks Ri for listening to my ranting. Thanks to all you guys for the jokes that enables me to forget my problems. Thank you God... I feel so blessed today. It rained but the sun shines after it. I got in from work by 8:01a.m. but the guard consented to my filing of failure to swipe in at 8:00a.m. The canteen has the Thirsty stand built. My Japanese client gave his permission to my leave of absence next week. We will go to Slimmers later on to have a workout. I'll be able to watch the Amazing Race by 8p.m....So many things to be thankful about. Hopefully, you'll have a good day like mine!!! =)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hello again my dear blog. i am bothered. my sister told me this morning that one or 2 of my brothers' grades were either NC or 5.0. i am afraid that he'll lose his scholarship because of his negligence.&nbsp;i sure hope not. i wish to almighty God that it's not true. please please don't let it be true. if it's true, i hope that he'll be given another chance to do better...    afterthought : ************* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4:52p.m. &
