For those of you that don't know, there are many many other operating systems than Windows. There are of course Apple's Macs, but there is a whole nother world out there such as Unix,  urlLink Linux , FreeBSD and others. I'm getting into  urlLink Linux , because unlike Windows and Macs,  urlLink Linux  is completely free. In fact, I'm going to go buy a new computer on Saturday and I am going to make it a dual boot between Windows XP and  urlLink Suse Linux . If I get to know Linux I'm going to make it my permanent operating system. What turned me onto Linux was a version called  urlLink Knoppix .  urlLink Knoppix  is a version that you download, burn and restart your computer.  urlLink Knoppix  runs right off of the cd and dosen't install anything to your computer. It comes jam packed with tons of software. Linux is also more secure than Windows too, isn't that pretty sad? That a completely free operating system is more secure than a operating system that you pay $200 for! The only drawback to Linux is that a lot of popular software such as Microsoft Office dosen't run in Linux. But I have noticed that since the big security hole (Windows XP) came out, more and more software is being developed for Linux such as Unreal Tournament 2004.
Do you always need to be on your computer even while you are at work, school, anywhere but home? You have probably seen advertisements for GoToMyPc and such programs well  urlLink RemotelyAnywhere  is my favorite program for remote access.  urlLink RemotelyAnywhere  works right over your internet browser. It is also much more than a remote control program. You can see what processes are running and stop and end them. If your computer locks up you can reboot it no matter how busy it is. It has a built in telnet server and also an interactive command prompt without being in Windows, has a file transfer utility to give and receive files. You don't even have to remember another password because it uses your Windows user name and password. There are far too many features to talk about. I like that program for the internet but inside a network I like to use Remote Desktop Connection built into Windows XP Pro. To enable it go to control panel, system, remote and check the box that says Allow users to connect remotely to this computer. From there, to connect to it go to Start, All Programs, Accessories, Communication and Remote Desktop Connection and just type in the computer name and hit connect.
Almost every client I have had has asked, is AVG better than Norton? I used to say that just get completely rid of Norton and install AVG. For you people that don't know, AVG is a free Anti-Virus system. I use it for both my personal use and we use it up at school. Up until recently I got rid of Norton on computers I fix and put AVG on but I was wrong. Factory professionals decide to put Norton on new systems and I think that these professionals know quite a bit more than a 16 year old (me). The reason that I dislike Norton is because when I had a p3 (733mhz) and I ut Norton on there and it slowed it down miserably. Now I see a slight decrease in speed but not that much. I say if you already have Norton, keep it, if you don't get AVG.
Are you tired of forgetting your passwords? I mean you have a password for everything, your bank login, Windows, Linux, Mac, email and if you are a network admin there are tons of passwords that you have to remember, different servers, different accounts on workstations, security programs, it's just overwhelming. Introducing  urlLink KeePass .  urlLink KeePass  is basically a password safe where you store all of your passwords to everything. It put's them into a single file which that is either protected by a master password or a thing called a key-disk. A key-disk is either a floppy, cd or thumb drive containing a encrypted file that can unlock the database. I don't like the key-disk way because I have all my school network and client passwords in KeePass and if another student had gotten a hold of the database and the key a lot of people including myself would be screwed. Instead I put the whole program on my thumb drive and whenever I need a password I can plug it in wherever I'm at and have access to all of my passwords. I have a good master password for my database. Remember, all good passwords are made up of both lowercase and upercase letters and letters and symbols. Oh yeah, I forgot the best part, KeePass is completely free!
One of my favorite things to do on computers is cracking my family and friends Windows passwords. Most of the time I just do it to show off but there is times that the skill comes in handy. I have to admit, I didn't learn how to do this by myself, I watched episode 3 of  urlLink The Broken . There are multiple ways to do this, you can either replace the current users password using a program called  urlLink NT Password  or you can boot up the computer using a copy of  urlLink Knoppix , copy the computers SAM and System files to a usb thumb drive, take the files to another computer running Windows, downloading a copy of  urlLink Sam Inside  importing the SAM and System files into  urlLink Sam Inside  and then exporting it into a PWDump file. From there you get your hands on a copy of  urlLink LC5  and importing that PWDump file into it and perform either a dictionary attack, hybrid attack or a brute force attack against the file. The  urlLink NT Password  way is obviously easier, all you do is download  urlLink NT Password , burn it to a cd, boot from the cd on the t
