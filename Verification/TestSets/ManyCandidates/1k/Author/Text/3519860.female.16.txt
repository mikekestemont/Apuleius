Your eyes which first held me captivated where I stood.  Your smile to dazzle the sun and warm every corner of my soul.  Your voice like a sparkling mountain stream which flows into my heart.  Your walk and the way your gracefulness takes my breath away.  Your hair about which I dreamed cascading into my face as you leaned over me.  Your hands whose caress I crave to hold my face in their tenderness.  Your arms I long to have around my neck as you pull me close to your warmth.  Most of all everything you are changed the way I feel about my life.  I love you.
at night I dream of you, Coming to be by my side. I see your silhouette at first; I watch your calm, quick glide.  Vivid images; Pictures in my mind. My night's love, my passion; All in you I shall find.  Once again, you'll whisper to me, "Hello, my dear. " Your touch eases me, Removing any fear.  Your gaze meets mine; The warm look in your eyes, It melts my heart. From now on Nothing but blue skies!  Tonight you romance me; Our bodies entwine. You enter; I gasp! Our souls combine.  A touch here, a tickle there, It enthralls me; I am captivated. Our bodies move, the motion constant; My body's completely activated.  Throughout the night Our passion flows, Coming together, My emotion grows.  For you, in dreams, Oh, how I care. But when morning comes, I am left in despair.  Anther night gone and passed. I awake in ecstasy all alone. For you visit at night; In dreams you come. And I dread the coming of a new dawn.
The first time I saw you, I knew you were the one. There was no question in my mind, after having that much fun.  There's just something about you, that I've never found before. And now that we're good friends, I find myself wanting more.  I never thought it possible, to care for one so much. But everyday that passes, I long to feel your touch.  To look into your eyes, would make my day complete, cause every time you look at me, my heart just skips a beat.  Everything I'd wished for, every dream I'd hope come true, I never thought would happen, until the day that I met you.  I know that youâ€™re not ready, for the kind of commitment that I am, but for you I'd wait forever, there's nothing I can't stand.  Although it hurts to know, that you don't feel the same as me, hopefully one day you'll realize, one day you'll wake up and see.
