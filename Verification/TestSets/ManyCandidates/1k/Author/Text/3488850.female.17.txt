Not a while ago, I just chatted with a Secondary School Classmate. He is Kai.  We started off by asking how each other is doing. And, WOW, he is working with Matthew. Two good friends together. I often see matthew either going to work, or going home from work. Got once, how sweet he was, he helped to carry my guitar until we reached his block and we had to part our own ways. That time, I was truly tired, luckily with his help, it helps to complete half of my journey home.   OK, continue with my chat with Kai.  Nice to hear that his 'gang' of people are still together.  BUt that does not include SH JF & JY. These 3 girls, back in secondary school days, you cant separate them, lolz. They are nice girls... very sweet n hardworking, miss them so much. Due to something, we kind of got separated, and we were like never before. But i still miss them. They are friends worth making. I truly wish them all the best to their future. Smile~  Talking about friends...  I'm rather lonely...  I do not have a group of friends which i can go out together.  I have friends everywhere, but just friends that just say, HI then bye.  I spend my weekend in church to do service to God. I have more old people as my friends than the youths.  Weekdays, i slag at home, a home girl. ( during holidays ) Spend time with God, learning to sing songs from church, and MSN!! chatting.   Hmm, haven touch my guitar for a long time.     Friends must be always in your life. For they are your support,your eyes, your ears, your mouth and your shoulder.
Yesterday, I went back to my old school for Girl Guides activities. Wao... Havent go back for a long time, and yes, I missed my fellow guides very much. I felt so warm with them... the 12 of them who turned up.   We did knots and lashes. And 3 of us seniors tested them. It all went smoothly, well, mostly, it's because it was a small group. They learnt fast and willingly. Glad to see their kind of good attitude. Suddenly felt like throwing away all my responsibilities in my poly, and come back to help my guides, but things are not under my control.   BAck in poly, i join a CCA related to music. I do not feel the warmth there. There is no unity in some ways. Though i must agree, people are friendly at first.   Talk about my poly life some other time.   I just feel so happy to be with the guides. Maybe because i feel 'accepted' there, and also the warmth and belonging.   Peace I received, Peace I given.
This is my first post, yeah? A little introduction of my little self.  Hehez. I am going to turn 18 yrs old this year.  But no matter how old I am, I am still Dad and Mum's little child. Hmm, always little... Lolz.  I am a tetiary student now studying for a Diploma.  I am a small (little) sized girl who stands only about 156cm tall. I am very particular about my weight though. I must maintain weight below 47kg or 48kg at least. I am a little girl, who often smiles, not that I am crazy. I believe that smile makes it all. Highly Contagious. I did not realise about this until my friend told me that she often see me smiles, and she felt comfortable.  Well, I have my fierce moments also. Hahaz, ask my sisters!! I am also a girl who may get worry very often, but thanks to friends around with advises and calm.   And my religion. I am a little follower of Jesus Christ, still learning to follow his ways, and spread the Good News.  Though sometimes temptations led me away from God.   I am a girl learning to be independent, strong and brave.
Well, I'm totally drained from this attachment.  During this, I've got fever, sore throat and flu. Till now, i still have flu, it doesnt seem to get away. hai ahi....  me n him... i dont know....   new one is coming...

Today is Holy Trinity Sunday. Ermz... ***  Today was not that tiring after all.  As usual, I attended Mass.  I went to another church for some practise. It was nice...    I missed him.  Tomorrow is my first day of Vocational training program. I am not really looking forward for it. I dont know about tomorrow. Feeling abit scare... Attachment in a new enviroment and alone.  It's a catholic hospital i know. I know i'm not alone, as God is always with me. But no... Hope I can start this whole attachment good, though alone...   He, he... can he please give me comfort... I guess he doesnt know how i am feeling now... He must have too much to care, then to care for me... and also... even if i tell him my feelings, will he care much....  Seems like there are more others who give more concern than he gives...  But what i said the previous line, is it fair to him... haiz...
Today, didnt wana go anywhere, not even my guides or my poly CCA.  I went to Bugis with my mum and 2 sisters. We did some shopping. Bought mum a watch and i bought a bag.   Heh, he called me at 11pm. I was so shocked. I was so happy that he called. I missed him, though we just went out yesterday. HE just called to ask whether there's any news about some Mrt Line. The line that is going to his home was blocked, so he had to take another line. Well, the call ended fast.   My Wish: How i hope everyday, I will at least receive a message from him. A good day message, or Goodnight message. haiz... this situation still dont change...   Temptation in church...
Ahh... Today i had headache and stomach cramps. ***  Today, I took a bus that will pass b
