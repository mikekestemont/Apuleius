well, its almost the end of day 2 of my blog :) ther's a lotta text for 2 days, but ya know how it is, when I get a new toy I wanna play with it :)  My hay fever has been bugging me all day long... and I just found out that danique also has it... today was a really weird day... normally I'm cheering when I got a free day, I'll go do stuff I like all day long... but today I didnt really feel like doing anything... I felt really weird. Tomorrow is probabley the same deal, and I can sorta guess what's causing it too... It feels like butterflies in my stomach, only its not the same...  Today turned out to be a little fun anyway... I chatted for a while with Danique, but I could sense she was somewhere else with her thought... with vince, maybe? just before she went offline, vince came offline, and he was all lame and stuff... luckely those 2 dont got eachother's emailadresses... vince doesnt understand the word subtile though... when I told him I was chatting with Danique he was all like: "Dude, I'm not going to do anything with it, and this is just a normal thing, can ya please gimme danique's email adress??" wich offcourse, I didnt.. If he wants her email adress, then he should goto her and ask... Like I did(n't).  Tomorrow will definitley suck.. the entire day noone was online, except danique for 30 minutes, and vince for 15 mins... and I spent the afternoon at vince's house, playing James Bond ;) so probabley sunday will suck as bad too.. luckely there is fathers day, so we also must goto my grandpa (like in, my dads father ;)) so I would be gone pretty much all day... keeps my mind of stuff... wich is good, cause I keep on daydreaming about everything thats happened the last 2 days... and ofcourse about danique (and it pretty much keeps me awake too, so it may seem very nice and all, but at times it aint so nice...)  And after 2morrow, there will be.... monday... yesterday I looked up to it, but now I kinda feel like I wanna goto school again... wich is weird, at least for me it is ;)  well, I would love to make this post longer and longer, but I need my sleep (yesterday I almost didnt sleep, for no apperant reason...) well, bye :)
I just confronted him with the truth, and highly ashamed, and reallly really lame, he admitted he sended a mail... but he thought she would never see it anyway, cus its on her old email adress... Now, I actually dont want to, but still, I feel sorry for the guy... After all, being in love with someone is the nicest compliment ya can give that person... or so I think ;) OMG, the guy was actually mad I knew about the email, but I haven't reavealed anything. Luckely I changed my msn name, just before he could see it, so he didnt read this page yet... about reading this page.. OMG, the first few comments on my sick sick posts are there... thats like..... really weird :) but its still nice anyway (in case ya didnt know... I do have a nice side ya know... its just so hard to regonise it under the layers of pain and misserey, and self pity and such)  I find it strange that Danique hasnt replied to vince's email just yet, or maybe vince doesnt want to say sumting about that too... Danique didnt revealed anything either when I was chatting with her 10 minutes ago. I dunno, maybe she just doesnt want to hurt vince? or maybe she really likes him =| OMG, if so be the case, please shoot me...  ... what? why I havent exactley declared her my love and such? well, I'm too much of a shyguy for that, plus I have to draw a number for that... there's a long waiting list... her list of boys who like her is bigger then the list of people who need organ transplants... also, I can allready predict the answer with my magical 8th sense (XP) ... "NO! NO WAY! GET AWAY FROM ME, YA PERV! ARGH! How disgusting!" yeah, well, I'm getting weird and emotional again, so I better leave, maybe I'll post something again 2night ;)
whoops, I forgot one little thing... vince isn't supposed to sse the text from 2/3/4 blogs back... =| I'm in deep shit... but at the other hand, like I care, Danique just should've told him sooner, I'm not responsible for that shit...
Vince, I gotta ask ya this: WHY ARE YA FUCKING LYING TO ME, GODDAMNIT? I fucking know what ya sended to Danique in a email... about that u liked her and ya where to shy to tell her face to face... so what? what do ya think I will do to ya? kill you? goddamnit, I really can't trust ya, can I?  for the people who cant follow the series of events:  well, I just came home from being at vince's house... I could resist screaming and shouting to him, but I just couldnt resist asking what he sended in the email to Danique... damn, how can he say that he doesnt remember it... does he actually think I belive that? dream on... I feel pretty damaged... and pathetic too, the only persons I can trust and talk to, are inside my computer! (well, not exactley, but ya get my point) well, vince can come online any minute now, so then he will see the adress to this blog... so vince, this is to you: STOP LYING OR GET THE FUCK OUTTA MY SIGHT! DAMNIT... if I could do my life over again, I would do it in a heartbeat... ow well, cant do that so I'm screwed with this fucking life... gotta eat now, I'll be back
lol, yeah, in an hour I'm going to vince.. He doesnt know Danique doesnt like h
