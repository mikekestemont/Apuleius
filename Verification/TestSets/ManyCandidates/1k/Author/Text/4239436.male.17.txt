The Windows platform started a while ago, but by far, has made so much progress and improvements since the good 'ol Windows 3.1, not to mention DOS.    So, I have dedicated this blog as appreciation and informational to the people that use Windows. Yes, I know, there's always Linux, and may I add...there will be a Linux blog soon...but for now, let's stay with the majority...  urlLink continued story...
CSS has really changed web styles. It not only saves time, but you can customize your webpage color schemes to a higher extent. You can also create more professional looking websites just by adding styles to your documents. Today, I will show you a webmaster trick that uses CSS by applying mouseover styles that change as the mouse "rolls" over a table's background.     Explanation #1:  Alot of newbies don't know how to do this and so many people have asked me how to do this too, so I've decided to make a tutorial on it. What is suppose to happen is, when you place your mouse over a table row, the style should change to another style you have defined in what we will call " styles.css " (external stylesheet).   Create a new file in Notepad and save it as "styles.css":       td.On { background: #FF8A00; FONT-FAMILY: verdana; COLOR: #FFFFFF; FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 10px; } td.Off { background: #0056a2; FONT-FAMILY: verdana; COLOR: #FFFFFF; FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 10px; }       Explanation #2:  									 Now that you have your stylesheet you may link it to your html document like so:     &lt;html&gt;    &lt;head&gt;   &lt;link href="styles.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;   &lt;/head&gt;    &lt;body&gt;   &lt;table border="1" width="100%" bordercolor="#1C464F"&gt;   &lt;tr&gt;   &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;   &lt;/tr&gt;   &lt;tr&gt;   &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;   &lt;/tr&gt;   &lt;/table&gt;         Explanation #3:  Okay, go get some coffee or something worth while to drink, then come back...WELCOME BACK! Now back to work, the next thing we must do now is create the table like so (without the styles implemented):      &lt;table border="1" width="100%" bordercolor="#1C464F"&gt; &lt;tr> &lt;td>The dog ran the race.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;But the cat won.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt;       Explanation #4:  Now you may implement the styles. Note that becasue you attached the stylesheet as and external stylesheet, you can just add the 'class' attribute to your HTML tags and your styles will show up. THIS IS WHERE THE MAGIC IS! What you do is you add the code  onmouseover="this.className='on'"  and  onmouseout="this.className='off'"  to make the tables change as the mouse rolls over each row:     &lt;table border="1" width="100%" bordercolor="#1C464F"&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td class="off" onmouseover="this.className='on'" onmouseout="this.className='off'"&gt; The dog ran the race.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td class="off" onmouseover="this.className='on'" onmouseout="this.className='off'"&gt; But the cat won.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt;      Putting It Together:  Now as it is pieced together your HTML document should look something like this:     &lt;html&gt;  &lt;head&gt;    &lt;link href="styles.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"&gt; &lt;/head&gt;  &lt;body&gt;   &lt;table border="1" width="100%" bordercolor="#1C464F"&gt;     &lt;tr&gt;        &lt;td class="Off" onmouseover="this.className='On'" onmouseout="this.className='Off'"&gt; The dog ran the race.        &lt;/td&gt;     &lt;/tr&gt;     &lt;tr&gt;        &lt;td class="Off" onmouseover="this.className='On'" onmouseout="this.className='Off'"&gt; But the cat won.     &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt;  &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;      urlLink continued story...
PHP auto-redirection is an overlooked concept that many people fear. You should fear nothing because with a single line of code I can show you how to redirect your page to another! It's as simple as  1 - 2 - 3 .     Note:  										 The only precaution to be aware of is the code syntax. The syntax of this small, yet powerful script is very, very code sensitive. There are many single quotes and commas in this script and if you make one typing mistake, then your script will generate errors and you will end up with very unhappy visitors.   Insert the following code into your .PHP  										document you would like the redirection  										to take place:      &lt;?php    // Echos the page that you want to redirect to thus refreshing // The page to the pages specified after the code 'URL='    echo    &quot;&lt;meta equiv=&quot;refresh&quot; content=&quot;2;URL=&quot;&gt;&quot;  ;       ?&gt;     Conclusion  The small script may help out in many cases such as after a form has been submitted or a search has been made. This is something a web developer uses on a daily bases. I really hope this tutorial was helpful and may all your scripting be merry!  urlLink continued story...
PHP incorporates powerful and fast date and time functionality. In this article Ryan gives us the low down on PHP's various functions to manipulate the time and date with ease. Today's web sites try to offer a wide variety of useful data and information to the viewer. This is often what makes a web site more appealing than flashy graphics and cheesy animations. In fact, sometimes it is the attention to subtle detail that helps the web developer take that extra step into making a site appear more professional.    One simple way to add a professional detail to your web site is to post the current date and time within your web page. As insignificant as this might sound, it is a very commonly used way to show visitors that your site is slightly ahead of the curve. 										 The following basic PHP tutorial will show you how to use a few PHP functions to retrieve date and time information from your web server and display them neatly on your web site.   We Have A  										Problem:  No matter which operating system you are running your web server and PHP on, the procedure for gathering the current date and time is the same. The first problem is that the returned value is fairly cryptic.  									For example, the following PHP code:      &lt;?php    echo   time  ();   ?&gt;     Will quickly  										translate into:       Also Note: 	 Though this may not be very user friendly, it is an accurate measure of the date and time. This numeric date and time format originates from the fact that all Unix servers tell time by counting the number of seconds that have passed since 12:00 a.m. on January 1, 1970. All we need to do is learn how to display the above information in a way that makes sense to our site visitors.   Fixing The Problem:  Using PHP to convert the Unix timestamp into something more understandable is just a matter of employing the proper function. This tutorial will cover the use of a v
