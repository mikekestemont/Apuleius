I do need to pull out the Nordic trak and start exercising to speed things up. I would also not be surprised to find out it makes me feel better.

Fine she wants to take my happiness and kill it? Fine! Have at it it's what she does best! So what's a wife for anyway if not to ensure your misery and murder your hope.  Hell I'm not even allowed the luxury of bitterness.
