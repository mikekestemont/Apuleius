In the corporate world many people find themselves in a situation that requires them to share Workstations with other people. While this is easily done with windows XP, you have to be careful using the My File and My Documents folders.         &nbsp;        Unlike Linux, Windows was originally designed as a single user system and keeping your personal files personal takes a little extra thought. In Linux, your My Files or Home folder is inaccessible by anyone but the owner and the computer administrator. In Windows, you must save your sensitive documents under your profile (  usually c:/Documents and Settings/"your login here"  ), in order to be safe from prying eyes. Trying to store files anywhere else on the hard drive will leave them open to anyone who logs onto the computer.
In a recent Cnet report. Cnet reported that Google may be coming out with a desktop search program and touched on how Google, an ad based company might do matching ads to the files on your computer.  While I will at some point have two cents to put in about the ads on my computer, right now I want to talk about Google as a company, a forecast if you will.  Several years ago, many people might remember, Netscape was quite the up and coming internet company. Netscape had the Internet Browser market cornered and was making a very big impression on the market. Netscape could have been the next big thing in computers and taken the market by 1997, if but for one thing.  In 1995 or so Netscape announced that it was going to enter the Operating system market. Stating that within the next couple of years it would have a working Operating System for x86 (IBM compatible) computers. (for those that don't know, MS Windows is an x86 based operating system)  Microsoft killed Netscape as competition through illegal market power and is still feeling the Justice Department squeeze since it lost that anti-trust case.  How does this fit in with Google? Easy.  In the near future, I don't think it will take more that a year after Google begins exchange stock in the public market, I see Google bringing even more software to the internet consumer. I see a Google Linux of sorts hitting the market.  I also see Microsoft falling.  Google, if it so choosed, could easily take the desktop OS market with a custom version of Linux. People love Google. People love Google so much that they even tolerate ads specifically targeted at their searches. NOW THAT'S LOVE!  With this love of Google in the Internet Market, Google could easily come out with its own version of Linux and put it on the market. Since it would be from Google, people would look past the unfamiliar Linux Operating System, and Install it over Windows faster the Microsoft can say "speed racer".  Other companies see the consumers love of Google, and would quickly begin making software and games for the Google OS. I even see Microsoft, giving in and making programs for it.   I see all this happening within the next 12 months or so.   While not official, I hear by pronounce; "Google Linux" this years Operating System of the Year.  Think about it,  It could come true before you realize it.  G. Romero (editor)
Can anyone tell me why I even buy an anti-virus program?        &nbsp;        What do they do? Let's break it down.        &nbsp;        An antivirus program, such as Norton or McAffee, searches a users computer for things such as viruses, trojans, and worms. Every couple of hours it checks the Internet to see if there are any updates available. If there are, it downloads them and rescans the computer.        &nbsp;        While this makes since to most people, I truly don't understand. Is it not the Operating system writer that leaves the hole for a virus to come through? Why do we continue to see products like Mac OSX, Linux kernel 2.XX.X, Windows XP or Longhorn? Shouldn't we finish a product before we move on to the next level. Shouldn't an Operating System by "hacker proof" or "complete" before they move on to the next OS.        &nbsp;        Windows 98.        &nbsp;        Yes, the old faithful, Windows 98. While it had its share of problems and quirks, it was a leap ahead of ME, 2000, and XP in regards to security. Maleware writers had a much harder time writing viruses with this OS.         &nbsp;        The Big Question is; why did Microsoft even move beyond this OS when even it, while in our eyes is perfect, still held many errors and holes. Didn't Microsoft think to figure out how to fix these holes and making it more "hacker proof" before bringing out completely new code in a new OS..         &nbsp;        Hmm, I think I see something        &nbsp;        Mac OS9 - OSX        &nbsp;        While Mac OS 9 and OS X may not be the main stream OS, it certainly is a popular one with the graphics and medical professions. This Operating System almost seems completely out of reach of Maleware writers, I believe it doesn't get attacked like windows only because of a lack of interest in the OS as a whole and therefore not complete as a "hacker proof" OS.        &nbsp;        The Big Question is; I have a really hard time saying anything bad about Mac's OS's but with the recent release of security bugs found in OS X and up, one has to wonder whether Apple has their stuff together every time they upgrade their OS or if its just low usage of the OS that keeps it safe from attack.        &nbsp;        Linux/Unix        &nbsp;        While Unix is used in so many different industries, it tends to only be subject to direct attacks against certain companies. Why? We're not sure. Could be because if a person who knows Unix well enough to write a virus for it, usually is getting paid to maintain it.        &nbsp;        Now on the other hand is Linux. Linux is riddled with security holes.         &nbsp;        So what makes it different? Open Source does.        &nbsp;        W
