Last night all the ladies of lovely linda street gathered for a dinner that included veggie soup, pita pizza, (free) bread and roasted garlic, and yummy vegan molasses-ginger cookies for dessert (and several bottles of wine). We all toasted to the final months of our household, brainstormed costume-concepts for the final linda st. fiesta, and hashed out some of our domestic issues. I think it ended with everyone feeling okay about our final months together, and the idea that we'd try to enjoy them instead of squabbling about dishes and toilet paper. Not to say that this living situation has been difficult, but we all have our moments, especially in a house of 5 women. Overall it has been an amazing experience for me, and every one of my roommates has taught me something. As much as I can't wait to live with Jeff, I am going to miss having such a powerful female environment around me (that's the new age Amber talking).
Tuesdays are better than Mondays, but only slightly. I still feel like the weekend is far away, but at least I've taken the first step towards it in getting through yesterday. My Monday turned out being better than your average Monday. Despite feeling spent from my busy weekend, I managed to be a productive worker bee yesterday and get a lot done. I also did a pilates class at lunch and my sore abs are feeling its effects/benefits today. Last night I met my roommie for dinner at ChaChaCha, a place we tend to frequent quite often, and we ate our favorite platanos maduros and chicken quesadilla, washed down with a few pitchers of sangria (they were little pitchers, I swear), and had a long talk. We came to the realization that the platanos are almost better with whipped cream (thanks to the bartender's advice) than they are with black beans. Oh, and we also concluded that our issues are resolved and we're buddies again. Then we went home and did interpretive dance to Tori Amos music with our other roommates. Good times!   In running news, I have none to report, because I suck. I hope you all won't hate me when I totally flake on my commitment to run that half-marathon in August. I just don't see that happening.   Tonight.... Lovely Linda St. Roommate Dinner and maybe a movie. And Jeff leaves for Texas tomorrow :-(
I'm at a loss for an inspired title right now as it is Monday again, and my weekend has steamrolled over me and left me exhausted, broke, and unprepared for another full week. Not one, not two, but three friends from out of town were visiting this weekend, Fahrenheit 911 opened and I schlepped all the way to Daly City to see it, pride revilers and their festivities took over the city and (at times) my neighborhood - birthdays were celebrated, much food and alcohol was consumed, and mostly fun was had (I say mostly b/c I did have some drama with a friend :-(). Now I am back at work, dealing with Monday's abrupt return to reality. Not that this week is totally without hope - there is a three day weekend to look forward to (will anyone else be around?) and I get to spend it with two of my favorite people - the chico and his dog Casey. To get myself through the week I have 3 new netflix on their way, a roommate dinner tomorrow night, drinks on Wed. with friends, and many yoga classes to attend throughout.   I should also be spreading the word that Fahrenheit 9-11 is amazing and very important for everyone to see. It was a moving film, and it lacked the typical Michael Moore obnoxiousness. Jeff has offered to buy you a ticket if you're feeling reluctant, so hit him up and go see it!
I'm being really lazy today and laying around, nursing my sore neck and watching netflix. I didn't make it in to work today, and it seems that neither did two other chicas. Its just not a day for working - sorry to those of you out there slaving away at your desks.   I'm looking forward to the movie tonight - come back tomorrow for a review!
The #15 Thai Chicken from Specialty's is sooo delish. And if you're there, their cookies aren't too shabby either. Seriously people, a chicken breast, avocado, cucumber, carrots, lettuce, and yummy thai sauce... too good! A little messy, but worth the extra napkin effort.  I've got mine at my desk right now and am LOVING it!  Oh and my neck is feeling better. I went to yoga again today (I know, maybe not the best idea, but I was careful) and my instructor told me how to prevent straining it any further.   And a shout out to my medicine chicas that got me through our run last night by being goofy and jumping over concrete benches along the embarcadero. I love you both.  And check out a website one of the chicas told me about www.about-face.org for a non-profit that seeks to change negative images of women in our culture.
I'm feeling rather poo poo today b/c I did something stupid to my neck and its hurting. I can't turn my head to the right without sending pain down through my neck and back. I don't want to bore you with my whining... In other news, it looks like its going to be another busy weekend with a lot of visitors in town. Of course, I'm heading out to see Fahrenheit 911 on Friday night with the rest of the liberal masses. My question is; will this film be successful in affecting the upcoming election if only liberal sympathizers go see it? I really hope that its message also reaches those that haven't thought about these issues and not just in the form of a strong backlash. Someone recently told me how surprised a lot of people are to hear that none of the hijackers on 911 were Iraqi. I think a lot of people are u
