"Although you currently have a possition in an organization, in order to justify that possition you must demonstrate your value to the company on a daily basis. As a professional or knowledge worker, freeing yourself from an unhealthy dependence on the corporation and feeling, thinking, and acting like a Free Agent increase your value to your organization and in the marketplace." -- Free Agent (Published in 1997 by Jossey-Bass)
I bumped into my old client this morning. We used to do some consulting work for his agency, a statutory board. He seems well and quite happy. But he also told me that the whole government body is freezing and cutting down on head count, 3% reduction per year, or something like that. I wonder what would happen to all those civil service people? They can't be possibly go to private sector and try to make a living, can they? Well, they can try, but based on my past consulting experience with them, I doubt they can cut it. Probably only the top 10%-15% of the staff could make it in the private sector. As for the rest of 85%, well... come on boys come to private sector and we'll teach you a good lesson! In private sector we do real work, and not just paper work! We talk about real money here, not paper or budgetary money. We talk about real bottom line here, not just imaginery targets, numbers and statistics. So come onboard, and learn to swim while in the deep pool! No life guard here. Welcome to real life!
Yesterday, when I was having tea in a nearby mall, I overheard a conversation between a would-be supervisor and a newly hired. The supervisor was telling the newly hired how she could come in tomorrow morning, by which doors, who to look for, and the dress code too. The sound and feeling were all very familiar to me. It's the feeling of starting a new job in a new place. It just reminded me how I haven't got the feeling for a very long time. Perhaps I have stayed in my current job for a little bit too long. Perhaps I've become more lazy and less daring as the years go by. Perhaps I have more commitment and family responsibilities now compared to my younger days. Perhaps the economic is still not recovered yet, and no good jobs available out there. Perhaps... perhaps.
Motivation is a key for people to be productive. I notice in my colleagues, who are demotivated, that they don't actually putting much effort to get the work done. In fact, they tend to operate in a fire-fighting mode -- attending to the problem that create biggest fire. Not a very effective way of prioritising. But lately I too found myself to operate in this manner. I guess that would come a point where all of us the average employees would just give up on the management and just "switch off" and just do whatever we're told to do, without any additional initiative to make it better. What's the point? It seems like thinking and initiatives are rewarded only with criticism and more work, without the accompanying credits. Yes, there's such thing as self motivation, but this commodity is hard to come by these days.
We are knowledge worker, we create value and make things happen. That's what our Managing Director told us at the recent Staff Communication Conference. He told us that with competing pressure from India and China, we have to reinvent ourselves. Project Management and implementation used to be our forte. He told us that we have to move away from that and move up to the higher level of value chain. Nice talk. Feel good motherhood statements, of course.  We are about 200 strong consulting companies. Divided into many groups managed by Engagement Managers, who will have a number of Account Managers under him/her, depending how big the client is. So when come the EM and AM level, all those feel-good motherhood statements are fitting for trash bin only! We are hired for our skills, knowledge and experience. But the EM and AMs give us assignment and manage us as if we are factory workers. So why pay the premium of graduates with experience if you're not going to use what you're paying for? if it's just a pair of hands and legs that you need, you'll be better of hiring O-level or A-level staff. Even those with Diploma are over qualified. So is it any wonder if our clients are beginning to question our value? Are we worth what they are paying for? Would you hire graduate with 5-year experience to arrange for meetings and write minutes? We do!  So our big-shot Mr. MD up there, he certainly does not have any clue of what's happening at the ground level. Poor guy! He only know that our clients are not happy and not satisfied, but he has no clue why, and what more could we do to make them happy. Perhaps, it's not what more could we do, but rather what could we do and don't do that would deliver the value that they are really paying for. A deliverables that worth more than a fee that we charged them.
My pointy-haired boss was upset over the Maintenance Plan document that we updating late. So what's so important about this document that none of us make use of it for the whole year? Only to satisfy ISO-9000 requirement! Is this quality? Is this the quality that ISO-9000 was suppose to help us achieve? I feel like this ISO-9000 stuff is just another legalised world-wide scam, generating tones of money for the otherwise unemployed QA auditors. Because I really don't see how our customers would benefit from this Maintenance Plan that we draft on our own, then we approve it ourselves, and keep it in the folder for the whole year long. Once in a while when we're lucky to be picked for QA audit then the auditor might ask for it. Otherwise, it would be there c
