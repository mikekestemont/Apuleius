I would just like to wish the thousands, no millions of readers who visit my Blog a very special Independence Day. This is coming from a man who misspelled Independence not once but twice on MS Word. God bless America and the genius who created the Spell Check, wherever she may be. Yes, I said it. It was a woman. Who else would take such joy in correcting your every mistake, huh?  Anyways, I am posting this early because my computer at home is dead so all my Blogger entries will be made from the computer at work. And since I have the weekend off, I won't be back online until Monday, July 5th. Hopefully, in the near future I will purchase a new computer but for the time being I am stuck on this historic PC running Windows 95! Woo!  *cue fireworks*
There are just some songs that never leave your head no matter how much times passes by. This song is particular I heard for the first time about nine years ago. At the time I was in the last few years of my obsession with Hip-Hop/Rap. Up to then and on to about 1997, the genre was full of fresh, original talent. What Hip-Hop has become today is the equivalent to the Bubble Gum Pop that flooded the airwaves in the late 90’s. It’s sad that no one will ever pick up Goodie Mob’s Soul Food album, which I consider to be the greatest Hip-Hop album of all time. But that’s another post at another time.  The name of the song you must listen to before you die is Midnight. The artist? None other than Tracey Morrow, better known as Ice T. Now we know Ice T’s movie career hasn’t exactly been successful...unless your standards are about as low as a Mario Van Peebles fan. But back in his day, Ice T was pumping out Gangta’ tunes like there was no tomorrow. Unfortunately, Mr. Morrow decided to sell his soul to Hollywood in exchange for some C-Movie acting gigs.  So please, go download the song "Midnight" by Ice T off whatever illegal program you favor and afterwards check out this urlLink  link  to the lyrics (provided by Ohhla.com). If you enjoy what you hear and read, drop me a line and let me know!  The First In Many More To Come, mc80
Today we lost a true…hold up. Never mind. Fuck it.  I’m not going to write some bullshit article about a man I hardly knew. All I’m going to say is that I am a diehard movie fan and to this day have only had the pleasure of seeing three Marlon Brando films; On The Waterfront, The Godfather, and Don Juan DeMarco. Two of those three films, which I saw for the first time less than 3 months ago, are now in my top 10 favorites of all time.  From what I have read about Marlon Brando, I know that he was a rebel on screen and in real life. This is the man who actually turned down the Best Actor Academy Award for God sakes! It’s too bad his personal problems plagued him for so long. First his weight balloons, his legendary career stalls, his son murders a man, and finally his daughter commits suicide.  All I can say is that Marlon Brando will continue to live on in the hearts of  any  true movie fan. No, not the overweight, strange man from the last decade…but the Marlon who portrayed the over-the-hill boxer in On The Waterfront, or the one who not just portrayed but became Don Vito Corleone. I truly look forward to seeing the rest of his movie library.  With My Dying Respect, Mc80
This morning I awoke with about 30 minutes left in my shift. My sole purpose this morning (and every morning) was to avoid running into my boss who was fresh from his two week vacation and busy doing paperwork downstairs. I hadn’t shaved in about 2 weeks (a no-no in the Funeral Industry) and I knew if he saw me, I would be in deep shit. I managed to creep down through the front stairs of the Funeral Home (dark and empty at that time of the day), pick up my plates from the kitchen, grab my time card, punch out and sneak out through the front, undetected. Success! Or so I thought…  After exiting the Funeral Home I began my long drive home. As usual I drove below the speed limit, with my seatbelt on just like my grandmother Ursula would approve of. Why, you ask? Because I have 30 miles to drive, on three separate highways. That wouldn’t be so bad if it weren’t for the expired tag, on the car with no insurance, driven by the man with a suspended license  and  a criminal record. So yeah, once again the stereotype is correct. A Hispanic man with no insurance. What are the odds? Ha. Ha.  Anyways, once I got home and had some breakfast (rice, steak, biscuit) and played about an hour of Fight Night on the Xbox, I decided to take my usual nap of about five hours. Nothing really eventful happened in any of my first few dreams. No hot three-way action. No mc80 Vs. King Kong reoccurring dream that I usually get when I am stressed out. That is nothing interesting until my final dream. In this dream I see myself driving in my beat up, dirty, stinky, 2001 Pontiac Grand Am. I am minutes away from home on the I-75 observing the speed limit when a Florida State Trooper pulls up behind me. It didn’t take long for them to pull me over.  By this time I was sweating bullets. One walks up to my car on the driver side, while the other approaches on the passenger side. When I roll my tinted windows down to greet the officer I find it’s none other than my boss! On the other side, it’s his partner in crime (or the second boss at my work). My dream s
