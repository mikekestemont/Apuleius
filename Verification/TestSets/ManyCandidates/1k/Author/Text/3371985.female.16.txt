tell me if you're a   friendster addict  , you knows those who have 5-up accounts, literally have to have a  urlLink Xanga  account? im just wonderin really..kasi parang lahat meron na e..
The other day i watched   Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban™   ..alone.. But it was way astig!!! sobrang cool! Pero iba yung ending. It's not like what was written in the book. But anyways the SFX were cool! Then yesterday i watched   The Chronicles of Riddick™   *waaahhh* VIin Diesel's soo sexy!!!! But i didn't get to finish the film. Kasi po i was looking for someone to come with yesterday kaso di pwede si Rosa Isabel. Shermie wasn't replying. But in the middle of the movie my phone beeped. Twas Shermie! She said sorry coz she left her phone at home and she was at her mom's office. She asked kung pwedeng syang humabol and she did. So i didnt get to finish the film. But twas ayz. Its better naman to be with friends e.. besides the man beside me was creeping me out. Parang may gagawin kakaiba. Natraumatize na ko a ganyan e! Before i watched Mulan with my mom and bro. I was seated at the seat near the aisle. Then i man stood beside me, first i wasn't bothered then napansin ko may hawak sya!     OH MY GAWD THE MAN WAS MASTURBATING BESIDE ME!!!!!    *waaaahhhh* We invited Chantel to come to SM but took back her answer. Apparantly her friend has a gig on Megamall and she's going there. Nagtampo ko syempre. It's been such a long time na huli namin nakasama si Chantel. But then again she has her own life. So i leave you guys with a copy of me and Shermie's pictures at SM. ciao! ü
here's a copy of my old posts..   sO uHhMmM..aS of nOw tHiRd aNd fIrSt bOyFrIeNdS aRe MaKiN tHeiR mOvEs..iNvoLvInG gEtTiN bAcK tOgEtHeR..dUnNo wHo To cHoOsE nOr iF eVeR iM gOiN tO cHoOsE aNy oF tHe tWo. tHe fIrSt bOyFrIeNd,wEvE gOtTeN bAcK tOgEtHeR tWiCe aNd ThE tHiRd i tHiNk tHiS iS tHe fOuRtH tImE..hMmMm..vErY cOnFuSeD..  --------------------------------------  hurtin when i shouldn't be..  3rd x said he'd stay away coz i told him so..he didnt want to but he knows he's hurtin me..he has a girl in his life now..and said we were both important..that's why i told him i should stay away..for the girl's sake..he said he didnt want to..and now he agreed it sucks bigtime coz it's really hurtin me..i shouldn't be feelin this coz im the one who said we should part ways..but why am crying and why am i hurting..?  --------------------------------------  nEw GuY nEw LoVe..?!  new guy new love? waddya think..? he's nice..he can take my attitude..unlike some people out there! (stupid motherfuckers!) he wants me to go meet him..but i dont like the idea..i dont like age gaps either..he's 4 years older than me..i dont like age gaps..they have that maturity that i cannot still compensate with..but he knows how to go with my flow..he doesnt stray..i like talking to him..i keep on charging the cordless phone so i could talk to him at night coz he's got a job..BUT STILL I DONT LIKE THE AGE GAP! i text him every now and then.i misscall him all the time. wonders bout what he's doin'.gets mad at him when he doesnt reply. he says sorry when he doesnt. he acts like a child when he talks to me..immitates that of a baby i suppose..SO WADDYA THINK?! this new LOVE or just a gush of emotions..?  --------------------------------------  dilemma  currently facing a dilemma..the guy before was not in like with me but with someone else.actually he said he likes me but the one he likes aside from me came in the picture first so he likes her more than me.normally that would've been ego shattering in some way coz the reason was so "mababaw"?,but i couldn't care less now.he calls me at around 11 at night, just last night he did,just to tell me that he and the girl went out yesterday and the girl asked him to buy her something coz it was her birthday.of course he obliged.but after that the girl was giving him "alibys"(is this correct?!) like she can't talk to him yesterday coz her mom got mad at her for not coming home early and today she has some "interview" "workshop" or whatever that is,and she can't talk to him coz she won't be at home.he was restless.didn't know what to think,and i out of the goodness of my heart(yeah right),gave him advices.i didn't get irritated with ayt?i don't like him that much pa naman kasi.simple "like" lang.what irritated me was that he couldn't make up his mind! if he thinks the girl's just playin with him it would be better if he forgot her move on! ang kulit kasi nya! nakakaasar yung katatanung nya kung anung gagawin nya! in the first place kita naman nya yung ugali nung girl e! hingan ka ba naman ng load e di naman kayo magkakilala? DUH!?!? tas ngayon di sya mapakale kasi nakakapanghinayang daw. sobrang badtrip kasi katangahan nya yon! ako naman tanga din kasi kinausap ko pa! but that's not my actual dilemma.gusto ko lang magkwento.hahaha my real dilemma is that i like this guy,he says he loves me,but i think other wise..he hasn't seen me yet. ang lamang ko sa kanya is that i saw his picture na.kaya when i say i like him at least there's some truth in that diba?he's a known karirista...sinabi nya sakin lahat ng naging x nya,and some of them i've seen na..others i know..kaya nagdadalawang isip ako kasi lahat ng x nya sexy,maganda..yun bang pwedeng "irampa"? paginentertain ko yung feelings nya pareho lang kaming masasaktan.kasi gusto na nyang tumino e what if daw ako yun pinadala na magpapatino sa kanya.kaso yun nga di pa nya ko nakikita..what if magkita kami di nya ko gusto..e di umasa din ako..mas masasaktan ako kasi di naman ako yung mangiiwan..sya..diba?kaya nalilito ko..i like him..and im starting to fall..but as much as possible i
