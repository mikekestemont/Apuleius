Well, this evening was a strange adventure.  Through the poison-laced web of my mother's mind came a whisper of an idea that she should have dinner with me this week.  She called on Tuesday saying my father wanted to see me and have dinner but that he wasn't there at the moment.  I told her to tell him to call me when he was back so we could make an arrangement.  She said fine.  I got a call on Wednesday night from her saying they wanted to see me Friday.  I said perhaps, but that Thursday was better.  I mentioned that we should do an early dinner, and she said that was great.    Today, I called before I left work (5:30) to see what the status of things was.  Apparently my father was on business and wouldn't be able to leave before 6, which was fine.  An early dinner by 6:30 or 7 doesn't hurt at all.  Thus, I left work and went home expecting to hear from my parents at some point, informing me of their departure from home headed in my general direction.    At 9:00pm I still hadn't heard anything from my parents (I napped from 6:30... to prepare for the parental onslaught).  I called them to see what was the matter.  They said they were just leaving and they'd call me when they were near.  Fine, I say.  Starving.    At around 9:30 my mother phones from her mobile telling me that they are almost there, and I ask where we're going to dinner and if I should dress better-than-casual.  She nonchalantly mentions that they've had dinner already and that we were just going out for dessert and coffee...      Excuse me??     I waited for 4 hours, (not to mention that I'd had a particularly light lunch today) for coffee and dessert?!  I sputtered audibly on the phone, and just said "OK" and hung up.  My mother, font of charity that she is, showed up at my apartment door with a garbage bag - a garbage bag, in all its sagging, plastic glory - of "food" for my dinner.  Now, I'm not sure if it was the presentation (she was holding it out to me in that "ick" manner, as if the contents were precisely what any onlooker would expect a container of that sort to house) or the fact that upon opening the bag, I was greeted with two apples and four granola bars, that caused the vein in my left lobe to rupture.  But rupture it did, and with it my poise - my expression soured and I walked past her into the street voicelessly.    She asked if anything was the matter but I was determined not to make a point out of it.  However, she was.  She prodded and picked and pulled just like the mechanical harvester which made those lovely granola bars possible - and I, like the grain, yielded, then gave.    Yet after thirty minutes of calm conversation, she couldn't seem to grasp that there would be any reason to be annoyed.  So I became irate, just to help color the picture better.  I explained (again) that I'd been waiting four hours for them, and they didn't so much as give me the courtesy of a one minute phone call to tell me that they were going to, were in the process of, or had already, eaten dinner, yet waited until they were ten minutes away to tell me that I was to be having no dinner and only coffee and dessert.    Outrageous.  I'm one to talk though.  I dropped it as soon as I realized there was no point in chasing it.  My parents will never be on time. My parents will never "understand" me. My parents will never grant me common courtesies, because that would be "bending," and one doesn't bend for their children.  Other points to come soon.  Moving on- we went to an old haunt of my father's from his NYU days, but he was disappointed to see that it was under new ownership and wasn't as he remembered it.  What ensued was a very interesting tour of the general West Village area around MacDougal Street and the surrounding blocks, led by my dad and highlighting where the popular hangouts were, who worked where, what store was operated by what people and what the area looked like.  It was very very engrossing and I quickly forgot that it was in fact almost midnight.  Overall, good times, thanks to dad.
I have to say that I've been a bit less than wonderful at being on time to the office lately; it's been a combination of late nights spent not testing the limits of fun-having but instead braving the depths of late-night-food-eating coupled with hotter-than-hell temperatures and sweat-from-your-shins humidity.  Unpleasant.    Thus I went to bed last night without a dinner (which I've been eating, on average, around 11-12 lately) and with miraculously sleep-inducing weather (cool and breezy; everyone knows your body sleeps better in cooler temperatures).  I slept like a fat, French bond trader with his feet up at his desk at 2pm.  (very, very well.)  I woke up early this morning, refreshed, rested, and a little chilled, but comfortable.  I got into the shower early, which was great, until the hot water magically disappeared.  That was immediately followed by my shampoo being finished, my conditioner bursting everywhere, the water *still* being freezing, jumping out of the shower only to have a horrible morning shave, and getting to my closet in time to realize I was *late*.  As I shut the door to my room it grazed my achilles and tore off a small continent of flesh, right where my soon-to-be-worn shoes would rub for the rest of the day.  The train stopped for a full five minutes at every stop because of a broken door, there were bums in every car, and one fabulously headstrong black woman who was built like Buster Douglas didn't like the idea of other people being the first ones out of the train when we got to R
