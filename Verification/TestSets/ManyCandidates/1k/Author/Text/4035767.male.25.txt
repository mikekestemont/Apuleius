These days, among other projects, I'm working as a research assistant to a  urlLink professor  at the law school.  One goal of his project is figuring out whether  urlLink copyrights , the regime of intellectual property rights that Professor Cotter argued in a recent article in the  urlLink Florida Law Review  can be viewed as " urlLink memetic engineering ," stifles creativity by conferring broad rights on owners to control the uses of their works.  In other words, will this particular property rights regime lead to a lack of memetic diversity?    The idea is that memetic engineering is analogous to  urlLink centralized genetic engineering schemes , and as such comes with all the risks of such schemes.  Since  urlLink social engineers cannot foresee all the consequences of their actions  any more than genetic engineers, cannot be trusted to be virtuous, and do not have access to the information found in a disperse market, there are potentially catastrophic results, including memetic homogeneity.    So the question is, ultimately, how important is unpredictability in the creative process?  Since copyrights require negotiation and planning in advance, does that system stifle creativity?  Does copyright law preclude serendipity?  Is chance even necessary for creativity?  So if there are any  urlLink cognitive scientists ,  urlLink evolutionary psychologists ,  urlLink copyright lawyers ,  urlLink Hayek scholars , or any other interested parties, feel free to comment at will...
urlLink Apparently , the creators of the  urlLink hilarious cartoon parody  of "This Land is Your Land" are in hot water over potential copyright violations.  The music publisher that owns the song, The Richmond Organization, seems to think that  urlLink Guthrie's song , which of course has largely been forgotten by people who listen to music, will never recover from this blow.    "This puts a completely different spin on the song," said Kathryn Ostien, director of copyright licensing for the publisher. "The damage to the song is huge."  Well, maybe.  But I don't think it matters.  I think this falls pretty safely into the category of fair use.    But check out  urlLink Section 107 of the 1976 Copyright Act , and  urlLink this case , then decide for yourself.
I just watched the "Policy Shootout" between Michael Moore and Bill O'Reilly on "The Factor."  It was largely mindless, but my favorite part was this (paraphrasing):  O'Reilly: You claim in your film that Bush lied about WMD's.  But as it turns out, the CIA, British Intelligence and Russian Intelligence all agreed that Iraq had weapons,  and now the 9/11 Commission says that Bush didn't lie.  Will you apologize to President Bush?  Moore: No, because he lied.  O'Reilly: But he didn't lie, because he thought what he was saying was true.  Moore: He said something that wasn't true.  That's a lie.  O'Reilly:  It's a mistake, not a lie. . . .  A few years ago I went to see  urlLink Jacques Derrida  speak at UF.  HIs topic was "The History of the Lie."  All I (and others with whom I've spoken about this talk ) got out of it was "A lie is an  intentional  misrepresentation of the truth."  Thanks, Jacques.  That's deep, bro.  In any event, if my friend Casey (who sings for  urlLink Suicide Note ) mistakenly tells my friend  urlLink Cole  that Suicide Note is playing a show tomorrow night at  urlLink Common Grounds , and then Cole tells me, would I be justified in calling Cole a LIAR when I found out the information wasn't true?        Michael Moore is an idiot.  And he's desperately slow on his feet.  Kudos to O'Reilly for getting the interview, but he loses points for dropping the ball on the threat Iraq posed to the U.S.
Last summer I had the privilege to work for John Stossel at ABC News in New York.  A few years before that Stossel gave a report on organic foods.  To bolster his claim that organic foods were no safer than other kinds of foods, Stossel cited pesticide residue tests he claimed ABC conducted.  Later, he learned that the pesticide tests were not conducted (the tests were for bacteria, not pesticides).  Like most of the errors in journalism, the mistake was innocent.  Soon after discovering his oversight, Stossel retracted the statement with apology, and he still regrets the error.    Despite his admission and apology, leftist special interest groups swarmed to attack Stossel.  A spokesperson for the “Environmental Working Group” said, “Stossel lied and threatened an entire industry by disseminating false and damaging information.”  Many activists even demanded that Stossel be fired.  Some argued that the activists had been simply longing for the opportunity to demand the head of their Emmy-winning ideological opponent.  Others said they were merely performing the noble task of keeping the mainstream media honest.    Assuming the latter was the true motivation, it is curious that such truth crusaders are conspicuously silent with respect to Michael Moore’s film, “Fahrenheit 9/11.”  The errors, distortions and lies in Moore's film have been  urlLink thoroughly chronicled   urlLink elsewhere , so there is no need to recap them here.    The left called for Stossel's head because he said "pesticide" instead of "bacteria."  And the loudest, most obnoxious charge the left makes against President Bush is that he "lied" about Iraq (actually, the    most    obnoxious is the "war for oil" kookery).  So it is interesting to note that no person of importance on the left has even called for a retraction from Moore.  He'll even be speaking with some prominent Democrats (including Howard Dean) at a rally in Boston this week.  Responsible journalists admit error and immediately retract untrue statements, usually with apology.  Similarly, intellectually honest people recognize error even when it exists on their side of the aisle.  Instead of setting up "war rooms" and threatening detractors with lawsuits, Moore should apologize and retract his error-filled film.  Similarly, responsible Democrats should demand it from him.
My very dear friends, and awesome band, Escape Grace, will be out on the road for three weeks, starting Saturday, the 31st.  If you live in these areas, go check them out, feed them, and house them.  They're awesome, a
