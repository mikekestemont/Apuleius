This would mark the first time for me to post on this blog. I have posted on several blogs previously, though most of them are dilapidated and decayed due to ill-usage and now lies abandonded in the eternal abyssal darkness called the Internet. Hopefully, this one does not share the same fate as its predecessors.   And with all beginnings, I suppose that an introduction is in order. By this point, should you feel the need to leave, please click on the little box with the large "X" on the upper right-hand side of your browser, thus effectively banishing my unsightly little blog away from your existence.  Now where was I? Oh yes, and introduction...  My name is Shahriman Latif. At the time of writing, I am merely a month away from turning twenty three years of age. And for the inept, or absent minded, I am the writer of this blog you now are starting at. This is evident by the fact that I am actually writing it. If someone else was writing it, then it would be someone else's blog, definitely not Shahriman Latif's.  I've been told, as is evident by now, that I tend to be long winded when trying to reach for a point in something. I would take all the possible turns, go through all the possible alleyways, make all possible stops, and lull whoever it was that was unfortunate enough to listen to my ramblings or read then, into an overwhelming sense of boredom and utter impatience, before arriving to my point.  And usually there was no point to begin with, or the point I was going for was lost even to me during the long and arduous journey of my getting there.  I am presently living in a rather peaceful urban area named Subang Jaya, which is a province of sorts, in the state of Selangor, of which is part of the Federation of States of Malaysia.  In short: I live in Malaysia. I live about fifteen to two-hours (depending on traffic conditions) from Kuala Lumpur, the capital city of Malaysia.  I am currently pursuing a Law Degree from the Universiti Teknologi MARA, of which I discover myself about two semesters overdue from graduating. Dropping papers and whatnot, thus delaying my impending graduation. I've always been a slow learner, so this rather disturbing fact doesn't really disturb me much. Surprisingly.  I suppose in doing something, one must have a purpose or a reason to do whatever it is that he/she is doing that something. I shall now reveal to you the purpose of my writing this blog:  1)  As a cure for boredom . I am currently on a semester break, which spans a massive three months plus. Not that I'm complaining about having all this free time, though. On the contrary, I find it rather refreshing. I get to correspond with some of my friends, and they prove to be brilliant in accomodating me and my personal quirks and random opinions.  2)  As a testament to my ever changing mental health . I would like to be able to look back at what I was thinking about when I was thinking about it. And I find that putting it down in the form of writing (the greatest form of communication that we have, in my opinion, as the ability to read and write seperates us from lesser beings on this planet) is the best form of retrospection (is that even a valid word?) available. When we recall from memory we tend to paint it with more excitement and color (as we are detached emotionally from the moment itself), thus rendering us a fairly inaccurate remembrance of how it really was when it happened. We sugar coat our memories so that we would recall  the good old days , when it fact the good old days were not that particularly good originally. As such, with my distrust of my own capacity to remember things correctly, I feel the need to write this blog as a testament to whatever it is that I think of at that   exact  moment. And then in the future, I am able to read what I've written, and maybe laugh at myself or bury my head in shame at my previous, written, foolishness. Or revel at my written genius. Though, if I knew me as well as I know me, this blog shall hold much more of my folly than my brilliance.  3)  To express my opinions on various matters . I do not think that this requires any further explaination, as it is rather self-explainatory, don't you think?  4)  Something to amuse my friends with . Apparently, a lot of the people I know seem to enjoy whatever it was that I was writing. Surprisingly, a few people are genuinely amused by my expression of idleness and boredom. I shall take this as a compliment, that people would actually take the time to read and digest whatever that comes out of my twisted mind into writing. As such, I am probably doing this to amuse and please my friends more than anything else. Because friends are important to me. I cherish them with all my heart. Even if I sometimes come out as an arrogant prick and treat them like dirt.  And so there is it. My introduction of sorts. If you've read all of it, then I am eternally grateful for you time and patience. If you haven't read this up to the end, then you probably won't realise me calling you an asshole. Not that you're really an asshole. It's just a term of endearment for me about you, the one who did not finish reading my introductory entry till the end.  And this is the end, by the way. For now. Thank you.
And so I find myself turning twenty three today. Happy Birthday to me, then. I don't really hold much importance on my birthday (though I know better than to disregard other people's birthdays), but I do have to admit that it does get you t
