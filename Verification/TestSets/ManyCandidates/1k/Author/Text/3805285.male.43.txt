Edger Hoover and Senator Joe McCarthy again.&nbsp; Hoover never trusted anyone, and had anyone even the slightly suspicious under surveillance.&nbsp; McCarthy and his “Red Scare” commission were worried about the communist attacking us from within.&nbsp; I hate to say it folks, but he was prophetic about being attacked from within but it wasn’t the communist, but the terrorist.&nbsp; And what have we done since 9/11/01?&nbsp; They make advances toward more security but then do stupid stuff that undermines what they’ve tried to accomplish.&nbsp; If Mr. Hoover and Mr. McCarthy were alive today, they would have rounded up every undocumented alien, ever student with an expired visa, anyone who didn’t legally belong in the US and sent them packing.&nbsp; Back before the year 1984, people were worried that Orwell’s book by that title would come true and “Big Brother” would be watching our every move.&nbsp; If there was a “Big Brother”, we wouldn’t have to worry so much about al-Quaida or OBL.&nbsp; It’s a balancing act, weighing civil liberties with national security.
urlLink Berger   &nbsp;It seems strange that a former Security Advisor would go into the National Achieves and take documents that were not suppose to leave the reading room.&nbsp; Not only that, but to have made copies of these high security documents seemed highly irregular.&nbsp; Then for him to have removed some of the original documents and have to either recklessly misplaced or thrown such documents out, shows what kind of security this Nation has.  &nbsp;Could it be that Mr. Berger was trying to as they have been saying, re-write history?&nbsp; To take out evidence of some serious lapses in our national security that might have been the signs of thing to come?&nbsp; We may never know because these documents will never be recovered.&nbsp; Or could it be that Mr. Berger was gathering information that the Kerry camp needed, to use in their Presidential Campaign?  &nbsp;Mr. Berger should face criminal charges for theft of government property.&nbsp; His position of former Security Advisor to Clinton should have taught him the importance of security.&nbsp; But this shouldn’t surprise too many people; after all, the President of the United States, back in 1972 broke the law.&nbsp; I don’t believe that anyone in the government is totally honest.
urlLink MONTGOMERY ADVERTISER.COM   Was Hooper acting as a concerned citizen or as Chief Wilson suggest. as a disgruntled fromer police officer seeking revenge for being fired?  And if you saw the interivew on WSFA-TV news when they met up with Hooper at the court house, he was getting a pistol permit and saying his reason was that he saw what happened to Serpico (  urlLink SERPICO ), so yes he feared for his life.  I think Hooper is delusional. Serpico broke up a major narcotics ring in the NYPD, not caught the police chief driving after have a drink.
How is this for national security? Two hard drives full of classified data are missing from the weapons section at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.  And this is not the first such incident to occur at this highly sensitive lab.  Four years ago, almost to the exact day, two other hard drives were reported missing. At that same time, two floppy discs were missing but later found attached to a paper in another secure area. And a door was left unlocked.  	Then in December 10, 2003, it was reported in the Mercury News that nine floppy discs and one large capacity disc were reported missing.  Although the University of California’s vice president of laboratory management stated that the disc did not contain classified data, he couldn’t be sure until he found them.  	Even last month, keys to area 18 were reported missing for 16 hours.  The guards changed shifts twice before the keys were located in a security truck under some equipment that wasn’t moved during the prior searches.  This lab contains enriched uranium and other nuclear material, but these security lapses is causing the government to think about moving the material the Whites Sands, New Mexico, where security is better.  	I don’t know why the government tolerates so many incidents before they take action.  Look at the space shuttle Challenger in 1986.  It was discovered that the O rings were at fault and that Morton Thiokol knew about the gases leaking around the O rings and didn’t stop the shuttle missions.  Yet even after they were proven responsible, NASA still let Morton Thiokol have the shuttle contract.  Why should they err on the side of safety?  You can kill seven astronauts and still have the contract.  	Here, Los Alamos is a danger to national security.  How many security lapses will it take before they move the lab to another more secure facility?  Does someone have to die first?  No, because its been shown that even death doesn’t mean you will lose a government contract.
Most people know I love history.  Well here is a bit of history that has come back to bite the USA in the butt, so to speak.   A law written in 1789, called the Alien Tort Claims Act , which was originally written to fight piracy, is being used by foreigners, to use American courts to sue for human right violations overseas.  	Right now the victims of the Abu Ghraib prison abuse are using the law to sue the private contractors that were running the prison.  But the law has been used in other cases.  Holocaust survivors used the law against the Swiss banks to retrieve assets t
