So Ren and I went golfing today with Big Dave - wow were the scores all over the place though!  Dave shot 141, I think ren settled somewhere in the 124 range, and I rounded out 18 with a 93 (my front nine really licked ass though).  Though it was a little cold, nice day for golf!  Tmrw is the last hurrah social, coupled with golfing in the early afternoon, I'm going to be absolutely fusched!
So I guess that the world is again trying to conspire against me making my ridiculous comments on blogs.  For some reason or another the comments feature does not exist on this blog at the University of Manitoba.  Nor am I allowed to comment at home as my goatfuck computer will no longer allow popup windows to actually contain anything but ads.  Fucking Bullshit.  On a happier note, today is my last exam, 6 of 6 at 6pm.  Hmmmmm.... that's a lot of 6s.  A beastly amount.  Then I will forsake my Pharmacy crew for my old pal sickboy and drink with him this fine eve.  I think we should bring the narg and some cushions and sit in a circle in the lane behind the Camby.  We should whip up a batch of bathtub gin for the occasion.  Then get in a fight, perhaps with eachother or go to the Zoo and real man challenge each other to do fight animals, or outdo them at stuff the animals excel at.  We could challenge Sean to outgay a bonobo.  They whack off too I think.  A'ight.  Last ditch effort to lern.  (Spelling perhaps).
I'll see your lesbian deific fantasies, and raise you 2 mystic hermaphrodites and a dog from space.
Sitting here, wondering what it would be like to be a lesbian.  I mean, it's not as crude as the gay sex.  It's certainly beautiful (as we can all attest to that after a good boobwatch viewing).  Lesbians must really love their V's.  They love them so much that they want two... I mean, us guys can all agree that we love our cocks.  We can fiddle with them, scratch them, do everything thing we want to them... but (contrary to popular belief) I certainly don't want another one.  However, I do understand the wanting two V's thing... as their has been many a dream where I had two at my disposal (I was a greasy V repairman - "my business is pussy, and business is good" was always said about a hundred times).  Now, if you were born a hermaphrodite - and you had the choice to be either a male or a female... and if female, straight or lesbian... which do you think you'd pick?  I would have to go for the lesbian thing... have a V of my own, and get to try out others every now and then... the best of one world, but oh what a world though!  Next question, if you could be God for a day and make one thing happen... anything at all - it can be a selfish desire, a sexual fantasy, peace on earth... anything... what would you do?  I think Steve would change the Bible so that Jesus was changed to Steve... (flaw in that being the whole "Jesus wept" thing... think about it - if you were Paul or Peter or John or whoever wrote the thing(thing = Bible), sitting there with your bottom ho writing that sentence... wouldn't you think "Holy Fuck, the Messiah's a pussy!)  So, yeah, why are you crying Stevie boy?  huh?  Your father has "fro"saken(that's when your daddy shaves your head, just before the all-knowing fro realises its full potential) you or what?  Lost in a dessert? - get a fucking map!  Mary Magdelaine your best friend but you can't nail her - well grab a willy wrapper and slam that bitch... things we could say if Steve was the Lord and Saviour (because we're his buddies)... it's too bad we weren't best pals with Jesus - it'd be great... we could have him on our bowling team, walking from lane to lane explaining that this isn't the pedophile jesus, this is the son of God Jesus.  We would for sure get into Heaven, and we wouldn't wait at the gate - we'd have V.I.P. passes, and gain back door entry (hehe).  That's the real reason that Peter denied him thrice - he just couldn't handle all the tang that comes with being a best friend of a God.  Those fishermen screwed the rest of us over though - they hated their jobs and asked Jesus for a hand - so he tried his magic shit... but instead of making fish smell like pussy, it went the other way around.  He was young, he was still trying to control everything... I wonder what I'd ask for... probably a 24 hour sushi train at every street corner.  That and I'd get a manager's discount, cause you know... God would run the joint - and it would be the best ever!  Plus, coming of age would no longer be defined by your first fuck - rather it would be the ultimate RMC.  I would just have to open up a chain of Key Lime Pie bakeries.  Although, God would probably be brought up on anti-trust charges, and he'd have to split his kingdom on earth and in heaven into two separate parts.  So we'd have "Heaven XP" and "Heaven 2003" - both would work well, but it would be frustrating switching back and forth - a lot of deprogramming to do for either one.  Plus, Hell would just be a short walk down the road...
I think that what we really need is a simple pentapartite structure for all that organization stuff.  We need a crime wing, a propaganda/memetic engineering division, a bureau of data mining, a holy funk church, and something else [open to suggestions, I just think it should have 5 parts altogether] all dedicated to getting jokes (even the crime wing whose secondary purpose is funding the rest of them).  I
