Well this is going to be my last one for sure...it's sorta starting to kick in now. i'm starting to really realise that i will infact be away from emily for a long time...it's gonna be tough if i could barely even handle it for 5 days. well i was informed one time a long time ago that length of time can be perceived differently on how much you are enjoying the time. the more fun you have, the faster time goes...so i guess i'd better have fun unless i want time to go by really slowly and then feel like shit...meh i guess there are some lyrics that can sum up what i feel: I know i'll see you again, whether far or soon. but i need you to know. that i care, and i miss you I miss you, Incubus Everytime i tried to tell you the words just came out wrong, so i'll have to say i love you in a song. I'll have to say i love you in a song, Jim Croce Two weeks without my lover. i'm floating in the boat alone. floating down a river called emotion Aqueous Transmission, Incubus"  So yeah that was about it...well i'm gonna miss my friends ,my blog but most of all emily. i truly believe that what we have can never be undone...just like a double knot in my shoes...ha ha ha emily will get it. (8) Goodbye fairwell...uhh dun dun dun dun crapiforgotthewoooooooooorrrdddssssA! Sam
well blog. you've been good to me. you've listened to my constant bickering and whining about...this and that. you know the old stuff. but i'm sure if you had the ability to mute me you would, but guess what? YOU DON'T!! ahh ha ha ha MY FACIST PARTY RULES THIS BLOG WITH AN IRON FIST! MUAH HA HA HA!!! anyways getting off a huge acid trip...last night i hung out with ninja and evan...we stayed up until about 6:30...saw the sun come up...made me reflect on things...you know...just what's going on with me now. but in the end it wasn't that smart of an idea i mean...i had to get picked up at 8:30 for a trumpet practice...meh. as usual I get very little sleep but for some reason i do shitloads better than i do when i get good sleep...hmm can we say negative influence? yeah it went well...except that i won't get a lesson until september...meh.   So yeah...this is probably going to be my last post until july 24th...it seems like so far away, but i'm hoping it will go faster. it's sorta weird though saying goodbye to people you won't see for a month...but it's sorta like, you have to do it so you might as well do it how you want to.  Well i'm gonna sign off now. i'm eating a hotdog with spices and such everywhere...and i'm gonna watch Love Actually...hmm i've noticed i like watching love films now...i guess that's cool..i mean for emily's sake.

Well ladies and you men who are gentle...(otherwise known as gentlemen)i have done it...but i can't say that it was me who started...infact i don't believe i did...but i've now talked about it with emily...and frig does it ever feel good. the whole night started out with emily actually getting to my house first. tamsen and the rest of them, me and emily have decided, were an hour late intentionally. so we hung out with tamsen lisa and hannah for a while then they had to go because " we have to be back at hannah's house soon". *sigh* could you be anymore obvious? yeah then they left...then we left when they were still on the street...he he he getting right down to business...then we walk over to a park and we were swinging..on...can you guess? that's right the swings. and then we were talking to eachother for a while and then we started hinting about what we should've talked about...then she said "so do you wanna talk about it" i said "YES". ha ha ha i liked it though. i mean we talked for like 30 minutes about us and how everyone acted with us a lot...and other things and such...i don't think i should go into full detail for privacy purposes. then we walked home. and on the way to my house on Alma her mom drove by and onto the wrong street...i felt bad because i thought we wouldn't actually be able to say goodbye to eachother...then emily did the greatest thing...she said "ohh can you meet us at his house in like 3 minutes?" effing gold emily! effing gold! so we walked around the long way...and her mom was waiting at the curb and before she started to poke me and so i took her hand and we held hands for when we walked then when we saw her mother we went behind the bush and we hugged for a while...and damn i was in heaven. i mean i just wanted to stay there the entire time then we went around the corner...said goodbye and that was it...and as of like 11:45 me and emily have been talking and trading pictures...and it's soo awesome. i also got her adress so that when i'm gone i can send her snail mail...but i don't think she knew at the time...that i'm doing it every day! yar har har har. now this is sam's post scriptum but i've been informed that i should only send one a week. and i shall abide but you can't always play by the rules...yeah the hug was awesome though...i can still smell her...*sigh* i'm in love! Sam
well i've slept on it...and i am now less pissed off at myself for what i didn't do. and more happy for what were able to do! i mean we even hinted about what we were talking about. and everyone else with us was really obvious that they were trying to set something up "ok we're gonna play sardines, but we're playing in pairs. now sam and emily have t
