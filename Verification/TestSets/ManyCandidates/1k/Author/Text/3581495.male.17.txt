Don't you find it really shitty that time only flies when you're having fun. This, meaning that the majority of your life is spent not having fun, since time feels longer when you're not having fun. Would it not make more sense if time went slower when you're having fun so that you can enjoy it a little bit more? When you're not having fun and time is flying by, then who really gives a damn if not much fun is being had by one or more, or maybe all party members. Time is flying by so not to much of it is wasted doing things that are not really all that fun. Think about it.  How long do trees live? From a human being's point of view, the tree seems to live forever because it will survive far beyond my lifetime. So, trees live a really long time to us, but do they ever die. Since trees don't have any organs, then there is nothing to limit its proper function. By this I mean that animals are limited in age because our organs grow old. When the organs become old they don't work as well, so we eventually die. But the tree doesn't have this. Can we assume that it can live forever? If the tree is left undisturbed for a really long time, such as the pine tree in Tasmania that people thought was many trees because it covered 2.5 hectares but was in fact one huge tree which is dated at 10,500. Even though this is a hypothetical age because they probably cant find the main trunk to do a core dating thing where they count the rings. Core dating from some of the limbs show 4000 years which is not the oldest age for a tree but Is still pretty damn old. It is the oldest living organism on Earth. I guess this means that the tree left undisturbed will never die. Think about that next time you look at some trees.   I really hate people who go around town in their cars, by themselves, playing really bad music really loud. I can't stand it and it makes me mad. I was walking down the street today and at an intersection there is a dumbass in his crappy car, singing to the gayest song I have ever heard in my life. Naturally he was wearing a baseball cap turned backwards, a t-shirt which had the sleeves cut off, and a pair of sunglasses. I can't forget to mention that he had his arm out of the open window. I bet he thought he was the shit. I think he looked stupid but I guess I obviously can not represent the opinions of the population since I am one person.

If the watermelon is pricked with a needle, does it not cry? The watermelon has feelings sometimes too easy to crush. When its confidence is reduced to muffin crumbs underneath a table in a cheap diner, it will weep. These Tears formidable to the eyes of most, due to the melon's 92% water content. If this watermelon were of gigantic proportions, it might even cry out lakes with their own little network of veins and capillaries. These lakes would eventually become the home for millions of living things. The birds would eat the bugs; the bugs would eat the poo from the butt of the Elk. The Elk, which is often shat on by the birds, eats berries from the bush. The bush gets its water a few feet bellow the ground which most probably came from the lake. In the lake there are fish. The fish, who also eat bugs, are in fierce competition with the birds. Some birds, such as the eagles, really don't care about the bugs and go strait from the fish. I've never seen a fish eat a bird. I bet sharks could do it.   Being a shark, I would lure the bird with the tip top of my tail. The tail looking like the end of a grey worm sticking out of the water would only attract the dumb birds like seagulls. The eagle, who isn't as stupid as his shit eating, shitting cousin, would not be lured due to its awesome vision and ability to see past the surface. The dumb shitting seagull would not be able to resist the plump grey worm. That juicy worm would be its last for little does it know that the worm is actually a great white looking for a dumb and easy meal. With a flick of its powerful scaly body and a single debilitatingly crushing bite with its hundreds of jagged shark teeth, the seagull is consumed. The poor dumb thing died so fast. So quickly in fact, it is simple to think that it may not have felt anything.   Does the fact that you die very quickly make any difference to the amount of pain you feel. A powerful question, it lingers in my mind. It seems like time takes a slightly slower pace when one is in peril. Maybe a hormone or something in our brain makes it record data a few times faster in order to create this illusion. The reason, of course, would be for the one in peril to have more time to think of how to get out of it. Getting back to pain, if collection of data occurs faster when the individual is in danger, then the quick death actually feels a lot longer then it truly is. Therefore I can make the conclusion that, assuming my theory is correct, dieing quickly does not really save you from that much pain. If you had a pain fetish, you'd probably like it. And you are very weird!  Some people say that life is a circle. That, what goes around comes around. Others believe in the circle of life, that everything is interdependent. Others really like t
