Yesterday, President Bush came to Phoenix to speak to his supporters.  My friend made 75 phone calls at the Bush/Cheney headquarters, so she got 4 VIP tickets. She invited me and my son to see George W. Bush and other speakers.  We were thrilled!
"The Almighty God has blessed our land in many ways.     He has given our people stout hearts and strong arms with which to      strike mighty blows for freedom and truth. He has given to our country      a faith which has become the hope of all peoples in an anguished world.      So we pray to Him now for the vision to see our way clearly-to see the      way that leads to a better life for ourselves and for all our fellow men—     to the achievement of His will to peace on earth."             --Franklin D. Roosevelt      Remember our troops in prayer today as they battle the enemy all around them. Ask God to lift them up high upon the Rock and protect them with His mighty Right Hand.      ********************************************************************   From  urlLink  Drudge:       U.S. forces say they have killed 360 Sadr loyalists so far in Najaf. Sadr's spokesmen say far fewer have died in what is the second rebellion by the militia in four months.  So, we'll have to rely on what our soldier and Iraqi bloggers say about the battle to know the truth.........as usual.  ***********************************************************************************  John Kerry: Flip-Flopper of all time!         urlLink  George F. Will     on the subject of Kerry's flip-flops:    "But what's really troubling is the distinct impression that Kerry remains haunted by Vietnam syndrome — which leads one to wonder whether a President Kerry would be prepared, if necessary, to commit to using military force to defend this nation."      Read more  urlLink  here.            NYT has some interesting tidbits about Kerry's flip-flop on the war  urlLink  here.       "So far, his aides and advisers concede, he has failed to get his message across, as Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have mocked his efforts as "a new nuance" that amount to more examples of the senator's waffling."  **********************************************************************************   Iraqi Soldiers are doing  urlLink  their job  , insensitively........must make John Kerry angry!         "BAGHDAD - Joint Iraqi Police Service, Iraqi National Guard, and U.S. Special Forces operations in Al Kut, Aug. 11, against Mehdi Militiamen may have broken the back of anti-Iraqi forces in the city, according to the city's governor,The actions came after Iraqi police stations and other government buildings were attacked and overrun in some cases.      The fighting culminated in one area when Iraqi guardsmen and police launched an assault across the Tigris River in a small boat under machinegun fire and retook a key bridge in the city. Iraqi forces continue to hold the bridge."     Read the whole message....it is great news!  ******************************************************************************    urlLink  More   on Stem Cell Research:     Stem cell reporting is usually incorrect.  From a 37 yr.old with Parkinson's disease:  (PRWEB) August 1, 2004 -- "Everyday I read articles and watch newscasts pertaining to President Bush and his "non-support" of stem cells, these are very misleading. There is no total restriction on stem cell research in the United States. The restrictions imposed are for "embryonic stem cell research" only and the policy only restricts utilizing federal funds (our tax dollars) for embryonic stem cell research. Adult stem cell research is open to federal funding , along with some embyronic, and scientists are free to use private funding to pursue embryonic research and have been doing so with great success as seen by the number of Universities opening up research laboratories..

"Yes, Saddam Hussein was a horrible man, evil, terrible man and it is a good thing we got rid of him, but......"  -Typical Liberal diatribe regarding the War in Iraq.    I am currently reading a book about   urlLink  The Rape of Nanking,    by Iris Chang.  In 1937, the Japanese invaded and conquered China at Shanghai. From there, they made their way to Nanking....slaughtering hundres of thousands of people along the way. Those that were not slaughtered were enslaved. Thousands of women were taken as "comfort women" or sex slaves. They were used as slaves to possible thousands of Japanese soldiers over and over again.  There were reports of cannibalism because the Japanese ran out of food supplies for its military. The men resorted to eating the dead Chinese.  These horrific tales were not written or spoken about for many years. The Rape of Nanking is not mentioned in many history books or memoirs of World War II.  I ask: Why?  Last week, on the Rush Limbaugh show, a caller stated that we Americans should pause and reflect on the 59th anniversary of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He implied that we, America, should feel sad and guilty for what happened on those days.  In a recent post on this blog, I wrote about the Bataan Death March survivors and what they experienced. What I did not write was what event in history freed them from their captors: the Japanese.  The boming of Hiroshim and Nagasaki ended the war with Japan and freed the thousands of American POWs in Japan. Many survivors said that had those bombs not landed, they probably had only days left to survive. They were more than happy for the bombings.  It is reported that 170,000 people were killed on Aug 6 and Aug. 9th 1945 in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. That is indeed a tragedy....but many military strategists predicted that over million Japanese and American soldiers would have been killed in the land assault that would have taken place if the bombs were not dropped. Many survivors of the POW camps predicted that their guards would have killed all of the POW's to hide the evidence of cruelty.  So, the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki indeed saved millions of lives.  But why did the caller say that we, Americans, should reflect on those historical events when 170,000 people were killed?.....and yet no mention of the Rape of Nanking is ever mentioned for its anniversary when  350,000  people w
