I have recently been forwarded quite a few 'urban legends'; you know the things, people found with their kidney removed in the bath, perfume samples that are ether, etc.&nbsp;   Now the logical side of me likes to think that they truly are just that ... legends.&nbsp; But then somewhere in the recesses of my mind; some primal dark spot that likes to whisper when your not quite listening, starts to insist ...    'what if they're not?&nbsp;      How do we truly know??'   And an even more scary thought is ...    'what if some bright spark reads the legend, and gets&nbsp; ideas????'     It can all become rather daunting to be honest - and I feel that this is where the power of the mind can truly help us; call&nbsp;me kooky if you wish, but I truly believe that what you think about, what you insist on pouring your mental (or psychic) energy into, will eventually become real.&nbsp; Will 'manifest' itself if you will, into something tangible and in this reality.   Basically, you get what you ask for!   I remember being a silly sixteen year old.&nbsp; Ten foot tall and bullet proof, walking down the streets of Salford in Manchester, England,&nbsp;at two in the morning.&nbsp; I also remember the look of sheer disbelief on the faces of the young blokes huddled on a corner on this particulary bad neighbourhood (one where you would definitely NOT want a sixteen year old girl walking alone); especially when I said 'hello' in my sing song happy voice.&nbsp; Quite hilarious when I think back!  I remember being so full of self confidence; so sure of my safety and of the world being a GOOD place, that I have wondered on many occasions if that, in itself, is the reason I walked, unharmed, though this neighbourhood where drugs, prostitution, and gang warfare was the norm.&nbsp;   I believe this is a&nbsp;gift that should be enhanced, should be encouraged and allowed to grow within our culture, and especially within our youth.  I strongly believe that if you are worried about the things that CAN harm you, it gives those things power, feeds them if you will.&nbsp; If you constantly worry about becoming a statistic, you run the risk of actually becoming one.  So, instead of worrying about ether on perfume samples, or checking for previously unkown scars around the lower back area, or even worrying about walking to the corner shop for some milk, &nbsp;maybe we should work more on the positives we wish for.&nbsp; Knowing that it is only a matter of time before they come to us.&nbsp; The trick is not to ask in a whimsical fashion (I wish I had more money, love, power, happiness, etc), but to be THANKFUL for the things that you have, even if they are not manifested at this moment in time.&nbsp;    I believe the things we pour our energies into are the things we eventually end up with.  This self fulfilling prophecy is so simple, and yet so powerful, we usually ignore this basic law.&nbsp; And yet within this law lies our own personal freedom.&nbsp;  Why do we ignore it?&nbsp;  I believe it is due to layers of 'filters' being put in front of&nbsp;our eyes&nbsp;over the years.&nbsp; Our culture, families, upbringing, contact with the outside world.&nbsp; How we 'see' things.&nbsp; The whole shabang!!! The key is to recognise the filters for what they are, remove them, and move on.&nbsp; This is a constant process, as we are subject to filters on an everyday basis, so ...  It will&nbsp;only takes a lifetime :D  Of course, the anceint words of folklore that have, in themselves, ended up wrapped within legends,&nbsp;ring true here ...    BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU ASK FOR, YOU MIGHT JUST GET IT!    until next time  Ka Kite Ano (see you again :D)
It's quite interesting that this is the third blog account&nbsp;I have set up and the only one I can still find! &nbsp; I am a tad concerned where the other blog accounts have gone to ... is there a blog cemetry?&nbsp; Am a blog murderer???!!! &nbsp; Ah well.&nbsp; I'm over it!&nbsp; I never was one for a long stretch of guilt.&nbsp; I am soldiering on trying to catch up (and not even keeping up) with technology - it is such a standing joke in my family that I have long been known as 'techno-phobic!'&nbsp; Slightly ironic as I am mad on techno music but technically illiterate!&nbsp; I just dance OK?  &nbsp; Quite exciting all this though isn't it?&nbsp; To think someone out there in massive cyber-space may one day be so bored they stumble on the sad ramblings of a technically challenged dance freak who loves New Zealand and is into tourism and life enhancing workshops!&nbsp; That is of course, assuming I manage to get this one published and don't kill it off along with it's earlier siblings! &nbsp; Here's hoping - and if this one survives I may even get a chance to add more tomorrow ... &nbsp; Until then &nbsp; Ka Kite Ano (see you again)

Another highly absorbing and thought provoking exhibition opened on Wednesday in Hamilton;  Two talented women joined forces for their exhibition opening at the New Media Show in Hamilton, New Zealand this week.    The first was Maree Mills (lecturer in video production and experimental video at University of Waikato). Her installation  'Hau: breath/wind'  explores  "communication of ethereal and/or cosmological concepts inherent in the Maori world view, f
