SO much FUN.  Okay, now that I'm not totally fucked up, go  urlLink here  to get my scoop, so I don't have to type a bunch of stuff over again.  It's somewhere in that entry, under crap about church and all.  So...yeah.  I love my friends.  I want to go to the park now.  Dammit, I don't have anyone to go with.  No one is online.  -zr/k
I woke up this morning to a small hangover for over consumption of chocolate and other great things. Hopefully my Birthday Bash will be as great as that one!    "Do you like your coffee like your men?  Dark and strong?" "No...white and sweet."    "I am so FUCKED up!"  "What's wrong Mary?" "She doesn't like fleshy things" "COVER UP THE CHICKEN!  AAARRRGGHHHHH"  *watches Karyn zip around the kitchen with dirty plates while I stuff my face with chocolate strawberries and bananas*  Ahh...yes...random quotes and actions.
OMG. My party was the bomb. I have never had a party quite like that ever. I have had a few awesome Halloween parties, but never an awesome birthday party. My 15th we had fondue, but it was really nothing, no dancing or anything. My 16th we had my party in a garage. And it's always been really cold. But anyways this party was so freaking awesome. Everybody really enjoyed themselves and we just totally rocked. There was the movie, h'ors de orvres, a little tapenade with crackers, and shrimp sushi rolls, which Jessica managed to down 3 of them. Then there was the cheese that took forever to boil, and Mary being afraid of the chicken flesh, and the grape juice toast, and Karyn staring at the Disaronno Amaretto, and the cooking, and all of the chocolate in it's most luxurious power...Spilling on Katie. Then there was Cranium, the order of these things is not correct. Then the rave, the rave hmmm.... what can we say. Loud blaring music, fog, lights, room spinning, people falling playing with Karyn's car, what a rush, then sitting on the back deck, so we didn't hyperventilate then well it was before, Karyn drinking a mug of espresso. And the infamous "The 7 Hour Movie" lots of laughs. I really wish the people that were here tonight could have been in some of the scenes of the movie. Good times galore. On a scale of 1-10, last night was like a 15. It was so great. Actually the last past two weeks have been the best this year. Hopefully summer brings us more trips to Manhattan, the lake, and the mountains, or perhaps the beach. I miss the Florida Keys...Esp. for some weird reason, I miss Lake Surprise, so mysterious, so beautiful, I love Key West. This day will go down in Ben history. Spontaneous Prose literally played out through us. Well maybe more on Karyn. So many good times.
OMG the house was moving and falling off the couch and lying on my car and eating fondue and being a hobo and having too much caffiene and have a little bit of wine and rave and strobe lights and seven hour movie and  *crash*  i love life.  i want to live a very long time and i want to be young  man...i'm so fucked up right now....  -zr/k
So here it goes, the party is coming, I hope everything turns out okay, and that everyone comes, I hope it isn't another lame party.
KARYN!!!  Go to the DUNGEON!!!  *hilarity ensues*  Oh my god, today was so fun.  So fucking fun.  So goddamn fucking fun.  I haven't laughed this hard in so long, it isn't funny.  Let it suffice to say that Ben and I had a great time.  No, not like that, you perverts.  Although, if someone else had said that, I would have thought the same thing.  But yeah, hilarious little cousin.  Great stuff.  Good times.  I'm just not coherent enough to really write much else, now.  I'll go.  I'll quit hogging flipper.  -zr/k
Yes. The lake was so good yesterday. Freaky ducks and more! Today we are going to Oak Hollwo Park, otherwise known as the Dam Park, because of the giant dam. Well I found out that I'm not supposed to be on this site at school so...later.
I've noticed that, even though I'm not the person who actually started this blog (although I have administrative powers...so I can wipe you ALL out...HAHAHAHA), I have quickly become a total posting whore.  See what I mean?  Hmmm...I should probably fill this with some random, off-the-top-of-my-head poetry.  But my brain is too shot to put anything coherent together.  Oh, wait, I never write anything coherent anyhow.  Silly me!    blargh   eat snails pissing curtains on potatoes green slime gleaning information on white couches in the bronx pissed off chihuahuas licking enormous elephant kneecaps and fucking pixies sticks of stones and letter boxes wooden benches desk flowers power intel inside pentium processors fuck the fucking fucker and his fucking shit uoy knaht   (pans pans pans)   That was refreshing.  I think I'll go shower and sleep now...or something.  Look forward to Karyn totally whoring the blog again tomorrow.  Also look forward to her whoring her LiveJournal.  Because that's what she does best.  Along with addressing herself in the third person.  -zr/k
I forgot to post this on here:   HAPPY FUCKING BIRTHDAY BEN.   I'm not kidding, I really will make that card.  Sometime.  Maybe I'll draw you another psychedelic mushroom.  Or maybe I'll commit a sin and remove that page from Flipper v2.0 and give that to you instead.  But anyway, have fun being seventeen.  Too bad you can't do anything special that year.  At 13, you're a teenager.  At 14, you get a work license.  At 15, you get your permit, at 16 you get your driver's license.  A
