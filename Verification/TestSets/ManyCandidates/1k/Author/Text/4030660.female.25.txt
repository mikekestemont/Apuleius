The Mysterious thing called "LOVE"....          If you find yourself in love with someone who does not love you,   be gentle with yourself.   There is nothing wrongwith you. Love just didn't choose to rest in the otherperson's heart.     If you find someone else in love with you and you don't love him/her, feel honored that love came and called at yourdoor, but gently refuse the gift you cannot return. Do nottake advantage, do not cause pain.   How you deal with love is how you deal with you, and all our hearts feel the same pains and joys, even if our livesand ways are different...   If you fall in love with another, and he/she falls inlove with you, and then love chooses to leave, do not try toreclaim it or to assess blame, let it go. There is a reasonand there is a meaning. You will know in time...   Remember that you don't choose love. Love chooses you. Allyou can really do is accept it for all its mystery when itcomes into your life. Feel the way it fills you tooverflowing, then reach out and give it away.Give it back to the person who brought it alive in you. Give it to others who deem it poor in spirit. Give it to theworld around you in anyway you can....   There is where many lovers go wrong. Having been so long without love, they understand love only as a need. They see their hearts as empty places that will be filled by love, and they begin to look at love as something that flows to them rather than from them-   The first blush of new love is filled to overflowing,but as their love cools, they revert to seeing their love as a need. They cease to be someone who generates love andinstead become someone who seeks love.They forget that the secret of love is that it is a gift, and that it can be made to grow only by giving it away.   Remember this, and keep it to your heart. Love has its owntime, its own seasons, and its own reason for coming and going. You cannot bribe it or coerce it, or reason it intosaying. You can only embrace it when it arrives and give it away when it comes to you.    But if it chooses to leavefrom your heart or from the heart of your lover, there is nothing you can do and there is nothing you should do.Love always has been and always will be a mystery.Be glad that it came to live for a moment in your life....        got this from a friend's friendster board message...amp! panay lab na ko a.. hahaha.. am scared... really scared. pramis... its not that i don't wanna accept it.. it's more of like.. i don't think im prepared to get hurt again...   stupid stupid me.. cno ba naman ang ayaw magmahal at mahalin ren diba? hindi na tao un...awwww.. its so obvious that errol (mahbaby sa ro.. actually.. its not like "kame" prang nasanay lang,,, kung yung iba jan TAE tawag sakin,, parang ganun ren ke errol... baby nga lang.. hahaha) is in love.. and im so happy for him... ako ren kaya?? hahaha..   wag muna...   sbi nman ni kinky.. baka daw maiwanan ako...e di ganto nalang..
