Oh joy.  It's raining again.  Funny... I don't remember moving to Seattle.  I halfway expect to see the squirrels and other critters lining up in twos around here.  At least there is some thunder with these latest rains.  Gotta follow the rules, ya know - hehehe  Speaking of rules, I wonder if the new receptionist would be interested in learning a few of them?

I just found out someone has actually read this thing!  I'm so excited!  I know it's not the most interesting thing in cyberspace, but it's mine and I am proud of it.    I know I could go out and stir up some readership if I wanted to, but I'm not nearly that motivated.  I'll let people discover this on their own.  If anyone does read this please leave me a comment.  User participation is encouraged!  Thanks for reading!  Kisses - Carrie
Oh...  One other thing...  She smells good too.  Between her and the thunderstorms moving in I'm having quite a frisky afternoon.  Kisses - Carrie
Okay - I am officially in lust with our new receptionist.  She is absolutely incredible.  It's probably a good thing I will only be working here a few more weeks.  I could get myself in trouble otherwise.  She is 24 and recently moved to town to be with her boyfriend (too bad).  She's tight and thin and has absolutely fantastic legs (and ass).  She has long, straight dark hair and brown eyes to go along with her perfect skin.  Nice full, pouty lips as well.  Very kissable.  She's wearing a light green sleeveless top and matching skirt that really shows off her body.  I'm not joking when I say she could easily be a model.  She's that perfect.  Now if I could just do something about the puddles im making...  Kisses - Carrie
