While Caribbean broadcasters shut down their Medium Wave (AM) radio transmitters one by one, reports of the death of AM in the United States, whose economy we ape, are greatly exaggerated... AM RADIO YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND TOMORROW   Every day, Americans spend more time with radio than TV or newspapers. Radio is everywhere. If you want to buy a car without a radio you’ll have to special-order it. Talk is radio’s most-listened-to, most Sales-opportune format. For 30 years in this industry, I’ve had lots of fun, worked real hard, and made a great living. But radio isn’t all I do. I’m also in retail, and am myself a radio advertiser. I’m a big, big fan.   Every industry is changing. Like airlines, banks, and the family farm, life is very different in radio today than it was “when we got into the business.” And we can already see that radio will change even more in the near future than it has in the recent past. It’s human nature to dread change, but I am very optimistic about radio’s future.   What won’t change is who’s winning. It’s been said that if the government confiscated all wealth and issued every American the same amount in new currency, the same people would end up rich and broke a year later. Radio’s winners will continue to be the stations that are most alert and resourceful, that have the most fun, in short, those that care. Places where employees high-five each other when something great comes out the speaker.   When Marty Riemenschneider invited me to speak at this convention, I asked him what I could say that would have the most value. He sent me some specific questions, and I’ll give you specific answers. But what kind of consultant would I be without explaining “the latest trends?” So first, The Big Picture…   Yesterday…   Music on FM was either Percy Faith or Buffalo Springfield, music on AM was everything in-between.   Double-digit shares were common. There were fewer radio stations, and fewer other competitors for Time-Spent-Listening, as the Internet and hundreds of TV channels have become today.   Other than Paul Harvey, most of what you heard originated locally. This was a very redundant industry. There were always a half-dozen young men sitting between two turntables, even in medium markets like Springfield, Massachusetts, where I grew up.  Still, it was a buyer’s market for help. Even with Viet Nam draining the demographic that produced most radio talent, there were more applicants than on-air jobs. Talent felt lucky to be working, and management often treated them accordingly.   Stations with the highest ratings usually got most of the radio ad dollars.   The Internet was “the future.”   Today…   Listeners think of FM as music radio, AM as non-music radio.   Super-successful stations have single-digit shares. The aggregate cume of many clusters is now greater than the declining circulation of the metropolitan newspaper, though print rates still dwarf radio’s.   As self-serving as the following observation sounds coming from a vendor who sells systems, this historic deregulation has endowed owners with more stations than they have the think-time to manage. And it’s typical for more attention and resources to be allocated to defending topped-out music FM shares than to growing AM shares that are sooooooooooooooo much more Sales-friendly.   Most of the programming on non-music AMs comes from another city, and lots of it has franchise value. But at any given moment, there are no human beings in AM control rooms, even in big markets. I knew that The Talk Radio Revolution was over when visiting a client station and seeing them learn that one of their AMs was off-the-air only when a concerned listener phoned the switchboard.   Recently, some AMs who talk-the-talk about being the market’s information button failed to walk-the-walk when weekend how-to shows went uninterrupted by live coverage of the John Kennedy missing plane story. Station-in-a-box just chugged on.   The dark side of an 11,000 Dow is that service has deteriorated in a seller’s market for help. As a consumer, you suffer this every day, when receptionists who ask you to hold disconnect you…or you stand at a retail counter waiting to be waited on while employees chat with each other. Radio’s version of this is the uninformed Talk host, or the local newscaster reading the newspaper on-air and telling you what happened yesterday. Want to stand out from the other stations? Act like Nordstrom! Over-deliver! Hire a great receptionist! After all, this person is responsible for 99% of your station’s off-air PR.   With so many mediocre career radio performers lowering the bar, some of the biggest on-air salaries now go to people who haven’t spent their lives on-air. Before becoming Minnesota Governor, Jesse Ventura parlayed his wrestling persona into a Minneapolis morning show; and WJR/Detroit’s Mitch Albom and WRKO/Boston’s Howie Carr established themselves in other local media before hosting their successful afternoon shows. Are there “real people” in your market who should be on your air?   Two consultant buzzwords you’ll be hearing a lot are “repurposing” and “convergence.”   Example of repurposing: That gardening show is only on your air 2 hours on Sunday morning. Why must that be the only time you make gardening information available? How about reiterating your expert’s shtick as a point-and-click menu of gardening topics on your station’s web site…sponsored by your local advertiser…and paid for by their national co-op or vendor bucks?  Examples of convergence: ABC’s NFL Monday Night Football Pre-Game Show from originated from Baltimore’s ESPNZone restaurant. In the process, several Disney-owned brands and assets cross-promoted each other. Dr. Laura plugs a c
