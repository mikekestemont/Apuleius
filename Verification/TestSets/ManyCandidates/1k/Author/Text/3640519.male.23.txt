I have lived for twenty years in a small town called Mussoorie. I was brought there when I was less than three years old. That was when my father got transferred to the college in Mussoorie.  Most people view Mussoorie as some sort of a tourist attraction --- a typical British Raj hill station with a Mall Road and all the paraphernalia that goes along with one, a few waterfalls where you can satisfy your inner child's ( dear females, no pun intended !) desire to splash in puddles, a couple of spots where young honeymooners can spend some quality time, some roadside eateries which consistently fail to satisfy your demanding palate and lot's of poor rickshawwallahs and coolies who are always looking to fleece unwary tourists.  Mussoorie is not only all this but much, much more. For twenty years in Mussoorie have made me what I am today and I am afraid to trade these years with anything else lest it tur things for the worse. This small town where it is possible for one person to know everyone else, where people are still intereseted in what the family four blocks (I  use the term figuratively here) away is doing, where in one evenings walk you can traverse the towns entire span has , I dare say, more to it than one finds in big cities like Delhi and its likes.  There are so many intangibles, a term people like to use much these days, which still keep me a Mussoorie-man at heart. Pahaadi, my friends call me. I don't blame them. The hills are in my blood now. I  will always be attracted to the hills. The unforgettable scene of the Doon valley at night ---a dark sea on which are scattered tiny resplendent glowing  forms ; the winter line where the sky meets the earth ; the picture of clouds filling up the Doon valley and overflowing into Mussoorie; the temperamental weather where it alternates between bright and sunny to dark and rainy every few minutes; such images and many more will keep me connected to the hills and its people for life.
These two words are like those tasty dollops of cream without which your breakfast would be as bland as boiled water. And why wouldn't it be so... Manmohan Singh, an economist to the core is at the top of the Food Chain of Indian politics. That too after a rather dramatic turn of events which shows that we Indians can never fail to amaze the world.  Take a look at the news channels. These two words rattle endlessly out of those talking heads 24 x 7. As if our lives depended on these. I wish it did so that we could expect some welcome changes in the quality of life here in India. And sometimes I breathe a sigh of relief that our lives are rather insulated from the antics of Indian politics. We are just like people at a variety show or an amusement park--- being taken for a ride and going back home pleased but with considerably lighter pockets. Is this mass unconsciousness that keeps India going --- people happy and politicians happy too ? Maybe...
Robert Frost rests peacefully in his grave after giving us so much to think about. And often when overcome with the troubles and burden of modern life we pause to ponder, almost stopping by the woods on a snowy evening. Those memorable lines give us comfort not forgetting to remind us that soon we must get on with life. I often remember them when I am alone. Maybe, the lines have been crafted only for such moments. The Road Not Taken is a recurring story in all our lives. Some of these stories grow large enough to influence our entire lives. Lots to ponder about....
We have had a glorious past, haven't we? That's what we have been brainwashed since childhood to believe. We never question the fact. And we have used  the statement freely in essays, debates, speeches, history exams and a lot of other situations since the day we were born. Patriotism is a matter of accident. Wasn't it mere chance that you were born in India and not in New Zealand or Pakistan? And what if you were born in those countries? You would say that your country had had a glorious past. But that is when we let sentiments cloud our rational mind.  If you stop to ponder and really look at our history with a critical view what do you see? Two hundred years of subjugation and oppression by the Brits. And even longer period under the Mughals and other muslim invaders. And before that India wasn't India so to speak. Hundreds of principalities fighting among themselves like cats.  And what developments took place in these one and a half thousand years. Nothing very relevant on the scientific front. Unusable knowledge hidden in tomes which today makes us take pride in saying that we had done it first. But what use is something which does not benefit society at all. Big thing we discovered ZERO. What good did it do to us(Indians , I mean) ?? There is an even bigger list of our so called achievements which have benefited others but not us. Why??Even today we have to look west for new technology. Isn't that shameful? Even modern political systems have had there beginnings elsewhere and not in India. Democracy  had to be imported. And even today some people are yet to come to terms with it. How else do you explain the mammoth following of ranis and rajahs of bygone eras, which lifts them upto pedestals of power in our country even today? Industrial revolution didn't begin in India. This was because of the lack of crucial discoveries which in turn was due to lack of any serioius effort in this direction. What we have been fed since childhood has pulled a curtain over our eyes.This false shroud makes us complacent. We should really attempt to get at a true picture of o
