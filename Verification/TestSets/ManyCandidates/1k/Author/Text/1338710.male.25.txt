HEY! in a few days I sould have my mp3 page up and finished. Right now the picture is 4 years out of date and the song on their, well, speaks for itself. BUT you will be able to download my music for free and check out new songs. For those that would like to work over the internet i am also setting up a password only Chat type site with live audio or you can post audio. It's probably stupid but I am becoming more of a geek anyways. I called my brother, the web pirate today, and he "said" adambrowder.com "should" be up in a couple of days. j/k keith nothing but love. THIS SITE WILL STILL BE MY HOMESITE. So its safe to bookmark it.  For all of my friends who interested in working with an amazing female pianist/vocalist let me know. I met her at a song writing competition. My jaw about hit the floor when I heard her voice. Think Sarah M but a lot cooler.I told her I would try and hook her up with some co-writes, so don't make me a look like a liar. I will give her your number or email.  Also I have been writing lots of Incubus/Coldplay stuff with John lately. If anyone has anything like that and would be interested in sharing the love, book me!
