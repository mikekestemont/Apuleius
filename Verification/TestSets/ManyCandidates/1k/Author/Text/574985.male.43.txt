Ray Majoran of  urlLink electricurrent  and  urlLink ChristSites.com  wants church webmasters to think more deeply about their online communications strategy. In a  urlLink call to action "field manual"  for online churches, Majoran lists seven questions to "challenge your thinking about how your church media can be effective in today's world." A more thorough version of this call to action is available  urlLink in PDF format . It's also a bit of a sales pitch for  urlLink electricurrent , but it serves as a good public service announcement to the online Christian community as well.  Having said that, however, I still think Majoran falls short in his assessment of developing excellence in church media. He doesn't go beyond the traditional thinking of many online Christian ministries. Majoran talks about developing excellence in web design and web communication, but this all still assumes that people will be  looking for  church websites. From an outreach perspective, this is the traditional, "build it and they will come" passive approach. I wish Majoran would read my two-year-old piece on  urlLink The Church-Internet (Dis)connection  for a different perspective -- the idea of going out into the world of cyberspace instead of expecting the world of cyberspace to come to us.

In his book  urlLink  Roaring Lambs  , Bob Briner wrote about the need for Christians to engage the culture rather than running away from it. Andy O'Meara, the creator of  urlLink G-Force , a popular visualization plug-in for audio, is one such roaring lamb. You probably haven't heard much about Andy, but he's been spreading salt and light in the DJ, music and entertainment business with his fantastic products. Now he makes G-Force and other products available via  urlLink SoundSpectrum .  Andy doesn't trumpet his Christian faith on the SoundSpectrum website, but he does have plenty of opportunities to share his beliefs with the many satisfied customers who cross his path. As he explains in  urlLink his bio page  on the SoundSpectrum site:  Many people ask me how I came up with the name "G-Force" for my visual plugin. I respond that I'm Christian, and that the "G" is for God. I believe in Jesus Christ as the Bible describes, and although some parts of the Bible are open to interpretation, the concepts and claims relating to the core of Christianity are made clear and are not open for interpretation (ex, believing in Christ is not optional). But don't take my word for it -- form your opinion of Christianity from the story of Christ, not from hear-say or headlines. If you wanted a thorough understanding of a movie, you wouldn't consult critics or friends -- you'd go see the movie for yourself. I don't deny that many that have claimed to be Christian have done terrible things, but I offer that their Christianity stopped at their claims. Just because I claim that I'm a girl scout and that I like to bite the heads off chickens doesn't mean that I *am* a girl scout, nor does it mean that *real* girl scouts endorse chicken-head-biting. It's just that headlines like, "Girl Scouts Endorse Poultry Cruelty" sell well on newsstands. A person that claims to be Christian, wears a crucifix, or attends church doesn't mean that person is on a walk with God at all, so beware of who you're letting speak on the behalf of Christianity.  urlLink Who is Jesus Christ  is [a] site that describes the nuts and bolts of Christianity, presenting the story of Christ as well as answers to tough questions. It's maintained by an international and non-denominational Christian organization called Campus Crusade for Christ and has student chapters at most colleges and universities.  So there you have Andy O'Meara's approach to e-vangelism. It's nothing overt or heavy-handed -- in fact, it isn't too easy to find Andy's bio from the recently revamped SoundSpectrum site. But it's a concise, honest approach to sharing the faith with hundreds of G-Force and Whitecap fans. And O'Meara, by developing a product worth using and talking about, probably has more credibility to share his faith among visualization plug-in fans than many online "ministers."  G-Force began as freeware, and is still offered for free to the online world, but an upgrade to G-Force Gold is available for only $10. I'm a big fan of G-Force. I use an old version as a visualization tool for an old version of  urlLink Winamp  (note to self: upgrade both), and I've been very happy with the software's performance. The software works with other media players as well, and even some big-time musicians -- like Michael W. Smith -- have used the plug-in (see the  urlLink Summer 2004  entry at MusicSpectrum's news page).  So, if you'd like to support a "roaring lamb" who is quietly yet effectively being a witness in cyberspace, give Andy O'Meara's products a try.
Update: I've removed the RSS feed link until I can get the thing to work.  I think my RSS feed is dying of malnutrition. None of the items posted on this blog are getting to the RSS feed, for some reason. I've contacted Blogger support for some help but haven't heard back yet. So I'm appealing to the blogosphere. Will somebody please help me? How can I feed my RSS feed? Leave a comment here, or email me at andrewcareaga AT mailblocks DOT com.
Kill the fatted calf, somebody! Wayward blogger  urlLink Todd Hunter , voted by someone as  urlLink the worst blogger of 2003  for his lack of blogging consistency, has found his way home. But he's had a busy year on several fronts and should get an excused absence from the blogosphere. Todd now leads  urlLink Alpha USA  and articulates some great ideas about making the Christian faith relevant to the world. I met Todd Hunter at  urlLink Search Party 2002 , during which time he shared some great stuff. I hope he'll continue to share his thoughts on his new weblog.  And for those interested about his plans f
