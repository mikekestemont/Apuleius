Hello, this is fifo again, bored as hell, and falling assling here. Don't be expecting daily updates, only 2 times per week maybe, i don't know. I want to see 3 movies, the spiderman one, they say its really good, and dodgeball and whitechiks, but i don't know if i'll be able to go this weekened, and darn Yvette canceled our plans once more, and i sure dont feel like going to the movies with the guys, hell no. But oh well, blah to that. For the meanwhile, i'll clean my house on friday night, and watch movies in my dad's room, and saturday, just knock myself out of boredom.  Damn it, i've been gaining alot of weight, i don't know why, but all of the sudden, i've been getting really hungry and i have stop going to the gym, but starting next week, i'll be back on track hopefully. Chemistry has become easy, naming elements and chemical equations which i am very proficient at. But then again, they get harder and harder to crack, but i like it! its fun to work with those things hehe. Just 13 more days of school left and i am gettin the hell out, thank you lord. In prospects of continueing education, i think next week i MIGHT sign up for a course at UTB, hopefully they still have that SAT class, i really need to take it. Anyhow, i am really bored out of my mind, and have nothing to say, so might as well just leave. Good bye.
I just don't see how faith (which i believe is a good thing) can even be associated with organized religion, much less what drives it. organized religion seems to stand against everything that individual faith achieves: a better understanding of one's self, an increased objectivity because it is an individual thing, and really just a development of the human intellect. it takes work to try and understand how faith works, and the human mind tries to rationalize faith in higher power(s). it's interesting how faith is supposedly hand in hand with organized religion, when (from my observation) it seems to try and destroy the individual effort to attain faith.   my view of organized religion has continue to sour over the priest scandals, the fundamentalism that is causing so much death in the world right now. Well my friend and i discussed this a lot because she went to catholic school up through 10th grade, and has kind of a "falling out" with religion itself since coming to sja (which is, ironically, a catholic school). i just don't get it. i watch the news, and i see religious fundamentalists telling me that when they behead an innocent hostage that they're doing the work of God? bullshit. Then again, they deserve if for stepping foot in the wrong place. I am a spiritual person, but i can't understand why any rational person can possibly have a faith in a single church. don't they understand that their faith is misplaced? when the KKK said that lynchings were all part of "God's plan," that was bullshit, wasn't it? When i'm told that gays should be discriminated against through a federal marriage amendment because "God doesn't like them," i call bullshit on that one. i mean, if i had a girlfriend right now i'd be free to marry her now simply because i turned out to be heterosexual. what makes homosexuals so different that makes them somehow "inferior" to the point that they shouldn't be able to enjoy the rights that i enjoy now? answer? nothing. it seems that organized religion is only able to fuck up peoples' perceptions on what faith should truly be. i believe it should be an individual belief that one continues to debate and challenge in order to remain objective in light of anything new that comes up. i don't need a church to tell me what my faith should be. i can do that on my own,(Irronically i am Catholic)  and i think that only makes my faith stronger. wow, kind of a long entry, but it felt good to write down anyway...  I had a debate conversation with a couple of atheists (that includes sylvia) and then with a couple of christian extremeist, thus the entry.
Hello, well i figured since my xanga was getting old, and its open to the public (all my friends) i decided to make this one secret, perhaps i write better here. But then again, i know i'll be sharing this one with someone else, all for the good fun. I still need to learn how to control this site, so i'll take off now, and explore, goodbye.

some song lyric goodness:parody of an angel,miles above the sea,I hear the voice of reason,screaming out to me!Thrice - "The Melting Point of Wax"     Good afternoon, sorry for the delay of long inactivity in this dear bloggy of mine. I've been quite occupied lately with work since i am hired by my parents and threatened not to get paid if I show low signs of "working" mood albeit with long degrees of rest.&nbsp; So what have i been upto lately? Not much in particular, like i said, work. Oh, and verging into politics and speechles. I think i will join hugo and his political party for this program "kids vote usa"? I don't have much background on it, but we plan on making some type of pep rally at the mall (a political pep rally) and except a poplulation of 23000 teens. (right). So this friday we will be meeting up to see what's up? and yeah, that's ok. I might be going to matamoros because daddy and mommy has doctor appointments, and most likely we'll end up having a great nice dinner, yep.&nbsp;I guess this is all i have for today, not much of an update, but its something, so peace out.
Finally, Amen, school is over.  But sadly, i think i'll miss it, i met s
