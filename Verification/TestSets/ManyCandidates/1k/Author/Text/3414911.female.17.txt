i will give this one more week and then if no more people come, im closing it.
is this how we lose contact with other ibers of 2004 and never to see them again?  (god I wish so)
Maybe Mr. Ritscher is just a sad little man with no ideas of his own, who is doomed to pursue Mr. Dowd's shadow in hopes of being "cool": cool enough to have an opinion on every little thing and think we all love him for it.
it looks like you missed commenting on some of the blogs, Mr. Dowd. and i was getting so interested in yuriko.   now this is finally getting interesting. thanks for the anecdotes from your childhood...i always wanted to hear more about the childhood of the lovable coordinator we know. ritscher, please share some stories too... but andrew is right: you are beginning to fall into your habit of agreeing with mr dowd. geez, ritscher, when are you going to get ideas of your own?
FUCK YOU MR> DOWD AND MR> RITSCHER WHETHER BE YOU FAKE ASSES OR THE GENUINE AND ALL THE FUCKING IB KIDS  I HATES YOU SO MUCH I"VE HATED YOU EVER SINCE THE DAY I WAS BORN I KNEW IN MY BLACK HEART THAT YOU ARE ALL FUCKING SOBS YOU ALL SHOULD ROT IN HELL>  ESPECIALLY YOU MR> DOWD>  OH AND BY THE WAY TAPESTRY MY BLACK ASS!!!!!!~~@

the one place you really don't want a tick How does one get a tick on their testicles? I have no idea, but it happened to me when I was about twelve years-old. No, I wasn't doing naked push-ups in a field of unmowed grass. And no, I wasn't attempting to impregnate a rabbit. I had actually returned from the public swimming pool and was removing my bathing suit when I noticed a black thing down there. I thought it was debris of some sort and attempted to brush it away. It didn't budge. Upon closer inspection, it was obvious that I had become host to tick. He was already swollen and apparently feeding away. What was he after? Sperm? What could he hope to accomplish down there? Who cares. I wanted the thing off me. I had known enough though to not just rip it out. I did what any confused kid does, I asked my mom. I don't recall how I told her, but I'm sure it went something like this - "Mom, I have a tick on my balls." In any case, she checked it out (insert joke here), and was all panicked since it was already embedded and stuff. She was concerned that improper removal could result in sterility or something dramatic like that.  Next thing you know I'm in the car with my dad on the way to the emergency room. Awesome. After all of these years I can't remember how long I had to sit in the emergency room with a tick on my testicles, but I don't think I was there too long. If this were an episode of ER, it would have gone like this:  Dad: Excuse me nurse, we have a situation here.  Nurse: What's going on?  Dad: My son has a tick on his testicles.  Nurse: Oh my god!  [loudspeaker: paging Dr. Gringus... Dr. Gringus, report to ER immediately]  Nurse: Let me have a look. [jumps back in horror]  Dr. Gringus: Jesus Nancy, get me vaseline and tweezers... stat!  Nurse: Ok, you're going to feel a pinch.  [I pass out...]  Alright, so I know it didn't happen like that. I do remember laying on my back though with my pants down as several medical people hovered over my genital area. It was great. They got the thing out somehow and I was quickly released with a smile. I'm sure I went home and played with LEGOs afterwards or something stupid like that.
tyler... you're an idiot
I'm Roger Dowd, and I will be checking this blog regularly for any published perversity towards the IB program, Thornton High, or me. If I happen upon any of this nonsense I will make sure that every last one of you receive a 2 on your history exams if you catch my drift, understood?
i found something interesting to post. maybe some of you have seen this, and i know for a fact that some of you have (and didn't think it was amusing. what's wrong with you?), but it's worth posting again and again.  http://www.houstonjusticenotwar.org/articles/terrorist_attack/  'no one wants to see that shit.' haha. you'll know when you see it.
so, what   is   supposed to be going on here, other than hellos? what do we have to say that's interesting, really? anyhow, a fish in a bowl has slightly more freedom because it can move in 3 dimensions in the water. the hamster can only run on the bottom and climb halfway up the side. but then...who likes movement anyway? movement is for the active. i'm tired.
would you rather be a fish in a bowl or a hampster in a cage?
yeah, so i'm with tyler on this one, the livejournal has got all of my attention. not much going on in here anyways, just a bunch of hi's and hello's. i guess i may as well write... erm, type something interesting that people might actually want to read. wait, i don't ever have anything interesting to say. nevermind.
Hi everyone. Glad to hear that you're all... um... alive? Anyway, I'll see you all on Tuesday anyway so I wasn't too worried :)
So I created an LJ community for our class, called THSIB04 (www.livejournal.com/~thsIB04), but I figure we can use both of these groups - if people want to create a LiveJournal (an online diary that many of us are already using) they can go to livejournal.com and create one, and join our group.  If not, we can keep using this too.  Just thought I'd create more options. By the way, breakfast at Karen's in the Country tomorrow at 9:30 - if you're interested, call Ashley Saxon.
