[via  urlLink Singularity Now journal ]  "Cyberkinetics Inc. of Foxboro, Mass., has received Food and Drug Administration approval to begin a clinical trial in which four-square-millimeter chips will be placed beneath the skulls of paralyzed patients.  If successful, the chips could allow patients to command a computer to act â€” merely by thinking about the instructions they wish to send.  It's a small, early step in a mission to improve the quality of life for victims of strokes and debilitating diseases like cerebral palsy or Lou Gehrig's. Many victims of such ailments can now survive for long periods thanks to life support, but their quality of life is poor."   At last!  Now all we need is decent speech-recognition software...
[via  urlLink Nanobot  via  urlLink boingboing ]   "The genius of nanotechnology is the reduction of space. Smaller is infinitely more powerful. Consider the first transatlantic telephone cable. This bulky line carried approximately 32 phone calls. You might assume that to add more callers, one must simply enlarge the cable. That was the old way of thinking. Today, scientists recognize that less matter and less space, not more, equals more raw power. A micro-thin fiber optic cable can now carry 320,000 phone calls on a simple thread of light.  It seems that scientists on the cutting edge of nanotechnology are reaching the same conclusions about space as did the kabbalists thousands of years ago." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Rabbi Berg   While Yehuda Berg is perhaps not the most sanctified individual to discuss these issues, having turned the Jewish mystic tradition toward  urlLink profit  and  urlLink Hollywood , his analysis of the situation is astute.  The Kabbalistic doctrine of  urlLink  tzimtzum  , advanced by Rabbi Isaac Luria in the 1600s, holds that the creation of the universe by God was not an eminent creative act but instead resulted from contraction.  That is, instead of a positive creation of the universe from nothing out of God's form, there was a self-gathering or pulling-in of God (who  is  the entire univers) to leave room for existence as we know it to take place in the void left-over from that contraction.  In the same way, Berg's comments recall that principle in modern communication networks: signal processing is used to pack an increasing number of messages into a static-sized physical channel.  In the internet this is done by what is called a Multiple Access protocol;  whether through partitioning a channel by time-, frequency- or code-division, random-access, or taking turns.  Berg takes this further by implying that through nanotechnology we are doing the same thing with the physical world itself.   Now, not only are we packing more information into static physical channels, we are also packing more physical complexity in to static-sized containers by decreasing the contents' spatial requirements.
urlLink Cosmos 'a billion years older'   Measurements made in an underground laboratory suggest an atomic reaction that produces energy inside stars is slower than was believed.  It means that estimates of stellar lifetimes are too short. A readjustment gives the Universe an age of 14.7 instead of 13.7 billion years.   urlLink Chandra opens new line of investigation on dark energy   Astronomers have detected and probed dark energy by applying a powerful, new method that uses images of galaxy clusters made by NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory. The results trace the transition of the expansion of the Universe from a decelerating to an accelerating phase several billion years ago, and give intriguing clues about the nature of dark energy and the fate of the Universe.  Don't you hate it when all your cosmological theories turn out to be just that?  Here's to another billion years of not knowing what the universe really is!
Claire Whelan, a computer science grad at Dublin CIty University in Ireland,  urlLink has managed to decrypt blacked out words  in declassified documents, using " little more than an electronic dictionary and text-analysis software ."  She should be talking to  urlLink The Memory Hole  soon I hope.   [ via  urlLink Metafilter  ]
I rededicate you, forgotten blog, by the themes of miscommunication, novelty, alternative interpretations, and a healthy mistrust and lust of technology.  Wake up.  I am another inferior imitator in this game.  This will be a slow awakening, like being interrupted from a dream but still locked in sleep paralysis.
by  urlLink Dr Vladimir Dimitrov , cybernetician of engineering and mathematics.    "In human systems, emergence implies serendipity and creativity both at individual (intrapersonal) and group (interpersonal) levels of interaction. For creativity to take hold and flourish, emergence needs space and freedom. Emergence cannot be designed. Emergence cannot be imposed. It simply happens - as a spontaneous burst of energy accumulated through the complex interplay of interactions. At an individual level this is the enigmatic and often paradoxical interplay between physical, emotional, intellectual and spiritual fractals of human personality. At a group level, this is the autopoiesis of communications - people in dialogue with people, people in communication with their environment, people in communion with the spiritual essence of the universe...  Emergence can breathe order out of chaos, simplicity out of complexity, serenity out of confusion, inspiration out of every day monotony, insight out of mere intellectual speculations. While we cannot design a specific emergence, we are not merely helpless witnesses. We can create conditions for it to happen, we can read its presages and empower its heralds. We can seed it and make it blossom for the Good of Life on our planet."  Dimitrov recently published a book, titled  urlLink A New Kind of Social Science: Study of Self-organization of Human Dynamics .  If this book is anything like this older article of his, it could be quite interesting.

"There is a repeating pattern to all of Creation. Quantum physics has proven this over and over in the organization of matter. There is a pattern of intentions and events, as well. We - or rather Consciousness - have been down this same road s
