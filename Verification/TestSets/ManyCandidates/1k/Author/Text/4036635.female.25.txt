&nbsp; Barack Obama's speech the other night really made me proud to hail from the state of Illinois, even if it has only been for the last two years.&nbsp; The whole Democratic National Convention really pumped me up...it's weird, it's like the Olympics only within our country, each state proud to represent and give up their nominations for Kerry/Edwards.&nbsp; With such enthusiasm and energy, the city of Boston was alive with "Hope (is) on the way!"&nbsp; Although, I must say, that's a bit too cheesy a tagline for my liking.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Aside from the obvious enjoyment and pride of Kerry and Obama's speeches, I also enjoyed Jennifer Granholm's presentation--she's from the OTHER state that I hail from, Michigan.&nbsp; The thing that all of these speeches had that I appreciated and was drawn to was  passion .&nbsp; For the first time in a long time, I remembered what it was like to hear a powerful presidential speech.&nbsp; We all know that Bush's address' leave a lot to be desired, and these DNC speeches really put him to shame!&nbsp; I miss those moving address'!&nbsp; You know, when 9/11 happened, I remembered walking away from Bush's address thinking "that's it? that's all you're going to say? I don't feel moved from your words, I don't feel anything."&nbsp; After watching the DNC, I realized that I wanted not just a better president, but one who could deliver a passionate, motivating speech that I couldn't see right through.&nbsp; I want Kerry, even if I don't agree with everything he does, I don't think I'll ever find a president that will meet all of my standards--he comes pretty close and ANYBODY but Bush.  &nbsp; Anyway, one of my most favorite parts was when they went through each state individually, including Guam and Smaoa (who knew? Not me!), for their delegates' nominations for the democratic presidential candidate.&nbsp; When they got to Florida, "Madam Secretary" says "Florida.&nbsp; You are given 201 votes, which we will be sure to count  each and every vote,  throughly! How do you cast your votes?"&nbsp; The rep from Florida says "Madam Secretary, in 2000 we had elected a president, and his name was Al Gore...we have been living under the labor of two Bushes for too long...you may count all 201 votes for John Kerry..."&nbsp; Oh, I laughed out loud!&nbsp; I am so glad that they made note of that...made Michael Moore proud, no doubt.&nbsp; So, to the republican parties, I say "Ha, shove it!"   &nbsp; Well, this weekend I will be back in Michigan, primarily for one of my good friend's bridal shower.&nbsp; I'm thinking it will be better than most bridal showers because a lot of good people are going to be there and it's at an upscale bar.&nbsp; We shall see...   &nbsp;Other than that, not much else going on here... you know the drill...   &nbsp;
Okay, today was definitely filled with choices, moreso than any other day I have had since school (aka my teaching job) let out for the summer.&nbsp;    &nbsp; This morning I awoke to the sound of a very nice man offering me a chance to interview for a new position for the fall.&nbsp; I called him back once I had shed my morning voice (you always want to portray that you were up before 11am!) and scheduled an interview for 10 am tomorrow.&nbsp; The only concern was that I was already scheduled to go sit at a 2-3 day conference and get paid for it, but because it was an opportunity to find a better school, I took the interview.&nbsp; I called my mentor teacher/friend to see if she knew anything about the school, and to tell her my choice of going to the interview instead of the conference.&nbsp; Her advice was to check the school stats on the school website.&nbsp;    &nbsp; Pros: school is 5 miles closer to home.    &nbsp; Cons:&nbsp; Same type of community, same test scores/overall achievement&nbsp;(low: only 25% of students are at or above the national norms in reading or math--which leaves the inverse of 75% students who can't read anywhere close to where they should be).&nbsp; Today's conclusion: school I accepted interview with is a lateral move, a mere trade off of the school I am currently at.    &nbsp; So, I could go to the interview for&nbsp; a job that appears to be no better than the job I am already at or go sit and be numb at a conference and get paid to do so.&nbsp;    &nbsp; I just called the school and cancelled my interview.&nbsp;If you are not a teacher, you should know that there isn't a general website you can go to&nbsp;in order to post your resume and have&nbsp;people just contact you for&nbsp;a job--you have to contact the schools individually.&nbsp; It's a totally different world from the business realm.&nbsp; &nbsp;I feel a little guilty for passing up an opportunity like that, but I did learn something new today about my job search--I now have&nbsp;a place that I can compare my school options with,&nbsp; not just which schools have openings.&nbsp; Yea for small knowledge gains, now I will be more prepared if opportunities present themselves.     &nbsp;   &nbsp;  A personal choice I had to make today was whether or not to talk to this guy I met who had responded to my Craigslist post on Saturday (that was about being bored in the city; which coincidentially led to my starting this blog; who knew posting could feel so good?)&nbsp; He seems like a really nice guy and we've been emailing for a couple of days now.&nbsp; It started just talking about the different things to do in Chicago, then it evolved into maybe we could do some of these new things together sometime.&nbsp; He sent me a picture and he seems/looks normal and nice.&nbsp; I hesitated on responding to his picture and his invite to actually take some of our brainstormed ideas and do them together, to which he noticed and apologized hoping that he hadn't freaked me out by making it more personally than the sharing of ideas.&nbsp; Eventually I t
