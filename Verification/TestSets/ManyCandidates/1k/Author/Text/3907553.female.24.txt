Even without Lifehouse Jason Wade writes great songs. Like this one from the shrek soundtrack.  You Belong To Me   See the pyramids along the Nile  Watch the sunrise from the tropic isle  Just remember darling all the while  You belong to me   See the market place in old Algiers  Send me photographs and souvenirs  Just remember when a dream appears  You belong to me   And I'll be so alone without you  Maybe you'll be lonesome, too   Fly the ocean in a silver plane  See the jungle when it's wet with rain  Just remember 'til you're home again  You belong to me   And I'll be so alone without you  Maybe you'll be lonesome, too   Fly the ocean in a silver plane  See the jungle when it's wet with rain  Just remember 'til you're home again  You belong to me    Its great...trust me. But not as Good as Everything by Lifehouse now thats a love song, maybe one day all good men will find someone whos their 'Everything'. Happy listening.
I'm bored so if you have an amusing rant/story then stick your comments here please!

Bilious says that finding someone to be with is not unlike archery...except its uphill, thers a strong cross wind and you drank 13 pints of gut ripper the night before. If you aim to low you'll never be happy with what you hit. But if you aim to high you'll never even hit the target. So get drunk be merry and I'll see you with a hangover in the morning
Well here it is at last, I've given up with social chameleon the website as dreamweaver was pissing me off! So for the moment I've gone with Social Chameleon the blog. Keep an eye out for pics, reviews, recipes and rants on this page. Have fun
My legs hurt..."why?" I here some of you cry. Wellactually none of you probably give a stuff but i'mgonna tell you anyway. Basically its because ofthis...I have been on a course for 3 weeks and itended yesterday at about 3pm \o/ so i went for a quietsocial drink with my fellow course mates :o) Aftersome lunch and a few pints me and some of others movedonto jugs of cocktails. It was about this point youngVictoria Salter arrived to join me in my Soiree and ibegan on the vodkas. Now I'm not exactly how many Ihad but after an hour or so went got the tube totemple as some of the peeps off my course where goingto a pub on a boat. I think it was called the queenmary, however due to the queue we couldn't be arsed sowent to motion for another vodka before going toocamden and munching through a kfc. Basically the restof the evening goes: meet tom in pub -> 1. aftershock-> 2. vodka -> repeat actions 1. and 2. several times-> go to underworld -> do point one again and repeatseveral times -> lose tom as he runs off with somebird that isn't his girlfriend -> leave with vic at2.30ish -> walk to trafalgar square (now anyone goodat geography knows there not exactly close) -> try andnot let vic stumble into road -> have mcdonalds to tryand sober up -> get night bus -> get home -> sleep. Now can anyone guess why my legs hurt? Well I ain'tgonna spell it out :op it was a fun night tho and thewalk was quite nice actually. I went to  urlLink www.rupissed.com  and it said this:&nbsp;281.87g alcohol ingested...201.37g still left in me and the comment was "You should be dead by now". In the words of Samuel Beckett "Oh boy".

You know women are a strange breed...in fact I'm pretty sure they're not actually the same species as men. But anyway enough of that, I was asked the question yesterday in an email, "do you fancy any one?" and the answer was no and honestly so. But today however the answer maybe somewhat different, maybe indeed. Now I'm pretty sure no one (except maybe John as he's a moderator) reads this blog so I'm quite safe in posting the fact that I may fancy someone from work. However, I will only say who if you email me :op  Have fun
