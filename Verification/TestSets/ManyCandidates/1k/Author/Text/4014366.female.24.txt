my last day of work today...  spent my entire workday crying and shitting (that's right!), because i was too sad and neurotic, my stomach was fucking up on me.  i have been crying like a bitch as soon as i walked into the company, and i would start crying over something utterly utterly stupid, for instance, today i brought sugar to the company for coffee, and this guy made a comment about me being so nice for buying sugar for everyone, just like that, i started crying hysterically! so u know how much i must've cried today! i really hate crying, it makes my big nose seem even bigger (and red, too!!!), but i just can't help it, my tears are always easily triggered.  as i was walking out, larry shouted from far behind: "stop crying!"...i just wish i could.  got to spend my entire week off remastering microsoft excel, i hate that shit, i hate anything that has to do with calculations and formulas. anywayz, if u need to hang out this week, do call me!! i need to shop for business outfits, too.  ready for a new life?
hey remember i told u about this hospital job i was interviewed for? well, i got it!!   u know i wasn't confident enough about getting the position because the entire interview process was much to complex and detail oriented..i wasn't sure if i was really on the "top of the list" as what the recruiter lady'd told me two days ago, until my general manager today got a call from the hr asking for my reference, then i knew they were really finalizing the candidates...i literally screamed when i got this call!   i told my general manager about this new job, his eyes became teary and said he never should have given that reference! as advised by everyone in my company, that i should only tell the boss on the day i leave, not prior to, because she is mad shady, who knows what kinda shit she's gonna pull&nbsp; when she finds out i am leaving. well, saying goodbye is tough, especially to those nice people who's been with u nine-to-five for 4 years. "no banquet lasts forever"   the only thingie that kinda bothers me is the travelling, it's crazy! :) but my meager little wish is just to work happily, that's all. i hope i can make it there.   BTW. WHO EVER READS THIS WILL NEED TO BUY ME DINNER AS CELEBRATION, YOU, YOU AND YOU, YOU KNOW WHO U ARE!
my gal becky is 6-week pregnant! so happy she's finally decided to keep the baby, and i am the registered god mother! although it is 10 months away, but still i'm very very excited because it's the closest experience i have for ever being a mom! everyday i can see her changes, such as increasingly compulsive eating behavior (we called it ICEB, heheh), dramatic mood change over some chicken shits, all that exhausion and sickness...it must be tough. being chinese, i know the extreme importance about the month prior/post to the delivery, but it is hard for an american to&nbsp; understand it.   today's pauline's last day of work, very happy for her to get out of this hellish place. she is opening up a restaurant in whitestone some day next&nbsp;month,&nbsp;she said if i ever visit that place, she will give me free drinks and 50% on everything else, lovely!&nbsp;   just finished watching&nbsp;an old school kung-fu movie for i guess the 10th time, strange as i am, i feel safe&nbsp;and protected by&nbsp;repeatedly watching movies that i am&nbsp;familiar with.&nbsp;in my house i have countless collections of kung fu related movies and tv shows, it would surely be hard to save myself from my own torment if living without these old movies.   i feel i am turning this board into an old lady blah blah place, totally aimless. check out keith's blogboard, his funny, prolific messages are my inspiration for writing my own bullshit :) it's good to spit it sometimes, my old shrink from teenage years used to say so.
it's monday!!!  the recruiter lady at the hospital (the one i'd been interviewed for) asked me to fax her a copy of my recommendation letter. the gm at my company is mad cool with me, so he wrote it exactly as how i'd wanted it to be, self motivated, highly organized, pleasant to work with, no excessive absences (which is totally bs,&nbsp; just think about how many fridays i've left work early because of the so called "women's monthly cramp", which all coincidently happened on nearly every friday, heheh.) however, after i faxed, i called the recruiter lady to confirm receipt,&nbsp;she confimed it, and conveniently told me that i was "on very top of their list"..yeah yeah yeah, like it means shit.  imagine i can't find a job and gonna get stuck here for another 4 freakin' years? then please drive a car and run me over.
urlLink     ray is taking some girls to a scenic spot, so he came to me for suggestions. pete and i are nature loving people, the first places on my list were: sand's point somewhere in long island, oakland lake in bayside and oyster bay.   apparantly one of&nbsp;my girlfriends anita did not enjoy sand's point at all, she is&nbsp;such a metroplitan girl who sees&nbsp;no&nbsp;beauty in "unpolished beauty" hehehe.. hey when it comes to natural scenic places, i can probably name a whole bunch, but no matter what, central park is definitely out of my list, it's all man-made, deliberately reconstructed for human convenience and interests. what a turn-off.   &nbsp;
lovely day today,  the cool breeze sweeps away all undesirable stress that a regular sunday would bring, it is good to feel emotionless sometimes, don't you think?   called dad today, as usual we spoke about chinese calligraphy, world politics and how a decent human being should act when facing various situations...urged him to see a doctor if he felt anything wrong, of course, i
