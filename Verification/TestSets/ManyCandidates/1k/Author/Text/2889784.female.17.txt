Well i think the answer to the long going caveman astronaut fued is quite obvious... Millions of years ago, explorers from another planet landed on earth.  There mission was to search the new found biosphere for signs of rocks.  To their bewilderment, the earth was covered in rocks, and actually, was a rock itself.  The explorers, urinating themselves in glee, bathed themselves in rocks, and forgot about all those who they left home.  Pretty soon, they started to reproduce and created a colony called, Chumbawumba-Monkey-Bang.  Out of the fine rock samples they had found, they were able to create moder devices, like the wheel, a microwave, and a pop tart.  But along with these marvles came advanced weaponry, such as clubs and sticks and spears, and smaller rocks you could throw. Sooooooooo, in concern, the previous planet they lived on sent Astronauts, to make sure everything was going alright.  Upon arrival however, they were pelted with rocks and told to go "shove a rock up their asses".  WEll now, the astronauts were quite bedazzled and didnt know what to think.  But in the code of the anstronuat they had no choice but to use lazers.  The war between astronauts and cave people lasted like... i dunno... a few months and stuff.  But anyways the cave people built this huge boulder and the astronauts built a huge lazer, and the dinosaurs didnt really know what to do, so they kinda ran away.  But simultaneously, the magnificent boulder and big lazer collided... and everything blew up... like majorly blew up... Like the Death Star blowing up in Star wars.... the remaster version... anyways, all the cave people and astronauts were destroied, and the dinosaurs were extinct too.  But luckly, before the cavemen died, they were able to create creatures out of rocks, which were smart and could talk more then the cavemen.  These creatures were hidden underground during the great war, and finally after the rock dust and lazer plasma cleared, they came out and started a new colony, America... which they named after the really cool alien pop star... who wass really cool... so you see, in the war between the two forces of astronauts and cavemen... they both kill eachother because they are equally as cool.

i have the ultimate solution. start telling one of them you have to do the other thing and the second they start giving you an attitude, cry! seriously, teachers cannot handle crying. yeah, i know you're a guy and crying isn't exactly kosher for the male population, especially when surrounded by other macho men, but it totally works when ur in trouble with someone. BELIEVE ME! I know from experience!!! but if this tactic fails you or you just refuse to use it, i think you would have to stick with your band practice, unless, like kat said, you could manipulate your schedule so that you can do both (maybe tell the drama director that you have to go to the bathroom and when returning half an hour later, let him know about your problem with constipation). hahaha... well... good luck! i know juggling things can be ridiculously hard.  hahaha.. good point about the cavemen kat!   i am glad to see that all 2 of you are using this thing!  go and pester others to do the same... or not... but when the blogger kingdom collapses do not blame me! lol....
If cavemen and astronauts got into a fight, who would win?   Do the astronauts have weapons? No
I think I've had to deal with this once or twice b4. Now unless ur a major part, I'm pretty sure that you won't be practicing the whole time: So that leaves you to go to band practice. If ur teacher isn't a nazi, I'm also pretty sure that they'll let you leave early.   But I dunno. Talk to your teachers to see if you can leave early or be late or whatever.
DUDES! monday i have to choose between play practice or band practice... if i miss play, i loose my part, but if i miss band, i fail... YAR! both of the teachers that lead these are equally insane and unreasonable... does anyone know how to deal with crazy teachers??  i think im gona hire a gang of ninjas to attack their vechicles and pop all there tires so i dont have to deal with either of them BRAJKL::::L:Fjdl;afl;jda
