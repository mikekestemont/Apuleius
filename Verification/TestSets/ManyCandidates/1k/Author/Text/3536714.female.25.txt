So we put a man on the moon. So we landed a little remote controlled explorer thingy on Mars. So we have invented crazy-ass computer chips that can perform endless tasks at mind-blowing speeds. It slices, dices, copies, collates, now money down, no down payment, do not pay until 2002, sell your soul and go shopping. Ok, all these technological advances are really great and all, and the further we explore the dark reaches of space, the further we get from the real final frontier. Think about it, if thereís one thing that we should be exploring and learning about its our very own minds.   Ladies and Gentlemen, boys and girls, the brain is the most amazing thing. Like we may find Martians some day, but you know whatís gonna happen? They're just gonna laugh at us and our puny little underdeveloped minds, then theyíll probably kill us and use our bodies for surfboards. Ok, that may not happen, but the sad fact of the matter is that we as a race only use an estimated 10% of our brains capacity. It is said that if we pushed it up to 20% we could hold 4 or 5 law degrees and memorize the Tokyo phone book. Now thatís using your melon. Just imagine what human kind could achieve mentally if we exploited 50% of our mental capacity. Wow, we could probably communicate telepathically, and cheat on tests and bend spoons and spontaneously ignite people we donít really like on fire.   We as humans have been barking up the wrong tree for quite some time now. Some think that the industrial revolution was actually a big step backward for it encouraged machinery and hence laziness. Sure we can nuke TV dinners and enjoy high speed cable Internet connections but we failed to develop the greatest computer of all; our minds. Speaking from an evolutionary point of view, we can see that with time our foreheads stopped sloping; due to the recession of clubbing wars...   [TANGENT!] Don't you think that clubbing theses days, as in getting squirly drunk and trying to score equates with the old OOGA BOOGA days when clubbing actually meant knocking a woman out and dragging her home by her hair... I mean alcohol is the modern day club... see both give you a headache the next morning, but at least weíve evolved enough to take a cab home seeing as itís not easy dragging drunken women around by their hair...not that Iíve tried it...lately. SO where was I? Oh yeah, sloping foreheads and enlarged canine teeth, have been left behind since we stopped eating raw yak meat. If these types of trends continue, our fingers will develop nicely since we use them more and more, and other such faculties like our toes, our hair and our BRAIN will fall by the wayside. But thatís ok right? Cause the sun still shines, the WWF is still on every week and there an American flag somewhere on the moon.   So what can we do about it? Nothing. Well, at least not in our lifetimes. There still isnít a sure fire way to increase brain capacity. Now it is true that people drill holes into their heads to create more blood and oxygen flow hence supposedly increasing their brain capacity, but yeah..drilling holes? Not for me..not now. Perhaps next Friday but not now. So the best that Fadniz can suggest is to read, to learn, to stay away from all forms of professional wrestling, no matter what The Rock says, pay attention in school, try to see things from different perspectives (this doesnít mean standing on your head and staring out the window), and try to learn from all experiences no matter how useless they may seem.

Two-headed monsters arguing over cooperation. Egomaniac overweight pigs karate chopping spineless frogs in trench coats. Over-sensitive red furry spazzoids who always want to be hugged and played with. Sound like a bad acid trip? Well it isn't. It's the insanity that you watched everyday as a child. It came from the mind of a true revolutionary. The man and his Muppets. It's Sesame Street.    It's pretty obvious that Sesame Street taught youth the fundamentals or reading, writing and arithmetic, but it also gave us a direct insight into the complex minds of Muppetkind. WHICH, coincidentally are strikingly similar to our own intricate minds. I'm not saying that there's a little muppet in all of us....wait a minute... yes I am. Especially in the area of so called mental illnesses. What the hell are you talking about Fadniz?!! Just shut up and listen. Shh!   Hey, where did bag of Oreos go? Who keeps beating up the Girl Guides? Follow the chocolate chip trail... COOOOKIE!!!! C is for compulsive overeater. Now Cookie Monster had some serious issues. His 'love' cookies seems to be the bi-product of frustration. I mean muppets deal with trauma in different ways. Cookie is obviously upset that he has a minuscule vocabulary and is limited to such utterings as: "Coooookie, ME WANT COOOOKIE, and AARggummmuugh." Also it doesn't help that he also exhibits telltale signs of Attention Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). To compensate for his illnesses Cookie developed an compulsive eating Dissorder, thus making him the scorn of cookie consumers everywhere. I say this because we never actually saw Cookie purchase cookies. Even though Hooper's store was right there the whole time. He never bought a single bag. Rumour has it that Cookie's rogue cookie theft led the eventual divorce of Ernie and Bert.   You frog-abusing loud-mouthed porker! Moi? You over-aggressive egomaniac snob! Moi? Yes YOU! I don't know about the rest of you, but I always hated that fat 'bringing-home-the-bacon' witch. I mean leave that poor frog alone. Don't you know that it's hard enough being green? She though of her self as a star yes she always sang off key and she didn't really look that great in an evening gown. I
