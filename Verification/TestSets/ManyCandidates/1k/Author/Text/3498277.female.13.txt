OK Aaron, the boy with condoms from the play that i mentioned earlier-- i thought he was gonna leave me alone now but today his friend spencer gave me this note--  Julia, As you know i like you and well... i was hoping maybe you had maybe got over your ex-boyfriend. And i know you cant just get over your ex but i just wanted to know.  because if you were i was hoping me and you could go do something together. and if you are ready maybe we could go out. So what do you think? -Aaron  so i didnt respond, right? but i showed the note to Dani and Christine and Madison. then during notes for ACT II,and spencer had seen me so he gave me this other note that aaron wrote to him b/c he thought it would make it better:  Spencer, i like julia but i dont know if she likes me. I know she said that she thought i was a great guy but she also said that she needed time to get over her ex boyfriend but i dont know when she will be over him. I know it takes time but it has been a month plus days. i want her so bad but i do not want to make a move until she is ready. so im hoping she will tell if she likes me. -Aaron  the getting over my ex boyfriend thing was, by the way, an excuse because i mean he is nice and he is kind of hot but HE CARRIES CONDOMS AROUND!!! HE'S AND EIGHTH GRADER!!!and also, he seemed like really over sensitive. so i figured he was either really sincere or really fake and oh such a jerk. jack saw that i had a note and he asked me about it (he's lookin out for me he's like a big brother)and i let him read both of them. after reading the first one he asked me if i responded and i said no and he said smart move. after he read the second one, he said   "No. no. see, i know aaron, and he only wants two things. he wants a relationship, and he wants sex. he's playing this game.this is the way it works at his school.the girls at his school...this works with them. see once he gets you..." "you need an eighth grade version of me. i know a couple of those...i think i was like that for a while, but i realized it wasnt working. its alot better this way" jack is a good guy. jack is my foster (couldnt figure out how to spell surregit) brother. and he needs to go ahead and call my sister!!! for those of you who read MY LEG IS ASLEEP (my sister's blog), jack is, infact, the "hot play guy" her blog is at http://my-leg-is-asleep.blogspot.com  ttyl
