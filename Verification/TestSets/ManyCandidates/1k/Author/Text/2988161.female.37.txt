We all have a place in life, and sometimes it is tough figuring out where we are.  I have always been an introvert which comes partially from moving around a lot when I was a young child.  Every 2-3 years we would pick up and move somewhere new, and I would start all over.  I loved actually going new places and seeing new things, and I was always able to make new friends - but over time it became difficult because I was not good at staying friends with the people I left behind.    I have kept a few close friends since high school/college, but those relationships have also become distant and much more casual.  Right now, I do not have any truly close female friends and I realize suddenly that I have become lonely for that.  My husband is and has been my best friend for nearly 20 years and I cherish that even when I sometimes take it for granted.  I do not know how to form that close connection to other people anymore.    It's kind of funny, but part of the reason we made our last move back to my homestate was because we had friends here already.  I'm just sad and disappointed that those friendships are not the same and that I don't have what I thought I did.
New day, new train of thought.  Just saw an old friend today.  He has been friends with DH for almost 20 years and like many old friends we drift in and out of each other's lives.  He is the first of our close friends to go through a divorce and it has been tough to see.  As difficult as things sometimes get in my own marriage I just can't see ever calling it quits.  I just imagine that there is always a way to work things out for the better.  Anyway, this friend is already moving on into a new marriage soon and we wish him all of the best.
Today is a strange day for me.  It is my husband's birthday (which is not the odd part) and he has been entertaining my son for the last hour without requesting my presence!  I have had time to read a few other blogs and websites that I follow - one of them being the wife of an old friend who writes about her grieving process after losing one of her 2.5 year old twins last summer.  I have admired her ability to express her emotions in such a public way... in this case over the internet.  One "nice" thing is the ability for people to check in on her and share in her pain unobtrusively.  People who are not comfortable with it do not have to read it and it gives her a safe way of expressing it --- she can mourn in a more private way.  I relate to her so well because I am also a mother of a single surviving triplet.    I look back on my own grieving process and it never goes away, although I have moved on for the most part.  I very rarely ever mention my own loss to people I am with in person anymore (It has been just over two years).  The first year was definitely the most emotional for me.  Now I am more detached.    Ahh....duty calls today.  It is time to go celebrate the birth of my DH and get the day moving!
We had playgroup today.  I just love doing that.  The kids all run around and I get a little bit of adult/social interaction.  It is kind of funny watching the kids together.  My son is very much like his father and me in that we tend to hang back and listen/watch more than anything.  Most of the other kids run off together, but not my little one.  He is content staying near the adults and playing by himself.  I hope he will grow out of that phase and become more outgoing/social with his own age group..... but he is only 2, as I have to keep reminding myself.   These playdates have truly been my sanity savers on occasion.  & ds takes a LOOOONNNGGG nap afterwards :-)
Somehow, I've had even less time for myself lately --- until today when I actually did not work in the store!  Right now I sit and wonder how I can be so incredibly self absorbed when I don't actually have the time to do much for myself.  Would I be LESS selfish if I had more time for me?  How do I make the balancing act work?  Other people manage.  Other people have spouses, children, and full lives and still have an abundance of time for themselves.
I have a 2 year old and no time for a normal life.  My goal is to find time for myself again.  Daycare is NOT an option. . . any other ideas?  If ignorance is bliss, why aren't more people happy?
Just getting by on a day-to-day basis right now.  I've been busy with my son's various daily activities this week and trying to think about the all important and murky business of finding a pre-school.  I don't even really know where to begin with that one.    Tomorrow we are blessedly unscheduled although I will probably run some errands.  We get busy again by Friday.  I'm up well past my bedtime now so it is difficult to think straight --- I'm missing out on any 'me' time again, although I have stayed clear of the store as much as possible.  DH is probably frustrated with that, but handling it well.    I did sign up for 30 free days at one of those 30 minute women's workout places.  I hear this one will even have a kids play area so I won't have that as an excuse anymore.  They are still under construction but should open in a few weeks.  Can't wait!
I'm back from vacation in Maui.  It was AWESOME.  My 2 year old was a great kid on the planes - which was one of my biggest c
