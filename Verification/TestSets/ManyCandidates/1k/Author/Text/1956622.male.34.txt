Woke up much earlier then I wanted to Karissa came into my room with grandma and played hide and seek with the door.  I was putting my arm out the door around the corner and trying to get her and she thought that was pretty funny.   Grandma got Karissa strawberries and yogurt for breakfast.  I have never seen anyone eat as many strawberries as Karissa can .    Today we went to the space needle.  Karissa said she really wanted to go up in the space needle so we went.  They have really changed the space needle since I went in it last.  We had our picture taken as we went in kind of like they do at Disneyland.  I held her in my arms all the way up in the elevator and she really liked looking out the window.  Once we got up in the space needle I was shocked at all that has changed.  I used to bring first dates to the space needle but now it is a complete tourist trap with a starbucks in it.  Karissa and I went out on the observation deck on the outside.  She like looking around but once we were up in it she was done.  We then went down and they drop us off in the gift shop.  We bought the picture.  Karissa really likes the picture so I got her one.  After we were done She wanted to ride the rides.  It was sure cold maybe it is me I am after all from Texas now but Karissa rode the kiddie rides and loved it.  She also wanted to go up in the ferris wheel with me.  I took her up there and she really enjoyed that smiled ear to ear.  She was even more crabby at bedtime about brushing her teeth.  I just don’t understand what happened she used to like brushing her teeth.
After driving 40 hours I arrived at my parents house.  I have had 2 hours of sleep in 40 hours so I am a bit tired.  It is 0530 my stepdad just left for work I am going to go sleep on the couch for a few hours as I am going to pick Karissa up later.  Picked Karissa up and left about 12-1 after dropping off toys at the house Lisa is staying at.  I actually met Karissa at the Drs. Office in Kirkland because Aunt Lisa had to take one of her kids to the Dr. and she is watching Karissa because my ex had a job interview this morning.  The look on Karissa’s face was wonderful.  I had a hard time holding back my tears.  She came out of the office and Karissa did not recognize me at first.  Then Aunt Lisa said Karissa who is that?  Karissa looked at me and her eyes got as big as plates, she took a deep breath and came running into my arms yelling “daddy”   I had to peel Karissa off me so I could walk.  Man she is so beautiful.  We spent the day in kind of a lazy mode I am bushed that ride took a lot out of me.  Karissa and I went to the store and did some shopping picked up some snacks and stuff.  Today was kind of shot for things to do as picking her up really took much longer then I wanted.  I met Lisa tonight for a couple of drinks and I thought we had a somewhat normal conversation.  Seeing her was difficult for me I know the things she has done but I care for her still.  I had to tell myself there is nothing here anymore.  She told me about how she is thinking about coming back to Houston.  She told me about how she is not happy at her brothers.  She said she will talk to the kids and let me know.  She said it is not fair to keep Karissa from her daddy.  The boys are used to it but Karissa is not.  I hope that happens.  I am excited to see Karissa and it would be cool to have her back in Houston  A couple of times today I did notice that Karissa does not talk to people or ignores them when you ask her to do things.  Like her crayons she spilled them on the floor and I asked her to help me pick them up and she refused.  In addition brushing her teeth at bedtime was a Major Chore.  This did not used to be the case.
Today Karissa woke up kind of cranky.  Not much I can afford to do today so we went to Wal-mart with Grandma.  Tara called while I was at Wal-mart and asked us if we wanted to come over and swim in her indoor pool at the apartment.   I bought a new floating swim suit for Karissa and a pair of trunks for me so we could go swimming.  She is really excited.    We met Tara and got in the pool.  Karissa had a great time she loves to swim glad to see she still does that.  I had her jumping off the edge and into the water with me.  I could not get her to do that before.    Afterwards we had dinner with Tara and Karissa fell asleep on Tara’s Lap.  I took her home.  It is kind of early so I put her to bed and went out with a friend to a later dinner at Red Robin.  My mother called me while I was at the movie Theater with my friend Kristen and said Karissa was quite warm.  I told Kristen that we would have to catch up later and I had to go.  On the way home I bought some medicine for Karissa.  When I got home I gave her some of the medicine it was quite a chore.  That did not used to be a problem either.  Putting up such a fight over the medicine woke her up so we were up late watching movies.
Well I am pretty much tapped on m
