And every time you feel like crying I'm gonna try and make you laugh And if I can't  If it just hurts too bad Then we'll wait for it to pass And I will keep you company for those days so long and black  And we'll keep working on the problem We know we'll never solve Of love's uneven remainders Our lives are fractions of a whole But if the world could remain within a frame Like a painting on a wall Then I think we'd see the beauty then We'd stand staring in awe    Bright Eyes   Might go to Bread Co. tomorrow. Might go to summer school this summer.    I can fail before I ever try.     .heart.
Horoscope (by Astrocenter.com) You are likely to be feeling especially friendly, outgoing and warm today, dear Pisces, people you meet, particularly those you meet through groups, are likely to be strongly attracted to you and want to form bonds with you. Friendships, partnerships, and romantic relationships should continue to grow closer, enhanced by your high level of communication. In the evening: Go out with those you love. Your bonds will be stronger for it.   Skyler came over yesterday: Didn't have time to write.  And, hey, my horoscope was right. Marc came over tonight and he put his arm around me, tickeled me.. all that flirty stuff. He, of course, has a girlfriend and told me not to tell anyone. He smelled my hair and put his arms around me and held me. I really needed that, I forgot how good it felt.   "It's okay to snuggle just... don't tell anyone..."    .heart.
Horoscope (by Astrocenter.com) There are opportunities open to you now, dear Pisces, whether you realize it or not. In fact, it may be quite hard to be aware of them today given the astrological weather. Your emotions may feel a bit restricted and weighted down and you may get the feeling like something is really trying to tie you down to earth. Realize that this is just a message from the universe reminding you that having at least one foot on the ground is key to manifesting your dreams   My soul feels heavy today. So do my feet.  I went to bed at 10 p.m., didn't fall asleep till midnight. Woke up at 5, took a shower, fed dogs, let them out.. looked everywhere for my Chemistry book for my homework I woke up early for. Couldn't find it anywhere. I need to find it or $50 will be going to the school.   Skyler's coming over tomorrow.  I came home today and Judy's mom was laying on the couch.... she knows our garage door number, so I guess she just comes in and lays on our couch now? She had my dog, too. It's kind of like.. "uh.. what are you doing here?" But we were taught to be polite even if someone invites themselves over. But really, I want her to leave. She has no business coming without calling -- and even more so, when no one is home?  Lack of sleep is getting to me, I know I'm being crabby.  Christian is starting to flirt with me and I feel like crying. I wrote him a note once giving my heart away. He tore it up. He's starting to slip in "I love you" into his sentances. He really shouldn't say things he doesn't mean. He has a band and asked me to go to his show, whenever it is. I said sure and he acted like a little boy that just got a toy car. "Really?! Promise?!" I can't like him again. =/  I really do mean it when I say I love Skunky. He's so original you can't help but love him. You'll never, ever meet another soul  close  to his.   Some girl at school said David does drugs. I corrected her immediatly. He doesn't, I know he doesn't. He hangs out with me all day, and plus he just had a drug test so Judy could prove to the therapist that her baby boy was clean.  I don't have much more to say.   Mon coeur fatigue    .heart.
Horoscope (by Astrocenter.com) Turn up the dial on your fantasy button and let your imagination run wild. Your intuition is strong today, dear Pisces, and you should give your emotions room to flow. Work to clear the blockages that might be preventing you from doing the things you truly want to do. Get your ideas down on paper and manifest more of your fantasy world here on earth. People may be rather stingy, so now is not the best time to ask for a raise or a loan.    I'm getting annoyed by my horoscope always including  dear Pisces . I know what sign I am, I don't need it included.  My fantasy button? I guess I've been holding back, but not too much. Yes, I've been botteled up, but only because I don't want to cry over Stuart -- again. I'm finally starting to talk to him again, and wow, I wish he was mine.  I'm confused about it, though. I  do  like him,  alot , but I know I told Dani I was over him. I really don't think I'll  ever  be  over  him, but I'll shut up for another year or two until I spill my guts again just so he gets a chance to try to scoop them back up and sew me back together. He's never completely successfull, and I feel it everytime I see him, everytime he smiles at me.  Everytime.   Kyle called for David. I want to encourage David to invite him over, but I don't want him to get suspicious. I just want to  see  him, that's all. Wonder what he looks like.  I got weighed at school today. 107.  I weighed myself at home today. 128. Something isn't right. 107 sounds good though, doesn't it? I'll weigh some 5lb weights on my scale, see if it's right.   I fantasize myself to sleep at night    .heart.
