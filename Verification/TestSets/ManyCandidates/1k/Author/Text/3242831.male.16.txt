Alcohol in the human body:   Ethanol, or more commonly known as alcohol, is found in a variety of popular beverages (bear, wine & spirits). It is one of the most used (and abused) drugs in our society. It is produced by the fermentation of fruits, vegetables, or grains by yeast which converts the carbohydrates into ethyl alcohol or ethanol. Alcohol can be taken up by any body surface, but is most efficiently taken up as it is usually consumed; after drinking an alcoholic beverage. When it enters the body, ethanol is absorbed over almost the entire length of the digestive tract. About 90% of ethanol consumed is absorbed into the blood stream, irrespective of the presence of food (food only slows the process down). Ethanol is then carried all over the body, particularly places, like the brain and the liver, which are highly perfused with blood. In the liver, ethanol is broken down by an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase into acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde is a poison which is the main cause of the harmful effects of alcohol consumption. Acetaldehyde is then converted into acetate by an enzyme called acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. Acetate is a harmless compound, used to create energy. It is estimated that the total amount of ethanol broken down per hour is in the range of 0.1-0.3 grams per kilogram body weight per hour. These fundamental processes are common to all human beings and sufficient to break down moderate quantities of alcohol. However, environmental factors (drinking habits) and genetic factors (activities of the enzymes involved) may affect the rate of alcohol metabolism. An example of this would be with about 40% of Asians, whose acetaldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme is inactive, meaning they have higher levels of acetaldehyde in the blood upon alcohol consumption, causing facial flushing, cardiac arrhythmia, headache and vomiting. When more alcohol than the mentioned above enzymes can break down is consumed, other enzymes will help with the break down of ethanol. The activity of these enzymes contributes to the toxicity and possibly carcinogenicity in alcoholics. Hardly any alcohol is excreted with urine, breath and tears, which means that practically all of it is broken down. 90-98% of consumed alcohol is broken down, 1-5% is excreted via the lungs and 1-3% is excreted via the other routes such as urine (0.5-2.0%) and sweat (up to 0.5%).  Alcohol depresses parts of the central nervous system, slowing down some of our brain functions. Various parts of the central nervous system are depressed by alcohol, with all sorts of consequences. For example, when the brain's speech centres are inhibited, this causes slurred speech; when the vision centres are affected this produces distorted vision; when the co-ordination centres are depressed this results in loss of balance and limb control. The strong depressant effect of alcohol lasts for a few hours after drinking, but alcohol also produces a weaker agitation (or irritation) of the nervous system that lasts much longer. This is the cause of the hangover and shakiness. It's due to the irritation of the nervous system by alcohol drunk many hours before. This effect often leads heavy evening drinkers to drink again the next morning, as the agitation can be temporarily overcome by drinking more alcohol. Thus, a vicious circle is set in motion, which can play a large part in alcoholic drinking patterns.
Trepanation   Trepanation is the drilling of a hole in the head. It is one of the oldest surgical practices and is still practiced religiously in some African tribes. When done properly, it will give the person to whom it was done to, a permanent 'high'. If your normal self is '0' and LSD is '100', a good dose of hash is lets say '50', then trepanation is about '30' (approximately 2 pints of lager); a nice feeling.
Twenty minute orgasm   The male pig is the mammal with the longest orgasm. When mating he will ejaculate a whopping half a pint of sperm. Then to make sure it doesn't just poor out of the female pig, he will ejaculate a sticky substance which blocks the hole. His penis is a cork screw shape (long, thin & curly). His orgasm lasts 20 minutes...
There are two types of people. There are those who eat to live and there are those who live to eat. i like to think i'm of the second group.
Tips on keeping sober:   -Drink one glass of milk before drinking alcohol. It lines the stomach and slows down the intake of alcohol into the blood stream. Remember, drinking it afterwards will have no effect. -Have a good meal before drinking. The food absorbs the alcohol and slows down the diffusion of alcohol into the blood stream. -Keep eating snacks which are offered to you (if they are). Not only does it slow keep up the amount of food in the stomach and small intestine, but it will also slow down the rate at which you drink. -Drink lots of water. For every glass of alcohol you drink, you must drink at least one glass of water. Alcohol decreases the release of ADH, therefore, more water is in the urine, therefore, you will be in the toilet a lot. But this means you must drink lots of water, to compensate for the extra water loss. -Moderate your drinking. Do not drink lots of alcohol in a short space of time, but spread this amount out over a longer period of time. Also you do not need to stick to alcohol; nobody is going to tell you off if you have a soft drink now and again. -Know your limit. If you start to feel as if you are forgetting the laws of gravity, stop drinking and switch to soft drinks or water. -Count your drinks. -Know what you are drinking.  -Keep an eye on your drink. It could be spiked while you are not looking.
