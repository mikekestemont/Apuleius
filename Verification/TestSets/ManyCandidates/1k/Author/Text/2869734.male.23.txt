Today i read in some magazine that "love is a bio chemical process that is triggered off in a small corner of one's brain when it gets the 'right neurochemical impulses'.....". What the f**k !?^$@#!^? Yeah thanks. Next they'll come up with some theory about how love and other emotions can be expressed an an infinite series of partial nth degree retro-harmonic semi - orthogonal functions. What is it with these people.. bored psychologists...morons. Ok so maybe there is some link between specific brain activity and love-like emotions but why trivialize it so much and make it sour. These guys even go to the extent of saying that the love between a mother and her child is because of so and so neural impulse in so and so part of the brain... thats really cool mr.scientists but all i'm saying is that when you know that your 'love' for someone is no more tha some bio-process in some nook of your brain its kinda ...well disappointing. I guess thats because we humans have a much more  respectful image of ourselves and our emotions. Its disheartening to know that you are just a biological process that will end someday like all processes. The're no dignity.. nothing special about us. Just a very complicated biological system. period.
Ever wondered what it is about booze that gets people going ? How is it that the simple looking colourless liquid (I'm talking about Romonov btw) makes even the deepest emotions tucked away in the corner of our hearts come chirping out. Heh heh... another brilliant testimony to this effect was on display on my hostel terrace (and later in BluePussy's room). There was laughing, crying, yelling and lots and lots of story telling ;)   I'm not going to write about the intricate details of the storytelling but let me say that now we all know each others families really well... on a first name basis...down to second cousins n all. Then there are some people who are simply unaffected by booze. One wonders what the're made of really.... Take RG for instance. Sober as an upside down tree! Keep it up RG.

Don't try to love someone. Don't even think about it. It will lead you to pain and misery. All attachment is futile. All emotion is mortal. But I don't ever give up, do I ? Fall once, Jump again. Fall again, jump again.   Every day the beauteous daughter  of the Sultan walked up and down  in the evening by the fountain  where the white waters splash,   Every day the young slave stood  by the fountain in the evening,  where the white waters splash;  every day he grew pale and paler.   One evening the pricess went up  to him and said suddenly:  "I wish to know your name,  your country and your kindred!"   And the slave said:  "My name is Mohamet,  I am from Yemen,  and my tribe is the Asras  who die when they love."

I was reading an introductory article on game theory today when I came across the phrase "doomsday device".. something that I'd heard in the movie ' urlLink Dr. Strangelove '. I didn't know this doomsday thing was for real! Apparently it was... the movie, ofcourse, is a satire.       The nuclear arms race that existed between the United States and the Soviet Union after WW II, led to the formation of an instance of a classic problem variant, known in Game theory, as the  urlLink Prisoner's Dilemma . Both the USA and the USSR maintained the following policy: If one side launched a first strike, the other threatened to answer with a devastating counter-strike. This pair of reciprocal strategies, which by the late stages of the cold war would effectively have meant blowing up the world, was known as ‘Mutually Assured Destruction’, or ‘MAD’. Game theorists objected that MAD was mad, because it set up a Prisoner's Dilemma as a result of the fact that the reciprocal threats were incredible. Suppose the USSR launches a first strike against the USA. At that point, the American President faces the following situation. His country is already destroyed. He doesn't bring it back to life by now blowing up the world, so he has no incentive to carry out his threat, which has now manifestly failed to achieve its point. Since the Russians know this, they should ignore the threat and strike first! Of course, the Americans are in exactly the same position. Each power will recognize this incentive on the part of the other, and so will anticipate an attack if they don't preempt it. The expected outcome is therefore a race between the two powers to be the first to attack.    This game-theoretic analysis caused genuine consternation and fear on both sides during the Cold War, and produced some rather bizarre attempts at setting up strategic commitment devices. President Nixon, for example, had the CIA try to convince the Russians that he was insane, so that they'd believe that he'd launch a retaliatory strike even when it was no longer in his interest to do so. Similarly, the Soviet KGB leaked fabricated medical reports exaggerating Brezhnev's senility with the same end in mind. Ultimately, the Americans broke this deadly symmetry by using a ‘doomsday device’. They equipped a worldwide fleet of submarines with enough missiles to destroy the USSR, and arranged their communications technology in such a way that the President could not be sure to be able to reach the submarines and cancel their orders to attack if any Soviet missile crossed the radar ‘trigger line’. Of course, this strategy depended on making sure that the Russians were aware o
