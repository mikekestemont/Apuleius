two words to the wise: wine drunk.  that's right, wine drunk.  it's great.  it's hip, it's the power trip, man, you gotta try it.  forget your woes, forget the blues, forget the CEO on your ass, just grab a bottle and down the hatch.  then watch a creepy movie, with a friend who falls asleep, so you're left in the middle of something you can't really clear from your head.    yeah, i'm a little crazy, but fuck you, you don't read this!  i can say whatever i want!  and the CARNIVORE doesn't care, because they know i'm just a blonde little nobody.  puh-lease, throw me a bone!  speaking of crazy, i forgot to take the crazy pill today, that must mean even more craziness!  come over to my place, and eat a banana, and watch CSI and hang out with my cat, because that's what i do.  rain or shine.  shitfan or plain mist.  until tuesday, the 25th.    so here's one for you.  a man walks onto a street.  a pedestrian street.  and starts to paint, the most amazing things you've ever seen.  is he an artist?  or a vagrant?  what do you do, treat him like raphael?  probably not.  you probably look at him and think, "poor fucker, why can't he get a real job?"   pathetic you.  you lose, game over, you're out of quarters.
online diaries, how ironic.  don't expect to read my deepest darkest secrets on here, i would never go that far.  i'm doing this because i'm bored, i'm jumping on the blogger bandwagon, so many of my friends, and sister, have one.  i'm bored, and wanted to leave a comment on newman's blog spot, and couldn't do that unless I signed up, so, "fuck it" i said, it's 2:30 in the morning and i've got nothing better to do than sleep and bother my cat.    so, i graduated saturday, hurrah for me!  it was exciting, and then i came home, all my family departed, and i slept like the dead until 4pm today.  now to prepare for the next step, going to washington, d.c.  yeah, i'm partaking in the great intern experience.  i wonder if i'm gonna have to take out my piercings? hmm...all summer will be spent in the capitol.  after that, round and round and round she goes where she lands or ends up no one really knows for sure.  i damn well better be in grad school by fall 2005, so if you have any suggestions on where to do grad studies in virology just let me know...  but for now, i'm going to go share my deep dark secrets with myself.   au reviore or however the fuck you spell it....
I always have a good time reading Nick's blog.  Hearing the stories about him and women.  Sometimes I wonder how he hasn't been punched in the face yet.  I know I've wanted to do that a few times.  But I have to appreciate the way he torments the girls who deserve tormenting.  (That's an understatement.  I'm mean, and I LOVE stupid girl bashing) I miss you nick!  I've wasted yet another day at work.  It is beautiful outside, it's not even hot, but it is warm, and sunny, and gorgeous, and there are squirrels and happy people and puppies...and i get to stay in this stupid little room.  Se la vie.  Hedish you'd better be reading this.  Maybe this weekend i'll have some stories to tell.
haha, i'm a paranoid idiot.  pretty much right after my last bitch session, guess who calls?  you've got it, the guy.  i wasn't stood up, i haven't been emmitting man repellent after all.    so, friday night was great!  we went to the date party, at this club in D.C. called H2O.  totally not my kind of place, but it was a lot of fun.  i met many different people.  all single and lonely.  i did cheat, by bringing a date to a single's date party, but i don't care.  it wouldn't have been as much fun!  even more fun ensued afterwards ;)~  saturday i hung out with julie, michelle and tommy.  we had a slumber party.  tommy really likes running around in his TINY boxer briefs, and it scares julie and michelle's other roommate.  she gets pissed off every time.  i just think it's funny.  hey, at least he was vacuuming!  my ass feels like it's going to fall off of my body.  i worked out yesterday, for the first time in months.  OUCH  now, i'm at work, where i refuse to lick 200 something envelopes.  where's the fucking sponge?!?
the telephone is a blight to my worrying side.   so, i met a guy a couple of weeks ago.  we've planned to go out TOMORROW, and i haven't talked to him since last wednesday.  my pessimism and inmy realism is telling me he won't call, and i'll be flying solo yet again.  let's see, he'll count for #4 since march, of Men Who Have Stood Me Up. I think i have a gene that creates a pheremone-like chemical called man-repellent.    work still sucks.  i'm still trying to find a job, that pays, that is in a lab, that is not completely bullshit secretarial work.  at least laura is cool.  we share an office.  funny story, to counter all the negativity i seem to spew in here: evidentially, according to my roommate here in D.C., i say very foul things in my sleep.  last week, i yelled "shut the fuck up!" at her when she woke up shrieking from a nightmare.  she actually thought i was conscious and angry.  she also told me this is not the first time i've said this too her  in my sleep.    my boss's goldfish is schizo.
So.  I've been in Washington, D.C. for 4 weeks.  for those of you reading this (like that's anyone), I am a D.C. intern.  Now, don't think i've sold out completely.  The little non-profit i work for is called CAST, or the Council for Agricultural Science and Technology.  I'm supposed to be doing the prep work for this national essay c
