There was a question posed on http://www.lasisters.org recently. Someone asked why did people become a "Sister".   For those who don't know who I am talking about, I am referring to the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence.   Here is my answer.   Too often people only look at the messenger and not hear the message. (yeah..I know there are some pretty hot looking messengers!) Anyways, I feel as though being a Sister you lose a bit of your individual identity. In as much, you are able to carry the message to others as more of a part of a larger entity than as an individual. You are no longer “Bob, 35, gay, computer tech”.   In face you become “Sister Rhoda Rooter” and are able to carry on the mission of the Sisters.   I have often stated that I don’t feel as though I don’t quite fit in totally anywhere. To be in one group it sometimes feel as though I must deny another part of who I am. Watching the Sisters and getting to know them, it feels as though who they are (labels) isn’t important to the greater good of the group. It seems as though it is about a collective of good souls coming together for common goals.   How I choose to intimately love (or lust) on my own time isn’t a factor here. It is how I choose to care for others in general, seems to be a determining factor in becoming a Sister.   Perceived value is a theory that I subscribe to very much. I see the effort and dedication that it takes to become a Sister and that really draws me in even more. I admire those who have become FPMs. Those who are in the process of becoming FPMs have my respect as well. They give me something to reach for. There is a definite push for each member to better themselves as a person. There is a push for each person to give of themselves without asking for anything in return. There doesn’t seem to be much time to stagnate. Ever pushing, ever testing, ever so gently (or not so gently..lol) expanding each person to reach just a bit deeper into their being to grow inside.   This makes me want to dig deeper into myself and grow as a person as well. It takes the fear out of introspection and enables me to have the courage to face my own character defects. It shows me that there ARE others who give of themselves and understands the fulfillment that it brings all of its own.   I don’t want to be only bisexual, heterosexual, female, switch, mother, daughter, or any of the labels that society has given me. I want to recreate my being to allow all those parts of me to come out as one whole spirit.  WnW
How much you know.....until I know how much you care.   This is me posting.. as a submissive...stripping my dominant side away totally.    You can correct me if i am wrong..   if i know in my heart it is to teach me i will listen. Because i know you only have my best interest in mind.   But, if i feel it is only to make me feel 'stupid' or prove you are smarter than me, i won't hear a word you say.   You can guide me in the right direction..   if i know in my heart it is for MY best interest i will follow.   But if i feel that it is being done only to serve your needs and you are disregarding what the BEST course for me to follow might be... i will go the other way.   You can tell me of your experiences...  if you listen to mine as well and respect how i feel i will faithfully recall each of your fears, joys and everything in between and be mindful of them in everything i say and do.   But if i feel that you wantonly have disregarded my feelings and not taken them into consideration when you speak and act.. i will close myself off to you and be only concerned with protecting myself.   I need to know you care before i care what you know. Love me and i am yours... i will follow you to the ends of the world and give you my undying devotion.   Try and take the stance of being the Master of my world instead of first becoming the Master of my heart... and i will rebel and neither of us will be content..nor will we survive.   Conquer my heart and I won't even put up a battle for my world.. it will be gift wrapped and handed over freely.    WnW
I experienced something this weekend that has set me free in so many ways.   I am normal. How can I explain that? For so long I have thought I was damaged or doing something wrong in my submission. I tried to understand and dig deep into myself and find out why I felt like I did while I was in a scene. Why did I cry? Why did I find anger welling up inside of me? Why did I find that I began to hate, only to process it into the deepest love and admiration I have ever felt for anyone in my life?  Why did each scene feel as though I was fighting every step of the way? In essence, fighting for my very life?   I have listened to people say that ‘breaking’ a sub is wrong. I believed that was what happened to me each time. I felt like I was being broken down. I felt as though I needed to have the power, real or perceived, taken away from me. Any illusion of control needed to be removed by whatever means necessary. I submitted myself to have that control removed. The process was never nice. Not in the context of any romance novel or erotic fiction.   For so long I listened to the fantasies of others and their concept of beautiful submission and erotic rituals. I felt less t
