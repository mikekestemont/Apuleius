went to the christian youth group's movie nite held at this girl's new richmond apartment, for the film "bruce almighty". hmm what, it was in the theatres last yr when i was soo busy with graduation and going to japan, that i didn't have time to go watch the film. saw the trailers at the time tho and it seemed really funny and i had actually wanted to go see it. and later on i heard that it was the best-selling jim carrey movie of all time. but i have to say, it wasn't as good as i thought it would be.. but maybe that's just me. oh well, it was still a funny film, and i really need all the entertainment i can get these days to go out and have fun, so that i can take my mind off from reality.  was so funny to know that the chiropractor friend eric was into 'sex & the city'.. i never know guys would be interested in that series as well! well he's a weird one i guess, haha. kept asking the apartment owner girl if he could borrow all the dvd for the complete seasons. but well, i guess guys could really learn something about girls and how they view sex from that series, so it's good. guys should go see that show! lol  met a girl there tonite tho. she's new to the group like me. it's actually her first time there and she went all by herself, brave~ and she really seems like a nice person and we got into chatting pretty well. plus, she lives in kerrisdale too, so it's really great cuz i can go hang out with her easily since she's so close by. and the other great thing is, she wants to see "Fahrenheit 911" too! so yay! i can go catch the film with her! all my other friends are not interested in a documentary like that. i thought sami would wanna see the film, since she majored in IR and is in law school now and stuff, i thought she'd be interested in this kind of political documentary, and we watched "the corporation" together. but well, so since the only person i know who might have wanted to see the film turned out to be not interested, i had to find those church friends, cuz i know some of them might be the type who'd be interested in this kinda film. and i was rite, someone else there tonite actually brought up the topic, and immediately 2-3 other ppl were all saying they wanna see the film. but huh, i guess i'll go ask this new girl to go see it with me, cuz we live close to each other~ haha  was quite glad tonite actually in meeting and getting to know her, cuz well, whaddaya know, you lose a friend somewhere but you gain a friend elsewhere too~ (^-^)v
after getting DiorKiss in a hurry, cuz i was sorta already late, then went to pick up sami to meet up with mindy for dinner. found that book "wild swans" at sami's place. about 3 weeks ago i had an interview with a president of a real estate firm. ppl always ask me if i'm chinese or japanese cuz i can speak both languagues. after he found out i'm chinese, he asked me whether or not i've read this book called "wild swans" which i said no.. and he then went on to telling me what the book was about. apparently the grandma had foot-binding and used to be a concubine.. so he was like "well you know, so the warlord locks her up in a room and just goes to have sex with her once in a while".. and i was sorta feeling shocked but also laughing out loud in my mind.. cuz wow, i never ever thought that i would hear the actual word "sex" during an interview!! (^-^);; a friend was like "huh, maybe you would've got the position if you've read the book and know about it!" hah oh well... but it's always interesting to read new books anyways, and this one has been on my mind ever since that interview, so i borrowed the book~ gonna read it on my flight back to taiwan next week.. hah.  had dinner at pearl castle in continental. and hmm... i think i saw a guy whom i just met online this past week. gonna ask him tomorrow where he was tonite to see if it's really him tho.  went to silvercity riverport with sami to catch the film "the notebook" and wow even tho it's a friday nite, the place was soo packed! even more so than the opening nite for Harry Potter!! was quite shocking actually.. and not just for me only. some guy was really surprised how packed the place was too that he came to ask me what film i'm gonna watch.. hah.. but well then later i figured out it's got to be due to "Fahrenheit 911", and my guess was correct! there were TONS of ppl lining up for that film, *way* more than for HP!! i actually really wanna see the film too, being a fan of michael moore's books cuz well i'm anti-bush (even tho i support his stand on tw/china issues being pro tw independence). but well this film can wait.. i'm not in that a hurry.. besides, i don't really wanna watch that kinda heavy material on a friday nite. went to watch "the corporation" on a fri nite and even tho it was a pretty good documentary, i fell asleep towards the 2nd half cuz well 2nd half wasn't as good as the 1st half.. and it was like 10pm-12am.. and i vaguely remembered i had few hrs to sleep the previous nite too having an interview that day.  but anywayz, wow, what can i say for "the notebook"... it's like the best romantic movie i've seen in yrs!!! i totally love it!!! it's going up there in my list o
