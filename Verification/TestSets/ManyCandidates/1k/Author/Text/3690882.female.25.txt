Holy Shit!  I didn't expect film school to be this intense.  I suspected that it would be 9-6 each day with no homework.  It's turned out to be 9-6-occasionally-9 and I have to give up a day and a half this weekend to do a continuity film project.  I'm learning a lot, but I wanted to have more time to have fun.  I'm trying to work my personal schedule around my film school duties, but it is going to be difficult.  On the bright side, I like all of my classmates and I've been having a great time with them, when we aren't exhausted.  Rob, Maria and Sarah are dropping by this Saturday and I hope that I can get away from filming long enough to hang with them.  I've decided not to pay the overinflated gym prices and just rely on walking and other exercise this summer as I've had hardly any time outside of school and painting the town red with Lexi.  We went to Hairspray yesterday, which was a blast.  I love live theater because the show can change and respond to current events.  The actors were joking about the possible broadway strike and about how Bush stole the election in 2000.  Gotta go to get enough sleep for tomorrow.  Bye
On Saturday, I went to the  urlLink Frick Collection  (1 E70th Street, near the park).  It's this gorgeous old mansion where Henry Clay Frick put his personal art collection.  Every available surface is covered with art, plus there are free-standing statues.  It's smaller than a regular museum - it was house, if a big one - but all the art is good. You know how sometimes you go to  urlLink some museums  and there's a whole room with nothing in it but a toilet and a sign declaring that it (the toilet, not the sign) is Meaningful Art? There's none of that here. Henry Clay Frick had good taste. (Or, possibly, 'modern art' meant something different in 1900.)  They said that almost half the stuff is from his original collection - the directors don't replace pieces often.  One of the unique things about this collection is that it's mostly "happy" art, like it would be pleasant to have hanging over your dinner table. (My dad once bought a painting depicting a battle scene that somehow involved bleeding horses, and insisted on putting it in the dining room.  Eating steak became much more difficult with the painting there.  Eventually my mother relegated the painting to the basement.)  One room has a lot of landscapes and portraits of very serious people - but in the middle of that is Jean-Baptiste Greuze's "The Wool Winder", which is of a girl trying to wind up a ball of yarn, except a kitten is tugging on the loose ends. That's my favorite. The kitten looks so playful, and there's a remarkable amount of detail that brings the painting to life.  There's also a self-portrait by Rembrandt. And that got me thinking - how did artists do self portraits back then?  Did they even  have  mirrors in the 1600s? I guess they probably did.  But still, it seems hard to hold a pose and paint it at the same time. So maybe he was guessing about what he looked like, or painting the picture to be the way he wanted to look.   Some of the artists did really clever things with light.  In  urlLink The Education of the Virgin , the candlelight casts sharp light on one subject but a softer, diffused light on the other subject.  But it all looks really accurate - better than 3D rendering programs do today.  My favorite portrait is the one of Thomas More.  In most portraits, the person is usually looking off into space sort of blankly, or maybe smiling.  In this one, Thomas More has this profound look of resignation, like there's a really good baseball game on but somebody has told him he has to sit  right there  until the painting is finished, and he's tried very hard to argue his way out of it, but finally given up.  This is a fabulous collection all around, and the century-old mansion is a great comfy setting for it.
Hello, this is Andrew on Lexi's account (blogger's slow to email me my access to this blog).  For a first day in New York, today was not bad at all.  After a nice brunch as Nisos (176 8th Ave.), which serves up a lot of new age diner cuisine (club sandwiches with brie and the like), we did some shopping for a pair of rollerblades for me.  My first attempt to skate was cut short as we could not get to the park because of the gay pride parade.  Undaunted, we decided to get some tickets to Fahrenheit 9/11 and then find a new park to practice.  It just happened that Michael Moore was giving an interview at the theater right then.  I couldn't get a great picture of him, but I did get interviewed by NY1 and was shown on the nightly news giving an excellent elocution of a rather bland sound bite.  Though we arrived at the theater a little after 3pm, we couldn't get tickets for anything earlier than the 8:15 showing, which isn't surprising now that we found out it made box office records as the first documentary to outgross its competitors on opening weekend.    With the 4 hours we had before our showing, Lexi did her best to help me get the hang of rollerblading.  I fell twice.  Managed not to run into anyone.  And somehow got a bruise on the arm that I didn't land on?  It's like the right and left sides of my body have that same thing the Crimson Twins from GI-Joe had going on.  Apparently I can hit a pole at full speed with my right arm and get a nice purple bruise on my left.  It's quite disconcerting  After two hours of practice, we stopped for dinner at Cosi (841 Broadway), which specializes in artisan bread sandwiches. I
