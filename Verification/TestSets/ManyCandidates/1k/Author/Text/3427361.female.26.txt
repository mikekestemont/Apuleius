coffee. and we're waiting for them to deliver our new mattress set. i can't wait. yay! new furniture. it stormed last night again. lots and lots of big storms and some tornadoes and bright lightning and low deep rumbling thunder that rumbled on and on and on. it was such a strange afternoon. it was such a strange night. but we did get a lot done while we were down there on tornado watch. loran painted a bookshelf. i cleaned some. we decided to get rid of our couch down there and tear the floor up and we're gonna put new tile down and i love doing stuff like that. cleaning and fixing up. when the time is right, i love it.  i dreamt of a grocerystore last night. i dream about that a lot. going shopping at the market. walking up and down aisles. but it doesn't look like a normal grocerystore. and i'm always there w/a lot of people. and i never actually get through the checkout line. i always end up doing a lot of other things.   last night we sat in the garage while it poured rain outside. drank high life out of the can. i had on my slip and cardigan and pink rain boots and there were big puddles to walk in.
i do love me some  urlLink carmizzle . & she's made her blog into a place where she can put her writing snippets. and since i don't have anything to post tonight, i thought i'd post some snippets of my own. and so.  ***this is from a piece i've had sitting around for awhile. i don't know where it's going and i don't know where it's been, but. so.       He reminds me of bus stations. And the only time I’ve actually ever spent time in bus stations were those dark cold nights when I’d ride with my dad to pick up my grandma.  And he’d give me a quarter to watch one of the little black and white teevees bolted to the chairs. I’d watch The Cosby Show or The Andy Griffith Show until the screen would pop and shrink and disappear. And by then, my grandma would be standing there, a slight smile on her face and a small hard navy blue suitcase in her hands.  The cold would be sitting on her collar, her short curled grey hair, smelling of Detroit.  And we’d ride into the west end of town, dropping her off at the sidewalk of her small white clapboard house.  I’d say goodbye to her and she’d always lean down and say goodbye back. But she wouldn’t look at me.  She rarely looked at me.  ***       He reminded me of bright red rainboots. The driving rain.  The Rolling Stones.  The best burrito I’ve ever had.  Staying up late and mimosas and lady jazz singers and cigarettes and Christmas eve and holding hands and the squeak of a guitar.  Big around the neck hugs when someone steps off the bus.  Someone you’ve waited your whole life to kiss.  Someone who will tear their hair out when you die.
"ease your feet into the sea" by belle & sebastian is such a nice song. it's so calm and perfect. hammocks and water w/lemon wedges and bare feet and swimming and kissing.  i was gonna take some digipics but my camera is out of batteries. and i don't know where the others are. boo.  i was just gonna show you my new gap pants. b/c i love to shop. and i'm always stoked when i find something cool. they're sorta pinkish and capri and lovely.  one of my favorite outfits of all time is a tank top and panties. i'm telling you, i'd wear it out if i could. like to target and the coffeeshop and you name it. (even though i'm sure i'd slip on my jeans for church and all.)

but i don't really mind it all that much. at least the wind is cool. and the windows are open.
so strange having a blog. heh. but blogger sure has jazzed itself up, hasn't it? i do say so. hm. i always used to have an lj and a blog. so. since i don't have lovelylight anymore. i'll swing off of blogspot for awhile. why not.  and i guess i won't really be putting any sort of different stuff here than i do at my lj, but still. it's always fun making new online stuff. i do miss lovelylight. but it was time to let it go. it just was. and so i did. but who knows. i may own a domain again one day. or not. i never know stuff like that until it happens to me.  i think i'm addicted to mouthwash. the tingling. i love it.  i need to drink more water.
test.
On the way home, I was thinking of calling Nan to see if she wanted to get coffee or something,  but Ruby was sitting in front of my house.  She was on my stoop drinking a cherry slush. She smiled a
