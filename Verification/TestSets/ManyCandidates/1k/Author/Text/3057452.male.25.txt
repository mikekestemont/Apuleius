Yes, things have come back around for us again!  I met with a mortgage broker this afternoon and managed to qualify us for an additional $15,000 more than our bank originally would and we can now get the new home we originally wanted.  We got the offer to purchase paperwork emailed from our Realtor tonight and just need to sign and deliver it to get going.  The house already has a lot and a basement dug, and once the purchase details are hammered out we'll be all set!  By the looks of it, we should have a brand new  urlLink Dundee  home by around October 1st.  You gotta love life's ups and downs!
Ok, we declined the afore mentioned house we were keen on buying before the inspection.  Aluminum wiring is just too big of a pain.  Sure some say its fine, but when you ask an electrician whether he would buy an aluminum wired house, I guarantee they'll say no.    Ok, so we're on to plan B.  The market here is ridiculous, houses have offers the same day they're listed!  We're going back to the prospect of building brand new.  My realtor just managed to secure us with one hell of a deal with a new house.  I wasn't too excited about the floor plan as compared to the one we originally wanted (which went up $10,000!) but its definitely do-able.  The costs involved with a new house are pretty much on par with what it will cost to fix up an older home, so what the hell.  New home here we come!  Oh...Just that little financing problem...I won't even go into the scam my wife almost got caught up in...yet.  Sleazy, sleazy business there (thats from the help her parents offered us..thanks again).  Anyway, I'm going to try using a mortgage broker on Monday in the hopes of getting a better deal and higher approval.  Crossing my fingers.
Today has been waaay too stressful! House inspection turned up problems, and to top it all off...My wife's parents are being complete assholes.  Where to begin!!  One of our conditions of purchasing our new home was to have a home inspection done first.  This was done earlier today, and it has turned up more problems than we hoped for.  Our biggest concern right now is the fact that the entire upstairs has  urlLink aluminum wiring .  I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with this risk.  The inspector also found that all of the windows will need replacing, as they are all 30 yrs old.  The insulation in the attic needs an upgrade, and there is an issue with land sloping towards the house in the backyard. The toilet in the bathroom upstairs has been leaking into the surrounding area, and damage cannot be seen until the lino is removed. These are the major concerns.  I won't go into the other minor problems and cosmetic issues that need to be dealt with eventually.  I have until Friday to take it or walk away.    And finally the In-Laws...Dun dun dun.  My wife does not deal with stress well.  So of course her parents are completely opposed to us purchasing an older home.  They want us to buy brand new, which would be great.  However we're about $10,000 shy of ever affording that.  Think they would pony up that cash?  Not a chance in hell.  They're throwing bullshit at my wife about the cost of re-shingling ($5000..I don't think so) and that the street is too busy and the house is a dump (they haven't even seen it).  They don't seem to understand that we know how to look into the costs ourselves.  We've called for estimates on the repairs needed and we will decide if the house is worthwhile or not. It's why we forked out the money for an inspection in the first place!!  Now my wife and her Mom always fight, and I usually manage to stay out of it. But I'm starting to get more than slightly pissed with them about there negative stance.  Stay the hell out of it if you don't like it!  Ok. Stress rant over.  For now.  Feeling slightly better.
So, after putting up with my  urlLink cable internet  service for the past 4-5 years, with its constant outage annoyances and Catholic School strictness on bandwidth, I decided it was time to check out the competition.  And what choices there were- we only have 2 ISPs up here.  The competition being  urlLink Telus , I gave them a call and asked about switching.  Everything sounded great, cheaper monthly bill, integrated phone service bundle, free modem rental, less strict on bandwidth usage and a bonus mp3 player.  Exactly what I wanted, sign me up!    So the modem arrived on Friday and after returning from my weekend camping trip, I unpacked it and set it up. One problem, no connection.  A quick call to Telus Tech Support informed me my phone line to the modem might be too long, so I traded off a long phone line for the recommended longer Ethernet cable.  Still no dice.  "Tech Support will come by on Tuesday between 8:30 am and 5:00pm."  They showed up at about 12:45pm which was handy as I was still home for lunch.  He informs me that my condo building has had problems connecting to there service and likely won't work.  He does some tests and tweaks what he can, but no dice.  Service unavailable.  Thank you Telus sales for telling me it was available and then wasting my time!  It's not this guys fault, so I thank him and let him on his way.  Luckily I haven't had a chance to cancel my cable internet yet, so at least I don't have to beg for it back.  Next up... a very annoyed call to my Telus salesperson.  Oh yes, you will be doing something to make me happy!
Yes, we made an offer on Friday and they accepted! It's not the brand spanking new house we were originally hoping to build, but it is perfect.  A huge backyard leading d
