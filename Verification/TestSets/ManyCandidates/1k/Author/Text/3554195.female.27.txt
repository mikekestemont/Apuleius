I need to get the fuck out of the US of A this weekend.  In honor of 'merika's birthday, I'm going to Canada.  This is one of the best ideas I've had in a really, really long time.  So good that celebrating the 4th in Canada may, just may, become an annual event.    What's my point?  I don't really have one, but if you know any good places in Vancouver that are not to be missed I need to know about them, like NOW.  So go on, tell me where I should go.  I'm anxiously awaiting your suggestions.
Yesterday I wore a new skirt.  A skirt that I bought a couple weeks ago in downtown when I went shopping because I was too drunk to drive home after visiting Von's with some coworkers, a skirt that I realized was too long for me two days ago when I tried it on at home, a skirt that although I was not then drunk decided instead of returning I would shorten with only a pair of scissor and no needle or thread, a skirt that despite the fact that it ends with fraying and raw edges and nothing else looks pretty kick ass.  Man, I  love  that the 80s are back!  And ever since I attacked my new skirt a couple nights ago, my scissors can't stop yammering on and on about what a great team we'd make.  Asking me for old sweatshirts and t-shirts, saying that when she's done taking it out on that sweater or this sweatshirt, Tootie's gonna be so jealous and Rickie Schroder's gonna wanna be my steady.  And all I can think is gag me with a spoon.  Like totally.  P.S.  I finally caved in and joined the darkside (and by darkside I mean ProClub).  That's right.  I'm officially a total yuppie sell out.  Now the only thing that's missing is a SUV and becoming a Republican.  Sure I say NEVER  now , but I use to say that about THE CLUB.  Dunt-dunt-daaaaaa!
Growing up my mom was always buying me pink clothes. Being a typical kid I hated almost any article of clothing my mom picked out for me, but especially anything pink. I remember one item of clothing particularly well, a pink corduroy skirt overall outfit. I hated this outfit so much that I made a point of telling my mom she was forbidden from buying me anything else in the realm of pinkness which included red and purple. Anyways, looking back now it’s odd because if I look at the last 10 things I've purchased clothing-wise I'd say the majority are PINK! And to be honest, I have to say right now my favorite color is PINK! I love PINK! If pink was a guy I would totally ask him to marry me. Simply put, I can't get enough PINK!   Clothing items I own that are pink:     Light pink capri pants (What the hell was I thinking? And yet I can’t stop wearing them. Man, I’m a dork.)   Light pink and black a-line skirt with flowers (Retroville baby. All the way!)   Light pink chunky cotton sweater (The comfiest damn sweater EVER.)   Hot pink cardigan sweater   Pink corduroy a-line skirt (Interesting side note: I hated corduroy as a kid as well. I’m still a little wary of it.)   Pink and cream toille a-line skirt   Various flower pins in various shades of pink    I'm sure there are more but a) I'm getting bored with listing them b) you don't really care anyways and c) I believe I've made my point.   Actually the more that I think about it maybe I love pink so much now because I hated it that much way back when because I also couldn't stand turtleneck sweaters and now every fall I get giddy when it's time to pull out the turtleneck sweaters and start cycling them through my wardrobe in heavy rotation.   P.S. I'm wearing a HOT PINK cardigan right now. Gawd, I'm such a girl.   P.P.S. Yup, I've got a pink turtleneck sweater as well.   P.P.P.S. Nope, I don't have a pink corduroy sweater. Well not yet anyways.   P.P.P.S. Let's call this my  urlLink Totally Out There Tuesday  post even though I completely forgot about wanting to do that until after I posted this. Oops! Next week, next week.
I've got nothing but love for you people.   urlLink Enjoy !  That's right.  I'm risking fines and imprisionment, sacrificing my freedom and reputation, just to spread the joy. C'mon, admit it. You watched that show too and loved every minute of it just as much as I did.   What?  You don't know what I'm talking about???  Greatest American Hero?  Here's a quick recap of the coolest/crappiest TV show ever: Ralph Hinkley was minding his own business, when his car mysteriously drove itself out into the desert. A startled Ralph was soon visited by aliens, who had decided to endow him with superhuman powers to fight the battle against injustice and crime. To this end, they gave him a special suit and an instruction manual. Unfortunately, Ralph manages to lose the instruction manual, and the aliens have a nasty habit of never being around when you need them.   You're welcome.
Saturday afternoon I treated my parents to a live taping of  urlLink Prarie Home Companion  at Marymoor Park in Redmond.  Then just to balance things out I went downtown to see F9/11. I'm suprised to admit that I enjoyed Bowling for Columbine more than Moore's latest offering.  In other news, I have this sudden urge to run out to the store and find me a shirt which reads "Closed Mondays".  By the way, what are you doing here?  Don't you realize you could be reading much, much more amusing stuff like  urlLink this ?  Well, what are you waiting for?  Go.  P.S.  This post is going nowhere fast.  Goodbye.
Do you ever wish life was a game of four square, in which you can't agree if the ball just landed on the line or out of bounds, so you call a redo?  Yea, me too.
