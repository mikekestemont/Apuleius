I'm so tired. Brian and I eneded up having a "discussion" until 3:30am I'm at work trying to keep my brain functioning with only 2.5 hours of sleep and am failing miserably. I'm not in the best of moods otherwise either since the "discussion" is practically a repeat of the one 3 weeks ago which means that I pour my heart out, and doesn't even register for a month. I've been trying to say the same thing in different ways at least every other month for 10 years and I'm just explained out... If I have to have this conversation with him again, I think I'll just implode.
Amanda is getting so sick.. She missed school yesterday and today she had to come home twice! She went to school, but came home to sleep another hour, went back to school after lunch and the nurse calls me at work to come get her. She's zonked out on the couch getting annoyed because I keep telling her DRINK WATER... She doesn't deal with stress well and it's just wearing her down, and even though I know I didn't create this situation, I still feel responsible since I'm so deeply involved in it, so she feels bad because I feel guilty, which makes me feel even worse so here we sit on the precipice of a downword spiral with nothing to hold on to, but one another as we're pulled into it knowing that we'll still be holding on when we're through it. Poop.   On to other stuff.... I went and made my very own laminated TO DO list at work today. With it being laminated I can use it as a dry erase board and it works really slick (Oh the things I can do with binder clips and sheet protectors!) Unfortunately I filled the damn thing up so fast that I should have used legal paper! I've been given so many little jobs lately that I was starting to forget things, so I thought I'd write them down along with their priority of high, medium and low. The bad thing is that it created yet another little job... 3 people want their own now! Linda is calling me a "crafty ass" again... it's one of the greatest compliments she gives! I discovered a bonus with having it hanging up for all to see... I was asked to write up a document, and told him to just add it to the list.. when he saw the list he asked Kathryn. :) Of course she griped about it, worked through her break to do it, and then got pissy because I took mine, but no one asked her to do that. There is a term for someone who will do what you ask, but make you sorry you asked in the first place. It's not passive aggressive or passive resitant.. I'll remember eventually.   I have to attend the CMMS training conference with my supervisor tomorrow. I hate conferences... No matter what the topic is, it is always the same schmoozy people with their fake smiles and lame attempts to cover the fact that they can't remember your name... JUST BE HONEST PEOPLE! My feelings won't be hurt if you say you forgot my name, but when you lie and pretend, and act pleased that you fooled me, I'm just going to be annoyed! Is that really so difficult a concept to grasp? And then there are always the keynote speakers droning on about all sorts of things you've heard a million times before, but trying to do it in a way that makes you believe it's all new info that will change your life. That's not to say conferences are bad things... just not the way I prefer to learn new things or meet new people.
This poor man is so confused. Part of me is so filled with pity, but I'm keeping my caretaker instincts in check because I know it would only exacerbate his confusion. He has twisted and turned things so much in his brain that he actually thinks I have a restraining order against him, and that I think he's going to molest Amanda because of our concerns about Johnny Miller (a level 3 sex offender) who is living 2 blocks away from us. He made a public post to Teri's group about what he believes is going on after he read about my conversation with Dawn my diary. (Which he read after he said he would move on, not that I'm surprised, but it really shows anyone that has even a mild grasp of logic that what he says and what he does are two entirely different things.) I apologized to Teri for the situation this puts her in because, like it or not, I'm the focus of all this insanity. I don't think my friends would believe his ranting for a moment, but if they have doubts, I'd be happy to forward them the e-mails and let them judge for themselves. I'd hate to think that this will cost me friendships that I've taken such a long time to build, but the cynical part of me is starting to wonder if that is his intention, like it's some sort of pay back for whatever wrong he believes I did him. I'm so sad and frustrated because I had been concerned about taking the risk to meet someone new... I'm always hessitant around new people, but I was so proud of myself for fighting my normal behavior of withdrawing (which I should have listened too this time), and followed through with keeping in contact with this man so that he would have at least one familiar face. It's going to be a long time before I extend friendship to anyone new. All I was trying to do was clarify that he was not expecting a relationship beyond friendship, but because it became very obvious that he would say one thing and do another, I realized that I didn't want anything to do with him at all.
