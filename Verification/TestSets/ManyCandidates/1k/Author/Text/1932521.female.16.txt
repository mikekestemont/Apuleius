wowwwza fer real i have just been happy lately. like theres nothing to bring a girl down, well a few, but like honestly, my life is amazing riot nio. for example, yesterday i worked with jim, and hes just really nice and i love that kid. then i could drive home cuz my parents were so thoughtful as to give me my liscence back. then me tess mart and clarr warched one of the worlds best movies : dickie roberts: former child star. and something as simple as playing a few games b4 bed just made the night complete. i went to bed happy and woke up in the night laughing b/c sarah started screaming things in her sleep waking us all up. then in the mooonin i ate pop tarts, which was a positive, but the best part was emma was doing all of her dances for us and hannah was attempting them too. it was hillarious. and then we hit shady izzoak. it just was one of the best spans of times EVER.  u know what i was thinking about tho, just to go deep for a sec. having a boyfriend or a girl friend is so WIERD. like think about it. you pour your heart aout to one person, and say all these things, and do little cute things for them like go to their games or buy them presents, or suprise them somewhere. but then like, when youre 'done' with them and move on to the next person, you do it all again, and its all the SAME. like, you end up saying that same nice things, and going to the same games, only for a differnt person. like why does it mean anything any more. or why do ppl not get offended when someone askes them out. i do. so the next time that a guy askes me out im going to start crying and ask them why they dont care about me. but seriously think about that. it makes you wonder the significance of your relationships.   gatta eat and then coach, wish my sistas team luck.  ~~monroe
k well last night was one of the funnest nights in a while. we took care of business on jenny's tramp, and we watched a few quality movies such as hollow man, memento and small portion or rats. we had one mass CO-ED sleepover which is just a positive step in a whole new direction. but the guys were just to 'with it'when we played chuck or fuck, but they're new...i guess u could say. also avital sang a few songs which were amazing, on the flip-side, she woke up the entire house at 5 in da mooonin. but honestly it was fun. next step: sleeping in the shaggin. it will happen, im calling it.   oh and david wilkinson you owe me two dollars and do not deny it. u happen to make the same bet twice and, yes, you lost so PAY UP. oh and u spelled ur own name wrong in sarahs yearbook from way back in the day. ur spelled ur name wilkonson. (poor kid) ahem...  ok, i really dont know what to say, im so conflicting. a part of me really wants to just blow up and write this nasty blog about something that happened. because i felt like i was about to throw up for about..mm..a couple hours last night. like i try to tell myself that i dont care, and its not a big deal and to move on, and like ive been trying to psyche myself out for like the past few weeks but i guess im not doing a good enough job. but like it really ISNT that big of a deal and i dont even know why im wasting ppls time writing this. i think its not that big of a deal to me until im really there caought up in it, then it means the world to me. aaah. i hafta go  im helping coach my dads soccer team baby  ttyl

well lets see. 2day i visited augsburg, played nintendo with quaile and buyas, i worked with yossi and jamie, hmm and hung out with the jew kids. it was a hot one. soo hot. want to touch..nvm. oh and CLAIRE BROKE HER PHONE. lets see. she made it about....45 minutes with that phone. i got it. lets all pitch in some money and buy her ONE of those clips (the one that attaches the mitten to your jacket sleeve) and clip one end to her phone and the other to her FACE. now that thats settled..  the shaggin last night was a GROOD...i mean great...and good... great and good... time, david did manage cover his face in wax. Typical david forgot that the candles would eventually overflow with wax, and he was lying on the floor under one of the corner-shelves and all the wax flowed off the shelf on to his face. it was a beautiful thing. oh and we did have a HARD CORE card fight, and yes i took every one with authority. especially clay. poor kid. but honestly the shaggy waggy looks emaculate, everyone should check it out, and david would like the company. it would give him something to do other then make out with his sister.   moving on  i have the thought of the blog. ok. lets say u have a friend or a l
