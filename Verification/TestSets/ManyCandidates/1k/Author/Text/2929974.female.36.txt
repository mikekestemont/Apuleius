Every year about this time I start thinking about divorcing my television. You know, the sun's up earlier and out longer and it's brighter and, well, there's that smell in the air. I sort of feel guilty about being indoors too long.   I also have a pretty hard and fast rule about no tv during daylight, even when tv and I are having our wintertime marriage. Basically, I feel like a total loser/couch potato/sloth if I find myself pulling the blinds so I can watch tv without the glare. So no tv during daylight.   But this year I sense that the divorce isn't gonna happen. See, I got this new thing, the DVR. It's like a mini-TiVo. I can digitally record shows and it holds them until I say to delete. I can fast-forward and rewind and pause live tv. I can skip the commercials with relative accuracy, nothing like the clumsy VCR. The thing looks cool too. It's all shiny and silver, with rounded edges. Feels very 21st century.   The worst thing is, I added a boatload of cable channels when I got the DVR–6 HBOs, the Sundance channel, IFC, some weird Lifetime Movie channel–but I don't watch any of that. No, what I watch are re-runs of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and The West Wing. I can watch them for hours and I don't foresee any changes to that. ever.  Because I realized that what I like about those shows are their promise of the world. Buffy exists as a world where women have the power. All of the significant changes in the world happen because the girls think of a plan, then act on it. Though I don't believe in separatism, Buffy's world where women make decisions about their own destinies is pretty attractive (even with the horrible, inert final season). As for The West Wing, well, that's an easy one. It presents an American government as it should be. Leaders are thoughtful and educated. Decisions are made by people who have good sense. There's an effort made to be bipartisan, to keep extremism at bay. And in the early seasons especially, the vision of America as an idea comes up often. This show knows how government works. And if the rest of America pays attention, they can learn a little bit about it while they're being entertained. sigh. It's all a fantasy, and I'm buying it.    So, the marriage of me and tv might get a reprieve this year. Think I can get a license, or will that be covered in the Marriage Amendment?
I don't know about you, but when I was a kid I thought there would be a magic moment when I would feel like an Adult. It was going to be like a tap on the shoulder or a blow to the head or something like that. Apparently being a grown up is more about having all the things I've held dear and true being knocked to hell by reality. I found out today that one of my heroes, a real-life person who I met and worked with when I was 20, is a sham. That's right, sham. The thing I admired about this guy was that he always presented himself as nothing but the real thing. He was the first openly gay person I'd met of either sex. He had no qualms about who he was or what he was, and he made me begin to think of myself in more honest terms because of that. He also taught me that just because we worked in the service industry didn't mean that we had to accept being treated like less-than humans. If customers were rude to him, he was rude right back. Many of us were present the night he slapped a banana peel, retrieved from the garbage can, on the table in front of the woman who insisted her banana split wasn't fresh. "How THAT for fresh?" SMACK! I loved him.  I loved him more when I discovered he wrote a nationally syndicated advice column. I exploded EXPLODED with pride when his books started appearing all over the country.  I swooned when he occasionally turned up on my favorite radio show. We weren't best friends or anything. He was just, you know, someone I knew who I looked up to when I was still in my formative years. It made me feel that buzzy combo of wonderment/awe/comfort to see that he'd made it. He wasn't a professional waiter, oh no! He "made it." Woo hoo! My brush with fame, you know? So this week I received one of my many magazines, and there was my guy, profiled and interviewed because of his awesome job. And there, in a little box, was his age. Except it was wrong. At least, I thought it was. I conferred with someone else who knew him the same way I did, and we agreed that, yes, he was surely older than us and this printed age had to be wrong. Was it a misprint, or is he perpetuating this? Why would he lie about his age, since he's always been about being honest about who he is, right? Well...... today I found out that his name, the name I know him by, the name he's had since well before his celebrity formed, the name I thought was his, is not his name at all. and I'm really disappointed. Why? Because the name he goes by sounds so much like a stage name that we asked him about it, or at least I thought we did. I'm pretty sure he insists that it's his real name. Maybe it is. Maybe it's part of his full name or something like that. But I can't help feeling the letdown. This paragon of honest living, of living your life as nothing but who you are, is a fabrication. He's a construction of someone who was born as someone else. And, yeah, maybe the name he goes by reflects something well in the past that I know nothing about. Maybe there's a
