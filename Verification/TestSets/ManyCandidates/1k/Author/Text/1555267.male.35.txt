remove it!     I finally removed the key of my totalled car from my keyring tonight.  The bulky key had been sitting on my keyring so far just because I always found that the key is far inside of the key ring whenever I tried to remove it.  In order to remove it, I had to pull out all other keys first.  But I did it tonight.  Maybe we do the same way when we have to remove something settled at the bottom of our heart.  Just remove it.....now....
Healing...     I'm in healing process..... hopefully some CDs that I brought from my music cellar (Boulder Public Library) can help this healing process.

one flight down...   I'm listening to Norah Jones' song 'one flight down' again.....  It's been a while to have a chance to listen this song but the feeling in me is.....more touching and ............  One flight down.... there's song on low... ...........
Beautiful French wedding     It IS possible to marry a dead fiance in France (  urlLink Paris Journal: A Love That Transcends Death Is Blessed by the State  ).  How lovely it is....  I want to meet one of them and ask how they feel.  I wish I can feel their emotion and warm hearts.....
Illusion....     I just hope the words, songs, and talks that I had with beautiful-minded friend were not an illusion.  It'll be really hard to admit that a warm feeling settled for a while in my heart was another illusion.....  Just hope that the sun doesn't rise so the images on the window doesn't go away.....
time to say goodbye...     My Golf was totalled because of the accident happened last week.  It was quite unlucky to have theose airbags deployed.  I've got some comments from the vw.watercooled news group that some of the older VW models have quite sensitive airbag sensors.  I partly agree because the speed was quite slow.  The estimated cost for the airbags exceed the total value of my car so it's the time to say goodbye to this poor guy.  I also started a thread at the same group that asking "Am I doing right?".  Some says it's quite understandable for older vehicles but some says why don't I forget about the airbags and secure the seat belt instead.  No..no....I need airbags....  You can read a series of postings under my question on "rec.autos.makers.vw.watercooled", with a title "time to say goodbye to my A3"

PHOTO FRIDAY Challenge....neglected     In the morning....the toys left and neglected on the playground greets me.
Blue Sky.....   I don't think I can look up the blue sky for a while....hopefully just for a while....  I feel like that the sky that I see today is just like the sky of Pink Floyd....
trying to back to normal...     I'm having hard time to get back to normal.  And also trying to take some 'not-boring' pictures but neither of them works fine so far.  I finally took this picture of street light this morning.  I've long been thinking about taking a picture of this light ....so, instead of torture me to take new stuff, I just decided to make myself get used to the past thoughts first.....
done...   Yes, I just gave the preseantion at the conference this aftertnoon.  It's been quite busy days so far but I'm trying to finish the rest of the days smoothly......if I can...
finally     It's the first day of my conference visit to Seoul.  Because of the time constraint and the lack of softwares in the unfamilar machine that I have to use during the week, the pictures will be posted here without any fancy frame editing :) However, I'm quite tired after the 14hrs of flight... still alive thouhg.....  ......Mar.21 morning (local time) update..... I got Gimp this morning so, now I can edit the picutres just like before... yipee!!!
Alone or together
Got ready?   I'm trying to get ready for the conference in Seoul, Korea.  Now I have my presentation file sent to the conference organization so there's nothing left to do with the conference itself.  I just need to be familiar with my presentation :) and on board early Friday morning.  But....I still have lots of stuffs in my hand....about the journal paper, several model re-run, and the next step of the research....gee....  I'm planning to have my Dimage Xt during my trip so hopefully I can post some of nice pictures from Korea.
Blue Sky     This is for a friend who missed the blue sky yesterday.  During I put this picture in the frame, a song from Pink Floyd just came to my mind.... a sad song that a part of their legendary album 'Wall'.  It starts with 'good bye...blue sky...good bye....'.  I don't know why I feel so sad when I look up the sky these days....  Oh, I just changed the size of the picture frame.  Now it is 307 by 410, vice versa.
Perfect cure for cold...     Yes, this could be the perfect cure for cold.....Tylenol Day & Night plus Ricola.....gee.....  What should we take when we caught a cold for our mind?
PHOTO FRIDAY Challenge....clean     Legally clean....
Flying high     Colorado....is one of the place that has most 'sunny day' around the world.  Actually, over 300 days a year are shiny.  As usual, a high flying plane left a beautiful scene with the sunset.  I wish I could fly like that.......
Set them free.....
