urlLink Rice-A-Roni/Pasta Roni - Products - Rice-A-Roni - Beef   I know this is petty but it's my blog and i'll whine if I want to.  I've been an off again/on again addict of beef flavored Rice a Roni for the better part of 20 years now.  Upon the initial stages of my addiction, the product used to come in a can. Along the lines of a can of crisco. It was my everything, i'd eat that nonstop for months on end, then the problem. I'm a pretty wacked kinda person.  I only started eating steak about 15 years ago, I grew up on hot dogs and hamburgers and pizza. Now at age 36, I haven't progressed much in the food department.  I still eat like a 15 year old boy. I won't eat onions, I can't eat salads, pretty much if its good for me I can't eat it.  I wish I wasn't like that but thats me. Now I was extremely happy when I discovered that I like rice a roni, it was a food that I for years thought of as "not for me kinda food."  In or around the year of 1992, rice a roni started to add carrot chunks to the beef broth and from there my love affair with rice a roni has gone downhill from a strong love to a weak lust.   I have to use a strainer to strain the broth and collect the carrots before I can cook it to eat. I've written to the company to ask if they could stop adding the carrots.  I even went so far as to write a letter lying to them that my sick grandmother could only eat beef rice a roni but she's allergic to carrots in hope they would perhaps send me a stockpile of rice they might have had piled up in a warehouse.  Of course they sent me a note saying due to the demand for the carrots they could not help me. Ahh well.. Sometimes it sucks being me, I almost feel like i'm stuck between a normal reality and a childlike reality that is within my head. Someday maybe i'll act my age and feel my age, but until then i'll continue in my non conventional ways and strain the veggies from my rice. I'll write more as my life happens..

Not much has gone on lately.&nbsp;&nbsp; Past few days have been pretty uneventful other than going to Maggianos again for more spaghetti (I love that damn place) . I've been back at work now for maybe 3 or 4 days now, even though i'm on light duty things seem to be going pretty smooth. I've been pretty mellow lately, even though my time off wasn't and should not be considered "vacation" by any means, i'm noticing at work i'm not at my normal 160% stress level, (i'd say maybe 40% or so right now ;) ) Hell I was stopped tonight at a 7-11 by a homeless guy and I actually stopped and gave him about 80 cent's or so and when I was in line buying a vanilla coke and a snickers bar for me, I bought an extra snickers and gave it to him, I know its not much but i'm sure food in any form is appreciated.  Well it's time to give 1 of my 2 beautiful shelties some medicine which I need to wrap up in cheese. To bad I don't have a cam set up here, I have to sit on the floor and wrap her pill up in cheese, and then my other little girl sits next to me wanting some cheese, and as of last night my cat now sits in the medicianal pow wow and wants cheese. Sometimes I feel more like the puppet than the puppetteer with my little four legged bullies. More to come as life happens..
