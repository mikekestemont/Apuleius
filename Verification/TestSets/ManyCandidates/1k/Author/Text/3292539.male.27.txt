This is the coolest thing!  I just figured out how to get the blogger shortcut on my google toolbar!  Now I can blog at the touch of a button!  O' the joys of technology!
Well it was Brents going away bash this past weekend!  It was great fun!  The padres kicked in for food and beer...they got not only 1 keg of the glorious C-, but 2!!  It was awesome!  And you would think that 2 kegs would be too much, but not for this group of partiers!  We pretty much finished both!  I couldn't believe it!  And I have to say that Jay and I kicked ass at Beirut!  We were the first team to take Brent and Matt to sudden death overtime!  O' yeah baby!  We didn't quite get the big W, but we gave them a run for their money!  The night came to a close with, of course.....the hot tub!  Its amazing how we always end up in th hot tub at 3 in the morning and why we think that is normal, I don't know! LOL!   The next morning we were all feeling pretty chipper.  I think we attributed that to the second round of sausage that the grill master cooked up at 2 in the morning!  Thanks Cory!   Well now Brent is off to Sea for 4 months, and he will be missed but it was great that we got to send him off with a bash!
Well I think its time to go home.  Im still at work, which sucks ass.  I bought LOTR:Return of the King today and I want to go home and watch it.  This week is pretty much going to suck I think.  Im looking forward to the weekend though!  We are going to have a bar-b-que at our casa on Sunday.  Everyone is invited!    On to some good news.  Brian told us today that we should never work both days on a weekend from here on out.  That was pretty comforting to hear after having to work a couple weekends both days.  He also said that he would not ask anyone to come in and work on Memorial Day weekend.  But of course that is a load of crap, we have to come in for at least one day.  Im going to just work Saturday and get it out of the way so I have the rest of the weekend free!  Well I've been here long enough, it time to head home!  See ya all on Sunday hopefully!
urlLink    See, now this guy has a good job.
Did I mention that work sucks?  Just in case I did'nt.........work sucks.
So i rode my hog, a la GT I-Drive style, on over to the old Mackay house to see what the fellers were up to. Lundberg had the THQ MX Unleashed game for XBox - so sick. Maybe honey pants would like an Xbox for her birthday!? The graphics and the sounds effects escpecially of the monster truck were awesome. Reminds me of riding my two stroke dirt bike in the hills of hungry valley, speaking of which we should plan a date for the peeps to go rent some dirt bikes and create a little havic!
Well, E3 is over and it was awesome.  It seemed to come and go so fast.  I got to see all my friends from back up in the bay area.  We basicly got drunk every night and then went to the Sony party and saw Black Eyed Peas, Missy Elliot and The Crysal Method.  All in all, I would say a great E3!  As far as going back to work goes....it sucks.  We are crazy busy around here and look to stay that way for a while.  We get a break somewhere towards the middle of July, but other then that we are crammed.  This is really putting a stress on all of my Summer plans!  Hopefully I can work though it though.  Jay is back in town and we hung out with her and the peeps this weekend down in the RB.  It was sweet.  Got drunk on Saturday out at the pier at this new place called Underground.  It was actully a pretty cool place, and I think I will be going back there for sure.  After that we hit up the beach on Sunday and chilled all afternoon to wind down.  Im not sure what the etiqutte is on how long these blog posts are supposed to be so im going to cut it short...until next time...
Ok so I have checked out the Redondo police report and the Beach Reporter crime watch report and no such arrest of an irate man that was rear-ended and arrested on Saturday, May 8.....This is not complete proof that it did not happen.....But I am smelling a big hunk of bullshit!  If Cory can actually find an arrest record I might be convinced, but otherwise the smell continues to permeate!
All I have to say is that I   HATE   Windows XP!  My employer (and IT department whom I've spoken with about 30 times over the past 3 days) for some reason thinks that this "operating platform" is God's gift or something.  I hate to break it to them but... IT SUCKS ROYALLY!  I can't do anything in it.  And the best thing is that the software I use to actually DO my job doesn't run on this freaking system.  What is up with that?
So we have plans to go to the beach on Saturday afternoon with the infamous k-dog...I am thinking.....he is really making efforts to redeem himself..this is a good thing.  Its 2pm and Cory has talked to him at least 4 times that day working out the details.  Cory and I get to Hermosa, hanging out eating sandos and waiting for K to show up with the beer. Cory really wants a beer so the minutes are like hours...lol...So K calls and says he has to pick up ice, and then he will be there....well another hour goes by and no beer!!  We have been there for two m
