About a month ago, a friend of mine named Lauren was beaten by this guy friend of hers.  I had felt a rage inside of me that I had not felt in ages.  I was going to kill him in the slowest, most torturous fashion I could think of with whatever instruments I could think of (hatchet, staple gun, etc.).  Unfortunately, Lauren did not want me to do anything to him because she didn't want me to go to jail.  She also said that if I retaliated, this guy would feel vindicated in what he did in the first place.  But because I care so much about this girl, my anger would not be so easily sated.  I decided to write a poem about what I was going to do to him.  This is for you, Austin O'Malley:  SAFE  You think you're a man You think you know what a man is Oh yeah, you're a big man You scared her to death With your hand around her neck Oh, what a great big man you are You punched her in the face And busted her lip Yeah, you showed her who's in charge But there's just one thing That I want you to know Just who in the fuck are you?  So tell me now How did it feel? To feel her life wilting in your grasp It's so unlike any power That you've ever known You could kill her anytime you want  Are you proud of yourself Did you run off and gloat 'Cause you showed her you were the boss But as big of a man As you think you are There's always someone bigger  I've never pretended to be a saint I've been a sinner my whole life And there's one more sin inside of me Me and you and this knife  Tell me how brave you were When you had taken total control Don't tell me I don't want to do this I've already sold my soul  There's nothing left for me to save Given it up to make you pay How do you want it, standing up Or on your knees so you can pray  No God can save you now You've sealed your own fate I don't want to hear you're sorry I'm afraid it's much too late I know you wish you could take it back That's something I wish too But since we can't go in the past I guess this will have to do Do you know how fear tastes? I bet somehow it's not as sweet But to see your blood running down you neck Now that's a tasty treat  I know I probably won't get away with it Who says that's even a concern All that matters is that I take my time So you get what you deserve I know you're probably wondering What business is this of mine Let's just say that when it comes to her I've never met someone so kind  That's something I don't understand What could she have done to make you put your hands On her neck and squeeze And make her say pretty please  Let's get something straight I don't want to hear your side I've had enough of this little chat Now it's time for you to die  I know she probably didn't want me to kill But hindsight sees things too late I've nothing to throw away My whole life has been a waste At least my heart was in the right place I only wanted her to be safe
Women.  An age old quandary, to be sure.  The only thing I know is that I know jack and crap about them.  The beginning of any relationship is a poker match that never fails to frustrate at least one of the players.  It's no surprise that most marriages don't last.  Imagine having to deal with this bullshit 24/fucking/7. On second thought, don't.  You'll get an aneurysm.  Which, if you're married, you are probably wishing for one right about now.
