These pics are from a bike ride to the north of Yonezawa. I was guided around by Andrew (a 2nd year ALT also stationed in Yonezawa), and we spent most of the time following the main river out of the city. I spent much more time biking than taking photos, so there isn't much to show unfortunately. Should be exciting for river fetishists though.   urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink
Here are a couple of shots from a Buddhist temple on the outskirts of Yonezawa. Apologies for the blurriness of the bottom-right photo (up until this point, I hadn't been using the focus properly on the digital camera). Idiot proof? Not bloody likely.   urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink
These photos were taken during my commute to Yonezawa, from Tokyo. I quickly learned that I would have to keep my camera at the ready, otherwise the shinkansens (bullet trains) would vanish out of sight.  There were a couple of varieties of shinkansen that went by while we were there. The two most interesting ones were the ultrasleek stupidly high speed variant (not pictured), and the double-decker version (*sigh* - also not pictured). I did manage to get photos of the type that I travelled in though (hooray!).   urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink

After an 11 hour flight to Narita Airport with 50 or so other JETs, I was shuttled to the Keio Plaza hotel in the Shinjuku district of Tokyo (the bus that took us there was a Mitsubishi 'Powertard' *giggle*). A bunch of orientation seminars took place in the hotel, in an effort to better prepare us for our work and living in Japan. During the orientation there I met up with a ton of different people from around the world and went on random excursions into the city.  Although I only visited two areas of Tokyo (Shijuku and Shibuya), the experience was almost overwhelming. Video screens the size of buildings were common in many areas of Shibuya, spouting advertising for J-Pop, movies, and personal hygiene products. Neon signage crept up to the sky, and all around there was an insane amount of activity. It is however kinda scary how quickly the city changes from cool exciting techno land, to unsettling dodgy porno land without much notice. Although the streets were well populated with people going about their business, there were guys handing out porno fliers every 30 paces or so. Strangely they were all black dudes, and seemed to target foreigners exclusively. Saying 'no thankyou' didn't seem to do the trick so I would instead mention that I was a 'good Christian' and that seemed to ward them off (apologies to the good Christian's out there).  Among other things, I checked out several electronics stores, including Yodobashi. The particular Yodobashi store that I went into in Shinjuku was a 9-story building selling nothing but electronics. There was some really really cool stuff there, but I restricted myself to the purchase of a digital camera. The camera is a pretty swish Canon limited edition 5MP unit. I bought it on my last day in Tokyo so unfortunately I only had a limited opportunity to snap off some shots. I took some from the hotel, looking out of the sprawling metropolis that is Tokyo, and got some of the Shinjuku station and the Shinkansen platform (where bullet trains arrive and depart). Unlike pretty much every other place in the world, the trains here run exactly on time. I was told I would be arriving in Yonezawa at 2:47, and I arrived there at 2:47 on the dot.  The bullet train I took was one of the slower types, but we were still racing along (at a guestimated 150-200kph). The seats on the train were kind of interesting because you could swivel them around through 180 degrees at any time so that you could face the people sitting behind you. It made for a rather intimate seating arrangement (especially for anyone larger than your standard Japanese businessman), but it was really cool.  Upon arrival in Yonezawa city (my new home for the next year or so), I was met at the station by my Supervisor (Kanomata-sensei) and Andrew Clare - a British JET in his 2nd year of the programme, and a really cool guy. They were both dressed down somewhat more than me in my full suit, and with good reason: the ambient temperature was around 34 degrees. The high humidity made things even more uncomfortable as the air was so saturated with moisture that sweat couldn't evaporate.  We high-tailed it to the office in Kanomata-sensei's car, where I met with the entire office and gave my self introduction in Japanese a couple of times. The people were really nice and friendly, doing a cool job of laying out the welcome mat. I filled out a bunch of forms with a little bit of Andrew's help (he reads and speaks Japanese well), and we were given the rest of the day off to look around the city. Yonezawa isn't an enormous city by any means, so bikes are very popular as a mode of transport. I feel somewhat lucky as I have one of the only mountain bikes in the area, whilst 99% of the population ride granny bikes.  An interesting difference between NZ and Japan is that cars are considered to be at the top of the food chain. Next are cyclists, then the lowly pedestrian. This means that unless you are in a car, you best have your wits about you. Another thing is that bikes are allowed on the footpath as well as the side of the road, which is fun if you're on a bike, and less fun if you're on foot.  At the end of my first day, Andrew took me to a 'beer garden' where they have an all you can eat and drink offer for two hours. He was noticed by some of the Japanese dudes there and we were invited to j
