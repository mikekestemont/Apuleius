There's so many songs about saying goodbye, leaving, missing you.. its pathetic really. Honestly, these people should just move on with their lives. But who am I to talk, its a week, a funking week..168 hours :| feeling very much like a dork.  And Im contemplating whether or not I should go to Jillians party.. but its 9:00[ish] already and Id have to walk both ways. So Im thinking no... but Im sure theyre all having lots of fun without me. I kinda feel like being alone anyway.  And I miss Lydia. I think Im going to kidnap her and take her hostage for a while so that she cant leave, because I honestly havent done anything outside of school with her for too long. wayy too long. And since Operation HPB is well under way, I think Ill make a new one.. Operation Steal-Lydia-so-she-cant-leave-anymore. Anyone want in?   Listening To: Battle of Who Could Care Less- Ben Folds  [ahh Lauren I just did it again!!!]   Do you not hear me anymore I know it's cool to be so bored I know it's not your thing to care But it sucks me in when you're aloof It sucks me in, it sucks it works I guess it's cool to be alone Will you never rest Fighting the battle of who  Could care less Everyday you wake up late Sometimes I wish I was that way   My guitar is calling, as is my front porch. I think that chocolate upstairs is too. Night
I actually woke up early for work so I have a couple of minutes to post before I go.. Well lets see whats the line up for today.. working, then to band practice with lauren :D possibly hopefully something with behn, and then go to bed early because I am dead tired. "and I look like shit without my makeup on... didnt I? you can say it, I looked like shit! Because I did.."  hahahha. I wont explain that one. Anyway so today will be the last day that I see behn for a week [and a day].. I know its not actually that long but we're really used to seeing each other, well, almost everyday. So itll be weird.. and Ill miss him, but its not that long right?.. right?   I wish Tyler was here to give me the old "when I was going out with [insert random girl name here], we only saw each other twice a month because she went to a different school than I did, its only a week and youd better not get all mopey because I will come and kick your ASS." talk. haha tyler I miss you, in a cousinly sort of way.  Well Behn if your reading this, if you ever get near to a computer when your gone, you can always come here to my blog and read about how much I miss you.. or Ill probably end up writing you sappy letters that start with "Dearest Behn..."  ...Ill try not to though. Man Im weird.
well lets see, whats new today.. Im still rocking as much as I was yesterday, and I believe Operation HPB is going smoothly [Im such a loser.] Anyway today was an amazing day.. the whole morning/afternoon in school went by quickly, I did swicked on my Ancient History test, gym class was excellent [sub+hot hot heat], and I basically spent the remainder of the day with Behn. Did I ever mention that Im lucky as hell, because I am. And I know it, so dont go saying Im not thankful. Because I am, very.  Anyway so I just walked behn halfway home and we kind of had our long goodbye today since hes going away on his band trip next week, and we may or may not see each other tomarrow [hopefully yes]. Hes leaving sunday am  very  early and coming home next sunday, again with the earliness. Anyway I have to work tomarrow so Ill post again in the near future..   Lydia I guess your gone already :S but if you get this I miss you terribly. I never see you anymore and it sucks. I think its past time we got together over icecream :D  Lauren Ill call you when I get home from work about practice! you too Behn :)
did I mention that I fucking rule? Lauren you owe me one.. Cory I love you.. Im awesome. Band practice saturday afternoon here we come!  Anyway what a great night, a whole lot better than last but whatever. Im so excited about this whole thing and yes, Im a huge dork. thats just me, so youll have to accept it.. or you could always just stop reading. Its all up to you. Im not sure if tomarrow will be quite such an eventful day but hopefully it will be. Gym tomarrow Lauren, whoop! Tyler if your reading this, you should write more in your blog because it makes me laugh. I love it.  Plus Im wearing my band sweater tomarrow.. it is so comfy, you dont understand, unless you have one of your own of course. If you come up to me asking about the fuzziness of it, I will understand completely and let you feel it.. mmm fuzzy. It would have been so much better if we got black sweaters with white writing.. classy. but meh, they rock anyway. Way to conform morgan..
another great day.. life is wonderful. Actually, if I wasnt me, Id be annoyed as hell at me, because Im being so happy and such. So if you dont like me being this happy maybe you should stop reading, because morgans emo days are over! [for now]  Anyway, we got our band sweaters today! Im not usually one for school spirit or anything but I used to wear my brothers everyday, and you all know how crappy and beat up it got. It was my favourite sweater, and then my mom threw it out [this she denies but I know the truth.] But all that is over and done with b
