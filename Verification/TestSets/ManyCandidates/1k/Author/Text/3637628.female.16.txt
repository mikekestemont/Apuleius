Ahoy there fellow mateys!!  Yesterday consisted of many new entries to the annals of funny things.  Man, i need to think of a better name for those damn annals.  Anyway, i went to kerry's party, which was in freakin nowheresville, but it was worth it because i love her.  The place was great,  a lake for swimmin' and boatin' and lookin-for-snakes-n'.  There were numerous couches and tables for talking and playing cards, an indoor volleyball court, thousands of dollars worth of musical equipment,  and fooseball/airhockey/pingpong/pool tables as far as the eye can see.  There was an equally cool field for frizbeing, which we did a great deal of.  The highlight of the evening was the frisbee playing.  We had way too many people to play without confusion, but it was the crazed atmosphere that made it fun.  Jimmy and Chris Bopp were in a constant struggle.  Stacy was trying to pump her team up, until she gave up and joined chrissie on the sidelines.  Danielle managed to kick ass and dance at the same time.  Alex almost got sexually harrassed by a group of burly guys, and Moira almost got sexually harrassed by one VERY CREEPY burly guy (look on the bright side sunshine... *shiver*).  Me and Jackie played a lot of not-running-but-still-trying defense, and Bowyer kept messing with us and calling us out.    Oh, by the way, i decked bowyer  hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha  There was a bonfire and lots of good times, and if i'm forgetting anything about the party, please leave a comment and tell me, it was really late when i got home and it's really late now, so i don't remember a whole lot.  Anyway, on the car ride home... i swear those s'mores were drugged...  Chrissie's dad was driving us home and somehow the conversation turned to 'fookies', a mysterious combination of ferrets and cookies.  Then i fell asleep with dirty, dirty feet from frisbee.  I'll leave you with a final deep thought  After you dip your dead ferrets in melted chocolate, roll them in cookies quickly, because that chocolate dries fast!!  Jess
So here's the story morning glory:  I had a really stupid fight with my mom, that normally would have gotten me zero punishment, but since we were off to a high stress day at grandpops, and my mom was going 'mad' i was grounded.  Don't be so alarmed, it was originally two weeks, then one week, then the weekend.   Anyway, theres a lot of ground to cover.  As we were leaving school on thursday, me and alex managed to finagle TWELVE history books.  It was really funny to see a group of us each carrying one or two books around.  Just thought i should throw that out there.  On thursday, the last day of school, what do me and my dorky friends do?  Go to a bookstore.  Get this!  At said bookstore, we all decided we liked books so much that we would start a BOOK CLUB!!  Yeah, we're cool.  After the bookstore, we thoroughly destroyed Chrissies house.  After a rousing game of apples to apples (Awkward!)  we played a less rousing game of finish line.    P.s.  each paragraph is so short so that i get through the whole day, and so that you read all of them.  Later that night was graduation.  I didn't go, being in sucky mc suck suck choir, but my homies in womens choir  did.  Holla to the graduating class and mis amigos con hermanos y hermanas en el clase de graduacion.    At like seven forty five, as the storm of the century approacheth, i headed to alex's house.  Once people started showing up, it was really awesome.  We played a little cranium, played a little poker, and the boys showed us the darker side of the little mermaid.  All in all, a fairly fun evening.    Afterwards, we retired to moira's house as the boys settled in for a long night of losing money.  We watched pretty woman (which we borrowed from alex's house!) and promptly fell asleep after thirty seconds.  I wake up a lot in the night when i'm sleeping on a couch or the floor, and i'm usually freaked out by that.  But at moira's, everytime i woke up, there was an adorable dog at my feet!  In the morning, Mrs. Davies made us a rockin breakFEAST, and her little brother, the ninja, killed his friend in the garage.    I have been sticking to the bare bones this whole time, and i still have three days to cover?  crap.  Onfridaymeandmymomgotinthataforementionedfight,thenwedrovedowntograndpopstopaintchristinasbedroom.  Whoah, thats not gonna work.  Anyway, we sanded, caulked, and spackled our brains out.  I should really go into some background on this, or you won't understand the level of work involved.  The room at grandpops house that christina will be staying in didn't have what we call 'walls' before.  It had a form of blockage from the outside elements, but there were so many cracks and holes, that they didn't really constitute walls.  Don't even get me started on the closet.  I just wanna say that fifteen seconds in the closet would kill me.  Anyway, it took the entire day just to clean, spackle, sand, and caulk.  On saturday, Christina and Mama went back to wash the walls to get ready for paint.  If You think that would be a small job, you've never been to grandpops.    Sunday we painted, the fathers in our life stayed in the living room and watched tv while me, mama, christina, robbie, and eric painted painted painted.  Daniel played on christina's newly set up computer.  Ahh, i thinks thats everything.  I will post more later  Jess.  P.s.  IT IS NOW POSSIBLE TO POST COMMENTS
