Life is a precious gift. Hold on and celebrate life. I was just thinking about how quickly life can end.  How life changes with just one call. "Mykal? Chris. Drew's dead. Fell asleep...I'm at the hospital...can you come?" "I'm on my way."  Just last week I had dinner with Chris and his partner, Drew. They have been together for 8 years. Yet, as of last night, Drew is no longer here - he fell asleep at the wheel, crashed into the highway divider, and was killed instantly. Only a mile from home! Hasn't it been said that many of these "falling asleep" accidents occur within three miles of one's home?  So, today is a day of memories, tears, anger, consolation, and sorrow.  Please keep Chris in your thoughts and prayers.  Peace!   Drew M 1968 - 2004 Requiescat in Pace
Just another James Baldwin quote: "I imagine one of the reasons people cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they sense, once hate is gone, they will be forced to deal with pain."
Have you ever had one of those days when the world around you doesn't seem real? That things are not quite what they seem? And that you suddenly have more clarity than ever before? Well, today has been of those days for me.  When I woke up this morning, I had a strange feeling (no, it wasn't Colm doing something naughty, hehe). I couldn't quite put my finger on it; then it hit me! I felt safe and secure. What an awesome feeling! I thought about where I was personally in January of this year: things were good, but I was alone. Then, March happened - meeting Colm, starting a new relationship with him, and eventually making one of the more difficult decisions for a couple - moving in together. When I picked Colm up from the airport last Friday  my heart was singing, my pulse racing - this was it, ready, steady, go! The unreality of things, you may ask? Maybe not so much unreal, but surreal - life passing by, being connected, yet not; loving, and being loved. I sometimes think that I will wake from my dream state...but Colm assures me that this not a dream. He is a great man, and I love him with all my being.  Clarity attained? As I have as one of my favourite quotes by James Baldwin (an author that, as of May 2004, I did not know): "Love him and let him love you. Do you think anything else under heaven really matters?" This is my life. Thanks for your being a part of it!  Peace!
Summer has finally hit us! Heat and a rise in humidity are signs that our summer is here. Living at the beach does have its advantages, though.  Colm has begun his new job and is adjusting well. I am so happy that he is here and that we are together. I love waking up with my man next to me  .  Hope everyone has a great day!  Peace!
Day three of a new chapter in my life.  St Patrick's Day 2004 - a day that will live in infamy!  Amazing how life unfolds. I met him at a friend's party on that day. His name was Colm - straight (more like gay) from Dublin! From the first moment we shook hands, I felt a new type of warmth flow through me. No, it wasn't pure lust, it was something much deeper. We enjoyed the party, and then said good night. The next day, while working on the network, I received a phone call from, yes, you guessed it, COLM! He wanted to thank me for last night and that he wanted to have dinner. And the rest, they say, is history!  And now, we have begun our new life together. He has moved in with me and we are enjoying each other immensely. Life is awesomely amazing!  Peace!
It's good to be home!  LAX arrival @ 2:20a PST on Friday, 23 July 2004: man, is that late (or early, depending on one's perspective, I guess)!  Anyway, at home, to sleep in my own bed again.  Peace!
Well, here I sit, waiting....still!  Now the plane is not scheduled to depart until 12:30a CST. Talk about an interesting adventure. I haven't seen the movie  The Terminal , yet, but I think I may, by the end of this trip, be a little like the main character who lives in an airline terminal!  Anyway, here I sit, waiting...still! No worries though - it's all good.  Peace!
Well, here I sit,  - waiting! Airports are such adventures. My flight to Dallas-Fort Worth went off without a hitch. However, trying to get back to LA from DFW: a different experience altogether. No worries, though.  Flew into one terminal, told that my connection was in another terminal. Took the TrAAin (AA-DFW’s transportation system) to the next terminal. Flight delay! Okay, no worries, right at that gate was one of those “Aqua-Massagers”, so I thought, “Hey, why not kill some time?” 15 minutes later, relaxed and refreshed, I look at the monitor – time change for flight and also terminal/gate change, again. So, off I go to my next destination. And now, here I sit, waiting!  I am still on a high from my Toronto holiday and also visiting with friends in Cleveland. Now, am I ready to face the challenge of work next week?  Peace!
Well, I just got back from holiday in Toronto. What a great city - wonderful things to see, lots to do.  This was my first time in the city and I didn't know where to start.  Looked at the map book and decided that a walk up Yonge would be a great place to start. What energy in the city! I walked up to Bloor then over to Church and down through the most "colorful" neighborhood. I enjoyed a drink at Woody's and imagined the cast from  Queer as Folk  walking in.  On Sunday and Monday did the same walk and saw a few of my "favourite things" - boys f
