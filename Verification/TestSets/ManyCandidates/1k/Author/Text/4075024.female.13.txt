Hey gurl,         what r u talking about it just being your luck? N*E*way it'll probably just be my luck that i won't get to stay the night out there, b-cuz my mom has been home for about 30 min. and mark still hasn't brought it up yet you know. And i got in trouble 4 not doing my laundry,b-cuz i was going 2 be nice and let my sister finish theirs before i did mine. i would call, but i don't want to get into anymore trouble, even though i wouldn't kno why i would be getting in trouble b-cuz its not like i'm grounded from the phone or ne thing i am just waiting for them to make up their mind and i don't want to do anything else to make them want to so no, yah kno? Well ne wayz i am just sorta rambling on now so i guess i'll publish this post now!! Buh Bye     I     ♥     Matthew     &amp;     Kevin!!!!

Hey PeRsOn...      I can't believe that you waited so long to tell me about M.W.!!! N*E*wayz what is 'his' email address  .?.?.?. j/w Today was awesome, despite the fact the Mrs. Krauskopf tried to screw it up by, sending me to the office,   if yah kno what i mean.!.!. Oh yeah, I can't believe that Shawn is like that!!   But, i am not going to think ne thing bad of him until, i make sure all of the facts are straight, so yeah... Ne wayz i'll c yah l8terz.!.      I     ♥     Matthew     *&amp;*     Kevin!!!!       -  A s h l e y
he  y ashley....it was supposed to be a hint...DUH!!!! wh are you acting stupid about everything all of a sudden???? it is kinda reminding me of samantha...and that is not a good thing..... yeha i hink taylor likes him and in fact i am pretty sure cuz i asked her.....i think they are going to go out by the end of next week..and i will bet on it if i have too...but i wont just in case i do have too....i went to walmart at like 9 to like 10:30....yeah and when we came back guess who was here????   matthew does like courtney but then he says not really because of what she acts like and stuff like that but i have no clue what is going on in his head but you never know if he likes you or not....  KEITH and uncle ronnie no other kids just him and uncle ronnie which i think is sooooo ironic....but that is me....and if you read my other blog thing then i think it says something about you and samantha...and matthew...but yeah i    guess i have nuthin important to say.....i have no idea what i did...i also have no idea what the heck i am talking about....but yeah i guess see ya...   ~*bYe*~ for now.....
Hey Kirstin,        What is up with the *hint,hint* thing with Kevin? Is it supposed to tell me sumthin'.?.?.?.  I think Matthew likes Courtney again.  I don't know about the Shawn thingy,   but i am gonna ask Taylor if she likes him tomorrow, kay.!. Oh yeah I think i know who Samantha likes, but i don't   want to put it on h
