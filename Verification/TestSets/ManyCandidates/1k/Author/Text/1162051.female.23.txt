the plan was......  to apply.  i went to the bookstore and bought John Douglas's  urlLink Guide to Police Officer Exams .    Douglas's book went over salary expectations, departmental obstacles, goals, and juristidictions, how a police department is organized, and what to expect on the written exam, physical exam, interview, background investigation, psychological evaluation, and polygraph.    i started my search over the internet.  how much are police officers making these day?  what areas did i want to apply to?  what do i have to do?  did i meet the criteria?    for the majority of police departments, the minimal educational requirement is a high school diploma or the equivalent, a GED.  the age requirement is usually somewhere between 20-21 years of age.  the police population is male dominated, but the female population is on the rise, and no, females are not given special treatment when it comes to the physical agilities test (which in my opinion, is good).    a good traffic record and a lack of drug history and bizarre sexual history is GOOD.  the opposite + a criminal history = bad.  of course, should you have a drug history, telling the truth is the most important, and as long as it isn't a part of your current lifestyle, you're okay.  some departments require that you be clean for atleast X amount of years before applying to become a police recruit.  sometimes they even specify which drug and the years which you must be clean varies.  some departments just care if you come clean and admit, "yes yes, i did it once, and yes, i did inhale."
the purpose of this blog is to create some kind of ... well, blog recording the little hurdles i've had to jump in order to become an officer of law enforcement.  (which i have yet still to become.  yes, the title is premature.)  besides, it's the journey that matters most, right?  well, in this case, certainly it does matter, but the end-result matters too.  in fact, all of it matters, when you think about it, so for certain it would be a good idea to record.  anyhow.....  my name is van.  and i am in the process becoming a police officer.  (*fingers crossed*)  it all started with me wanting to be "in the field."  i was a disgruntled "professional" working in office space hell at the university of penis (er...phoenix) and i started to realize asking the question, "what the hell am i doing here?" became pretty routine.  somehow i had fallen off the track i had started.......  which somehow always involved law enforcement.  so i gathered some mental energy, quit my job, and started planning.
been awhile since i real post.&nbsp; apologies.&nbsp; i've been a little antisocial since my parents have gone to toronto.&nbsp; they come back saturday so i'm looking forward to having them home again.&nbsp; meanwhile i've been here in my own head, burying myself in my drawings, working, and cleaning up the house.&nbsp; it's been nice and quiet, but i'll admit, a little lonely.&nbsp;   luckily for me, i have a good cell phone plan ;).  i've been pumping a lot of iron too and i'm starting to see a huge difference in my upper body.&nbsp; it's kind of cool!&nbsp; (heh, i'm obsessed.)  i want to get into boxing and walked into a boxing gym today but it costs a fortune to join.&nbsp; the salesman was trying to convince me to dish out $400 for a year membership.&nbsp; he's crazy!&nbsp;   still no word from SDPD which is making me anxious at night and keeping me from going to sleep at a good hour (yeah, it's like 3am right now, UGH.).&nbsp; i keep wondering and wondering and wondering.&nbsp; it is torturous.&nbsp; i need to learn patience.  i left a voicemail today.&nbsp; hopefully i will get a call back.&nbsp; still no news from references that they've been contacted, so what the heck is going on?!!!  no decline letters yet either.&nbsp; heh.  i've been looking at east coast departments - baltimore, va state police, philadelphia.&nbsp; some of them have pretty challenging physicals, which excites me.&nbsp; looks like i'll have to figure out the 10 second dummy drag afterall.  for the next few weeks i envision close to what i've been doing these past two weeks - working a whole lot, saving money, waiting for SDPD stuff, and drawing nearly everyday on my graphic novel.&nbsp; i'll elaborate further on it later when things start to materialize a little more.  anyway, MUST collapse.&nbsp; God bless, everyone.

urlLink    street art, downtown san francisco.&nbsp; urlLink     &nbsp; still no word from SDPD.&nbsp; it's been exactly two weeks since my polygraph/interview in San Diego.&nbsp; millions of questions in my head:&nbsp; did someone go on vacation?&nbsp; are they about to start calling my references, friends, professors, and old roommates?&nbsp; am i in the "DQ" pile and they just haven't yet typed up the letter of rejection to send me?&nbsp; are they in the process of scheduling my oral board?&nbsp; are they comparing me to other candidates right now, and i'm neck-in-neck with another person, and they're looking over how i committed petty (very petty) theft in my past, and is thinking i have a capacity for corruption?  paranoia, anxiety, FEAR.  besides that, i've been a little creative today.&nbsp; i'm in the middle of drawing a graphic ad about drugs.&nbsp; i'm t
