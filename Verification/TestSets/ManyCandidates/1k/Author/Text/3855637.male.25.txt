Well this thing keeps going, and unfortunately for the Democratic Convention, the most exciting part so far has been the Bill O’Reilly/Michael Moore Debate.&nbsp; And even that was a flop.&nbsp; O’Reilly didn’t keep Moore on track, and O’Reilly wasn’t as “pithy” as usual.&nbsp; Moore kept pressing home that question of, “Would you send your children to Iraq to fight against a dictator?”&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The answer to that question is a simple no.&nbsp; I mean Bill was on the right track by saying that he would sacrifice himself to fight the “30 brutal dictators” in this world, or would send himself to liberate and conquer Fallujah, but he didn’t get the right point across.&nbsp; The real answer comes to me from the lessons my father taught me so long ago.&nbsp; Your children make up their own minds; they are their own people, so if they want to join the military, and take the chance at being sent to war and die in the process that is their choice.&nbsp; I would support them whole heartedly, but what parent in their right mind would send their child off into danger?&nbsp; I think Michael Moore’s question is getting old; he needs to find a new question to ask everyone.  On another note…  I thought that John Edwards was the breath of fresh air that John Kerry really needed.&nbsp; He’s young, he’s enthusiastic, he’s charismatic, all of the characteristics that Kerry himself is lacking.&nbsp; Then after listening to him speak you realize just how little experience Edwards has.&nbsp;   He is a first term Senator, who most likely was not going to be reelected.&nbsp; His speech was nostalgic with his “Two Americas” theme that made him so famous and nearly won him the nomination.&nbsp; He of course tweaked this theme a bit to match the theme of the Kerry Campaign.&nbsp; What sets him out as inexperienced are his empty promises.&nbsp;   His speech last night was full of ideas which he did not (and probably cannot) back up with facts on how to carry out these ideas. &nbsp;How does this demonstrate his inexperience you ask?&nbsp; Well truth be told his campaign for Senate was evidently filled with these same types of empty promises.&nbsp; And because he did not follow up on these promises he most likely was not going to get reelected.&nbsp; See Edwards is a trial lawyer by nature, he knows how to talk the talk, but when it comes to walking the walk, he seems to falter a bit.&nbsp; I have to give him credit though, he is the nominee for Vice President, and he definitely has a lot of time to prove me wrong, he really could be the shining star.  Where he also fell short is that he just couldn’t live up to his hype last night.&nbsp; Mainly because the Democrats allowed the Reverend Al Sharpton to hijack the national spotlight last night.&nbsp; He rolled into the Bush bashing, and went off on a tirade.&nbsp; I won’t really say more than he hijacked the stage and stepped off the agenda, not to mention his prepared remarks.&nbsp; I won’t say more than that, because mainly I have a personal dislike for Al Sharpton, and this is not the time to get into that, I will save that for another blog at another time. Speaking of hijacking this election, who exactly is running for president, George Bush and John Kerry, or their daughters?&nbsp; Although it would be interesting to see who exactly would win the popular vote in that category, Cate Edwards could definitely throw a wrench in everyone’s plans.&nbsp;&nbsp; But I digress…
So we live in a free society you say?&nbsp; The reality of it all is that we live in a free society with limitations.&nbsp;   So you are innocent until proven guilty you say?&nbsp; The reality of it all is that you are PRESUMED innocent until proven guilty.&nbsp; So yes, you may in fact be guilty; however we would have to pretend that you are innocent until convicted by a jury of your peers or otherwise admitting to your crime.   So we are under the rule of a democracy you say?&nbsp; We really live in a republic.&nbsp; A Democracy is when we really have a say in how our government is run, what laws we want and each of us has a say in how things are run.&nbsp; We are a republic; we elect people to represent us in the government, to make the decisions for us.&nbsp;   You must believe in something because the people who elected you believe in that you say?&nbsp; Why not run on what you believe, and if the people don’t agree then you will lose your election.&nbsp; Why be fake?&nbsp; Why lie to yourself, to your constituents, to me?&nbsp;   Getting back to those limitations, if I have to stand in line for an hour to get on a plane, I won’t complain because at least then I know I should be safe in that tube with wings.&nbsp; Or at least as safe as you can be in a tube with wings that is flying at a billion miles per hours tens of thousands of feet in the air.   I did it, but I did it because society made me do it, society is why I turned out like this, you say…&nbsp; Why in the hell can’t you take responsibility for your own actions?&nbsp; I didn’t mean to kill this guy, but I was on drugs and the drugs made me do it.&nbsp; Why not say, hey, I was the dumbass that took drugs, I was the dumbass that killed that person, and I am the dumbass who can’t take responsibilities for my own actions.   What is the meaning of is anyway?&nbsp; Is that why he can’t say I am sorry?&nbsp; I mean come on, do you need me to buy you a dictionary.&nbsp; Just say I’m sorry I lied to the country and the world, just say I’m sorry I betted on baseball, just say I’m sorry I misled stockholders so I could make a measly 5,000 dollars.&nbsp; If a
