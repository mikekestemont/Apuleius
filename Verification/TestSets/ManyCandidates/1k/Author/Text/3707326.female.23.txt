CURRENT MOOD:  worked up, a little sweaty. CURRENT MUSIC:  thriller  NOTABLE QUOTE:  "this computer has a security system.  it's not the most complicated that i've seen, but it's close.  i think i can override the system and reboot the alarms."  and  "he could have convinced the virgin mary to have sex with him while she was pregnant with jesus."  both by me.  it's my blog, bitches.  i can quote myself if i want.     if you'll notice, the current music is thriller.  i've spent the last couple of hours trying to learn the dance.  no, fuck that, i LEARNED the dance.  yeah, that's right.  don't make fun.  you know when you were a kid and you were watching the thriller video that you wanted to learn the dance and do it for all of your friends.  well, i too wanted to learn the dance, even if it is 15 years later.  besides, perhaps some friends and i will perform this little number at camp booze.  would be funny.    not much going on.  getting stalked, but other than that, shit is kosher.  travis, my mother and i were planning on going to the MD/VA area this weekend for the 4th, but something has come up, so we must stay in town.  on the bright side, steph is coming in, and brian mentioned he MIGHT come in if we can't, so perhaps independance day will be fun afterall.  i'm pretty sure travis, james and natalie are off sat and sun so maybe we can catch some fireworks, THE REAL ONES.  not the ones travis and james will spend the majority of their food money on.      went to bdubs tonight for sarah's last night in town.  had fun, lots of friendly political debate and lively conversation.  my friends rock.    wed or thursday i want to go to athens, OH to see michael moore's new film.  i'm waiting for bear to come in to see it cause i think he'd appreciate it more than most of my friends.  i'm hoping to go thursday cause jesus is also going that day, but since it was bear's idea to do this, i'll go whenever he wants to.   interesting sidenote:  fahrenheit 911 is only playing in one theater in wv, and that theater is in BECKLEY.  you know, beckley, the cultural hotbed of forward thinking in west virginia.  i'm pretty sure "soul plane"  opened in more fucking theaters than that.  i'm out.

CURRENT MOOD:  sheepish CURRENT MUSIC:  blackstreet (it's 1997 all over again) NOTABLE QUOTE:   travis walking into my house:  "hey jules, you're not naked are you?"  Julie (mom):  "travis, you couldn't handle it."    so yeah, after a long hiatus from the blogging, i must pick back up where i left off.  i have described almost all of my MOV friends...except for the bitch.  no, no, not me.  i'm talking about:  ms. natalie jane case.   readers, dust off your gucci bags, burberry sunglasses, prada jeans, jimmy choo heals, and your gap favorite t's.  if you want natalie to talk to you, you must be wearing at least 2 of these items.  natalie is a walking contradiction.  no, she's not really as materialistic as i said before, but she's trying to be.  she wants to turn her nose down at poor people and roll her eyes at the muslims and tighten her grip on her purse when the blacks walk by...but really, she can't.  she's too level-headed, well-read, cultured, and open-minded to do those things.  while no one enjoys a good racist joke as much as natalie, she's also smart enough to know that those things are un-truths and everyone is really equal, yada, yada...  natalie comes from a bit of money, so she's never really been without anything growing up.  but you couldn't tell.  well, you could from the clothing she wears, but that's it.    HOW I KNOW NATALIE:  worked with her at gap.  hated her immediately.  way too loud, conceited, self-righteous.  eventually i realized those were the same qualities that i possessed, so i gave her a shot.  soon saw the potential in her for making fun of everyone.  one time, shortly thereafter, she made out with travis, but neglected to tell me.  i was pissed off and didn't talk to her for a week.  i thought she was going to take my tnut away from me, cause honestly, natalie is just a conniving bitch.  needless to say, they only made out one more time after that.  if that happened today, however, i'd be all for it.  FAVORITE MEMORIES:  hilton head, as mentioned before.  going to cedar point with her and gap people (200 fannypacks!), R1 and R2, hateful voicemails to each other (are we still friends?), the pink satin comforter new year's eve, jack answering the phone, breaking it down on her couch, yep, still got it, about that....  FUN NATALIE FACTS:  she's a vegetarian, and has been for like 10 years.  she just doesn't like meat.  but she'll eat eggs.  hypocrite.  her great great great great grandfather was VP under calvin coolidge.    she is also lactose intolerant.  love that soy.  natalie does not like to talk about money.  not sure why.  she won't tell how much she spends on anything.  it's so secretive and so unnecessary.  for christmas one year, i gave natalie a picture frame that i painted.  as a joke, i put a picture of my ass in it.  she kept it in there.  go to her house today and ask to see my ass.  she can show you.  one time, natalie had sex in her hot tub (we all know who with), and soon thereafter, jack got rid of it.  try not to soil the hot tub in canaan valley, okay nat?  natalie likes nascar.  it's so fucked up.  she should like horse racing.  do not touch natalie with your feet.  she hates it.  feet totally gross her out.  it's actually kind of phobic.  natalie used to be agnostic (look it up retard), but she recently found christ.  no, n
