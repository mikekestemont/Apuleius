Why do you think I'm beautiful? What is it that you see? I'm just a pinch of nothing This isn't really me  You tell me that I'm beautiful But if you only knew How grotesque I truly am How desperately untrue  What does it mean to be beautiful? I'm not the word at any rate Some say it means to be a star Good looking, glamorous, and great  Why do you think I'm beautiful? What is it that you see? If want to dig deep, then when I'm asleep I'm just the little old me  Oh no, I am not beautiful Not outside, and not in It's an uphill battle with myself And I can't ever win

A part of me is missing A part of me is gone A part of me that loved someone And now I must live on  A part of me is aching A part of me that breaks That part of me, the heart of me Do I have just what it takes?  A part of me is weaker A part of me is dead A part of me wants to hide And remove the thoughts in my head  But most of me is stronger I know that in my soul But that part of me that is eating me Is taking full control  A part of me will heal soon And someone will take that place Where you used to be, deep inside me Your laugh and your beautiful face  So part of me is growing And soon will be a scar For I know that you'll be, watching just me And it helps that I know where you are
Farewell, goodbye, it's not enough With all that we've been through Last night so fitfully you slept As I sat with you  How I will move on I do not know And so today I cried A star was born, a star that fell Today, the day you died  A rose that's lost its thorns will not Feel an ounce of pain It blooms and leaves this world and yet A memory remains  An extra ray of sun will shine More sparkle to the rain I'll see you everywhere I go And I'll feel the pain  You'll be in my heart each day You're happy where you've gone At loss I feel, my tears are real But your soul it still lives on  *In memory of my Nana, who passed away Father's Day 2004 at the Conner residence.*
I still dream  I dream and it's always the same  Midnight blue and glitter and floating away  Sometimes I wish there was nothing there  But mostly I just want to hold on  &nbsp;  I want to hold on to a world that I've made  The one that I had for a split second in time  A fantasy where I win  A place&nbsp;where everything falls exactly into step  &nbsp;  For an entire year I let my heart do the dreaming  I never said a word and never let that dream become real  I left my dream unrealized and then I was too scared  Things got to complicated, and so did I  &nbsp;  Hate masked everything I really felt  As it often does in life  Unfortunately for me that hate was all that was on the other side  It was what you were really feeling  &nbsp;  It's not fair that things worked out the way they did  That I said I'd be alright when I could think of something else for a grain of time  I'm still not alright  I remember that when I wake up  &nbsp;  A hole in my resides for our restitution  I would give anything to take back all of the horrible things I said, and did  To go up to you that last day and say thank you  To tell you how I really feel, it's not right that you still don't know  &nbsp;  How I know that writing this is just like writing with invisible ink  No mark is left, for you won't see it  You're gone out of my life, only a thread holds my hope together  A thread I don't have the heart to manipulate to find you, to pour out my heart  &nbsp;  I am devoid of rhyme or&nbsp;sugar coated words&nbsp;to let this all out  It's raw and bitter and yet beautiful  I still love, I still hate, but mostly I just think about you  I'll be alright when I can stop&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  I guess I'll never be alright&nbsp;  &nbsp;
Across a dark and stormy sea His memory still calls to me  A fraction of my forever life Went back to sleep by his faithful wife  How in the stars or heavens could he Leave someone beautiful as me  Go to a country far and away When with enchantment eternal he could stay  The gods forget their earthly friends They don't forgive, don't make amends  So far gone, I am alone Wishing him here, back to his island home  I can give him so much more than she can He showed me what love was like from a man  Years from then, and still I pine For that man I belong to, in my heart he's still mine  Forever I long for, eternally I miss My heart's lost piece, Odysseus  *I wrote this in ninth grade for an english assignment.  I thought this is how Calypso the enchantress must have felt when Odysseus left her in Homer's "The Odyssey".*
You my friend who knows me best Seem to act in my behest  But using your name and your witty charm Taking a hand and then taking an arm  Do you know what you're doing?  Is it all in your purse? Or am I for all nothing writing this verse?  So trixy and coy, you seem to be Is it seem or a dream, or are you after me?  I asked if there was a problem with my going right in Not thinking I was committing the largest of sin  But the way that you publish and the way that y
