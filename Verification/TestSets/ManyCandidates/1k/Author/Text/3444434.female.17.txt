Well, It's been a lil while since i have written and i've got alot to write. My feelings are soo mixed up right now. I don't know how to feel really, i mean i know how i should feel. But i just dunno...i think Josh is trash and i deserve a hell of alot better then him, but at the same time i still remember good things and those feelings are still there. I mean they arent just gunna go away with the snap of a fingere. I cant even write about it.. i just i dont even know what to say.
I'm gettin pretty damn tired of caring so much about josh..i just wish i didnt care at all. It would be soo much easier when he disapoints me. I mean i care about him sooooo  fucking much. I wanna spend my time here with him and just have fun with him while i can, but i dont know either he doesnt get that and he thinks i still will get attached and that i will get hurt no matter what i say..or he just doesnt wanna spend time with me or doesnt care if im here for a limited time. And if thats the case he should just let me know soo i dont waste my time on it i could be doing other things while im here like NOT FUCKING CARE!  It's frusterating to me, because if i just knew exactly and TRUTHFULLY how he felt i could either keep going on caring and wanting to spend time with him adn trying to spend time with him WHILE im here, OR me do my best and not care and not even try to see him or anything. Ya know but i cant read Fucking minds ya know.. i need to know this kinda shit. I wanna SCREAAM i cant take it.  Trying to figure it out makes me just annoyed and frusterated and makes me say FUCK IT and just stop everything. But that mean there is a HUGE chance i wont see him again. and that kills me and i cant take that. I wish soo much i didnt care. I wish i was the kind of person that didnt care about people...the kind of person that didnt give a shit about what other people think, or how they feel. The kind of person that doesnt get attached. I would love that. But thats not me i care about people, i care a little to much.  I dont see how two people could spend time together and seem so happy together and act all in love like.  And Be sweet to each other and just act a certain way and be soo real about it..and only one of the two poeple mean it and truly feel it. It's weird it's just like you never know if somthing is true or not. You never know if somthing is real or not. So i guess its kinda like you have to live your life either never knowing and always guessing, or just asuming that its not. You cant get your hopes up and you cant believe every little thing someone does is becasue they care or they are even being sincere. You gotta take care of yourself, you gotta look out for your self. If there is chance you get hurt, then Fuck it, its only gunna bring pain u dont need it.Fuck IT.. From now on this is what i live by....or at least try.
Well he finally text me back and he says...i just dont wanna hurt you anymore than you've already been hurt in your life. I said you cant hurt me and how would you hurt me?  He says i dont know, im just looking out for you. Thank you but you dont have to, i mean i care about you alot i just wanna spend time with you while im here and have fun not think about anything.  I really appreciate him worrying about hurtting me no other guy have ever dont that. I love him for that. That makes everything i feel for him that much stronger. I mean i care about him more than i have ever cared about a guy and knowing that he really does care and that he's looking out for me just makes me i dont know. Makes me want him even more.  If i could have one wish...just one it would be a tie between putting my parents back together my family, or to have him for the rest of my life. Its a tought one. I mean i should say put my family back together forever, but i dont know the thought of having him forever...for the rest of my life it the ultimate happiness to me. Never will i be sad, never will i hurt or long.  All day long after talking to sarah this morning, i was just in a funk. Depressed all day becasue i thought he was going to stop talking to me and just blow me completely off and that kills me to think of that ever happening. AGAIN! i wanna be with him entirely and completely. I would change my whole life for him. Thats sad because he wouldnt for me. And he doesnt feel the same exact way as i do..thats okay i cant expect him to. I know he cares about me though alot. But im just more there i guess i dont know its different.  Im soo gratefull for him, im so gratfull for everything he does to me..everything he makes me feel. Gratefull for him careing so much.
Well last night i was at Josh's house and things were very different. Jeremy, sarah, and i went to the store, got food, and alcohol and we come home and josh was just chillin on his computer. But not just for a little while the WHOLE time, then after the computer he gets up and decides he wants to go for a drive. I didnt know what the hell was g
