Angry, Hurt, Disappointed. I don't know what to say. They say they are loyal, but do they even know what they are loyal to? They don't even know him. How can they even decide on TOBI's fate when they haven't seen what he can do? Even Marcus makes the decision blindly. With all my heart I love the boy, but he is no programmer. He wouldn't know TOBI's capabilities if TOBI were able to walk up and smack him over the head. From his reaction, I would guess that there is no way for me to convince him. He's made up his mind and he'll follow through to whatever end he regards as best. He always has been stubborn like that. If only Jude or Marty one would have survived. They would have been able to convince him.  I can't believe how much finger pointing is going on. Someone actually accused me today of killing the boys. I can't believe that people would do that. How can they even think that? Uninformed decisions, assumptions...that is not the world that I'm from. Rather presumptuous...wretched....and downright hurtful. I hope none of these people ever talk to Virginia....it would break her heart.  I'm leaving Wednesday night to return to Amboy. I hope to find something that Marty left behind as a clue. He was such a prankster that he might've left us something unintentionally even. I hope so and I also hope that Ms. Heller will be willing to help. She seems at least to have an open mind about what TOBI can do, and haven't I always said, that's all that it takes.
He knows not what he is asking for. Can he possibly realize the potential that he would be destroying? My boy, if you are reading this...please, contact me. We must discuss the future. Like a child, he is learning and needs a safe environment to do so...won't you help him? I pray that you will reconsider the options, and know that I will help you in whatever way I can, but destruction is not the answer. Both Jude and Marty are gone and yet part of them lives on...we can't lose that nor can we lose you. You know where to find me...  Perhaps that sweet reporter can help. I think I'll get in touch with her...maybe not today, but soon.
The funeral was touching. After arriving back in OR, I was asked to be a pallbearer. I was reluctant to leave Virginia's side for even a moment, but she insisted that I honor Jude's memory. I couldn't bear to think of Jude being gone, hell, I still can't bear to think it. Whoever did this awful thing...whoever decided it was their right or duty or whatever to take away a life such as his...what is this world coming to? A bright light has been extinguished and yet, there are so many that don't even realize.  Marty's memorial service was quite peaceful. I had held onto hope that Marty would miraculously show up somewhere alive. It would be just his style to scare us to death and then show up laughing at us all. Instead, Melody was heartbroken to tell me the news after his memorial service that his body had been found.   That girl is really something, and how she can be a reporter is beyond me. All the reporters that I've known until now have been certifiable jerks; they claim they have to be to get the inside scoop. Melody though seems to be different; her vigor and charm, I'm sure, helps her to get whatever scoop she might be interested in.
My poor dear boys. I cannot describe the feelings of tremendous grief that I am encountering. Yet, I must be strong for Virginia as her tender heart is breaking and I do not have the cure. Are we safe? Do I even dare to wonder if Marcus is and will be safe? If nothing else, I hope that the new employees will keep any information about his whereabouts safe. Perhaps together we can all protect him.
How relaxed can a body be? I really hadn't realized how tense I was until I returned home and was able to tune in to myself and Virginia. She has been so good to me and we've been working around the house together which has been such a relief. Just being around her can change one's demeanor. Now if only I could get my mind back to Phoenix as well.  TOBI is an amazing discovery. The boys told me how great he had become but I think that even they still have no idea of his depth. Jude shared some thoughts with me over the phone yesterday about how it seems that TOBI is just as anxious to be ready for launch as we are. It's so strange to be talking about "him" like he's a person, but when people put as much into a project as the boys have, it's difficult not to see parts of them in it. I hope everything goes smoothly with launch and that Jude can make a trip out to Phoenix to visit with Virginia and I...I know she misses him dearly.
Thank goodness I will finally have a couple hours rest today. I'm exhausted and exhilarated at the same time. Marty and Jude seem to have everything under control now and I can finally relax, but I just can't seem to settle down. There is something strange going on with TOBI, and everyone seems to be aware of it, although none of the boys want to talk about it. I do hope they're careful...  Enough - I've decided that it's time to get back to my darling Virginia, I've missed her so. I wonder if she'll have some of those delicious sugar cookies ready when I get there...
I don't suppose I have to say again what a pain it is to be here. It must be ten times worse for poor Virginia, who has done nothing to deserve all of this. I feel terrible that she is h
