Life Is Such A Swirl                    I' ve been getting swelling headaches lately, not the kind that you pop in two tylenol and everything will be all right, eh? No, the kind that makes you want to astral project into another world and be in a happy place. That's the kind the way I felt this morning, I truly didn't want to get up, really I truly didn't want to get up at 5:15am this morning, this happens three times a week and when the alarm buzzed off I put on MTV2 and what do you know? This kick out deranged video from outer space comes on, its bright pink and very very cheesy. the group is called "The Darkness" and ther lead singer looks like a younger Steven Tyler from Aerosmith (found out his name is Justin Hawkins), wearing a Viva Las Vegas Elvis-type outfit, and he has bad overbites everywhere. I find this music video very funny and the song very catchy.                 Later as usual I bought me a grande mocha-white chocolate to pump in the adrenaline in me, and "The Bastard"( my boss, don't we all have nicknames for our bosses?) from work introduce to me a new employee, named Andrew. So basically I got to cashier oversee, for those of you who saw my picture in last month's ColeHardware.com the guy pictured next to me had been let go. We have these new palm pilot type machines that gets transactions done quicker and everyday I have to repeat myself like a broken record in guiding customers to use that machine and deal with  Retail Hell. So I came up with an idea, even though "The Bastard" will strip it off because my job doesn't allow new ideas and they are good ones too. But for now, I put the words "Use The Wand" so that it will help customers use the self serve machine better.            So everything feels like a swirl because it seems I have so little time, yet so much to do like homework,chores,work,having a little social life. I want to give short outs to Ben V.(sorry, I convinced you to apply at my job, but work is work and your doing a great job!), Stuart B. (Can't wait to see your directorial debut and thanks for the flower) and Paul Smith (thanks for linking me and letting me being part of Amipow.com)    Song of the Moment : "Maybe Tomorrow" by The Stereophonics
From Friday the 13th and so on        So this past week my night started on Friday the 13th. I don't think of it as bad luck too me, it is just another day. But I will tell you my worst day tends to be Wednesday the 11th. Why Wednesday the 11th, I 'll tell it to ya, to me it is just bad luck two days prior to the 13th because on those Wednesdays the 11th, I have lost two wallets, replace my house keys at least 3 times, sprained my right ankle on the Muni Bus( San Francisco's excuse for public transportation) and been in various mortifying situations (Don't even ask).      So I went shopping to Macy's with my cousin Janette and friend Alexis. Janette and I went dress shopping, while Alexis just went shopping. I had mentioned earlier to Janette why I utterly ignore Valentine's Day. Like most people I suppose, I'm not a masochist of any sort, I just haven't had a Valentine Card since third grade and getting Valentine Cards from relatives doesn't court. So Janette was kind enough to get me a card, cute teddy bear, and pink rose, even though she is my second-cousin and and a relative. I thought it was very nice of her to buy me one. I felt special..I ended up buying a two dresses and a J-Lo manufacture outfit that my cousin told me,"It's a must-have for my booty-girl cousin". Her words, not mine.    Saturday, I was sad because I broke my glasses and I haven't planned on spending so much money to replace them it was so sad because I was  going to use my money to pay bills, and probably be consume eating sushi and buying cd's. So I guess it was karma or fate or something I can't explain. I was going to be late to Laura's wedding(my coworker)and I had to travel to Pacifica(5 miles south of San Francisco). I was a nervous wreck but I got see my co worker get married and everything went smooth from there.     Today, I was getting over a slight congested cough and runny nose and I felt brave enough to sing in choir class and eat some lunch while the rain outside pours in buckets every twenty minutes or so. I am inside and I greet my friend Pete who is a culinary student and cashier today and he gave me a discount. I Love you Pete. Then I listen as my friend Barbara was trying to sign up people for a Green Party Campaign. I think politics is very interesting and all but it's just a huge mess. I try not to get too involved, its too messy. Anyway, I met a new friend named Ryan P. and before we exchange names and all I had mention I always meet guys who have last names that start with an "S". And I read him some poems because I am deeply into that and when I was into High School, writing to me was an essential escape in my lonely world. I got 3 hours to kill until Math class.  So long!
My name is Jennifer E. I am from San Francisco but real bay area natives would call it "Frisco Bay" or "Frisco" whatever. I got inspired to start this blog because I always felt I should express my thoughts. Some people know me as "JuneK" because of the screen name JenniferJuniper which is in fact a song I heard when watching the film "Election" with Reese Witherspoon. Toward the end the lesbian character (Not Reese's Character.."Tracy") has a new girlfriend a
