so i spent most of my day battling the urge to do nothing... I LOST ! i woke up this morning and went to feed the dog and there were thousands of flying ants all over the kitchen window..looks like they were coming out of the air conditioning vent..ack... killed them they came back killed them they came back killed them I WIN! i did some laundry, drank some great coffee, walked the dog, smoked a cig or two..yeah yeah they're bad for me..so is reality tv and i don't bitch at you! i found a picture i took of part of a triptych i painted..so i posted it...probably belongs in the   urlLink museum of bad art  but what the hell eh? surfed around a bit and found out there's a plethora of well written blogs...warms my cockels to know that there really are some fairly literate people in this world...why do i always run into the ones with that look on their face ..you know the one..vacuous i guess is a good word that's about all the nothing i feel like writing now.. check back later i may be able to bore you further!
urlLink    self potrait in neon&nbsp; urlLink   this is done in acrylics...i painted it last summer...my boyfreind takes a lot of photographs..so i used one and played with color in photoshop..and i thought this color combo was interesting..it seems to stop looking like a nude figure and becomes something else..
urlLink Surgical Strikes  this guy is great..short and to the point..even if there isn't one!
well...i got a lot done so far today...sent off for grade transcripts to a college i went to for one semester,sent off an admission application,put some dough in the bank for my boyfreind,bought some Oxyclean to see if i can't rescue these nasty couches...my boyfreind's dog has been sleeping on them for eight years so they look like crap..oh well..any way..the biggest thing is no one seems to know where my high school transcripts are...or even if i got a GED or a high school diploma..if i have to take the GED i'm gonna scream..20 years is a long time away from school i dont remember anything!!!!!!!can you imagine...i mean how much American History do you really remember? how often as a stay at home mom do you nactually use algebra..my linguistic skills are pretty good..you could even say i'm a "cunning linguist"..sorry bad joke..i think today to do something a lil different between cleaning this disaster area and figuring out my transcript dilemma im going to relearn html and redo this page ..it is kind of boring using the pre-made templates!..im trying not to watch the news today i am having a hard time with the Abu Grhaib story.......the guys on the lower rung are gonna really get stung on this one...bye for now..be well

well...here goes...my first time blogging..no one will even read this i'm sure..if they do they may notice i don't capitalize...or use periods...mostly because i don't feel it's necessary..i write how i speak...today was a busy day trying to figure out how much i could work without losing medicaid...you see i'm a bit on the nutty side..coocoo for cocoa puffs...and no job i've ever had will pay for the therapy or the meds nor will insurance cover it..so i have to exist on a measly 500 a month ..at least until i finish school..what am i going to be you ask?...why a social worker.. i'm going to fix broken people...who better than someone who is herself broken in a way that is almost unfixable...but it really was a beautiful day if i step out of my whiny self ..the sun was out and the sky was a cerulian blue and thank whoever...no cicadas yet!..well that's it for now..no..wait one more thing...i haven't been to school in twenty years...and i have to provide records from schools i don't even remember the names of..this is gonna be fun!!!!!!!...now i'm done...stay tuned for more mundane mediocrity!
