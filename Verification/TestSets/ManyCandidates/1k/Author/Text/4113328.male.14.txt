If God had a refrigerator, your picture would be on it. If He had a wallet, your photo would be in it.  He sends you flowers every spring. He sends you a sunrise every morning. Whenever you want to talk, He listens. He can live anywhere in the universe, but...He chose your heart. And...that thing He did at Calvary... Face it, friend - He is crazy about you!  God didn't promise days without pain, laughter without sorrow, sun without rain, but He did promise strength for the day, comfort for the tears, and light for the way.
Often in times of trouble we don't know what to say, So we choose to say nothing, and sometimes run away. When friends are really hurting, we don't know what to do, So we offer weak excusesor or say we're hurting too. It really doesn't matter what kind of gift we bring; We only need to be there if we don't bring a thing. It truly is amazing what a hug can do, When heartache numbs the senses, and friends depend on you. There's comfort just in knowing that you are not alone, When tears are overflowing, and hearts are cold as stone. It's the loving prayers of others that balance our accounts, For when we measure love, it's still the thought that counts.
hello i decided that one a week ill post a poem quote and other stuff. i think ill post it on sat but im in the mood to post on now ok lah  cya later ja bye bye
question: You die and find yourself confronted by two guards at the gates of heaven and hell. You know that one of the guards always tells the truth, and the other always lies. You don't know which is which, and by asking one, and only one, question you need to figure out which one is the gate to Heaven (or hell, if you're adventurous). What will you ask?  answer :If I ask the other guard whether this is the path to heaven, what will he say  The liar is on the path to heaven. If you ask him my question, he knows that the truth teller would answer "yes". So he lies about the answer and says "no". The liar is on the path to hell. If you ask him, he knows that the truth teller would answer "no", so he lies and says "yes". The truth teller is on the path to heaven. You ask him the question. He knows that the liar will lie and say "no", so that's what he says. The truth teller is on the path to hell. He knows that the liar would lie and say "yes", so that's what he says.  so there we have it, im not crazy  untill next time of the Chronicles of Narnia, ja bye bye

Hello, Tis Lx here writing in Danie's wonderful weblog... why you say? Because I just want to see how keen people are going to be when they begin this weblog trend. *shakes head*  another reason as to why, is because Danie is my wonderful *cough* brother who allows me to write in his weblog, of course that's without any force what so ever used by the control of his much better older sister! *shifts eyes*  In any case, I would like to congratulate all those who are using this thing... and probably shake my head at how sad it probably could become it used like... yes like MSN...  Umm what else is there to rant about? Hey to all I know, which is probably YF and church... and whatever randoms that come up.  I wonder how long will this last...  Enjoy.  Lx- the loving and kind sister of Danie.... .... ... shuddup... no need for laughter...  p.s. I'll be back... muahhahahahaha... and take over his weblog... then soon I'll take over the world!
i realy hope this works :s
