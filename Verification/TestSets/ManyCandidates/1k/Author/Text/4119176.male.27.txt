Today's Stock Market Looks A Lot Like Dow Back In The Early '30s BY JONAH KERI  INVESTOR'S BUSINESS DAILY  Investors trying to make sense of the market's confusing signals need only crack open a history book for the answer. It's 1921-1934 all over again.  The thought may send shivers down the spines of many. That period included one of the worst one-day collapses in market history in October 1929. That was followed by insolvent banks, a government in over its head, a drought that devastated food supply and, ultimately, the Great Depression.  A look at the accompanying chart below shows the clear parallel between the Dow of '21 to '34 and the Nasdaq of 1992 to today. Where the market is concerned, history constantly repeats itself.  It's Human Nature  "We're dealing with human behavior here, and that never changes," said market historian Jeff Hirsch, president of The Hirsch Organization and editor of The Stock Trader's Almanac. "People pay bills every month, hold Christmas parties every year, presidents get elected every four years. There is a general rhythm to society that does affect market movements."  Whatever the era, human emotion has always ruled the market. When strong gains lead to excessive speculation, disciplined investing to greedy cash grabs, that is when stocks run into trouble.  The similarities between the two eras go beyond behavioral science, though. The 1920s ushered in an era of rapid economic growth and technological change. Led by Henry Ford cranking cars off the assembly line, consumer demand skyrocketed. RCA's ascent through the innovation of the radio portended an exciting future. A healthy job market and booming stock market combined to fuel an era known as the Roaring '20s   1 .   View larger image  The 1990s looked much the same. Instead of cars and radio, the proliferation of the PC and Internet dramatically increased companies' productivity. A boom in electronic gadgets stoked consumer demand. The job market again firmed, favorable economic policies reigned and the market notched massive gains   1 . The final, furious leg up from late 1998 to early 2000 exceeded even the 1920s' enormous gains.  Back To The '30s?  Though few people want to revisit the stock market crash of '29, the bursting of the Nasdaq's bubble in 2000   2  rivaled the Dow's collapse some 70 years earlier   2 . The Dow tanked 89.5% from September 1929 to July 1932. The Nasdaq plunged 78.4% from March 2000 to its bottom in October 2002. Even the length of the two down cycles was similar: 34 months for Dow '29-32, 31 for Nasdaq '00-02.  "In both cases what you had was excess capacity," said Fred Fern, head of Los Angeles-based money management firm Churchill Management. "In 1929, there were 166 automobile companies. That's what you had with many tech companies in the late '90s. Demand kept rising and rising and capacity kept going up, until finally demand slowed down and everything fell apart."  Fern uses a war room setup in his L.A. offices, showing every market cycle dating back to the '20s. On the room's walls, he's tracked 12 complete market cycles, bull and bear included, since 1942.   In 10 of those 12 instances, the recovery from a bear market has been a two-legged affair. The market takes off on an initial bull run, then corrects, usually for nine to 12 months. The second leg up occurs after the market has gone through that correction, defined as one or more of the major indexes falling 10% to 20%.  Now look at the chart of the two market cycles on this page. The Dow's bottom in 1932 resembles the Nasdaq's in 2002. Both times the market rallied briefly, then bided its time. A few months later — starting in March 1933 for the Dow   3 , March 2003 for the Nasdaq   3  — the market started a new bull run in earnest.   The Dow took 11 months to reach a peak in February 1934. It then dropped 24% over the next few months   4 . Though that was a little beyond a typical intermediate correction's length, the harsh circumstances of the time created a choppier environment.   The Nasdaq took 10 months to reach a peak in January 2004. It's since corrected 17% the last seven months   4 . Coming off another massive run-up and huge bear market, a correction could go a bit beyond 20% again.   Here's where the chart diverges. The Dow zoomed 131% from July 1934 to March 1937   5 . The move came despite the effects of the Dust Bowl, the rise of Hitler and the Great Depression.   Today, the economy has held up better. Technological advances have changed the way companies do business, unemployment has remained low compared with historical levels, and consumer spending has stayed in decent shape. Just as reforms in the banking industry proved a huge stabilizer in the '30s, the government hopes a cleanup of the mutual fund industry will help restore investor confidence. A round of tax cuts has also helped.  So will history repeat itself again?   The rebound may come quicker or slower than it did in the '30s. But just as foreign conflicts, recessions and recoveries, swings in energy supply and demand, and polarizing elections have sprung up again, so too will the market.  It did in the Roaring '20s, the World War II-related boom of '42-46, via the Nifty Fifty stocks of the late '60s and early '70s, and multiple other times. It will again.
BusinessWeek Online Realize It or Not, We're All in Sales Monday August 16, 8:06 am ET    When people ask me what I do and I reply that I'm in sales, they sometimes sigh and say, "Gee, I'm so glad I'm not in your business." I used to wonder at that reaction, because I love being in sales. Maybe they didn't hear right, perhaps believing that I'd "just got out of jail." But then, when I take a closer look at their faces, it becomes all too clear that they were serious! Professional salespeople make more money than some lawyers or doctors. They a
