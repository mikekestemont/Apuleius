I had a dream last night about a friend of mine from high school whom I haven't seen in at least a year and a half.  It was one of those weird dreams that involve lots of people that you know but who don't know each other in real life, though they do in the dream, and it had one of those houses that suddenly become different houses depending on how you walk through it... Dreams are so weird sometimes, nothing is constant in them, especially buildings.  Anyways, I haven't seen this friend in quite a while and have completely lost touch with him, but apparantly my brain decided to think of him last night.  It was one of those dreams that are strongly emotional (what!! emotional?? but heather ann, that's so unnatural for intjs like you!! -- i know, but i was DREAMING... the strangest things can exist in dreams, even emotional intjs!) and they stay with you for a while.  I think I miss that friend.  I would like to know what he's up to lately.  There are far too few entertaining boys in my life right now.  So, Sanda, what I'm trying to say is that while people from your past are haunting you in waking life, the people from my past are haunting me in dreaming life, and I'm not sure what I would prefer.  Probably dreaming life, actually.  It's random but nice sometimes and I can ditch it when I wake up.  Do you think it's bad to never want to see people again?  More than that, do you think it's bad to make an effort not to see someone again?

Sometimes life is too random for comfort. I think everyone from my past should stop haunting me and if you are deciding that you are going to start, well don't. There is a reason I left you in my past. So other than the complete randomness of unexpected people I have been running into and talking to over the last couple weeks, everything is going swell and I think it's high time we enjoy some of that fine powder out there! Yay for my up coming snowboarding adventure!!!!

I went to school with  urlLink him .  Haha.  We weren't friends, I was very Christian and he listened to "satanic" music and smoked pot all the time.  Those profiles just get funnier as the years go by.  :)

I only have one thing to say about my date today:  I take back every negative thing I have ever said about boys ever.  They are wonderful creatures.  :)

urlLink This  is a great interview at  urlLink The Morning News  with Brian Greene, author of  urlLink The Elegant Universe  which has been on my To Read list for quite some time.  This blew my mind:  ‘The simplest assumption is that the universe will become ever darker, and ever emptier, as the galaxies recede from us and in the very far future, there will be nothing in evidence. Everything will have disappeared beyond the horizon.’   I found this part especially interesting, as it's a new way to look at things:    BG:  [My mom] is very concrete, [laughs] which is great. To me, I just gravitate toward – and I think many people do – let’s look at popular culture again. The Matrix, a very successful movie. Why? Well, it was a great movie (Matrix one, I am referring to) but at its heart it had the notion that what you see is not really what there is. That touches people, because everybody or many people are searching for a deeper reality and anything that kind of brushes up against a deeper reality.   RB:  I find that impulse a little frightening – its outcome is frequently religious dogma.   BG:  It can be for some people but for many people it’s not. Ultimately the deeper levels of reality that are subject to experimental testing, those are the ones that grab me. That’s not the right measure for the religious sensibility. My brother is a Hare Krishna and his deeper reality differs from mine. He finds it very fulfilling, what he does. It’s not his full-time occupation, but it is the grander picture for him. Now, that’s not an experimentally testable framework, I don’t think. And I don’t think that’s the right measure. For him, it’s a more spiritual measure. For me it’s, ‘Does it work? Can you test it in the lab? Can you test it through astronomical observations?’ I don’t think one is better than the other. Certainly one grabs me more than the other. But that’s a personal choice.

urlLink Meredi  thinks that I may have an ulcer, she says my symptoms sound the same as what she had when she had one.  So, maybe that's it.  Silly as this is, I never thought of it as being an actual physical problem, I just figured I got crazy when I got stressed out.  Of course, stress could certainly trigger an ulcer, and if I had one a year ago and now I've somehow kick-started it again, well, I should get that fixed.  So, I'm going to the walk-in clinic tomorrow.  Big day today!  Today we find out just how nice boys c
