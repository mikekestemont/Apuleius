Just got the Blogger email & signed up. My "name" is arizonacolbys - in case you had any doubts. :)  I just tried to send you out a pic of the Piggy cake I made for Kara tonight. I think it came out pretty cute & Colby & Arizona seem to like it. Hopefully everyone enjoys it tomorrow, I know I will. Still not sure what we're doing tomorrow evening - we've got Kara's birthday to celebrate before she disappears for the evening, the Strawberry Festival is this weekend & Craig wanted to see the Reds vs the Indians tomorrow night at 7. Not sure we can get it all done & I'm sure the weather will play a role in our final decision. Well, I better go - some cupcakes are calling my name - have fun on the road again tomorrow - I'll talk to you soon!  Love, Em :)
Arrived back in Willoughby to the new apartment late Saturday after a two day drive from Hutchinson. Since we only moved into the apartment 4 days before we headed out of town, it doesn't feel quite like home. But all our stuff is here, so it's at least familiar.  After unloading and cleaning up the mess, we gave the little dog, Dink, a bath. Had to get some of the road dirt off of him. Both the kids met us for a burger and a nice visit before going their separate ways.   Will be back at work on Monday, only 6 months now to finish out the year here. We plan a 3 week trip to Oregon in August, so there will be more adventures to post then. In the mean time, I'll try to post occasionally as we progress toward our goal.   What's the goal? Heading out on a permanent road trip in January 2005. Counting down will go fast from here on out.
Feels like Friday here, which is nice. Supposed to be 80 degrees & stormy this afternoon. Not showing such great weather for tomorrow, now. High of 68 & chance of rain. Planning on going to the zoo to visit some furry creatures, we'll have to see if the weather holds up. Maybe we'll see a movie instead. Going to the Captains game tomorrow night with some friends - it's a fireworks night, so we can stick around & watch some great fireworks from our seats after the game. It should be fun. Looking forward to seeing everyone on Saturday (or whenever you all return.)Have a great day in Kansas!
Hello- thanks for stopping by our Blog!  We arrived here in Hutchinson, Kansas on Monday morning. We had reserved space at the Great North American RV Rally, along with about 5,000 other RVers. Turns out almost 7 inches of rain in the last two weeks had eliminated a lot of planning parking areas in the fields surrounding the local airport. So after sitting in line on a two lane road for an hour, thinking we were about to be parked, we were informed it was time to turn around and go back home. The local sheriff came around telling everyone there were no more available parking spaces. A background note - this same rally was held here two years ago, and after parking everyone there was a deluge of rain. There were so many motorhomes stuck in mud up to the axle it took almost one month to get them all towed out of the fields. You can see why they reluctant to repeat this adventure.  We were about to turn around and head home, when our friends here found us a wonderful parking spot behind the local Microtel. So here we are, spending the week in Hutchinson, Kansas. Seems few people actually left, there are RVers stuck in every little nook of a parking space around town. The local mall looks like an RV convention of its own.  The weather has been great, the people are friendly, and the adventure continues.....  Thanks again for stopping by on our road trip.
It's a little on the cool side this morning, but the sun is shining brightly. It's quiet so far this morning - had to drop my Jeepster off at the tire store - discovered last night that I had a nail in my back tire. It should be ready to pick up sometime this morning. Our neighbors put up a shed in the backyard the day before yesterday. The dogs really weren't too sure about that, and they were sure to let everyone know how they felt about it. It's been too chilly to swim here most days - it's probably been a week since we've been in the pool. It doesn't stop Arizona though, she goes for a dip almost daily, sometimes many times daily. We went for Mexican food last night & it was yummy. Well, better get back to work - hope you're enjoying your time in the wheat fields! :)
Arrived in Breckenridge this afternoon. Breck is such a charming town surrounded by spectacular mountain ranges. Here it is the end of June and there is still snow on all the mountains. It was only 65 for a high today. Sure felt cooler after the heat of New Mexico. We're just enjoying the clear crisp mountain air. Tomorrow we plan to get out the bikes and see how far we can go!
Back to the RV for the night. Spent the day walking the streets of Sante Fe and just soaking in the sunshine and culture. I browsed the shops for a few hours and managed to refrain from buying anything big (since I don't have any place to put anything big anyway, this was wise.) We had an early dinner at the Blue Corn Cafe. Wonderful choice, food was great and we had a little table at an open window looking over the street below. After dinner we took a short walk and watched the sunset over the far mountain range. The views here at the park are truly beautiful.  Tomorrow morning we head f
