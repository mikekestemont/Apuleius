NEW JUGGLIN RELEASES!    Out now:  Artist: Linn Title: Available (+ Rasmus Faber & Hearin’ Aid Remixes) Cat#: JUGG002 Format: 12inch  Believe it or not but for the last years there’s been a rising soul movement emerging in Stockholm. With high quality artists, songwriters and producers like Salem, Melo, Freddie Cruger, André and Linn Stockholm finally have music that can match the beats from the US or UK. One of the strongest voices from Stockholm is singer and songwriter Linn. Even though she haven’t got any of her own material officially released so far she’s already recorded tracks with big name soul producers like James Poyser, Steve Harvey, Don E and Freddie Cruger.  On her single debut she’s coming down with a smooth boogie stepper produced by UK soul head Don-E. If you were down with the sounds of Loose Ends in the late 80s this will surely catch your ears. On remix duties we find a jazzy &amp; soulful house mix by man of the moment Rasmus Faber which is already played by some of the main US and UK house heads. But for those of you that dig your beats dirtier we also got a deep hip hop/soul remix by upcoming Stockholm crew Hearin’ Aid. Be on the lookout for a Hearin’ Aid 12” right here on Jugglin’ Records later this year. These cats got some seriously f***** up beats in their baggage. Believe that!  Tracklisting: A1.

Rapadon Title: Bap You Head (+ Up Hygh Remix) / Boogie Down Stureby Cat#: JUGG003 Format: 12inch Release Date: July / August 2004  Wohaaaa…the new Freddie Cruger joint his finally here and its supa hot! After the success with his first 12” on Jugglin’ (Running From Love / The Hustle) he’s now back together with Brooklyn MC Rapadon for a mega funky hip hop score which will blow up your DJ set. To spice it up a little extra there’s also a baaad (!) remix by Stockholm wonder kids Up Hygh that will please fans of the Pete Rock, J-Dilla and Madlib sounds. Yes, it’s that hot!!  But it’s on the flip where we’ll find the true winner. Boogie Down Stureby is nothing less but a 100% dancefloor mash-up! Imagine a slice of Lalo Schiffrin themes, mix it up with some fierce jazz-funk rhythms plus add some b-boy mentality and your almost there. Good peeps like Danny Krivit, Bobbito and Patrik Forge are just a few of the cats that have been spinning the hot in demand promos. Nuff heads was turning when this got dropped at Bobbitos weekly party at the Apartment in NYC a couple of weeks ago.  Tracklisting: A1. Bap Yo Head (Orig) A2. Bap Yo Head (Up Hygh Remix) B1.

The CD release will be out on June 1st. Expect everything from fierce sambas, swinging bossa burners but also a some more melodic compositions from this truly electric 6 piece orchestra from southern Sweden. Btw, they are bangin live as well!  A BOSSA ELÉTRICA – VEJA O SOL, SPIRITUAL SOUTH REMIX 12” (RAF012) After their world-renowned samba smash ”Tombo In 7/4” this south Swedish Brazilian outfit is yet again ready to burn up dance-floors across the globe. Their first single is a self written composition which initially heads into deep MPB territory but gradually picks up pace and later explodes when the mighty chorus drops. But to insure maximum floor action we let the south London Brazil nuts Spiritual South go loose on the track. The result is a devastating mash up of funky samba, uplifting house rhythms and rough wobble bass action. Peak time pressure guaranteed!  12th FLOOR - DONT THIS BLOW YOUR MIND, DMALICIAOUS DUB 12" (RAF013) Yep, 12th Floor is back again and this time we got a killer raregroove burner with a dirty Detroit feel that will do exactly what the title suggests...blow your mind! Theres also a cool DMalicious (Wave Rec) dub that goes even further on the elecctronic path...especially check the 4/4 break halfway in to the track. Should be hitting the shops sometime in mid June.  BEATFANATIC - ADVENTURES IN THE WORLD OF NO-FI BEATS 2xLP (RAFLP005) If you got hooked on the sounds of Jogando Capoeira or Electromagnetic Colours you wont be disspointed with his debut album. Not only do you get loads of brand new Beatfanatic tracks but also exclusive versions of some of the old jams which is only available on this double LP. Of the new tracks you should especially check out tunes like Deep Love and Mas Que Malandro wich is already played by some of the main DJ celebrities.  DAMN! - YOUTH STYLE CD + 2xLP (RAFCD/LP003) With the huge success of 12inches like Leaving This Planet and African Scanian selling around 3000 units each they are now ready to drop their debut album Youth Style. With a seriously diverse musical selection youll find everything from blue eyed soul, latin, afro-funk, rock and even electronic rhythms on the album. But even though it might sound shattered the album holds a strong identity which we think will convince any listeners. On the album you will also find the crossover Got To Go single which so far is only released as a CD single in Scandinavia. Its already cliimbing the pop charts and is getting both radio and video play all over Scnadinavia. Btw, damn! is an amazing live band as well! This was proven when they performed live at the Raw Fusion club in April where they almost blew the roof off the club.    urlLink  http://www.rawfusionrec.com/          elsewhere on the web:   urlLink  http://www.rawfusion.se/
