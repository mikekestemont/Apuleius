I stole that title from an "It's Happy Bunny" postcard.  Kind of made me feel all warm and tingly inside because I do in fact derive pleasure from certain people getting upset. Eh, judge all you want.  I do whatever I need to get me through the day.  So anyway, I got an email from a friend of mine about a possible side job working for a friend of a friend.  This is a semi-big deal because it'll help with my apartment fund.  She asked me if I got the voicemail she left for me at the house. Nope, didn't get it.  Then she told me her father, who is also my mechanic, has been trying to reach me all week to schedule time to look at my car.  Didn't get those messages, either.  There is only one person (besides me) who knows how to check the voicemail messages.  And if I'm checking them and there are none, either that means my good friend is lying to me or Her Majesty has been erasing my messages.  I should call and leave one in a phony voice just to see if she gives it to me or doesn't erase it, but I'm not in the mood for such pettiness.  I'll just clean the rim of the toilet with her toothbrush.  Again.  :)
Since it's been rather muggy the last couple of days, I am enjoying the comfort that is 65 degree, recycled air.  It actually got chilly enough in my room that I started thinking, "Hey, I want soup."  So I made the trek downstairs and into the kitchen.  I grabbed a pot from the safety zone- the area WAY behind all the other pots under the cabinet.  (And I didn't slam the cabinet door.)  I opened my soup, and being the impatient person I am, put it on the high setting on the front burner.  In the 5 minutes it took for me to boil my soup:  I washed my hands,  threw out my soup can, grabbed a spoon out of the drawer, washed off said spoon, checked to see if I had mail, and grabbed a bowl out of the upper cabinet.  I pulled my soup off the stove, poured it into my bowl, and high-tailed it back to my room.  15 minutes later, I'm in agony.  Not that anyone needs to know, and not that I enjoy sharing moments like these, but I have been in and out of the bathroom 5 times so far.  Soup wants out!!!  I don't think there was anything particularly wrong with my soup.  It was chicken and vegetable Campbell's or something similar, and I boiled the hell out of it just in case the pot WAS dirty.  I believe the culprit of my pain, the bane of my existence, was the dirty bowl.  I forgot to wash the bowl when I brought it down from the cabinet.  Creepy, dirty, finger-up-the-nose or in-the-ass fingers must have touched it today, and I forgot to re-wash what was supposed to have been an already clean bowl.  Ugh.  I'm dying, and it's all because people downstairs have no concept of personal hygiene.  Tomorrow I'm going to do something I never thought I'd actually ever HAVE to do- buy a stash of plastic bowls, plates, cups, and utensils.  Unfuckingbelieveable.
I haven't left my room since I came home from work, but I can tell Her Majesty just came home.  No, I didn't see her pull into the driveway, and I don't have a sixth sense or clairvoyance.  I can feel the walls and floors shaking from her ritual cabinet slamming, even though I have my radio on and am sitting directly in front of an oscillating fan.  This is something that I must get off my chest.  In her ever-present need to draw attention to herself, Her Majesty routinely opens and SLAMS every cabinet door in the kitchen.  And unlike an obessive compulsion where she might open each one just to be "even", she opens all of them, SLAMS all of them, and repeats this until either someone walks into the kitchen or she realizes that no one will.  If that doesn't get her attention, she'll start opening and slamming doors.  I have heard this slamming continue for lengths exceeding 5 minutes.  The worst part is that my room is right over the kitchen, so naturally I'm inclined to believe she does this just to fuck with me.  Always one to give the benefit of the doubt, I've gone downstairs and experimented with the cabinet doors.  Perhaps they could be rusty or spring loaded or not close all the way unless you slam them shut.  Alas, I found they are in perfect working order and only require the slightest push of air to close.  If someone sneezed in the other room, I believe the cabinet doors would close.  Can I just tell you how fucking ANNOYING it is to wake up every morning at 7 a.m., not to my gentle, bubbling brook alarm, but to SLAM! SLAM! SLAM! over and over again.  I realize I may not be the quietest person in the morning, but I am amiss to find a legitimate reason for this chorus of cabinets every fucking morning.  And for a woman who doesn't cook or clean, I have to wonder what the fuck she's doing in the cabinets at all.  Oh yeah, trying to fuck with me.
I just had the single-most enlightening conversation I've ever been privvy to in my 20+ years on this earth.  Her Majesty:  "We should get one of those thingies you stick the thingy in.  What do you think?"  Me:  "I'm not really sure what you're talking about."  HM:  "You know, the thingies.  It goes in the thingy to make the computer work."  Me:  "Um..."  HM:  "The THINGY. Oh, come on.  You know.  They sell it at the place.  There's one on the highway.  They sell batteries."  Me:  (stifling contemptuous laughter) "Um..."  HM:  "I got my mom her thing that she ties around her neck there.  It goes in her ear s
