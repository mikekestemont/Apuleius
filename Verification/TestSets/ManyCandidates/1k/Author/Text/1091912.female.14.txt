Anyway I'm trying to be a more quiet and less mean person. Although that may be quite impossible...ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.  Number One on To-Do List: Get a tagboard up.   I think the band idea is good. Only if everyone is willing to commit. Then we gotta find a place and a time too. I think it will be fun...as long as everyone contributes. Wheehoo.   I take mardi to mean monday and mercredi to mean tuesday? what language is that, greek? (hahaha)  yes, friday! i shall take the liberty to post details! well we end school at 2 PM earliest...hoping nothing goes wrong with our progress reports AGAIN...we'll go to Suntec or Great World City (as they are more ulu places and we'll have more of the place to ourselves) to watch Shrek2, The Day After Tomorrow, Troy (again) or whatever movie that looks favourable. Okay? Can't wait.  And...I love that pic of us!! It's, wow, RECENT!! Hahahaha. Now everyone can see why we're the rectangular table of ladies. Plus I love the cups and the one ton of mee bowl there. HEEHEE.
