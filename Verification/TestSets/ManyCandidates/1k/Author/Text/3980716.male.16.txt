I love you so much, and it's only your first day since you've been gone, and you have 5 more days to go, and I can't wait. So much has happened since the wreck yesterday and I'm about to go over to my grandma's house to cook and eat some hamburgers over there with her and my brother (had to force my brother to go.) I just want you to know,  AHHHHHHHH I MISS YOU MORE THAN ANYTHING AND I'M GOING CRAZY WITHOUT YOU!!!! AHHHH some more!! AHHHHH . We talked like the last few hours before you left, and I loved everrrrrrrrrrryyyyyyyyyyy minute of it! You talked on voice chat most of the time and I  LOVE  your  voice! Baby! ... I just also wish I could have seen you before you left. I'm glad we had that talk because now I feel closer than ever and I'm sooo happy. Everything is going great over here and I hope it is going great over there! Don't go and find some guy while out there lol. I would never do that I'm sure you wouldn't either! Well like I said you can delete this post cause I'm posting in here and stuff lol.   I Love you soooooooooooooooooooOOO much baby,   [  J o S e P h  ]   :-* >:D
[. This WHOLE post is for Joe..- Baby! I'm sorry I got mad at you for NOTHING. You could have been hurt in that wreck, and I would have been CRUSHED..at how I got angry at you..over stupid shit. You have your own friends, and I can't be first in yr life ALL the time. I'm just PMSing and stuff. I wanna let you know how much you mean to me before I go off. I hope you don't find some other girl who has SOCOM ll..=p. I'd like..be so pissed at you lol. And I'm not gonna cry about the whole wreck thing, or how ..in shock.. I would be if you had been hurt...IM NOT CRYING!..lol..im not..You can never drive again..especially when I'm at Miami this week..I dun wanna come home to the news of you being hurt..or dead..or w/e..-SIGH- Now I'm forever going to be worried about you. I never thought anything could happen to you before because , I dunno..I just didn't. And now..I'm preparing myself to lose you..which is gay..-whacks self- Maybe its like..a natural instinct for me..who the hell knows lol. I'm sorry Imma not write more..or sign it..lol..I just wanna talk to youuuu......I LOVE YOU!.]
..Hey. I'm all alone. xD Joe's on Socom ll talking to Hawk..they're doing something I can't be included in. Heh.&nbsp; I dunno, but whenever Joe and Hawk get together, I feel left out. It's not them, it's me and my idiotic self. xD Dan didn't get on today..Haven't spoken to Art in awhile. He's prolly doing Lou..xD Awhness. I think I have a fever. I can't believe I'm leaving tomorrow..I'm kinda nervous about it..scared when I come back , things are going to be different. A lot different. Joe hasn't said anything yet..Maybe I should talk, but I don't wanna sound pissy. Lol. I'm hopeless..I wonder what he's doing. It must be nice..not having me tagging along..and sucking. xD w00tage. Today's post was short, and I'm not bothering with making it pretty or signing and stuff. Peace out.
[.I know it's been two days, and I apologize, but of course I will make up for it with tonight's post. Tonight, we shall talk about love, or what I think is love..Mmks..here goes. -dun lemme sound corny God, dun lemme sound corny xD- .] .::I'm not sure about you, but I don't think I could go on forever without love. I look at some people who are around eighty years old and never have a husband or wife..I don't understand how they make it honestly. How can you wake up and see no one beside you? Hear no one snoring..xD? How can you eat alone..dance alone..sing alone..get older alone..die alone?..If there's one thing I think I honestly NEED to survive, it's love. Maybe it's cuz I'm young and stupid and think I'll fall apart If I don't have someone to tell me I'm pretty all the time. -rolls eyes- Whatever! SCREW YOU! lol. I know what I want and need and you do not. -gives you the finger..lol jk- Anyways..ahem..lol..Love seems so great, so..I dunno..beautiful? Lol. Look, I'm trying my HARDEST not to sound totally QUEER! lol. Bare with me. =p I just wonder if anyone..can honestly..ever love me. Like, What if no one will ever fall in love with me?..What if I wasn't made to be with someone?..What if I'll be one of those old ppl I mentioned?=o That'd S
