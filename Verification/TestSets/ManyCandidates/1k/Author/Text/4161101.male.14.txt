2day morning went to the interview at NJC. Bad thing i kena problematic teachers, ask those qu i must tink very hard one. Sad case ah my one. First thing he ask is wat am i passionate about. I also dun noe wat to say man, jus cock up somethings so can survive n dun malu myself. Aiya looks lyk i will stay in SJI. This interview is 50%, better start praying.........   Btw i ve change the blog template. No idea y some of my blog template went missing, must reset everything, aiya hen ma fan leh.
Another day has pass, aiya looks lyk final year exam coming soon lao, 4 more weeks to go. Hear the word FYE has oredi made me very sian lao. Dun feel lyk studying leh, but nvm la once in a while work hard for exam will do some good. Wat more can i comment on, this year streaming lao, try to make it into a good class n also hope my IP interview is a success. Anyway the main reason i choose IP cause its challending, better than currently SJI one. SJI next year take 9 subject, NJ take double the amount. Actually double the amount also ok one la, except that i will be more busy n the workload jus piles on.
Aiya go 2 sch u will find endless sorrows. 2day morning i received a shocking news, suddenly i was told tt theres training today. The NCO r very pro leh, 2day den tell me. Lucky today no much things to do except programming n history test tomolo. BTW tomolo my teacher is finally returning to sch. After a whole week of sleeping in class finally going down 2 some serious preparation for e final year. Actually truthfully speaking, i thought it is gonna be a few months more. Then 2day i realised i have 5 weeks. OMG but nvm la, jus live life as normal haha.
Now life in sch is very sian n cham. The lesson so sian until i almost fel asleep. The teacher also mark very slow, since last Wed the sci common test now the teacher havent mark finish yet. Wa lao wat the crap is this, teacher slacking. Other teachers mark finish lao give back le she still havent finished. OMG next time get this type of teacher exam fail le. Tomolo still got Chinese Test, aiya comfirm fail lao, better pray i score if not si lao. Then Fri history text. (*sigh) The teachers are very clever, put two test which need a lot of memory work together. How to handle, but nv la, i got my way of handling this type of things. Hope the holidays come soon, then can really relax.
2day got 2 go for fencing course. aiya, very sian. Other than learning somethings about fencing, its quite a waste of time. The whole time go there n slack. But this is better than training. Go there for 2 hours just to relax n learn a bit on how to fence. The best part is the demo match, then the rest is like very boring. Learning how 2 move front n back . Actually prefer 2 do others things than this. The worts of all, after course i have to write a report, omg, i really dun noe wat to write. Must get my "facts" rite man, got to write a ns report. Oh well, life lyks tt.
2day a knooty problem surface. I received a letter form NJC saying i short-listed to go for e interview. Quite shock actually, i though i would flung my 2nd test. Now i have to make two choice. one: stay in SJI, two: go NJC for IP. If i leave i will disappoint quite a no. of ppl. First, my cca teachers would be sad. They r counting on me to win the next campcraft com plus lead the unit. Some of my frens will also be sad to c me go, lyk Ben Huang, whole day calling me to fail my test. (*sigh). Looks lyk my fate lies here. If i leave, hope that my teachers can understand. The thing tt i will miss is my cca, taught me many things n also made quite a lot of frens. If i could return for cca i definitely will return.
2day after sepak takraw com me n my frens went bowling at cdan. Oh sad case man, only got 34 points!(Ahhhhhh) Now i noe bowling is not tt easy after all. Quite a number of shots went down the drain. Oh well looks lyk i need more partice. After tt i went 2 watch the air rifle com. Louis was a professional. Almost every shot was near the bull's eye. Wat i cant believe is that ACSI team can shot 1623 out of 1800 (Kena Shock: 1623!!!!). This means trt every target must be at least 8 or 9 to score that. OMG thats almost impossible loh unless u r in the air rifle team. Anyway i saw quite a few ppl who r also very good. A gal from nygh in the first lane did quite well. I have to leave at 4 so could not watch the whole competition. All i can is pray that we win.( Hope so cause Mr Goh will wish we win :) )
Today i went for the Prefect interview. The first thing that the HOL told me when i went for the interview: "I believe you applied for IP program." Then the next thing he told me: "To be a prefect you have to be loyal to the school. You have the qualities and your results are good. Im not questioning you about your loyality but just to let you know that if you became a prefect someone else cant be."This struck me. Should i be a prefect or not. If i became a prefect, then i ought to saty in SJI. This concern about my future so i have to decide carefully. If i want to stay, i will want to be a
