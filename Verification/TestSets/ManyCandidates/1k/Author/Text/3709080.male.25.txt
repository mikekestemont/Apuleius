Wow what a weekend!!! these 2 days have been really different....u know what; it was a really hectic weekend.seeing films on channels and co-ordinating between channels is some issue.u guys who are not into seeing films wont understand that. its so tiring...but i managed it..kudos..Nothing much were happening other than seeing films..on sunday myself and my two roomies went to an italian restaurant.it was vjs treat for making it successfully to his job..it is always a nice treat as long as someone else is paying.. but half of the time we spend on the road looking for shanks 64mb memory card which he lost on the way...  well tomorrow is my last day at the company..shall i say i should declare tomorrow as my independence day?? 30th june-2004...well from next year onwards 30th june will b celebrated as independence day..i will try to make a great speech tomorrow just as presidents of countries do...really speaking i dont have a clue as to where i am going after this...next week onwards people will start asking me "hey jay what r u doing? where are u working now?" ..thats a question which has a high probability of pissing me off..can i say i work at ur #$%^ home..? that would be like insulting them..so i have found a way out of it..i will wear my institute T-shirt and blazer from next week onwards when ever i go out.so that if somebody asks me this question i will show him my blazer and T..so he will think i am doing something at the Institute..wow i am so intelligent..y cant others understand that...?  my friend guru has another proposition to his not getting job.he thinks he is so good that nobody wants him..thats a bit too much..but i consoled him by saying that he is not at all good as he thinks .... :-).i think he was "happy" hearing that...well goto go now...hope u all guys have a wonderfull day..will be back with my independence day speech tomorrow if i get time...  something to think abt before i signoff..i was reading thru this website called neoworld.com (dont know wether the spelling is correct).its managed by a guy from princeton.it says that centre of gravity concept was not invented but it was disovered. as it already was there when god created females..and the reason he gives is "if  CoG was not there then how could girls with big assets ( ) balance themselves,, even winning 100ms???..well that is indeed a good argument right?? god help him great day ahead...byeee.
well these 2 days have been without much difference...same life ...why i say not much difference is that everything is happening as per schedule..yesterday i got one reject from a firm to which i applied..that proves life is going normal....but the sad part is that i have got loads of work at office.because of my fooling around at office for 3 months not doing anything, now i am faced with the horrendous task of completing a huge database to be made out of macros,pivot tables etc and that too in 3 days flat.now thats a bit too much to take...but no way out...i know i cant complet the task and my boss is already rehearsing the abuses that he has to shower on me but my ambitious and positive nature makes me dream of completing the task and becoming a great person at Philips where i am doing the project....  i know i am very good...infact excellent ...y i say is because, i am able to convey in very clear words that i am not good for nothing thru my resume...so that the companies could reject me easily..in that sense i am very good for "nothing"..there is a famous saying by charles anderson that "the greatest investment of any company is its youth" but that doesnt seem to work here in singapore as all companies are looking for experienced oldies...in one way i am in an infinite matrix...ok an infinite matrix is something which has a moving point as locus.so where ever that point moves or goes a matrix will be formed around it...i am such a point...with an infinite matrix of "disastor" around me...  okkie so cya later ..meanwhile do check out this blog ...its very informative..written by one mayur goyal...http://informist.net/collage.html..nice one....  uncertainity rules!!!
Its been a hectic life yesterday..i had loads of work to do at office and as usual i didnt do a thing :). Instead i drifted myself around reading blogs and BBC news. There is this guy from IIMK in india ,preethesh, who writes good blogs. According to me blogs are meant to be funny, simple and readable. But instead most people use blogs to show their command over English.This guy ,preethesh, writes so nicely and in a simple way that feels really good to read it..and just as kid waiting for choclates i wait for his blogs.... well when i look back upon the 24 hrs past, i think i advanced myself a bit. there were 2 things that were troubling me. one was ,lack of job and another one accomodation.. both have seen improvements( shall i say like that)in the last 24 hrs. My friend suddenly called me up and invited me to use his room for one month as he is leaving for india for vacation and he offered to pay half of that months rent ..wow...cool..are people so crazy?? or am i such a valued possession to keep..hehe anyway that problem is solved.he is indeed a nice guy..i look forward to staying with him..   second is the job..i got one more reject...thats great..that means life is normal (it become abnormal if i get a call)...but to be honest i luv these moments in my life as i feel this as a cross road of my life..and its testing how much i can stand this long given uncertainity.. i have been thru comforts all the way till now ...but now i am living life as it should be... good..if there were a beutifull girl also to share this wonderfull abnormality i
