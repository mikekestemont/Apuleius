i want to go watch Harold &amp; Kumar again....
JustADr34m3r: This is Josh's mom and I am also a responsible adult and it was decided that we would not be going to gencon this year since it is the opening day of school and also he is playing football..&nbsp; So i must apologize because he can not go this year.&nbsp; Sorry.
backstory:    in two weeks, we were supposed to be going to ohio and moving my sister back home because she's coming back for 3 years of college.... so she can become a teacher.&nbsp; or something, i don't know the whole story.    current story:    so yesterday at like 10am my sister called my mom and demanded that we come this weekend instead, so my mom gets all the plans set and we leave around 2.&nbsp; After a very long, boring trip (with me sleeping on the floor of the van) we eventually made it to Ohio.    the trip there:    so I was sitting there tired of the dog scratching to sit on my lap, so I went into the back (we took out the seats) and sat on the floor.&nbsp; I pulled out Joe's Patented Duct Tape-Box-o-Rama and played a quick game of Premiere Smackdown WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO-Perstar vs. Team Anal.&nbsp; After&nbsp;a quick beating, I decided to build a new deck out of the cards I had in JPDTBOR and the 2 binders I had with me.&nbsp; I built Underedge.&nbsp; So the deck sucks, but it was something to do on the ride down.&nbsp; Flair 2nd or 3rd turned it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I slept for quite a bit of the way, too.&nbsp; My grandma was driving the lead vehicle (there were 2 vanss, my dad and myself in one and my mom and grandma in the other).&nbsp; We were following her, and she doesn't speed.&nbsp; At all.&nbsp;&nbsp; She needs to learn how to speed so the 7 hour trip is only 5 hours next time, like normal.    arrival in fairfield, oh:    so we arrive around 9CST 10EST and we go to her apartment.&nbsp; they're all down and shit cuz she's leaving, so we kinda just talk for a little bit, they go to a hotel and we chill in their apartment.&nbsp; me=couch, grandma=futon, mom&dad=their bed.&nbsp; aqua teen wasn't on.&nbsp; no aqua teen = no happyness.&nbsp; bitches.    the morning after:    we pack up the vans, and get ready to depart.&nbsp; after a sobby-30-minute goodbye we get on the road, and go eat at Frisch's Big Boy.&nbsp; I don't know why they call it that, when the food isn't that "big".&nbsp; We get on the freeway, and make our first stop in Shelbyville, IN a.k.a. Hell!!!    Shelbyville:    Shelbyville has never been good to us Wisconsinites.&nbsp; One of the first times my sister ever went to Ohio, her car broke down in Hell.&nbsp; The people here are bastard asses and should all be killed.&nbsp; This time, it's where all tha " drama " happens.   &nbsp;   tha drama:   So, my sister pulled in front of my grandma, and we pulled into a gas station called Big Foot.&nbsp; She's like "i have to go to the bathroom".&nbsp; She goes to the bathroom.&nbsp; I take the dog to go piss in the grass.&nbsp; Sara decides she feels bad leaving her job.&nbsp; Roight.&nbsp; Her job.&nbsp; *wink wink*&nbsp; So she grabs her clothes and heads back after a nice half hour "Make the right decision" talk.&nbsp; *sigh*&nbsp; Here comes uncomfort.   uncomfort:   What's so uncomfortable about this?&nbsp; There's only 2 seats open in the van, and one is the drivers.&nbsp; the dog  was  supposed to be w/ my sister, but she's not coming back.&nbsp; and she's not keeping our dog.&nbsp; so the dog has to ride with us.&nbsp; we clear off a spot on the futon in the back and I get a nice long 7 hour car ride SQUISHED INTO A GOD DAMNED MOTHER FUCKING BALL.&nbsp; Un-fucking-comfort.   the ride back:   did I mention I   HATE   Indiana?&nbsp; The people there suck, it's damned boring, and it stole Gencon.&nbsp; Let's not rant about that.&nbsp;&nbsp; I slept quite a bit on the way back.&nbsp; It was uncomfortable.&nbsp; I better not continue or I'll keep bitching more and more.   now:   in two weeks my sister is driving up here.&nbsp; yay.   post.over
