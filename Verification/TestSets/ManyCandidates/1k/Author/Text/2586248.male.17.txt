Hey, I uploaded the roll that I shot at Georgetown IR last week. Some fun pictures and I took a bunch of Avi for some reason. He's so photogenic. You can get them at  urlLink http://photos.yahoo.com/lazybum99 .&nbsp;However, the collection of pictures is nothing compared to the one Marco has with Ireney. His collection is at:  urlLink http://countyseat.net/marco/Gallery/Georgetown/index.htm    Here's one of Marco and Ireney dancing, as Jinnyn's brother looks on in bewilderment:   .   &nbsp;  Classic.
I thought Bill Clinton's speech was absolutely terrific (of course). He hit on all the right points and wore the same tie that I have. Check out  urlLink http://www.dems2004.org  for videos, and definitely check out Ted Kennedy's also. Bush-bashing supposedly discouraged? Psssh. Edwards will be great tonight, I'm sure, and I was just watching Kerry in Charlestown Navy Yard, on his way to the convention. I'm at work until nine tonight, so I have catch the convention online (streaming live) at the site above. I hope I don't bother the patrons too much.  I realize that all conventions are basically mutual-admiration societies, but for the Democrats, that hasn't always been an easy task. However, everyone from George Mitchell to Gephardt to Brokaw is saying that they have never seen the party so united. I've always believed that a more united Democratic base (moreso than a united Republican base) will help the candidate prevail.  Oh, and how about Barack Obama! Check an AP story out at  urlLink http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/national/AP-CVN-Obama-Keynote.html &nbsp;if you've never heard of him (DON'T FORGET-- registering for the New York Times is always free and most definitely worth it!) He's another idol of mine in the Democratic Party. Check him out.
Gmail is an outstanding email service, and not just because it's provided by Google. It gives you an entire 1 GB of storage (1000 MB), allowing you to exchange music, large attachments, etc. with each other. It's worth it -- it's not directly open to the public yet, but I have five invitations left. If you would like one, IM me or email me.   http://gmail.google.com
There is a real problem in Sudan right now-- it goes beyond the classification of problem and since the United States is of a more indifferent attitude to issues irrelevant to direct national security, most people don't know and thus the government is less hesitant. Criticize Clinton for failing to act in Rwanda (which is wholly justified as I hope all people realize), but don't sit back now and watch the people of Darfur hopelessly crumble in another genocide. Read more about it at The New York Times, one of the few media players that is extensively covering this tragedy:  - Here are stories in the past month--  urlLink http://query.nytimes.com/search/query?query=darfur&amp;date=past30days  - Nicholas Kristof's personal accounts--  urlLink http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2004/07/06/opinion/20040707_KRIS_1.html   &nbsp;  &nbsp;
I found out about this organization while at Boys State. Although they kinda stole an idea I had (I'm sure unintentionally), they promote young voter awareness across the country. Although they won't state it, it inevitably supports a Democratic viewpoint-- but check them out at  urlLink http://www.freedomsanswer.net .   They do good work and it's real easy to get involved.
Hey everyone,  Yes, this is my new blog -- considering the last one was kind of neglected, I just decided to start up another one. I'll try to keep it up to date, add tidbits, but not commit to writing a lot everyday, just when I see fit.   I just got back from Georgetown IR program and I'll be posting some pictures, hopefully later today. Boys State was great, and that was in early July. The Marines -- crazy. Tonight is the third night of the convention, and John Edwards is speaking tonight. You can probably tell that for the next hundred days or so, my blog will be consumed with election news. I'll stick this in my AIM profile, let me know what you think, if you have any suggestions, and if you were at Georgetown IR, sned some mor epictures-- Courtney, that means you! And Marco, stick this on your site man. (Marco is absolutely one of the coolest guys I have ever met, check out his website at countyseat.net/marco/home.html)   If you need the notes from Georgetown IR, thank Edward first (philo4audio) and then go to  urlLink http://itg.no-ip.org . Thank God for Edward -- the notes will definitely help in your history/gov't class. Alright, until later when I stick up the photos, have a good day.
The convention just ended and here's my opinion on the speech:  It was as good as John Kerry could give it-- he's no Bill Clinton, but he's not a George W. Bush either. He spoke from his heart, from his mind, and gave his vision to this nation. And he makes me proud to be a Democrat.   If you want reactions from around the world, from newspapers from here to Thailand, check out  urlLink this.
Avi aka Avinash aka reeeeally slow walker  Here is Avi, on the left, with Marco:    As you can tell from the picture, Avi is a rather fun-loving guy. He likes having fun--whether it's blowing his mouth up and holding up two fingers or stalking people, Avi is a great guy. Interesting, yet absurdly true, story:  First day in Georgetown. We, as a group of about seven or eight, are walking down M Street. Two people on bicylces are heading towards us. Everyone moves over, to let them pass. Except Avi. The first person on the bike, a black woman, is dangerously approaching. Avi, apparently now recognizing that there will be a crash if he does not move, dashingly throws out his hands, puts them on the lady's handlebars, and says defiantly but oddly nonchalantly, "Stop."  Avi can also trick you, as Marco found out-- first afternoon in Georgetown. They go to play basketball. Marco hardly plays, and he doesn't know much about Avi yet. Avi suggests they play Horse, and promptly misses every practice shot. Marco gains confidence, thinking, "All right, I can handle this dude." Game begins. Avi promptly swishes every shot.  I hope this gives you an idea about Avi -- he's a great g
