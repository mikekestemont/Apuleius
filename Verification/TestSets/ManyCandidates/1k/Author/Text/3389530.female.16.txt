yesterday i bought my sister's birthday prezzie... i can't wait to see the grin on her face as she opens it :D  ZAPP'S HOME!!!! *dances ab00t* he came home this morning, and apart from some very suspect fur-shaving (which makes him look curiously like a poodle) you'd hardly notice he'd had anything wrong with him. he is as cute, and lovely, and meowingly in-your-face as ever :)  i can't really be bothered to type much now. we are about to have a picnic dinner in t'garden. so mebbe i'll be back later...
well, yesterday was fun. i was sorting through all my old cards and letters as part of a HUGE (and i mean huge - i threw out 4 full binbags of stuff) sort-out of my room which has hardly been changed since... a long time ago. my room was looking absolutely spiffy so i thought i'd make it that extra bit spiffy by sorting some more. and guess what? an unexpected windfall in the shape of a ten pound note - a christmas gift from my nanny which i'd evidently forgotten to take out of the card. so that was nice.  also  yesterday i was rummaging under my wardrobe and came across a dearly beloved t shirt that i thought i'd lost years ago. it was a tad dusty... fluffy, in fact, but a wash sorted that. not a lot else happened yesterday. i took the dog for a walk, and the park was really nice. usually it's full of gangs but because it was during school time there was no one there, so scamp could wander freely, as dogs are wont to do...  the vet says zapp may be able to come home this weekend. he got hit by a car last sunday night, came back to us on monday morning all bloody and muddy. rushed him off to the vet and he's been there since. he was incredibly lucky - nothing was broken, he wasn't injured badly at all, but for the fact that his entire chin had been scraped completely off his jaw and was dangling, so to speak. the vet said he'd never seen a cat so lucky. anyway, apparently he's doing well, and we may be able to have him back soon... can't wait.  my sister's birthday's on monday. she's 13, which is scary. i remember when i was 13, i was like "omg, i'm like, a teenager now". i'm going to get her a gamecube game that she really wants - metroid prime. i love spoiling my sister. nanny gave me £400 for my world challenge (more on that later) fund which enabled me to pay the final cheque and have a few hundred pounds left over, so i can afford to be generous :)  ok, world challenge. it's this thing, where about 20 of us from my school save up £3000 each to go to south africa for a month this summer. we'll be hiking, trekking, camping, canoeing, that kind of stuff, and also do a community project in a village somewhere in the middle of nowhere. the point is to 'empower' us, if you will, so we raised all the money ourselves and while we're there, although there will be adults with us, they're not allowed to make any decisions - we have to. i can't wait, i've been saving every penny for 2 years and now it's finally time. i'm going to be the leader on my 16th birthday *grins* also this summer... when my exams have finished me and six friends are going youth hostelling for a week in the lake district, no adults. to be honest, i'm looking forward to that more than south africa - i've been arguing a lot with my parents recently and any opportunity to be away from them, and with my friends, must be good.  wow, that was a long entry. maybe i'll go upstairs now and 'revise' (ha!) for my business studies exam at 1. or maybe i'll doodle. who knows...
well well well. here we have... my blog. i didn't actually realise this site existed but for the people in my neopets guild, who all seem to have blogs... so, like a sheep, i'm getting one too :D today has been rather nice, actually, even though i had my german listening gcse exam this morning. it was  so  easy; way easier than anything we'd done in class. which was a relief, naturally. so i'm back at home now, meant to be revising for my case study business studies exam tomorrow, but of course i'm not - i'm on neopets, as ever. hey-ho.  the weather's suddenly turned rather manky. i hope it doesn't rain, as i will probably be sent to walk the dawg later on. tea and bakewells are nice.  how's that for a first post? really... landmarky, and all that crap.
had the school leavers' service yesterday. our school's meant to be church of england, so we have cathedral services every now and then where all the teachers go on about god (who i personally don't believe in, but then that is another blog) and we sit in stupified silence. yesterday we said goodbye to about 20 members of our year (most o' the dropouts, unsurprisingly) and year 13. it wasn't really sad - none of my friends are leaving.  today, went to choir in the morning. i really like choir, singing's one of the things i'm really good at. i'm an alto, and there's only about 5 of us, so you have to sing really bigly (shuddupiknowit'snotaword) and it's good :)  came to tom's afterwards... drank tea... got him in trouble... watched men in black 2 and mooched. i am, in fact, still here now. a boring sunday awaits... i may consider working on this help site thingy for neopets.  i really like neopets, kinda sad i know, and yet... it's rather addictive. i'm going to make a site not just to join all the other websites out there which offer information on everything and anything neopets, but one to introduce e
