About 6 months ago I was standing inside the Hi-Pointe theater and saw this strange movie poster for a film titled "Bubba Ho-Tep".  I knew I'd have no chance of seeing it in St. Louis because we only get the big budget pieces of crap that Hollywood shoves down your throat for your "enjoyment."  We get the occasional art-house or indie film picture, but not the amount that we should have. Anyway, I forgot about this poster until I was browsing through Blockbuster recently looking for anything that would be interesting and I happened to see the reduced version of the poster I had seen many months ago.  I'm sure you're asking yourself right now, "What the hell is this all about?"  Here's a quick synopsis of the film:   Elvis is alive and living in a retirement home in Texas.  Another of the residents is a black man who believes he is JFK.  The two have to team up to stop a mummy from ancient Egypt from sucking the souls out of their fellow residents.   That was enough for me to want to find out what this was all about, and then I discovered that Bruce Campbell (star of the "Evil Dead" series) played Elvis.  I realized that I HAD to see this film.  I'm not going to tell you any more about the movie.  I'd be spoiling it for you.
So I was looking at some websites, clicking on links that were there, and I clicked this blogger link.  After looking around at it I decided to use this to my advantage and make my own damn webpage.  And here it is! I didn't want to go too flashy, because it's not me and I don't know how.  Posts won't be much more than a thought I may have had that day or news about me.  Hence the name of the page: Krap.   For today there isn't much.  I'm wasting time because I'm supposed to be writing a short essay for my English class this summer and cleaning my room so a realtor can start showing my house to potential parties.  What no one knows yet though is that I'm part of the deal:  You buy the house, you get a tenant that lives in your basement, pays no rent, and eats your food.
During one of my late nights of boredom I was sitting on my couch watching MTV and this weird looking band came on.  Weird as in an AV-room-kind-of-way from high school.  I check out the little description in the corner and their name is Coheed & Cambria.  If anybody knows what this means I'd like to know.  The song was called "A Favor House Atlantic," again explanation would be appreciated.  They start playing and it's just another Emo band.  Then the singer, a slightly overweight Iranian-looking guy with long stringy hair, opens his mouth.  At this point I laid my head back and stared at the ceiling pondering what made the bobble-head doll craze what it became when the voice I heard sounded was Geddy Lee's.  This voice is not easily copied so I quickly looked back at the screen to see if MTV came to their senses and started playing a Rush video instead.  Nope, same band and same weird looking singer.  Being the curious little monkey that I am I looked them up and found that not only does the lead singer sound like Lee but they have a song entitled "2113".  Obviously the similarity in the voices wasn't missed on the band.  I've listened to a few of their songs, it's not bad but not exactly Rush.  Check 'em out if you wish (click post title).  I was just bored and thought this would be a good post topic.
I was checking out this  urlLink website I like to look at every once in awhile pertaining to video games and a comic strip  when I found this  urlLink link .  It's a music video for some techno that is based on the old theme song from Trans Formers.  It stars Soundwave, the giant Decepticon boombox, and a tape that shoots out of his chest.  If you don't remember him you will once you start watching it and remember the old show.  It takes a long ass time to load so be patient and make yourself a sandwich to eat while watching it.
Tonight I set upon the task of transferring a bunch of files from my old computer to the new.  I had no idea how many files I had that I didn't want to get rid of yet.  Most of them stupid pictures that I'll eventually get rid of.  I had a lot of writing to copy over too.  Not having a CD burner on that old computer made it a bitch to copy all of that stuff too.  Many trips back and forth with little diskettes.  Anyway, I came across this short I had written a while back.  I wish I could remember when I did it because when I read it tonight I was surprised I had written anything this good.  Not that I'm patting myself on the back or anything, I just really like the thing.  It touches a cord, as some say.  I'm sure some of you have seen this but I'm going to post it anyway:  	The yellows and oranges, splashes of red and greens, that’s what I see at my feet.  Colors so often seen in nature at this time.  The leaves cover the sidewalk and the bench space next to me.  Creating a sunset for the ground, one to walk on and to know what it is to be a part of something beautiful.  The hills ahead of me, the rolling hills.  With the sunset in front of me, the hills seem to look like waves from the sun, just increasing the awe of the world surrounding me, enveloping me in it’s warmth.   	It’s not that warm though.  I still have to wear a sweater to protect me from the gentle winds.  Winds that blow the paints from t
