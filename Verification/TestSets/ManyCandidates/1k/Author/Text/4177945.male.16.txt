Let me write about last wednesday 18th Aug... Hmm there was suppose to be a  seminar  that day after school.. but unfortunately one of the speakers of the seminar was sick.. so it was cancelled.. most of us was picked to help during the seminars as  ushers,photographers or mcs .. when news was passed that it was cancel,we were so pissed off esp those who had already wore formal clothes to school for the seminar.. so they feel kinda stupid wearing it for nothing.. a good thing i was clever enough to come to school in outside clothes instead of wearing my formal clothes straight from home.. so i wasnt affected that much just that i was so eager to wear the blazer but in the end i was disappointed.. hmm after that me  Joan Peishi Angeline junxiong  Amy  Jane Beeleng and Joanne  went to  Junction 8 .. we all went to the Food Junction first as they were hungry..  me n Junxiong  did not eat as we had ate in school.. after that  Terissa  meet us there..  Amy's  middle finger had a cut.. so i went to buy  Pooh plasters at Watson .. hope she felt betta as she like Pooh.. haha..  Jane   and Peishi  went off first as the rest of us accompany  Terissa  to  Mos burger  coz she had not eaten the whole day.. after that we wasted lots of time at there.. we could not decide where we wanna go.. In the end we decided to go to  Little Guilin .. haha.. of all places..  Joanne Beeleng and Joan  did not follow us as they were busy.. So only left  Terissa Angeline   Amy   Jun xiong and me .. haha cant believe they bought  Vodka  to drink during daylight.. Crazy.. Coz of that also  Amy  got hurt as she tried to open the bottle cap of  Junxiong's  drink.. 3 of her fingers on her left hand was cut..i felt like  razorblades  pierce through my heart the moment she was cut.. we quickly help her wash her wound.. fortunately i bought those  Pooh plasters  earlier on.. so 3 of her fingers had plasters on.. haha so cute..after that we had a fun and relaxing time there..had lots of laughter.. we saw a  couple making out  there like noones business.. also saw  a guy  so enthusiastic trying to fish there.. and we made lots of  jokes about the lake and the tortoises .. hahaha.. We also made a name for our group.. we call ourselves 'The GLG sickos'.. muahaha.. perfect name for all of us who are sickos..End of the day , we had a great time there.. Lots of interaction.. we went off at 7pm.. i went straight home.. i slept that day while worrying about her fingers.. Seeing her hurt is like  Razorblades  cutting me up...
Hmm was kinda busy in pass few days to write about the things that have been happening.. only post songs on my blog.. I'm still kinda busy so i'm cutting my history short.. hmm a strange and confusing thing happened.. i found out that  dilys  actually told   Amy  and terissa  that i was sad for the past few days because i was rejected by  diyana .. and these Fu*king lies could only have come from  diyana  herself.. wats up wif making those tales.. God, i didnt offend them in any way.. wats their motive.. i'm still wondering.. btw i just have to say it..  Amy    is the one i like n beginning to love her for who she is..even if she doesnt.. and i was utterly shocked that dilys told her that.. wats up.. are they trying to ruin my hope of getting her.. even if so.. wats their purpose.. dont tell me  diyana  likes me.. thats impossible.. i'm too low for her.. she got lots of other suitors.. but whatever it is.. Glad that whoever knows about it does not believe it and never will.. including  Amy..  thank God.. so now i got to warn those two gals.. whatever motive they have in mind, they better forget it before its too late.. i will not take lies lightly especially if its about me.. i've not shown my wrath and i dont want them to be the ones to see it first.. and to all of you out there.. just forget about all evil thoughts u have in mind.. if it have something to do against me.. Trouble is near.. i can be friendly but u won't wanna mess with a  satanic deadknight .. and if you do anything to  Amy .. Hell will break lose. so get down to your own business and leave me alone to lead my life in peace..  Coz Until the day i die, i'll spill my heart for her ... So  F**k off or be F**k ... Peace..   *sory for explicit and violent content*
I may not be the best-looking guy you ever knew   But i can show you love that will always be true   And when your skies turns grey,my love will guide the way   And if these words that i hold can only be told   Saying i love you   Is the hardest thing to do   And if i ever do,Girl i'll always be true   And when your tears fall to the ground   I will pick you up when you're feeling down
I'm not supposed to be scared of anything   But i donnoe where i am   I wish that i could move but i'm exhausted   And nobody understands(how i feel)   I'm trying hard to breathe now   But theres no air in my lungs   There's noone here to talk to   And the pain inside is making me numb      I try to hold this under control   They can't help me coz noone knows         Chorus:   Now i'm going through changes,changes   God,I feel so frustrated lately   When i get suffocated,save me   Now i'm going through changes,changes        I'm feeling weak and weary   Walking through this world alone   Everything you say,every word of it,   Cuts me to the bone(and i bleed)   I've got something to say   But now i've got nowhere to turn   I
