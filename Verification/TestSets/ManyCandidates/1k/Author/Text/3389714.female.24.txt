Woke up today at 6:30am .. fully rested…it been a long time since I got decent sleep.. I think it was all the craziness from the previous few days that finally took a toll on me..but feel I like a million bucks today.. woke up... walk downstairs to find the whole family sitting around the kitchen table enjoying breakfast on… yes u got it on “a bloody WEEKDAY” it was odd.. but nice… mom had to go to work late today ..so she thought with dad’s leg and all she’ll treat us all to a warm breakfast..I honestly hate stuffing my face with cold corn flakes in the morning ..and oatmeal is out of the question it taste like mushed blob to me …however, I passed on the breakfast ..and negotiated my way to making dad iron my khakis.  It worked.. I despise ironing ..i don’t mind washing clothes or folding them just hate ironing .. oh well .. trotted back upstairs and bushed my teeth..took a warm shower today ..had to wash hair…decided to give it a quick blow dry and headed downstairs to pick up my perfectly ironed trousers..mom managed to give a quick yet extremely loud shout stating I was once again drippin on her carpet…I swear I wasn’t..I just think she enjoys clearing her throat every morning by yelling at me ..lets just call it her throat exercise…..Due to today’s unruly weather of humidity and rain..i decided to wear my new tennis jacket with a white tankie.. I actually looked good on me ..wow ..i successfully dressed myself today..yippie.. anyways was havin a awesome hair day ..and I defiantly started the day off with a positive note.. made 2 sandwiches and decided that I’ll get to work on time today..i opened the side door to see mom’s mini-van blockin my car..yell for mom…like usual she was admiring her non-existent garden in the backyard..in which she recently planted seeds..she managed to pull her van out for me ... to now make a quick dash to work…once again did not break record time of 3 min..hit 2 traffic lights..moving forward..got to work on time ..and decided to read emails and savor the silence of an empty office over a cup of tazo chai latte…it was great… wrote a few emails here and there..and my director emailed me cuz he wanted to consult me on creating a tag line for an online dictory..i was shocked ..i was never the marketing kind..i emailed him my 2 cents..hopefully he’ll like it .. did some research on cicadas yesterday ..i know that their hitting the jerzy area ..and I’m totally freaked…I hate those little f*ckers… I mean they come by the millions, and they shed their exoskeletons all over the place then they mate and bloody die ..yah it's a great life ..but hey their so damn messy..and absolutely gross..they're hideously ugly and a total freak of nature if u ask me … I mean if we were goin to be mobbed by pretty butterflies I don’t mind..but these boogers look like a mutated mosquitoes .. damn gross… oh well if yah all are interested in reading up on cicadas you can go to http://cicadamania.com . anyways wow did u watch American idol last night I managed to get in the last 5 min.. I was a bit upset I had my heart set on Diana .. oh well..same thing happened to me last season..i had my heart sent on Clay..and they year before on Justin…oh well I guess I don’t ever agree with the rest of America.. umm .. Had an interesting convo with a friend last night it was quite refreshing.. we talked about the activities I was in during my High Schools days ..it was fun walkin down memory lane.. enjoyed it …Thanks P..anyways better get back to work…talk to yah all tomorrow…tata..
Yesterday was a rough day…felt extremely stress and tired… woke up with a weird feeling that today was not goin to be a pleasant day… Haden’t really touched the editing on the user manual… finished stat analysis and then got assigned a crazy yet tedious project… I didn’t mind.. just hated the fact that it was complicated… I mean you had to check then double check then check once more to make sure u did it right… I hate projects like that… they make u question yourself and the way u think… I guess it sort of like when u leave to go to work and when u down the street you get the notion that u left the door unlocked…so u make a U-turn and go back home to check…u quickly turn the handle and Yep it locked…then u dodge back to your car so u won’t be late to work again…then when u sit down at your desk..u get that feeling again..where u wish u turned the door knob both ways and gave the door a push..just to make sure it was locked… It’s a weird sort of paranoia… oh well…after work…went home ..had to go to the library but got lazy and headed home…dad was sitting on the couch with his leg up on the coffee table … I sort of felt bad… but I think it will do him some good to sit and relax… he’s never relaxed and chilled for as long as I can remember .. he’s like a worker ant… can’t sit still.. anyways… Had a god awful night last night.. sleeping was out of the question.. my mind was working overtime.. and I was beyond upset.. I don’t know y… I was up talking to friends till midnight… and had a blast…once I hung up the phone .. I decided to wash up for bed … came back to my room and got this sense of pure loneliness.. it was the worst feeling ever… I didn’t know what to do.. didn’t want to cry didn’t want to mope around feeling sorry for myself… seeing the room that I resided in made me feel that I lost myself in the p
