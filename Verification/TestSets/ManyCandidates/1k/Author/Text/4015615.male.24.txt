So I got this weird headache. Not the kind of headache that's characterized by numb pounding (like my first sexual experience), instead it's sharp, stabbing pain in my temple...like my first bah-mitvah. That was a reach. Sorry.  I tried not to think about it but every 20 minutes or so it became intensely painful and caused me to grit my teeth in anguish and wait for it to pass. It was like this for about a day or so when my lady convinced me to go to the ER. I have little faith in doctors and so actually driving down to the emergency room is a big move for me...right up there with missing my daily shower. So they shot a few quick questions at me, got my insurance and then threw me in an operation room where a girl holding ice over her eye sat waiting with her mother. The nurse curtly told me to change into a smock and lie down on a very uninviting table. When she left all I could think was, "People have died on this table...people have come here, bleeding and screaming and then they died"  ...  I sat on a chair next to the table and read my book. I listened to the girl and her mother talking but the mother was less intelligible than Mayor Menino on muscle relaxants and I couldn't make out a damn word she was saying. Someone finally came in (not a doctor!) and talked to me about my headache and looked in my ears and eyes. This was proceeded by many 'hmmmm''s and 'let me go read about something...' 20 minutes later and 3 more people 'hmmmming', I was sent out the door with a prescription for Motrin. This is why I hate going to the doctor's.  The headache finally went away but it took plenty of Motrin. As I told Hollywood Rick, this was enough Motrin to anesthesize a leg getting ripped off. Even though I was kinda pissed they just gave me some over the counter crap to take, I was really glad when I woke up the next morning feeling better. I couldn't imagine having to get CAT scans and the like.  Off to Fire Island this weekend with the lady and old Tony is going to be there as well. It'll be like The Flintstones meet the Jetsons or Scoopy Doo meets salmonella.  Hope people got to see Kerry speak last night, it was pretty amazing except for the "hair pollution" slip.
As has been my habit for the past couple weeks, I went out of town for the weekend. This time, I visited my lady's&nbsp;home&nbsp;in Brooklyn, NY&nbsp;since her mom was out of town and it would be a great opportunity to make out with no one to hassle us.   What's more, a Japanese touring company&nbsp;came to Lincoln Center to&nbsp;perform an adaptation of Haruki Murakami's, The Elephant Vanishes. Murakami is my favorite author and non-English word to say besides "fongule" so when my lady surprised me with tickets to this show I surprised her with a hickey the size of Kansas.   The&nbsp;play itself was beyond description; the director who was British, somehow captured Murakami's blend of the mundane with the insane&nbsp;by&nbsp;putting on&nbsp;visually&nbsp;magnificent play. It was all in Japanese with English super-titles but&nbsp;what makes Murakami so great is that his themes can transcend the sometimes superficial East/West culture differences. I didn't get up to wizz once, and those who know me can attest to the impressiveness of this&nbsp;feat.&nbsp;   We finished off the evening with dinner at a fancy downtown eatery and some Die Another Day on cable. All in all it was a lovely day.   That night, however, my lady and I waged another battle of wills in the bed. For weeks I had been kidding her&nbsp;with the inevitable fact that someday, probably someday soon, one of us would fart&nbsp;while asleep&nbsp;and the other would be awake to hear it. Now, regardless of the fact that girls don't flatulate or poop, this situation seemed to cause my lady some concern. I reassured her that with my high fiber, no-nonsense diet that I would, in fact, be the first one to break the olfactory/aural silence. Regardless, we've both been sleeping less and waking up more often lately and that night when I woke at 6 for another wazz she has migrated into a different&nbsp;room in the apartment.   I know a girl who trained her boyfriend to leave the room ANYTIME he had to fart. Even at night. Then again, my father says that the true test of&nbsp;a relationship is subjecting someone to the Dutch Oven after drinking a couple beers. I promise I'll let everyone know when the cease fire is ended.   Lastly,&nbsp;while walking out of my lady's father's apartment I noticed a small wooden scroll type thing nailed on the doorframe. I asked&nbsp;if this was a Jewish doorbell. She&nbsp;scoffed at my&nbsp;Wasp/Wop&nbsp;ignorance and corrected me by saying it was a Mizuzala (sp?). OK, now I love the Chosen People and all but where are these words coming from? I swear they make them up on the spot to confuse us and then laugh about it in their world-financial headquarters 50 miles under the earth's surface.   Keep it comin', sucka!!!
I've just done 100 pushups. I didn't want to but my friend,  urlLink Tony &nbsp;urged me to do it.&nbsp; What's more, he finally bullied me into starting a blog again. So my atrophied chest and writing skills are&nbsp;now aching as I try to flex them again.   Some background: I'm a 24 year-old grad-student at a small liberal arts  urlLink university &nbsp;in the northeast.&nbsp;I came here one year ago after a failed&nbsp;attempt to integrate into society after college. Now I'm living with a mathematician and a chemist and  trying  (see: failing) to write a thesis.   During one of my first few months at my new university I stepped into the student grocery store to buy some microwaveable food (since I can't cook anything besides&nbsp;the&nbsp;piece of cardboard I pop and lock on...oh shit, oh shit!!!) and while browsing, I overheard the f
