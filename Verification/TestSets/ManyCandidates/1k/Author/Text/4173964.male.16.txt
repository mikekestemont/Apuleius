Fuck me am I beat to shit. Today was suppose to be my day off but 9 am rolls around and guess who calls? No not my dream girl...goddamn supervisor calling me in for a 8.5 hours shift. So i stumble up there and get to work. A few hours later I find out this little doofus Tristan isn't showing up. So me being infinitely wise I volunteer to work overtime. I figure it's good money so why not? By 8:30 I'm beat to shit and decide to peace. But alas my parents aren't home so I have to drag my ass down home. Good god I can barely see I'm so tired.  What else has happened?....Yeah not a thing. Just wanted to bitch. Gonna fall asleep to the sweet melodies that are Deathcab for Cutie.  Adios
Dunno why I'm here. I really have nothing much to say I'm just uber bored due to the 3 day hiatus on gas pumping due to lack of scheduling. I think I'm gonna trim my nose hairs then go for a jog. I must see Napoleon Dynamite. A friend sent me the dance scene and I cried I laughed so hard. I'm doing it for the next dance show hands down.  I'm in  a better mood today. Dunno what was wrong with me last night. Maybe it'll kick back in tonight and I'll figure it out.  I'm watching Newlyweds season 2 right now. Jessica my oh my. How can something so hot be so stupid? Ok yeah easily I know I know.  I've decided I don't need a girlfriend I just need to get laid. I've got alot of pent uo sexual frustration. Need to let off some steam. Not saying I you know...would be rough or something like that...wow am I sounding like a creep here. CHANGE OF SUBJECT!!  I started listening to some of Johnny Cash's old stuff. Quality shit. Anyone who thinks they know everything about him because they've heard "hurt", you don't know shit. I'm getting tired of all these little 15 and 16 year old girls saying they love him and bands like  Zepplin and shit like that cause they're trying to be trendy. I went to Market Mall yesterday. UGH. So many wannabe trendy crap ass stores. All you see is what Cosmo says is cool these days. Even that "Play" is shit. trying to pretend they're indy but the second you step in the first album I saw was Jojo. I'm not saying I'm some indy freak. Just saying mainstream and indy are two completely different worlds and it's lame that they're trying to mesh them. Why can't people just be themselfs and stop having to be told what's cool or not. Gah lame.  Hey I bought Godsend yesterday. About to watch it. Looks scary as shit. Send in the clones oui?
I'm in a very strange mood tonight. I worked til 11 and had to walk home. All the way I listened to Dashboard Confessionals and it's made me very depressed. I just don't want things to change. I like how everything was during the school year. Even the bad stuff. At least I knew I had time to fix things. Now it feels like there's this huge weight pressing down and no way or time to change it. I just feel like I should have done more or resolved things more...resolutely. This summer has been an overall let down and for things to come to a close so abruptly and depressingly sucks. I just want to scream and let it all out but I'm scared I'll never be able to stop. I know that sounds lame but it's the only way I can say it. Fuck it's too late for this. I need some time to think things through. Tomorrow is another day after all.
Wow and now for something completely different. so I was originally suppose to head down to Kensington with my dearest friend Kirsten for a day of jugo juice and boy watching (for her not me I swear). She has to cancel but I end up heading down anyhoo. So I'm wandering around looking for something productive to do and out of no where my friend Julia appears. We get to talking and she introduces me to her friend Sara I think her name was. We end up spending the better part of the afternoon together which was a blast. I head home and am not in the door more than 10 minutes when I get an invite from the one and only Vanya to come hang out with her and Christine. So I head 'er over. The night started off normally. The usual snide remarks from the duo about me being a closet gay and then them grabbing each others ass and randomly spooning each other. We head to Vanya's and hang out there. On the way I saw my dear friend Janine (I have way to many friends who are girls. Time for an infusion of testosterone and sex...With women) Anyhoo it was the stereotypical night of a regular group of kids. Which is the exact opposite of my usual night (ie sit at home and say hello to miss Palmela Handerson). On the way home we listened to Deathcab which is one of my all time favorite albums. There is something extremely surreal when you sing the lyrics "She is beautiful but she doesn't mean a thing to me" right next to the girl whom until the very recent past I was coocoo over. Whatever. Probably never gonna see either of them ever again. Which is quite depressing actually to think that that might be my last memory of either of them. I've said it before but I'll say it again if you're reading this either of you. Have a goddam good life. You deserve nothing short of that.  *Heavy sigh* Goddam tired.  Found out my uncle whom I haven't seen in over 3 years (Dad's brother see Superfreak for an extremely abbreviated version of that story) is dying which i
