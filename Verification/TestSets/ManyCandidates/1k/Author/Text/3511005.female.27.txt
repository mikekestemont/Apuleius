Today is my appointment with the orthopedic surgeon. I am nervous. And it is not because of what you think. I am nervous that he will say that there is nothing he can do - or if there is something - that the process will take so long.   I am the kind of person who likes to see results now. I am that way with everything, even buying cars and houses.   I have not been good food or exercise wise. I know it is because of the appointment. I simply want to know. It is also partially due to my group. A couple of the people in my group of friends are having trouble right now.   I have to say that it is very interesting and rewarding being in a group of friends that care about one another. Last night I met with two. While we discussed the two members that were not present, it was not gossip or insults. We discussed how we can help. We got a plan and spoke from our hearts with the need to help.   I have had some pretty crappy friendships. I have enough horror stories to fill a blog. However, I am like the phoenix. From the absolute lowest with a friend I recreated myself with the help of a new friend. One that watched from the sidelines as I went down in flames. Together she helped me to become reborn - no that is not the right word, more like reestablished. The results - outstanding. I am more confident and feel that I deserve to have friends that like and respect me.  Another amazing thing is that our husbands get along as well. My sweetie has benefited greatly from this friendship. It is so nice to see him hang out with someone who respects him and knows how to tell a good joke.  She got me involved with a group of friends that she brought together. She is much stronger than she believes. Together we are a very unique group. We support each other in being the best that we can while trying to have fun.   Last night reminded me of this bond. How proud I am to know these beautiful and strong women. I am even prouder to be accepted by these women.
One of my favorite things in the world is going to dinner with my best friend. We went last night. However, I did not do well food wise. Cannot blame her at all. She is very supportive as well as both of our husbands. No, it was all me. I went in planning to get a great salad and ended up with a fried mess - but it was good. I have to understand what went wrong with my plan.   Doctor's appointment tomorrow. Knee ached all the way to work this morning - that is good. I am less likely to back out of the appointment.   I did it - perhaps it was posting it here that helped - I got my envelope ready for TSBPA. Now I wait for the letter that states if I am worthy of taking the exam.  To sum today - blah.
Ok so I admit it, I am anal. While my desk or house do not reflect this - it is true. I like things to be even, planning with an even number of weeks, and I want to know what is going to happen beforehand so that I can plan accordingly. While I am an anal person I am also such a procrastinator. I truly believe in playing today and working tomorrow to make up for it. This is not good, I know. However, this is my biggest fault. I received my transcripts from ACC. This is the last thing I need to complete my application of intent - actually intent is already filed only need to send transcripts. Hopefully I will gather the two transcripts and put together an envelope tonight. I know I did not get it in the mail the day after receiving it because I am afraid. This is a huge test and I get testing anxiety. I know that there is a thought in my mind that says "well if you don't send this in, you won't be able to test, or be able to fail". I never said it made sense. The people at Bisk CPA review told me to plan on studying 100 hours for every section. This is a lot of studying. So I have to plan, I cannot procrastinate with this. And I know with my anxiety that I may need 200 hours per section.   Here comes my anal portion. I have been trying to figure the best way to test. I graduate on May 14, 2004. There is a very big part of me that would like to have all testing and school done when I walk the stage. I even know that with taking only one class in the spring that I can possibly handle two sections while completing one in Oct and one in January. Then I got the crazy idea that I will prepare for all four sections and then over spring break take time from work and take all four sections. This sounded great. Time to complete the reviews and time to get it out of the way.   Then I hit a wall. After figuring up the study time needed for every day I realized, you cannot take any portion of the CPA in March.   AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Back to square one.
This past weekend I bought the South Beach Diet book. Don't get me wrong - I am still against low carb. However, South beach uses good carbs and good fats. I plan to incorporate Weight Watchers and South beach. Wish me luck. I have 46 weeks until graduation and plan to look wonderful. Not that I want to be a stick at graduation. I want to have the confidence that makes everyone think "WOW she is amazing".  Today I bought the South Beach cookbook. I am aiming for a healthy 4
