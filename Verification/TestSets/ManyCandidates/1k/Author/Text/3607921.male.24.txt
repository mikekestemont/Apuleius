Look I know I say this everyday but its so true.  Whoever truly enjoys their work... (I mean really enjoys it), I am envious of you.  I unfortunately find work arduous, long and tiring.  Do you think porn stars really love their jobs?  Do you think they come to work each day and are like woohoo... I get to have SEX today!  I'm sure they do.  Don't go see "saved!"  That movie made me want to punch someone out.  Its not like its entirely lame, but the people in the movie you hate, you end up hating so much the only thing you can concentrate on is their destruction.  The bad people are hardcore brainwashed Christians.   They should of been vampires.  My bosses are all South African, and they are nuts.  All they talk about are tits and golf.  They say cheers more often than I say "and."  I wonder how much longer I can take this job, its beginning to drive me crazy.  I mean I wake up I work.... maybe I sleep and then I work again.  OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.  My parents think I'm just being a pussy.  Whats up with that?
So many guys just save their money the moment they win the lottery.  Or they get depressed because they are richer than god, or they give to charity or something.  You wanna know what I would do if I won the lottery??  Thats right, somewhere in central houston..... maybe even in my apartment, I'd build my own full sized Isengard.  I mean how much does a tower of black rock cost these days anyway?  It can't be more than a few million smackers.  Is it illegal?  Do I need some kind of permit?  I NEED TO KNOW THESE THINGS.    I'm sure after the tower I'd have a few mill left to blow on hats. But man, if I had my own Isengard, Id stand on the top and drop waterbaloons on losers that don't have a tower ALL DAY.  Better yet I'd put like 30 of those batman search lights on the top and maybe some strobe action and some loud bass and turn it into the hippest club in fucking Texas.  Who wouldn't want to go rock out on Isengard! DOOT DOOT DOOT DOOT (just imagine that). Holy shit this is giving me a headache.  Seriously.... there are not enough cool tower clubs in Houston.
I'm gonna go ahead and write a bit more since its almost lunch time.  I had the coolest dream AGAIN last night.  This time it was more cooler (haha).  Probably about a year or two ago I had this dream about Ninjas fighting on the Eifle Tower.  Now I don't like Paris, but I'll be damned if Ninjas in Paris isn't cool (Sounds like a great movie!).  Anyways, these Ninjas are totally kicking the shit out of each other and they are fighting all over the place.  I mean in the elevator, on the stairs, fucking on top of the shit with the stars and the weapons.  They were all dressed in black (of course... no wussy WHITE ninjas) and they were all loud with the hiyahs and the WHOOOYAH!!!!  Anyway the first time I had the dream they were doing the ninja shit on tourists, this time its like they were playing king of the hill.  I guess their was no climax to the dream, which sucks because I wanted to dream more.  I mean I never really knew if they were just fighting for the honor of their master or just a free for all deathmatch on the ole tower.  Man I hate Paris.  I wish I were a Ninja.
I don't know whats possessing me to do it.  I'm thinking its somewhere between peer pressure from the 'dish, my own wild curiousity and a new source for boredom relief!  So what happens now?  I write my thoughts in this everyday?  Hmmm..... so what should I talk about.   Does anyone remember College Station on Wednesday?  All I know is the JetUH is covered in mud, I'm missing a sock and my jaw makes this weird clicking sound anytime I bite into something.  I know my camera has got evidence of retarded drunkeness and I'm sure the motherfucking (and by that I mean swell) carbomb is to blame.  Thank you to all who kept me alive!  Skipping work and faking sick claiming a bad hot dog from James Coney Island was so goddamn awesome.
O.k. so yeah.... I took the hot ass 28 year old out again last night, and she totally freaked on me!!! &nbsp; We went to BW3's and had us some wings and shit and tossed back a few beers!&nbsp; This girl can hold her alcohol!&nbsp; Then after that we went to this strip club (cus she said she'd never been before) and we had some more drinks.... yadda yadda.&nbsp; THE NIGHT WAS TOTALLY ROCKIN..... we even made out and stuff and that was nice!&nbsp;  &nbsp; Anyway long story short... she kind of distracts me when I'm driving away and I hit a curb and one of my hubcaps goes flying off.&nbsp; She is laughing&nbsp;her ass off.... and ummm yeah I'm slightly annoyed (come on people its my new fucking car!).&nbsp;&nbsp; As I'm&nbsp;attempting to put&nbsp;the hubcap back on (albeit unsuccesfully) she tells me to "forget it stupid, do it&nbsp;when you're sober."&nbsp; BLAMMO&nbsp;  What the fuck does that mean!?&nbsp; I ripped off the hubcap... threw it in the backseat and said "fine, but you don't have to be a bitch about it."&nbsp; She&nbsp;told me to fuck off and walked away.&nbsp; WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE!!!!&nbsp;

Jeez I'm miserable right now.&nbsp; Last night I fell asleep at about 8:30 again..... which seems to be the sunday trend.&nbsp; Anyways, along with sunday trend I wake up around midnight to watch Return of the King, but what I FORGOT to do was put my fucking work clothes in the damn dryer.&nbsp; Shit man....here I am at work now.... and my compucycle shirt, slightly ripped jeans, unmatching socks and b
