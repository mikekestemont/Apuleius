So, George Bush is still an idiot I suppose..... I mean how f*cking clever can one man be. He fooled all the terrorists and Millitia men by having the transfer of power given to Iraq in the middle of the night last night...... So I give Mr. Bush the First Ever  ' Cap'N Conservative Smartest Man Alive Award '.... But you know what, Big Media doesn't care, NOOOOOOOOOO , they just want to suck Michael Moore's big Hog Ass some more..... I'm listening to Glenn Beck right now talking about somebody's experience who went to go see Fahrenheit 9/11 over the weekend and how there were blatant lies such as Moore saying at the beginning of the movie ' I nevery major recount Gore won the Presidential Election '.... That should make one wanna walk out of the film at the beginning for having a bold face lie perpetrated at the beginning of a 'Documentary '... But then again I'm asking Liberals to use there brain here. I remember when I was younger, I used to like Moore and his tv shows ' TV Nation ' and ' The Awful Truth ' but then I found out his ' documentaries ' were nothing more than acted out personal opinion and vision. And Michael Moore is not fat, He's like that Blob of ectoplasm in Ghostbusters 2, remember when you yelled at it and showed hatred toward it, it grew bigger??? Well that's what has happened to more, he's just like the pink blob and his girth keeps on getting bigger and bigger with all the hate he instills about America and for America. ( Comment : The Producers of this Website wish to tell the readers that the views of CapnConservatives are his views and his views alone, if any ectoplasmic blob of slime was offended by being compared to Michael Moore, we are sorry and we agree with your complaints ). It's a good thing Spiderman 2 comes out on Wednesday, that way this film will be forgotten very soon. I bet Michael Moore smells like a weird cheese of some sort. I mean with his girth and huski-ness it would be hard to get in between most of his fat rolls when he showers, if he showers??? And the dead fat skin cells would just fester in the sweltering heat generated by his fat rolls rubbing against each other when he barely breathes, all sorts of bacteria forming and coming to life. Maybe he takes a shower in Grease and someone needs to buy him one, JUST ONE, F*CKING HAT TO FIT HIS BULBOUS HEAD..... I seriously think Moore just needs to get laid, once...... I swear to God if he gets laid once, his next documentary will be about how Flowers broom in the springtime and love is eternal..... Of course finding a VICTIM like that is like trying to get Parents to send there kids to Neverland Ranch for a sleepover party.        I saw John Kerry on TV today and the guy just looks like he smells, like he's always got the 5 o'clock shadow and it's that weird smell of sweat and stetson that I sense everytime I see him. Everytime I see an ad with ' This ad approved by Me, John Kerry ' I sit back and laugh and think of him saying that like ' This ad approved by John Kerry........ I think...... Did I????? * Papers heard in the background ruffling *..... Ok I did, that's right.... Good.... I approved it...... wait! I mean I didn't..... GodD*mnit, which one is it! ' He's easily confused. At least when Kerry loses the election he can be the National Spokesman for ' This is a Medal, Not a Ribbon Charity ', where he can go around to different vets houses and determine if they actually have a medal or a ribbon. And then he can go work in a bank approving home loans ' Congratulations Mr. and Ms. Jenkins on your new home '.......... Two weeks later Mr. and Miss Jenkins are eating dinner watching American Idol, holding hands when the phone rings ' Mr. Jenkins, I'm sorry I approved your house loan before I rejected it, you'll have to give it back to us. thanks '....... And then Al Gore can come in and console the Jenkins by screaming like his toes are being gnawed on by a metal toothed gypsy gnome ' HE BETRAYED THIS HOME, HE PLAYED ON YOUR FEARS ' And then Teddy Kennedy can come by and crash into a power line pole to give everyone a great chuckle and lighten the mood. And that my friends is your Democratic Party in a nutshell. A bunch of Unqualified Riff Raff given a chance to control the government. I know personally I'll feel safer with them in control............................. FARRRTTTTTTTT!       I think John Kerry wears Sock Suspenders.... don't ask me why but whenever I see him, I see him in an old white v-neck with various weird stains spotted here and there and sitting around in some boxers with his shirt tucked tightly into them and wearing sock suspenders while drinking cheap brandy. But back to my point I made last post, isn't he scary looking, I mean there's just something wrong with him, that's why you never see him holding babies, the mothers are afraid he'd eat them or something. He just looks unnatural. At least at Halloween Time his masks will be a huge hit with the children who want to dress up as the Long Face Hobbit Presidential Candidate. They could also market it to the kids as a way of getting out of trouble to the kids too. *** ' Kids are you tired of getting caught lying???? Not anymore, with the John Kerry Presidential Candidate Long Face Hobbit Mask.... Watch as Little Jimmy demonstrates..... * Parents bust into Timmy's room * ' Timmy you didn't do the dishes, your grounded ' * Timmy looks at the Camera and a lightbulb goes off above his head..... T
