Week1-3  1.	What did you experience uploading your sites to unix?  2.	What are some of the global impacts of being able to create a homepage on the Internet?  3.	Where is the technological city state and why is it refereed to as the 21st century fortress city?  Singapore is the new technological city state. It is refered to this because it is considered an intelligent island. It is completely enclosed and very strict. Everybody watches everything they do, under one domain. 4.	What is right or wrong about machines influence on our lives? Machines have been influencing our lives since the first caveman took a stick and hit a stone with it. Our ability to build and use technology is part of our nature. However, what happens when this technology begins to influence us. We shuold not be influenced by these machines because who will be in power, us or the machines. We should use machines for influence, such as television ads, but should not let the machine itself inluence our life. 5.	E-mail your web address of the page you worked on today to three other people in the class (see group for e-mail addresses). When you have received three other student's websites write a few paragraphs on what the person is telling us with their website.  The first blogger I went to was Meghan Breedlove’s. It is apparent at the beginning that it is most likely a female’s site, due to the color, pink. She enjoys shopping running, and going out. It is also apparent that she likes most kinds of music, as well as watching movies. The next blogger I went to was Argenis Rodriguez. He enjoys many activities that are active and sporty. He seems to enjoy sci-fi movies as well as comedy movies, but he deffinetely didn’t like robocop 3. I liked the color he used on his blogger. I like the color scheme and the circles.  6.	In the View my complete profile area of your blogger fill in some of your interests. Refresh your page and link to someone with your similar interests, which are linked from your profile.  I clicked on my link for the book “The Dark Tower”. Another blogger that came was a girl named Elizabeth. She is feom an english speaking country not in  the U.S., but says she would be democratic if she was an american. She seems very liberal. If I had to guess I would say she is from canada or england, due to some of the literature she choose as her favorite books as well as her liberal stance. 7.	Read the article about the Baghdad blogger and write a couple of paragraphs on how Salam Pax saw his blog and how others, especially in the Western Media saw his blog. What would you see as the similairty or differences between a blog and an 'embedded reporter' with a United States organisation such as CNN news and which would you believe would be giving a true report of fact or which would be giving a reportage that was politcally or motivated by the writer's worldview? You may want to compare what Salam Pax says with what this reporter who was an "embedded reporter" with NBC has to say. Salam Pax saw his blog as a threat. He talks so much and so strongly about bieng fearful of  “Mr. Site killer”. But what this threat comes from is why it was so important. The fact that Pax was speaking his mind in a country where this is not a good thing. People saw this blog as a representation of how all people felt in Baghdad. This is misrepresenting because he is only one man and therfore one point of view.  	This is similar to an embeded reporter in that it is an account. It is a point of view, expressed through facts and forms one man holds true. A major difference is that an embeded reporter will give a point of view, but using the facts and forms consistant with the target audience, not neccesarily his own.
Week 1-1  Week 1-1: Name as many members of your class as you can remember.  	Meagan, Sammy, Justin, Katherine, Noel, Colin, Ann Marie,   Week 1-2: Write a paragraph on what you see as communicating on the Internet.  	Communicating on the internet can take many forms. The one people are most familiar with is E-mail. Most everybody has an e-mail addres nowadays and people use them often. Also, people use chat rooms or instant messangers to commuicate in real time over the internet. This has been beneficial not only to the public sector but the private as well. People also communicte over the interenet by message boards and weblogs. These can provide anything from feedback on a website to discussion and debate. I feel that these three or four instances cover the msjority of communication on the internet.
what is your 'blogger' address? 	http://com465milin.blogspot.com/   Write a couple of sentences on each of these new tensions that technology brings to society.  Centralization vs. Fragmentation= I feel that new technology causes centralization. People of different backgrounds are coming together to work and improve things. A holistic perspective vs. Specialized knowledge=  New technology  creates a holistic perspective by making new knowledge available to all. People then receive a more holistic perspective on things. Too much information vs. Too little information= Technology makes so much informtion available that there is too much information to sift through to try to find what you want. Leadership vs. Fellowship= technology causes fellowship among people because people feel a sense of community in new technologies with the others that use it Worker isoliation/alientation vs. Community connections= Technology is isolating the worker of today. With all the new mobile technology, people don’t have a sense of an office community as in the past. Sharing vs. Withholding access to information= Information "filters" vs. Disintermediation (Removing the middleman. The term is a popular buzzword used to describe many Internet -based businesses that use the World Wide Web to sell products directly to customers rather than going through traditional retail c
