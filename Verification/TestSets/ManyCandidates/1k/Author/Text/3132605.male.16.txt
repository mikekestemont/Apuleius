I'm not a perfect person There's many things I wish I didn't do But I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I'm sorry that I hurt you It's something I must live with everyday And all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away And be the one who catches all your tears Thats why i need you to hear  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is You [x4]  I'm not a perfect person I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I've found a reason to show A side of me you didn't know A reason for all that I do And the reason is you   THE REASON by:hoobastank  urlLink

Man, i hate this, i need a girl back in my life. they just seem to fill an empty void that nothing else can fill. I just miss having it in my life. Its just for some reason my whole being happy depends on it and i dont know y. mabey its because girls always were a big deal in my life and they were the only thing that made me happy. I dont know. but hopefully that one will find me and make me the real me again. some thing that doesn't happen very often

Well, i have to say rain changes my mood... its weird, i seem to think more clearly when it rains. I feel like i can just sit and stare at the rain with out feeling i have anything else to worry about. I just imagine that i sitting there with my girl alone together just watching the rain. it sooths me to know that there is one girl out there that can fulfil this stupid day dream. Hopefully i may have just met her, butt ne way.... rain can be amazingly beautiful and incredibly depressing at the same time. i feel as though i slowly slipping back to thoes places i dont want to return to. and now with this new person i dont know how my life is goin to change.    hopefullly it will be a good change but i desperatly need something to cheer me up during this rain......   Also i have found my love for barbershop music grows. i know weird, bu i dont know i just cant get the amazing harmonies out of my head and its driving me nuts my group doesnt want to work to be good. If you could get past the cheezey old songs you would find some of the most amazing four part harmony songs ever created recently. I just cant get them out of my head. and their harmonies are sooo sooothing..... but w/e  MEH, Joe
