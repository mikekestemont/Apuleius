Ughh...  Just got done recovering from 2 exams for the same class back to back.  This summer I decided to go ahead and take a 5 week Anatomy & Physiology course as it was one of the few remaining classes I have left before I have to apply to get accepted into the nursing school.    In hindsight, I would recommend this only for extremely brave souls.  The class requires HUGE amounts of memorization, and the lecture and labs got all out of order, so I ended up having to study twice as much, with no overlapping material.  Oh well, live and learn.   At least I know for sure now that the ankle bone connects to the foot bone.  :)  Or, to be more precise, the distal end of the tibia articulates with the talus to form the ankle joint.  But anyways, I'll probably be studying every conceivable chance I get, as I believe the final is comprehensive and we've covered 15 chapters of every bump, knob, and concavity on the human body.  So updates will be pretty scanty.  Only 4 more days til I can leave the hobbit study cave and wander around in the big blue room outside!
Blogging has turned out to be a bit more fun than I expected.  After looking around, I found a lot of neat sites that let you provide Letterman-style custom lists.  There is a link under my Lists category to my Netflix queue so the curious can see what my significant other and I are watching.  I've already sent back Casablanca (excellent, excellent movie!!!) and the SNL movie, so the Netflix fairies should be sending Lain shortly.  Lain is a Japanese anime movie that is fairly well acclaimed with tons of Apple and BeOS references tucked in amongst the plot.  I'm considering finding a host that lets me post ASP pages so I can do more fun stuff with this little site.  Any recommendations on a cheap, but reliable host?  -- Aeryth
For all the Mac-o-philes out there, yesterday was a big day.  Yesterday, previews of the new "Tiger" OS were shown to developers at Apple's developer conference (WWDC).  Overall, I have to say I was pretty impressed.  The new Spotlight technology promises to make finding and correlating data on the old hard drive a lot easier.  The day before WWDC, users on MacRumors.com had the guilty pleasure of viewing some unauthorized "preview" screenshots of the Tiger OS.  One of the features whose authenticity was doubted most was the new Dashboard feature.  I know there are lots of Konfabulator fans, but anyone who knows me knows I have an extreme distaste for desktop widgets.  In fact, I believe desktop widgets are a littermate of the annoying yellow Office agent dog in Windows XP.  So it's pretty safe to say that I was praying that the new shots were faked.  Turns, out the screenshots were true.  The Dashboard works on the metaphor that we keep objects that we use often but not all the time within reach (or buried within reach in my case) in a top desk drawer.  Well, the Dashboard is a special "drawer" screen mode of Expose that is reached by a special keyboard stroke (or probably a mouse gesture as well).  Little Javascript driven widgets lay in the drawer and you can manipulate them and close the drawer once you are finished with a keystroke or mouse move.  Personally, I don't like the new feature.  IMHO, desktop widgets constitute a violation of many rules of good UI, which is especially tragic considering all the time and energy Apple has put into place into making sure their user experience guidelines are documented and adopted.  Widgets have 4 major problems:  1.  UI guidelines protect the user.    Developers should not have access to colors.  Anyone who looks at the Windows XP interface can tell you that.  XP, the first truly multicolored MS OS has red, blue, orange, green, and other colors thrown around in borderline random areas of the desktop.  It has the style sensibility of the late 80s when blinding your fellow man with swirls of neon color was the desired look.  The stereotypical computer geek is not an artist, and tends to have poor fashion sense bordering on the color blind.  I have seen hideous UIs that were borderline unusable using the common controls in both the Mac OS and in Windows.  We have problems as it is making user friendly UIs within the existing parameters.  Do you really want to give these people a blank palette?  2.  Widgets make the user experience inconsistent.    One of the beautiful things about Mac OS is that you can sit down at any Mac or Windows box and know how to interact with almost any element you see onscreen.  Buttons are clicked.  Mac programs almost always have a Preferences menu item.  There are visual cues in Windows that let you figure out what the keyboard shortcut is to particular functionality.  Forms are square, easily tile, and conserve screen space.    Widgets sacrifice all this consistency in favor of flashy looks.  I remember looking at QuickTime 4 and trying to figure out how to interact with it (especially the volume control).  Windows Media Player with its strange new skin is another example.  When the program is onscreen, it takes up way more screenspace than is necessary.  You can see spans of empty space used for nothing but just being there.  Even with visualizations turned off, the thing is monstrously huge in comparison with what could be done with a simple form.  I can see why Apple released the 30" display.  If you make extensive use of widgets, you'll need the extra space!  3.  Real life metaphors don't always translate very well to the computer screen.  Ok, once again, the Windows release of QuickTime 4.  This application was very memorable, mostly for the awful interface.  Apple attempted to make the player a true to life representation of a real player, down to a thumb wheel for the volume.  However, they did not take into account that humans interact w
