hey all why am i so bored all the time?... well, today i wanted to stress how much fashion punks piss me off... well its a whole lot. cause i see these kids decked out in punk gear with their mohawks up and bondage belts and all that stuff... yet i go to denver local punk shows and they are nowhere to be seen. they dont even go to shows when major touring bands play... but if they were to go to a show and support their scene it would only be a major touring band... its like they think they are too good for the local scene or they just arent dedicated to the lifestyle they pretend to be living and show people how "punk rock" they are when they do nothing for the scene but make it worse. i saw a girl at my school with a purple mohawk and a misfits shirt and all that crap, with some new oxblood color boots... and she looked all decked out yet she was rockin white laces clearly not knowing that having white laces and goin to a punk show would get your head kicked in because its an obvious symbol of being white pride. why dont these kids take the initiative to go to shows? is it they are lazy to look into them? or is it because of the same 4 lame ass excuses i alllways hear? "my parents wont let me", "i cant get any money", "i cant get a ride", "the weather is bad" hrmmm... YOUD PROBABLY HAVE MONEY IF YOU DIDNT SPEND ALL OF IT ON WHAT YOU WEAR. all of you kids piss me off, stay the fuck out of our scene. recently the local street punk scene in denver has been mad at even ME because i have been fucking busy and going to crust shows. but at least i make an effort, rather than spending hours on my mohawk then going out and eating at some yuppie resturant, and all the while not knowing a DAMN thing about native american opression or even sticking by other punks and going against all the beliefs you pretend to have. either stop posing and pretending to be a part of a subculture that hates you, or fuck off and die.   its a lifestyle, not a fucking trend.  up the real punx and crusties   music:Hellkrusher-wasteland
