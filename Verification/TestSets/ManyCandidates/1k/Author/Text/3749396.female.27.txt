Why is it that girls feel they have to endure hours of torture for the sake of beauty? For instance, I recently spent 4 hours in a salon getting every bit of nutrience sucked from my hair just to look "pretty". Color, highlights, cut, style...the list goes on and on. As if that wasn't enough I decided to get my eyebrows plucked too. Talk about torture. I felt like I should have been giving up top secret military information after a session of that. Forget making the hostages stand on buckets or fondle each others privates, just schedule them for a "relaxing day of beauty" at their local salon. They'll be giving up Osama in no time flat.

Here's a funny story to tell the kiddies. I went out with my brother and a few friends last weekend to get my drink on. While we were out, my brother went from a very smart, funny guy to this slobbery, puky monster named Otis. Anyway, one of my friends drove us there, so when we got bounced out of the bar(my brother was curled up in the bathroom floor with his head resting peacefully on the urinal)this guy had to take us home. He had apparently been making out with some girl when we pulled him away. He drove like a madman to get us home and back before this girl leaves. He had decided in a matter of an hour that he was in love and couldn't live without this person. Obviously, the Jack and Coke was doing it's job. So, she goes home with him and being the nice guy he is, he holds her hair back while she puked. Hold on, here comes the funny. Apparently, while she was puking, she shit herself! OH GOD! Hold on while I wipe away the tears. Not only did she shit herself, but she was wearing my friends shorts at the time. But, being the trooper he is, he just told her to shower and they got it on anyway. Now, he is kind of bummed because she hasn't called him back since this whole "shitting" incident happened. He thinks it's because she doesn't like him. I think it could possibly be because...well...SHE SHIT HERSELF!! I'm sorry, if I got so drunk that I crapped my drawers, I would never again talk to anyone that had witnessed this experience. As a matter of fact, I'm afraid I would have to relocate to some small out of the way place...like Yemen.
So, I went to some punk show last night with my boyfriend. All I can really say about the guys I saw play was they really liked their treble. Maybe I'm just getting old, but heavens to betsy that music was just too darn loud. I have thought long and hard about how I could describe this music. The only thing I came up with was throwing a hundred angry cats at a blackboard with their claws out. Now I know that sounds a bit harsh, but I'm the one that has 4 to 6 weeks to wait for my ear drum to grow back. I actually saw one guy, who was smoking a cigarette, tear the filter off and shove it into his ear. How punk rock is that? I guess desperate times call for desperate measures.
I have always heard that the older you get the worse birthdays are. Until this year I had never experienced that. My birthday is only 2 weeks away, and usually one of my friends asks me what I want to do or what I want. This year I had already decided that I didn't want anything materialistic. I just wanted all my friends to go out somewhere with me for one night. Whenever one of my friends birthdays came up this year I planned or helped plan the party. Even if I wasn't asked to help I at least showed up. Well, I finally got tired of waiting for someone to ask me what I wanted to do, so I called one of my friends. I simply asked her if she would want to go out the weekend before my birthday. After 12 years of being friends and having her plan my birthday every year, she apparently forgot. She made plans for that whole weekend. "No problem" I said. Then today I called another one of my friends to see if she wanted to do something. She too forgot and made plans for that same weekend. So far out of all my "friends" I have 2 that said they would like to do something. I guess times like these let you know who your real friends are. Happy birthday to me.
I have always been fascinated with children. Not in that Michael Jackson sort of way.(Man he's never gonna live that down) More in a respectful way. I've always loved their honesty and their imagination. I have a little boy that is about to turn three, and everyday is an adventure. He keeps me laughing all the time. The mind on this child is always working. Example: This morning we were getting ready for work/school. He was watching a cute little cartoon named "Franklin". For those of you without children, Franklin is a little turtle that has a baby bear for a best friend. Every show they have some adventure and learn some lesson. You know, typical kids show. Anyway, this morning they were sad because they let their pumpkin roll down the hill and it busted. So along comes Grandma opossum to make everything alright. We had been naming the animal as they came on the screen. My son knew all the animals except the opossum. He asked me what&nbsp;kind of animal it was and I told him. He looked at me with this innocent little expression and said ,"Daddy has that in his truck." Now, my ex-husband is weird, but I just couldn't imagine a opossum in his t
