I've never really thought about keeping a journal...Okay that is not true-I've made many aborted attempts at journal writing. My last one turned out to be a total disaster. However, they say that if you fail you should try again. I thought it was just "try again" but yesterday, my friend said it was "try try again" I don't know if it takes a different meaning, but the point is I should just keep trying damn it! My first attempt at journal writing went down the drain with that bitch and that asshole invading my privacy. Some people might think that this is completely stupid since I know that someone was able to get into my computer and read stuff that was none of their business...why would I do it again? Well....I'm still not sure, but I guess I need to feel safe and I need to know that I'm safe now and nothing like that will happen again. Beside, even though my life is pretty damn interesting...no one will really take the time to read about it. If they do it again, then I feel very sorry for them because instead of LIVING life, they're wasting time reading about someone else's life. Frankly I don't really care if they are reading. What's the point of me writing all this if no one will read it? In fact this could be my 10 minutes of fame. :) If they were to use this information against me then it would be a problem, but I have nothing to regret or to hide. What's the point of having a book if you're not going to open it and read it? I'm not sure why I'm even writing as if there was an audience...I don't know maybe it'll give some random person something to read and kill time.  Anyway, today I felt very bad when I found out that my sister thinks that it's her fault that I almost died. Just when I thought that I was putting all that behind me..It shows up again. I'm way pass the whole "maybe I'm crazy, because only crazy people would try suicide"-stage. You would be amazed at all the things you learn when you read. (Something that I love doing, but for some reason had forgotten about) Now I know that there are cases when your life is going perfectly fine and you're as healthy as can be, but some tragic or highly emotional event happens which triggers this suicide reaction. Exactly what happened to me thanks to that bitch sending me that poem that Robert wrote for her and my "compassionate" doctor saying very matter-of-factly "oh you probably have a brain tumor". A couple of weeks ago I started thinking that Robert had some blame for this as well, and had a few "not very nice"-words for him, I even thought that the reality of it all was that he's an asshole who just used me and got what he wanted until he got scared of responsibility. After all, that's what Kristi keeps telling me.....and then it hit me. Why the hell do I keep listening to everything people say? It's not their life...it's  my  life. It's funny how things have a way of happening...and every day I confirm that your destiny is pretty much all set, you just have to read the signs. I got an e-mail from my sister about some survey that you have to answer with lyrics from one band or one singer...the first band that came to mind was "The Beatles" but then I remembered how this morning when I woke up, my mom was playing "Thanks for the memories".....when I woke up and heard that...the first person that came to mind was Robert and then I thought maybe that's a sign that all I have left about him are memories and I should be thankful for that. This made me want to find the lyrics and while was looking for them I found other songs...among them "My way" by Frank Sinatra and that's when I thought...here's a man who more than likely didn't have a perfect life, and made mistakes, yet he didn't regret anything and more importantly, he was happy. So I kept thinking and thinking and then I realized that when I was with Robert I always tried to live by that motto "Don't regret anything" so why is it that after a few months, I start to second-guess myself? Because I'm stupid enough to listen to what people have to say. I need to stop doing that, so that's what I've decided to do from now on and this time I will be VERY firm about it. I sort of have been doing it ever since I had that little conversation with Olivia about abortion and how she would never do it because she had already lost a baby once....yet when I was in that position she thought that it would be totally stupid of me to have a baby and so the best thing was for me to abort. At first I thought it was very hypocritical of her to say that, then I realized that it's just human nature. We think we can give advice and be all wise, yet you can never really do that because you will never be in the exact same situation that the person who's seeking advice is. In this case nobody knows what I know and what my mom went through after having an abortion. The anger I felt when she finally told me (I knew, but for some reason it always felt like it had been a dream and I was just making it up), and the disappointment of loosing the chance of having a brother closer to my age. Therefore, it's completely stupid of us to ask for advice in the first place,.....especially of me considering how stubborn I am and knowing that in the end I'm going to do what I want to do. Asking for advice only makes me mad, pissed off and d
