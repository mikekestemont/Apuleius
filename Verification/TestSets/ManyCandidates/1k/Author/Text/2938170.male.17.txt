3. rugbyness starts up to a point, hockey? 4. halloween brutalness is wicked  rugby started in september, and weird as it was CLARKE started rugby! course they didnt do half as good as ssss tourney wise, pics, but sites down so i aint botherin to put em up. that was it for our season, cause usually rugby's a 2parter, 7s in the fall and 15s in the spring but for the spring we got rugby. hockey started, there was 2 orono teams, and i was the ONLY grade 12 on one team while the other team had 7 grade 12s, IT SUCKED! the konopka bros were suppose to be on my team but shit happened, (it woulda been 4-3 ratio but oh well, I'm captain of my team and fast forward orono rep team, former all ontario champs 3 years running got knocked outta the playoffs by newcastle who in turn lost in the next round (durham region loses? its seriously not possible)  halloween started yes it did, me and Geoff did the regular stupid shit. twas a fun night, and to finish it off i stopped by kimmy #5's halloween  party but didnt get drunk.
meh, I got 3 hours till hockey. ill try to sum this stuff up: 1. first week, orono fair 2. new classes new peeps, university fair  1. well in the summer hmmm i gotta job at IGA, in the deli. went to Summer Sanitarium, SarsStock and hit justin timberlake with a water bottle! soon after on somethin unrelated my site was shutdown...as well as my blog. First week of schools means hitting on the new girls, initating 9ers (shampooed a few with soap from the washroom) but most of all the orono fair. this year me and jewlz (julie) went 2gether and met up with groups from both schools there. eventually i won her a stuffed somethin and we were accordin to me, her and a few carnies boyfriend and girlfriend for the night, and we chilled without getting drunk unlike a few of our friends  2. started the year off with spare, calculus, biology, lunch and gym but i added a geometry class for spare and eventually got the highest mark on that exam ever (93%). new VP replaced Joly, and is actually worse then Joly. his name is Majidell and I don't even think the teacher's like him. so im in gr12 now, guess that means next year is university, so i was convinced by my rents to go the university fair in the t.dot. definitely worth it, me and bobby went, got sooo much free shit, and decided since we were asian and they were racist certain stands did give us free shit by leaving it there cough *backpacks* cough *binders* s'alll good. we walked around the t.dot for awhile and then twas over. oh yah, new neighbour named Ryan in grade 10 at ma school, and its like since my rents are loaded i will occasionally come home from school and find a note saying, "Went to  blank , be back  blank ." This was the case near the end of september, after school I go home and find a note sayin "Went to  Cancun , be back  in 3 weeks ." You gotta understand this is normal, and who am I to argue? I got a car for 3 weeks, so I drove to school everyday and on the last day even gased her up! note: my rents did phone home occasionally so it wasnt like they just left me on my own, they let a few hundred for food
so its like my old site has been down since the summer, my old blog was shutdown since september, and for awhile the closest i been to the net is msn. but im back now, grounded forawhile so after work ill talk about the past few months until im back in party-ability-to-go-to-ness. prolly wont go in chronological order, but, i dunno. so hmmmm...my old site...all those pics...gone, it sucks, but oh well. stuff that just happened is the freshest in my mind so itll be that then everything leadin up to it.   last night, after work I found myself at 1 in the morning on the patio of a house in the shwa, with a hugeass headache and loudmusic still blarin. there was people gettin drunk and high everywheres and I stumble down the steps to the backyard area when I hear this constant ringing. still goin, tryin to walk around to stop everything from spinning I see my friend Carolyn, the one who brought me to the party and im like take me to hommeee so she does, and halfway there I realize the ringing was my cellphone and not my ears. it was my rents. nuff said.   since september its been a story, so it has a bunch of chapters, check it out yo: 1. first week, orono fair 2. new classes new peeps, university fair 3. rugbyness starts up to a point, hockey? 4. halloween brutalness is wicked 5. an american thanksgivings in america 6. xmas in tha everywhere, NYC, LV and t.dot 7. new years in barrie, sorta 8. exams and all semester 2 beginnings 9. devon's party, lindsey's party 10. an invitation from an o'neill girl in detail
