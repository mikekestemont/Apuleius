Probably one of my weirdest combinations: I just finished reading chapter 1 for my CPCU 510 class  and  started working with my birthday present from my son and wife - a Scholastic electronics kit.  Risks of insurance and electronics - go figure!  Fortunately for me, the CPCU book was interesting.  The electronics isn't... although I'm a bit beyond the "age 7" it's rated at.  :)
Not a clue what I'm doing here - just following a link from Google.  I guess a few links are in order... my  urlLink home page ,  urlLink AppleCommander , and my  urlLink electronics projects .
We spent somewhere around eight hours yesterday at the  urlLink Lodge @ Cedar Creek .  Wow, what a day!  I didn't expect to be so wiped out afterwards... I didn't even make it through Brother Bear.  We all had a great time.  I didn't even need to worry about getting sunburned!  (c:
Wow, talk about good timing.  I was debating on what to install on the laptop - Eclipse 2.1.3 or the latest 3.0 release candidate.  Lo-and-behold, 3.0 was released last night.  Makes for an easy decision.  Looks good as always!  As usual, I'm in awe of these guys.  They have done a wonderful job making a useful tool.  Now I just need to get all of my development environments onto the Eclipse platform and I'd be all set!  If you do any development - especially Java development - check out  urlLink Eclipse .
I've got my new laptop, and I've been spending a little bit of time moving in, so-to-speak.  In fact, I've barely begun.  However, when I've finished, this will be my "desktop" as well as my laptop.  Life should be quite a bit easier as I won't need to move data between two machines.  The docking station is pretty nice.  My only disapppointment is that the networking doesn't work with my business laptop.  I've got a Compaq N610C for work and I picked up a HP zt3000 (custom) laptop for personal use.  The port replicator is compatible for these machines - which is great.  Except that the networking doesn't work with the N610C.  The monitor, keyboard, and mouse work - as well as the power, of course.    I initially reported this as a bad port replicator, and I was hoping/assuming that I was right.  In fact, the tech support guys that I talked to thought so.  However, no such luck!  I still haven't called back HP on this - I probably should.  OTOH, the new laptop is really cool.  Widescreen and phenominal picture quality.  My son and I just watched Sinbad on it at the kitchen table.  Pretty cool - and I still had an hour of battery life left.  Maybe I'll actually be able to eke out more than four hours on the battery.  That'd be really cool!!
I released  urlLink AppleCommander  1.3.3 tonight.  I was going to do some additional stuff, but figured that since I was doing a lot of reorganizing (and the next step could be huge), I should get my updates out and available ... Plus it was something on my "todo" list.  (c:
Just in case you actually haven't heard about  urlLink Wikipedia , you really should check it out.  Once a day, at a minimum so you can scan the featured article.  It seems to be growing by leaps and bounds and is currently heading towards the 287000 article mark.  So what?  I think that most (if not all) of Wikipedia is created and maintained by fellow enthusiasts.  Very cool stuff written by someone who is probably passionate about the subject.  The sheer number of people reading eachothers work keeps errant persons in check.  Seems to work pretty well!
More garden work.  Rather oddly, we also watched A Bridge Too Far about Operation Market Garden.  (So it's a stretch - who cares?)  The garden work went fast, but the movie was actually somewhat slow.  Go figure.   urlLink AppleCommander  1.3.2 was released this evening.  Most of the web page is updated... but I forgot to update the current version number.  Oops.  I haven't posted this to any of the news groups yet, so we'll see if anyone notices.  (c:
I spent some time working in  urlLink AppleCommander  today.  I had left off with the next release (1.3.2) nearly complete - and the last piece looked real simple.  Obviously, I was wrong.  (c:  Hopefully it'll be ready by the end of the week.  I've got two more changes - one that should be simple and another that will definately take time.  I wasn't even aware of it until I realized that it wasn't marked with an asterisk (my way of marking something complete is to change the 'o' to a '*').
Let's talk about flip-flops. I won't spell it out for you - think of the current stance of President Bush and read the following:         urlLink Prayer Focus - April, 2001       urlLink Why Christians Should Not Vote for George W. Bush - February 2004       urlLink George W. Bush on Civil Rights       urlLink Bush's Abortion Flip-Flop ?      urlLink La Cage au George W.       urlLink Bush Backs Gay-Marriage Ban     So, before being elected, our "compassionate" conservative President (which is possible, I just don't believe President Bush is compassionate) was planning on keeping President Clinton's "leave it alone" attitude as well as originally supporting Roe vs. Wade. Now he's flip-flopped.    So, let's quit the name-calling and get on to the issues!    [An aside, and somewhat a different topic is this: Why does Vice President Dick Cheney not beat up President Bush for his hatred of homosexuality? Dick Cheney's  daughter  is a lesbian! I'd be vociferously protesting such a move myself.]

This is sort of a book mark to me. One of the blogs I read pointed to  urlLink this blog  - the 3rd comment containes a link to the  urlLink NIH website on stem cells .
urlLink This is weird . I wonder what the real story is.
