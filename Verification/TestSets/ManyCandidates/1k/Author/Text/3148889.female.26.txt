My first post on my new weblog.  I started Fat Girl Films last month....well, I've had the production company for a number of months but I'm just starting to do something with it.  It has also undergone a few name changes as of late.  I finally decided on fat girl films because it's funny, cute and gets attention.....hmm, sounds just like me...exactly!    I'm working a couple of short film scripts which will go into production in the next few weeks.  I am very excited and extremely nervous about this.  I also purchased a new 12 in. PowerBook G4 with SuperDrive....You gotta mention the SuperDrive just to let folks know that you spent a little extra cash.  I would have loved to get the 15 in. but the pocketbook was already starting to feel the strain of the 12in but hell, you gotta have the SuperDrive.  I have great eye sight and I can easily hook this sucker up to a larger screen if need be.    I so love this little laptop.  I totally changed platforms.  I used to own a Dell Inspiron 2600.....really great computer but there was always a little something off about it, like it wasn't meant for me but this PowerBook is totally me and I plan to do great things with it.  My creative juices are really starting to flow and I'm starting to feel so confident about this new direction my life is taking.  I've always known that I was supposed to do something where I get to be creative.  I've tried singing, dancing, acting and even dabbled in graphic arts which I still love but this filmmaking thing is the cat's meow.....totally me.    I am also a writer.  I wrote a wonderful novel a couple of years back that I have yet to publish.  I will probably wind up doing self-publishing...it's more my speed.  I'm a writer from way back and I've always written poetry...got into short stories then finally got the courage to do the novel.  It took me approximately 6 months(3-4 days a week in the barnes and noble cafe).  I would go into the cafe, order a frappuccino or hot tea....sit in my little corner and get to writing.  Oh, it felt so good...I miss doing that....it was a great time in my life....that's kind of why I know I'm going in the right direction because I love to write, I love being bossy so I'm perfect for directing and producing....lol!  Anyway, I've yapped for long enough tonight....laters!
I was in a yahoo group for filmmakers in Oklahoma but the bastard had too many rules and I am not one for conformity so I had to jet!  Perhaps, I'll start my own...hell, it can't be any worse....
How good is that song 'The Reason' by Hoobastank.....soooooooo awesome!  I love that guy's voice.  He could sing the alpahbet and make me swoon......
I was supposed to start filming on a documentary today but the subject of my documentary has decided to make other plans.  It totally sucks so I will have to reschedule her for next week but I also have another one for filming next sunday but that should be fairly easy.  It's just this little idea that popped into my head.  It's mostly improv with a few lines provided by moi.  It looks really funny on paper...hoping for that to translate onto film.  alrighty, got to get out and enjoy this day....laters!
Not much going on today but I did happen to catch that cute Citi.com commercial with the little old lady dancing.  It cracks me up so much and more so because the old girl has got a little rhythm.  It's 4am.....I should be in bed but I'm going to watch 'View from the Top' starring Gwyneth Paltrow, Mike Myers and Christina Applegate among others....btw, why is mena suvari, kevin bacon and andie macdowell in 'Beautyshop' the new movie starring Queen Latifah?  Things that make you go hmmm?  laters!
My new favorite show is Aqua Teen Hungerforce on Cartoon Network.....Love It!            urlLink aqua teen hungerforce
We're having a beautiful day in Oklahoma City.  The sun is out but it's Oklahoma City, the weather can change any minute.  It's early in the day and I've worked on two short film scripts.  I'm very excited.  I have two short films ready to shoot and a third almost ready....it'll be ready by Sunday afternoon.  According to Tech TV, friendster.com is so 5 minutes ago.....
I just found out about the American Idol results....I can't believe that Jennifer Hudson got the boot!  Are people crazy?!  I'm not saying that she had the best performance of the night but she certainly did not have the worst one.....Will people please stop feeling sorry for John Stevens!  He's not improving....well, at least his hair is...lol!  He's a one-trick pony and that trick is played out!
What a day!  I currently live in Oklahoma City and I had my first taste of tornadic weather.  I was so scared today.  We had hail ranging from your normal pea size to baseball size.  It was crazy.  A few tornadoes touched down but I wasn't a witness to any but I was very close to the center of the madness today....twice.   I saw collapsed carports....dented vehicles and hail that was two feet deep on some streets....so much hail that it looked like it had snowed.  The biggest news of the day....I got caught in the ice on one street and this guy helped to free me but the truck had so much momentum that it took off and I couldn't catch up as it jumped a curb and landed in someone's yard.....yes, it really happened.  Now my truck is stuck in someone's ice-covered front yard.  The strangest part was that no one was trying to help me.  People were just standing around watching me struggle with my truck.  Finally, one older gentleman came to help me....he recruited two other guys to push my truck as I put the sucker in reverse....All I have to say is......FREE, I'M FREE AT LAST....
I just finished watching American Idol.  Fantasia killed it.  S
