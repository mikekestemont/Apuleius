Wow...this year went by so fast. First year at Claremont's already over, isn't that weird? I mean so many things happened this year and now they're gone, just like that. Strange how life progresses. Life's like the Gravitron. I'm too scared to go on it, and I'm always left outside, looking in. Watching people strapped in, along for the ride while I see them spinning around in a swirling mass of colour. The people inside are the risk-takers. They're willing to grab life by the horns (sorry for the cliche) and be whipped in every direction. No matter how many times they're hurt, they still hold on with everthing they've got. It's scary how fast we age, yet we never really ask why it happens so fast. It just..happens. What is age anyway? You can't feel it, you can't see it, but it's always with you. Kinda like air. It makes you live everyday, makes you strive to achieve anything you want. There's so much we need to know and learn in such a small amount of time. Seeing my brother graduating makes me think about this a little more than I have before. Think about it, we're expected to be married and starting a family by the age of 30. That's only another 15 years away, tops. My first 15 went by quickly, another 15 will come up just as fast. Who knows what things we'll gain or lose by then? Do you actually know what you're life's going to be like later on? No, you don't and you won't until then, but you can steer it in the right direction. Just by observing people, you can tell if they're steering themself in the right direction, and people my age, aren't. It's ironic really. The people that need the most help, don't want to ask for it and don't take things seriously, but the ones that don't need the help, think they need it. Only a few people are smart enough to turn their lives around, but sometimes they figure it out too late. *Sigh* So many things to think about, too many things to ponder, only in one lifetime do you recieve your opportunities.
I hoped to write this sooner but I couldn't get into my account over the weekend for some reason. Anyway, on Friday, I jumped Danny 2'9! Ahhh my highest ever! I've never gone over 2 feet! Yay! I'm still smiling about it ^-^. But that kinda got ruined by my damn science project! Arrgh took me Saturday  and  Sunday to do it! Well, then again, I saw the 3rd Harry Potter movie on Saturday night so that kinda evened it out '^-^. Oh and I'm dancing today at lunch! Infront of the whole school! Ahhh I'm going to sooo mess up! Oh well, doesn't really matter since I'm in the  very  back row! Grr...I'm so topsy-turvy now, but I think this is my way of making things better for myself. I'm starting to see the glass as half full is what they say. I still think I'm somewhere in the middle, like the glass is half empty and half full. Sometimes in my life, it's fuller and sometimes it's more empty, just depends on my day. Everything's chocked full of ups and downs, you just gotta deal with it in your own way I guess. Events happen for a reason, whether you like it or know why they're happening. No one can predict what hurdles you may have to face in the near-future, and it will always remain this way. Destiny doesn't find you, you work your way towards it. I sound like a philosopher or something, don't I? Heh...I'm so weird sometimes...
*Sigh* Yet another family tiff. Great timing. There's too much tension in this house, I need to get out of here for a while. Why does it have to be like this? You'd think we could work stuff out but noooo, we're dysfunctional. Heh, but I'm fine now. I let it all out by yelling my brains out about a certain *ahem* annoying biatch. (Ya'll know who I'm talkin' 'bout) Arrrgh she just wouldn't leave me alone! You'd think she would get the hint by now, geez...It's like everytime you turn around she's there! Lol LEECH!!! But hey, wutcha gunna do with that damn Puddle? She'll do lotsa stuff to you and expect to be liked after she's driven the knife into your back like 20 times. Grrreat...I hate this damn clingy thing. I already have a shadow thank you very much! *Sigh*...I'll never have a normal life. Too many things in the way of one. Well for me anyway. Everyone seems just so happy-go-lucky and here I am sulking. You may be reading this and saying "WTF!?", but this is what's going on in the inside. No one ever sees it, except me. Being happy is so my thing right? Sure, only in school though. When I'm around people I like, all my problems just slip away quietly. Never seen nor thought of when I'm with friends. You guys make me feel waaay better. It's my escape, my sanctuary. You may not realize it, but you guys do a lot for me. For this, I thank you. It's when I'm at home, by myself, that this stuff comes back to haunt me. Sorry Grace, I'm being too serious aren't I? Well, my life  is  serious so there's no helping it. That's all I got to say for now so, peace up, A-town. (Lol, I'm so cool, don't you dare say otherwise!)
Weird weather we're having...I swear it matches my moods all the time! This morning was so crappy when we played colours, then it got prettyful this afternoon. I felt really gross this morning too, then I was happy, now I'm blah. Uckyful feelings. *Sigh* So many things to think about, so many opportunities slipped past me...Feels like I've been flipped upside down, shaken for all I'm worth and have just been set upright again. Trying to find your bearings is hard, especially a
