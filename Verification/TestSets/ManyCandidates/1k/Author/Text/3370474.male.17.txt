I'm sorry for everything.
So...I already have a livejournal. Now I have a blogger thingy. Hmm. I should use this blogger thingy to....post like....quiz results...or....something dumb like that! or or...random....stuff. Indeed.
la la la.
Once upon a golden century The world had shattered into immortal debris  Battles rage upon the cold earth Her stare forced me into spiritual rebirth Many lives were laid to rest Across her chest was blessed the crest of the dead  Caring not for my own life My wings spread and I flew to her side Staring at me she spoke  "Fear not what you cannot stop  Close your eyes and feel your body drop"    Thats all for now.  I cannot seem to think at this moment, I know not why.  Enjoy.
Oh sweetest of angels, where art thou? I need release from this cold world, this fake world.  All I see is lies.  All we ever hear about are lies.  I wish these thoughts would just go away.  I cannot take living this way.  Oh sweet baby Jesus, do thou not hear me?
Why can I not stop this suppressed pain?  So long has it been suppressed, it wants out.  It wants to make me bleed, the blood, an ever flowing river of negativity, bleed.  I can feel it starting to pull me down, deeper and deeper into the halls of despair.    Oh saviour, I beg to thee, save me from my hell....
Death and Decay fills this land As I take hold of death's cold hand We embrace in the cold summers night I can feel upon my skin the cold ice Death, take me away from this pain It keeps whispering my unholy name I am confounded to my bed As blood slowly rushes to my head
Hello fellow Renegade Angels; I have returned.  I have returned, but with no memories of anything that came to pass, nor of the terrible deeds that I might have once committed.  I, we, are now one.  I remember only but a thing, it is us we, of us.  Of me and him, Him and I, us, the demons.....
Alas, I have returned.  I could not make the razor enter my broken skin.  Its soft touch made me whisper things in my head.  So many bad memories rushed in, making me feel like as if I am nothing more but a mindless drone.  I thought of my mixture of untimely poisons, but something, or someone was holding me back from consuming its sweet taste.  What has happened to me? Why could I not enter the razor deeply within me? Why could I not carve away my life? Why could I not consume my poison?   I live now for another few days, until I regain the strength to attempt a new sacrifice.  We need the sweet touch of a crystal blade upon our open flesh.  We must be punished.
This is all we shall post for the day.  Our eyes become dreary from all the tears that have fallen upon the damp plains, and we fear that death is imminent.  We shall return to you, if death does not get its way with us.  Good day, and may the forsaken heavens bless you all.
I need to be alone.  Forget everything about this life, just rest forever.  Forget about all my memories; forget all the possibilities that may still linger.  My soul was taken from me along time ago, I cannot even remember when it was.  My heart is lost, confused, broken and shattered.  I am so alone.  When all this had began, I hoped I was the only one feeling this pain, for it is unbelievable and unreal that someone can feel all this hurt inside.  I’ve wanted to find something I’ve wanted all my life, true love, someone that cared for me.  She came too late.  I am feeling hallow.  Often my wrists have bled there crimson tears, but never did anybody notice.  My wounds cried so many times.  Screaming for someone to heal them, my heart constantly trying to keep me breathing, but without the willingness, I cannot grant it that one wish.  The emptiness of my life, a void that has yet to be filled.  I’m paranoid.  I’m uptight.  I feel like everyone is always watching me, staring at me, waiting for me to do something wrong.  Now that I have you're full attention, you are going to hear me out, like it or not.  I hate everyone that breath's except for a chosen few.  I hate everything about this world, from the smallest bug to the biggest tree, I hate it all.  I often wonder why I hear voices, why I never put my pain on display, or ever set it free.  Instead of letting my pain, my anguish free, I let it form deep within me, let it become me.  I am my pain, and my pain is me.  It never goes away, they never leave.  Haunting me for age's it seems.  I have tried to cut them out, tried to cry them out.  I opened my sounds, bleed them out.  Nothing worked, the only way to calm them was to take pills, to feed the urges.  I am so confused; I don’t know what’s worth fighting for.  Why do I scream? Why do I breath?  I finally found a cure.  Death.  Felo-De-Se.  The act of self annihilation.  I often say things that I don’t mean, but at the same time, I mean them.  Tonight I am taking my own life, painting my pain on my walls.  Blood is the letters, crimson regret is my clarity.  I have fallen into a hopeless black void.  I cannot stop my fall; tonight I shall meet the devils advocate.  I cant trust anybody.  All truth slips through the cracks in the ground, and the lies, being bigger than the truth, and in stronger numbers, is all the stays in my lost mind.  I will no longer waste myself on you.  Who is you? You is whoever is reading this, you are hardly worth my time or breath.  If you are Jill, I love you and y
