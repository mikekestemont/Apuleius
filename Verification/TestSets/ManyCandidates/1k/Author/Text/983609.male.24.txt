Tradition   Every Halloween week, since I could remember, I've always watch the Peanuts Special on the Great Pumpkin.  Long live Sparky.  Your cartoons are still great.  I hope that I will spend time watching the Halloween and Christmas specials with my kids some day.  Or at least with my wife.
Bridge School Benefit   Big Sur, Bridge School, and San Francisco were all great this weekend.  We had a fun night of frolicking drunk in the trees and then woke up with pounding heads yet happy hearts.  We even saw zebras on the roadside yet I think they were only zonkeys.  We ate outside the entrance of a Ralphs and looked liked vagrants to the old women with their stink faces and evil eyes.  The Bridge School show had awful sound but there were some cool parts.  Wilco was great, they played to Woody Guthrie songs, including Jesus Christ for President, and three of their own.  Counting Crows was ok, they covered Friend of the Devil by the Grateful Dead.  Pearl Jam was awesome. I am officially back on the PJ train after that show.  They sounded the best and brought the best mojo to the show.  They opened with the most haunting version of Dylan's Masters of War that I've ever heard, and then went to couple of their own songs.  They then then played 25 seconds to go by Cash and I nearly jumped out of my pants.  Mass repect to PJ for that.  Then Willie Nelson came on and he was completely stoned.  It was a great set.  CSN&Y finished things off and were great as well.  We then drove to our hotel room and happened to cover inch of floorspace that was available except the tub.   We woke up and went to San Francisco to walk a lot and eat bad Chinese food.  We then road back to SoCal on our horses to see the hills on fire.  I know so many people affected by these fires.  I know a couple guys in Simi, five in the mist of the San Diego blazes, and about 10 families in the Big Bear/Arrowhead/Crestline area.  It's incredible to think that so much of the mountains in San Bernadino are gone and entire towns could be wiped out.  I'm going to be praying a lot today.  I think a lot of people are.    I'm going to get comments on this site soon.

Big Sur   Tomorrow I'm going to Big Sur to camp before the   urlLink Bridge School Benefit  show on Saturday.  I did this last year and the time spent was incredible.  It should be a fun go around this time as well.             urlLink
Welcome   I have a new blogspot for the all of you who care.  Most of the stuff that will be written in here will be complete shite but hopefully something interesting will come up.    Cheers
I Hate This Computer   I'm writing to y'all from a broken, open computer that only seems to want to turn on once every twenty times I try.  So I'll make things quick.  Updates: 1) Got a girlfriend, seriously.  She's great, she's cute.  I'm lucky.  I don't want to screw this up.  2) I thought I was working for Best Buy but they never call to work.  They're all flakes. Now I'm trying to go Radio Shack.  If Best Buy doesn't want me, I'll go straight to their competition.  3) I got an interview with this shady company that I soon found out was  a pyramid scheme.  I spent most of the day in Oxnard trying to sell electronics items at wholesale prices.  I felt like I was scaming people.  I probably was.  Still looking for honest work.  4) A couple of my friends are now in jail, in Oregon.  It's a crazy situation.  More on this later.  Other than this stuff, life is still the same in Burbank.  Boring.  I need to win the Lottery.  So I could travel and open a nice bar.  I'd called it O'Sycz's.  I know, it's not that catchy.
G.I. Joe Mama   My friend Kristin sent me this  urlLink link  where somebody dubbed over G.I. Joe public service annoucements.  I'm warning you right now that before you click on any of these clips, you should should use the proper facilities because you will piss your pants.  You have been warned.
Old Zoo   My sister Jen took me to the  urlLink Old Zoo  in Griffith Park yesterday.  I always wanted to see it because I heard about the old cages there ffrom the 1930s and all the old tagging.  I was disappointed to see the Parks Services paint over all the graffii.  So if you feel marking some walls and cages up, I would encourage you to go with some friends and have at it there.  The sis and I did hike a lot in the hills and ventured around other areas of the park that I haven't seen for years.    It's really cold in house right now.  My room, since it is an old addition, doesn't have proper insulation and I can usually see my own breath in the mornings.  I think I'm going to fire up the portable heater to keep me warm tonight.  But I can't complain.  This weather is way better than 100 degree heat.
Comments!!!   I have conquered the internet.  Make comments to my boring, stupid posts.  Make me feel humbled with your witty, sarcastic, barbs that reveal how weak I really am.
New Email Address   Those yahoo bastards deactivated my email address so I got a new one.  It's mikesycz@hotmail.com.  Drop me a line so I can rebuild my address book.    Cheers
Halloweener   I went down to Whittier for all pagan's day.  And as a long standing tradition, I disappointed myself with my lack of effort in my choice of costume.  I paid $15 for the worst priest outfit I could find and had a holy water container filled with whiskey.  The guys at the bayou decided to throw a small party that turned into a rockin bash.  If you can imagine a party being thrown in N
