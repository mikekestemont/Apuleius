So far:  Self proclaimed smartest man in the world. Jarvis Cocker. Samuel L. Jackson.
Well I'm at Dom's house (NTHELL have screwed my box up).  I'm watching Big Brother and the rundown on the new housemates is, well, a bunch of nutters:  There's a lesbian, a sex-changer, a guy in a thong, someone pretending to look like Samuel L Jackson in the Barclay's advert, a posh girl amongst others.  Channel 4 have gone full stops to make these guys hate each other, they have limited beds (two members have to share a double), one of them will not be having their suitcase .  It's certainly more interesting than last year.  Though I loath most reality TV, BB does have an attraction this, simply because there's a chance they'll try and take each other out with blunt objects.  See you all later.

She is dippy but seems ok. Mind you, I have been wrong before.
They have picked a bunch of people who will clearly drive each other nuts in a very short space of time. They seem to be ignoring each other but shouting at the moment. Looking hopeful. First tension, noone seems to want to share Jason's bed.
This review of Real LifeTM (one of the oldest and  persistent multiplayer role-playing games) was originally posted on GameSpot a  year or so back.&nbsp; I just found it while clearly out some old text files on  my Palm.&nbsp; It sounds a really good game, I think it's still going, so maybe  a few of us should give it a try?      &nbsp;    ---      &nbsp;    Volumes have already been written about real life,  the most accessible and most widely accepted massively multiplayer online  role-playing game to date. Featuring believable characters, plenty of lasting  appeal, and a lot of challenge and variety, real life is absolutely  recommendable to those who've grown weary of all the cookie-cutter games that  have tried to emulate its popularity--or to just about anyone, really.   &nbsp; Real life is densely populated and features a wide variety of  places to explore and activities to engage in.     &nbsp;    Real life isn't above reproach. In one of the  stranger design decisions in the game, for some reason you have no choice in  determining your character's initial starting location, appearance, or gender,  which are chosen for you seemingly at random. However, over the course of your  character's life, you have tremendous opportunity to customize and define a  truly unique appearance for yourself--not only can you fine-tune your hairstyle  and hair color, but you can also purchase and wear a seemingly infinite variety  of clothing and influence your body type using various in-game mechanisms. For  example, if your character exercises frequently, you will appear fit and  muscular. You may also choose from a huge variety of tattoos and body piercings,  and later you can even pay for cosmetic surgery, though this is expensive and  there's a small chance that the operation will backfire. At any rate, real life  offers a truly remarkable amount of variety in determining your character's  outward appearance, and this depth isn't only skin deep. The only problem is  you're relegated to playing as a human character, though the game does randomly  choose one of several different races for you (which have little bearing on  gameplay and mostly just affect appearances and your standing with certain  factions).     &nbsp;    The gameplay itself is extremely open-ended, though  it's structured in such a way that you'll have a fairly clear path to follow  when you're just starting out. Real life features a great system whereby newbie  players will automatically be guided along through the early levels by one or  more "parent" characters who elect to take newbie characters under their wing.  This is a great system, as these older, more-experienced characters reap their  own benefits from doing a good job of guiding the newbie character along. The  system does have some problems, though--sometimes you'll encounter "griefer"  parents who shirk their responsibilities or, even worse, seem content to harass  newbie players. Such a situation could, in theory, irreparably damage your  experience in real life. Fortunately, chances of this are relatively slim, as a  harsh punitive system is in place to prevent the vast majority of players from  experiencing or engaging in this sort of behavior.  &nbsp; Starting out in  real life can admittedly be boring, but the experience becomes much more  interesting and open-ended once you get past the learning curve.     &nbsp;    Typically, a character will learn of the numerous  viable career paths available by undergoing schooling. This can be a long and  tedious process, equivalent to the sort of "level treadmill" monotony that  characterizes almost all MMORPGs. Nevertheless, many players do manage to enjoy  themselves in this phase, especially if they band together--real life definitely  rewards players who join groups, though soloing is certainly an option as well.  At any rate, through the schooling process, as you engage in various activities,  you eventually settle on a career path, and this is when you can start making a  good amount of money and really taking matters into your own hands.      &nbsp;    There are a few known exploits for making money,  but generally the game's financial system is well balanced, complex, and  rewarding for those who put forth proportionally more effort. You can use money  to acquire new and better clothing, your own custom housing (a tremendous  variety of options are available here as well), and new means of transportation  ranging from bicycles to automobiles and beyond, and you can even employ other  players and some non-player characters to do your bidding. Most notably, certain  actions in real life are necessary and yet require a considerable amount of  expertise to perform, or are simply boring. Additionally, even if you do have  expertise in a field, that doesn't mean you can perform a given task for  yourself--in this way, real life encourages and even forces player interaction,  so those who prefer to go solo might find themselves in a bind at times. For  example, even if your character specializes in dentistry, that doesn't mean y
