While online looking at Pokemon episode guides I found out about Pokemon Housou translated it means Pokemon Broadcast in english which is separate show from the actual Pokemon TV series, which shows what goes on in other places while Ash is away in Hoenn. This show currently airs only in Japan.  It appears to be a good cartoon series only thing now is for it to air in the USA and UK in english other than that all we can do is wait and see if they will begin airing the episodes or if tey will just stick with the current Pokemon Advance. First Aired December 2002 on Japanese TV on Tuesdays at 7:00 PM.
As you may or may not know Trini.com is a local Trinidad and Tobago website.   The problem is that it used to be a good site at one point but recently (2 months ago) it just seems to be going down the drain when it comes to its services such as it's SMS or Chat services.  Currently I don't have any anti-spyware software installed to trap these spyware programs, so I was using their SMS service which I was used to using for some time now but when I tried to send my message it would just stop and go to a next page full of pop-ups and ads.  And if that is not bad enough it installs a hand full of harmful programs on your system such as Keylogers, Trojans and Spyware.  Eventhough I have Norton Antivirus 2004 on my system and the Google toolbar that is supposed to block ads they did'nt even detect it eventhough I have the latest version of both.  The only solution that their is don't visit the site or make sure that you have Anti-Spyware software installed.
Today I bought Mario vs Donkey Kong for the GBA after looking online for it all week and I think that now i am addicted to it.  It is one of the best games I have ever played eventhough it is on a small screen the graphics are good and the sound is better with voices and cut scenes it is worth owning I would say yes to anyone who is thinking of buying it.  So I will give it a 5 out of 5 but that is just me, leave you comments and tell me what you think...

GameFAQ's recently had some news about the possible pricing of the upcoming PlayStation 3 and PSP. The PSP may cost approx $250 and games selling for $30 a pop. "Sony is considering adding PSX and TiVo-like functionality to the PlayStation 3. And if it does, the sticker price on the unit could climb as high as $500.
I have recently visited G4Techtv's Kevin Rose website and saw that he talked about http://www.allofmp3.com/.  A Russian site which allows you to download music (mp3's) and Music Albums, Kevin says "They seem to offer a ton of albums in like 10 different high end audio codecs."  I visited the site but found that it was a cool site but it was the way TheScreenSavers said never use Kazaa to download music again.  The said that it was the kazaa killer, I think that it was such a broad statement that still no matter which option you use they are both border line the law.  So take you pick?
