An Interview that appears on Simon and Schuster's website...   A Conversation with Sarahbeth Purcell     Q: What inspires you to write, and why did you choose to develop this story in particular?   A: I was asked this question at a book signing that, with all the great questions, turned into a wonderful two hour discussion with readers in Atlanta a short time ago. I realized that very minute as I was explaining myself that those sort of exchanges are what inspire me to write. Conversations, ideas passed back and forth, thoughts that trickle in and out. Never something one hundred percent real. I write when I need to only. I can't write simply out of duty, and I refuse to write anything that I don't have a passion about.   Love is the Drug was a difficult story to write, but my father was ill and I decided in order to protect myself from the pain, as I often did when I was a little girl, I would imagine the worst case scenario and make up a story from that, to escape what was really happening. This book, first and foremost, was merely a survival tool. Just like when I was in high school and people teased me and I was miserable. My only escape then was theatre, music and writing so I could pretend my life at the time didn't exist.     Q: Tyler is a very strong personality. Have you ever known anyone like her? Are any of the events in this story adapted from real life?   A: There are similarities with events that happened in Tyler's childhood and events that happened in mine. I certainly used things as inspiration, but never never never used anyone else as a way to get my story across. I have to give myself more credit than that as an artist. I know of a lot of artists whether they be authors or painters or songwriters or playwrights that use their frustration, their failed relationships and anger at negative situations in their life as ammunition, as subject matter, and to me it's not an option. I don't have any respect for artists who do this, and I wouldn't respect myself if I did it. It's vampirism, pure and simple, to use people who are in or have moved out of your life and sell it to the highest bidder. Plus, to me, it would mean I had no real creativity, if I couldn't create something that didn't exist.   So yes, there are certain similarities but mostly in an interesting way I've only recently discovered: After I had written thoughts down as I was writing the book, some of the opinions and ideas became my own. I started quoting Tyler when I was having conversations with people. So I sort of stole from Tyler, not the other way around. I didn't create Tyler to be a stronger or weaker version of myself or to get back at a lover who scorned me, or to be a very sexual person by proxy and curse like a sailor and get away with it by claiming it's all a character. It's my belief that Tyler sort of always existed and I just told her story. And I admire her quite a lot, despite her weaknesses.     Q: Music and writing are both very important to Tyler. Do you think one of these media is more powerful than the other, or do they have different strengths? Which is more important to you?   A: I recently wrote an essay for Powell's about just this subject matter and I'll reiterate my point: Modern fiction today is so much more "punk rock" than music ever will be again. Musicians and songwriters tend to get so much overrated admiration or aberration, and so much attention, so of course authors end up being the glue that holds art together while the rockers get glory and ego strokes. I grew up in the music business and it's always been that way. Media isn't what it used to be. Eminem gets flack for controversial subject matter but no one really pays attention to what authors are writing unless it becomes a movie or it's by the "monarchy" of writers (Stephen King, John Grisham, J K Rowling, etc.) So the writers like myself who are a bit underground can actually change the very nature of the way a book is written and what is acceptable subject matter without being blocked by book burnings or too much negative attention. I love that I can mention music in the book and make the story about so much more than that as well. Music is like a spring of parsley while the story in a book is the whole bowl of hummus.  I've written songs and I've written books and I'll tell you immediately it is a hell of a lot more difficult to write a book. There are more elements to it. It's more cerebral. You have to be able to put a sentence together to do it. You have to have coherence. It's not a fast food version of a story like a song is. It doesn't matter if the author is young or old. Image means very little in the general scheme of things. Your gender doesn't matter. Of course, there are similarities between the two mediums and I do seek out music that resembles the books I like to read. Full of layers. Whether it's a book or a song, it can't just be about love. It can't just be about death. I hate over simplified love stories or songs. How much has that been overdone at this point? So he left you and you're lonely. Boo-hoo. Tell a story people haven't heard before in some new way people haven't heard it. That is what I've always tried to do.     Q: Tyler's lists are fun to read, and drive some of the plot in the second half of the book. Did you find it difficult to work within that framework after awhile, or did that device help you?    A
