Nothing of interest has happened yet. Just thought you'd like to know.
Ever get paint on the clothes of your department's director? Yeah, that's how my night went. Maybe I should start carrying a bucket of cold water with me? Just in case I see the need to drown myself on a moment's notice.
Have you ever noticed how what one generation grew up with becomes kitsch for the next generation? Today, I went shopping for a Messenger Bag (ended up having an eye exam instead, but that's a different story). In my search, I walked by two displays. One was an Old Navy display that had old Route 66 type slogans and adverts on them. The type of things my parents would have seen on television as they were watching 1950's TV. The second was a Hot Topic display. On sale there were t-shirts advertising Transformers, not the new crappy show mind you, but the old, "Me Grimlock, you lunch" Transformers. Somehow, I wonder why kids, and let's face it, if anyone over the age of 14 walked into a Hot Topic for any other reason than to apply for a job, I'd be amazed; would want to wear a t-shirt from a show they've never seen. Maybe I'm just getting old.
Yesterday, I really had the urge to get out of my ridiculously small apartment and go somewhere. So, I decided to head downtown and visit Chinatown. After all, I hadn't been to Chinatown in while and figured I could pick up some good Pot Stickers. Okay kiddies, the next time I get the urge to go somewhere, for God's sake, please shoot me.       Within 5-minutes of walking in through the Grant Street entrance, I realized why it had been so long since my last visit.... the Tourists. Yes, the dreaded Tourists. And since it's summer over here in the States, that means that a whole mess load of Tourists, complete with little brats, were running around, going in and out of the shops screaming their little lungs off.       "Mommy, Daddy, I want one of these."     "Uh, honey, that's not a toy."     "But look, it says Hello Kitty on it, and it vibrates!"     *stoned silence*     (NB: I actually overheard this conversation)       Next time I go to Chinatown, I'm going at night, for food, or the Chinese New Year parade.
They're small, colored, although the old ones are mostly white, and hold vast amounts of music, information, and even some games. In my life, I've seen some great things: The personal computer, the Internet, the Mariners with a winning season, the rise and fall of the PDA, cellular phones, readily available Anime in the US, another winning season for the Mariners, the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, free webcomics, Spider-Man 1 and 2, etc, etc....       But the I-Pod is the first that I've never wanted to leave home without. Easy to use, easy to update, convenient, and well, cool. I feel 10+ cooler just wearing one and I'm one of those people who projects an invisible shield that automatically repels people. I'm not even that big of a Mac person (though I do admit a secret love for their laptops). Too damn cool. On the other hand, maybe it's just because it's still a relatively new toy for me. Maybe, after a few months, I'll get tired of it and relegate it to the "there but barely used pile of electronics." Then again, maybe not.         On a completely unrelated note. I'm wondering if the the term "Windows XP" isn't a code of some sort. Something like XP stands for eXperience Points and windows is a English translation for the number of points needed to de-bug the damn system, which would be: 239,144,152,319 eXperience Points. Crap, I don't think I'm there yet.     Today's link:  urlLink  Fun with Music
I'm at work right now, which means that I shouldn't be typing this. Quite frankly, I don't care, no one here is every going to see this anyhow. Now, how can I put this.... I'm bored, bored, bored, bored, bored, bored.   Working nights is a pain in the arse. Working nights on the weekends is like getting violated in places where the sun does not shine. I could be out on the town, meeting girls, having fun, drinking heavily, but no; I'm here, at work, high on caffeine, and full from Chin... oh, crap, someone's coming in.     5-minutes later: Okay, he's gone. Anyway, as I was saying: high on caffeine and full from the plate of Chinese style Pot Stickers. My supervisor is giving a promotion's test, so I'm basically running the show for the time being, which is cool, except that I'd rather be getting a lot more money for the job. Late.     &nbsp;   01:23, 07/25/2004&nbsp; Sometimes, I really hate this job. Everything was nice and quiet and then.... boom! I've spent the last hour on the phone and radio talking back and forth, basically acting as a go-between for three different groups of people. There are times when I wish I could just roll over and go to sleep, sleepy, sleepy, sleep.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *zzzzzzzzzzzzzz*
You ever have one of those days where you just can't go to sleep? No matter how tired you are? It is now 10:17 on a Saturday morning and I've been up since 05:00 on Friday. In between, I've closed my eyes for about 20-minutes.... tops. I'm so tired that the world is spinning and everything is begining to fall apart before my very eyes. The 6th Cav painting above my futon... upside down. The Irish flag, now starting to look vaguely British.      Okay, so It's partially my fault. I mean, I supposed I could go to sleep if I just lay my head down on my pillow and closed my eyes. Two problems. One: Caffeine. I have more caffeine in my veins than blood. This isn't a new problem mind you. It's just one that affects me from time to time.     Two:   urlLink  Strange Candy.      This comic will kill your brain, and make you laugh hysterically.
