* My name is Amrita Das, Amrita Mathur, Amrita Das Mathur, Ammu.&nbsp;  * I was born on January 8, 1979, in Cuttack, Orissa. In the eastern side of India into a dysfunctional family.   * I am Indian - a half Punjabi, half Oriya married to a Rajasthani Kayasth.   * My only sibling is my pain-in-the-arse elder brother who is married to a rather nice lady.   * I am passionate about reading: currently reading - Don’t stand too close to a naked man – the autobiography of Tim “the tool man” Allen. Did you know his last name is “Dick”?   * I love summer sunshine, clear blue skies and green grass.   * I like it when it rains coz then I can have pakoras with my chai and get gooey in the head.   * I am very fat, I have always wanted to taller and thinner.   * I hated school coz no one understood me – I was always the weird kid.   * I actually studied in college and got a scholarship. Egad! College is also where I met my security blanket – Apoorva.   * I am an official law-school dropout.   * I have made a career out of nothing at all. I trade words for green paper.   * The person who got me into writing was my college professor – Dr Mukesh Williams, who also made the world’s best green ginger tea.   * When I dated Apoorva I used to be so nervous I could not eat in front of him. So he would eat and I would watch.   * Later we swapped roles, now I comfort eat and he watches.   * I am obsessive about socks – especially coloured ones with funny graphics – my favourite one right now is a dark blue pair with a black white cow on the side and it says - party till the cows come home.   * I play Scrabble online and offline. I love it!   * I love taking pictures with my little digital camera – because there is no reel or processing charge just need to charge the batteries and I am good to go.   * My Nana used to take me to the British Council Library during my summer holidays and I still am a member even here in Dubai. Every two weeks I like a good child go return books and rent books.   * I used to like drinking beer till Vodka happened to me.   *&nbsp;I have had some crummy jobs and then a yummy boss and a dream job at Netaphase.   * I love to paint. I am not good at it and feel sheepish about my creations. It is a compulsive disorder.   * I like to drink lots of chai – Lipton Yellow, English Breakfast or Makaibari Bio-dynamic when I am truly feeling haalloo. Especially after my meals.   * The only coffee I like is Starbucks – Café Mocha – for that chocolaty zing.   * I have a sweet tooth. I also like all baked products – croissants and lemon tarts. No wonder I am fat.   * I am moody and can be quite nasty when I am down in the dumps.   * I am a cleanliness maniac who once in a while sacks out only to come back with a vengeance.   * I have an acid scar on my right arm and a wax burn on my left leg – both very painful experiences. They say I would be considered brave in Germany.   * I remember things in minute detail – yes, you are so-and-so, born there-and-there and when I met you - you were wearing pink shoes, if you get the drift! Especially the details and plan of the house I grew up in SO.10, Cantonment Road, Cuttack.   * Sadly I remember birth months rather than dates.   * I love dogs and can get extremely emotionally attached to them.   * I write long letters to my Nana, who writes back equally long letters to me.   * I adore some of my cousins to bits.   * People with no sense of humour and a value for money attitude tire me.   * I like colour. Does that make me rangeela? Aha! Everything in my world is colourful. – Vivid bright shades, especially of the blue, green genre.   * I enjoy watching funny meaningful movies like Raffoo Chakkar, Golmaal, Dil Chahta Hai, Bend it like Beckham, Lost in Translation. Humour should be used to communicate a host of emotions including loneliness and loss.   * I’ve quit smoking. I’ve quit a few times before - my longest non-smoking stretch was a year and a half and hopefully this will be forever. But every once in awhile I get extremely tempted.   * I enjoy cooking and baking – I like the radio playing in the background when I am in the kitchen.   * I am very particular about my shoes and bags. Always spend on that and on perfumes – Narcissus, Red, 7th Avenue, Green Tea, Woman…sigh!   * I love herbal skin care products by Clarins, Body Shop and Biotique. I have an entire ritual before I sleep and Apoorva loves imitating me.   * I love stationery shops and bookstores. I like buying sharpeners, erasers, notebooks and pencils.   * I love Ikea and their furniture. That is one shop where I land up spending loads of the green paper.   * I like marmite on toast. It works for me especially well when I am all sulky.   * I am emotional, sensitive, protective and possessive with my close friends.   * One of my fears is my computer crashing. It has happened to me once and it ate lots of my work.   *&nbsp;I am scared of heights, the dark, ghosts and clowns.   * I grew up reading the Sesame Street Dictionary and Walt Disney’s Fairytales. On television I used to watch Tom and Jerry (VHS) and Chitrahaar on Doordarshan.   * I want to learn Arabic to know what the lyrics in the songs, how to drive without banging into things and swim like a fish.   * I have coloured my hair several t
