I've spent the last hour or so reading other people's posts. Some made me laugh, some made me smile, some mad eme jealous and several were just empty for me.   Then I came back and read my own - trying to see what picture of myself I had drawn to the anonymous stranger reading me.   I realize now what a distorted image it is.  In my posts, I sound unhappy. Unfulfilled.  I sound like a woman obsessed with her career and what people think of her (and to those who could read my Hebrew poems - with sex).   Is that really who I am?   An acquaintance who had read my posts said they were very ... "me". Are they really?   Because when I re-read them, I don't think they reflect the myriad of who I am. This bolg displays my insecruties. And I olny write when I am depressed, or concerned, or unstable.  I think that is the reason this blog will never really mirror who I am. I don't come here when I feel loved and protected (which I do, every day). I don't come here when I'm content. ther's no point in writing then. I revel in my hapiness then.   So no, these posts are not me. They are one piece of me. The piece that needs to be put in writing for me to acknowledge it, to dissect it and analyze it, to udnerstand it better.  That other piece - the strong, secure, beautiful, loving piece? That one is out there in the real world.
My new SE (I'll call him Harry) is.... well.... stupid. I can't find another word for it. Not stupid as as in lacking knowledge. But stupid as in lacking... emotional IQ. Maturity. He is obnoxious. He is annoying. He is scattered. He is... well...  repulsive.   I feel bad for him. He has a sweet 2 year old daughter and a wife that moved all the way to this city for him to take this job.  He's really trying to be good. Making an effort.  But every meeting with him is a disaster.  Every customer... I can tell... is "rubbed the wrong way" by Harry.   I know he feels uncofmortable with having a 26 year old as his boss (He is in his late thirties). I know he doesn't like working with someone who has less experience in the industry then he does (heck, when he was already working as an SE I was barely in high school).  So he disrespects me. And he dislikes me. And he makes sure that's known.   But I am the one in charge. I get to decide his future. My word is valued and if I say he's gone - the he's gone.  (In the army, a commander can chose who will "carry his weapons", who he trusts. In the sales team, a sales executive can chose their SE).   I feel bad for Harry - I know he might not deserve this. But he's got to go. I can't work him.  Four months is a long time to give someone "a shot"... right?   Right?

If I work less...I'll be happy If I dance more... I'll be happy If I read more, if I rest more, if I help more...  Never quite there. Never quite happy.

My tales so delicate -  a spider's web.  Easily torn if investigated.   And yet so beautiful and intricate,  You get sucked in.   Captivated.

I wish I could identify what makes a day an "awake" day... I wish I could dissect the factors and pinpoint the exact combination of parameters: is it someone I spoke with, something I wore, a song I heard, an achievement I reached, something somebody said, the weather, the time I woke up or went to sleep, whether I made love...  Today was one of these days.  Today is almost over.
פוטנציאל לא ממומש  כמו אקדח טעון ונצור, כמו שאגה בחדר אטום, כמו חץ שאל הקשת קשור, כמו בבושקה שמנועה מלקום,   כך הרצון שבי להושיט יד ולגעת וללטף את צוארך הרכון, השאיפה להתקרב אליך עוד צעד מנוגד לטבע, אך מתרצה למצפון.

I am going to get a guy fired. Not out of revenge (although it defnitely serves him right for being such an ASS). He is not good enough - professionally speaking. And he is not a team player.  So I'm going to get him fired. Life's a bitch.
He didn't write. He didn't IM. He didn't call.   He's not my lover, my friend or my colleague. He barely ever was.   But it's him, that nobody, ignoring me - that is driving me up the wall.
Better to write for yourself and have no public, than to write for the public and have no self.  Cyril Connolly (1903 - 1974)
The assignment is not that complicated - a small assembler program that encrypts a string based on a given algortihm.  I've written programs way more difficult. This used to be a joke.  My rusty brain can't even comprehend the basics now.
I hate to think of myself as shallow - but after my weekly conversation with Mom last night - I am begining to realize I probably am.     To those who don't know me, I am sure I am the epitomy of depth and sophistication. After all, I am well-read, well-versed, well-dressed.  But to those who know me, I am just M
