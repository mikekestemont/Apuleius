In one of the shops that we explored this morning, the proprietor apologized for the "upset" in front. We looked out for an accident of some kind, but he referred to the street which was torn up, preparatory to paving with blocks of some Australian wood which was guaranteed to last  twenty  years!  We said that we were perfectly used to that sort of thing as it was always going on in New York. At first he didn't catch the "New" and seemed surprised at what we said. After some talk, he found that we were from America, when he said "Well I thought you didn't speak like Yorkshire". This was at a stationer's and library; and we were shown into a little back parlor and seated when we asked for souvenir postcards. It was almost like a social call, but we finally purchased some and went in search of the P.O.  On the street, a large square two-wheeled cart, in which sat a very stout woman, was being drawn by a tiny donkey, not as high as the dash board, nor half as big as the stolid driver. But he trotted cheerfully along with his load.  The famous-English-complexion mystery is solved. When you come near those beautiful rosy cheecks, you find them to be on the same principle as a red nose - simply a congested condition of the capillaries, due no doubt to the heavy eating and drinking. It looks very well - at a distance - when the proud beauty is youthful, but towards middle life it becomes purple and mottled and apoplectic and all such things. America is safe, yet a while.  When the paper hanger came to the house, he handed my sister a package and asked her if she would please "hot" his tea. The package contained about a small cup of dry tea and some large crystals of raw sugar, and he explained that he would like to have it about the middle of the morning.  As the household teapot is very small, holding only two cups, she hastened to carry up the decoction, saying that she was afraid it would be rather strong, but he assured her that it was "quite right". "Thank you" is the response for everything - rising inflection on the "you".  We were referred to the draper's, the chemist's and the green grocer's, and saw no barber shops - only "Gentleman's Hairdressing Saloons". Fare on the tram cars is a penny.  The ruins of Birkenhead Priory, now partly restored as St. Mary's Church (Anglican), are out toward the river.  Dating from 1150, it is of late Norman architecture, showing the beginnings of Gothic in the slightly pointed arches, springing from a central pillar.  We were shown the crypt under the refectory which was unroofted, and the ground floor of the chapel. Here and there on the moss covered ground, lay fragments of stone carvings. The old fireplace could be traced - no chimney rising from it: there had been a hood and flue to carry off the smoke through the kitchen. One old stone bore an inscription in curious Latin, telling of the burial of a beloved prior in 1473.  The new church was behind the ruins, which are zealousy guarded and very proudly shown by a special keeper.

We landed at 8:30 and went to the custom inspection office, where the baggage was arranged in heaps, alphabetically, so that one could readily find his own and be ready to open it when the official appeared. The examination is very perfunctory and we were in there less than half an hour.  A ferry brings one to Birkenhead, the residence of many Liverpool business people. Lines of tram cars meet the boats - small affairs (the cars), with seats on top - but very nice to ride in.  It is a comparatively new town and looks not unlike ours, only the buildings are so low, small and all of brick or stone. Most of the dwellings are enclosed by low walls, and a hedge inside.  20 Maple St. is brick with ivy over the front and a brass knocker on the door. In each room is an open grate, and in the kitchen, a range for soft coal. You cook over an open fire in the middle, and the oven on the left is heated by coals pushed under it. On the right is the hob where a kettle or pot may stand and simmer.   The kitchen and scullery floors are of red and white tiles, and the latter has a copper kettle set it masonry, under which a fire is to be built.  Although there is gas in the house, we lighted a candle and set it on the little mantel of our bedroom at bed time, and felt really in England.
This was a day of days, for it gave us our first glimpse of foreign shores.  It was light very early, entering St. George's Channel, and about four o'clock, the early risers were excitedly walking on the deck and scanning the horizon. Soon it came into view - the southern shores of Ireland, rising in steep cliffs from the water. At first, in the gray morning light, these heather-crowned steeps looked very desolate. For miles, not a house could be seen; only the rugged rocky shore with here and there an old gray square stone tower rising from some headland. These were watch towers, where in the old days a lookout was kept for smugglers who would bring liquors and tobacco from Spain. The lighthouses were a feature of the coast. The tower, surrounding buildings and enclosing wall, were all white, stood out clearly against the rich dark green background. Fastness Light is on a small rock island, off the coast. Gallyhead is on a
