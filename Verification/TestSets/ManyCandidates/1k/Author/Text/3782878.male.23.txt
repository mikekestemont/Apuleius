There came a day that I was told was the day I would begin the journey to furfill my destiny. I had spent many of my hatchling years under the tutilage of the Mystics of Cabalis, they taught me all living things have a spirit, and while it was easy to convince a living being to be a tool for our regal line, the art of asking the dead spirits of animals to give to us their blessing is quite different.  I am the oldest of 4 Siblings, and I am a shaman. My brother Shasthis spent too much time playing with the Scaled Wolves, and has since become a Beastlord. Next in the Line is my Sister, who unfortunately has been pampered by the nobles of Cabalis, for she went down the respected path of Necromancer. My Brother Shaszaak has a burning in his blood to that he has forged to perfection, learning the skills of our battle hardened monks.  Since I was the eldest, I made my rite of passage first, and began my spirit walk with the first steps into the Field of Bone, a place filled with the remains of the fallen warriors of both sides of the Iksar vs Dragon battle. I spent the first few seasons of my life honing my skills against the skeletons and the Scaled Pups, and as I worked to increase my skill, I saw the powerful Deltree, an elder beastlord, hated by most Iksar for his befriending the "softskins" as we call all other races. Upon meeting him, he told me his story, and inspired me to join him in the Call of Honour, a guild of like minded warriors seeking to rid Norrath of the greater threats against us.  One I had accepted his call, I returned to my practice, and eventually getting very tired of killing the unyielding number of skeletons, I made my way to the Plane of Knowledge for the first time.  The Plane of Knowledge is hard to describe, picture a giant floating library, with stores and banks all around it, as adventurers pass through seeking to fuel their knowledge of magic, or to barter their magics with others. Many even gave young adventurer's free enhancements for battle. I was impressed by the charity of many in this place. But I also heard this place was a crossroads to connect me to any location I needed to go quicker than any boat could promise. So I touched the Kelethin Stone, it felt as if a lightning bolt hit me, and then I was standing just outside the tree city.  It was here I met a powerful barbarian named Finaid, I gave him my assistance for I felt with two strong sets of hands we could destroy the orcs, and possibly gain me enough favor to one day enter the city of Kelethin, if anything out of convienance, not out of compassion. Finaid was mighty indeed and we slayed many Orc's for countless seasons together.  Eventually I had heard that my brother had finally left the nest as well, and that Shasthis was working toward earning the respect of his warder. I found him hunting the same forest city that I had when I first got out of the nest. When I got there, I found that he had grown through many seasons without my knowing it, and so I allied with my brother as we as a duo killed many more orc than we could have alone. We entered the corrupted city of Crushbone, and we began to slay the Orcish slavers, my brother gained many more seasons under my watchful eye.   Later that evening I had heard word that my Sister had just been granter her leave from the necromancer's tower, and that she could now practice her arts on the world at large, and not just in chantries within the walls of Cabalis. We met her at the Knowledge book inside Greater Faydark, and we watched over her first few seasons. She has been tutored more in the ways of the noble iksar necromancers, and because of this has an intense hatred for living softskins than me and Shasthis.  After a few close calls, my sister decided to make camp, so we went to the Plane of knowledge, and made camp, while my brother Shasthis said he needed to finish a few things, probably testing his skills with his new warder he had earned that day. I bid him farewell, and made camp.  The next day we awoke we discovered that my other brother Shaszaak had left the nest and began to hone his fighting techniques in the ways of the monk. Shaclas our sister and Shaszaak joined forces against the vile orcs while Shasthis and I joined forces to keep watch over our brethren. I almost neglected to mention that I had met once again the mighty Kretais, a mystic elder shaman. I knelt in reverence to him, for any one strong enough to wield that much power deserved to be shown respect, even if they are a softskin. My sister and brother shaszaak didn't believe this so, and my sister told me that Shamans are soft, and challenged my life. I told her that she should not challenge the power of a shaman at her age, but her naivity won out over my wisdom.   I accepted her challenge, and promptly slowed her and blinded her, she managed to hit me with her diseases, but they had no effect on my health. I kept her blinded and repeatedly struck her in the back of the head, as I saw her swaying about to topple over, I held fast, and informed her that if she wished to stay conscious, she would yield and call off her annoying skeleton ally, I also wanted to make sure she was still strong with the enhancements the mighty kretais had laid upon us. She did yield, and we all received the blessing of temperence from Halzor, a dwarven ally from the Call of Honour. I exchanged h
