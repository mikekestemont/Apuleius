wednesday....just finished yet another night of wine and happas....today was south africa....nothing exciting....food was greasy.....wine was good....clientele the same as always....pretentious and wealthy with a sense of entitlement that i am beginning to have less and less tolerance for....speedy gonzales (my nickname for the little columbian chef that's sweet on me) continues to woe me with extra vegetables on staff meals and "oohs" and "aahs" when i enter the kitchen with dirty coffee cups.....i don't understand what's so appealing about dirty dishes....juan, one of the guys i serve with, witnessed speedy's efforts by spying through the window and he seems to find it equally as creepy as i do....i try to not look at him (easy as he is at least a foot shorter than i am), make sure i don't come within a whole metre of his person, and say i am busy anytime he calls my name.....but after a month of giving him the cold shoulder, he perseveres.....maybe i should try this uber-bitch method on boys i really like....maybe there is some truth in the whole playing-hard-to-get thing....either way, it is progressively getting more and more creepy and i think i need to either have a good face-to-face with little speedy or have management talk to him...it's riding my nerves....  my boss also said that i induce a sense of guilt in him when i look at him....like i am accusing him of something....like he's done something wrong.....i couldn't possibly tell you what he's done wrong...i don't really care for that matter but it is an interesting comment....he's not the first to comment on my way of looking.....my old boss found it seductive and this new one finds it guilt-inducing.....some say it's just intense....what can i say?.....i just look....directly....maybe that freaks people out....  for the rest, i haven't much to say....my days consist of beach and work....my nights of sleep and disturbing dreams...i wake up more tired that before i sleep....but for the rest, i'm ok....i eat well....i rest (i think)....i've lost 4 kilos....and the family is alright....they don't drive me crazy....the maid cleans my room....my mother makes me breakfast and lunch....how will i ever survive back in holland with no maid and no mother?.....haha....i'm sure i'll be fine....at this point, i still see it as a luxury....the minute i see it as normal, i'm likely a lost cause.....  so here i am, at one o'clock in the morning, behind this screen....cognac....and no desire to sleep.....missing all of you who read this blog....  dames, bedankt voor je berichten....jammer dat ik niks terug kan sturen....hoop dat alles goed is in maastricht zonder mij.....juud, laat me ff weten als je&nbsp;mijn sleutel al hebt....moet namelijk iemand hebben die me post uit de bus kan halen en mijn inschrijving voor de uni opsturen....mina, hoe ging het bij vodafone???....heb je nu werk?....smelly, hoe was barcelona?....  R, dank je voor je berechten...je zorgt dat ik me altijd populaire voelt.....hoeft niet maar als je iets wilt sturen, woon ik op cas coraweg 41, willemstad, curaçao, NA....  superstar, was leuk om met je chatten.....1...2...3....4....ja....uhunh....maar ff iets anders....persevere!.....het gaat je allemaal lukken....een veel plezier met je tractors en koeien (sp?)....mis je....  &nbsp;
diane ackerman, in her book&nbsp; the natural history of love , claims that 74% of married american men cheat....i wonder if european men cheat more than americans or less?.....and what about antilleans?.....i'm not sure if culture and socialization influence the percentage of cheaters but i am sure that socialization and culture do influence the expression and form of cheating....cheating is a broad term.....it could be anything from&nbsp;one night stand to a short fling to a long-term mistress....what has surpised me here in curaçao is the openness with which it happens...i often serve a regular and his wife on an evening that entails only an entree and house wine....and three days later, the same regular is back in doing the app, entree, dessert thing with expensive wine but the woman with him is not the wife.....she is usually young and spanish speaking here.....maybe gold-digging....maybe not....another guy came in alone and waited for his girlfriend...they chatted, drank, cuddled, kissed for an hour and then she left....ten minutes later, his wife came in....they chatted, drank, cuddled, kissed for an hour and left together....i'm not really surprised by this all.....but what surprises me is the openness.....do these guy know others won't tell their wives or do they not care if their wives know?...that's my thought for today....
every wednesday passeniers does a wine and happas menu...they pick a country and then build the wine menu and apps accordingly....last night was spain....and they turned it into a a big tapas buffet.....tortilla, abigodias, oyster pasties, huevos atun.....good food.....but it was crazy crazy busy....normally we close up at around 2330 but last night t
