So Josh went to visit his parents this weekend...  having him GONE for a little over 24 hours was AWFUL.  I didn't sleep, I did nothing but eat, I got sick as a dog I even developed a very year urinary tract infection....  because I was stressed out that he was gone....  He comes back, and tells me that he has an opportunity to work less hours, and make just as much money.   He wants me to move to Mesa with him.  He even went so far as to tell me that when we have been together long enough, eventually I will become his wife.    I want this move.  I want a fresh life in a fresh town, a fresh start.  But I am terrified to leave my current job.  My boss counts on me, and I adore him.  He's like family.  I don't want to go.  I know leaving this job is burning a bridge behind me...  I'll never be able to come back to work here.    I am writing up my resume, and getting ready to start looking for work in Mesa/Tempe/ Phoenix area.  Damn this is scary.  I've been sheltered my whole life.  I'm putting everything on the line for Josh... and I dont even have the commitment I said I would require.
Well, Saturday I woke up at 7am, and I sat and watched cartoons with the kids.  Josh woke up around 11am, and we spent the day being lazy... it was nice. I needed it.  Then Saturday evevening we went out driving in the rain.  Josh wants a tattoo, so we stopped by Old Towne tattoo to look at the flash.  Josh found a tat he likes, but it's $200.00 a pop.. and he wants one on each arm.  So we're looking at $400.00, so Josh can look like abig tough biker with tattoos on his arms.  To be honest, I love the fact that he isn't all tattooed up, I can show him off without having to explain...  but they are his arms, his skin...  his tattoos...  I'll back him no matter how much I dont like it. We stopped and got some movies..  Lord of the Flies, because I had never seen it and Josh felt it was an icon of our generation, The Tommyknockers because I have to have my horror flick, and Jackass the movie... because Josh thinks that stuidity is funny. (It's not)  We got home at like 11pm, and stayed up and watched Jackass, whichis alot funnier after a couple shots of Don Julio tequila (The best Tequila in the world) and a benedryl, then we tried to stay up and watch The TommyKnockesrs...  but I was just too out of it... I HAD to go to bed.  Sunday morning, 7am...  my son, Alan starts crying.  I go into his room just in time to watch him throw up all over his bed.  I get him up, bathe him, clean up his bed, throw out his pillow (it was already in bad shape), and get him and his sister sat down watching cartoons.  I try to stay up with them.. but end up falling back asleep.  Josh got up, took care fo the kids, and made breakfast. (What a GREAT man).  I wake up at like 11am, and we lounge around until Debi (My ex-husband's mom) came to pick up Ravyn (my daughter) for the weekend.  Once Ravyn was gone, we got dressed and hopped in the car and went to Tanque Verde Falls....  which was a stagnant, disgusting puddle instead of the beautiful falls we were expecting after all our recent rain.  we hiked around for a while, and it was beautiful despite the lack of water.  But my legs felt like they were on fire!  I dont know if I have a minor tanning salon burn, and that the sun was making it worse, or if it is a symptom of the Psoriasis...  but I was miserable.   I wanted to go home and slather a ton of lotion on my legs, but Josh was already upset with me for being unhappy that there was no water.. so I toughed it out.  Ended up haing a lot of fun despite myself. I adore Josh.  He gave up everything to come to Tucson to be with me.   That said... I fear that we may be torn apart.  Josh just wants to go home to Mesa, Az....  I am set up to be self sufficient here in Tucson, AZ.  If I give up my job and my apartment and I move to Mesa, I will never find work for what I make here ...  I'm an uneducated highschool drop out.  I'm LUCKY to make 430.00 a week before taxes.  ...  I'm scared to pick up and move and lose my security...  for a boyfriend.  It would be different for a husband...  but Josh wont commit to me that way.  I know he loves me, he takes excellent care of me.  But I don't want to move to Mesa, and then have him just walk out on me.  I want to know that if I move to Mesa, he's not going anywhere.   Well, boss just stuck his head in my office, I need to work on billing today.  UGH!
