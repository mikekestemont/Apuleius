I started a blog on society and "progress", but that will have to wait a few days. Instead, it's going to be a quiet blog today... all about nothing. Sad, isn't it?    &nbsp;  But then again, today was a pretty productive day, I must admit. I probably should do more of this. It's sad... the day that I'm the most productive is also the day that I stay the latest.    &nbsp;  It's a beautiful 29 degrees outside, and I can't wait to enjoy the rest of the afternoon.    &nbsp;  Sorry :)
I read somewhere that people are now trying to design offices so that people would walk more... such as putting meeting rooms and cafeterias on opposite ends of buildings to encourage people to walk to those places. All of this is an attempt to make people more active. I'm not really sure how active walking a few hundred feet (at most) would make people more fit.     The article also talks about encouraging gym memberships and putting gyms inside the office buildings. Would this really work? On one hand, having a gym nearby may entice people to go and join it. On the other hand, there's nothing sillier than seeing a person run in place for an hour. No... not true. What is sillier is to see a roomful of people running in place for an hour.    Why do companies do this? Do you think it is because they care about their employees' well-being? Hardly. More fit employees are more productive employees. More productive employees mean (hopefully) more profits for the company. All this just makes personal time really rare.    Because of this, I have a proposal for creating a more active environment. (Of course it can't be serious... but maybe, just maybe, we should give it a try! At least the first point... it actually seems feasible. At least according to me.)      Force people not to drive to work   This&nbsp;would reduce air pollution, therefore making our respiratory systems healthier to begin with. This would also keep people healthy because they would do a lot more walking than just a paltry walk to the faraway bathroom/cafeteria/meeting room.   We could implement this by banning cars altogether. That would make the auto industry mad, but who needs them anyway? Those that had jobs there could do something else, maybe design and manufacture better and more efficient buses/trains/bikes, etc. because we would need a better transit system now that nobody has cars. I'm open to suggestions.      Cut off electricity to the office building   If people want to use their computer, they could just sit on a stationary bike that generates electricity when you use it. Think of the Tour de France trainee in "The Triplets of Belleville". He powers his mother's gramophone (?) by cycling. We just need to design better stationary bikes. Hey, maybe those in the auto industry could get started on this!&nbsp;You don't even need heat then, because people would generate so much heat by making the whole building into one large fitness facility. This way, you can get fit while working! Companies don't have to give their employees fitness benefits anymore, people have more personal time because they don't need to go to the gym anymore, and companies save money because they don't need electricity or heat anymore! Then we would not get blackouts either because there's enough electricity to go around. How great would that be?     Or perhaps we should all just go back to the pre-Industrial Revolution&nbsp;where life was a lot more active, and work didn't mean sitting on your butt doing the same thing over and over again. Cynical? Probably. We would lose a lot of the productivity that we have now, but who said that now was better? Is progress as we know it really a good thing? I'll probably ramble on that point sometime later...
Today marks the second day in a row that I've gotten up before seven in the morning. All right... before eight in the morning. 6:20, to be precise,&nbsp;right before&nbsp;my mother called, probably to make sure I hadn't died in the night.     &nbsp;   Having breakfast while watching the morning news is not something I have done before.     &nbsp;   Getting to work before eight is strange too, because this building is absolutely deserted, save for a girl putting up signs for a conference and the dining services truck stopping to drop off today's supply of croissants and other breakfast goodies.     &nbsp;   Here are some benefits:       I can surf in peace and take care of all personal things without people constantly looking in the window to see whether I am working or not.    I can take long lunch breaks  and  still manage to leave at a reasonable time.    It is quiet so I can also work in peace. Well, it's quiet most of the day, but there is nobody here to bother you in the mornings with email and other such nonsense as well.    It's a nice and cool drive to work. The sun hasn't quite come up completely yet, so the air's got that crisp feeling that's associated with early mornings (and getting lots done, in my opinion).    There is nothing to do in the evenings, so I might as well go to sleep. And what am I going to do with all that sleep?     I am not advocating that everyone should get up early. It does cut into late-night fun. Except I don't get that aspect of life at the moment... so I can go to bed early, and&nbsp;therefore get up early. However, I am not usually a morning person. My university sleeping schedule varied, but (barring early morning classes... sometimes) it usually ranged from bedtime at one or two in the morning and getting up at ten or eleven in the morning. Move everything one or two hours later once in a while. But if I do this with work, I won't arrive until noon-ish, and can't leave until everyone else has been long gone.    So this morning, what have I done? Well, after forty-five minutes, I got a drink, read t
