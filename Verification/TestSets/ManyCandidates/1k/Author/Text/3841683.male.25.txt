Hey there.   This evening I went to a Welcome Orientation for the RNC '04 in NYC.  I'm from across the hudson so I went to the event in Hackensack NJ at the BCRO on Main St.   The turnout seemed kind of small, but it was one of the earlier of the seminars scheduled for the day. My only real problem with it was the presentation was only 15 minutes long and they told us nothing.  Basically all they told us was to show up with the same IDs we came with for training and that the website will be updated later in the month, so go home and we'll see you soon. I for one hoped they would have discussed what we as volunteers would be doing other than working 6-8 hour shifts doing something "volunteer-like".     I created this Blog for everyone who's volunteered their time for either the re-election of our President, George W. Bush, or for the Republican National Convention.  I'm not affiliated with either organization, and this blog is not affiliated with their respective websites.  I'll post any relevant news about the RNC that I come aware of between now and the convention.  -
Two years ago on this day I found out that my father was dead.&nbsp; I wasn't overly surprised by this news.&nbsp; He had had a few heart attacks in his day, so I assumed that was the cause.&nbsp; I was not particularly close to the man, so I wasn't all that upset.&nbsp; You see, my parents had been separated since shortly before my birth, and the divorce was finalized a year or two later.&nbsp; My mom had sole custody of me, he did of course have visitation rights which he seldom used.&nbsp; I can distinctly remember the half dozen or so times that I actually spent time with him.&nbsp;  My first impression of him was back in 82, or 83, I can never be sure since I was so young at the time.&nbsp; He came by to visit and he brought me a gift, a toy.&nbsp; As you well know, all small boys and most girls love toys and presents of all sorts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, dear old dad got me a doll.&nbsp; A Ken Doll with some weird shaving accessory (put his head under cold water and he has a five o'clock shadow, use the shaving accessories along with warm water to shave him).&nbsp; My initial reaction was "Gee thanks Dad..."&nbsp; or something to the effect.&nbsp; I was a rather intuitive child, so I made him feel better about himself by bringing a crappy toy.&nbsp; For chrissakes, I'm a boy!&nbsp; I don't play with Ken &amp; Barbie!!&nbsp;&nbsp; Enough about that sore episode.&nbsp; We'll flash-forward a few years and skip a visit or two, and go straight to the last few. In the summer of 1986 I spent several weeks down in Toms River with my aunt Sheila.&nbsp; She was my favorite aunt growing up as a child, and I would spend a few weeks with her every summer till I was around 10 or so.&nbsp; This particular summer I remember clearly.&nbsp; Aunt Sheila and I were going on a "special" trip.&nbsp; None of the other kiddies who were ever-present at the house were going on this trip.&nbsp; We told everyone we were going to Seaside, for a nice little jaunt on the boardwalk.&nbsp; To me, Sheila told me we were going to see my dad, and no-one really knows that he's in prison right now, except for her and a few others. You see, the reason for my parents breakup was that my dad was an alcoholic, and a very good one at that.&nbsp; The reason his whereabouts were a secret was that he was in jail.&nbsp; Apparently Dear Old Dad was on a bender, ran out of cash, and decided to hold up a liquor store.&nbsp; The only problem with his plan was a) he had a fake gun, b) he tried to rob a liquor store that he frequented regularly, and c) he wore no disguise.&nbsp;&nbsp; Definitly not a smart idea, but he went through with it anyway and wound up in the clink.&nbsp;  So here I am, seven years old, and about to enter a prison for the very first time to visit my incarcerated father.&nbsp; Can't you just see the mental scars forming?&nbsp; I don't remember much detail other than white linoleum flooring, beige painted prison bars, and lots of scary sounds.&nbsp; Dad promised to keep in touch with me, and write me letters regularly.&nbsp; I was apithetic, bored, and scared.&nbsp; I couldn't wait to get home.&nbsp;  That night I spoke to my mom about it, she asked me how I felt, I didn't know.&nbsp; I still don't know.&nbsp; It's an odd thing to come to terms with.&nbsp;&nbsp; Following the visit, i patiently awaited the promised letters from Dad.&nbsp; They never came.&nbsp; I was a bit disappointed.&nbsp; Not too much, for I learned at an early age, expect nothing from him.&nbsp;&nbsp; After a year or two, I mentioned the letters to my mom, and she let me know that he did in fact write me letters, but she did not want me to be exposed to a father in jail and have a constant reminder of it with the letters a-flowing.&nbsp; She wrote him and asked him to stop the letter writing, he complied.&nbsp; It wasn't until I was fourteen that I saw him again.&nbsp; This time at my uncle Kevin's funeral.&nbsp; He too was an alcoholic (alcoholism seems to be the family trade) and died of cirrosis of the liver.&nbsp; At the funeral Dad showed up once again, we spoke breifly.&nbsp; I noted how short the man seemed, he couldn't be an inch over 4'10" and I was already through puberty, so I had at least six inches on him.&nbsp; Once again did he say he'd stay in touch, he told me that I should come down to visit him.&nbsp; I said sure, why not?&nbsp; Though at the time I was in the midst of the hellish years of high s
