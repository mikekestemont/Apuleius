Eu decidi começar um blog em portuguêse por que tenho muitos amigos brasileiros e nem todos falam inglês. Que coisa, né?  Vou deixar notícias, fotos, mensagens, etc. aqui diariomente (espero).  Um abraço.

I'm still working on my worst songs list. I had no idea it would take this long, but it is. Hopefully I should have it up by this weekend.  Anyway, work is pretty busy. School is also busy. Oddly enough, I'm not.   Word.
I took a short break yesterday. I'm still working on my 50 Worst Songs Ever list.   About  urlLink Jump 's new album,  Between the Dim & the Dark : it's pretty good. I'm a little disappointed that it's not the best album as I've ever heard, but it's still good. "Mexico," "Between the Dim & the Dark," "Young America" & "Daylight" are amazing songs. Get them from  urlLink iTunes  if you can. It's not that the rest of the songs suck. They're just average. I'm sure they'll grow on me.  I also recommend downloading the demo version of " urlLink Daylight " (Don't worry, this one's free). The difference between the demo and the final product are startling. You will be amazed.  Word.
I had one heck of a weekend-- not really. I didn't do anything really.   Thankfully, don't have class today, which is cool. I'm not sure what I'm going to do today other than work. I'm at work right now. We're still listening to the 70's station on our satellite radio. I hate "Stayin' Alive." I've heard it so much that I think I've got it memorized by now.   Speaking of crappy music,  urlLink Blender  just released their  urlLink list  of the  urlLink 50 Worst Songs Ever . I'm all for informing the public of what songs not to listen to, but this is the worst list ever of crappy songs. I agree with them on some of their choices (i.e. "My Heart Will Go On"), but The Beatles' "Ob-La-Di-Ob-La-Da"? Simon & Garfunkel's "Sounds of Silence"? These songs are classics! How did these songs make the list? It doesn't make sense to me. I'm sure we can all think of at least 10 really crappy songs that did not make the list ("Mmmbop," "The Macarena," "The Sign"...), but should have. I would like to think that I have better musical tastes than these guys. I would never trust anyone at Blender to make me a mixtape. I'll post my own list of the 50 Worst Songs Ever later this week.   About some good music: I just "purchased" (I got it from  urlLink iTunes  using my free song credits, courtesy of  urlLink Pepsi )  urlLink Jump's  (formerly known as Jump Little Children) new album  Between the Dim & the Dark  Saturday. I haven't been able to make it through the whole album yet, but what songs I have heard are amazing. The band's lead singer,  urlLink Jay Clifford , has an awesomely unique voice (for an amazing display of Jay's talent, check out "Cathedral" from their "debut,"  Magazine ). Jump is fast becoming one of my favorite bands. I'll post a full review of the album later.  Word.
I am bored at work. This is usual for me. If I wasn't bored at work I'd be bored at home or at school. I figured I'd start a blog to help keep myself occupied and also to help me ignore the country music satellite station playing here at work. I am not a country fan.   There is always music playing on the overhead speakers here at work. It's supposed to help our morale as we deal with irrate customers here at our customer service center. I can tell you that it doesn't work very well. It's not that I hate music. I love music. I just don't love the music I'm forced to listen to on a daily basis.   Usually (four and a half days out of five), we'll listen to either the 80's station or the 70's station. The same songs are played all day every day. Finally, after nearly a week, someone will change the station to a decent one with a good mix of music. You'd think that would satisfy everyone. Unfortunately, you can't please all the people all the time. Inevitably, someone (who hates modern music) will switch the station to the country station. On Monday, the cycle will start all over again. To quote the great philosopher Garfield, "I hate Mondays."  ____________________________________________________________   On another note: In a turn of wicked events, I finally watched  urlLink Kill Bill  Volumes 1 & 2. I probably shouldn't have watched them, but I did. I liked the music from the movies so much that I bought soundtrack. Amazing! I think those who were surprised to see Quentin Tarantino on  urlLink American Idol  the other week should take a listen. This man knows his music!   Speaking of  urlLink American Idol , people are really worked up over America's  urlLink decision  to vote off Jennifer Hudson. I think I was as shocked as the rest of the country. I was even more shocked that the three best performers were in the bottom three. I will tell you now that if either John Stevens, Diana DeGarmo or Jasmine Trias wins, their record sales will equal those of  urlLink Justin Guarini  (FYI: Record sales were dismal and his record label gave him the boot. He found out he was dropped while reading a magazine article. Sad). Maybe I should start voting-- or not. I don't really care all that much. The show is entertaining, but not entertaining enough for me to actually by any of their records.   Word.   UPDATE: The satellite radio station has changed. We're now listening to the 70's station. This place is too predictable.
I get a three day weekend this weekend. I don't have to work Monday because of Memorial Day.  It is confirmed:  The Day After Tomorrow  is   urlLink "a wreck" . For once,  urlLink CNN  and  urlLink Fox News  agree on something. I'm not sure if I want to w
