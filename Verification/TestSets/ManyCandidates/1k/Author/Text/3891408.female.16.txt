Lately i have been having the time of my life...but yesterday def. wasnt one of those days. Like everything was going wrong...and now some people hate me for it.&nbsp; I wish things werent like this but they are and you just have to find a way of dealing with it or you will be misserable. So yesterday we were suppose to have another craZy asS nite....but we found out it was cancelled at the last minute...literally as we are getting in the car to leave. The we went to KJs bc we had no where else to go.Then we were gunna go to Michelles for a bondfire n everything...but as soon as Biney,Ben and Mike got there...we left for Codys. Well that was a bust so we just ended up hangin out at fast food places and driving around. Michelles was fun though..we havent done that in a long time girls...i miss all of us hanging out all the time.&nbsp; But as the night went on things got worse..and now i feel like&nbsp;shit...as a person. I hurt some people in the process of having fun...even though it really shouldnt make that much difference to me anymore...somehow it still does. &nbsp;And i know it may seem like im ok and i dont really care i do...but sometimes it just hurts too much to just sit down and think about it. Because the more i think about it...the worse i feel and then i start to regret doing what i did. But i know in the long run i did what was right...and i will be ok...and so will they. I just wish life wasnt so complicated all the time. Like i wish you could do whatever you wanted and no one would ever get hurt or anything. But in reality no matter what you do...whether it hurts you or not..you may be hurting someone else in the process. Sometimes i wish i could see what life would be like without me...like what my friends and everyone would be like. Would they all still be friends...would they be as close. You dont know the impact youve made on other people...and i wish we could see what life would be like without me..just to know...and to see if i really did make a difference in someones life. Idk anymore...i just wish life made sense again.&nbsp;
WOW last nite was sooo much fun!!! I love my girls and guys soo much!! (Melissa*Linz*Kath*Biney*Ben*Cody*Andy) I was soo gone!lol You know I'm here for the party*And I ain't leaving till they throw me out*Gonna have a little fun gonna get me some*You know I'm here,I'm here for the party*  That is soo our song ladies!!! lol  "let me talk to that bitch!!" LmaO "Cody wants to get on you!!" LmaO Linz...you know i love you w all my heart!! "Dude lets have an orgy!!" haha Melissa...wow that is def. a nite ill never forget.  Ive been thinking alot..now that im single!! lol  And ive realized I dont remember the last time i have been this happy and free. Like i dont have to worry about hurting anyone by doing something stupid..and i can do what i want when i want. There is just so much drama with relationships and i just want to have a good time. I dont want to worry about any of this stuff..i mean im only 16...its not like im gunna marry the person i date in high school. Like you always hear about those people that marry their high school sweathearts..but they way i think of it is..you never know whats out there unless you look. Like the person of you dreams could be you best guy friend and youll never know the possibilitys. Im so just so happy i have the best friends in the whole world and they are always there for me. I really dont know what i would do without them. And we dont even fight..which is awesome bc im so sick of the drama and fighting...but with us we just want to have a good time and we dont really care what we look like or what we are doing. I know ive found people that have def. influenced my life forever and i am a better person for them. --im out--<3 you all
Wow today was such a fun day...well most of it. I didnt get up until alost 11 then i had badminton camp from 2-5 ((which was hell if i might add))  its badminton..come on...were not at military school! lol  Then tonite i went out with Brit(who i havent hung out w in soo long) Linz n Kathy!! We saw sleepover..w then hott guy...lol  Do you like brownie!! ahahaha funny stuff. Then we went to Olive Garden and scared our waiter! "Why is that kid sitting at the bar??" lmao...thats a grown woman!! hahahahha  nice Kathy! After Olive Garden we went n visited KJ @ good ole baskin robins..and thats about it. Slow motion..ahh good song.  Im having a blah day and i havent really had time to think about anything in particular. Yesterday i had a <3 to <3 w my fav girl in the whole world Melissa...n she got me thinking...as usual! lol  Do i live my life to the fullest? I wish i could be one of those people who did what they wanted when they wanted and they had no regrets..everything does happen for a reason and whats ment to be will. But sometimes thats so hard..like not to really care about other people and to just worry about yourself...but in a way thats kinda of being selfish...but in the end you have to look out for whats best for you. Because you cant always count on other people...but you can count on youself. anyways...its still on for wed. should b a blast!! well im out XoX
