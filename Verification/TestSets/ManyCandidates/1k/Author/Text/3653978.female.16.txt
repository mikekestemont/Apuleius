Dear Diary!!             Soo.....happy....         &nbsp;    I saw him!!!! He s absolutely fab!!! Hee
This is the second week of sch....  Stress manz....there's soo much to do ... n there nvr seem to b enough time n energy to do them....i end up delaying them when i intended to complete them....haiz...  Then, haiz....  In my previous blog entry, i wrote about wat happened on sat right?? .... Well, i caught up with Adam yesterday...he told me that my manager was puzzled about my absence on Sun...n that he wanted to talk with the assisstant manager abt it...is that gd or bad?? Well,i dun care so much abt it...so...heck care!!  And also i heard from Adam that the two old witches had been called into the office to have a meeting with the manager n Ms R...it seems one of the old witches,the younger one came out in tears...or rather she looked as though shes abt to cry...haha, they got feelings meh?? if they do...its a miracle!! lolzzz....  Now, this is wat s been on my mind these few days...:  now, ppl....ive to apologise...it might seem irritating to some that i seem to write nothing but abt HIM...Theres no one i can really talk to...no one seems to truly understand....this the only place i can write my thoughts etc...n perhaps...think of ways to make my life easier...  I havent seen him ever since the 7th...although i just chatted with him on the 9th...  Although i chatted with him, it still doesnt beat seeing him in person...n talking face - to - face...I miss him....i cant get used it...i mean not seeing him everyday...n hearing his voice....etc...  n I messaged him a few times during past few days...but i got no response from him...Haiz... NO IDEA WATs GOING ON....I really wish i knew...  Then....remember i wrote abt Ms R liking the guy i like??  Now heres wat has been happening in a nutshell...:   She liked this guy 10 yrs older than her... Shes 22 i think...N whenever theres anything shes upset abt or happy abt with regards to the guy she has a crush on... I was always there...Hey, this guy doesnt know abt her crush on him...now changing target to the guy i like...  To me, i would nvr joke abt snatching someone away from my fren...I would nvr dream of even saying that...and needless to say flirt with the guys my frens like...  In short....she intends to snatch him away from me...
Haiz....  I didnt turn up for work today....there are a few reasons for me doing so...  1) I havent completed my homework...n reading up of my lectures...  2) My Mum dont think i can cope with everything- meaning; my sch work n working life...n wanted me to rest well b4 the coming week....(first week of sch was kind of tiring for me)   3) The duty supervisor... (i d rather not mention her name...lets call her R)...She s a useless supervisor i must say...As u all know...ive been bullied v badly by two old witches, she has nvr told them off or anything neither has she showed any signs of standing by me...she knows very well whos in the wrong n whos in the right...n all she does is to try to please them...What the heck manz...!!   Just the other time...last week rather...last Saturday to b exact...One of the old witches...the older one kept picking on me...i tried v hard to control my anger ...Ive nvr showed my temper till that day...I really wanted to blast her off...but wat held me back was that I didnt want my fren...the supervisor to b in a spot,n i witheld my "blow up".... My fren didnt try to calm me down watsoever...instead she kept showing the "caught in the middle " kind of look...it really made me angry...n not just that, when the old witches told her rubbish abt me...she didnt defend me...n she even agreed to please them... Wat happened was that for the first time in my working there...I slammed things ...cos i couldnt scold them, neither could i "throw" things in their face to shut them up...guess thats the only way i could have retaliated back...The old foxy hag of a witch tried to come as close as possible to accuse me of hurting her when i slammed things, that was wat happened to my fren...haha, i wasnt so silly manz...when i slammed things, and she came near i siamed straight away...  I thought if this kind of lem bei supervisor dont do anything , then wats the point of me working there....Even i tried v hard to control my temper...she still gave me that kind of look n try so hard to please them... Wat if i blew up?....wouldnt the situation b worse?? N perhaps,who knows i might lose a fren in the process....  I really wonder y nobody said anything or told these witches off!! No one can stand them...heard they quarreled a few times with other collegues...  So...the whole day, i tried studying...but couldnt study much as i didnt understand much of the lectures...  Then, my collegue cum fren Yin Xin called me...n asked i
