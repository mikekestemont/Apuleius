So many things I could talk about today. Didn't get to talk to my Daddy, left him a message though. Spent the day with minime asking where her Dad was and why he was taking so long to see her. But made her smile and feel special no matter what. Talked to a few people today, old friends, new friends, special people.  I am sooooooo proud of my friend Sean for his marathon run today!! YAY!!!! I better get my butt in gear and get back in shape or I will never keep up hahaha.  So I was thinking (yeah yeah today I actually DID think) the whole concept of good karma and reaping what you sow. If energy can never be destroyed..maybe the actual energy generated while you are doing something for others is released somehow into the ether and one day will cause a positive reaction in someone else that eventually gets back to you. Likewise the bad energy too...meh...never know huh? Was an interesting thought though. I think I will eat something really bad for me now so I can have freaky dreams and write another interesting blog in the morning... MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAA!!!  Cheers!
when I was hanging out with Dino. We were talking about the higher quality of Greek leather...well he was I was pretending I thought he was right. He was going on about how they make good belts. ( I think he had been awake for something like 49 hours at this point meeting a work deadline ) I was thinking "Yannow...I have heard about a lot of things from Greece don't think belts were in that list" Sometimes I think...nahhhhhh I NEVER think...muahahahahahaaa. Holy molaaaaay I need more coffee or a brain or a Greek Belt?  Cheers

Ugh finally the only show worth watching on TV has come along. The WB's Superstar USA, ooooh man I LOVE that show. An underhanded and mean reality show that takes AWFUL singers who think they are good and lets them howl on international TV. The cast members they chose were perfect Tone-Loc, Vitamin C and a guy named Briggs. Their acting ability to sit there and pretend to be loving people singing like cats in a blender in indeed impressive. So they take them to Hollywood give them makeovers and let them sing..badly. The final 4 were well chosen Jo-Jo who told people it was his "gah-dunk-a-dunk" that made him star material. (that means his butt for those not in the know **wink**) Mario who must weigh all of 90 pounds soaking wet and looks like the kids who used to get shoved in lockers in high school. Jaime the obligatory blonde bimbo with more cup size than cranium size. Rosa the latina firecracker who lives in her own lil world and was probably the worst singer there. I do have to admire all the entertainers confidence in themselves albeit a lil misguided. I missed the last show because someone special was getting her swimming badge and have tried to find more info on how the show went down. A few comments here and there online only to find that JAIME WON!!! UGHHHH!!! NOOOOOOO!!!! For gawd sakes do we NOT have enough female pop-TARTS out there these days?? Yes her looks will sell her to the male audiences even if she can't sing. I think we needed someone like Mario to give all those male singers a run for their pec and chin implants. Rosa well....yeah the worst singer but she didn't have the spark and she can't shake it like J-Lo and Aguilera. Jo-Jo was just too sweet I think, or too simple....I dunno one or the other. Apparently it works for a woman but not for a man. Yay Jaime you have just become a part of the machine that is stardom,but for the love of all that is sacred someone give her cue cards so she can stop writing lyrics on her hands!!!  Cheers!
We always hear statistics stating we are an aging nation, but how does that really affect us? All the advances in health care and medicine have people who might not have otherwise survived living till their 80's and 90's. A couple thousand years ago 30 really was middle age and 60 was as old as 90 is today. Always searching for the youth, the secret of eternal life....dealing with a whole other area of medicine that will become the focus of all our healthcare dollars even more so..."Geriatrics" I love my lil grandma dearly but it is so hard to watch her age, she was born in 1918 the year Influenza B swept across North America and killed so many. Indeed her own mother became very ill when my grandma was only a few months old. Grandma was sent to stay with Aunt Lizzie till her Ma was better. She managed to stay well through that. She also managed to survive as one of the middle children in a family of 9 kids. In a house with no running water. I think about how my child will never know what it's like to have to live with an outhouse and baths in the kitchen(well those ones in the sink when she was 6 months old were cute hehe). My grandma married a man 12 years her senior whom was the love of her life....brought 4 kids into this world on Dairy Farms. Worked hard..watched her family grow...watched my grandfather grow more and more ill after he retired and take care of him like a nurse after his many strokes. He passed away in 1988 and she has never even considered another man. Then her energy was directed back to her kids and grandkids, and most importantly her garden. That woman has more strength and courage than most of the people I know. And as I watch her health start to fail at the age of almost 86...I find myself dealing with the one of the hard truths of life. We all w
