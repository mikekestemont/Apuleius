it was pretty fun. lemonsoul was dec as always. i had my heart restarted when a tent blew on top of me and about killed me. freakin' scary. most everyone left though except hilary and liz who were high but pretty chill, kinda psycho though. by fire played there, this hardcore band from bellefonte. i liked their music, but not the singer, she was a little freaky. one of the bands where i can't tell what the hell they are saying but it sounds crazy. im pretty sure the lyrics are actually 'love thy neighbor' or 'always share' or something like that.

-this is one of my oldest theories- we have, according to the bible, been wearing clothes since the time of adam and eve when they learned vanity. from that time period until the early 20th century, we have kept the same amount of covering we have had, and even slowly added covering. those who did not wear ample covering were presumed to be prostitutes, tramps, or maniacs. in the early 20th century, we saw a revolutionary change in the basics of fashion. as men left to fight in world wars I and II, the women replaced them in the workplace, and with this new found sense of responsibility came a want or even a necessity to break out of the shell. womens clothing became more and more skimpy until the present day. mens fashion was soon to follow. today, clothes are still even skimpier than the year before. this leads me as well as my colleagues bonsall, griffin and vidmar to conclude that the amount of skin coverage on ones body in relation to time would follow a parabolic curve, time zero being at t=-2000 (bc) give or take, and the graphs minimum at approximately t=1910. by following the graph along, you might see that that there is a Ac(amount of coverage)=0 value at t=5820. we conclude that by the year 5820, we will be totally naked. yeah, thats right, we will just be walkin around in the nude 24/7. dont want that girl you like to see your boner? too bad, because its right there, you cant hide it.
over millions and millions of miles in our universe no other form of life has been found. therefore the most complex natural organ is our human mind. this mind gives me the power to write, motvating, inspiring, even discouraging me.  hey just messin around this was created to voice my theories, thoughts, musings, conversations, whatever which all too often appeared in dans blog. im gonna try to update it every friday night at least. hopefully it will be more successful than that damn diary of mine. yeah and this one has no password so that everyone can read it.
from now on, i'll try to remember to put all songs, pictures, whatever files that i may mention onto my 'shared files' thing on aim so you dont even need to have kazaa or whatever to get them. yeah i know, i am awesome. but now you all have no excue not to listen to mummers dance. so try checking out my shared files and tell me if something should be on there. peace out.
today was pretty uneventful. i had to wake up at an ungodly hour to take my dad to work so i'd have the car. then i drove to vidmar's to pick up my backpack at like 8 am and stood at his door thinking about ringing the bell but i wimped out and just went home haha. then i made 5 different mixes for mt. TOP: soft rock, ska/reggae, hard rock and metal, 'fun' alternative, and of course, weird. on the weird cd is a great song called mummer's dance by loreena mckennet or something like that, you all should download it. i plan to burn the discs this evening. at 12 i had guitar and had the shit scared out of me cuz i was doin like 70 on that new fake corl street extension and this cop car flew by me. anyway after guitar i finally went to dans to pick up my backpack and i figured id just chill there for a few minutes until tom came but tom was later than cicadas in centre county. while waiting vidmar put his new drive-by truckers cd in and it was pretty awesome, like driving southern...well...truckin' music. finally tom came and i took them to hannahs but i had to go home and mow the lawn but on the way home i decided i didn't want to mow the lawn and instead me, my little brother, and shawn went out and bought fireworks and set them off under my sheds to try to harass this big fat groundhog who lives in our lawn. it looks like a pile of crap from a distance until it finally musters the strength to move...yeah thats right, kinda like my fat-ass dog salsa. there you have it, feel free to turn your head into the window of my soul and stare like youre a peeping tom. peace.
