Emerson mills was an old mill that got transformed into apartments, my husband picked the crappiest town up near the state capitol, which is Concord. He had gotten a job working on the prisons computer system, so we moved into this place because it was the cheapest place around, only 525.00 a month, not bad huh? We moved in New Years Eve, with the help of some of my husband's friends. It only took 4 hours, by midnight we were done, and sleeping.  When we moved in I liked the place because of it's high ceilings, and enormous windows, and the feel of it was great. Little did I know the feeling would soon dissipate over time. I have to go so I will finish this blog later.
Our flight was long, and horrible, I was breastfeeding my son the whole time, and he barely ate, so I was wicked engorged. The flight was a total of 8 hours, we had to land in Boston, at Logan airport. Then we had a to get on a bus and have them drive us up to NH. I was so exhausted I just wanted to go to bed. So instead of going right to my in-laws house, we end up going to my husband's grandmother's house, and I end up falling asleep there and so on. Eventually we do end up at my Mother-in-laws, and we crash for the night, or for me a few hours before my son got up.   We stayed at my in-laws for approximately 2 months we got there 2 weeks before Halloween, and left New years Eve. During the stay I did however encounter spirits. My mother-in-law and father-in-law decided to tell me about them. They were two sisters who owned the house and the land. They were still in the house. They remember when they were buying the house and started getting in workers to fix some problems in the house, how some workers refused to go into a certain room, in which we were sleeping. My Father-in-law who worked in NY, had a friend who knew a friend that was psychic, and he met her and told her about the workers, so she asked him to bring in something from the house, and she could give him a reading. So he brought in a door handle. She held onto it, and told him about the sisters, how they liked them, but hated their cats. They liked my Mother-in-law because she didn't want to change much in the house. She said other stuff, but unfortunately I forgot what it was.  There was this one time that my mother-in-law and father-in-law, had to go out and get their furniture for their house, so they left with the cats in thouse. An hour later they came back, and found all of the doors closed and locked, and the only way someone could do that was with a key, that they had on them. So they thought the ghosts were angry with them for some reason, so my mother-in-law started looking for her cats, and couldn't find them, she started panicking. My father-in-law started looking as well, they ended up finding all 4 cats in one of the closets, and the closet door was locked. So, to this day my mother-in-law doesn't like elaving her cats alone for very long.  So after I heard these stories I was a little freaked out, they assured me that the ghosts were no longer there, and I had nothing to be afraid of. Well I had my own little encounter before we moved. It was around Christmas time, I was up at night getting my son his nightly bottle. Whenever I had to go downstairs in that house to warm a bottle up, I made sure I left a trail of lights behind me, so I wouldn't be afraid, and I could find my way back easily. So one night I had left my trail of lights, and was warming his bottle up, no one had gotten up, or I would have heard. I did get a creepy sensation I was being watched, but figured it was just paranoia. When the bottle was done I grabbed my son and the bottle, and started back the way I came everything was fine until I reached the stairs, I noticed the light and all of the other lights were turned off, so I turn on each one to find my way back upstairs and in my room, I had never been so scared in my life. The next morning I told my in-laws and my father-in-law thought maybe they were saying hello. Three weeks after that odd happening we moved into Emerson Mills.
So anyhow, the summer of my senior year I met different people, my friend got a boyfriend his name was Jack, we also met Eddie, whom was ok, but I think he really liked me, he also married, and had a kid, nice guy huh?  So once we started school, Eddie's wife Beth moved to Germany with their daughter, so Yvonne and I started hanging out with her a lot, on weekends, every Friday, and she went bar hopping with us as well, (legal drinking age in Germany is 16, I was 18 going on 19) I also found out that Eddie and Beth were Pagans, they practiced magic and worshipping their gods and goddesses. I found that very interesting, and she got me book on wicca, in which I read but never practiced. So anyhow, one day I was in her apartment, we were smoking, and such, and we got on the subjects of ghosts. Yvonne and I told her about what happened at my apartment and her apartment. Beth then said, "I have a ghost too." I was like yeah right. She said I do it's like to play with my daughter's toys, so I said prove it! She got up and went into her daughter's room and took out her toy box. I was like what are you doing, all s
