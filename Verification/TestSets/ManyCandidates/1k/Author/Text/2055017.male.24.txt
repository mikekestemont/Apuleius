Welcome back.    I apologize for being away from the blogosphere for so long. A lot has happened in the last six months and I could never write it all down in so much as an essay here. I have changed the format of this site somewhat so as to give me a space to write all angles of the human experience. From essays to humor articles to poetry and song, I hope this can be inspirational to anyone who might be in need.
A Ton of Diets, Figuratively Speaking   An Essay   As of this morning, I have lost roughly thirty-five pounds. Being proud of this achievement, I decided to reward myself with a bowl of Frosted Flakes. Two months ago, my wife and I decided to lose weight the Dr. Phil way. Back in September, when Dr. Phil began his weight loss series, he was quick to address that this plan was not a diet, but rather a change of lifestyle. He added, further, that he did not intend to become a part of the overrated, multi-million dollar, overpaid dieting industry. So, naturally, he published a book entitled,  The Ultimate Weight Solution , followed by its companion,  The Ultimate Weight Solution Food Guide , and then endorsed “Shape Up,” a  diet  candy bar. I sure am glad he isn’t trying to capitalize on the overrated, multi-million dollar, overpaid dieting industry.  Losing weight has been a wonderful experience. And most people can say they’ve tried a million diets – and then some. There have, after all, been a ton (no pun intended) of diet plans that have come and gone, then come back, and then leave again. A great example of this was the “Low Fat” diet. Remember this diet?   Nothing on the “Low Fat” diet was off limits, providing you simply chose to eat the “Fat-Free” or “Reduced Fat” version of it, which tasted basically the same, only with three grams of sugar missing. For example, one person on the “Low Fat” diet might see another person on the same diet eating a bowl of ice cream. She would ask the woman eating the ice cream, “Hey, is that double-fudge-chocolate-chip ice cream with brownie chunks?”  The woman eating the ice cream would reply, “Why, yes, but that’s okay. It is, after all, one-third lower in fat!”  The two women would then exchange a hearty laugh, and then both would indulge in double-fudge-chocolate-chip ice cream with brownie chunks.   I gained twenty-two pounds on the “Low Fat” diet.   The “new” popular (and now, completely overrated) diet is the low carbohydrate diet. Everyone is working to cooperate with this diet. Burger King, Sonic, Applebee’s, and TGI Fridays all have “Atkins”-friendly menu items. I lost thirty pounds on the low carb diet…the hard way, too, I might add. I did this diet six years ago. Where were the Sugar-free Hershey bars then, huh?  Six years ago, there were no “Atkins”-friendly menu items or “South Beach Diet”-friendly menu items. If someone were to ask you six years ago, “Hey, want to go to Outback and get some Aussie cheese fries?” you would have known that there was no chance of this meaning that there were actually  low-carb  Aussie cheese fries. They were simply cheese fries. Your answer, if you were like me, would be, “Cheese fries? No, thank you. I just ate two cows, a pig, and half-a chicken at the house! I’m watching my weight, thank you very much!”  If you were to walk into Subway today and tell the sandwich maker that you were watching your carbs, he would say, “Hey, no problem. We’ll just put this in a nice carb-free wrap for you! Enjoy!” If you had asked this same sandwich maker to watch the carbs six years ago, you might have suggested, “Hey, why don’t you just wrap this in some old turkey fat. I’m watching my carbs!”  The Dr. Phil diet seems to really work, although the secret is pretty simple. Are you ready? Here it is: Watch your calories and exercise. That’s it!  And every physician in the continental U.S. is going, “Why didn’t I write that down?”  This is the stuff they’ve been telling us for years. For those of you interested in the Dr. Phil plan, it is a lot more complicated than that, and there are some interesting psychological lessons for why we are addicted to food. All I know is that the farm animals can rest a little easier in my neighborhood tonight. There are no carb diets here.
Only   Years of age come by Quickly of heart and Rapidly aging forces of Wind and grateful charms; Of yonder year and  Seam beyond border of Tireless and beckoning  Call of the wilderness harms. Telltales go up or Will underdog win by  So much as a wink Or a call to bear arms? Might only year beckon Self for a while if the Chore might dredge on And might soften the farms.
