No, not really :) I had a good day today. The day went by very quickly. Maybe that was because I slept until 4pm. I woke up, looked at the clock and said "Holy crap!! I have to be at rehearsal in 3 hours." I've never slept that late before without having been awake until 8am in the morning(which I've done many times before :). It's probably the reason why I'm awake now :) Anyway, rehearsal was great. We were supposed to run all the blocking for Act 1 but only got through the first scene because we were polishing everything. It's looking great. Ro and I have done a good job so far, if I do say so myself :) After rehearsal, I hung out with Ro and we watched a couple episodes of "Dead Like Me", which is an awesome show. I watched it a couple of weeks ago on Showtime On Demand and I told Ro "You so will love this show. You've got to watch it." Do I have good taste or what? Of course, it's easy for Ro to like something. He's a loser!!! I'm writing all this because I know he's going to read it :p Anyway, I have to get up in 4 1/2 hours so I'm heading for bed. Ben Folds in 17 hours. Report after the concert tomorrow!!!!!! Yes!!!!!! More later..........
Tonight I went with my family to my dad's cousin's house. We went to do some visiting and some swimming. The water was too cold for me which sucks because I wanted to try out my new bathing suit. Ah, well.  My niece, Shaylee, went into the pool for the first time. She loved it. She had an absolute blast. We had a good time. Grilled some burgers, listened to her husband talk about Farenheit 9/11, recalled good old times with my sister. I had a good time but then I started thinking about things that have been getting me down lately and I kind of brought myself down, so I called it a early night. I came home and watched Road Rules and then Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. I really think I'm getting better at picking myself up when I'm down. I was watching RR and started feeling better right away. Either that or I'm just getting over being hurt....finally. It only took me a month after the fact to start getting better. That's something my sister and I were talking about. She said to me "f your ex was here, he'd probably be sitting next to you instead of being with the guys talking about that movie because it would still be early in the relationship. What, like a month and a half, right?" . "Yes" I told her. "Can we drop it please? It's already hard enough for me without you bringing it up." I've figured it out with the help of my sister that since I'm not sure exactly what ended the whole thing, that is the reason I've been so down. I've just been racking my brain with what I could have done wrong. It doesn't help the fact that everyone I know still asks me about him and says that(even though we dated for like three weeks) we were a cute couple and seemed to be happy together. The one thing that kills me is when people who think they're being helpful say "You're both so sad lately, ever since you decided to not see each other anymore."  Okay people. Not my decision. Totally his. I just didn't want to ruin any fragment of feeling he might have for me by being a bitch. I have a feeling I was, though. I also feel that all my stress from theatre stuff didn't help it any either. He probably won't talk to me again. I'm dealing with it. I know now that he just didn't feel the same about the relationship situation as I did. It's a part of life. We deal with the cards we're dealt. I know that, hopefully , in a few months, I'll be able to watch Family Guy, look at the sofas at the theatre, and sit on Ro's futon without feeling sad. I digress. If I don't get better, I'm moving to Boston to live with my dad's family :) Move away and on from everything. I'm talking about this because it's better out than in. On a happier note, Ben Folds on Wed!!!!!!! Hooray!!!!  More later!!!!!
Well, I've been offline for over a week because our computer had several viruses on it. Being the lazy, busy person I am, I had no time to find a computer to do anything on. I am now typing on our brand new computer. I was told that I could have the old one if we can get it cleaned up and running again. Some weird, kind of sad news: I have been diagnosed with having depression. I'm not all that surprised. I've been rundown lately and not in the mood for much of anything. My parents are concerned about me being like this. There are certain things that would perk me up but alas, I won't be receiving my wish anytime soon. I knew there was something wrong when I was watching Adam Sandler movies last week and not laughing at all. Well, that's not entirely true. I watched Billy Madison(my favorite) and laughed my ass off. I've never watched that movie with anyone else, just by myself. There are only a few people that are allowed to watch that movie with me. They can probably guess who they are, but I won't reveal names :P Anyway, the depression thing. Even theatre hasn't picked me up. Cuckoo's Nest opened on Friday. I got depressed thinking that I won't get any flowers during this show because I never get flowers from anybody. Not even when I was directing Birdie last year. Silly things like that get me near tears. I was out with my family and we were talking about going to my c
