Well, today was certainly interesting. Me and Alyson met Tony and went and saw "The Village" which was amazing. I thought that it would be kind of campy from the beginning, but the movie got really good and it turned out to have one wicked twist. We saw Sarah today...at the movies. Today really proved to me that things between us will never be the same. First of all, she didn't even notice me and Alyson sitting outside the movie theater, waiting for Tony, until I said something. Then, she didn't even bother to stop and talk, but rather walked on by and had nothing to do with me. Afterwards, we talked for like five minutes, but it was a wasted effort. She didn't want to talk to me at all. You know, I at least tried to be friendly, tried to show that I could be the better person, just as Alyson did, but it was all fucking useless. I don't know why I bother trying to be friends with her...it's like trying to be friends with a fucking brick wall. She can talk to me on the internet and email me, but she doesn't want to be near me in real life. What kind of friendship is that? There is none anymore. The next time I talk to her, whenever I decide to, I'm going to tell her that I quit the coven. I can't handle being linked to her when she doesn't even want to acknowledge my existence in front of her friends who she seems to like better than me anyways. Makes me fucking sick.  ~With this knife I'll cut out the part of me, the part that cares for you~ -Smile Empty Soul "With this Knife"
Have you ever just hated someone, hated them so much that it drained everything you have and left you feeling empty and cold? That's how I feel right about now about my parents...I'm not used to playing this whole "backseat to what I want" thing. Lately, all my parents do is go out and spend their money on drinking at Ya Ya's...not even seeming to care that we are sitting here waiting. Why is it always about what they want? I mean, they can't even fucking take responsibility for their own kids. It seems like all the kids in my generation have parents who, plainly put, just don't give a fuck, and then they wonder why we're all so fucked up in the head. They wonder why their kids kill themselves, or cut, or start doing drugs and drinking...it's all just to kill the pain. My mom has even started doing it...she was always home and always there, but now...she would rather stay up there at that fucking bar then come home so we can eat. Money got shitted down the hole to pay for their bar tab, and they wonder why I keep getting depressed. I have to worry about whether my younger brother is going to eat dinner that night, and whether or not I'm just going to decide to cut and get it over with. Every time this happens, I start thinking back to when my dad was the one gone and my mom was home...now, I have to put up with my dad staying home and bitching about my mom getting drunk...that is, when the both of them aren't out. I have no life, no freedom...it's like I'm trapped being the adult and they're the fun loving teenagers who don't have to worry about it. My mom drowns her depression in alcohol...why should that be any different from me dragging a razor blade across my skin? My parents just can't see it...every time this happens I die a little more, another bit of myself rotting and falling away. Makes me wonder...would they notice if I just left...or died? I don't think any of the parents of our generation would... they are too busy wrapped up in their own lives to worry about us. It doesn't matter if we're screaming, bleeding, or dying...all that matters is that they're having a good time. Fuck that. Fuck that and fuck them. And by the way, mom and dad...fuck you too.

Today was an awesome day. Alyson and I got the day to ourselves, and we finally went to the tea room like we've been wanting to and I might be able to get a job there! I would love having a job there...the atmosphere is great and the people are really nice. Also, I might be getting my mom's car to drive when school starts, so I'll actually have a car! I&nbsp;can't wait! I want to drive to school so bad, and I'm thinking about taking short day so I'll get to spend more time with Alyson during school time. I'm not really looking forward to starting school, but at the same time I am because I'm finally going to be a senior. One more year of high school...that's absolutely insane. I remember going into junior high and thinking I was cool. Now look at me.  We also went and saw Gwen and baby Grace. She's so precious...makes me want one. Hopefully one day I will be able to have a baby with the person I love the most. *looks at Alyson* Things will be great...I just know it. Going to go see&nbsp;a movie tomorrow with Tony...it'll be nice to see him as well as everyone else. I miss our little group of friends, and Tony is going to be going to the Louisiana school...so he won't even be there. Things change so much. It just amazes me is all. Well, off to bed or if I can't sleep like always, I'll write something. I can't wait until me and Alyson get the site going...it'll be great!  ~The more things change, the more they stay the same~  -Someone I
