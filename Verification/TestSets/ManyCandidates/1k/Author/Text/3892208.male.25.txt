When I moved to the city back in Feb '03, it was a point in my life that I just needed a change.&nbsp; At that time, I was getting to be pretty anti-burbs and I was too excited to live in the city to think that I might even miss some things that the burbs had to offer.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  However, last night I had a little revelation.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was driving to my parent's house to pick up some protein I ordered from   urlLink  www.allthewhey.com    (this place is great btw), and right before I got to the entrance of our subdivision, something hit me.....just a quick flashback or something of that nature, but it was pretty cool.&nbsp; As I rode down the little Frontage rd. that leads to their house, I passed the field that is followed by the lake in the backyard.&nbsp;&nbsp; Something just hit me, maybe it was the humidity and the scent of the cleaner suburban air, who knows what it was.&nbsp; Regardless of that, I just let that feeling come over me and it brought me back to all of those late summer nights and all the stupid shit I used to do when I had the summer off........not trying to dwell on the past, but that was a pretty easy time of life.&nbsp; I guess its just that maybe I was able to capture a moment in my mind, and it's so easy to pull that memory out and atleast bask in the short memory of who I was then and what I thought my future held.&nbsp; I know that someone out there that is reading this has the perfect comeback, she's saying "You need to stop looking at the past, Dan."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well ya know what?&nbsp;&nbsp; The past makes us who we are today; this isn't a question of living in the past, rather it is a subtle reminder of how much life can change and how we all think that there is always going to be something better out there for us.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holla at ya'boy!
First off, I really hope that Mark Prior isn't out for the season.&nbsp; Secondly, Dooman, thanks for having me believe that Nomar was coming to the Cubbies..........ass.    &nbsp;  Back to me hating the mornings......Every morning it seems like I just want to sleep that extra 5 minutes, even though it won't do me any good.&nbsp; Starting off the day is such a routine process, physically of course.&nbsp; Mentally is a whole different story.&nbsp; The day before, I have done all I can to make sure that I am physically and mentally exhausted so that I don't think about that one thing that has been haunting my mind.&nbsp; However, when I wake up, I'm at my most basic state.&nbsp; I'm not thinking about work or my meal timing for the day or how I'm going to jack up my PR or my 6pm date with the CFC or what I am going to dress up as for the 80s party on Saturday.&nbsp; NO, I'm clouded by my inner thoughts and feelings and chances are that she had some small role in a dream I had last night.&nbsp; You can't stop the mind from wandering, at least, I can't.&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;  We used to walk these streets together and now I'm hoping that I'll never have to meet you. &nbsp; &nbsp;
Your life at any time can become difficult.  Your life at any time can become easy.  It all depends upon how you adjust to life.  It's never the situation; it's your reaction to the situation.  You cannot always control your circumstances,  But you can control your own thoughts.  It's not your position but your disposition that matters.
Okay another "wtf" thing:  wtf is up with this shitty clothing line?  I just took a short walk down the street and I must have seen 20 people wearing Hollister clothing....?  From my understanding, they are comprable as old navy is to Gap.  Why advertise that shit?  And to make it worse, the people wearing it were easily into their 20s and wearing this garbage.....get a fucking clue people, let the kids wear that stuff.  And don't get me started on Von Dutch or w/e the hell that is called.......sorry, but a $45 hat that probably costs $.20 to make is just a joke.   BABY JESUS LOVES ME .
Just finished some Popeye's wings, spicy...good stuff. Why the hell is it not steaming hot outside, considering it is mid July? Downtown Chicago is pretty kick ass in the summer, I like the women that tend to dress a little more risque for their desk jobs, it gives me something to stare at as I walk down Madison ave and try to get my mind off the fact that women, as a whole, are not to be trusted(not you though Mom, I love ya!)......ALTHOUGH some of them should definitely keep covered up, that's for sure(yes, I'm talking to you, you large woman at the Citibank bldg......look, your huge flabby arms are bearable to look at, but I think it was the fact that your pale skin was totally peeling all over your black shirt....almost made me want to vomit(but I couldn't do that to myself, I'm wearing a nice shirt and I would have to go home and change). Speaking of shirts.....I'm having a problem now that I have been hitting the gym hard after a  nine month layoff : button downs do not conform to my body, either you have to be skinny as hell or really chubby to fit into them correctly....in 3 weeks, 3 of my shirts just don't fit right in the chest/back area....WTF?? I might have to only wear moo-moos or something until I'm back to my normal size, whatever that is.
Okay, for some reason I couldn't get my blog to work all last night and this morning, until the whiz-kid Sean came back to work and changed the forces of the internet with his mad style and he got my shit up and running.    So this morning I am waiting on the L platform a
