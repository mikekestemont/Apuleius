Nothing can heat up quite as much debate in religious circles as new medical breakthroughs—be they in the creation (cloning) or ending of life (abortion, euthanasia), or anywhere in between. So when Life published a special issue focusing on 21 breakthroughs in medical science for the 21st century, we knew we had to review these with a focus on how they would affect religious faith. All of these are now in existence under clinical trials which could be complete around the middle of the next century.   1. Memory drugs. Scientists have discovered a method for manipulating the gene responsible in part for long-term memory. They’ve been able to give fruit flies a photographic memory, and are hard at work on a drug for humans based on this discovery.   2. Attacking schizophrenia. E. Fuller Torrey has developed a ‘brain bank’ of more than 100 brains from schizophrenic and manic-depressives. Samples are being studied by groups around the world searching for the cause of the schizophrenia. Some are hunting for genetic clues, others for traces of a virus or a faulty neurotransmitter.    3. Edible vaccines. Researchers have developed a method for infusing potatoes with a vaccination for traveler’s diarrhea. The potatoes become living, low-cost vaccine factories, but because they contain no virulent agents they can’t cause an infection. This could become a low-cost way of delivering vaccines to the Third World.   4. Treating age-related blindness. Researchers have developed a new method for treating severe age-related macular degeneration (blindness in old age) by a two-step process involving a light-sensitive drug and very cool laser beams. This process is less dangerous than the previous one using ‘hot’ laser beams.   5. Blocking angiogenesis. Tumors are fueled by their ability to spark the construction of new blood vessels (angiogenesis). A new antiangiogenetic therapy halts this process, causing tumors to practically melt away. In a few years this could represent a cure for cancer, but it has further applications with more than 75 other diseases, including coronary artery disease, strokes, and AIDS.   6. The Smart Shirt. Scientists have developed a smart T-shirt with embedded sensors (like electrocardiograms to monitor the heart) which can transmit their signals to a satellite and thence to any location on Earth. These are useful for monitoring at home patients, police officers, athletes, or soldiers on a battlefield.   7. Herceptin therapy. Traditional cancer therapy is to throw as much poison into the body and hope it doesn’t kill good cells as well as bad ones. Herceptin is a ‘smart bomb’: it directly attacks the message system used to tell cancer cells to replicate wildly, and has few side effects. It’s been successful with some breast cancers.   8. Artificial retina. An implantable computer chip translates image information from a camera mounted on an eyeglass frame into electrical impulses which it passes through the retina to the brain. Early test patients have been able to detect motion and shapes. Others are working on a hybrid electronic-biological artificial retina.   9. Gene therapy. Scientists are using ‘suicide genes’ to attack glioblastoma, a fatal brain tumor. A modified leukemia virus (able to enter human cells but not cause the disease) carries a herpes simplex virus which produces cold sores. These infect the tumor, and are then killed using an antiviral drug. Since the virus infects only dividing cells, normal healthy brain cells aren’t affected. Genetic therapies are in development for more than 200 individual diseases, and are anticipated to be worth $3.5 billion in sales by 2005.   10. Eradicate polio. A global campaign led by the World Health Organization, UNICEF, Rotary International and the USCDC could eradicate polio in the next 4 years. The next target will be measles, which despite an effective vaccine kills 1 million annually.   11. Designer hormones. Tamoxifen was originally developed as a contraceptive, but failed (it actually almost guaranteed a woman would become pregnant). It’s estrogen-binding properties, however, have enabled scientists to revive it as a drug to ward off breast cancer. Other ‘designer hormones’ could prove useful against Alzheimer’s and hearing loss.   12. AIDS vaccine. There are seven different vaccines in process (AIDSVAX is the most advanced). The AIDS epidemic is taking a terrible toll on Africa and Asia, and the UN anticipates a large population decrease in those areas. More than 21 million Africans and 4 million Indians are infected—unless a cure is found, some whole countries could simply cease to exist.   13. Stem cells. One of the most controversial researches involves fetal brain stem cells, which can be used to grow virtually any organ or tissue without the problems of rejection. A US ban on fetal research limited the availability of cells for study; but a recent experiment has led to the ability to multiply fetal brain stem cells in a laboratory, leading to a potentially endless supply and avoiding the ethical problem that led to the ban.   14. Cancer vaccines. A new process is underway to develop vaccines that teach the body to cure its own cancers. New research is making it possible to develop more accurate vaccines. In some trials, patients have showed tumor regression of more than 50%.   15. Holograms. A computer can now be used to generate three-dimensional pictures of the brain: useful for precise measurement of tumors and anatomic relationships: important when neurosurgery cases can fail over a difference as small as a millimeter.   16. Aging. Researchers have discovered more than 20 genes implicated in longevity. They anticipate tremendous strides in the biochemistry of aging in the next five years, and a thorough understanding by the middle of the next century.   17. Stress management. The National Institutes of Health is funding a $30 million research study into stress management after finding that depression and isolation can kill cardiac patients and that stress-reduction techniques can lower blood pressure and heart rate.   18. Genetic screening. Some day you may be given a genetic ID card which knows everything about you—including what diseases you are susceptible to. This could eliminate privacy but could be useful in discovering and stopping genetic diseases: a miniscule blood sample could reveal the p
