Martha Stewart should be let of the hook, the only reason she is in such deep shizzle is because she is a celebrity. Which is totally wrong, because your govermental status should not be judged on your social class. So what, she took a tip from her broker. If I got a tip that I was going to loose money, hell, I'd sell it in a heart beat. That is just sick that the US government would destroy a womans life for doing what anybody else would. Free martha!
Very recently, my grandmother began to rave about how she hates imigrants coming into america, and how they shouldn't be allowed to live here. This angered me, especially since she brought up the worst cliche ever, They are taking our jobs. You are wrong. w-r-o-n-g. They aren't stealing or taking our jobs, they are getting their jobs. I'm tired of the people I live around talking about how their parents are unemployed because a mexican got their job. I see so many things wrong with that sentance. The mexican got the job because he is more qualified. If the parent really wanted that job, he should get off his butt and go get it. Apply yourself people. Now another thing, is that people complain about how the imigrants get payed minimum wage. Well, guys, that is giving them a favor, because if they weren't payed minimum wage then the whole reason that the company hired them is because it was cheap labor. So by paying them minimum wage, it is doing them a favor, by keeping them on the pay list.  &nbsp;   &nbsp; Who do you think is more happy? The woman getting payed for small tasks, or the man who doesn't get payed? Some people will say that he simply was cheated out of his job by an imigrant, geuss what, there is a reason he lost his job, the other person was more qualified. He could have been sleeping on the job, or drinkin on the job, which just goes to show you, that it is his own fault. Get a clue people, just because an imigrant kicked you out of your job doesn't mean it was his fault, it means that it is your fault. Here is my&nbsp;4 step solution. 1.buy / rent a nice suit 2. buy new shoes 3. Go get a new job 4. work hard and get payed. Hey, steps one and two don't even need to be compleated, it just helps to add to the quality of job you get. Hell, I could get a suit, and go to a hotel offer $2 a bag, and carry them to people's rooms. How much would I mke in a day? $50? $60? That is enough to live off of. To be fancy, I will do the math. Say it is $15 to eat every day. Now subtract that from $50. You have $35. Now multiply that by 5. $175 a week. (you could also work weekends). Now if there are 52 weeks in a year. That means that I could be making $7020 a year. Whic is far more than any 14 year old should be making. So lets take it a step further. If I worked at McDonalds for $5 an hour. Say I worked 40 hours a week. that is $200. Plus you can eat some of the food, so I will take it down to $8 for food. that means I make $160 a week. x 52 = 8230. Which I could make in highschool alone. Now that means I could buy a new car. Now lets take it one step further. You make $7 an hour at a pizza joint. so that is at 40 a week, 280 a week, subtract $8 for food, and you come up with $240 a week! Plus tips which I will estimate are around $40 total. (that is the least). So you are back at $280 X 52 = $14560. Not bad for a teenager is it? Now I could be making more money than some grown adults, only because I would be trying harder. See, now you would complain the youths are taking your jobs. geuss what we are not. It is the elders that give them to us. So get up, go out, and work damnit!
Okay so lets talk about politics. I will mainly be basing this on the American election for 2004. So who does Spike want to win? Good question, because to tell you the truth, I haven't even decided yet. They both suck. I don't like those men. I wish it were hard to choose because they were both so good, but sadly, they are not. You have Bush, an ex alcoholic, soldier who went awol and on top of that a daddies boy. And an over concerened show off who wants to give more to the people, so long they pay for it. Bush, dives into pools headfirst, water or no water. Like the war, he just jumped right in, with no thoughts of the after shock. Well geuss what! You say we are safer. Safer my butt. I expect terrorists attacks on us for at least 20 years. They say saddam was using wmds, yeah well geuss what bush, you were wrong. Then they say that Saddam was the wmd and that he was very evil, well geuss what, he did some bad things, but not so bad that he would STOCKPILE WEAPONS OF GENOCIDE! Good job all you politicians who think you have the public's support, you are wrong. Don't think I like Saddam, he did some fucked up shit, but in all honesty, that aside, he wouldn't have hurt the us for a while. We liberated Iraq! Why? For the people? NO! For the oil? Maybe, For the political insecurity that will keep them in an economical depression, keeping them from ever rebelling their American overlords? Yes. Now, as for Osama. He attacked us. He destroys two buildings, so we bomb the&nbsp;shizznizzle out of afghanistan and t
