Dear Sweet, sweet reader/s,  Last night Katina and I hosted a show at the PIT. I had never produced before and hindsight is always eh, 20/20. So as I sit here and type with my new vision- I'll detail the ways things could have gone better.   For starters the Pit had no a/c... for those of you that cannot decipher a cryptic anachronism, A/C stands for "air conditioning." NO AIR CONDITIONG IN A PACKED THEATER IN LATE JUNE???  Management did not notify me of this little ditty nor did anyone help to cool down the room. It was so hot I was frosty the snowman up there. The audience found it hard to cackle when they were drenched in their own salt water. It was simply nasty.   Secondly, We way over booked. I basically offered spots to lions at the Bronx Zoo and it was complete chaos.   However, in spite of it all we had some real talent that rose to the occasion. Carmen Lynch, who has been in HBO's Aspen Comedy Festival did a set as did Madame Funnypants who are always stellar.   Some people bit it- and others triumphed- despite the ticking of the clock and the pools of sweat that dripped to the floor.   However, a few of Stokes's campers were unhappy. They felt they went on too late, they were pissed I over-booked and they were upset they didn't shine like they usually do.   Here in my friends lies the clear distinction between someone who holds-up in the face of adversity and someone who buckles and cries like a little boy.   I've learned a lot about the differences in people's characters. I have never been one to be sympathetic to the self-deprecating "poor me" types that creep and crawl around  this business- but now I am completely turned off.   Allow me to edify you in performance protocol. As a stand-up comic you pay your dues. You do shitty open mics where you wait 2 hours to get on and play to one person. You bomb on stage and you're subject to content criticism. You either decide that stand-up is not for you- or you keep at it. If you decide on the latter, you become tougher- less judgmental- you try to be less self-effacing and learn to adopt a "never let them see ya sweat" mentality.   Last night some folks espoused the following sentiments "I usually get a better response." One guy bitched and moaned "I didn't want to go up there."   If you are a performer that gets up a lot- one gig melds into the next...plus, you are always one gig better than before. Especially after braving a tough crowd.   In addendum, you never, ever approach a producer or friend and tell them anything less than "Thanks for the spot." If the show didn't go well they probably feel bad enough. You don't have to lay your deflated ego on the floor for them to trip on.   I've done plenty of dreadful gigs in the past three years. And, I was never less than gracious to my host. If someone thinks so highly of your work that they want to showcase you- then they have your best intentions at heart. If you are frustrated (as I have been) then go home and vent to your roomie or stab your teddy bears eyes out- Don't show your egotistical vulnerable side to me- I am not Dr. Phil... and I have one of my own, thanks.   As to you people that were troopers (with dignity intact) you know who you are and I thank you.
I absolutely adore Margaret Cho, but I am having a hard time vibing off CK.   Who is CK you ask? A former client of mine. You see I dabble in real estate during the day. Yes, or course stand-up pays the bills... but I'm just such a people person, I must interact with the general public.  CK, is a design student at Parsons and ran me around the city like a wild boar. I couldn't understand a word she said. We'd walk into a East Village pad and I'd literally say, "You like?"  That's how we interacted.   I must have shown this little hussy 95 apartments. Because she told me that she currently lives with "cockroach."   So, she finally decides on this apartment on 12 b/t second and third. Sick location. She tells me, "I have guarantor- he own gas stations." Great! Fantastic! Deal.   The chick explains that the person who's going to be paying her rent is (get this) "My father's relative." Ahhh hem, now wouldn't that be your relative too...? OK.  Long story short, the "father relative" only shows 92K on the books. Not enough for this little bitch to score the place.  Here's the worst part, I collected 100 bucks from her for her application fee and in a moment of weakness (because I fear bad karma) told her she could have her money back. However, I've already spent it: Lunch at 7A, a shirt that reads "NY Doll." you know the drill.   I ran her around for free, she lied to me about qualifying for an apartment.. and GURRRR!   Now she's calling me speaking in broken English and giving me one hell of an attitude problem. I told her she can come and get her cash and she replied with "You tell me that already." Ohhh ummm... can you let me know when you're coming to get it ass bag? I hope the roaches nibble at her toes while she sleeps. If I come off obtuse or unfriendly in this post, please refer to other post where I am more amicable. Thanks!
Apple Martin? Why Gwyneth? Why?
I've recently decided to sell things. You'd be surprised what people will buy. I recently approached a gruff looking gentlemen... about 40ish on St.Marks Place. I said, "Hello, Pablo (he just looked like a Pablo) would you give me a dime for my Zippo?"   Pablo looked skeptical at first, then acquiesced. He produced some change from his pocket and announced, "Because you're so p
