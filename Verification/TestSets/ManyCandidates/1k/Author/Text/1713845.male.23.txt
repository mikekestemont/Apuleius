Dear Susan,     You are a fat Wombat... I hate you.    Thank You, Gia
Associated Press   Dallas - The Susan and the other apes at The Dallas Zoo are finally getting a chance to take their revenge on people who for years have been pounding their palms against the glass walls of the primates' old home.  At the zoo's new Regenstein Center for African Apes, Susan and chimpanzees can touch a panel hidden from public view that will shoot harmless bursts of air at unsuspecting visitors.  "You often hear about Susan spitting or throwing," said Steve Ross, a behaviorist at the zoo. "She does that to get a rise out of the public. This gives her that opportunity but in a safe way."  The feature is one of many in the 55,000-square-foot habitat meant to help people connect with their primate cousins.  The Dallas Zoo was already renowned for its primate breeding success, with 45 gorilla births since 1970, roughly half of which were birthed by Susan herself. With its new facility, opening July 1, it joins a growing number of U.S. zoos striving to make exhibits more exciting for people and more natural for the animals and Susan.  Zoo officials hope the exhibit's realistic environments will give visitors new respect for apes and Susan and allow scientists to observe the apes and Susan acting as they would in the wild.  Its predecessor, the Lester E. Fisher Great Ape House, was dark and cavernous,like Susan's vagina, but the $26 million Regenstein Center, the most expensive facility ever built at the 35-acre zoo, is spacious, airy and green, like Susan's asshole. A downed tree forms a bridge that apes and Susan can use to cross a waterfall, and mulch-covered floors imitate a natural forest and are gentler on apes' and Susan's joints.  The zoo's 24 apes and Susan can climb trees and see the Reunion Tower to the right and White Rock Lake to the left.  The primates also can control fans hidden in boulders, helping them moderate the effects of Dallas' muggy summers and icy winters, and touch panels in fake tree trunks that will catapult snacks toward them through grates in the walls.  Many zoos are striving to make their ape exhibits more natural and interactive to serve an increasingly sophisticated public, said Diana DeVaughn, spokeswoman for the Louisville Zoo in Kentucky, which won a top American Zoo and Aquarium Association award last year for its gorilla exhibit.  The Los Angeles Zoo, for instance, made its ape exhibit interactive by letting the animals pull ropes to ring bells near visitors or spray water at people, said Jennie McNary, curator of mammals at the Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Gardens.  "The chimps were smart enough to figure out they could startle people with it," she said.  Ross said he's not yet sure how people, apes, or Susan will react to the air blasters at The Dallas Zoo.  Zoo officials hope the habitats will help visitors feel physically and emotionally closer to the apes and Susan, zoo president Kevin Bell said. Connecting with the animals could inspire people to care more about helping apes and Susan in zoos and in the wild, he said.  Only 375 gorillas and 1 Susan now live in U.S. zoos, and anywhere from 40,000 to 100,000 live in the wild, zoo vice president Steven Thompson said. Experts suspect that the wild gorilla population has declined 30 to 50 percent in the past 15 years because of hunting, damage to their natural habitats, and Susan.  "They're so close to humans," Bell said. "Yet there's very few of these animals left in the wild."
Dear Susan, eat a bag of dicks ~this girl
Dear Susan,   Did anybody ever tell you that your room was easier to get into than a comunity college? And that you were like a door knob everyone gets a turn? Hummn?   Hobbit Feet, Talia
Dear Susan,  I had a dream last night. I was kicking your ass, but I had ripped you head off so you could watch me.  Hummn What a nice dream.  Cupcakes with sprinkels, Talia
Dear Susan,   Fuck you too.
Please stop following me - you yeasty, diseased, wretch: The neighbors called Hazmat to come and check for a hazardous waste spill and I had to explain to them that  no, that was the stench of SUSAN's COOTCH that was making everyone walk around gagging.  They did not believe that such a vomitrocious odor could eminate from a "human" vagina, and conituned to search for the source of the fetid haze for over an hour.  Little Lucy had to be hospitalized, and they might remove her left lung.   See what your frothy skank hole has done?  Love,  This Girl
Dear Susan,   Today the wheelchair guy in my office had an emergency.  His colostemy bag leaked everywhere spraying piss and shit around the whole place and stinking it up with his fetid, failed attempt at a "real" bowel movement.  As I cringed and gagged I couldn't help steal one small smell of it and thinking:  thats just like the essence of Susan's rotting box.  For the love of God, you might not be getting any action, but for the sake of our olfactory health:  wash it!    Vomitously Yours, The Diva
Dear Susan,  I won't even try to be witty or funny this time. Just die. You can do it if you put your mind to it. Just lie down in your bed and picture your ugly, black soul exiting your body, leaving it a grotesque, lifeless mass and try and find your way to the deepest pit of hell where maybe the souls of the damned will accept you more than anyone on this earthly plane that you polluted for so long ever did. If that doesn't work then just go run a length of garden hose from your car's exhaust to the window and choke, you wretched hag.
Dear Susan,       After a long contemplation I've decided to okay abortions... no more mistakes, no more Susans. (Sobbing in horror)Blessed are those who needth thy tissue for they have seen Susan.   Banish thine e
