I was doing some research for my novel, searching the web for a little history of the term 'WASP' and when it was first used. One of the links that came up on Google led me to a White Nationalist web site called  urlLink Stormfront.org . I poked around it a little bit, and now I feel somewhat sick.   It's easy to forget how many hateful assholes are out there. But what's really surprising to me is the fact that they're actually literate. I mean, the spelling and grammar in their bulletin board posts (with subject lines like "Cultural Differences, or are Blacks Just Plain Stupid?") is actually not bad. Which suggests that these people read books. And if they read books, how can they be so goddamned ignorant? I suppose if the only books you read are along the lines of  Mein Kampf , you can write a decent sentence and still have Neanderthal views of race and humanity. Still, it amazes me that people who think like that aren't living in caves and eating their own excrement. As they ought to be.
Thought some of you might like to read Paula's article at: http://www.listener.co.nz/default,2034.sm  Why doesn't everyone check and post on the blog as obsessively as I do?
I cut and paste this quotation from Matt Bivens' "The Daily Outrage" Blog which appended to thenation.com's home page.  ______________  It's hard to improve upon the opening to this dry, tiny Reuters report :  Two rehearsals for his prime-time speech were not enough to keep US President George W. Bush from mangling the name of the Abu Ghraib prison that brought shame to the US mission in Iraq.   During the half-hour televised address, Bush mispronounced Abu Ghraib each of the three times he mentioned it ... English speakers usually pronounce [it] as "abu-grabe". But the Republican president ... stumbled on the first try, calling it "abugah-rayp". The second version came out "abu-garon", the third attempt sounded like "abu-garah".   White House aides, who described the speech as an important address on the future of Iraq, said Bush practiced twice on Monday before boarding his helicopter for his trip to the speaking venue ...   If you want to see it for yourself, go to the White House web page for the President's speech, and click on the video option. Start listening 20 minutes into the speech -- just at the two-thirds mark -- and all the various mangled iterations of Abu Ghraib come in quick succession.   Reuters gets it basically right. But they don't quite communicate the look of angst that grips the President's face at his first effort, which actually comes out:   "Abugah ...   [Pause; President bobs head in internal struggle to shake free third syllable; a truly anxious moment when one feels a stab of sympathy for the man, and wonders if he'll be able to pull it off;]   ... rayp."   [Heavy sigh of relief. He did it! Hooray! George W. "low expectations" Bush surprises and pleases us once again. And to think he only had to practice twice beforehand!]
Items of possible interest: 1.  I and my books and my pots & pans have arrived at  urlLink my destination .  16 hours of driving over two days--decent time, uneventful.  I spent the night in  urlLink Barkeyville, PA .   2.  In Illinois there was a conspicuous amount of fluffy floating seed-carriage whatevers being blown across the interstate.  Makes me suspect that the cottonwoods are blooming.  If they are, you should take a walk in the park near where I used to live, on the corner of  urlLink Benton & Mormon Trek .  With the seeds drifting down the place looks like a set from  urlLink Legend . 3.  It's hot as fuck all on the East Coast.  My balls are sweating!  Sorry, but they are.  (No link on this one--)   4.  I must have listened to Pavement's  urlLink "Range Life"  ten times in the last 48 hours.  I love Pavement.  They seem always to be saying, "Be sad, just not too sad.  Also, be excited." 5.  I do miss Iowa.  I also hope it never goes away. 6.  I am in the middle of reading Aleksandar Hemon's  urlLink "The Question of Bruno."   I love it so far.  Two awesome descriptive fourishes that seem recently appropriate and of which I am jealous:  tomato slices at a cookout "sunk in their own slobber"; a TV in a motel room "facing the bed patiently, like a dog waiting for a treat."  (Suspiciously enough, I saw no dogs in Barkeyville.)  Anybody reading anything good lately? 7.  I love you all.  D says hi.  Be good.
I'm sure I'm not the first one to posit this theory, but it seems to me that America's fondness for disaster and apocalypse movies, such as the about-to-open destruct-o-rama,  urlLink The Day After Tomorrow,  is akin to getting off on being spanked. In other words, as an adolescent nation we sublimate our guilty knowledge that we are too wealthy, too powerful, and eating too big a piece of the world's pie. That repressed knowledge manifests itself in a desire to see our cities flooded by tidal waves, destroyed by earthquakes, invaded by aliens, and the like. We've been a very naughty nation. Ooh, it hurts so good!  One would think that in the Post 9/11 world, this sort of sanctioned, masochistic pleasure-seeking would ebb a bit. For awhile, it seemed to. But I'm guessing Americans will throng to the theaters this weekend, salivating and slightly aroused, to watch America be destroyed (by global warming, no less) in glorious technicolor. The same way we glued ourselves to our TVs for hours on end on 9/11. Did we really need to keep seeing the planes crash into the towers, the people hurling themselves from the windows, the buildings collapsing, again and again? No, but we watched anyway. I did, too. And part of me would love to go to the theater this weekend and see a tidal wave take out Manhattan.  Somehow I suspect that if I were French (or Indian, or Korean, or Polish, o
