i changed my blogspot address...my original reason was i don't want him to be updated with my activities anymore. coz its like, he's there watching me from a distance and im inside a glass or something.   seesh!and what i hated most is that it is quite obvious that he doesn't want to communicate with me. like i emailed him and asked how he was...he would just reply that he's ok and was sorry he wasn't calling or writing.i even called him...last week of may. we talked for a maximum of 4 or 5 minutes only. i felt excited to talk to him but at his end...i dunno!   i kinda confirmed that he IS deliberately avoiding me. i read his blog for last week and he wrote it there. not communicating so that "things won't get complicated". i rest my case.   it saddens me...but im still hoping. i'll just pray for him and for everything that is happening right now to both of us.
Guys tell: What matters most   By Matthew Sakey        For all their similarities, guys also display great variance. As satisfying as it would be to cynically insist that every man on earth is interested only in willingness to copulate, bust size, leg length and sympathy to scheduling issues during football season (in that order), it's not a fair judgment. Many qualities guys look for are intangible, so if you're in the market, be advised that most men value these features above all others.   1. Tolerance This is often interpreted as "sympathy to scheduling issues during football season," but it's really much broader than that. Guys like what they like — whatever that may be, and it will certainly differ from guy to guy — and though they might make an effort to respect your feelings about their pastimes and viewpoints, they're not likely to change them for you. Guys want to be with women who don't roll their eyes when they head out to play D&D or insist that a visit to the shoe store is more important than hockey playoffs. Respect their idiosyncrasies and they'll respect yours.   2. Compatibility with friends His friends aren't necessarily going to become your friends, but you need to be able to stand their presence. In fact, it would help if you like them a little, always remembering that they are his friends, so a certain boundary needs to be respected. There will be times when he wants to be with them rather than you, and if you like them it'll help clarify why. Similarly, a guy's friends and his relationship do not fill the same section of his heart: he needs both, and prefers when they fit together comfortably.   3. Honesty and decency Men don't like being cheated on or lied to any more than women do. If you're a chew 'em up and spit 'em out type, your life will be a string of one-night stands followed by a bitter spinsterhood. You man must feel he can trust you without question, and it is your behavior that will ensure he does.   4. Independence This is a tricky one, and it doesn't apply to every man in the wild, but there's a good chance he prefers to be with someone who can own and operate their daily lives. The complaint that he needs his "space" when a relationship sours is actually an indication that he feels constricted by your failure to manage your own affairs and respect his occasional need for privacy. You made it to adulthood without him; surely you can continue being self-sufficient now.   5. Comprehension of differences Men, being from Mars, think before they feel. When men discuss problems, they do not commiserate, they offer solutions. This creates a huge communication gap in relationships, because a woman wants emotional support while the guy uncomprehendingly suggests a resolution. Neither side is right or wrong, but women are hard wired to be feelers and men are hard wired to be thinkers. Understanding that he is not being callous or short when he tells you what he thinks rather than what he feels will score you lots of points.   Men are complicated beasts, and it's no wonder that women still struggle to figure out what motivates them. We're all people, but there are some fundamental differences, and equally fundamental misconceptions, in what each gender wants from the other. But men aren't the shallow goobers they're sometimes made out to be, and giving them the benefit of the doubt in this will mean lots of potential mates from which to choose.
i can't believe that things would turn out this way for me...i try not to think negatively about the situation but i can't help it. ok, maybe im just feeling bad about nothing. i might be over reacting. hey,i don't want to shout or what. but i just feel so bad already. as if nothing happened! ok,so he might be "too busy" with his "new life" right now. and obviously, im not even a part of his so-called "new life" now.   evaluating everything that i've done in the past: i wasn't quiet aggressive nor complacent. a couple of times,i've been forward (but in a good way, i guess). coz it's really obvious that he needs a little pushing or shove from his side. and i believe i let him out a little. (which im really happy about) i've been honest with myself and to him all the time.
it's my fault Chona, not yours. you and I will have a long talk about this. ryt now is not the time. i still got personal issues that needs to be taken care of.    I'm sorry if I really made you fell bad but believe me, I didn't do it to hurt you.
hi! i was suppose to write you a letter and send it to you there but i read your blog the other day and you've transferred na pala.   anyways, i really wanted it written coz email seems impersonal (just for this particular one).   i really don't know where to begin....   the past few months, i
