Well, I have 2 hours until I'm finished for the day (thank goodness!) and then I don't have to come back into work until next Monday because Guy and I are going up to Newcastle for the weekend. We don't leave until Thursday morning but tomorrow we are going to see an immigration consultant about Guy's sponsorship. We're applying for him to become a permanent resident (not a citizen) and to do that, I'm going to sponsor him. Basically I just have to say that I'll take responsibility for him financially&nbsp;and show proof that we've been together for a year, which we will have&nbsp;been&nbsp;in&nbsp;October. We have to show proof of joint financial ventures (bank account), utility bills, travel, entertainment (movies etc) We also have to get statutory declarations from our friends/family stating that they know we have been together for 12 months etc etc. It's a lot of work but I think it will go through fine, especially considering we know&nbsp;people who have been through the process, lied and got through,&nbsp;and we're being completely honest.&nbsp;  Just in case you're interested (don't blame you if you're not!) but the rats are starting to get better. Their tails are starting to clear up but they're still chewing themselves loads. Poor little things. Hopefully they'll be ok with us gone for a few days, I'm a bit worried about them.  Oh by the way, did you like the photo on my profile? It's old now, but I chose one of my most hideous just to impress you all! It was taken in London (Angel) at a Warp Records party where I got to meet Bjork and we watched Aphex Twin play. Very cool indeed. I think I look like Bugs Bunny in this photo - I was very drunk on Vodka &amp; Red Bull at the time.
While playing with our pet rats Bruno and Jasper last night, we found that they had little red marks and scabs on their tails. Everything else seemed to be ok, except for a couple of little bumps on Bruno's ears. So this morning we took them to the Vet, thinking that it was either a skin irritation or mites. The Vet did a skin scraping from Bruno's tail and couldn't find any mites/lice but found eggs! Ewwww! He even showed us through the microscope, it was pretty gross. So we were given some bird mite/lice spray (?) and told to clean out their cage thoroughly (as we always do)&nbsp; and to spray them and their cage.   So then we came home, had a cup of tea (thanks to Guy!) &nbsp;and started on the laborious task of cleaning out their cage from top to bottom - even more thoroughly than usual, while the rats seemed completely oblivious to our toil as they ran about on the stairs. After all the events of the day and the rats journey in the box to the Vets, they were all tuckered out and after several bits of cheese for being so good,&nbsp;fell asleep curled up in a little ball&nbsp;together in their hammock. Guy and I, knackered, curled up in a little ball on the lounge and watched a documentary on Tasmanian Devils.   Tonight we're off to an Italian restaurant with my brother Jason for dinner, so that should be cool. It's&nbsp;too cold here to do anything&nbsp;that involves being outside&nbsp;for too long.&nbsp;The days get to a maximum of 13 degrees or so, which in UK terms is nothing but after being back in Oz for a while now, it's bloody freezing! Sometimes I think our flat is colder than it is outside too which doesn't help.&nbsp;
I can't sleep - It's 11.55pm and Guy is snoring away as usual (I find it very hard to get to sleep - and yes I've tried *everything*) So&nbsp;I thought I would share something amusing with you. My boyfriend's name is Guy Hawksworth and he was in the Navy for 6 years (hey stop laughing, that's not the amusing part!) Anyway, one day we were bored and doing searches for each other's names (as you do) and his full name came up with only one match...   urlLink http://www.themysteryreader.com/goldberg-exposure.html
Have you ever thought to yourself "What the hell am I doing here?" I guess this can be taken in any number of ways. Why am I alive? Why am I working here? Why am I&nbsp;in this city?   Well today I'm thinking "Why am I working here?" I've had this thought for quite some time now and it's not so much a problem with this place exactly, it's more a problem with what I do. I've got 4.5 years experience in IT support, I've managed to get through that time with the&nbsp;minimum amount of training, mostly getting by with on-the-job experience.&nbsp; It's not just that I hate studying, it's that I don't truly enjoy the line of work that I do. I feel very undervalued, I'm sick of talking to customers on the phone all day&nbsp;and my voice is constantly croaky.   I'm on a Service Desk (helpdesk) you see and after 4.5 years you would think that I would have progressed past this by now. The problem is, that I *have* - when I lived in London, I got into Desktop Support and they provided me with Microsoft Training. I completed 2 MCP (Microsoft Certified Professional) exams in Windows NT - to give you an idea, that was two Operating Systems ago so needless to say, they're pretty out of date now. Seeing as I haven't updated any of my certificates since then, it's near impossible to get any positions other than senior helpdesk&nbsp;roles. I don't want to do any more studying in IT - I'm bored with it. I think I'm pretty good at it and I get a buzz out of solving the complex problems, but the everyday boring calls and abuse I get on the helpdesk are just making the job unbearable.   So what am I going to do? I have no idea... I would sincerely love to do something different and my brother Jason tells me t
