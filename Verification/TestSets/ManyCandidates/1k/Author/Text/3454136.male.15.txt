No one's gonna bother with this blog... like ever...  Anyways, I was bored just now and since a friend told me to, I'm posting.  If u've read my main blog, u'd no, cleaning, like all other chores, is now up to me... I'll have to get up tommorow and vacuum. To make it fun, I play to do a little pretending while vacuuming.  I'm brain-sucking alien from the planet Vacuumius. I've come to Earth and with earthly vacuums as my weapons, I'm gonna suck the brains out of those puny bugs in the carpet. Hahahahaha.
Grin . Welcome! I made this role-playing blog cause I was bored and I hope this grants me some fun :). Anyways, role-playing by urself is no fun, so come join me :). In return, I'll share some of the fun, ok? Hehe.  Let's c, this will be a loose role-play kinda thing so that'll be a bit of tolerance for role-switching and out-of-role-ness. Just don't do it too much, kk?  Oh of course... Since only blog members can post, u'll need to be a blog member to role-play :).  Anyways, here's my first role:  Hello, I'm Criff. I'm a mage-in-training. Well, technically not a mage cause I can't really cast any spells... But, c, I got this kool sword. It's got these kool rune carvings. My teacher says it's created by his ancester, Alchemist Bran, with the aid of the Runesmith Raken. This sword means a lot to me. It's the key to make my dream come true. My dream... it's like this. There's a city, one that u might've heard of. It's called Druwyn. It's a place where the most powerful magic users gather. In fact, there's a rule for entering Druwyn: Only those who are either born in Druwyn or highly talented in the use of magic may enter. I want to go there. Because... because my father's there. He's a powerful archmage and I want to measure up to him. This has always been my goal. I was set offtrack, however, when the New Rune Academy rejected me. They said that I couldn't use magic at all. I was soon back on track, however, when I set out to seek a mage who could teach me to use magic one way or another. That's how I came to my teacher and this sword. But not before someone whom I had grown close to died. I'll never forget Belth. He was a friend and a mentor to me. Nevertheless, I have to go forward towards my dream, with this sword in hand. What exactly does it do u ask? Maybe u'll c if u c me fight...
This week is gonna be hell, but then look at the bright side, 9 more days of school left.  June 2: English written exam June 4: English ISU June 8: Drama exam June 16: English exam June 18: Business exam June 25: Report cards June 27: My 16th birthday  I feel kinda weird now, because i'm sitting here waiting for Alex to call, i'm turning into one of those girls whose life is based on someone else, it's sorta a good feeling, i mean, i really like him.  but on the other hand it's not, because i love the sense of independence that i use to have, i miss it, but i like how things are like now, i wouldn't trade it for the world.    I should be doing my career studies homework, but i can't concentrate, and for the first time listening to jay chow doesn't help anymore.  i'm sitting here talking to mike about the one thing that i wish i didn't take, but it's not helping.  School is acutally getting fun, it's probably because i get to see Alex, but i'm actually enjoying the classes now, well, it's about time, i would say.  My lip is getting better, i should thank someone for that.  *wink* Today's weather was good, only if it was a little warmer, or i had a jacket or something, i love the sizzling rain, but i got a lot of goosebumps.  i'm waiting for baseball to come on, yes, i'm a toronto blue jays fan, but it's not on until 10, 20 minutes away.    apparently, i need to get my act together, i'm getting a 74 in business, and according to my parents that's not good enough, not even near good enough, in this house, 80 is passing, and if you don't want any lectures, about 90 is what's expected.  But hey, i'm not that smart, and my mom knows taht, i think she's just lecture me a bit, that's all, hopefully.  now, Alex called, got to go.  my priorities are straight, i think.
I finally decided to have a blog... maybe because i have nothing better to do at this very moment.   i think the fact that all four of us got blogs are so that we can stay in touch with each others' daily life.  I'm sitting here, seem to be waiting for something, don't really know what, don't really care either.  I sometimes don't understand why people let some of the things get to them, they all seem upset, angry... sometimes i think it's not what's really happening, just what they think is happening, it's all a matter of reception.  now i sound like someone who has no problems, but trust me i do, we all do, but the point is not let the problems lead to other problems, the trick is how to solve it, scream, swearing are all just temporary methods people use, but the real problems still remains, i know i'm making it sound too easy, but the fact is that it's not that hard if you just jump out of the box.    i should be a phsycologist ( if i learn how to spell it first), it hurts me to see people struggling.
well well well, it's finally my birthday! i finally made it to 16!  i'm getting my G1 driver's lisence next week, then i can start driving, so exciting.  thank your for all t
