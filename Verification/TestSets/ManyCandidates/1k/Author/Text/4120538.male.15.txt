Today was my last day of freedom. ha! Lisa and I went to the Great Mall and watch "The Village." It was ok. We took so much public transportation. ahh! Got lost a couple of times. haha. Talk more aboot it later. So tired. See you at school PEOPLE! night!
Tired, tired, tired. Woke up around 11:00am. I was supposed to be at SLA (buy books) at 11:00am. So got ready as fast as I could, because the book sale was going to close at 12:00p.m. I couldn't go get the books from 1:00p.m. - 3:00p.m. because of my basketball game. But all is good --got there around 11:30p.m. The only juniors I saw were Sam and Stephanie. Lots of freshmen. $288 bucks for books. WTF mate?       The Good News:   I HAVE A FULL LOCKER! Sweet MONKEYS!       We lost the bball game. BUT ALL IS sexy, because I scored 6 points --that's what counts. lmao. Went swimming after the game at the YMCA with my cousins. fun crap! I'm so funking tired. night . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . .. .. .. . ..
I had to get new pants for school today. I'm just growing like bamboo. Dockers all the way home doggy dodo. So gangSTER - I know. I also had to get some basketball pants. I tried on these black shorts, and they were very cozy, but then I looked in the mirror, and they were see through -bad bad idea.     Had basketball practice today. It's been a while, with vacation and all. One of my teamates dyed his hair pink for some reason. Everyone got a kick out of that. Gots a game tomorrow. Going to kick some ass!      Rented "Johnson Family Vacation." Kind of reminds me of my road trip to Canada, cept we didn't pick up a pyscho voo-doo hot girl hitchhiker that steals Fruit-Loop boxes. ha ha. night man/dudes/dudedetts (spelled wrong)/chicks/chickens/the homeless/Lindsay...yeah I'm done. NIGHT!
Went to Office Depot (why don't they pronounce the "t?") today, to get some school supplies. I went to the Office Depot in Mountain View because the one near me is evil, and unorganized, so I have no idea where anything is. MOTHER! School starts in exactly a week. ah! Why must summer go to the beyond? Also played some b-ball at the park. I'm getting better. I bought 2 locker shelves at Office Depot because they break to easy. Also walked to Walgreens, and on the way there these Asians near Tin-Tin Market were doing Tai-Chi or something. Really interesting. I tried copying them from a distance, didn't work out that well. ha ah ha ha.       Tomorrow I'm going to see a clown midget! She's very odd, she's tries to ryme everything! And sometimes the sentences turn out wrong. Don't ask. Well ask if your dying to know, which you all should be!!! ASK!      I'm going to watch the "Bend it like Bekham" movie again. night
School...not that excited about it.       The highLIGHT of my day was going to a moooovie with Moogan. Went to see "Princess Diaries Dos." Total chick flick. ahhhhhhhh! Some parts were funny though. ha. Moogan was 15 minutes late getting to the theatre. women........ I wanted to see Collateral, but it was rated R. And people over at AMC14 actually   care,   and ask for ID's. After we walked around. We some how walked into a furniture store and almost broke some stuff (well I almost broke stuff). Lamps cost so much now-a-days; $212 for a funking lamp??       Watched "Bend it like Beckham." Best Indian/English/Scottish/?Russian? movie I've ever seen. I'm going to bed. I have no idea what I'm going to do tomorrow. :)
Today was my very first time at the Great Mall!!! I must say that it is 'great' because it has almost everything - like a moooooooooovie theatre. I called Jason around 8:00a.m. to awaken him, and of course he didn't wake up until around 9:00a.m. Have I ever told anyone that I can't take the bus by myself, because my mom thinks its unsafe (WTF mate)? Very embarrassing. And Jason lives so far away, and no one wants to drive me. So what I had to do was meet him at PGA (Paramonts Great America), my dad drove me there. Then once I got there I'd meet Jason (which took 2 light rails to meet me) and take the light rail to the Great Mall with him. ahhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!! To many things of public tranportation, and parents driving. GOD!! I had fun though.. Played at Cyber Cafe most of the time. Awesome stuff. After, went to his house (took another light rail) and chilled like an ice cube.       Tomorrow I'm going to go see a movie with Moogan!       MY CELL PHONE WORKS!!!! Finally! ....night!
ah, Monday! Today was almost close to being boring. Let's see, what did I do today? Woke up around 10a.m. Talked on thy phone for a long time...that's rare. Went to the library to renew some DVDs, and got some weird books. I walked to the library, it's the one near Calabazeas Park. I thought it was far, but ehh, it's not that bad of a walk. So on the way back home I stopped at Walgreens to get a C2. lol. I think C2 is the best coke, taste so freakin' good. I was looking in the candy section when I noticed a Rolling Stones magazine. And guess who was on the front cover?? Lindsay-POO! So I bought it just because Lindsay was on it. There's this picture of her sitting on ice, and it's very sexy. ha. ha. ha. ha. She was wearing only underware on the bottom. I wonder how she kept a straight face? Then walked over to Eaton to practice basketball, but all the courts were filled up. How crappppp is that? So walked back home and listened to "Too Young," by PHOENIX. That song makes me dance like a crazy mother. Played poker with the family. My mom actually won.       Tomorrow I'm going to the Great Mall with s
