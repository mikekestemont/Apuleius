Mood: great :) at Sophia, Jonny B, Aldred, Rachey, Lynne-Marie 8-) at Wilson Listening to: Queens of the stoneage - No one knows  Raar, sorry for the long update!  Been busy busy busy!  It was Fran's b/d last Wed... her party on Thursday!  So we all went there (minus an Ian... he claims due to coursework, I claim it's lieeeees :p) so I was winding him up trying to make him come :p.  So loads of ppl met up in McDonalds in Castle Gardens... but Fran forgot to account for the fact it was the England match!  So we all wanted to go watch it :| planning lol.  In the end we came to a compramise: Rilleys :p play pool and watch the match!  I got a tad tipsy after a few too many pints!  Still managed to win a suprisingly high number of games :p but then Ruth, Sam and Jamie left... which soured the mood a tad... they all went to get pizza and get the bus!  I mean Fran's ment to be like their best friend!  So they leave half way thru her party to go home!!  So she was far from impressed :s and then England lost so we all left.  Fran offered me a lift with her mum... who was there within 5 mins :| (West Cross to town!!  Should take about 15!) still wearing her England shit, I suddenly realised it wasn't a great idea :p was a tad scared lol.  Theeen... Kung Fu... Angi, Hannah, Charlotte and Dai braught down alcohol!  Ooo dear, second night drinking!  Got absolutely plastered and mildly annoyed Angi by drinking her (full) drink when she gave it to me to hold for 2 mins while she went outside for a cigarette :p whoopsie!  Then came home, said many things I shouldn'tve to people online... whoopsie again!  I think I've corrected them all now :s haha  On Saturday... went out shopping :) my mum's birthday, failed to get a pressie but never mind, I'm going into town again twice this week!  Buuuuuuuuuuuut, at random, I gotta txt from Sophia :) aint tlked 2 her in soooooooooooooo long!  We hadda massive txt convo, talked on the fone for about an hour last night and arranged to go for a few pints on Thursday to catch up :) *sigh* been so long!  Ooo and on Friday, I'm meetin up with Rachey and goin to see Shrek 2!  (no-one else wanted to :( miserable buggers!) so we're goin by ourselves!  Ah well, should be good!  I really cant be arsed with college anymore.  Jonny B came into physics half hour late coz his mum's away (we were all over his house yesterday being noisy when his mum rang :p ooo dear :p) and we were really bored... so we mitched the rest of the day, went over his house, teased his kittens, played games and ate angel delight which was most fun!  I have to hand my physics coursework in tomorrow, so I best go do that!  ahh who'm I kidding, I'm going to play TimeSplitters :p
Mood: Happy! Listening to: Blink 182 - Wasting time :) at Everything  Had a gd few days! finally gettin back to havin fun after exams :D  Not been to any lectures really!  Big n sweaty (our affectionate name for the maths mechanics lecturer, Judith) rang my mum yesterday to say I haven't been going to maths... my mum's response was "Exams are over, sorry Judith... you're just too damn fat!".  Looks like I wont be taking maths next year :| although it was very funny!  Last few days I've been on drugs :p the scary scary things that cure my back pain but make my vision go purple and give me hallucinations! :s  Yes that pink elephant was trying to steal my left leg!  :$ so the back pain's been gone :D but knowing me, I'll twat it over again doing something dull!  :p  My neighbours moved out today, at last!  I've had a bit of a vendetta against them... they kicked my cat once... 7 speakers, a subwoofer and a powerful amp... up against the joining wall till 3 am :) all I can say: Tim wins :D  Today, Jonny B wore kinda stupid (very amusing) shorts!  Whenever he moved too fast, they'd compress his groin!  So Matt was trying to make him move suddenly all day :p so harsh!  And Wilson was doing his manwhore act and ignoring us... so we were throwing things at him, all simultaneously texted him saying "you suck, we hate you!" and slapping him etc until the girl he was trying to impress just laughed and walked off :p (he does hav a g/f!) and then Yumi got offered a lift home and there were no seats left in Jonny B's car... so he was far from impressed lol (but we were happy... she's a really lovely person!  RHCP concert 2moz :p so everyone off to that!  Then planning the beach on Friday!  busy busy busy!  Tim
Mood: Ill.  Very ill. Listening to: Maroon 5 - She will be loved :) at Rachel and Rhys :@ at flu  Ach, I'm very ill :(.  I thought my flu was going away but I appear to have had a relapse.  Arses.  And because of the antibiotics, I can't take my bloody painkillers!  (I did my back in saving someone's knees a fair while ago... long story!) but it needs an operation... and till then I get some loverly painkillers that stop the bugger hurting.  Buuut im not allowed with these antibiotics or bad things could happen :(.  The doctor gave me different ones... I took one last night, it made my vision go purple and me go insanely hyper and happy :| so I decided I'd stay off them for the sake of my sanity!  Now I have a lovely mix of flu, hayfever and a knackered back!  Woohoo :|  I've been advised what to do with the Katie thing... a load of people were arsing round the subject... the only person w
