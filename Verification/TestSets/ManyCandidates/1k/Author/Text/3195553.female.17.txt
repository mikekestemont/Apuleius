I understand that you don't want to commit, but you don't have to lead me on and make me think otherwise. You obviously lied to me because you have found other people since you regurgitated me. You raped my heart like the sinister threat of a naked room, a think cloud of abnegation coldly forms above your head, a smile spreads across your face, I am free from the sepulture you have placed me in. Hurting people is a second nature to you. Screams of terror exonerate your ears as you shit on me my very emotions for everyone to see after you swallowed them whole. You want to forever damnate me to the depths of my own jealousy, stupidity, and sorrow because yo disrelish me so. You abandoned me because you ravaged me until there was nothing left, you used me for your own presonal gain. You took everything you wanted and then left me there obliterated because you wanted to ease your pain. I was so naive to your ways and then I realized that you never loved me it was all a part of your act that was beneficial to your self-confidencebut you were so inconspicuous that nobody knew what your real intentions were. I guess you wanted to conspire against me, you hate me and want me to suffer consistant to how self concious you are feeling. I don't understand why you think you are so elite. You pretend to have a distorted vision when in truth you are just searching for a little reassurance to make you feel better than everyone else. I trusted you but the truth came out. You want me to drown in your own self-gratified exceptionalism, all you want to do is execute your plan to make me feel inferior to make me feel how you feel, but you were just a distraction to keep my mind off the pain but now that's over with you but the pain stays and there is nothing I can do to sustain it. It is lie the sadistic thoughts of a catholic priest dying to be alone with the child within.......
She cuts her arms when things get too hard she's a horrible person damnated forever to relive the things that she has done wrong she tried to change but there is lost time to make up for she tried to save her soul but she took too long she cuts herself with a swiss army knife because she thinks all the pain will better her life all the times she was left in the dark, time has penetrated skin and left a mark the guilt is eating her alive she has ran too long from the things keeping her down there's no more time to run and hide no one gets out alive, no one survives I've taken my own life there is still blood dripping from the knife
I swallow my pride as I'm raped on the inside I hear you coming so I run and hide my thoughts of killing you subside as I wish I had died but it doesn't matter, what can I do, I'm nothing of use, nothing to you all the pain you brought, all the lessons you taught, all the times you lied and got caught I think my life is over don't say you can't see it, or maybe you can and you just don't believe it I can't see myself living without all the times that I was in doubt I dried off my eyes and denied everything but a knife in which I cut myself because it felt good and I wanted to see blood but I very seldom could because there was always an interuption or something to stop me but that great once and a while when I was alone that was when I felt at ease because I know myself that I will kill as I slit my wrists and watch the blood spill
The reason I didn't cry was because I saw you laughing, making fun of my feelings of which you raped criticizing laughter at the least just let me go in peace I want to be free of your grip why can't you just release you haven't let go I can see it in your eyes and you'll never ever know that I've deciphered all your lies, I remember you told me that I'd never see you cry but I saw those tears come from your eyes you're so pathetic, why did you lie you could have told the truth and I would've excepted you but I believed all the lies that you told me I believed all of your lies I bought all the bullshit you sold me but you did it just to get a rise you won it's over but next time you won't be so lucky someone will do to you what you do to others and I hope they do it soon because you deserve all the pain that comes to you I hope they make you bleed I hope they make you cry I hope they cure your greed I hope you never lie you haven't let go I can see it in your eyes, you'll never ever know that I've ever seen you cry
My faith is gone anything I've ever believed in has been crushed with my last breath drawn I utter your name in utter disgust you've gained my blame and lost my trust the only thing keeping me alive is my hatred for you, my despise this isn't a disguise I patiently anticipate my demise yet no one knows that they won't survive no one cries no one cares the sirens blare as everyone stares life is unfair that's to be expected but no one's aware that my life is so fucked up and I swear I found a tear in the web of my dreams and this wall has been shattered as if that mattered because no one even hears when I let out a scream it's not what it s
