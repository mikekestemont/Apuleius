The concept of a "new economy" in the 21st Century stems from new wealth, once drawn predominantly from natural resources and tangible commodities, achieved through innovative ideas mediated by new mind tools, viz., technology.  The tools, of course, innovative to start -- having seduced a multitude of speculators to invest in what can only be described as abstract spaces  -- now form the basis of innovations that could not have been realized without sophisticated technologies.  Since the start of micro computing, investors have gambled on the emergent new tools, most making monumental profits.  Today, large organizations such as governments, academic institutions, and corporations are determined to uncover with certitude the key to nurture intellectual property.  If the new economy is rooted in ideas, viz., arts and sciences, those with greatest interest in capital gain seek to enrich the individual and society on the basis of harnessing creative capital.     Clearly it is a peculiar condition we live in, where the brightest minds are sought after as the new natural resource. In deference to artists and scientists alike who have not profited from creative capital in the same manner as producers and distributors, we salute you. Speculators beware -- there is no more certainty in the value of goods and services arising from hard commodities than arising from the creative mind.   Just as the Dutch in the 17th century could not have foreseen the demise of their precious tulip by a fickle public, neither can we be certain of the knowledge market.  Those who seek the best minds from which to profit will also find that, like all economic venture, minds are as unpredictable as the marketplace itself.
When we   read, write, listen, speak , we engage the most important tools for shaping the mind.  Newer  mind tools   (i.e., new media) have been developed over the past twenty years, drawing us into the New Economy where creative capital is edging out traditional economies.

Brilliant! I love the comments that are beginning to surface...if you haven't read everything on the blog yet, go ahead and surf...be sure to read the comments under each post...  I just had an "aha" moment! Deductive logic (“It’s elementary my dear Watson”) brings fruitful ends! Science as a “way of knowing and doing” is a powerful method for discovery.  Whenever one is puzzled by a phenomenon, careful observation will often reveal a pattern, which then leads one to further investigate.  The result may yield uncompromising truths!  There is a reason for the "time delay" between the second you hit "publish post" and the time it is published!     It turns out that Blogger offers a special feature for the administrator.  Comments that are published are first sent to me to review via email.  Once I have downloaded your comment from the server, which I may want to delete if it is “inappropriate,” Blogger then publishes the posting.  That feature is an excellent one for teachers using Blogs with their class, as they may wish to censor or delete comments before they are published.      I recommend saving your comments in a word document in the event your posting is inadvertently erased.
I just have a string of thoughts from today...more paradoxes…   I wonder what is meant when children speak of learning that is "real" rather than “fake.” The  urlLink  24 Hour Film Contest   felt very "real" to the students at Newton Learning Center. When pupils speak of "fake," what does that mean? What is the difference between "academic" literacy vs. "practical" literacy?  Is there such a thing as practical literacy (or is that called functional literacy)? For that matter what do we mean when teachers are admonished to make learning “meaningful” and connected to “real” life? Take the performing arts for instance, meaningful to me but not considered a “real” profession – worse, as my eldest daughter continues to seek the stage (aspiring actor), all I can hear in my head is – “get a real job.”  Hmmm.     So what do we make of literacy?  Into what has the term "literacy" evolved since the time of the Gutenberg Press?  In the beginning it meant to be "alphabetized" (the term used in French), and we acknowledge that mass literacy has been a key to the past 400 years of evolution in science, math, technology, economics, industry and so on.  Now we speak of multiple literacies but what does that mean?  Does it mean “literacy” that goes well beyond "written text" the staple of the past 400 years of mass Western “literacy?”  What do the “experts” say?     Anyway…to be highly “literate” in our Canadian society is valued because of the link between the highly literate and the highly innovative. Yet in what sense do we mean “highly literate,” academic, practical, specialized (i.e., field-related), generalized?  Which form of literacy leads to the brightest minds (and I might add honed and focused athletes)? If this is our new “call to arms” for teachers in the 21st century…how will we get there?  What do we do with the minds that will never shine because of genetic barriers?  Moreover, what do we do with all of the “social” problems that make “literacy” issues trail in the dust?  Or is this somehow all related?  Hmmm...and the beat goes on...and the beat goes on...la di da di da...la di da di da...
First day of class!  What an extraordinary group of individuals!  Each person, expressing so many interesting viewpoints from diverse contexts, contributed to a look at the fascinating paradoxes in education.  Can we connect some of the themes?  Go to the  urlLink  on-line textbook   to view the first link called “Context.”  You can surf the four topics,   gender, age, multicultural, language,   to uncover what language theorists are saying about literacy.     Here is what I wonder.  If spoken word is such a vital part of our linguistic heritage and given that we are such social beings (Vygotsky), why does our teaching in the 21st Century continue to be so didactic – so 19th C
