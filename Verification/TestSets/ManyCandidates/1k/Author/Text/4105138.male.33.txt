sorry i didnt get a chance post yesterday . Tom my conutter was haveing all sorts of problems with his partner so i was doing providing  a frendly sholder for hiom most of the evening . I think they have things sorted now so all ended well.      I had an apoinent with the diatcian yesterday :) youll like this.  Im trying to sort out an apointment to have my gastric band tightend a lttle as im still eating way to much and although im not puting on weight  my weight loss has ground to a hault. unfortunatley thats not prooving  easy as the hospital and in particular prof baxter team are very streached and ive been waiting since the begining of july to see someone about it . so after me phoning up loads of times and doing the pestering patient bit i finally get to see the diatician. after a good long natter it turns out that im eating all the right stuff at teh tight times just eating to mutch  NO SHIT SHERLOCK !!!!!! thats why i had the band in the first place and why i was trying to get it tightend a little. gesss what :)   the diativcian dosent now hoew i go about gettign my band tightend eather aaarrrrrrrrrggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  oh well shes going to call prof baxters team for me and ill chase them up tomorow too hey ho :)  we had a bit of a rethink with the website and weve asked ken to help. if you have seen the memborship page on the WLS info site thats pretty much exactly what were looking for , for the dsonation page, so ive asked ken if the chappy who designed that page might be able to design a similar one for us to add to the wlsinfo trek sight :)  right beter dash of as i have a friend ocming over shortly  and i need to get the house loking semirespectable LOL ttfn
