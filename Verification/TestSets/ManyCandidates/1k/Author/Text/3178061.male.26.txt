And in other news, Fenris the poet has written yet another offering of poor poetic skill and lackluster verse to sate your thirst for wanton sillyness and tom-foolery with this bit of fluf called "Can't Help  Hating You Now"  enjoy...   At the end I wish I still loved you I wish my feelings  Would last a little longer Than that song we both liked I wish it had been forever I wish I held you in my heart  Close to what is important  I wish that you were important I wish that you were important to me I wish feeling would last I wish hunger would last I wish we could last I wish For so many things to come to you I wish I wanted you I wish I needed you like you don’t need me I wish I could feel a part of you in my soul I wish I could feel me in you Not for sex Not for lust But truly for the reaching  Stretching for a bigger soul I wish I smelled you when I wake I wish I heard you in my house But the delicate plant that we grew Between us is dead from neglect Not long ago it passed into death Here at the end I wish that I held you Not for me Not for you I wish for the sake of holding I wish for the sake of loving  I wish for the return I wish for feeling I wish for … I wish                                   Bent.
I was listening to Nirvana on my way to school today.  for those who don't know, (which is most) I live a half hour from work and school.  that time makes a great buffer between home and the other two.  I was listening to Nevermind.  Yeah, you all owned that one at one time or other, I know.  I myself like Bleach and In Utero more, but ya take what ya can, hey?  anyway, as I was coming to school, I found myself running a single lyric through my head "I found it hard, it's hard to find, the will what ever, nevermind."  or that is what it sounded like to me.  and I started to think about that, I know, first mistake.  Anyway, I was really digging what I was coming up with about that one bit of the song, with Cobain ripping the song from his soul up and out his mouth.  And I thought about how hard it is to keep the desire to live day to day at the grind.  I thought about primary motivation, what gets you out of bed in the morning. For me, it honestly is my faith in my God, my Heavenly Father.  For you it's something different.  But we all have a primary motivation that helps us face the day, to find the will to accomplish what ever we need to.  what's your Prime Motivation?  Answer silently.
well, here I am just a few minutes later, I decided that I should post another poem.  This one goes with my heart felt thanks to Weis and Hickman for Dragonlance, and most especialy Sturm Brightblade, yeah, I know they will never read this.  I don't care.  I am sharing, because I want to.  Any way, here it goes...  Paperback Knight  You’d never know I live two lives, One out here and one in books. When I read, I move  Into a world of knights and swords, Armor and honor. With my own invented history.  “My Honor is my Life.”  Ranks of knights form and chant, Swords held at salute. Steel glows in the morning sun. The blade I hold was my father’s. I belong to him, much as the sword did. The sword his tool in life, I’m his tool in death.  “Est Sularus oth Mithas.”  The line of my family reaches long. Into the past our house extends,  Many knights of the Crown,  A few of the Kingfisher, And less of the Rose.  “My Honor is my Life.”  I mutter this oath to a pretend God.  This fictious code of false knights. Words in a language existing only in a book. The unreal world this way of life comes from Ends when I press the halves of a ragged paperback together.  “Est Sularus oth Mithas.”  Imagination fades, The book slides into my backpack. These knights slip from my mind.  Their wars and vengeance fade, But I am left with the oath. This code of life in a world I pretend to know.  “My Honor is my Life.” bent.     If you havn't read Dragonlance Cronicles, pull your head out and get to it.
So, there I was at dinner, someone asked me what the most profound thing I have learned in the past year has been.  This comes at the end of my first semester as a colege junior. I thought about all the things that I learned in m upper division English classes, I thought about my spirituality, and lessons learned the hard way from the Old Man.  I thought about the two failed attempts at meaningful relationships and one real possibility, I thought about the new and growing relationship I have with my parents, and how I see them in an entirely new light.  I thought about a lot of different things, and the final result came when I read something a friend wrote about feeling content.  I have to say it simply, the biggest thing I have learned is how to grow and strive to be a better human being, and still be content with my progress so far.  Am I in a rush to find love and get hitched? no. Am I ubber involved in my church? no, involved yea, but I have time for alone time, which I need from time to time.  I am growing, and not b
