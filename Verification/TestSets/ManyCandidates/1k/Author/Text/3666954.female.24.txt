The thought of drinking black coffee always seemed appealing, yet still intimidated me to a degree so high that it was starting to border on being a paralyzing fear.  Sounds silly, I know.  Don't worry; I have my reasons...petty as they may be.  While it sounds foolish and outdated, it worried me a little that predominantly men drink their coffee black and maybe it would make me look less feminine if I did the same.  Also, I rarely - if ever - pass on sugar and/or dairy if ever given the option.  However, the main reason is that - while I love it so - coffee is so damn bitter that it seems it  needs  to be diluted with  something  to make it palatable.  Yet the pangs of my punk-rock conscience plagued me.  You see, most people have the angel/demon on their shoulders.  Not me, that bullshit of heaven and hell never concerned me.  Oh no, I have two other characters that appear on my shoulders.  First there’s the popular, mainstream friendly girl on my left, and second the anti-establishment, pissed off punk bitch to my right.  These two are the extreme ends of the spectrum that my personality reaches – and the punker nearly  always  wins.    Except on the issue of coffee.  Every time I upended the jug of milk or sugar dispenser, a spikey-haired, steel-toed boot wearin’ little punk bitch appears on my right shoulder, whispering to me,    “If you like coffee so damned much, why do you have to dress it up until it’s unrecognizable as itself?”   I’d shrug her off, without even bothering to summon the popular girl, knowing exactly what she’d say and that I agree with her entirely,    “Because it’s yummy and sweet, sillyhead!”   Over the years, and as time progressed and I gained a fuckload of weight from all the pounds of sugar and gallons of half and half – among many other variables and foodstuffs of course – being dumped into my mug each morning.  So I started scaling back.  Instead of the sugar, I’d use sweetner…instead of half and half, I’d go for the skim.  Boy that little punk bitch started screaming riot-rants into my right ear so loudly that my hearing in that hear has to be worse than  any  scenester’s who survived the 70’s Manchester scene.   “ Splenda ,  WHAT THE FUCK?!   Are you fucking  kidding  me?”   The little pop girl within soothed me, assuring me that I was doing the right thing for my health, my body, all while still having  relatively  the same experience as before.  About a year of the berating/reassuring – not to mention losing a lot of weight – I would start splurging here and there, using half and half or whole milk and real sugar to season my coffee.  If you’ve ever done it, you know how good it is…so nice to relive the indulgence, if only momentarily, so that you remember what you loved about it so much in the first place.  But that naggy little bitch still wouldn’t shut the  fuck  up about the black coffee.     “Fuck, you’re such a fucking sissy.  I can’t believe you won’t even  try  it.  This from the same dumbass who drinks sugarless tea!”   I had to admit, she had a point there.  I could see - before even summoning her - that this was one argument the pop girl wasn’t going to win.  It was funny, I never thought of it that way.  My eyes were open anew, and the flooding light of enlightenment poured in.  I  do  love my Mississippi sweet tea just as much as I do my unsweetened iced goodness.  It was final, there were no excuses to be made any longer.    The next day, as I poured my coffee, I filled my cup to the brim, not even leaving the temptation open for milk addage.  I must admit, it was a bit like cliff diving for the first time; the whole “horrible fear that there’s a possibility that you may not be happy with the outcome of your actions” thing.    …I put the cup to my lips…  …took a deep breath…  …and let the hot, black fluid roll over my tongue.  And you know what?    It was pretty damn good.
Not literally, of course, otherwise you'd have seen me on TV this morning being awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor by Senor Dubya himself.   No, it happened in my dream last night.   Which I find strange, as I don't necessarily  hate  Osama Bin Laden so much that I'd want to kill him personally, especially using only bare hands and a garden hose. While I think it'd be a good thing if  all   members/leaders of extremists groups (ie: the Far Right, the Far Left, Feminazis, Fundamentalist Christians, Al Qaeda, Vegans, PETA, etc) would  chill the fuck out , I certainly don't wish death upon them.   I think it's kind of a bad thing to wish death upon anyone; however, I get exhausted and infuriated with preachy assholes who can't just let the world be - personal belief differences and all. And yet, I don't feel peace is the answer, nor even a remote possibility. There is no cure-all answer, as human beings have been and will continue to be a greedy, self-serving, win-at-all-costs species until every last one of 'em is killed at their own grubby little hands.  I look at the sky at dusk and see a beautiful sunset, only to be instantly reminded that the colors I marvel at are there due to man's pollution of the air. I step outside and feel the warm sun on my skin, only to remember that the excessive burning of fossil fuels is causing the temperature to rise at exponential rates every year. We already have to wear sunblock if we're going to have prolonged exposure to the sun...eventually we won't be able to go outside at all without something resembling a space suit if we keep up at this rate.  Does all this make me a pessimist? Maybe. It certainly makes me aware. W
