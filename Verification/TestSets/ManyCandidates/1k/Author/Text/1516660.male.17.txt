yoz! i'm back! after one whole week of absence, i'm finally back! man, i miss bloggin....... *starts kissing key board and screen...haha, kidding. i've been kinda busy lately...namely because i've finally started working and bcause of my jie jie's upcoming wedding...wah, u really wun believe wad kinda shit a wedding couple goes through man! though their wedding is like next feb, they're already getting all edgy with the preparations. i'm just the bride's maid man, but i can feel the tension too...woah...its tense i tell you.......the plus point of the whole occasion, for me that is, is that i get to wear this really adorable whole dress...lolx! someone should kick my ass man!   sometimes i really dun get it, weddings are such a big hassle why do people still so eagerly go thru it? i mean, not to say that i'm a big critic or wad but its the truth isn't it? when 2 people love each other, they get married, then they are fufilling God's words but what if they dun? oh, i forgot there is this thingy called divorce nowadays but wun that be breaking God's holy matrimony policy?    "LET NO MAN BREAK WHAT GOD HAS PUT TOGETHER"   in that case, why bother putting it together when u know u might just run the chance of breaking it? if man and woman are made to co-exist, then why do we hear abuse cases every now and then?  *haiz* so many things i dun understand but no one to explain it to me.........maybe i'll jux have to learn it myself.    dear Father in heaven, i pray that as i grow older each day, i will grow wiser too. i pray that i'll grow to be more and more like Jesus, to love and give unconditionally. i pray for the knowledge to understand the ways of this world yet not forget the ways of the kingdom of heaven. i pray for faith and patience to follow in Your ways and not be discouraged and let not my faith in You be waived by the slightest storm.  for all this i pray in Jesus's name, Amen!
People killing People dying Children hurting And women crying Do you practice what you preach  Or do you turn the other check?  From "Where is the love"  yeah, i'm back. i was reading the morning paper a while ago and once again, i was confronted by the ugly truth and yeah, trust me, its ugly. its like, everyday other day i flip the pages of the papers, there is bound to be some bombing or killing somewhere, wassup with people nowadays?? what the hell do you get from killing off fellow beings? don't they feel any pang of guilt or remorse whenever they gun down someone?? its a person for God's sake! don't they feel anything when they see the relatives and close ones cry about their lost?    hey, why dun u put urself in their shoes and think about it??   oh wait, i forgot, sometimes kill for revenge and for their beliefs. what the heck...... i thought Man were all made to be equal, no one's greater than the other. why is it that if even a monker like me can understand that logic, these self proclaimed "Religious Avengers" can't?? what's so difficult to understand? why can't people just be nice to each other for a while?    why can't people just stop and listen to each other? why dun they listen??    wun life be made a lot easier if people listened to each other and talked about their feelings?? its not easy to completely understnad another person's feelings and emotions but if we at least tried then at least it would help right? what's the point in killing and hurtung others just to prove your point or to proclaim urself superior or just hurt others to get revenge?? what's the point in it all?

Feels kinda weird, i mean I'm like so used to that part of me (psst, her name's jade) being around and now that she's off duty, it feels as though a part of me is gone.
