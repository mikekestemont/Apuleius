For those of you who are reading this (in other words, the people who already know everything I'm about to tell you), the next meeting is this Friday, the 25th, at Ashley's house, at 11:30. I'd appreciate people getting the word out to everybody they know.
Okay, please everyone get this out to everyone you can as quickly as possible.  This Friday, the 25th, we (I) are (am) thinking about holding a filming session.  If this works for anyone, please let me know.  If you do not know my number, you can contact Ashley, Tom D, or Ned.  I really need to know if this will work soon, so that I can organize it.  Ashley, can we hold it at you're house?  If not, we can host it at the library/green.  We might be able to host it at my house.  I know for sure that we can host it at my house in the future, but maybe not this Friday.  Please get this out to everyone.  LONG LIVE DEMODOKOS!
Alright, due to the lack of people signing up, I'm going to seriously need anybody who reads this (nobody) to try to get all other members they know to sign up. That way, may this troupe won't completely collapse before it's even taken off.  I'm also thinking that now that school's wrapping up, maybe we should have a meeting sometime soon. Piotr won't be able to make that one, as he's having a merry old romp in Polandland, but assuming other people can make it, we might actually get stuff done. And yes, I promise that this time we'll have actual scripts, though I encourage you people to write some as well, as always.  By the way, Abby, if you're reading this, it might be a good idea for you to set up a new username if your old one is, in fact, wonked out. If you do, I can invite that one into the group.
Okay, a few of you have signed up now (at this count, three), so I'm going to put up the first post with any actual point.  First of all, as you can see, I've given the blog a facelift. Right now, I've just slapped a new template on it, but since I find it difficult to pass up the chance to do some code tinkering, I may customize the look further later on.  Something that you should also note is that only official members of the blog (Demodokos troupe members, in other words) can comment on the posts, as well as, obviously, post stuff in the first place. That's just to keep it less cluttered with other stuff, so we can just talk business here.  We are also now registered under Creative Commons. You can click on the link at the sidebar for the specifics, but basically it means that while people can copy whatever work we post up here, they can't use it commercially without our permission, or alter it in any way, and they must always give us credit for it. Seems reasonable enough to me. Anyways, the point is, that means you can feel free to post a script idea up here, so we can discuss it.  Anyways, down to business. We need a time and date for the next meeting. We also need to know what we're going to do there. First of all, I think it would be good to wrap up the "What to Do and What not to Do During Dating" sketch which we started last time, just with more people. I think we're almost done with that, and we'd have plenty of time for something else after.  So that leaves us with room for another sketch. Personally, I'd like to see the "3 Fast, 3 Furious" idea be used, but as always, this is an open discussion. I'm still writing the script for that, so I may post it up here, or just email it to all of you later.  Actually, come to think of it, while I've got you all here, we can do casting too, so we know who has to show up at what meeting. This will make things a lot easier.  Alright so any scheduling ideas?  UPDATE: By the way, for those of you in the group who don't already know about it, here's  urlLink another group vaguely similar to ours,  that's seems to have had some success. They are what, in part, inspired the idea for this group in the first place. Check them out, if you haven't already.
This is the first post on the official blog of the sketch comedy troupe  Demodokos.  I'm  Demodokos  writer/director/editor/sometimes-actor  urlLink Ned Resnikoff.  Sorry, couldn't resist a little blog-whoring there.  Anyways, for those of you who don't already know, this is a filmed sketch comedy group, with what I think is some really good, really random stuff. We're working on our first show right now, which we're probably going to publically screen somewhere, with a ticket price of two dollars, or something. Anyways, the purpose of this blog is to keep you, the non-member, informed about the creation of this group. It also serves another purpose, which is to work out all the scheduling stuff for the group, so we can hopefully, meet regularly and get this thing done.  If you're a member of the troupe, register on  urlLink Blogger,  then email  urlLink here.  I'll set you up as a member here, so you can post whenever. Don't forget to visit regularly, for scheduling stuff, and just for shooting sketch ideas back and forth. I'm going to get around to copyrighting this blog under Creative Commons eventually, so the sketch ideas we post up here should be safe.
Woohoo, my very own news blog.  . . . just in time to miss the Democratic National Convention. Eh. I'll cover it in four years. In the meantime, there's still plenty of news out there.  Anyways, I'm Ned, and I'll be your blogger for this evening. I'm a writer, and  urlLink here's my website.  I've been itching to start up a n
