I was gonna add some more pictures like Rob's been doing, but for some reason Hello (the program that so conveniently allows me to do that, or at least in theory does) isn't cooperating.  Just imagine some really cool pictures.  Keep rocking and rolling, Rob, I'll catch up sooner or later.

What a play on words. Well, no one gets it.  Here we are. A team. Like Tenacious D or P. Diddy and Mace. It seem like the more dough we make, the more brothers we see. Ain't dat tha trut'. Since we are the greatest lost cause to have ever walked the planet. We speak and no one hears us. We shout and some one says "Did you hear something?" "No" "I thought I heard 'We suck!' Must be hearing things, oh well."  But onward we march, like there's hope, light at the end of the tunnel, some prize at the finish line. But we're lost, hope's lost, we are in the darkest abyss, veering off the track.  Well there is one thing. We have vivid imaginations. And we can pretend very well that there's something worth living for, and it's not just True Love!... ok so the only thing worth living for is true love. but we've got it. we have the love of art and creating, and we both have our own loves. and we both love our wieners.
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the first-ever post of bentwerx@blogspot!  It's not exactly important or anything.  Rob had something really clever to say about it in his own first post, but I forgot it.  It was still really good though.  If we're lucky he'll put it up here.  Everyone begin praying to Rob now.  There's absolutely nothing important to be said here.  We'll just go over the basics for now:   who can comment?  Anyone.  Go ahead and flame us.  We'll flame ya right back, bitch.  why does this site suck already?  If you feel like putting time into it, do so immediately and you won't have to deal with it.  Oh, yeah--you can't.  ...  What?  is... that it?  Yep.  We'll do some more later.  Goodnight everyone.
Michelle is sick. Really sick. I felt so bad when she was crying in History. I wanted to cure her. But it was beyond my control. And now it's gone too far. I'm not even going to see her tomorrow. And i don't know if she'll be better by saturday. Curses, Curse be to the gODS!

A conversation between myself and El Renss. Can you guess who is who? anyways. We are probably the only people that think this is funny. I implore you to waste some time and brain cells: [21:26:05:23:2004] The MASTER: we worked out the system of the yard sale in gloucester [21:26:05:23:2004] The MASTER: it's a self-supporting cottage industry [21:27:05:23:2004] durandal: cottage? cheese? [21:27:05:23:2004] The MASTER: there's these people, see--and this is fact, you'll know when I get to the stuff we deduced [21:27:05:23:2004] The MASTER: forget that part for now [21:27:05:23:2004] The MASTER: anyways [21:27:05:23:2004] The MASTER: these people go around to yard sales, and buy things [21:27:05:23:2004] The MASTER: then they come home, and have a yard sale, and try to sell them [21:27:05:23:2004] The MASTER: BUT [21:28:05:23:2004] The MASTER: in fact most of the yard sales are the same people doing the same things [21:28:05:23:2004] The MASTER: this shirt, that's selling for one dollar [21:28:05:23:2004] The MASTER: one guy will buy it, then he'll sell it and the guy who sold it w
