My last day in this company. I'm feeling a mixture of excitement and sadness realizing that by tomorrow, I will no longer be sitting here. I have grown rather accustomed to my little cubicle. Though I haven't been working here for long, spending an average of 10-12 hours of my day here for the past 2 years somehow left a mark in my life. But Anne told me to cheer up. It's not the company I have a heavy heart of leaving, it's the people. And she's right.  *sigh   They have becomed more than colleagues, they are my frens. I hope I will meet equally nice and fun people in my new company.  I shall leave today's blog with pics of the happier times.    One of our many nights out.    Eric Meric.

Just got off the phone with  him .  Me, "Can you hear me?" Him, " Yes." Me, "Then why are you distracted?" Him, "What do you mean?" Me, "You are taking 5 seconds to answer me." Him, "That's coz I don't want to hear." Me, "Har.har.har. Very funny. Ok fine."  I guess he wasn't very receptive to my suggestion of offering to cut his hair for him since his favourite barber tutup kedai.  The 5 second man. Gentlemen, please don't do it to your ladies. We hate it. Just say no. *wink
"Those who have the courage to love, should have the courage to suffer."   (A. Trollope : The Bertrams)  Everybody rants about love. Today is my turn.  After reading  urlLink Datin's  entry yesterday, I couldn't stop thinking. Her entry said,  "We sat mostly in silence, contemplating our own universal concerns, watching the sky, admiring the new frangipanis in bloom.  I realised then that perhaps the center of my being is pretty happy after all. Not completely, but just enough. Enough to take me through the days and love this man next to me."   It reminds me of this guy I'm seeing right now. I have just met him earlier this year by occasion of work. We talked. We shared a few smoke breaks. We went home. It could have just ended there.  But  no , I sent a thank you note to him - for reasons of work as well. And from there, began a very lovely friendship. And sometimes, not unlike Datin...we also sit in the silence of each other's company, contemplating our own thoughts. Sometimes I am just dying to know what's going on in his mind...but I know better than to ask. Each of us need, at times, those moments of thoughts. Good thoughts. Bad thoughts. Silly thoughts. Nasty thoughts. But just the same - those thoughts we do not wish to explain.  He's older. Much older than me. Except for the moments when we sit in silence, I do not feel the age. He makes me feel safe. Someone who's been there & done that. He encourages me to grow, to do things, to live. This is what I especially like about him. Someone who gives me the space to grow. You don't get that going out with younger guys.  Younger men are still trying to 'make it' for themselves. They are engrossed in trying to make you fit in. They get too territorial and want to control  what  you do. They get insecure and want to control  who  you go out with. Like what gives?  *snort   Right on. I'm getting side tracked from my initial topic. So, what's all the big fuss about love?  If you asked  ME , I'd say it's distorted from all the bloody fairy tales and soppy movies you watched all your life. 'Girl gets into trouble, boy rescues girl, I love you and live happily everafter.' Or vice versa. (*just to be a little politically correct)  I grew up in an environment where there are more broken marriages than broken china. I have seen happy marriages, loving couples with great kids...and the next thing you know, the husband tries to hit on me. And mind you, he was sober. What the fcuk? What is then the meaning of love? What is love when your husband tells you I love you, pays all the bills in the household, comes home every night for dinner, plays with the kids, makes love to you at night, gets along with your mother and fcuks another woman occasionally. Is that ONE flaw big enough for you to leave him, or small enough to be contra off for all his other qualities?  Love, I believe is always conditional. Women who believe that love is unconditional are either lying to themselves, or being lied to by their partners.  There is only one unconditional love I have and that is for my immediate family. Everything else is conditional.  I think I have lost faith in love. But like what Ally (in Ally McBeal) said to her therapist in one of the episodes.....she doesn't believe in love anymore, but she can't help wanting desperately to be loved. Perhaps my fear is more of ending up with a bastard. I've seen too many of these slimeballs around. I don't need excess baggages in my life.  Like what I told Datin, we can only be happy for the moment. Everything else is beyond our control.  So for the moment, I am happy.  Not completely, but just enough.
This poem by Glen Allen reflects exactly who I have becomed throughout the years, moulded by what I have been through and what I have seen happening around me.   The Woman I Am   ~ Glen Allen  "The woman I am hides deep in me beneath the woman I seem to be.  She hides away from the stranger's eye -  she is not known to the passer-by. she goes her way, the woman I seem,  But the woman I am withdraws to dream! The woman I seem goes carelessly - when love goes by does not seem to see.  But the woman I am knows sudden fear... and hides more deeply when l
