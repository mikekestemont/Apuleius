urlLink     Sounds of Summer Drum Corps Competition Scores   Kelso, WA: June 28, 2004
WARNING!!! - This post contains explicit content and is intended only for the hard core band nerd.   Yesterday evening, I drove up to Kelso to watch the  Sounds of Summer  Drum Corps competition. It was pretty amazing... The Division 1 corps were especially phenomenal. The Blue Devils and Santa Clara Vanguard were flawless and played so loud it made your ears burn. Those two corps are very entertaining to see and I highly recommend everyone to go watch them if their tours bring them to your neck of the woods this summer. The Mandarins are Chinese themed, with complementing uniforms and guard, making them look like a bunch of warriors in a Chinese army from centuries ago. They too were awesome and I enjoyed the different style. The Oregon Crusaders have much improved since I last watched them at PGE Park in Portland a few weeks ago. I know a lot of the members in OC since most of them come from Skyview HS. I was definetly pleased with their performance and got to talk with some of my friends who are on tour with OC. The Spokane Thunder were on the verge of terrible... many problems in many categories. But they are a first year corps... maybe a little forgiveness for them? All-around, the show was spectacular and definitely worth the hour drive and $22 ticket price.
You know what I did all day... ? ... I watched my little 1 yr old brother. Yep... that's the extent of it. I never mind,  though. Connor is not one of those noisy babies that cry all the time, no he is quiet mostly. Except for when he is hungry, overly bored/tired, or smacks himself against something. Yes, this kid is great at beating himself up; you know how it is... walking babies are a wreck waiting to happen. Once they think they have got the hang of it, they confidently run around in what appears to be a drunken stupor... wobbling  about with a constant lack of balance. Eventually, they are bound to smack right into a wall or completely lose balance and fall onto something one would not want to drop all of their weight on to. Just today... Connor is busy jogging about with no particualur aim or destination in mind, and BAM!!! right into the dresser. Not only that, but he then swings around and smacks himself into the a wooden bunk bed frame just three feet away. Its almost humorous to watch him bouncing himself off of bedroom accessories like a pinball in a  Furniture Land  pinball machine. This is common occurance for him; he quickly recovers and is off again looking for further ways to inflict personal injury.
Hello all dedicated readers...   (yeah, I wish)  My emotions seem to be balancing out to a neutral state. I am so glad that school is out (the endless projects and finals burned me out)... but my gorgeous girlfriend of eight months, whom I will further refer to as Megan, is going to San Bernardino, CA to see her dad and other people associated with that side of her family... it's great that she is going to visit her dad, whom she only sees twice a year... but she is going to be gone all summer and I am going to miss her oh-so terribly. Summer is the best time to spend time with your girlfriend... and she is going to be gone. I love her and will stay with her (long-distance relationship, oh-yay), fidelity and all, until she returns in the fall... (no interesting camping experiences this year). Not only is Megan gone... but most of my friends... many of whom are dedicated band nerds... are on tour with assorted drum and bugle corps (all summer). So now I gotta go dig out the old pile of people's numbers (most are chicken-scratched on random papers), and see if I can get together with old friends whom I un-intentionally stopped communicating with after band-nerdism took over. I should tell the population of  dedicated readers  out there that I am a trumpet player (for ~ 7 years now). I will most probably be getting together with an old friend whom I went on a couple of dates with last summer (yes, a girl)... maybe help her with showing her 4-H pigs at the county fair... we are decidedly just friends, of course. Now that it's summer... I have no friends... I am a bored nerd... I will be posting more of these blog thingies to keep the  dedicated readers  out there busy.
I really want a GMail account... if someone gets multiple invites please email me a link. Now I must return to writing my History and English essays which are due tommorrow.
I have been having lots of fun. Today, Tom and I went to the Portland Red Bull Flugtag...  urlLink click here . It was right on the waterfront, close to where the Saturday Market is held. I have never had so much fun in my life. The Flugtag is an event where teams make contraptions and attempt to fly them off of a really tall ramp/barge into the river (in this case, the Williamate). The winners were decided on who had the most style and/or flied the farthest by a panel of judges consisting of pro extreme sports and local radio station personalities. The top prize was $7500 cold hard cash but it was mostly really absurdly silly and brilliantly stupid (oxymoron?) and the teams seemed to be more interested in having fun than getting any prizes. They had some really cool looking flyers but few actually did any flying... the farthest flight was 40 feet and most just dropped like a rock. Its actually really fun watching an elaborate, heavy contraption drop with a satisfying, shattering smack with pilot inside. We were right on the beach and about 30 feet from the actual flights. There were oodles of people watching, lotsa media coverage, and enough yaghts/random boats c
