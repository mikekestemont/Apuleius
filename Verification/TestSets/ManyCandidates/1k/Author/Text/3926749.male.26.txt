Hey, ever had one of those moments where you're just stunned into silence, trying to absorb what just happened or what someone just said to you? I just did....  Wow....  I think I'm getting a headache...  Need to relax...  Relax....
&nbsp; I find myself getting more involved with other peoples blogs. There are currently 2 blogs i take an active interest in. One's funny yet dramatic, the other's full of self searching. What's mine? Well, judging from previous posts, it appears that I seem to have too much gaming in my head!  Maybe I should cut down on the gaming posting and concentrate on my personal self. I guess maybe I haven't gotten to that stage yet. Here's a go:  I find Decision-making that affects my personal life is usually one of the hardest things to do. Why do I constantly attempt to pursue that which others believe to be impossible? Am I looking for drama to spice up my life? That's what comes when one reads too much or watches too many movies full of ideals, romanticism and hopes. Why can I not accept the norm, or go for that which is a safe decision? I cannot answer this, but I do know I cannot!  I will try...&nbsp; and I can only hope that the other will attempt the same...  Till then...
Well, it's Wednesday today, 5 days since my last posting and 3 days since the Magic GP ended. I finished day 1 at 4-3, losing my last two matches rather pathetically to U-W Control, which was arguably my worst matchup, but still....  I didn't realise that I would be as depressed as I was at the end of the day, but I guess it was more to the fact that I was 4-1 at one point. I suppose if I had started the day at 1-3, I wouldn't be that disappointed to the extent that I may have been an asshole at the end of the day and I do apologise to my supporters for that.   In any case, I am truly grateful to one overseas supporter, for providing some great motivation via SMS. Fina, you were fantastic throughout even though you weren't sure exactly how it all works. It would have been great having you around here in person...  Anyway, I woke up on Sunday feeling much better and proceeded to plow through 3 drafts, losing at semis, and two finals respectively. Right now I'm actually waiting to see my updated ratings. By default I should have higher ones, especially considering my current ratings :)  Sunday night, Hafiz, my Magic General&nbsp; Manager gave me a slow-talk over dinner to not quit Magic, among other things. I actually seriously wanted to quit, but I wanted to actually achieve something for the GP, something I haven't done. I guess maybe I'll still play, just not as frequent.  Enough of Magic, onto WRESTLING STEEL CAGE coming up this Sunday!!!  &nbsp;
Two days away and we're barely prepared!&nbsp; Not to mention the fact that one of us, Azmady won't be coming as he's flying off to some other country for work.  What's for sure is that we're coming in to the tournament with half of us packing Land D decks. Despite the fact that Gabriel Nassif finished 2nd with his Land D deck at his French Nationals, we are of the opinion it's still very viable. We just need to be prepared to counter the hate available. Oh, Sacred Ground, how I hate thee...  As for freaking COP: Red: I have&nbsp; one maindeck solution, but uncertain if it should stay maindeck now. Those hasty golems keep coming back into my head, I might seriously consider sideboarding it instead.   Hafiz has an entirely different strategy, if Sacred Ground comes out, what to do....  I doubt I'll be blogging this weekend. Should be too busy. Hopefully I'll get back on Sunday night with wonderful news (then again, if I have wonderful news, I'll probably be out partying :) )  &nbsp;
&nbsp; Yes. No doubt about it now. Am I falling for her? One can never be absolutely sure. I've always told others that starting a relationship is taking a leap of faith. You will NEVER know FOR SURE.  And yet, we seem to be able to get along well. Of course, it could be due to stuff we have in common. Only time will tell...   Who is she? Maybe later, when I've worked up the GUTS to write her name. For now, it will reside in my heart, where it will be safe...  Ha ha reminded me of a Malay phrase, Makan tak Kenyang, Tidur tak Lena, meaning 'eating doesn't satisfy my hunger, and I can't sleep'.  Oh well, ****, till I meet you again...
&nbsp; All this Steel Cage testing and I completely neglected to do some work for the Magic GP tournament this Sunday! Issue now is figuring out what to play after Hafiz brought a Land D deck to the Semi-Finals of one of the GP trials, putting Land D on the map. If 50% of the players turn up with U-W Control I'm doomed. Still no real solution for that, Culling Scales just doesn't cut it. &nbsp; Fina was mentioning that I ought to put my poetry in this blog, which is&nbsp;a good idea really. Hmm, I wonder if it's possible to create a separate page where I can just display poetry, like a homepage, instead of a normal posting. Possibilities.... &nbsp; I can't be bothered changing the date at the bottom anymore, even though it's not accurate in Malaysia. It's only one day. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;
After continuous procrastination, I've finally managed to get down to constructing a deck for the Steel Cage tournament, i.e. Eric Bischoff. My constant reluctance to dismantle my Trish has resulted in me having to write down my ideas on paper, which does look easier once I've done it. Hopefully tonight I'll get to do some rough testing.  Note: Any reader who has stumbled upon this blog may have no idea what I'm talking about. Well, h
