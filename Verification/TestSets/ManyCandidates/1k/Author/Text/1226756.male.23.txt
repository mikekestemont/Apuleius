OK...  Another day, another dollar. I didn't get to do much last night, because I was just so exhausted.. But, today is friday, so there will be some time free this weekend. In all likelyhood, there will be a party tonight, but that's allright. (Partying with friends is a portion of life. There will not be a post on my blog until monday at the earliest. If someone who reads this blog would like schematics or code I have written, feel free to contact me at: diskfly@online.no
Well, last night I did infact make the PIC-Chip write "Hello World." on a 2x24 LCD display. (The display is controlled by the chip HD44780A00.) Since I have made this, it seems only natural to incorporate this into another project. I think I will make an alarm, or something like that. I will also be making a small robot (read this : RoBUG). It will be self-powered, and search out light and avoid obstacles. This is a project lying quite a bit into the future, but I will make it. The JAL language is the best thing that has happened to me since I discovered the TurboPascal language. Now I can write my own stuff for the PIC, instead of building projects already made by others. I believe I will be starting the alarm tonight, and working on it during the weekend. I will also document the project with schematics, code and pictures. I don't have a homepage for electronics yet, but this will be up and running at a later time. The address to my site will be posted here on my BLOG.
I thought I might as well try this Blogging phenomenon myself. Read about it all over the Internet and thought why not... I will post info on what I'm doing with the PIC-Micro and JAL here. My latest project was interfacing the PIC16F84 with a 7-segment LED (the type that can display numbers.) Counting down from 5..0 and then holding the 0 for another 5 seconds, then starting the whole procedure again. Today I will start my next project, which will be to interface the 16F84 with a 40character -/ 2lines LCD display. I don't believe this will be a problem, but somehow I never know these things.  Geir
OK. So it's been over a year since my last post. To be honest, I had forgotten about this site, but now i'm writing again. I haven't had time to work on electronics or robotics lately, but I got the spark back a few nights ago. I have to teach myself everything all over again, but that'll just have to be OK. I will concentrate on electronics and robotics from now on, because I find that to be more interesting. My first attempt will be a WireRunner, adapted from one I found at Wouter van Ooijen's site.  urlLink (http://www.voti.nl/wire/index.html)  There will be some changes made to it, and I will document it all and post it on my website. (Not up and running for electronics yet.) On another note, I seem to remember the use of quite large capacitors in BEAM roborics. Most importantly in photo-poppers. 2200uF and 3300uF. I found a good and cheap source for these caps, and that is inside the powersupply of a normal computer. I collected 4 or 5 from an old powersupply I had lying around. I haven't made the RoBUG that searches for light yet, but when I feel comfortable with electronics again, I might give it a try. Hopefully it won't be over a year until my next post, but a couple of days. Friday's here, and a party I feel is the right thing this weekend.
Haven't written for a couple of days now. Been far to busy doing other things. Components is a nightmare to get hold of when you're a person, not a company. I have a company but that doesn't deal in electronics, so I'm not using that. I get so frustrated waiting to get the price of some components that's no listed in the normal pricelist. Guess I'll have to use used parts. I've learnt about BEAM, and thought I'd give that a try, because that's just a couple of inverters, transistors, resistors and some caps. I wonder what made Mark Tilden think of this in the first place. Friday today, and I'm not quite sure what the night will escalate to. A few beers with some friends, and maybe a trip to the golfcourse. Spent 4 hours there last night. Didn't leave until 12:15am. Getting up at 7:30am to go to work, wasn't a joy. Maybe see what I can get a hold of in used appliances, and take off some components. Need a walkman, or a small tape-player, because the motors in those are better than the ones I got now. I'll have to check a local "used things" store. There's a fleamarket tomorrow, maybe I'll find something there. I found the schematics for an EdgeBOT, I don't have a link right here, and I don't remember the name of the author. Perhaps I'll try to build that during the weekend. We'll see.
Ozkal answered me and the public today, in the forums at his robotics site. The idea was to play around with the resistor values on the base pin of the transistors. Being careful not to drop below 330Ohm, which would increase the use of voltage. Didn't get any testing done yesterday, because I spent two hours in the kitchen making dinner, and after that I went to the driving range of our golfcourt to hit a few buckets. It good to get some frustration out by hitting a golfball and see it fly 250++ meters. Another soulution to my SimpleBUG problem would be to use gearing, but that's alot of fitting problems, so servo motors would be a good idea. I just checked the lead supplier of model parts around, and one servo costs 114NOK. (That's over $17 USD.) Might have to see if I can find a source for used parts. That's not very easy here i
