Hi Mom!  She is most likely the only person who will ever read this, but I figured this is a good way for you to keep up with what I'm up to.  I'll try to update it every day.  It might be tough, you know, since I'm sooooo busy every day.  I'm watching the Olympics right now, it's just past 10pm here on Saturday night.  Actually, I'm watching the local news, the Olympics just finished for the evening.  I watched some football for the first time today, and even though it was preseason and it wasn't the Packers, it was good to see football again.  I need something to watch and follow since the Brewers suck again.  I knew that would happen sooner or later.  I play EQ with Tony just about every day.  There are days where we go out on the town, so I don't talk to him every day.  I miss him a lot, although I don't think he thinks so.  I miss all of you (my family) too.  Matt isn't sure when his boat is going out now, but I will be home in October, anyway.  I really miss my cats and I'm looking forward to picking them up.  Matt and I are doing very well, I find myself in love with him more and more every day.  He is the sweetest person I've ever known.  He makes me realize every day that I am the most important person in his life.  He's still working nights.  We went to a concert last night, Blink 182.  It was pretty cool (but the crowd was very loud, 20,000+ teenage girls will do that.)  Well, I'm going to go and see if I can get this to actually post on my web site.  I'm going to try to come up with a home page design and put up some pictures.  I lost all of my previous content, which isn't a huge loss since t needed a lot of work, anyway.  Later!
I ordered a double dresser, a 5-drawer upright dresser, and a night stand yesterday from a local online furniture store.  I got it this morning.  The store manager emailed me almost immediately, I called him this morning, and I had the furniture by noon.  Wow.  Anyway, the bedroom looks so much more clean now that clothes aren't in piles on the floor.  I have decided to spend a little bit of money on a new violin.  I am confident in my ability to recognize a good violin by sight (it's all in the back of the violin) so I placed a bid on one on Ebay.  Hopefully by tomorrow night I will be the owner of a brand new single-back violin in a beautiful leather case.  Mom, if you could, could you mail me my violin music?  :)  I also want to buy a bass guitar, because I think my violin experience would make me pretty good at it.  Besides, I tried 6-string and suck due to chords.  We ate at Chili's tonight, which was a nice change.  I haven't been feeling so great all day, though, and I am going to go to bed as soon as I'm done writing this.  I haven't watched the Olympics much today, but I did watch for a bit early this morning.  I really don't have a rant, but I do have another humorous observation.  There always seems to be at least one smart announcer and one not smart one.  Often times I am noticing the dumb one saying things like "That was good, right?"  The stupid moment of today has been the best of the Olympics so far.  It was during the Russia vs US water polo game, and the smart announcer was talking about how the Russia team has traveled all continents, as long as you don't count Antarctica and "Arctica."  I am not kidding.  LOL He quickly turned into the dumb announcer in my book.
I'm noticing another trend as I watch the Olympics - a lot of the athletes from other countries are either US born or they attend school in the US. Now, if you were born in another country and attend college in the US, I can understand that you would want to play for your native country. However, if you are US born and raised, but you have some ancestry in another country, I'm not sure that qualifies you in my book to represent that country in the Olympics.  Example: I was watching the US vs Greek softball game the other night (the former Brewers TV announcer is commentating) and he stated that at least 75% of the Greek softball team is American born and raised. This just doesn't seem right to me. Another example: the old Jamaican woman that didn't make the Jamaican team was running for Slovenia.  So is this like pro sports now, where players are traded and have the liberty of playing for whatever country they want?  That's my rant for the day.  Mom, say 'hi' to everyone at Jeff and Linda's party for me.  You know how much I enjoyed going to those family functions, but I almost wish that I could go now.  I was excited to hear that you and Dad are going to Arizona for your anniversary.  I am looking forward to living there someday, and it would be awesome if you and Dad lived there, too.  :)
I am learning how to cook!  Matt and I actually go grocery shopping, I plan our meals roughly a month ahead of time, I buy all the ingredients I need, and I actually stick to it.  It is not an easy task, though.  I bought a cookbook and I'm starting to learn that straying from the directions can make for some interesting concoctions.  Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't.  Tonight I cooked meatloaf.  We didn't have any basil so I used oregeno.  We didn't have any bread crumbs, so I used crushed pretzels.  Etc etc.  It sure didn't turn out like Mom used to make, but it was edible.  There hasn't b
