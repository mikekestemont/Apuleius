ANNOUNCEMENT   Good and attentive CPW readers!  Mission accomplished.  I have had my fun with Berkeley's forever-just-fledgling conservative community and their treasured rag.  But it is time to move on to bigger, much better things.  I am ditching this narrowly-focused California Patriot Watch blog, in favor of a broader, all-purpose blog instead.  If the  Patriot  ever updates their site (never certain), I might just see the need to critique aspects of it from my new blog.  Plus, my impending departure to Santa Barbara makes me a lot more likely to deal with local issues there rather than here.  Oh, and what's the new blog gonna be?  It's called:   urlLink The Facts Machine   (http://factsmachine.blogspot.com)  Check it out!  Thanks!  Go Bears!  Go Gauchos!  Go Everybody!
PATRIOT  HILARITY ON SIMON, DAVIS   Looking at Mr. Ratliff's piece on  urlLink Bill Simon and Gray Davis , a couple of sentences jumped out at me:   Therefore, Davis has sought to raise as much money as possible to viciously attack anyone that opposes him...    This was evident when Davis spent an unprecedented $10 million dollars assailing the centrist Richard Riordan during the Republican Primary- a race the democrat Davis should not have been involved with at all.   Second part first...   So Davis shouldn't have been running ads against his potential Republican opponents during primary season, that's an arguable ethical point that could go either way, fair enough.  But gee golly, such a strategy is good enough for Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who attacked Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Bill McBride in TV ads during the primary season there.  If it's good enough for the Jebster, why not Gray?  Hey  Patriot , contact the folks at the "Seminole Review" or the "Hurricane Patriot" or something and tell them to denounce Jeb for using the exact same tactics.  Now the first part...  Political Novice Alert!... The two sentences directly contradict eachother!  Riordan is described by Ratliff as a "centrist", as opposed to the conservative Simon.  Davis spent money to attack the candidate who opposed him LESS.  Allow me to clue Ratliff in.   The name of the game here, as any wise observer would know, is that both Davis and Jeb Bush attempted to pick their opponents for the general election .  Davis wanted to pick off Riordan so he could face a "garden-variety conservative", Simon, in November.  Jeb Bush, down in the Sunshine State, wanted to attack Bill McBride (who has bested Bush in some head-to-head polls in recent weeks/months) so he could face former Attorney General Janet Reno who, while a worthy candidate, has a lot of baggage (not all of which is her fault).   The thing is, Republicans in California and Democrats in Florida should both be able to see through this sort of cynical nonsense.   They should deduce that the sitting governors are attacking certain candidates because those candidates pose the largest threat to defeat them.  Did Florida Dems do this?  Yes, they saw through it (with the help of some effective McBride ads bringing all this up), and nominated Bill McBride to go up against Jeb in what looks like an exciting, to-the-wire race.  On the other hand, did California Republicans do this?  Well no, they listened to Davis' ads, and nominated Bill Simon, even though Riordan was Dubya's hand-picked, blessed candidate, as well as a proactive, popular mayor in Los Angeles.   This proves, if anything at all, that Florida Democrats are smarter than California Republicans!  Put that in your butterfly ballot and smoke it! (:   p.s. Congratulations to "successful businessman" Bill Simon for finding a conservative lackey judge to toss out the fraud conviction.  Hey Bill, maybe you and I can move in together and be domestic partners!
From the AP wire:   urlLink Jewish settlers suspected of bombing Palestinian school   But of course, this was just a few extremists, not indicative of the whole, and this sort of thing is bound to happen amid such conflict and desperation... Hmm that's a rationale I've heard before...
PATRIOT , MEET JOE MCCARTHY   Freedom of speech, it's a bitch, isn't it?  The truth is,  Patriot , that if you really want to celebrate American values, and if you really want to exude true patriotism, then you, my friends, need to celebrate every single word said by those with whom you disagree, whether it be Shingavi or anyone else.  Unfortunately, the Patriot's " urlLink news analysis " of the 9/11 events shows us, on their part, a level of tolerance of dissent that rivals the Ayatollah (one of Ronald Reagan's favorite business partners).  One line that had me dusting off my makeup kit to bust out my Khmer Rouge:   ...the term 'student voices' does, in no way, encourage, necessitate, or justify the eruption of politically charged speeches or  dissident behavior  which occurred. (italics Brendan's)   Did I just read the phrase 'dissident behavior'?  Next thing you know, the  Patriot  is going to publish a list of names.  Eight years of conservatives trying not only to blame President William Jefferson Clinton for any and every problem on the globe, but also to relentlessly assault Clinton with baseless accusations about his personal and professional life, and suddenly criticizing Bush is considered 'dissident behavior'?  The  Patriot  either has an incredibly short memory or an incredibly large pair of cojones.  I'm starting to see what looks like a childish obsession that the  Patriot  has with Snehal Shingavi.  Because they're such an immature and uninformed publication, the boys and girls at the  Patriot  know that the only fight they could possibly, possibly win, as conservatives, is against the most extreme elements of the Berkeley left that there are.  Snehal was right about the 12th being a day of war rhetoric from Dubya.  However, he didn't even have to wait that long.  Bush's speech at Ellis Island on the night of the 11th was a somber requiem for about 90 seconds, and then suddenly veered into very thinly-veiled words of war on Iraq.  Just a couple days after the Administration admitted that there is no link between Hussein and Al Qaeda, Bush had them joined at the hip in his speech.  I
