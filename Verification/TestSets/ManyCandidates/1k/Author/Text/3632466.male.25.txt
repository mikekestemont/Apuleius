friday night with the a-s-s crew.  wandered out to slurrey to drive through scary neighbourhoods and quench ai's thirst.  of course the night could not have ended without a visit to "homecourt" at kensington (is that where that is?).  before arriving, some drunk vina kid cuts his thumb on a empty beer can, he ends up getting lined up the most.  i can now keep the ball at an acceptable height level on the free kicks.  saturday morning poker tournament in ditchmond.  the tourney started at noon, so i figured that would give me enough time to win it all and make it to erica's birthday dinner at skybar at 7pm.  4:45pm, guess who's the chip leader going into the final table, plenty of time to make it to dinner.  get knocked out in 6th place, two spots shy of making any money.  check the watch, 7:10pm!  ai calls, "where are you, i'm here already!!!"  gggggggggg gun-it home, shower, and i'm at skybar at 8:15pm.  little boozin', little schmoozin'.  got drunk bien's shirt-off without waking him up.     now it's time to go home.  drive ai and her car home.  drive all the way back to downtown to pick up my car.  yesterday, watched the thoccer game and some nascar action, then had an impromptu bbq at ryan&joy's place with sof and ai.  good food, good company.  no weak end.
why do i play when i'm just gonna get lined up?  probably 'cuz i'm a sucker for competition, and i'm not one to back down from any challenge.  although i'm usually lined up more than anyone else, i live for when it isn't me up against the fence.  seeing pain and anguish in my friends' faces is priceless.  i know i could easily just punch them in the face or something, but where's the fun in that?
i have to check the  urlLink results  every 30 minutes 'cuz i still can't believe it...  daca, i hate agreeing with you, but you're right.  just imagine what this accomplishment means to some of us that have been doing this now for sooo long!  this isn't just an achievement for all the hard work this years team has put in, this is for all the other ruckers that have paddled somewhere along the way with us.  i wish there was a way that i could thank everyone that ever paddled for ruckus without coming across as an ass that's just trying to rub it in.
silver medal in the rec A championships!!!     i still can't believe it.
guess who's going???  that's right, mother ruckus.
so i'm guessing a fat steak wouldn't be good for the team dinner, huh?  i was asked by kaz and ai to help think of encouraging remarks for every individual on the team, a way of thanking everyone for their own specific contributions.  i started off thinking about the members that actually contributed something and wrote uplifting remarks for them.  but then i got to indivduals that didn't really contribute anything to the team.  in fact, for some members i questioned why they were even on the team!  instead of positive remarks, i was serving straight disses.  which leads me to this... am i really that big of an asshole?  i've always considered myself to be an ass, but damn, sometimes i can be straight-up mean.  but isn't it justifiable?  i'd never be an ass to someone who didn't deserve it.  discuss.
ballin' at the cage, followed by some glutony in the form of richmond sushi.  that is all i will write for today.
i can't tell if i have a cold or my allergies are acting up.  so i'm od'ing on both claritin and dimetapp.
do you ever get the feeling that "big brother" is watching you at work?  every now and then i do, so i test it out just to make sure he isn't.  some of the tests i've pulled in the past are the  sleeping at my desk  test, or the  sleeping under my desk  test.  both proved that on those particular days, "big brother" didn't have a clue!  there's also the  go for a quick rip up to squamish  test (only when jeanne drove the m3 or the 911), or the  shopping at park royal  test.  today i'm gonna do a tried, tested and true version, the  surf-all-day  test, but to spice it up a little i'm adding the  feet on the desk  test.  my job's okay.
ever drink so much you don't remember certain time frames?  i remember all the crown shots.  i remember telling kaz i'd find another ride home.  i remember opening the door at the burger king drive-thru.  then i remember kaz calling and waking me up to go play golf.  friday night was fun.
i was wandering the web earlier and came across some done up vans in ha-pan.&nbsp; the vans are owned by fans of hamasaki ayumi (some singer bitch).&nbsp; click  urlLink here  to see them...   if you make your way down the page, the guy who posted the pics does a quick write-up about the singer...     &nbsp;    ahhhhhhhhahahahaha!!! and this...     &nbsp;  jap's amuse me.
&nbsp;
don't you love it when a joke works perfectly?&nbsp; and then, you're still able to carry it on for a couple of days???&nbsp; that's the best!!!   jeff free, stephen nguyen, clark gable, barry bunds, longranger,&nbsp;kristie c., sakura77, ginzaboy, mattrix, touchyfeely, softee, i am gaynadian., bryson, garreth, brent, kazimodo... what do they all have in common?&nbsp; all created by yours truly.   i'm the best.   taken from  urlLink www.dacango.blogspot.com ...    &nbsp;&nbsp;
i can now lift my arms way up high, but my arms still take time to bend at the elbow.&nbsp; so the shoulders and the chest are good, but the arms still burn.
mi-mommy's funny, she asks me for my permission to play mj with her friends.  &nbsp; when i say no, she says, "please, 'Co?" &nbsp; keekeekee
you'll be back to normal IN no time VAL!&nbsp; take cared kID.  &nbsp;     &nbsp;   &nbsp;
what better way to spend a saturday night than a trip to night market...  &nbsp;  first of all, i'm really trying not to be racist (seriously), but w
