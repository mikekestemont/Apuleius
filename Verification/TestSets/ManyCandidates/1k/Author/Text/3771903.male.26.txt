So I've spent the past two hours driving in a big fat circle trying to find the addresse of a golf course that was given to me by the city manager.  Until now, I hadn't realized that this man must've just set down the crack pipe when I called becasue the addresse he gave me is nowhere near where this golf course actually is.  Now, if he doesn't take this serisouly and for that matter doesn't even know his town, then why should I?  Why have I been out taping for 4 hours?  Why was I up at the ass-crack of dawn to drive an hour and a half then fly for 4 with the lovely pleasure of rounding it all off by sitting in gridlcok traffic for 2 hours.  All just to get to a town that doesn't even give a rats ass that I'm here.  At least I got to sit on the banks of Lake Michigan and take in the sights of morbidly obese women thinking that they're attractive.  On the up side I got to have a real Chicago Hot Dog, but the sight of the fatties almsot made me throw it back up.  Hell, prolly would've been the best thing the 'gulls have eaten all month.  Now I'm off to go find something to do to keep me out of my hotel as much as possible.  Maybe I'll get my hair cut... maybe I'll go on that killing spree I've wanted so much.  Maybe I'll go cruise around downtown Chicago.  I'll prolly just beat my head into a concrete wall though- it's cheaper and offers all the same exciting thrills.
So, I've had (guesstimating) 10 shots of my Crown Royal.    I hear stories all the time from people... "OH MY GOD!  I was out last night and had, like, 8 shots and I was so wasted that I did things I never thousght I'd do"   Hell, I've heard them say stuff about 5 or 6.   It's making me wonder...  is somehting wrong with me, or is something wrong with them?  then I think back to wed and I know that there's something wrong with me.  Now, I can point the finger in a million and one directions- work, stress, inability to be able to relax since the only real time I get to sit down & REALLY relax is twice a week (1 night this week).  But those are excuses.  I am really beginning to think I have a problem.  Not so much with alcohol, but with "cruches".  Just, something to help me be able to relax.  I'm looking at my calander on my wall... not a single week without a cruch, ever.  Am I this weak?    It's 12:30 and I have to be on the road in 5 hours to catch my flight out of Buffalo.  I'm cruising around Illinois this week.  I have 13 hour days in front of me so I can't say I'll touch this for the week.  we'll see...
Contempt and hatred for most that exists courses through my veins as I emptied another glass. I hate Birmingham MI. Overpriced, watered down drinks with a holier-than-thou attitude. I fucking hate it. DeVinci wasn't as good a painter as most of these women, and the flesh tone cake must be the 'in' thing right now. If I saw another guy flash a marble smile I think I'm gonna head-butt them, or at the very least run my hand through their skull and rip out some brain.  I don't know where this anger comes from. A fire hydrant of hatred that just can not be shut off. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that I hadn't spent more than 15 hours at my own house in three weeks. Maybe it was because I was in Detroit again, and I hate Detroit.  Whatever it was, I wanted to fight.  I wanted to bleed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mall is ugly. All malls are ugly. Big-fat-nothing functional rectangles. This one’s huge, four stories. For my birthday, we’re going to see a movie. This is nostalgic, because that used to be my birthday wish every year, growing up. That’s all I ever wanted: a movie. I used to get all tingly in my fingers and toes, butterflies in my stomach, adrenaline in my veins. Every new story used to do that to me.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish I could pinpoint when that stopped happening, so I could undo whatever it was that changed.        ~Chad T.

I took a sip of my drink, smiling at the fact that my 8 day sober streak was ending.&nbsp; I gazed at the faces around me, all friends of the bartender, and all speaking Russian.&nbsp; They would laugh at a joke and I would fake a smile as if I actually knew what the hell they just said.&nbsp; The bartender was nice enough to translate the joke for me- it wasn't that funny, so I popped on that fake smile again.   3 drinks later the bartender goes over to the piano and starts playing.&nbsp; The ivories sang a song unlike anything I had heard before, and when his friend started singing I fought back a tear.&nbsp; it was astounding, this music, so beautiful, so alive and sad, and I couldn't understand a word of it and it didn't matter.&nbsp; Music is universal and the cosmos of this bar was my home.  Two songs later it was time for a refill.&nbsp; The bartender busy, the owner came over and made my drink.&nbsp; 3/4 beam, 1/4 Coke, just the way I like it.&nbsp; He held the drink dispenser in front of me, "This is the button for the Coke, got it?"&nbsp; He says to me as he set the bottle of Jim Beam in front of me.&nbsp; I nodded, he walked away, and I got shit-faced like I haven't been in a long time- well, at least 8 days.   The bartender played music.&nbsp; His friend sang.&nbsp; I sat their in drunken delight.&nbsp;   I&nbsp;don't remember finishing the bottle.   When the morning broke I found myself on t
