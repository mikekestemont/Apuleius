After the argument with my father about buying my townhouse, I had a pretty good Saturday.  My friend Ken from high school (I also went to college with him) called to tell me that they were going out, and asked me if I wanted to come along.  His roommate from college, Jackson, was coming down, and I had a crush on Jackson in college.  The guy looks like a skinner version of Jake Gyllenhaal... but with a unibrow.  But, strangely, the unibrow is sexy.  I don't know if Jackson knew that I had the hots for him or not, but we had some sort of "connection."  He got too drunk for me to act on it, but I think I ruined it anyway.  Jackson and Ken's friends Jamie and Tony were out with us also.  It was basically me and 6 guys.  It was fun... I just watched them get totally wasted.  Me and Tony started talking and when he found out I used to be married, he automatically deemed me "sexy" and "naughty."  Interesting.  I ended up hooking up with Tony later that night, as well as Jamie.  That's where the "ruining" part came in.  I probably could have hooked up with Jackson, and initially I really wanted to, but I figured I ruined it and didn't want to seem like the group blow-up doll.  Anyway, I would have gotten too hopeful in spite of the fact that Jackson is working the Warped Tour and won't be around all summer.  I'm sure I'll see him again, but I'll probably feel awkward.  Hopefully he'll forget it all.  I really want to see Shawn.  I wish I could talk to him more.  Sometimes I feel weird hooking up with other guys, even though there is absolutely NOTHING going on with the two of us.  I feel like I'm letting him down somehow.  I probably shouldn't feel that way.  Matt hasn't called me, thank God.  I guess he got the picture after our weird night together.  Anyway, gotta go...  Any thoughts on Bush's address tonight??  Not that anyone reads this or would like to comment...
So my landlord calls this morning to say that she wants to sell the house.  But she wants to see if I want to buy it first.  OF COURSE I DO!  I am so tired of paying rent it's not even funny.  I'm so excited I could pee.  Then I call my parents to tell them the good news.  What does my dad say?  "No.  You're not doing it."  Hello?  I didn't call to ask your permission, I called to tell you the good news.  Then he starts ranting and raving about how I'm not divorced yet and if I buy the house before I'm divorced Pat will go after it and take half of the house.  I tried reasoning with him and saying that I highly doubted that, that I don't really talk to Pat, and that he doesn't have to know that I was buying it.  Of course, my father didn't want to hear it.  He was screaming over me.  He actually said, "I will not allow you to buy that house before you are divorced."  Oh really, Dad?  You're not going to let me?  I'd like to see you try.  Besides, my divorce hearing is on June 15th.  It's not like everything would happen before then.  Get real.  What gets me is that even though I'll be 25 in July, my parents still insist on pulling this garbage.  I wouldn't be surprised if they tried to ground me one day.  This is why I moved out of the house.  Even though I should be there helping my dad, I know that they would have this unbelievable control over my life.  Nothing I do is good enough for my parents.  I do not do what they want me to do, and they hate it.  They don't seem to want to let me have control over my own life.  Here I am, I graduated from college, I have a good job, I'm doing fine on my own, and yet they still think that I am 15 and I don't have a brain cell in my head worth a damn.  Well, you know what?  I'm still going to do whatever I want to.
I felt like something was up today at school.  When I was done and in my car, I turned on my cell and sure enough there were 3 texts from him.  They said that he couldn't make it today.  His brother got jumped last night and was in the hospital.  I talked to him briefly tonight and he said that he didn't think anyone was going to get charged... and that no one was going to sue.  That frustrated me a little bit...  these assholes are not going to pay for what they did.  He's thinking about taking the vigilante route, but if he does that, he runs the risk of ruining his future teaching career.  I don't want him to do that.  Anyway... so here I sit at 8:45 on a Friday night with nothing to do.  I guess I'll have to go find something.
Shawn and I are hanging out tomorrow night!  Oh happy day!  If his paycheck clears, he is coming down here, and if it doesn't, I guess I am going up there.  I have a good feeling about this one.  Hopefully y'all will send your good feelings over this way, too.
I know the views that I'm about to post are controversial, but it's good to question things sometimes.  I saw this on another blog, and I thought it was worth the post.
