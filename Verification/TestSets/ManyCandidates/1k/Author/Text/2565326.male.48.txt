"So make the effort to be fulfilled and enjoy yourself. Enjoy this Life. You will appreciate more and more. Don't waste another moment on a wasted moment. That's what we do. We waste one moment and then we waste four more on that moment. Go forward"  -Prem Rawat Amaroo, 2004

There is always a time when someone comes to terms with existence and recognizes the magic of this breath. Of course for some it's no surprise that we wake up and go on doing our dayly routine. But for the one who's life is a gift and knows its value, the surprise is always a pleasant one.  One day we may fall asleep for good and never wake up again. Same goes for our consciousness. That is the reason why, at times, I need to feel awaken and surprised. It's human nature to know and to feel this magic. I only have a prayer... please keep me always conscious of the gift I have when at times I may forget its value. Always let me rejoice for this existence you've given me. Always let me have gratitude and recognize where I am truly coming from. Because this is where I reside...inside... my true home.

There is one that keeps coming up at the top about God. I clicked on it, and at the start, it has an interesting concept to ponder on. It is something like, whatever you do, do it for the glory of God...eg. eating, etc.

urlLink    Permanent spectacle&nbsp; urlLink
For me, when I tune into the source of appreciation, the more I find I am able to enjoy what's around me in greater depth. This blog is a space for people to post, or enjoy visual creations (text too), and other things they enjoy.
The words of peace are seeds, which germinate in the compost of our heart. When we feel vagueness in our soul, let us suspend the instant and with respect and grace, let us choose one inspiration from the river of the breath, that one very particular, which carries us to our secret garden, where we can admire the small growths of serenity. And if the feeling delights us, then to talk of all these inspirations  which become a permanent spectacle .  Marie
Hi ... first just wished to thank-you for the invitation.  Any opportunity to express is a joy to me.  There is so much fulfillment flooding our individual doorsteps, that one has to allow that outlet to pour, so more joy can enter our domains.  I know that when we share in the moment the love that has been revelaed to us, it only brightens us further, as we enter that light that has infinite capacity.  In a world starving for this experience, it would be the ultimate level of selfishness if we did not allow it to be brought forth out into the public domain.  However really there is nowhere we cannot be where this love is not.   Just sometimes we can laser that concentration so it becomes more obvious.  So may we shine ... and in so doing assist in this noble endeavor to light the lamps that stand in wait, for just one strike of that matchless match.
HELLO Kay, it is a nice idea for you to do this blogger. Thank you. I understand now. Marie
...the inner experience is enjoyable.  ( Of course other things are enjoyable too, but everyone already knows that!)
This blog is for fun!

"There is a joy, and it is the joy of existence—not what is happening in existence. They are two different things. There is the joy of existence, and then there is the joy of what is happening in existence. What is happening in existence we try to control and manipulate.   Sometimes things go our way. Sometimes they don't.  But then there is another joy. That joy has been there through all the years of your life, waiting to be discovered. And that joy will be there for as long as you live. It is the simple, simple joy of being alive.   In my life, there are good days and there are bad days. The days I call good are the days when everything goes according to my plan. The days when things do not go according to my plan, I call bad. Yet every day that I have been given is above and beyond being good and bad. Each one has its own meaning and its own beauty. And I can get in touch with that beauty. My plans will change. Sometimes the days I call bad actually end up being good. And some days when everything looks like it is going according to my plan turn out to be a disaster.   Good and bad. Life is not just about good and bad—it is beyond that. When we begin to understand that, we begin to understand that it is a privilege to be alive. It is a privilege for which this heart needs to be filled with gratitude. What we have been given is far more precious than a
