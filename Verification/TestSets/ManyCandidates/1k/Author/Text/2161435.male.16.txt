it began to rain. Fortuneately Dave had bought them all ponchos, so they sheltered under them.  Soon an evil fairy appeared to them, and revealed that it was called snorkmaiden. The evil fairy told them not to go to...
...find what you all desire/need, and only then can you go home and avoid looking eachother in the eye afterwards.' The group stared at eachother, all felt that they were happy so what could they possibly need? 'How about looking in the mirror from Harry Potter that showed your hearts desire?' suggested Vicky 'And where is this mirror?' inquired Rob 'We'd have to ask Dumbledore' 'But...' and so on and so forth Rob destroyed Vicky's logic till the Davemother who knew Vicky to be right, stopped Rob by giving him blue eyes, rosy cheeks and a cute little dog to complete the sissy look. Rob hid behind a tree. 'Now listen,' the davemother said, 'i will give you a clue for what Rob needs...or I shall just tell you cause he really needs MODESTY!' 'Do not, Im perfect!' Rob proclaimed The others looked at eachother and agreed first get the modesty before midnight (well you know that someone would kill Rob if he didnt have some by then) and then after to search for this mirror and seek what each desired. The fairy davemother was to come along to, to finally rid her/himself of this cross dressing curse bestowed by someone with a poor sense of humour. And off they went on their journey but had not gone far when...
out of it on one reef. Yes, we're talking to you, Bri-y.  Who says red isn't my colour? And I'd prefer my uber- mohawk to pigtails, if it's all the same to you. So, quickly restyling his hair, Rob asked the fairy Davemother what their quest was to be.   "Well," he said  "what you must do is..."
...the yellow brick road. They all looked around in amazement, it was all there, the little yellow bricks, the house that crashed there cause dorothy hadnt passed drivers ed. and rob...in the red sparkly shoes which oddly suited him with the little pig tails and checkered dress he was wearing, however, thought Bri, red lipstick just isnt his colour! Rob blushed and a tear fell from his eye! Then bubbles began to appear and the fairy came to tell them their quest. You guessed it was gonna be Dave right? well you were completely....
court for non payment of car tax. But Rob, being a legend, got them cleared of all charges, and in fact had the prosecution ordered to pay them hefty fees for misuse of their time. What a nice guy Rob is. Check  him  out. Anyway, with another wave of Vicky's magic wand, they were off, off, to...
...a prehistoric fan as he realised that the car was seriously hot. He pondered why it was so as he looked out at the sky with that flaming ball....approaching....kinda fast....ah....shit. Vicky, was well prepared though and whipped out a wand to take them all away from their impending doom and took them all to...
Induce the transcendal thrusters and take the car straight over the top of the wall.  As the wall flew past underneath, Rob hiccupped, then got really pissed off. Suddenly, Vicky flew in through the window, proclaiming:  "Put your fingers in your ears, hold your nose, and swallow three times!"  Rob did as she said; the result was instantaneous: Everyone started laughing, which didn't help.  Rob continued hiccuping, until he stopped.  Then he pulled out a...
...change the gears' So Rob was attempting to change the gears as Bri-y explained she only drove so randomly, so as not to hit any birds. Rob looked out at the empty, birdless sky and raised an eyebrow. Meanwhile Emily woke up in the back seat and saw that as the other two were arguing they were rapidly approaching a wall. There was nothing else she could do but...
Emily. She appeared to be dead, but upon closer inspection was in fact just resting. But Rob had other things on his mind,  mainly Bri-y's driving. She was all over the sky. Shocking. However, Rob new how to solve this.   "If you drive straight, then I'll..."
...Rob woke up and smelled the coffee which he promptly pushed away, (it having been there in his room for a few years). It was all a dream, he sighed. He stared out his window and looked at a blue speck approaching him. As it got closer it grew in size till it became the car out of Harry Potter. With Bri in the driving seat Rob was apprehensive, but with a final look at his mess...cough...room, he got in the flying car which flew to the clouds, and was looking out the window once more when he realised there was another in the car. It was none other than....
Once upon a time, Rob was really damn sexy. Lots of women had commented on this. They siad to him:   "Rob, you are a sexy bitch"  "thank you" said Rob  "Thou speakest truth" Said God.  And so, sitting in his enchanted glade, Rob was quite content with life. He just been sailing with a happy goblin, who was very happy.  In the heat of the day, Rob dozed off. He awoke a few hours later to the sound of smashing. Looking into his portable welsh dresser (where he kept all of his chinaware,) he saw something smashing. It was a piece of paper that said:  "Congratulations, Rob, you have won Â£1,000!"  It was the first time Rob had ever heard paper speak.    Reaching behind him, he picked up his phone, and rang his bank manager to tell him the good news.  They were celebrating together when suddenly...
