Accounting can be quite a tedious job! I have just created a MS access database for my company's accounting. Phew! But I guess it is a must to maintain it so that I can monitor how it is going.  I just configured my router up and running. And I just revived a old compaq notebook and install wireless on it. My router is wireless! WOOHOO it works like magic now but I do have problem earlier :)  Everything went well I got a well deserved sleep plus I dun have to wear Shirt anymore tomorrow so I will not be ironing any more shirt!!!! CHEERS!!!!!! But I have limited polo-ts I guess it is time for some serious shopping! I need another 3 more decent polo t for my SIZE. Yes I emphasize on it cos it is pretty tough to get my size.  Name card, Company stamp....cannot forget!!
First day of work on Saturday isn't as easy as I think it would be. In fact so many screwed up till I cannot have my first meal of the day until 4pm. Even though it is tough I will persist no matter how difficult it gets.....  Life isn't a bed of roses all the time....and i bought a few inspiration back home from popular book store. Three pieces... It goes like  "Talent and effort are nothing without focus and determination"
I woke up early but no longer have the drive to work since tomorrow is my last day. Was planning for what is coming up next. Plans and proposal is on the way. July will be a busy month for my new job and studies. Gotta put in some effort on it.  Meet buddy and Vernon on the way home and damn upper changi road east the road was fugging JAM up cause of a long trailer accident. Made and U turn and saw vernon's "VIPERED" car. Woohoo. But entire day I been drooling at at least 5 evos on the road.....It's a dream....but I want this dream come true! Most definitely!  Waiting for big tv and refrigerator at Adrian and Jen house tomorrow and can slack all day long!
Bloopy as in day fill with work but your mind is no longer about working stuff. I am all in for what's coming up real soon. And I can't wait to start the ball rolling! Been into some calculation and planning phase about financial controlling and rolling plus some further development.   My mind is pretty bloated but at least get things done with what I wanted. My last day will be on this coming friday. I will be starting my new job on Saturday I HOPE! And still require some discussion later at my friend's company.  Life is all good but again I am left with two days to stuck with shirt as I will be going on polo T real soon! Yeeee Haaaa! I also realise class 95 love to play Hey ya!   Ahh and not forgetting damn Ben for saying the wrong things to the wrong person! YES i find her cute and very cute but you don't have to tell her mum that I should call her Mum-in-law right? I was totally embarrassed! And YEAH! She is cute, quiet, smart and a woman with her own sets of mindset and opinion! I am there so frequently at bukit timah shopping centre is because just to catch a glimpse of her! She is damn damn cute. HAHAHA especially when she is reading the papers regarding soccer. YES! She is the first female soccer fan I ever come across! Special isn't it? Hope can get a few more glimpse before she found a job. Damn but seems that there isn't any topic to chat about....How to start man and lady?   I want a steamer! I want a steamer! I want a steamer! I want a steamer!  And this will bring me to my sweet dreams!
YES I RESIGNING!  After a no update on Sunday, I got a big surprise! I resigning from my new and current company and will officially leave on this coming friday. Not because of any unhappy stuff in fact they got one of the most wonderful bosses i ever come across in my life time. Really nice people I mean it.   But because of better opportunities out there, I have to think for my own future as well. Yes my company is going relive with a couple of factors coming in together. It is a matter of factors that come together at the correct timing resulted in me leaving my current company. If I miss this opportunity, I might have to wait for some more time and I will grab it tightly else I will regret over it again. I missed a couple and I do not want to miss it again.  This is kind of stress for me as I can no longer be so extravagant on my spending because everything do matters now. Also a time to build my discipline and control. Let's wish me all the best to my future endeavour!   It's not about how many times you fell, it's about how you able to climb back everytime you fell. ---  The Unknown

Steven and Evelyn is the couple. We reach the bride's place with horning and exhaust sound that awaken almost the entire neighbourhood. Brothers gathered and up we go. Money was not really an issue when asking for keys to enter the bride's place but the second round all the brothers had to do push up and YES I have to do as well oh DAMN IT hahaha! It has been at least 3 or 4 years since i last do a push up during basketball training.   All of us had to go down and do ten oh boy with my weight it is really very tedious for me b
