Thats me rediscovering my blogspot..have been educating self on what the world thinks of bloggers..and not very pleased with what I read..hmph.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rebel on bloggers!  Finally..folks DO believe Instant&nbsp;Messenger is useful (MSN invested huge greenies in it last week).. I&nbsp;find the&nbsp;whole idea behind the IM rather Zany (noun. Extremely cool and&nbsp;fun.) Thank you for whole-hearted applause.&nbsp;Especially&nbsp;the Yahoo Messenger. The smileys are just unbelievably funny.. Call it my&nbsp;new&nbsp;hobby if you will, but if a messenger allows me to listen to&nbsp;love songs while i play a silly game of cards&nbsp;with my mom,it is a notch above even Zany (noun. The highest form of praise in&nbsp;the blogger dictionary).&nbsp;Anyways..discoveries of the&nbsp;past week.  1) rediscovering Bourne - part. two is plain mindblowing. Damn the critics. Really, if it is a possible action, damn them. Has all the effects needed for a spy movie and it ROCKS!  2) Hearing crazy things about the village..apparently the demons the villagers are scared of are industries and construction crews.hm...i pay 8$&nbsp;for this?  3)&nbsp;Blogmania. from&nbsp;DNC to&nbsp;product launches. Well, smtg like this was bound to happen wasnt it. We had Internet, then mail, then IM (loyalty rolls on)..then the public&nbsp;had zilch to jump&nbsp;around for. Larger mailboxes, yaaawwnn... its like the discovery of fridge Vs. Large&nbsp;fridges. Who&nbsp;cares anymore? but blogging is definitely a phenomenon.&nbsp;Blogging&nbsp;101 in universities,&nbsp;blogger&nbsp;moms and blogging conventions. Will be damned if am not into this early.&nbsp;Then can proceed to preen about life-long blogging talent when am&nbsp;45.&nbsp;Zany as it&nbsp;may seem&nbsp;(Zany. Noun. crazy,illogical or&nbsp;blind sheep phenomenon).  4) waistlines - woeful discovery of the week. waistline remains at a puppy fattish 28 only to grow to 30 by lunchtime. Scientific fact that waistlines balloon during the day (when i shall wear tight jeans that pop out buttons like popcorn by lunchtime). hmph..how Zany is that (Zany. undependable. untrustable).  Oh well..got an exciting week coming up.lets see now. Therez the school reunion tonite at a coffee shop (with a guaranteed "thou shalt be lost" address by Atsuko). Tomorrow shall relaunch ditched website project. Doc apintment on Friday. YUCK..absolutely definite blogging on THAT day...  &nbsp; Zanycally yours    &nbsp;
Two terms i came across this week...after a mind-numbing task of deciding which one to attack first, have placed my gifted criticism priority on the former, so here goes.  Golf-widows..a rather pathetic term but apparently one who qualifies is J-Lo. Marc Anthony is addicted to golf and the damsel in distress took out enough time to pouteth her lips and sulk about it before she went back to count her fast-depleting money.But seriously, could there be a more self-congratulatory term ever? I mean, this is a sport where the aim is "not to make a fool of yourself". not funny, is the serious truth. Its the kind of sport that one would indulge in, and the rest of the folks around him would go "WHY do you do this to yourself". kinda like waxing and threading that babes subject themselves too (of course..the women who DO wax and thread before their weekly round of golf come across as a psycologically interesting catergory of 'pain lovers')...This is a game where factors do not end at sports skills and weather conditions and calamities such as untied shoe-laces. Oh no siree..It is a game where the factors could include any or all of the following  1) curious rabbits 2) hungry deer 3) frost, dew, insects or any such thing existing in the grass 4)crabs in the sand  Apart from including half of the animal species as considerable factors, one would be required to have a hand-held weather device to indicate wind, snow, sun, wind direction or any such calamities that might decrease the chances of hitting a hole in one.   Inspite of all this, no self-proclaimed golfer could ever say he comes home with a satisfactory golf experience. It takes no less than 6 hours of carting around a golf course to achieve a satisfactory level of frustration before you consider yourself done for the day. Thats right, carting around.God forbid you are caught walking around - fancy gadgets that push your clubs for you  to carts that you can around jiggling in are a part of the experience. snort!! give me good ole waxing anyday. and yeah, throw in a bit of the threading and tweezing too   and WHY would anyone call herself Esther? THERE IS A CHEMICAL ALMOST LIKE THAT NAME ALREADY!!not that madonna was an original name, but if you do wish to switch names, leave chemistry labs and medicines out of it please. Though, it does bring up an interesting option. WHAT would you change your name to? would you change it to smtg that reflects your personality? I would find a whole lot of folks calling themselves pretty and kind walking around then..Me? i would change it to smtg like medussa (during bad hair days atleast) or medulla oblongata (when at my brainiest best) or muddled (a default name)  I would certainly choose smtg that means BAD..that way when i am nice, nobody's complaining..they are only pleasantly surprised...  Anti-golfically yours Medusa muddled Medulla (muddled is my middle name)
hmm..am supposed to be knee-deep with responses to my blog by now according to my "Despo's guide to blogging" (despo meaning desperate not despodent though lack of resposes invoke similar reactions in self).  Read an interesting article on blogging though (http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,64088,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_4) in the time i managed to switch (am self-proclaimed Alt + Tab Queen) to another browser window.   Apparently, blogging takes the life out of bloggers and is considered an ego stroking exercise. hmm.now why would that be? This is exactly the kind of articles that prompt penniless authors to become penniful by writing books such as 'The new social evil of blogging' that goes onto proclaim blogging as a potential threat to productive employees. Then companies can pass resolutions to ban employee blogging, thus making it more tempting for them to bog on the sly - thus making blogsites more successful by the day. Its all a conspiracy i tell you, I didnt watch the Matrix for nothing. Some conspiracies I have noted though:  1) notice how everyone thinks t
