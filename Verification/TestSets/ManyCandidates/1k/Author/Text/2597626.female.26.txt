Go now and read the latest article by  urlLink Ann Coulter .  I can wait.  ...  ...  ...  Did you read it?  Good.  Encourage all your liberal friends to read it.  It will either challenge them to think about who they support and why, or it will annoy them.  Either way you win!!
This  urlLink story  is chilling.  It outlines what the terrorists wanted.  It was, sadly what they got.  Spain fell for the terrorist trick.  They expected that other nations would falter and the US would be left alone in Iraq.  That did not happen, and we know they will try again.  It's a given.  This article reinforces the need for the partners in Iraq to remain strong in the face of terrorists.  People who say we should back down, should leave the Middle East, are no better than terrorists.    Shocking, huh??
The father of slain civilian Nick Berg was quoted in an  urlLink article  published by the AP as saying, "What I'm trying to do is show to the American people and the British people ... that war has a wretchedly horrible face,"   I'm afraid we have seen that face, Mr. Berg.  We got a really good look on 9/11 when we were attacked by cowards who killed thousands of innocents in an attempt to destroy us on our own ground.  Yes, Mr. Berg, we have seen it.  We see it again and again in the eyes of cowards who kill innocent people in the name of Allah.    Do not ever doubt that we have seen it.  What I wonder is how you can sleep at night knowing you are using the death of your son for political gain?    Mr. Berg went on to say, "There are 11,000 plus Iraqi citizens that are dead and each one's family is as affected as I was, but the American media doesn't cover these people. It doesn't cover the people who are suffering the most."  How about the thousands who died in the torture rooms and rape rooms under Saddam's rule?  What about the people who were killed for speaking out against the evil of Saddam and his sons?  What about the  thousands of lives saved  by our going to Iraq?  Why does no media outlet report that?   Because, the Media does not cover the things that happen in Iraq that make us look good.  Where is your sense of injustice for that?  The Media refuses to report anything in a positive light in the Middle East.   The final quote of the article is:      "Observing someone's pain just makes you think just how can they (Bush and Blair) possibly do this. There isn't enough money in the world that could ever make this worthwhile."   This man lost a son, and for that I am truly sorry, but what makes me even more sorry is the way he is  using  his son to promote a liberal agenda.  He returns to the favorite liberal mantra, 'Bush did it for the money, he did it for the oil.'  Your propaganda has blinded you to the truth.  It is people like you, Mr. Berg that the terrorists just love.
This is a great idea.  We should all do this.  Give a party or attend a party!!  urlLink http://www.georgewbush.com/party/PartyEvent.aspx
Monday was a great day!!  We handed over Iraq to the people of Iraq.  I have been reading http://www.iraqthemodel.blogspot.com this evening and I am so surprised and happy.  There is a seed of hope in me that is starting to take root.  Every day I am grateful for my country, for our military, for the bravery of the Iraqi people, and for my President.    This makes me ponder . . .   Why is it that the American media does not report the joy that so many in Iraq feel over the transition?  I know they want to do whatever they can to make the average citizen feel ashamed they are American.  Shame on them for doing that!!!  What we did in Iraq needed to be done.  We, along with the UK and our other partners (no international support, HA!!  If I were any citizen of a nation that helped in the fight to deliver freedom to Iraq I would be protesting this VERY loudly EVERY day!!!), helped to bring freedom to people who were drowning in the oppression of the Saddam regime.  How, may I ask, is that bad??  How can we bring terror if we deliver freedom?  John Kerry was out again today mouthing off about how we need an international backing and how he would be the man to bring peace to Iraq with international support.  Sen. Kerry, I have no words to express how much you offend me.  You have no right at all to bad mouth the president when you have been weak on American security, American Military AND you protested against your own troops when you returned from Vietnam.     You voted against the money that is going to support the troops in Iraq (after you voted for it) and you are out there everyday telling us how bad things are going and how Bush led us into this war with lies.     I am afraid of where you would lead this nation.  Into the hands of the UN?     If we pull all of our troops out of the Middle East and tell them we are really,  really  sorry, then maybe, just maybe, they will see how truly nice we are.  They may forget the error of their civilan killing, homicide bombing, WMD making, cowardly beheading on video to scare innocent people ways, and be our friends??    FAT CHANCE!!!!   All you are doing, Sen. Kerry, is delivering the same propaganda that is fed to the media.  In case you have not noticed the international community HATES us.  They have not stood with us when the chips were down.  They paid lip service after 9/11, but they hate us as much as Michael Moore.  (More on him another Blog)    The terrorists would love nothing more than for the Americans to leave the Middle East so they can once again c
