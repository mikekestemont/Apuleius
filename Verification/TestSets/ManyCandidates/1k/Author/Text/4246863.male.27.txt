At PokerStars.com they have nine &amp; 18 people sit and go tournaments. They vary in costs from $5 to $5000 (no kidding) and usually last between 45 minutes to an hour and a half. Basically, you pay the entry fee, get 1500 in chips, and play until there is a winner. Placing in 2nd and 3rd will make you money in the nine player game. The 18 player game pays out to four winners. I decided to play the better odds and play only at the nine player tables. At the nine player table I have at least a 33% chance of winning, as opposed to the 22% chance at the 18 player table. Of course, the 18 player table has bigger payouts. Over the weekend I played in four of them. Here's a breakdown of each one:  1) I spent the better part of the entire game folding. I folded so much, I suddenly found myself in fourth place with only about 150 in chips, which at that point was lower than the big blind. When the blind came to me, I was put all in and dealt a K/Q suited. I flopped two pair and won the hand. I eventually won another hand to put my chip count back over a 1,000 and outlasted one other guy to put myself in third place. Four hands later I had about 2,000 in chips and the chip leader had been suddenly bounced from the table, pitting me with 2,000 chips against the only guy left, with 11,000 chips. Needless to say, a few hands later, I was out. However, due to my patience, I won $13.50. I'd like to take a moment to pat myself on the back.  2) Much the same as the first one, but this time I got bumped out in third place and won $9.00. I actually don't remember much of this one at all other than finishing in third.  3) Got put out rather quickly and finished in eighth place. I went all-in with three of a kind (10's) and a King kicker. Some asshole had the Ace kicker. Oh well.  4) After my disappointing showing in the big tournament (see previous post), I figured I'd give a sit and go one more try before I went to bed. Guess what? I got decent cards, playable flops, made some good calls, and ended up winning the match in less than an hour. That win was good for $22.00. Even better was that I took out this guy who habitually pre-flop raised to try and bully pots and other players, gleefully showing his 3/6 unsuited when everyone folded. Karma bit him in the ass later in the game, when heads up against me, I was dealt an A/A, K/K, an A/K suited on three out of five hands to take him out. He wouldn't even reciprocate the "good game" I gave him in the chat bar after I took his chips, rather going with the always popular "f*** you."  All told, I spent $22 to join the tables and won $43.50. Can't complain about that.
Well, for starters, let's just say I didn't fare to well in the final standings. Of 2200 or so participants, I finished in 873rd place, miles out of the money.  The good news was that I actually saw quite a few decent starting hands. The bad news was that I saw quite a few useless flops. For example, my last hand I was dealt an A/Q suited and was beat by a pair of three's. True story.  And since I got dealt several quality hands like the one above, I spent quite a few chips pre-flop raising to bump people out. Of course, it didn't matter as I ended up folding after the flop or turn, 200-300 chips lighter than before.  Oh well, it was only three bucks.
Last night I entered into a $5 per person poker tournament at PokerStars.com; which is a pretty good place to play poker online. I have had no complaints with their service thus far. Anyway, when registration came to a close, there were 1640 players, with a first place prize of $1,886.00. The top 135 people were to come away with prize money.  I spent much of the first 30-35 minutes of the tournament folding. After my first 35 hands, I had seen the flop only twice. Nothing good was coming my way. I wasn't disheartened though, in that time period I only lost about 130 in chips from my original 1500 and over 300 people had already busted out. Then it happened. I was dealt an A/3 suited while the big blind with three calls but no raises. I checked and the flop came out A/A/3, giving me a full house. I bet 500 into the pot, hoping someone would have the other Ace and raise. Sure enough, someone did, he raised another 500, I re-raised all-in and he called. We showed our cards and he was sitting on an A/2 unsuited and pretty much out of the pot unless a pair dropped on the turn and river, which didn't. I didn't knock him out, but I raised my chip count from 1300 to 3700. I immediately got hot and won a few more hands to drive my chip count up to 5,300 just before the first break.  After the break I was still in control of the table and pushed my chip count up to 8100. At that point, I had the big stack at the table and was in the top 50 in total chips. Then, about 20 minutes in, they closed our table and moved me to a different one. This wouldn't have been so bad except that I was now the short stack at the table. WTF!? I was literally sitting at a table with two players who had 20,000 in chips and two more who had over 15,000 in chips.  Despite being suddenly disadvantaged, I stuck to my game plan and played tight. I won a couple of smaller pots a
