Research and Writing    urlLink http://www.visualthesaurus.com/index.jsp  Visual Thesarus is a way cool interactive thesaurus. You type in a term, click, and your term is instantly surrounded on-screen by a web of synonyms and antonyms.

XSL (eXtensible Stylesheet Language)   XSL is a new and exciting league of professional American football sweeping the nation.  Take a American football and add a twist of Aussie rules, throw in liberal amounts of lethal explosives, a healthy dose of heavy metal music, scantily clothed women, and lots of alcohol and you have . . . okay, so that’s the WWF.

As its name suggests, XSL was drafted initially to give developers specific language tools to augment XML functionality.
