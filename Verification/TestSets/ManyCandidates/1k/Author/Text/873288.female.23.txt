First things first. I am slightly confused at times by Icelandic-English, but I believe not as confused as you would be by my English-Icelandic, so we'll stick to English as a medium of conversation, I guess (until we all master Icelandic). It might be tough for Lars, Magnus, Vegard, et al. to give up their "primitive" tongues and learn Icelandic though (haha). Well, believe it or not, I hung out with an Icelandic girl last night. Yes, there are more than 2 of them. I couldn't get enough of Iceland, what with the sheep cheek and dried fish, so boy was I glad to find out my friend is dating a girl who grew up in Iceland until age 16. We shot the shit about all things Icelandic, from that crazy non-alcoholic malt stuff (child's play) to Thule. I exhausted her knowledge of Iceland in about 5 minutes, so I proceeded to teach her all the things Ulli (sorry I have no accent mark ` key) taught me about Iceland and life in general. So in other words, the conversation continued another week :)  Ulli prepared me well to educate her about her own country.   So, I've got my fingers crossed that this e-mail will actually send and I will not lose everything I've hitherto typed. You see, I'm still using the old dial-up modem, yeah the one from the 90s, and it's not the most reliable. George W. is off playing with laser-guided Smart bombs somewhere, and I can't even get a freakin cable modem. Blame my tightwad parents for that one, I suppose. Oh well, back to school in a few weeks. Then it's back to real studying and real classes. No more ESADE Leadership, where the essence of the course is "do whatever you want and tell us that you learned something in the end." As this is my first blogging experience, I should probably cut it short lest I become burnt out at a young age.   Tim
If you are a "gringo" visiting for the first time please read the thing below first but if not go a head and read this.  Well its best to begin bloging writing about something that nobody should realy care about but.... what the heck.... The climate here has been realy strange and I think Iceland is again behaving like ICELAND. Yesterday I wen to work at 8 in the morning and yes there was a rather bad weather but that doesnt happen to rarely in this country but usually it just goes by. Well I saw that it didnt realy but when I turned on the radio it said that pretty much every road out of the city was closed and on the others one was recomended to use a well equiped jeep if going out of the city. There where like 500 incidents of people having to call the rescuers to help them out of snow coz they werent going anywhere without help. I heard about this one guy who was suppose to arrive at work at 16 (thats 4 pm for those on my west) but went out of his house at 10 just to help people out of snow, his girlfriend told me that it was most definatly his favorite day of the year!!! The guy who was suppose to do my job at 16 (see above if you cant remember) lives in town very close to Reykjavík and when I looked outside he just saw the top of his car so he called his dad who has a "well equiped jeep".  In the most windy spot of Reykjavík the wind speed went to 30 meters a second so I hope nobody forgot their laundry outsite.   You are most definatly rather bored by this so Im gonna tell you some strange facts about Icelanders and the year 2003:  1. In the begining of this mont  Icelanders where 290.490 wich makes 0,79% growth a year. On that pace we will be 300.000 late 2007!!!! YEAH GO ICELANDIC WOMEN  2. On the other hand 1.400.000 went through the internacional airport in 2003  3. For my imortal belowed Emerging Economies class it would be interesting that there was 84% working participant and something like 4% unemployment which we think is alot.  4. In last election on 10. of May 87,7% of the listed voted, that is I think more than the record in the US of A.  5. In 2003 there where sold 345 million cigarettes and 11,8 thousand cigars.  6. In my favorite part there where sold 350.000 liters of vodka and unspiced alcahol, 10.200.000 liters of beer and 1.050.000 liters of red wine.  7. An average person farts 14 a day... so each person, in the world, farted 5110 in 2003 so that makes 1.500.000.000 Icelandic farts in this very nice year... something to be proud of.  8. The average Icelander ate 53 kilos of sugar, the average Magnus and Vegard (Swedish and Norwiegan persons) ate 43 kilos and 33 kilos each Danish and Finnish person.  9. Average weight of an Icelandic 25 year old is 67,5 kilos and 74 of 55 year olds. The men on the other side do weight 81,7 kilos at 25 and 88 kilos at 55.  10. Acording to a survey made by Durex Icelanders are very happy with their sex life and the times an average Icelander had sex was 96 times.  11. In 2003 Icelanders sent close to 150 million sms´s which makes around 500 sms´s a person over the year.  Well now you must wiser so send me something to post!!!  Saludos, Úlli
Hey people,  Ok this is Úlli, I have been wondering about how we can all stay in touch for the next few years coz I really dont want us to fade apart and how could we do that. It´s no doubt that some of us will keep in touch forever but Im worrying about those I knew but wherent my best friends and I bet some others feel the same way.  This I would say is a rather g
