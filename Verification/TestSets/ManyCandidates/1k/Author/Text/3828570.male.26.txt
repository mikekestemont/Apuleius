Saw this today.....hilarious commentary on the 2004 Election...   urlLink Link    (It has some language...so be warned.)
I got an email from Randy (Kevin's manager) today...Hallelujah is done! The studio work was done yesterday, and the mixing today, so by mid-next week, I should have the recording in my hands.  For those not up to speed, I've been working with Kevin Max ( urlLink website ) to record a cover of Leonard Cohen's song  Hallelujah  to use over the end credits of my upcoming short film,  Habeas Corpus .  Stay tuned, and I'll keep you posted on our progress.  We're going to be putting together a little promotional teaser soon, so I'll let you know when that's done.
I watched a hilarious film today... The Work and the Story , a "mockumentary" about small town Mormon filmmakers and the search for the next "Mormon Spielberg."  Coming from a Fundamentalist background myself, one of my favorite parts was a cutaway to a short film (very short...about 8-9 seconds), called "A Good Boy Doesn't Do That."  It's just a shot of a boy, and an offscreen woman's voice says, "What do you want to do when you grow up?"  The boy looks up and says, "I want to make movies!"  And then a hand comes in and slaps him.  Freeze frame. The End.  Check it out...  The  urlLink IMDb page
I got a kick out of this...from IMDb's  urlLink news page...    Hollywood actor Benjamin Bratt suffered the ultimate embarrassment when he agreed to surprise a fan on Oprah Winfrey's chat show - she had no idea who he was. Bratt was initially happy to go along with making his alleged admirer's day, but once the two met he quickly learned that a big mistake had been made somewhere along the line.   He recalls, "There was the story of an aunt who had written in to the show saying that her niece is a huge Benjamin Bratt fan and she was disappointed because she couldn't get tickets for the show. So the producers of the show wanted to surprise her. They called her down to a spa in downtown Chicago and they told her that she was going to be the recipient of a massage and a facial, etc. Well, the gag was for me to show up with a bouquet of flowers and walk out to the lobby where she was sitting and say, as I did, 'Hi, I'm Benjamin Bratt, I'm going to be your masseur for the day!' She just looked up at me and went, 'Okay...' She had no idea who I was! The aunt got the niece to show up at the spa and she had no idea who I was, so needless to say, it was footage that was completely unusable. It was incredibly humbling."
I'm thinking about doing a remake of this classic 1950 film-noir feature....it opens with a man walking into a police station and saying, "I want to report a murder."  "Who is the victim?" they ask.  The man answers, "I am."  He's been poisoned, and has only 24 hours left to find his killer.  You can actually download the original version of the film  urlLink here.   (It's now in the public domain.)  The D.O.A.  urlLink  IMDb page.
During an intense high wind/rain/hail storm last week, I was at home, talking to my wife on the phone.  I said, "this thunder is so loud it's shaking the house!"  Ten mintues later I called her back and said, "actually, that wasn't thunder."  Yes, friends, a tree fell on our house, with me and the kids inside.  Here are the photos.  (Caution treehuggers....these may be disturbing.)        There appears to be no real damage to the house...although I think its ego may have been bruised a bit.
I came upon this sign the other day.  It reminded me of the scene in Minority Report where the signs are calling him by name....talk about direct marketing.      In the event that this post makes no sense to you, it may help to know that my dog's name is Tony.
I received this email today.....my response follows below.   ---------------------------------------------------    USPS New Stamp   This one is impossible to believe.. Scroll down for the text.  If there is only one thing you forward today.....let it be this!   REMEMBER the MUSLIM bombing of PanAm  Flight 103!   REMEMBER the MUSLIM bombing of the World  Trade Center in 1993!   REMEMBER the MUSLIM bombing of the Marine  barracks in Lebanon!   REMEMBER the MUSLIM bombing of the military  barracks in Saudi Arabia!   REMEMBER the MUSLIM bombing of the American  Embassies in Africa!   REMEMBER the MUSLIM bombing of the USS COLE!   REMEMBER the MUSLIM attack on the Twin Towers on 9/11/2001!   REMEMBER all the AMERICAN lives that were  lost in those vicious MUSLIM attacks!    Now the United States Postal Service REMEMBERS and HONORS the  EID MUSLIM holiday season with a commemorative first class  holiday postage stamp.   REMEMBER to adamantly and vocally BOYCOTT this stamp  when purchasing your stamps at the post office.  To use this stamp would be a slap in the face to all those  AMERICANS who died at the hands of those whom this stamp honors.   REMEMBER to pass this along to every patriotic AMERICAN you know.     ----------------------------------------------------    My response:     One could just as easily say:   --------------------------------------------------   REMEMBER the CHRISTIAN Crusades in which soldiers swept over Jerusalem and slaughtered men, women and children, 'until their horses were knee deep in blood!'   REMEMBER Charlemagne, a devout CHRISTIAN who, after conquering the Saxon rebels, gave them a choice between baptism and execution. When they refused to convert, he had 4500 of them beheaded in one morning!   REMEMBER Constantine, the first Roman Emperor to become a CHRISTIAN, who had over 3000 Christians executed because their interpretation of the Bible did not agree with his!   REMEMBER the CHRISTIAN Spanish Inquisition Tribunal, which ordered extermination of 3 million rebels in the Netherlands!   REMEMBER that in the 4th and 5th centuries synagogues were burned and Jews killed by CHRISTIANS!   REMEMBER the Nazis (lead by someone who claimed to be a CHRISTIAN) who exterminated millions of Jews, while other CHRISTIANS set u
