After that hellish travel day, I finally arrived at David's and we were almost immediately out the door to go get lunch. We went to  urlLink Au Pied De Cuchon , a favorite spot. Most things on the menu are excellent but what makes it a favorite is their escargot. If you think escargot are gross then you obviously haven't had them here. They cook them in their shells with pesto sauce and bring them out on a metal plate that has indentations for each one. You get tongs to hold the shell and a special little fork to get them out of there. We could be having an intense discussion, arguing or in the middle of a story and as soon as the escargot arrive there's a silence that continues until they are all gone. For the main course I had Magret du Canard. A dish I had been longing for since leaving France the last time. Unfortunately, I was tired and when the waiter asked me how I wanted it, I said, "medium" almost unconsciously. What I should have said is "rare" because that's the way to have Magret du Canard. It was still really good. It came with this fig dish that had philo dough on the bottom and then figs and, I think, beets on top. Very unique flavor. Subtly sweet.  If I wasn't so tired, I'd describe every meal I've had - the amazing Turkish food, the fresh milk camembert, the entrecot, and even the violet soda. The food here is at least a few notches above and usually several notches above food that I have had anywhere else. San Francisco is a great food city but Paris is on a whole other level. No mexican food though so I made sure to get my fill of Tacqueria Cancun before leaving SF.   Oh yeah, we've been getting ready to leave for India in less than two weeks.

I hope he enjoyed that cigarette
I woke up at 6:10 AM. My friend Robynn scheduled to pick me up at 6:15. I had set the alarm but forgot to turn it on. I had a few drinks with friends the night before in the hopes that it would help me sleep. That's my excuse for going out and drinking, anyway. Still, couldn't fall asleep until at least 4 AM. I'm glad my internal clock was working and I wasn't awoken by the doorbell.   Robynn was on time and I was out of it but ready. Two large suitcases, a box containing my G4, another with the corresponding studio monitor and one more with books and miscellaneous stuff that David and I would need.   The first leg of the trip was to Philadelphia which was good in the way that I could go to the domestic terminal and not have to get there as early. Still, I had to deal with all the extra baggage which cost me $330. Ouch. I was to have a few hours in Philly before leaving for Paris but as the plane approached, there was "extreme" weather conditions and the plane was diverted to Harrisburg where we were to refuel and wait until things cleared up. It was 5:15 by the time we left Harrisburg. It's only a twenty minute flight to Philly but then there is all the waiting for slow ass people to get their shit and get off the plane. Unfortunately, they didn't allow people with connecting flights to deplane first. I was pretty far back on the plane so I had to wait which I did impatiently. Basically, I wanted to kill. I ran from concource C to A, occasionally stopping on the moving walkways to ask someone to get the fuck out of the way and stay to the right if they were just going to stand there. In actuality I was nice and polite but in my lind I was yelling at them to get the fuck out of the way and wondering if that was their first time in an airport and on a moving walkway. I made the plane. Everyone had already boarded. Then we proceeded to wait on the tarmac for an hour or so. Not even close to a full flight so I got to sit alone which is always nice.     Finally arrive in Paris and wait to get my passport stamped. I got in the slow line - probably because there were lots of Africans and other non-whites. After a while I got in a different line and it went relative quickly. Alright, get my baggage, meet up with David and Martin and I'm out of here. I wait and wait for the baggage. Nothing. The carousel belt stops for my flight. Shit. Was I at the right carousel? Did someone see that G4 box and take off with it? No No No. I got to the claim office and wait some more. Luckily I kept my claim tickets and my extra baggage receipt as it wouldn't have been unlike me to toss or lose that shit. Instead of my stuff I have a piece of paper and a number to call. Whatever, just get me outta here. Its been a long time now and I'm hoping David and Martin are still waiting. I get out in the terminal and they are no where to be found. OK. I'll call. I need money. I get in the line to change some money and it takes an incredibly long time. Me and this guy from Quebec who looked like the singer from Anthrax, the bald one with the long goatee, commiserated and wondered how simple math could take so long. I'd say another 40 minutes goes by before I get change but I do and now I have to call David's cell. None of the pay phones take change just phone cards. Fer fucks sake! Just as I'm about to blow a gasket, I see David and Martin who had been told the wrong gate and had themselves been waiting 2 h
