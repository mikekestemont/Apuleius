Welcome to my blog!  What a night to start blogging.  My mom will be in town tomorrow and my baby boy will turn 1 Wednesday. I would like to post a picture of the little cutie but I have yet to figure out how.  Keep checking back as I'm sure that I'll figure it out soon enough.  If all else fails I'll do what I know best, ask my husband!     So lately I've found that I needed an outlet for all the "stuff inside" and thought I could just blog it out.  That being said I don't even have a clue where to begin.  Life has been a bit of a test lately.  I'm feeling the need to start getting back to me.  You see, after the birth of my son I pretty much put myself on hold for the year.  Only recently have I felt the need to start taking myself back.  I'm finally in a position to take care of myself and my family simultaneously.  So the adventure begins...      I've always found summertime to be the time of year that I feel the most alive.  I seemingly have energy to do it all.  Lately that energy has been focused on remodeling our home.  We have almost completed a full paint job from ceiling to floor and now comes the adventure of baseboards.  I've opted for the traditional English look (5 3/4 board) which presents a challenge but will keep me from having to repair a one inch section of drywall above the standard 4 inch board.  The previous owners were kind enough to completely screw up everything they touched so each remodeling project is quite an undertaking.  I find myself repairing and then remodeling.  For instance, our guest bathroom.  The PO's painted the walls two different shades of the same color - this was an accident not an attempt at decorating.  They used a semi-gloss paint and then touched up with a high gloss.  You can only imagine how that looked.  They wallpapered a boarder across the top and used masking tape (which they left on the wallpaper) as a protector to paint the walls without getting the paint on the wallpaper.  That's right, they wallpapered and then painted.  After they were done doing that stellar job they continued onto repairing the caulking.  A white non paintalble caulk was used and smeared everywhere.  I've never seen such a job!  I've spent the past two months with a straight razor in my hand removing their caulk job.  I could go on for pages here but I'll finish with the real kicker and let your imaginations do the rest.  When they were painting the bathroom they PAINTED EVERYTHING.  Every door hinge, handle, locking mechanism, lightbulb etc had paint on it.  The door has so much that we are having to replace all the hardware as it won't shut properly.  Anyway, I've just realized that I've been ranting about the most absurd stuff and for those of you that are still with me I applaud your ability to stay interested in the mundane and welcome you to my favorite past time. Ranting tantrums about seemingly unimportant events.  Welcome to my blog!
Ha I say to the Bon Bon GODS! As I got in my car and headed to the gym I knew that I had a narrow window of opportunity to workout before my son would be hungry and ready for his morning nap and I was determined to burn off at least one layer of butt fat. As we arrived at the gym I noticed the entrance was blocked and there were a line of cars waiting to get in. Upon further investigation I realized that a gigantic flatbed semi with a back-ho resting on top was stuck on the driveway. The bottom of the truck had literally ground into the cement and was jammed. Brilliant! The gym is undergoing massive renovation so this explains the reason the truck was there in the first place however, he had managed to get stuck in just a way so to block all incoming and outgoing traffic through the only entrance/exit. At this time one begins to wonder how much determination and discipline they really have. Does one say fine, guess I just wasn't meant to workout today and I didn't really want to anyway? - which is what I did several times in my head while waiting in hopes for one of the construction workers to render the situation hopeless. No... I didn't succumb to this easy way out. Connor and I sat patiently for about 20 minutes waiting. Other moms desperate for a break from their little ones and in hopes of returning to their "pre-pregnancy size" sat with me getting more desperate by the minute. Some gave up and sped away agitated at the whole situation while a few sat unified thinking that somehow if we stare hard enough our piercing laser eyes would burn holes unto the flatbed truck and it would miraculously move. No you may be wondering, why didn't you just find alternative parking. Well it's difficult to explain but the gym sits next to a field on one side, train tracks, and has the back of a neighborhood on the other (literally the privacy fence so no parking here). My option was to park across the street down an alley and jaywalk across a busy four lane street with no crosswalk. So after giving up on the hopelessly comical situation that's just what I did! As I ventured toward the gym I could feel the victory smile creeping across my face. Once again I beat Mr. Procrastination and Mr. I don't have enough time. One more day that I can mark down as a cardio success story. I got Connor settled into the daycare and headed off to the treadmill only to realize I had left my headphones at home. Guess I still need to work on conquering Mr. Opps I forgot!  oh and just a little footnote... as I pounded away on the treadmill I watched t
