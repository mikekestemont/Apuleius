Even though I don't blog much, I have 3 blogs!
Today there was an earthquake in Northern Morocco. According to CNN there were at least 564 dead as of Tuesday Morning. My family is ok I assume, they live a few hundred miles south of the epicenter. The quake occured at about 2:28 a.m. with a magnitude of 6.5. The people who died were peasants living mud huts in rural villages near the city of Al-Houceima.  Life is strange. I wonder why I have been spared the many tragedies that occur daily. It only reaffirms my desire to live my life to the fullest.
I finally have this blog looking somewhat decent and with comment abilities too. Obviously I'm a newbie. Anyway, David Martinez said my first entry was boring. Now, YOU can tell me how boring it is, just click on the "Comment" button... Henceforth, I will try to keep my posts interesting or not post at all. Some possible future topics are: Illegal Immigrants, Favorite Trance DJ's, Casablanca, Moroccan Fossils, Valentines, Theological impressions, Dating, Keith Green, Favorite Fruits, How to make the best tasting tacos and guacamole.
I just got home from work. I made a song on my computer with Reason 2.5 (the 20 minute Demo version). It's a musically limited song, just a cool and heavy house/break beat with a repetetive acidic bass line in C minor. I like it. It sounds tight. The 2 bar loop still plays in the background, and it will continue to play until I press the (Quit) button reminding me that I could only play for 20 minutes. Nobody will have ever heard my song. (Unless Esteban gets home soon).  At least I got to practice my guitar and play along to the infectious beat. Eventually, I'll buy the software. Maybe when 3.0 comes out. I sense that now is not the time. I need to save my money, prioritize, whatever.  This is my first web-log ever. The concept is still pretty amazing to me.

I stood near a house on a street that was a mix between Lark and Bruce Ave. I heard screams and saw two Mexican young ladies who were running frantically. I intuitively knew that they were trying to escape a man who was bent on killing them. I told them to come with me and led them behind the house. By now the house was my Grandfather's old house  on Bruce. The house was really only a dilapidated frame, a suggestion of what once was and obviously not a good hiding place so I led the two girls to the neighbor's lot (the Denmans).  I could hear the fury of the guys chasing her. Their leader was an overweight Mexican "Cholo" who was carrying a huge black shotgun. Yelling and cursing, he let off some rounds which were overwhelmingly loud. I tried to dial 911 on my cell phone but it wouldn't work. I then tried adding a one and dialed 1-911, but that didn't work either. I looked up and saw the fat gangster cross the street towards our lot. They were on the other side of the house so I told the girls to hurry up and run to the front door neighbor's without being seen. Amazingly, they ran across and the fat Mexican didn't see them.  At this point a white lady was walking by and she called 911. Rick Trevino (an older friend of mine) also showed up and called the police. Both of their phones worked fine whereupon Rick explained that my phone needed a special code in order to work with the emergency number.  Rick then helped me grab my things (I only specifically remember my guitar) and we left my grandfather's house at which point the dream was over.
I dreamt that Buttons was growing weak. He was very skinny and could not eat. I put a mouse in his vivarium and Buttons attacked but wasn't able to suffocate the mouse as he normally does. Then, Buttons became only head and tail, no body inbetween. He looked like a fat, fin-less fish. ..... In real life, Buttons is about 5 feet long and 2.5 inches thick (thicker when recently fed). He is a ball python that my sister adopted then gave me for my birthday. I feed him a rat about once a month. My snake is beautiful but most people don't think so. I don't care, I love seeing people's reactions when they see my snake... I don't know why, but most people are afraid.  For example, this past Sunday, I was playing Guitar in the front yard with Esteban and we saw a Cholo ride up in a truck. He was a norteño -holding his red-rag in hand one hand as he stepped out of his car trying to look 'hard'. Then he saw me, with buttons and his whole demeanor changed.  From across the street, he called out to me "Is that a snake?"  "yeah..." I explained.  The young man, probably my age (23), came close to check out Buttons. He was scared and I thought to myself, how funny -a norteño is afraid of a snake. I also was somewhat disturbed by his red-rag. He seemed like a nice guy and I felt sorry that he was choosing gangs, either as a lifestyle or as a 'poser'. I wish I had asked him his name. Maybe I'll see the guy again. Who knows.

I keep messing up my blog! I need to stop changing the template every time I do a blog!
My father was born 52 years ago on May 23rd. We just talked to him on the phone and we ended up waking him up.  One of the coolest things I remember about my dad is how he used to listen to me practice my p
