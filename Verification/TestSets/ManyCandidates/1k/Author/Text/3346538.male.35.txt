I don't want to sound like I am some pinko commie by having this blog that is mostly about the bad things the Bush administration has done.  I really do support our troops.  I, like almost everybody in the U.S., have had relatives who fought in wars.  Some didn't come home alive.  We have it easy in this country and we have our military to thank for that.  Our soldiers have been asked to do a lot in these past few years and they have done it well.  The war in Iraq may not be the most popular war we have had but it isn't the fault of the men and women in the armed forces.  I may not agree with the Bush Administration's decisions about the war but I feel strongly that our soldiers are doing a good job in Iraq as well as in Afghanistan.  We have a volunteer military and they not only risk their lives for little money but it takes a horrible toll on their families as well.  I have included a  urlLink web site that honors our fallen soldiers .  I have also included a way to support the families of the wounded soldiers through an organization called  urlLink Fisher House .  I am going to enjoy this extended weekend with my family. The fighting in the middle east isn't going to stop this weekend. I don't want to forget why we have this holiday.
It seems Like fortress Bush is cracking a bit more.  Carl Bernstein, who co-authored the book All the Presidents Men with Bob Woodward, wrote  urlLink a very good editorial  about how the Republicans should do the honorable thing and ask Bush to step down as they did to Nixon.    Speaking of Republicans and honor(or lack there of)....Bill Frist the Republican senate majority leader was campaigning against Tom Daschle the Democratic senate minority leader in Daschles home state (one of the Dakotas)this past weekend.  Big deal you say, well I guess there is an unwritten rule that senate leaders do not do this in support for bipartisan cooperation.  This has raised many eyebrows even from prominent senate Republicans.  There is more discord in the senate this week as the  urlLink Bush administration tries to push its budget through congress .  There are four senate Republicans who say they will not vote for the bill because of the tax cuts Bush wants to keep for many years.  Senator John McCain (R-Arizona) argued that there has never been tax cuts during wartime in our nations history.  Tax cuts would look good for a reelection though.  McCain says that the republican party used to stand for fiscal responsibility but not anymore.   urlLink Retired General Anthony Zinni said  in a 60 minutes interview that he believed that this Pentagon really botched up the war in Iraq.  I know it seems like I like to pick on the president but I'm trying to show people that it's not just Michael Moore, Al Franken and other noted liberals who dislike Bush it's many people who normally would like a Republican candidate who have grown to dislike him.  Neocons say the media is out to get Bush.  I say there are a lot of people like Richard Clarke, General Zinni and former ambassador Joseph Wilson, who normally lean to the right, that are fed up with the lies and the arrogance of the Bush administration.      One last thought on the Bush administrations ineptitude to run a war.   urlLink As you may have read , Ahmad Chalabi is out of the Bush Houses' good graces.  His offices and home were raided last week because they suspect that he was giving intelligence to Iran.  He also has given the U.S. intelligence for millions of dollars.  Mr. Chilabi was one the sources telling Bush that the Iraqi people will line the streets to Baghdad with flowers.  It turns out that Mr. Chilabi was not trusted by no other department in our government except by top officials under Bush.
The Guardian in London has a  urlLink special commentary from Michael Berg  who's son, Nick, was the victim of beheading by al Queda terrorists.  I hope our leaders read it.    I was working on a computer at my union hall last week when another instructor logged on to one of the web sites that shows the horrible video of the beheading.  I could not watch it but the sounds still haunt me.  My thoughts were of how terrifying it must have been for Nick and how his parents must feel.  The comments from the other instructors were just as terrifying.  "Bomb the whole damn country and get it over with", one of the teachers said.  I have heard this before at work.  Bomb the whole damn country.  I am sure someone in al Queda has said the same thing about our country.  It is amazing that people still can't differentiate the Arab people who fly airplanes into buildings and who decapitate innocent people from the Arabs who raise children, go to work and want to live in peace.  Bomb the whole damn country.  That is what Osama bin Laden and his fellow terrorists want to do to us.  They view all Americans as infidels so we all should die.  There are some people in our country who view all Arabs as terrorists and that they too should die.  I just hope it is a minority of our people who are this narrow minded just as it is a minority of middle eastern people who are also.
Not that anything will come of this but the  urlLink L.A. Times is reporting  that Republican senators in the armed services committee are not happy about being in the dark about the prison abuse in Abu Ghraib.  They are going to look into this matter further.  They are going to focus on higher level Pentagon officials.  This is a story that won't die.  The New Yorker and Newsweek are both printing articles suggesting that Rumsfeld had secret orders to abuse Iraqi detainees.
