I have no idea how this actually works... can anyone read my posts?  I have enabled browsing or something like that.  I'm confused.  Oh well.  If you are reading this, and find any of my posts interesting, feel free to e-mail me at samuel.wilkin@westminster.org.uk  I did Kung Fu today.  Master Lee was away so Old Jon took it... that was very funny.  We did mainly forms and traditional stuff - Martial Arts can be either Traditional or Modern, or both.  Traditional styles involve mainly forms and workign on low stance-work, whereas a more modern style will focus more on the competition sparring or practical self-defence.  We practise both sparring and forms at our club, but the feel of it is distinctly traditional.  Stance-work, however, is not just to look pretty - they strengthen not only the muscles in the legs, but internally strengthen the bones and joints, producing similar results to Thai boxers kicking trees, without the bone cancer most Thai boxers develop by the time they are 30.  I have heard stories of men in China who practise traditional Kung Fu not as a sport, but as a way of life.  You get 70-year old men who look 50, and 90-year olds who can still run around.  This if nothing else is a reason to practise Traditional Martial Arts, as I have seen the life of a 90-year old through the eyes of my grandmother, and it is not pleasant.  Even the great majority of middle aged people in this country are overweight.  I simply could not live with myself not being in good shape - for me it is essential for my concentration and general happiness.  Perhaps all that will change in a few years, but I hope not.  I intend to live every minute of my life to the full.  What a cliche!  But by that I do not mean clubbing, drinking and smoking, as most people who say that mean, for that is only living the first portion of your life to the full.  I intend to enjoy my early years while still knowing that I am in good shape and have a good outlook on the future, so that old age will be something to enjoy as much as my youth.
Revised Latin today, for my GCSE on Tuesday.  Involved reading Pliny.  His view of the chariot racing is interesting:  'So I wonder all the more that so many thousands of grown men so childishly desire repeatedly to see horses running and men standing in chariots.  And yet if the were attracted either by the speed of the horses of the skill of hte men, there would be some logic in it; in fact they support a piece of cloth, they adore a piece of cloth, and if in the race itself... this colour were to be transferred to that horse and vice versa, their enthusiasm and favour will transfer as well'  This piece has always struck me as very relevant to football (or soccer to you Americans) in modern England.  I have sat through too many physics lessons where the conversation soon turns to football, and then swiftly to argument.  An Arsenal supporter calls another guy an idiot for supporting Chelsea, on account of their being 'crap', and the Chelsea supporter swiftly ripostes by calling the other a retard.  These are supposed to be 16-year olds.  It has always struck me as unnecessary.  Now I am not averse to watching a good game, in any sport.  However, these people are having fierce arguments in support of clubs to which they have seemingly no relevant connection.  Normally they are not the 'local' club, rather the most local club that is near the top of the Premier League - Chelsea or Arsenal.  The other side of the argument is, of course, that a club is made by its supporters, and it couldn't get anywhere without them.  This I appreciate, but I do not agree that this is the case with glory supporters such as those of Chelsea and Arsenal.  Football seems to have ceased to be 'the beautiful game', and has become a sort of one-up-man-ship.
Well, here is my first post.  I dunno what to say really.  So much to say, nothing that I can be bothered with.  Currently right in the middle of GCSEs.  As for next year, I still don't really know what to do.  I dropped history for GCSE, but now really regret it, want to take it up again, which my school offers.  I also want to do Maths, Spanish, French and Latin.  I can only do four, unless I do French out of block.  But I am boring you all with details.  University I dunno what to do either.  I would love to study Chinese, simply because I would want to go there and generally love the culture (and the kung fu!).  Also a very important place in terms of world politics etc.  Still, that is a dream, and I still do not know if i can realise it.  In a couple of years, my ambitions may have changed - I had completely different ambitions at different stages in my childhood, although this one seems more permanent.  I probably want to Cambridge University, although apparently SOAS in London is very good for Chinese.  I'm always doing this - right in the middle of my GCSE's and I'm dreaming of the future.  That is all for today, will probably post tomorrow. P.S.  For a pic of me, go to http://www.hotornot.com/r/?eid=OQESNMA&key=HJK where I'm pretending to be 18!  :P
A couple of days ago I called my ex-gf.  I hadn't spoken to her in 2 months.  In fact, I never really phone any old acquaintances.  All my phone calls tend to be stricly 'business-like' e.g. 'are you training tonight' or 'do you want to go out to dinner' (ok, so not technically business, but they have a motive).  And so I ask myself why, when I am bored, do I not casually call friends?  I have thought of a few potential reasons:  1.  I have only j
