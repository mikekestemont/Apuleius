Break out the calculator  So I just read down the page some and realized Justin calculated out 20 years into minutes...I am resisting the very strong engineering urge to break out my cheap CASIO (with graphical menu!) and check units....no....put down the calculator....  Thank goodness we have Kami on board to balance us out some...John Cusack would only improve the ratio.  In other news, the zipper on my jacket seems to be stuck...it's going to be a very warm day....
Justin says I should use my bored time to post another blog entry, so here goes:  There's something on my mind, so now it's going in this blog.  Hopefully, the person about which I'm gonna write will never read this cuz that could be somewhat embarassing.  On Wednesday, I was leaving work, and so I headed to the elevator.  There was a guy standing at the elevator, and he introduced himself to me.  Let's call him "A."   Anyhow, we had a very nice talk as we left the building.  Eventually A and I parted ways because we had to catch buses at different places.  That night, I was looking around Friendster, and who do you think I saw?  That's right, "A!"  What a crazy coincidence, huh?    Anyhow, I've been hoping all day to run into him, but it seems unlikely cuz I very rarely see people from the other offices on the floor.  I've even taken a couple more elevator trips than usual today.  So I have a little crush, and I might even consider asking A out (I know from his Friendster profile that he's single) if only I would see him again.  But I've been working at Odyssey for 3 months and I've only seen him maybe 3 times, with Wednesday marking our first conversation so the odds don't seem very good.  Ah, the trials of romance....
My Turn Again?  Sorry I haven't been participating too much.  Things have been super-busy at work.  Also, my sister is visiting from Australia, so we spent the first portion of the week cleaning, and we'll be spending the last portion of it entertaining.  By the way, I'm totally in favor of having John Cusack as a co-blogger.  Now, Justin, all you have to do is get him to agree.  And now I'm gonna go add this site as a link on my other blog.    I just have to add, after "Friends" ends this year, NBC is going to have a spin-off about Joey! It'll be interesting to see if it succeeds (like "Frasier") or flops.  I like Joey, so I hope it does well.  How you doin?
TWFL  In response to a post on the message board by someone who reads more blogs than he updates....hmm, I guess that's all of us....  Freshman year I lived at the Clark Kerr dorm 30 miles from campus (ok, so it was only a 15 minute walk, but hey, I drove to class in high school).  My roommates were Jennifer and the Invisible Woman (ie, she was never there.  So Jennifer and I had a really big double)  Down the hall were Justin and his roommates, and downstairs were Kami (and her roomates) and Noah (and his).  We mingled, watched movies, avoided homework, dyed our hair, and redefined the term "hall sports" together.  Towards the end of that year, we attended a presentation on finding off-campus housing, as everyone was getting kicked out of the dorms (Berkeley has this policy of admitting more students than it can provide dorm space for).  Here we were, innocent, naive, sheltered....and being kicked out into the cold, cruel world of no rent control.  What else could we do but band together, put together a housing resume (I think I may still have a copy), and trek out the to far reaches of space (northside) to search for a slightly larger cardboard box.  In the end, after paying a hefty sum of money and seeing more than our fair share of 2 bedroom apartments trying to pass off as 4 bedroom, Jennifer, Justin, Noah, and I found a house on Francisco Street.  A house being taken over by ivy (and rats a few years later), but a house nonetheless.  A drafty, dark, scary house, but...anyways.  This being only 20 minutes away from campus by walking was considered quite a find (if not an excellent exercise program when you forgot your homework at home)  Kami had taken the other path and become an RA, with housing provided and more freshman than you could shake a stick at.  She had also become involved in an organization known as the Third World Liberation Front (those of you at Intel will be relieved to hear it was abbreviated to a FLA - TWLF) (Those of you not Intel-ified, FLA is my remake of TLA, which, (are you ready?) stands for "Three Letter Acronym").  Memory fails me here, but I believe there were some overnighters spent on campus in protest.  Somehow, someone (coughcoughNoah) renamed this effort TWFL (pronounced "Twiffle").  This was so irritating that it somehow became the name of our house.  And so a house named with capital letters and still outside the Greek system (logistically and geographically) was born.  And that my friends, is what TWFL means.  To 5 kids from Berkeley :)
> John Cusack for Co-Blogger!   If you haven't heard, there was a "big" (meaning a few hundred bored college students) push on some college campuses to have  urlLink John Cusack run for President of the United States . I even printed out the poster for his campaign and posted it on my wall. Though, it turns out that Cusack (sometimes I like to think he would like me to call him John), doesn't want to run for president. He states,  urlLink "Yeah, it's pretty galling. But it would probably be a good idea -- if it wasn't me." . I don't presume to know Cusack's inner thoughts, but I could see how he would have no desire to mess around with such an ugly, and almost worthless, game. After all politics has been c
