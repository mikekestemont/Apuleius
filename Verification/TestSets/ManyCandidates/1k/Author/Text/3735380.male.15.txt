"Michael, vacuum the carpet." "Michael, fix the remote." "Michael, clean the rat cages." "Michael, sweep the driveway." "Michael, do the dishes." "Michael, take the dog for a walk"  Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! This is crazy. You can't expect me to do everything. It's summer. Time to relax. Imperative sentences are supposed to be gone, along with school.  I already have a job. I get paid. It's not my fault that I requested hours and didn't get any.  And what am I getting paid for these chores? $0.00 a year.  That 's gonna buy me a car. When I did a cruddy job on sweeping the driveway, I yelled back to my dad, "You get what you pay for", and that got him. I still had to sweep the rest anyway.  "But it's simple." Then do it yourself.  All I ever wanted to do today was sit and play Golden Sun on my GameBoy. I managed to play about 4 hours of it, and 1 hour of reattempting failed sidequests. But that was for the entire time of today. The other 5 hours I was forced to do something else.  It was a long morning too. My brother yanked the covers off me to wake me up at 11:00. That got me in a great mood to beat him up this morning.  Basically, I was ticked the entire day. In the game, I was stuck against Saturos on the Mercury Lighthouse aerie. That's when the batteries ran out.  So what happened that actually went right today? Let's recap for a minute. 1. I'm still alive.  Is that a good thing or a bad thing? Let's wait and see.
Day two of the demolition. I don't know why they do that in the morning instead of the afternoon. Today I woke up at about 12:00 with them crushing what was already knocked down.  The morning—err, you know what I mean—was a drag.  Then my mom practically forced me to sit in the sun for 10 minutes. I guess I should have told her about photons (my second last blog). Anyway, I got a very light tan, hardly noticable., nothing big.  The rest of the afternoon was a drag.  Next thing we did, my brother's 8-year-old friends were going to see the movie "Dodgeball". Like that would teach them any life lessons. Note my sarcasm.  Anyway, after a phone call, I gave in. My mom threatened it was either Dodgeball or Two Brothers. I completely gave in and said Dodgeball. They won't follow the movie anyway. All they enjoy is throwing popcorn in people's hair.  Throwing popcorn? I meant flicking popcorn, and I was the main target, until I sat behind them. Great movie. Three stars, and that's actually good, because I've only twice given a four star rating. Pirates of the Carribean and Spiderman I.  Anyway, we went to my brother's friends house. They played dodgeball. Typical after a movie like that. I chased the dog when she jumped out of the car. At least I got some exercise.  After all that, I finally came home and wrote this blog. My parents are still trying to make me read my summer books. I say not until July. But they always find a way.
Today my sleep was ended abruptly by the deconstruction site across the street.  The owner of the house died last August. It's been due for demolition for a while now.  But 7:00? Some people are sleeping! It's summer. That's what we're supposed to do during summer break: sit in a chair for 12 straight hours and sleep for 12 straight hours. It's life.  I woke up and watched the demolition anyway. I even felt sonic vibrations like an earthquake at one point.  When the house went down, I went straight to sleep. That didn't last long.  At 9:30 I had to wake up for an orthodontist appointment. I broke four brackets on my braces and needed them fixed. 9:30am? Why not 2:30pm when I'm awake?  So much time, so little sleep.
There is usually something abnormal about every week at work. This is the third time this week something weird happened. That is rare.  My mom is really beginning to complain that I'm not tan enough. "You need dark skin to attract ladies.", "You look anemic.", "A tan would get you some popularity, or a girlfriend.", or my favorite: "When we go on our vacation, you're going to get real bad sunburn."  Who needs that? My skin is perfect as a slightly pale white. I don't need a tan. I'm one of those people who look bad with one. I'm just a regular pale-skinned friendly person. Maybe a little gold would work, but mainly I look perfectly normal with this skin color.  Usually we're dead on Sundays. Until about 5:30, we were. People then came in waves of about 5 separate groups each. Probably a baseball game across the street.  Near the end of the day, about 6:30, this group of 6 girls came in. They seemed a little nervous about me. They bought food and sat down.  15 minutes later, my supervisor let me take the night off. 15 minutes early isn't much, but it's enough time to eat my meal, and I was thankful for that. I clocked out and sat down next to and facing the side door, as I always do.  I finished my food, fries, and the group of girls passed me. They said "Hey, sexy!" and giggled. I almost jumped.  So much for my mom's advice. Look what a tan would  lose  me. I guess my skin color is fine with what I had now.  It's not time to get my ego all flared up because of that, but it really is an interesting situation. Maybe I don't need a tan. Maybe they're just joking.  Whatever it was, it sure was surprising.
So unfortunate events can lead to a major freakout? Let's hear it. Saturdays have lots of bad juju. Care to let me explain? It's a really verbose explanation. Read it only if you h
