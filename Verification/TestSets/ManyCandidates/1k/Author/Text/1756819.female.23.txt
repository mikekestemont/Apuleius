There are some pretty strange sayings out there.  For instance, "I have ants in my pants."  Now of course I don't have ants in my pants at all, but rather am feeling restless and unsettled.  I can just imagine what it would be like to have ants in my pants...itchy and uncomfortable (not to mention a little creepy).  I suspect that my current state of antsiness has to do with the fact that I'm looking forward to a long weekend and I'd rather be outside enjoying what little sun there is today.  I just hope that the ants leave me in peace for a while so that I can get some work accomplished today.
Got my first  urlLink digital pictures  up.  These ones are from Tuesday night (the 26th) when my roommate and I went to Guam and Hoort's to watch the Two Towers on Hoort's new TV.
Around this time of year I always get the urge to go out and buy school supplies.  Or at least wander through the aisles in the store.  There is nothing like getting new pens, pencils, paper, notebooks, etc.  As a kid, every summer I would wait in anticipation for the flyers to come out with the sales for school supplies.  Then I would sit at the table with my paper and pen and scour over all the deals making detailed notes about where each item could be found and for how much.  Not only was I excited to be getting new stuff for school, but I was also excited to be going back to classes.  I even looked forward to the homework and reading.  But now that I have completed my formal education I have no more need for school supplies...and yet the urge remains.  Maybe it's a sign. I can feel the classroom calling me...
Well, I'm back from my whirlwind visit to Ontario.  I left work around 3 pm on Friday, drove 7 hours home and arrived in Cameron about 10:30 pm.  Chatted with my family for a bit, saw the new kittens (only a week old) then went to bed.  Saturday was the Wilson picnic.  All my mom's aunts, uncles, and cousins get together every summer for a potluck picnic and games.  It was a beautiful day and a good turnout.  I even got a little sunburnt.  After the picnic we stopped by my grandparents house for a quick visit and so my grandma could give me my birthday present.  Then home again to relax.  On Sunday I went to my home or my parents' church, whichever you want to call it.  Some of my high school friends were there, but not too many since most are out on their own too.  After church we went over to my Opa's house for coffee and more visiting.  Then we piled in the car and drove to Belleville for one of my cousin's baby shower.  We had a BBQ and cake and all kinds of goodies.  I also got to catch up with more family.  After the shower we drove back to Bowmanville where we had left my car and I headed back to Grand Rapids, and my parents and Opa headed home.    From the Fifth Wheel truck stop, I set out on 6 hour drive home.  The drive was uneventful except for the usual traffic in Toronto and the major traffic at the border.  It took me about 45 minutes just to get across the bridge and up to the gate.  Needless to say, that set me back an hour, and I got home later than I expected.  But was I glad to be home.  I went almost immediately to bed, and had no troubles sleeping.
I have decided that I like check lists.  While it can be daunting to list all the things that you have to do, it is very satisfying to check things off when they are complete.  Then you can look back over your list of things to be done and see how much you've accomplished.  A very good feeling.
I'm so excited, my camera arrived last night.  So I got to rip open the box, and unwrap packages and bags, manuals, etc.  Then I had to charge up the battery so I could actually play around with the settings and stuff.  After a  very  long hour the battery was charged, the memory installed and I was ready to rock and roll.  I took some random pictures of our living room and then tried some closeups of mine and a friend's face.  There are so many settings that I still have to read about, but what fun!  It's like Christmas :)  I also installed the software to download the pictures from my camera to my laptop.  One more thing to learn about and play with :)  Perfect timing too, now when I go home for a little visit I can take pictures with my new camera.  Can't wait :)
Life is a miracle.  Last night my roomie were watching Maternity Ward on TLC.  An hour of pregnant mothers coming to the hospital and having their babies.  I know, it sounds kinda corny...but watching the mothers and doctors really drove home both the resilience and the fragility of life.  Some babies were normal and healthy, but others had problems that made birth very difficult.  One little girl with Spina Bifida had a sack of spinal fluid on her back that forced the doctors to perform a C-section.  They didn't want to break the sack and harm the baby.  Another little girl had a portion of her small intestine that developed outside her belly button.  Both babies underwent surgery and both came out happy and healthy.  Amazing.  Without modern medicine those babies would have died.  Life is too miraculous to be taken for granted.
I want this week to go by fast.  Not because I'm waiting for though the weekend (though that is partially true as well), but mainly because I want to play with my new camera.  Last night I went to Best Buy and bought myself a digital camera to replace my old o
