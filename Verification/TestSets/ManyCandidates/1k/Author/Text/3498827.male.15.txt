Say hi to your fair feathered friends for a duck may be somebodies mother be kind to your friends in the swamp where the weathers dark and damp!   A Poem I wrote: (in french)   Sang Le cramoisi déchire tomber des yeux de celui dont l'âme a été brisée
Guess what? Never, On the first time you have rollerbladed, go down a really steep driveway. Especially If theres a car at the end of it. It hurts, trust me. Just for the record- I will be keeping this blog up until i get my own website.
When a really hot girl thinks you're cute, dont tell your mother that she is cute. Your mother will make a big deal out of it and tell absolutely EVERYONE about it. The girl will most likely not lke you any more. I learned that the hard way. Also- never dress a 17 year old guy in makeup with huge persian eyes and a green dress. Its just plain wrong. Especially when He stands up on stage and goes "I'm the RopeHolder! HUH-DUH-DUH! Take my word for it. Its Disturbing. I will put a picture up if I can find one (and figure out how to post it) Ok, I gotta go. I'll post again later. Now- to catch gummi fish with a gummi Worm!
I have recently decided that one must not play with a lighter in ones pocket. My Jacket now has a bit of a burn in it. Also- dont try to light a sugarcube when you are holding it. It hurts. A Lot.
I can create a bomb that will let me take over the world. The process is quite simple, and you can use objects you find around he house. Ingredients: 10 pickles 10 "C" batteries 20 6 inch pieces of copper wire 1 globe of the earth 10 gallons of bleach 1 rather large microwave a spool of string  1. Tie the string onto the pickles and dip in bleach, let sit for 1 hour 2. Take bleached pickles and Insert wires onto both sides of all them. 3 attach other end of the wires to batteries creating 10 electronated pickles 4.open globe and place jumble of electronated pickles into it. 5. fill the rest of the globe with the remaining bleach 6. close globe and place into the microwave. 7. microwave on high for 56 minutes, no more, no less  This will create an explosion that will destroy all of canada and most of japan. Alaska will be left floating on the ocean and will become its own continent (like australia) The fumes left over from the blast will brainwash the rest of the world, causing them to do what i want. However, the only way to control the masses is to take a Nintendo 64 controller, attach it to another bleached pickle bomb, and use it like you would any Nintendo game. The A button is jump and the B is attack. you can assign different actions to the C buttons.  That is my ultimate plan.
Ok. this is my first post on my blog. I hope someone actually cares. Nobody does. Oh well. I am here to answer all your questions, along with my buddies Haz_mat And Falldog_gothic. Ummmmm..... I'l post again when i have something good.
