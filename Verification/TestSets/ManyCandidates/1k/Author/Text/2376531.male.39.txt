Particle systems have long been recognized as an essential building block for detail-rich and lively visual environments. Current implementations can handle up to 10,000 particles in realtime simulations and are mostly limited by the transfer of particle data from the main processor to the graphics hardware (GPU) for rendering.  This article introduces a full GPU implementation of both the simulation and rendering of a dynamically-growing particle system. Such an implementation can render up to 1 million particles in real-time on recent hardware. It helps you to dramatically increase the level of detail and allows you to simulate much smaller particles. Thus it goes back again towards the original idea of a particle being a minimal geometry element.  The massively parallel simulation of particle physics on a GPU can be a flexible combination of a multitude of motion and position operations, e.g. gravity, local forces and collision with primitive geometry shapes or texture-based height fields. Additionally, a parallel sorting algorithm is introduced that can be used to perform a distance-based sorting of the particles for correct alpha-blended rendering.    urlLink Gamasutra - Features - "Building a Million-Particle System"
July 28, 2004   Sony Profits Soar Despite PlayStation 2  Sony officials have surprised the market by posting an unexpectedly large profit for its first quarter, as the weakness of the yen boosts the value of overseas sales.  The company announced a group profit of ¥23.3 billion ($208.4m) in the three months ended June 30 – a huge increase on last year’s figure of ¥1.1 billion ($9.8m) and well above market expectations of around ¥4 billion ($35.8m).  However, the company’s game division slipped into the red with a recorded loss of ¥2.9 billion ($25.9m) for the quarter – hit by high research and development costs for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable. This result is likely to be a one off though, with software shipments actually increasing to 38 million world-wide, compared to 31 million at the same time last year.  Hardware shipments are well down to 0.71 million, from 2.65 million at the same time last year, but this is put down to a peculiarity in shipment timings and inventory shortages.  Officials have not altered the company’s full year estimates, which are expected to see an overall operating profit of ¥160 billion ($1.4bn), after discounting ¥130 billion ($1.2bn) in restructuring costs.

This is a good glossery for lighting terms you come across in papers.  urlLink Reflectance | Albedo | Diffuse Reflectance
Radiant intensity - is the radiant flux radiated from a point on a light source into a unit solid angle in a particular direction.   Radiance - Radiance is the radiant intensity per unit projected surface area, where projected surface area is the real surface area multiplied with the cosinus of the angle between the direction of the radiation and the surface normal. &nbsp;Standard unit of radiance is watts per steradian and square meter (W/sr&nbsp;m2)   Radiant exitance - is the total amount of radiative flux leaving a point on a surface into all directions above the surface.  Irradiance (usually Ei in formulas) is the total amount of radiative flux incident upon a point on a surface from all directions above the surface.  Reflectance / Albedo – the ratio of incident luminous flux upon a surface which is reradiated in the visual spectrum  Luminous - Emitting light, especially, emitting self-generated light (as opposed to reflected light).
HDR Summary Normal texture maps pre-scale and quantize the color of a surface. This in effect bakes in the amount of light the surface is reflecting, at some give time. Once lighting information is scaled and quantized, detail surface information can get lost, especially if the scale value used in the process is very small or large relative to the quantize range. All of this is bad because the amount of visible light that can be viewed reflecting off a surface can vary widely due to camera aperture settings and dynamic lighting. HDR textures solve this problem by storing the un-quantized reflectance attributes of a surface. The reflectance values stored in an HDR texture can be viewed as the ratio of incident light on the surface that will get reflected back. These values will range from very small to very large positive floating point values. The samples stored in an HDR/radiance map are typically relative to the average radiance in the scene.   Benefit summary Large range of light intensities can be reflected from a surface, and the surface will change appearance as it would in nature. &nbsp;An object can go from being dimly lit where not much detail is noticeable, to brightly lit where once hidden details will appear. For example, chiseled details would gradually appear on a dimly lit stone, as a player walked up to the stone carrying a torch.   Camera exposure lengths can easily be simulated, by using a simple function to scale the overall light intensities up or down. When reducing the aperture, and making everything darker, brightly lit areas will stay bright, and contrast in the scene will persist.   Dynamic Day / Night effects could be made easier with a system like this.  Blurring, blooming, reflection mapping all can benefit from HDR, as contrast between pixels is maintained during blend operations.  Texture Costs / Encoding Formats We will need 32 to 24 bits per pixel, not counting an alpha channel.   LogLuv24 The 24 bit LogLuv24 format requires extra processing to transform in to RGB space and may not be practical. &nbsp;It uses 10 bits for luminance, and 2, 7 bit indices for indexing color along with a 16K lookup table. The look up table would be the same for all LogLuv24 textures I believe.  RGBE The RGBE format is a 32 bit floating point format that uses 8 bits for a common e
