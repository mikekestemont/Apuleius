I just wanted to thank the King, Tom, for passing off his horrible "I don't want to do anything" syndrome to me!  Last night was fun but it was uneventful.  So now I don't feel like doing anything!  Grrr...if you find a cure let me know.
Anybody feel like doing anything tonight?  A movie, the Levee, Gameworks, Poker - which I learned how to play well last night against my dad, anything?  If so, holler!   Do not forget to entertain strangers, for by so doing some people have entertained angels without knowing it.   Hebrews 13:2
So, I wake up at 10, decent amount of sleep (7 hours), eat some breakfast, run, do a little cardio, shower, screw around on the internet, eat lunch, screw around some more on the internet, clean a bathroom and my room, and wallow in boredom.  Man, I love summer.
Do you feel love or a lack thereof?  Love is a bond without reason, a cry for connection, a light in your eyes. Love is a reason for living, a reason for trying, a reason for life.  Forget the feeling.  Forget all your reasons. Life is love or the lack thereof.  Love is a bond without reason, a cry for connection, a light in your eyes. Love is a reason for living, a reason for trying, a reason for life.  Love is everything.    Oh love, you move me. Love move in me. Love, move me. Love is everything.   Have you found a reason for you To change who you used to be A reason to start over new And the reason is...between you and God.  Nothing can change the way you feel.  You can't tell your heart what to do and what not to do.  You can't tell your heart not to hurt, because then it would never love.  Love hurts.  But life goes on.  Have a little faith in love.  Your hearts can handle more than you think.  And not every love hurts - like friendships.  They are the purest love you will ever find.  Embrace it.  Maybe all that true love will balance out the painful love.  Have a little faith boys.  Cyanide kisses happen to even the best of us.
I will win this battle against my parents.  More so my dad, but whatever.  I am 18, I'm responsible, I'm an adult.  I should be able to do whatever I want to do.  So from now on, I'm just going to do it.  I don't care what it takes.  I want my life back.  I want to be able to see my friends whenever I want.  I understand that a curfew is still in order, and that is fine by me.  But I am setting my own rules now.
Ok, I am totally with the Fresh Prince (and DJ Jazzy Jeff) on this one...parents just don't understand.  I am so tempted to just leave my house and live out of my car right now.  I've got to get out of this prison that has become my home!  I must admit, recently, I did win a small battle in that I am going to Louisville, but seriously, what is so wrong about wanting to have a social life?  Everybody's doing it Dad.    Dad, he's driving me crazy...I just want to ERR! punch something.  I'm really trying not to cuss here but it is quite difficult.  Last night we fought for 3 hours about me going to Louisville and this morning we fought for an hour about a map.  Not kidding.  A fuckin' map!  He said that the baseball fields were directly lined up with Nunn Hall at NKU's campus or some shit.  I said they weren't, and in my defense, which I technically don't need to defend anything because I was right, I think I know NKU's campus just a little better than him.  He went off for 30 minutes about how he was right because he's never wrong...I don't know, I wasn't listening because I knew I was right.  I lived there all summer, dammit, I would know.  All he had to do was pick my sister up from a volleyball camp.  That was it.  It was the first time he's had to pick a kid up since I've had my license and he bitches at me about directions and the inaccuricies of a rough sketch of a map that I drew?  Let's grow up just a little bit, ok?  More to come...
Today was a sad day.  First thing I heard when I woke up was that my baby cousin, just born on Wednesday, died this morning.  She wasn't breathing.  Her heart had stopped.  One day old.  She only made it one day in the world.  It made me think.  How was that supposed to fit into God's plan?  I still have faith in him, but it just seems so cruel.  My aunt is beside herself, and her four children too.  Not to mention my uncle.  They had already brought the baby home.  Everything was fine.  Audrey was fine.  Why did she have to die?  I didn't even get to see her.    But she has to be in a better place right?  In the arms of God, eternally happy and warm and safe.  She has to be.  She was so innocent.  Born without sin.  She didn't have enough time to do wrong anyway.    I don't know what this means, or how it changes things, but it does.  Now Audrey is part of the past, a little bit of history that gives June 30 a whole new meaning.  She is safe now.  She's just waiting for us, with God.  I just hope His little plan works.  I still have faith.  I just hope that the grieving do too.
Life... well... I think it is pretty great right now.  I've done some of the most unthinkable things in the past couple of weeks.  I've become the youngest manager in our stores history, I've had the best sales week in history for my particular store, but most of all I've achieved an unbelievable mental goal.  It feels awesome!  I have never felt s
