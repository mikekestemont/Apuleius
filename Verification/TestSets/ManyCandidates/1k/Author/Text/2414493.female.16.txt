fiel: faith, in Spanish...I think I used to be fascinated by this kind of thing, but when it's this late and you're this out of it, yeah right
So Enid, I sure hope you're happy because this, my friends, is Lydia's blog.   It's Thanksgiving break, a Saturday night, and I have no consolation but to know that SNL starts in about ten minutes or so. It's also that time of year again when the Christmas music starts playing, the icicle lights are up and families are hauling trees home. And somehow I just feel like I'm so out of it.  Remind me never to have four days of freedom with just about nothing planned, eh? Life without a schedule, as hated as it is, can be hell.   Life as it is now: there's mink dittos scattered all around my desk, and I still haven't memorized digastric and masseter, much less the rest of the 30-odd mink muscles to go.   Mrs. Battaglia thinks that the people who keep journals could be serial killers. I beg to differ. I don't even know where this strange desire to meticulously record thoughts and actions comes from. Maybe it's from boredom, or just a plain lack of SOMETHING TO DO. Yeah, maybe that's it.  I think I have a piano recital in a week and I'm dreading it. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against piano but practicing and anticipating drives me nuts.  Oh, don't worry about it. I am very strange when I am candid.
I think I am so angry with myself I could go kill someone--maybe that someone is me.  Maybe I don't want to explain word for word, but let's just say that I have wasted my whole entire piano life. I just can't get it together, even for the smallest stupidest thing. I hate myself, i hate myself, i hate myself.  My whole entire week has been crap. I tutored for half an hour and didn't get paid jack, i had to spend so much time in journalism i had to cancel my driving lesson and spend an extra $20, and I don't know where that's going to come from. My week has been totally stolen from me. I couldn't spend Jess's birthday with her. I screwed up on the physio test. I screwed up on piano. I screwed up my whole entire life. I hate it. Why can't I ever do anything right?  I have had barely any time to myself this week. It's not fair--why can't I be normal? Why can't I get my $45 like I'm supposed to? Why can't I start feeling happy about Christmas, which is less than two weeks away? Maybe I'm just being selfish, but this year we have a smaller tree, and it's still unlighted. I have $40 right now for presents and all...some short time ago I had $90. I am going to spend two weeks moping, alone.  I've met one of Enid's friends online, Steve.
another thing: I weighed myself today. Maybe next time I should do it without baggy clothing because the good ol' Cal sweatshirt weighs a pound, more or less. WAY TO GO, SELF ESTEEM!
Dashboard Confessionals: "Standard Lines." I can't say I'm really into the emo/punk genre, and I only got into them because of big bro Nigel, but I like the guitar on this. I remember I had this stuck in my head for a good part of the summer.  So here I am, sitting at my desk, Bailey cracked open, doing a chapter summary. I know I'm supposed to be taking care of the term paper first, especially because it's due on Friday and I should probably work on it (I haven't touched it yet). But it's just one of those things where you know it's inevitable but you avoid it anyways. Or as long as you can.  Volunteering at the hospital yesterday. I honestly love it, no matter that it takes up three (usually four) hours of my time these days. It's one place where I can go about and be nice to everyone and nobody knows who I am during the school day. And it's just so nice to be helping people--the greatest are the discharges, where you know that your patient is happy to be going home and you can be happy with them. Isa was there, though, rescheduling. I can't believe how strict she is...maybe before I'd just never really come in contact with her in person before, and she was kind of snappy. Mercurial. So she gets on my case on how I'm not scheduled for Tuesday (what the hell? I talked to her about rescheduling to Tuesday) and made me temporary COD until Dan comes, etc. etc. I also snuck a peek at my hour log. It's kind of disconcerting...I saw that last month I had 12.5 hours (ok) and the month before was 8.something. I'm not sure. I just hope I had 100 or more by now, and I don't know if forgetting to sign out changes anything. I'm so stupid. I should take care of it, but I just forget to. I think I met a decent guy, but I'm pretty sure it's one of those little chimeras that disappear once you get to know them more. He goes to Moorpark, runs cross country, etc., and just got his permit before coming to the hospital Tues. He's mildly sarcastic (as opposed to very sarcastic) and spontaneous. I don't want to seem like a little subservient fool, though. If it works out, it works out. I'm not searching for that kind of thing anyways, but it's difficult to find decent people even when you're not looking at them beyond what they are to a normal passerby. Maybe I am picky, but I'll probably rethink it dramatically if I find out he's not exactly bright or if there's some other "fault" of his. I don't know. I'm not looking for anyone. And I really shouldn't care about this kind of thing right now.  "your hair/it's everywhere/screaming infidelities/and taking its wear"  Mock t
