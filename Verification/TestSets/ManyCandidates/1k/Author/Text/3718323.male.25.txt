He approached the beach and gave his legs a break from peddling, allowing a moment to enjoy the cool and gentle breeze which flowed through his sun drenched hair.  The smell of saltwater was in the air as the worn tires of his old bike rolled over the cracked concrete, producing a slightly noticeable whir.  Occasionally he glanced up at the swaying palm trees that stretched towards the sky, which still didn't seem real.  The streets were familiar, and the scene no different, but the experience was always new.  With a grand imagination it could easily be anyone's first time.    Later as he sat in the sand time stood still, and with the backdrop of ever present waves, memories were made.  The far away clouds hung over the mysterious blue water, grey and dreary, but the sun still shone overhead.  When he was there, it was all just a moment.  But time has no bounds, and everything etched itself into the past.  Though tomorrow was an eternity away, eventually things started to move, and with the right memories it is all recalled as he rides down a familiar street and glances up at the swaying palm trees stretching towards the sky, which still at times don't seem real.
There are some people that just seem  too  happy.  They appear to be perpetually optimistic, and I usually see them strolling around wearing big goofy smiles, always seeming to be have some degree of concern and interest in how I'm doing.  I give them a smile and say "hello", which somehow becomes an invitation for them to engage me in a brief dialog.  They ask how things are going, and I, in as nice a way as possible, complete the exchange.  I smile, walk away, and wonder.  And so the day goes in a series of these seemingly meaningless yet somehow necessary sets of interactions.  Some people are genuinely happy, truly concerned, and to all ends just  good  people.  They find good in most everything.  But can a person really be happy all the time?  Perhaps everyone should be ruffled by something from time to time.  At least it forces some degree of consideration.  It might even  urlLink be beneficial for everyone in the long run .
The idea of  urlLink simple living  has always been appealing to me.  Something about living a pure and simple life just seems so unburdened.  I bet that most of the time that people spend cleaning and organizing their homes could better be described as finding places to put useless crap.  I've experienced it in the past.  Organizing stuff that I can't remember the last time I used and putting it somewhere to ensure that I won't have to go through the same thing again.  Usually it is a perfectly good waste of space and time; time that could more enjoyably be spent doing anything, perhaps even nothing.  I'm not talking about the never bathing and walking around barefoot kind of simple, but just living within my means and not accumulating unnecessary and useless stuff.  Even in my own moderately frugal way of life, from time to time I decide that there's something I must have, and eventually I justify it and end up buying it.  And usually it just ends of being something I really could have done without.  Here in Southern California, many people have a hobby that they like to call shopping.  Those who approach life in this fashion (pun intended) usually are in no ways happier, are broke all the time, and for that still really don't have anything that cool.  So what does it accomplish?  Beats me.  Apparently it fulfills their immediate need for gratification which usually doesn't produce any sort of benefit in either the short or long term.  The other day I started reading a book about voluntary simplicity, and the most important thing I've learned so far about simple living in modern Western society is to not deny yourself a material existence, but instead to remove needless distractions, excess clutter, and complication.  Doing so allows a greater degree of focus on other important things, in turn leading to a more conscious and deliberate lifestyle.  As people yearn for more in the way of material goods, financial prosperity, and success, as they chase their version of the "American Dream", they find that it is unattainable, and they lose sight of what is important, becoming psychologically and spiritually hollow.  Their success ultimately becomes their demise.  I found a quote from Gandhi which says, "As long as you derive inner help and comfort from anything, you should keep it.  If you were to give it up in a mood of self sacrifice or out of a stern sense of duty, you would continue to want it back, and the unsatisfied want would make trouble for you.  Only give up a thing when you want some other condition so much that the thing no longer has any attraction for you."  Sounds like good words to live by.  On another note, today I drove by a parking lot with two telephone booths in it.  Both were in use and someone was actually waiting for one.  I didn't think anyone used phone booths anymore.
I was thinking today about what the appeal of a blog is.  I've always toyed with the idea of starting one in the past, but it seemed like it would just be a lot of extra work.  So far though, I've already been more successful with this than any previous journal attempt.    I think that writing allows me to harness my thoughts, and gives a certain focus to them that otherwise likely wouldn't be there.  Most of the time, I typically keep my thoughts closely guarded, and I think part of the allure is that in writing they can be let out.  Some of them at least.  It is a place to give my thoughts an anonymous voice, and where no judgement can be passed, or at least none that will affect me.  The thought of someone somewhere reading what I write and r
