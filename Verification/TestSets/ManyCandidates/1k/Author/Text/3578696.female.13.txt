hey you, you know you should probably add more to your page than pictures..i know you are busy sometimes but you should really post your thoughts so we know how you feel..take care lil girl and see you later.
My sister always makes me want to kill her!!!! She somtimes gets in trouble for punching me, but not in enough trouble. I can't believe I sometimes even feel sorry for her when she gets in trouble, but I won't any more! I am sick of the way she treats me! I want payback!!!

o i am so pissed off!!! p@$%^* #na man..now when i start cursing in tagalog..u know i'm pissed off..its just that i can't stand being lied to anymore by anybody. i'm so stressed out and i hate when people lie to you in your face it is just so stupid and they try to make you look like you are tanga but u know that you are better than that..personally i don't like being a first born because you always have to be the better person and never be selfish..goddamit! ba't ako palagi kailangan mag bigay! di naman ako mayaman no! but seriously i can't do anything about it my family is so wutever you cannot describe it in words what kind of crazy people my family is..but! see there is always that but, butting into my business..its that i love my family and i mean all of them..you can't hate them that long kc they are your family..you are stuck with them and you can't do anything about it...so all i can say it that you can't live with them, and you can't live without them!!! dum! dum! dum!
I don't know if anyone remembers this from a year ago, but this was my theme song of the year..don't ask me why i don't want to talk about it i just thought of posting one of the songs that gave me an outlet when i was not myself last year..it was just one of those things that you never want to talk about when those feelings fade out.  Yeah...it's been so long(oh) I find myself still thinkin' about you. Do you ever think about me?(ever think about me) Check this out girl  All those nights that we kissed  Are the nights that I miss  Holding hands as your man for sure  We were young but secure  What we had was so pure  Innocence ever since we spoke   Why do we fall in love  When love will only tear us apart  Back then world was ours Everything was so right(yeah)  But we were kissing with our eyes closed so tight  So young and feeling so right  Never thought that we could do wrong  Oh we were kissing with our eyes closed so tight  So young and feeling so right  I can't believe that those days are gone(Yeah,I miss you baby)  So much pride as my girl  Thought I showed you the world  Memories,you and me,so real(so real) Gave my heart and my soul  Made you sunshine from cold  All those days,far away from here  I still think about you,hear me out...  We danced so close, we held on tight(yeah)  I never knew that love could feel so right  We danced so slow, we danced all night(aah) Assuming that tomorrow would be bright  We kissed goodnight, you walked on by  The vision of your shadow caught my eye  My life stood still, you went inside  I never got the chance to say my last goodbye (say goodbye)   I still can't believe it(no no) After all this time(all this time)  I'm still missing you Damn, some things will never change...
When someone tells u this it just melts ur heart..after you and your significant other have parted ways..and i have heard many people say this or this was basically said to them..this is a song that gives you hope that there is someone "better" out there for you.  Somebody told me you were leavin’  I didn’t know  Somebody told me you’re unhappy  But it doesn’t show  Somebody told me that you don’t want me no more  So you’re walkin’ out the door  Nobody told me you’ve been cryin’  Every night  Nobody told me you’d been dyin’  But didn’t want to fight  Nobody told me that you fell out of love from me  So I’m settin’ you free   Let me be the one to break it up  So you won’t have to make excuses  We don’t need to find a set up where  Someone wins and someone loses  We just have to say our love was true  But has now become a lie  So I’m tellin’ you I love you one last time  And goodbye  Somebody told me you still loved me  Don’t know why  Nobody told me that you only  Needed time to fly  Somebody told me that you want to come back when  Our love is real again   Just turn around and walk away  You don’t have to live like this  But if you love me still then stay  Don’t keep me waiting for that final kiss  We can work together through this test  Or we can work through it apart  I just need to get this off my chest  That you will always have my heart...
