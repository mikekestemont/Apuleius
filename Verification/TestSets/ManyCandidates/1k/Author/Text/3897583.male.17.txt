For the first time, I think Exun has been made an official school body. Along with the appointments for 2004-05, yesterday the Exun appointments were also announced. We'll be having dual-Presidency this year with me and Maanick. The third official post is that of 'Head of Programming' and Prateek Rungta is taking it up.  Of course, everyone isn't happy with this decision. It's also not all that good for us. I wanted to be a member of the Editorial Board, but now that Exun is an appointment and one person can have only one post, that will never happen. Also,  urlLink some alumni  don't like the idea of Exun becoming official. It has its advantages and disadvantages, but I hope it's all for the best.  Cheerio --Karan

Hello all!  Welcome to log e exun - the natural log of exun.  --Karan
hi all exun members      just checking weather it works thanks
Right, this is an easy one. All you have to do is write a program.   Here is what it does:  The user is given a list of cards which are arranged in columns. He/She must choose a card and keep it in mind. Through repeated shuffling, the program will ask him/her to identify the column in which the card is. In the end the program tells the user his/her card. The cards in the columns are randomly selected into the column, that is, you can't decide the column in which a perticular card goes.   WARNING-- I have the source code that's available on the net for this, so don't try to give me gum.    ---- Bloodfist out.
SpokesBlah Logs On   Greetings from your officially unoficial SpokesBlah. I would just like to point out that I'm not planning to sit on my ass and do nothing. I shall, indeed, be quizzing, speaking for exun, and I shall also be assiting in Talent Hunts, along with Presidents Sirs.
Let's keep it plain and simple. Most of the members showed up. This log was discussed and the URL was given to all members, and if anyone's smart enough to log on to www.exunclan.com, they'll be able to make their way here.  So, anyway, this site serves the following purposes: - Serve the Exun members with news about upcoming events and competitions (including intra-school events and meetings) - It's a place where we will post Quizzing, Programming questions so that Exun members can hone their skills.  - Submit Reports like this one for the Exun community (and basically anyone else who cares to read) - A place where any Exun member can post an entry and be heard by everyone else. Comments help to communicate between authors and readers.  Apart from that, we announced that each Class (from VIII to XII probably) would be having a Domain Square representative who would be incharge of advertising and promotion for that class. This will help us make Exun kind-of object-oriented and easier to handle, especially in these gaming events in which the participation is large. By object-oriented, I mean to say that each person at his/her level gets his/her duties done and then reports to his/her superior. Just that. The superior shouldn't have to know what the person is doing or how he's doing it.  Maanick Nangia discussed his Project Billboard which should see growth over the next few months.   Exun made a call for new talent for the group, people who are not only skilled at what they do, but more important, sincere, assiduous and interested.  Oh yes, quite an important thing was that member photos got taken and the member list got updated, which shall be reflected on the website soon.  Mukesh Sir stressed the importance of the fact that Exun members need to keep interacting with each other, not only for the sake of it, but also in that it gives meaning to the fraternit&eacute; and everyone learns something or another from someone else.  Every Exun member shall be delegated tasks and given deadlines. These tasks and deadlines will be posted on ln(exun).  That's all folks --Karan President, I say
Dear Exun Member  There will be a meeting of all Exun members on the 29 th  of April, 2004 starting at the beginning of Break that day in Computer Lab IV. I'm sure you'll be able to spare a few minutes for the Clan.  There will be discussion on many topics including Domain Square, the new Model United Nations Conference, etc.  Please be there, and inform any other Exun member you know.  --Karan Misra President of the Exun Clan
