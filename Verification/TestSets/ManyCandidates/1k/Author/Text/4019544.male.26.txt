Today will be the day in history of my life- i'm gonna published the story of Sir Gideon. It's something that i should do a long long time ago. I should thank Dorothy a dear friend of mine for introducing me this site. I find it interesting suddenly to have all your 'life' published online. Great stuff Dot, thanks a million.   Ok, let's start..............   Today, July 24, 2004.....after an unventful Saturday, i suddenly had the urge to write some stuf about myself. I am a very bad publisher as you know..bad with words, bad with ideas and bad with most of the shit around me. But for a forgetful dude like me...at least there's something that will helps me to remember stuff in a day ..hahahaha   Woke up this morning around 0700hrs. Yeah pretty early for a dude, guess the rain and the cold temp sent shiver and goose bumps all over me. As like most of my Sats, i got out of the bed and grab the pole of the broom, and started sweeping the whole house. Josh has long gone off to work.&nbsp;He and his crew will do few commercial shooting in Hard Rock Cafe today..Poor dude, he&nbsp;hasn't has a good full weekend to spend and rest.&nbsp;Rick and Chris, hhmm....still in their candy bar dreams. Still blurry from the event of 'just woke up',&nbsp;I flicked Rick's system switch and the swrilling sound of the motor begins to break the morning silence..."wow!! what a noise".. i thought. Moving the mouse to the url box, i then started to type few of the most important sites in my life...cnn.com, the star.com.my, jpl.gov and who can forget hotmail and yahoo...   I am just interested in the current update of Dr. Judson's chopper crash...Poor doc. I dunno when will the rescue ends. It has been two full weeks now and there's no seems to be any sign of the missing chopper or its passengers to be found. Only God knows where they are now. Pity their family..just imagine, how hellish it could be for them to go through life every day and night without knowing the true fate of their love ones.   Yesterday, the guys and I were whacking pizza at KJ Giants Pizza Hut. It's not a special dinner thingy, just one of those days when we suddenly wanna spent money on good food. The menu of that night, Hawaiian Supreme and Chix Deluxe....two of our all time fav.  Reaching home around 2200hrs, i went online..that was the time when I 'ping' Dot....a nice warm chat&nbsp;we had..  Then she told me that she went through a painful break up. I was&nbsp;shock when she told me this. What kind a dude that silly enough to leave a nice warm lady such as&nbsp;her? This is something that my over stuffed brain can't compute!!!!   She told me most of the story line..then I knew that very instant, this dude called Marcus- he aint ready for commitment...no self confidence. He's the type of dude that "...I am not good for you", "...I need to chase my dreams first and it will hurt you when I can's spend most of my time with you..." blah blah blah.....  Hey!!! wake up chump!!  she's there man!!! all the time for you..   If you know from the begining that you are in love with this nice lady and know that she will be there for you no matter what, what are you&nbsp;'chickened' off!! For me, you can go and chase all your dreams even till Kingdom comes, if you know that she will be there always for you......there's nothing to be afraid of. Dude, this is totally not fair for the lady, man. You are making her feel useless, incapable and crippled. You took half of her life out man!!!  There's nothing else worst than making someone feel this way!!!   Then, I told Dot just to  "forget bout it"... yeah yeah..i know it easy to say than done. But it's the best thing to do. While chatting with her, suddenly my darkest history creeps into my head. The day when Joanne left. It was so so hurting that&nbsp;I didn't even wanna eat for the whole week.I was so so angry, that when the anger struck, i smashed our kitchen door, broke Joel's wooden hanger (sorry dude) and smashed my bed!! - too emotional? wacko? childish? you decide..&nbsp;Anger!! feeling of crushing defeat!!! feeling useless!!! feeling back stabbed!!! all shits were there at that time. It was one HELL of a history.   I told Dot bout this. I know how bad and down she must has felf. I feel sorry for her. It's just not fair. But who are we to say what's fair and not? We learn from this kinda crap. It made me strong, made me immune to all break ups and self pity. So that was yesterday. Hope she can pick herself up slowly and start new chapter in life, like all of us do.   Ahh...it's almost dusk now. Time to go and pump few sets of iron and forget about this sadness and shit. So who wants to live in the life of boredom, sadness and gloom? It's time to get out there and join the Exodus of men out of this nasty and life crushing experience.....  Just wanna focus on the good stuff, or else it's gonna be&nbsp;disasterous through out your day.........   "Turn the page..."&nbsp; Garage Inc.by Metallica   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;
