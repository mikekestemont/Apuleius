well it has finally happened. despite various assertions of "i don't want a relationship" or "i dont want to date her," S has entered into coupleland one step, or maybe three, further. he will forgo hanging with me to be with her. understandably, i'm not putting out, so that is one of the first obvious things. but if it goes deeper, well then like i said, IT has finally happened. ug. nobody breaks plans with me for another girl. and it was suggested that i was welcome along out for the night of drinking and music. but why on earth would i want to do that? no fucking way in hell. i am not going to be a third wheel.  i am so pissed at myself for not sabotaging this a long time ago, when she first asked about him. i thought telling her the full extent of his long-distance girlfriend would stem her interest. but it didnt, as we all know that some people dont care if they are helping someone cheat, or they dont care that the person isnt emotionally available. so she went for it. and now S has dumped the ole gf. not because of this new chick mind you. it was in the shitter for months anyway, but at least it was a distant memory, and easy to forget that his heart was wrapped up in this girl so far away. but now this newest shit is so in my face that i cant breathe.  this bugging me soooo goddamn much has made me realize i need to do a laundry list of things: break it off with N, sabotage S and this dumbass chick, and also tell S how i feel—which actually may just do the trick of him not lasting with her anyway. though i give myself too much credit. i have long been relegated to friend land so there may be no return trip. i see how we are and i know there is more to it than simple friendship, but i think that too much has happened lately for me to say a word and it fare well. what i really must do is bide my time until this runs its course. i cant see him being super into her for the long term. so it may very well run its course as his rebound relationship, i will get thru this shit with N, and then we'll both emerge on the other side. this could all be wishful thinking as well. here i am feeling like my heart is breaking and ironically it has nothing to do with the person i'm dating. i feel like such an asshole.
earlier today i made the mistake of reminiscing online. i googled a girl i was friends with a few years ago. she is a journalist so her articles are online and she's also in a band that has received some press, so it wasnt hard finding shit about her. she is getting married in september, and she is documenting her search for the dress, cake, etc. in a series of articles for the paper she works for. reading more and more i got so sad, because i remembered back to once upon a time, well two years ago, when she said that i would be her bridesmaid. and now that the day is dawning, i'm not. we dont even speak. we never had a huge falling out, or any falling out actually, so that makes it that much worse—to not know what went wrong or why we no longer speak.  i eventually dragged myself out of the house to go see  urlLink donnie darko , which was rereleased in the theaters a few days ago. the extra footage rocked, and made the movie way more understandable. this is now the fifth time ive seen it, and i pretty much understood everything, but this newest version was still unexpectedly great.  i was the first one to walk into the theater, along with S. he insisted he sit on the aisle, since he's 6'5". of course. no biggie. i plop down next to him but then when i think better of it i turn to him and ask, "oh wait, i guess anna is going to want to sit next to you, right?" (anna is a girl he's been seeing, though not seriously, and she likes him more than he likes her)... his response was, "i dont fucking care." he's over it. but being thoughtful, and conceding, i moved in to accommodate the rest of our friends filing in. damn. this annoyed the FUCK out of me.  afterward, i went with anna (she's my friend too; i introduced them actually) over to some friends' house to have some beers and dinner. it was really nice cuz i hadnt seen them in a long while. our conversation at one point turned to moving out of new york. and i'm all for it. i get that feeling from time to time, and i'm back in that groove. i think its helped along by my failing relationship, lack of steady work and that j and j are moving in a few months. i go back and forth in my head all the time about where i would want to move and if i'm ready or if new york has doomed me to be miserable everywhere else. then there is always S. to consider. if i leave the city anytime soon then there is no chance we'd ever end up together because he lives here.  but anyway, now i'm back at home and all the annoyance i have felt all day has caught back up with me. i'm restless. i'm sad. i dont know what i should do. i think i might want to move from new york. i'm in love with one of my best friends, who happens to also be my boyfriend's friend. i wish ill on people at every turn. and i'm stressed to the Nth degree.  i have never had so much frustration about S before. i
