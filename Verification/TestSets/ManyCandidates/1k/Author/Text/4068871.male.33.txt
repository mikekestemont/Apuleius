Good points: (1) kept the speech on time, (2) "felt" great  Bad Points: (1) spoke too fast, (2) did not address his Senate voting record (afterall, it represents 20 years of his life), (3) the mental image of him giving mouth-to-mouth to a hamster
Interestingly enough, the Keepers of the Kerry Blog have posted his book "Our Plan For America" this afternoon, shortly after I visited. I stand corrected. I have already downloaded it and plan to read it tonight. The book is available in Adobe Acrobat format at  urlLink http://www.johnkerry.com/plan/ .
As the election grows near, it’s interesting to see what information is being published by both the Republicans and the Democrats. Case in point, while sitting here I just received three Blog entries, one from  urlLink http://www.georgewbush.com , one from  urlLink http://blog.johnkerry.com , and one from  urlLink http://www.ndnblog.org  (The New Democrat Network).       The entry from Bush’s Blog talks about how the most recent reports out today indicate that the economy is growing and that the recovery has intensified in the last month. They site specific text from various reports and overall, try to make their case in a well thought-out entry. ( urlLink http://www.georgewbush.com/blog/archives/week_2004_08_15.html#001457 )         The entry from Kerry’s Blog talks about how Bush is “squeezing” American families, and how Bush is “doing a job” on them.    It mentions “today’s report” but gives no facts, numbers, or anything from “today’s report” to substantiate their point of view. It mentions that Kerry and Edwards have "a real plan to get the economy going, end the middle class squeeze, and make  America stronger at home and safer abroad" but to date I still have no idea what that plan is. Basically, its just a baseless attack on Bush. ( urlLink http://blog.johnkerry.com/blog/archives/002483.html )  The third entry is even more telling: “Electioneering in    Florida   ?” This brief entry quotes a   New York Times   article about how they feel that the election counting in    Florida    is flawed due to reliance on computerized election systems that have no paper-trail to follow. Actually, the entire entry is a quote from the article with no   NDN   commentary or analysis.    (  http://www.ndnblog.org/archives/000470.html  )             Let’s not kid ourselves. Both party’s are preparing their legal teams in each of the “battleground” states in preparation to contest a close defeat should the grounds be available. What I find interesting is that the Democrats, albeit not Kerry’s official website, are already laying the groundwork to appeal their defeat in    Florida   . This coupled with   The Majority Report’s   constant on-air allegations that the Republicans will use illegal methods to “steal” the election in    Florida   ,    Ohio   , and other states, leads me to believe that they are preparing for defeat in November.         As an undecided voter, I have to admit that I am beginning to lean towards Bush more and more each day. The information that Bush’s people put out shows what Bush is doing and what effect it is having. While at the same time Kerry’s folks are simply talking about his road trip and how wonderful the countryside is, while at the same time talking about how bad Bush is. To this day I still can’t tell you what Kerry would be doing different… Throw in the occasional article about electronic voting and the “stealing” of the 2000 election (it was not the first time that the Supreme Court settled a Presidential election) and I believe that we have just seen the Democrats “blink.”
I am going through my radio archives again playing catch-up after being away for a week, and came across two radio shows that overall paint an interesting picture of today's political climate. The first was Sean Hannity's interview with Vice President Cheney. As an undecided voter, I like to listen to as many of the pundits as I can. Let's face it, Hannity is no more "fair and balanced" than The Majority Report. But he often makes some good points and I like listening to him. His interview with Cheney was very straight-forward and well thought out. Cheney came across as an intelligent leader and expressed his thoughts with clarity. Regardless of what you think of his politics, there is no way Air America is right when they claim him to be literally insane.  Next I turned my attention to my Majority Report archives for the week. No great interviews... In any case, the first thing that raised my eyebrow was an interview with a boy pretending to be the son of one of the Swifties. He talked about how his father drank all day and described the gifts that he was receiving from the Republicans for his father's statements against Bush. I know that the boy was false because they admitted it later in the show. It was a little odd to think that instead of finding information that would contrast the statements that have been made against Kerry's war record, they pull a stunt like this.  The final straw came when Janeane Garofalo, when asked why she did not want to attend the upcoming Republican convention, said that she had better ways to spend her days than hanging around "a bunch of mother fuckers and white crackers." Now, in all fairness, she did elaborate and state that "white crackers" was not strictly a southern reference and that there were "white crackers" in all parts of the country.  PLONK!  Never again will my server capture Air America radio for later listening. Any credibility Janeane had went right out the window with her hateful and racist remarks. And yes, should Sean Hannity ever make such a reference I will cease listening to his network as well.  My only question is "where is the outrage?" Perhaps you should reevaluate your small part in the talk radio arena, Janeane, when even such outrageous remarks fail to illicit a response... could it be because no one cares what you think? I certainly do not anymore.
Blogs have traditionally been a forum for otherwise unknown individuals and groups to post commentary, information, and in general spread ideas and opinions. There was a lot of e
