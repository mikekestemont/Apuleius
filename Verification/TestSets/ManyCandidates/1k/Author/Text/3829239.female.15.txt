i went driving today........it was nice. i went and saw the village yesterday, it was such a waste of alek's 11 dollars. we should've seen a cinderella story! jk.
damn damn damn damn damn damn ! i already had typed out a longo insightful entry, and my dumbass self deleted it all ....somehow.... oh well. ill shorten this all up because im tired of fucking typing. here goes it.
i have a cold and i got it from my brother. being sick sucks ass. justins a dick. i went by his house today to ask to use his phone for two seconds and he didnt even answer the door, he just yelled thru the window asking what i wanted and he said he was busy so i couldnt use it. what a jerk. go choke on a log already.
jeanette and me hosed (is that how you spell that?) eachother down today. it was great, well it was like a thousand degrees out, so it was all good. we started washing my bros jeep and then my parents explorer, just for kix. eew, we cleaned out the birdbath, fungus up the ass, i swear. but anyway, i came to a realization today...i am obsessed with guys. if you are a guy and you are reading this, i want you to know that the humans of your sex are always on my mind. hmmmm, its okay tho, cuz its great. i love guys. whoa whoa whoa, there was a rumble with robert and me last night, we kinda went all off on eachother, well i kinda went off more than he did. but the sad thing is that i had forgot all about robert this summer, other things completely over crowded my mind, i had forgot that i had asked him out, and i had forgot that i had been rejected. now thats bad. i mean, i know i have a bad memory, but Jesus, how do i forget that i was all sad about it. but anyway, i wasnt sad for long, cuz along came elias, and we hung out with adan, and jumped in the river, and hey, well if youre reading this adan, i want you to kno, your friends are so hot. man its great being single.
ummmm 4th of july was so boring, i did absolutely nothing, its like the one day i should do something this summer. celebrate the great day of independence, i dont do anything. i mean i did nothing, i sat on my freakin couch all day and ate. oh but michael tamez called me!!! an old ex boyfriend, i was with him like 2 years ago, and i hadnt talked to him in over a year. it was really nice talking to him again. o yea, so anyway, isnt independence day actually on the 6th, or the 8th or something. whats up with celebrating it on the 4th? thats so whack. well today i went to 6flags, turtles sexy ass called me at 11, woke me up and asked me to go. jeanette was supposed to go with us, but her mom cancelled last minute. "i never said you could go!" damn, that sucked for her. so anyway, my day with turtle was great! this guy tagged along with us.... his name was chris, he was from michigan, he was gay, he liked turtle, he was wearing green, he reminded me of nicholas, he was 17, he was smart? anyway, enought about chris. wow. i had the guts. i grew today. yea right, just kidding. i called justin. yea, umm I called justin. he didnt answer, but he called back. we only talked for like not even 2 minutes, but we didnt really talk, it was more like i talked. ugh i hate when that happens. whats the point of being on the phone if only one person is talking, doesnt that defeat the whole purpose of it being a conversation?!? well i told him i saw stacy the other day....he obviously had already heard from robert, cuz kelley called me later asking if stacey was doing anything with the damn guy cuz justin wanted to know. geeze, does this girl live for gossip? what the fuck!? i hate this. thats it im gonna stop this for today, i want to get back to the life i wish i had.     "im never in my waking life, dreaming is my all the time"
jeanette came back today!!! vito left like at noon, i didnt even notice, cuz i was crashed out hardcore. so then jeanette calls like at 4:30, her and riane, which i hadnt seen all summer walk over here and we hang out for a while. we went to the dollar movies and saw scooby doo 2, and then went to jeanettes house to get some food. we got ramen noodles, and carne guisada in a tub along with some tortillas to make some tacos. so we came back to my house and pigged out. we watched a movie, and before we knew it, it was the 4th of july, so we went outside and popped fireworks. anyway, enough about my day. no, not enough about my day this girl keeps calling....tess. whoever this girl is, is bullshit. ugh!! okay, this is weird, but i want to see elias, why is he in atlanta?!?! lucky mofo. ive been talking to adan a lot, and if i meet someone else, i think itll be weird to stop talking to him. geeze im confused.
wow ummmmm this is weird... well this whole past week since vitos been here we've just kinda been chillin. well i stood in a debut last saturday, melinda, jeanette, and camille went with me, along with my cousin, vito. next day we went to warped tour and that was cool. i saw white chicks like the day before yesterday i think. and today i went to six flags with camille and vito. we saw stacy with some guy, i hope shes cheating on justin, the mofo deserves it! and then well umm we came b
