and by "un-humanitarin" I most certainly meant "inhumanitarian"
Have you ever felt like you've been born into a society in which you have had no say in the regulations? It's true. Unless American people all gathered together every couple of years and had an open floor to anyone with suggestions for social norms, we are living out the dreams and ideas of our ancestors with little say in the foundations of what we are all about.        For instance... Why is it illegal to be nude?  Every other animal on the face of the planet exists in the fashion in which it was born. Except humans. When you break down the situation it sounds quite amazing:   You are born with a body. You are required to wear clothing to cover up your body. Unless you are within the walls of a building which you own(in a place where the public eye cannot see you), or a building that a  willing  friend owns, you cannot be naked. If you appear naked in a place where a public person can view your nakedness you will be detained by other humans (police) and taken into a cage where you will be locked up or let go with a penalty by means of financial payment.    Think about it. You may not want people to see you naked because you have grown up in a society that has taught you not to share your natural appearance with the general public, but wether or not you desire to, you can't. You are required to cover certain parts of your body while in public. Think about that statement: "You Are Required To Cover Certain Parts OF Your Body In Public"    Wasn't that a huge complaint about middle eastern societies? " They are un-humanitarian because they require their women to cover their faces in public " wasn't the United States of America going to free these Afghanistan women from their social bondage of having to be covered. What's the difference between this and America's outlaw of nipples, penis', butt cheeks, and vaginas? Are you going to tell me that America drew the lines of restriction at the exact appropriate place? That would be so ignorant and ethnocentric.     Let's take the time to actually think things through so that we may avoid future hippocracy.
When did the staple of a healthy human diet transcend the border of good and evil? You can't turn on the t.v., walk past a billboard, or turn the pages of a magazine without coming accross an ad for a new "low-carb" food. Since the Atkins diet caught fire the food industry has been more than happy to supply the new needs of a carbohydrate-fearing population.    This cycle began with the Atkins diet becoming popular. The ad wizards of the U.S.A noticed this popularity and began to make products, these advertisements in turn created an even larger following. Now the average joe-america knows that "carbs" are bad. What the fuck?    Do most people understand that "carbs" are actualy carbohydrates, ie sugars, fibers and starches. Has anyone looked at the trusty food pyramid lately. If you have you might notice that carbohydrates are what you should be eating the most of throughout the day. I realize that there have been new studies showing that we may not need as much as we thought, but still, carbohydrates are a main part of a healthy diet. They are our bodies fuel. They help transport protiens (all the new rage) to our muscles.    Another thing that gets me is these "new" products that are hitting the market as "low-carb". Here's some secret information: things that never had any carbs to begin with, like sugarfree jello and diet soda, aren't new products for a carb-free environment. This new coke,C2, what the fuck? It has half the carbs of normal coke so people are going to buy it thinking that they are saving their lives. Hey, guess  what? Diet coke has no carbs, you know why? cause it has no sugar. The sugar in soda is what accounts for all the carbs. So this new C2 is just a mix between regular coke and diet coke. But, all in all this carb craze is meant to scare people. The new products are provided to make these frightened people feel secure.     Seriously, the whole carbs = evil craze is just like the media inventing an imaginary disease and selling medicine that doesn't really do anything.    I have to go now, my french bread is almost done baking.
You know what? Blogs don't have to be all-criticizing of social experiences. I've sure as hell read a lot that are. But I feel the need to give some electronic shout-outs.    What about the guy who made it possible to record things on the digital tip? Thank you very much Dr. twentyfirst century. Now I, as well as anyone else with acess to a  computer can record their own music with a somewhat decent sound. I'm not implying that their music will be decent, but at least the technology for hiss-free recording is available.    by the way- check out Datathoughts.com, the DRugs are the new up-and-coming band. They'll get in your face.
The ideas pertaining to "freedom" and "indaviduality" have been skewed in this country to an indescribable state. Why do we associate optimal-amount-of-choices with personal freedom.    I was in Albertsons the other day. I was walking past the small Starbucks stand they have so conveniently set up inside the store and I had the most unfortunate opportunity to overhear a woman ordering her "coffee". She ordered her drink as if she was reciting some portion of the declaration of independence, memorized for a fourth grade presentation. "I'll have a double-soy-chai-latte-with extra foam-at 140 degrees." 140 DEGREES!!! How on God's green earth does this woman have any idea at what temperature she preffers her coffee. Maybe she should have been more specific though, you know...she didn't really specify whether that was 140 F or celcius. The Starbucks employee might misunderstand and fix her a grande cup of molten lead.     I g
