Why is dating necessary?  I mean, really.  Why?  Lately my girl and I have been asking ourselves this question and neither one of us can figure it out (she's a pessimist).  I am usually a positive person when it comes to things like this but I think she may be on to something here.  I mean, just imagine living your life to the fullest w/ all of your good friends around you.  Everyone is single, so there is no relationship drama.  If you need to fuck or "make-love", you would just find a suitable mate, do your thing, and then meet up w/ your boyz afterwards for some drinks.  Wouldn't it be nice...  I know why most people date, because they want to settle down w/ that special someone and have kids, then comes the house w/ the white picket fence.  I am not bashing that life at all, it's all good.  But couldn't you find all that without going through the excruciating process of dating.  Just close your eyes for a minute (no, i'm serious...close them) and imagine a world without arguing, fighting, biting, kicking, scratching, throwing the cat against the wall, crying, begging, beating on the door, giving up friends, and abandoning your true self...jesus, it gives me a boner just thinking about it.    And if that were the case, why would we need marriage?  We could all just be cool and get along instead of: falling in love, having kids, fighting about shit, figuring out we don't feel the same anymore, getting a divorce, fighting over the kids, and then splitting half of what we have worked all our lives for (which is usually not equal, by the way).    If I could have my good friends around me for the rest of my life knowing that none of us were going to get married, I wouldn't need a wife b/c I would have them.  And if all females did the same it would be fucking paradise!  For all those who want to raise kids, hey, just find a girl who is really cool and willing to raise a kid with you.  Then once the kid is grown and on his/her own, you can go back to absolute, uninhibited fucking hedonism.  I think the whole game of love needs to be reformed and reconstructed.  What do you guys think?
Alright, here's the rest of my weekend continued...sort of.    So who the fuck is the lady of the Chi?  My girlfriend, who is one of the coolest chicks I've ever met.  I mean, she's fine (at least I think so), and she as an amazing body, but that's not really why I'm into her.  She's down-to-earth, not high-maintenance, intelligent, and the sex is incredible.  In fact, I've never had so much sex w/ a single person in my entire life...I don't get bored having sex w/ her (that's never really happened before).    So this weekend I'm on the way to her place from the Phish concert, hung over like you wouldn't believe, and everything is going smoothly....and then it happens.  Traffic.  Son-of-a-bitch!!!  This weekend was "The Taste of Chicago", and it was like the whole god-damn world was descending upon downtown.  I mean, WTF is goin' on here?  I lived in Houston for almost 4 years, and traffic in Houston is horrible....but the worst traffic I ever dealt w/ in H-town had nothing on the traffic coming into Chicago this weekend.  To make it even worse...I was tired as hell and hung over!  Of course when I got there it was all worth it, and we wasted no time at all in getting down to business.  I didn't even take her skirt off....too much work.  Of course she didn't complain, she's always down for the cause.  We're talking about some hot-ass sex here, people.  I mean, the chemistry is just there....some people have to try over-and-over to find that.  Hell, some people never do.  And what's even better....after the sexual olympics is over, we can still hang out and have a good time.  Yep, it's true, I think we gotta keeper here.  At this point I could make this a very dirty post and give all the explicit details of our sexual adventures, but then again, that's what the imagination is for.  Besides, it's really nothing that spectacular, I mean, we don't dress up or use toys or anything like that.  The sex is too damn good, there's no time for that stuff and it's too damn distracting as far as I'm concerned.  Besides, I love this girl and there are just some things that are better left alone.   What more can I possibly say, besides, this time I've struck gold (at least so far it looks that way).  This girl is smart, she works for her own shit, she's good looking and her body is bangin', and of course there's the sex....which is great.  I think I'd be a complete idiot if I did anything to fuck this up...hence the words in my profile, "Ex-hedonist".  Sometimes you have to sacrifice the pleasure of many, for the love of one....I think it's worth it.  What do you think?
Ok, I just posted a fucking novel about marriage that was kinda mellow, ok it was like getting shot in the ass w/ a tranquilizer dart (which probably isn't the best feeling by the way).  So now I'm gonna post a few things that aren't so boring.    I just witnessed an amazing thing.  I was at the Phish concert @ Alpine Valley Friday night.  The concert was awesome of course, I don't even listen to Phish but going to one of their concerts is an experience that everyone should have.  Unfortuntately it's one of their last ones ever so that made it even better.    By the end of the concert, let's just say I was seeing visuals that Monet couldn't have painted if he wanted to.  Here's the recipe for success if you want an idea of my experience:  1) 3 pot brownies 2) about 12-15 beers (over a 10 hour period) 3) 3
