I'm making myself crazy; it's getting to the point where I can't tell what's good and what isn't. I think it's good when I'm writing it; I think, at last, I've found the vase for my petunias (or the bedpan for my piss). Then, while I'm watching Law & Order with Jon (a double feature tonight), the new and supposedly improved pages on my desk begin to taunt me:  Not so fast , they say.  You know we're not quite right, not even close . I know I should leave them alone until morning; I know I should take my blood pressure pill (yes, I'm old) and go to bed. If I don't sleep tonight, I won't be able to write in the morning; I'll wake up at two in the afternoon (I know, poor me) and feel the day is shot. At three there's Dr. Phil (reruns, no less), and at four, People's Court; or I could go for the five o'clock Dr. Phil and Charmed at six (more reruns). I'd unplug the TV, seriously I would, but without it, I'd need medication.   So, against my better judgment, I sat for a moment at my desk before going to bed, David Letterman kissing Sharon Stone in the background, and I read the three (almost three) measly pages I managed to crank out this afternoon, after I spent the entire morning researching a Royal Caribbean cruise I can't afford; I now know the layout of all fifteen decks of the ship,  Voyager of the Sea . I am also familiar with the full trip itinerary (7 Nights, Western Caribbean, departing from Miami, with stops in Belize City, Costa Maya, Cozumel, and George Town/Grand Cayman), as well as all the extra excursions available at each stop (this took some time). In addition, I can tell you the dress code requirements for both men and women for the formal dining room; the amenities of the various staterooms (a hair dryer is included in each room, you'll be happy to know); and Royal Caribbean's refund policy, in the event of a hurricane, for instance. Mind you, I kept returning to the Royal Caribbean website on Jon's computer (his is connected to the internet, mine is not) while, next to my computer, my coffee grew cold and the dreaded pages waited in vain, at least until after the Price is Right (a guy won three cars).   Well, well. Some writer I am. It's just that, after thinking I was on a roll (don't make me seasick) with thirty good pages, it's hard to start over; imagine if it was fifty, or a hundred and fifty. How would I deal with that? All I can think of is Chevy Chase in one of my all-time favorite movies (naturally),  Funny Farm  -- the one where he unwittingly eats all those bull testicles and his wife ends up being the writer instead of him, inspired by a stuffed squirrel. I feel the need to rent that movie.   Jon says I'm trying too hard; I know he's right.  Just keep going , he says.  Don't look at the old pages . It's the same advice I would give to someone with my symptoms. And be patient (like Dave said in the Comments); a novel's not something I can figure out with a snap of the fingers. Sure Faulkner wrote  As I Lay Dying  in six weeks while working at a power plant, but I'm no Faulkner. I'm a whiny little brat who enjoys bull testicles (well, who doesn't?).   I need to stop now; my, this blog is a good outlet, though. Thanks to all who've offered advice and encouragement; much appreciated. Tomorrow's another day; initially, I wanted to finish a draft of my novel this summer (ha!), but, at this point, I'd be happy to finish in a year of consistent work. That's a more realistic goal. I suppose, at some point, I should say what the novel's about. Alas, tomorrow; I'm tired and my face is flushed from the Metropolol. Maybe I'll call my mom (my adopted mom, Edith); she turns 89 on Monday. Luckily, she's more of a night-owl than I am. When I was in high school, I used to fall asleep to her late-night renditions at the piano of  Those Were the Days, My Friend , and  Five Foot Two, Eyes of Blue, Has Anybody Seen... ; I don't know what I'll do when she isn't there for me to call anymore (may it not be for a long time, knock on my wooden skull -- knocking on wood, my one remaining superstition). When I was a kid, and I still said prayers, I tried to name everyone I knew in my prayers each night. The list of names grew longer and longer. My mom would sit on the edge of the bed and wait until I was finished. I closed my eyes, folded my hands on top of the covers, and recited the names. I worried that if I forgot anyone, something bad could happen to them. There's a character in my novel, Nina, who does the same thing.   By the way, Room Service on  Voyager of the Sea  is available twenty-four hours.
Thought I'd share a poem today. The novel is one project I have this summer (ad infinitum); the other is my poetry manuscript. It's difficult to figure out an order for the poems. The next book of poems I have in mind is more unified in its theme: a collection of prose poems in the voices of various patients in a mental health institution. My current collection, however, is more eclectic; many of the poems, however, deal with my birth mother, Adrienne. This is one of my favorites:
So we're coming to the end of July, and I've hit a wall. During the cycle of the school year, I teach high school English in the Bronx, and I was looking forward to the summer and the opportunity, finally, to write.  I had planned to live as a monk and concentrate on my w
