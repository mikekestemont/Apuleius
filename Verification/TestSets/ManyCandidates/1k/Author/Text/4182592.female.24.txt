I'm gonna discuss about the future of recruiting. I'll take some time to do it.  Future of Recruiting [part 1-6], Electronic Recruiting Exchange  urlLink http://www.erexchange.com/articles/db/   AC90AB2C425E41B3A847602F99C4FDD3.asp
Declaration is something too big, isn't it? Especially when I'm going to talk about that of my life. I love simplicity. Therefore, what I want to communicate now is so simple - what I passonately believe which will lead me to a meaningful existence as a human being in this beautiful world.  1)   If you don't believe in yourself, who will?   I have been so sad for years - precisely, the whole of my teen and undergraduate time - why I'm not born with a good brain and good communication skills as my close friends who are always being complimented and admired as damn smart, nice and lovely people. In my eyes, they are so tatented, energetic, quick-mind, cheerful, outgoing, wise and so on. They are able to undertand and solve problems in a minute while I even didn't have enough time to recognize what the issues are. They are able to tell interesting stories, attract others with their charisma and even manage people to do what they want! For me, whenever I achieve something, people always say that...oh Phi, you are so lucky! I hate being complemented like that. I want to be like my friends. I'm sure you know the disapointment, sadness and even distrust in my own ability I have suffered. One nice morning, I got up, had breakfast and went to school by bus as usual. On the bus, I was struck by the thoughts that...oh...I know by now, I'm like a turtle in the race with the rabbit in the traditional tale that people know. The mysterial problem is answered now. I'm not born with favourable skills and talent but I have the determination and passion for achivement. I'm a normal person with good mental abiilty and nice appearance. I feel thankful for being a person with all the necessary resources. What I have to do, in the race against the smart and quick rabbit, is to run - determinedly, relentlessly and passionately towards the destionation. I just can't demand people to see me like a smart, outgoing and charismatic rabbit. No, I'm not. I'm a lovely, but full of passion, turtle. I believe in my victory 5010% percent. When I believe, then nothing can stand in my way.  2)   Self-actualization desire  . Someone probably may ask me: "Why do you want to pursue an entrepreneurial life? It is full of ups and downs. I don't think it is a wise idea, Phi". Probably, he/she is right. I may not be successful like Bill Gates, Starbucks Coffee's owner or the like. But the overall objectives for my hard-working life is not for money or fame but: - to fulfill my self-actualization, i.e. compete with my potential capabilities, don't necessarily compare with others' success. If anyone is successful, I'm (or trying to) happy for them. - to challenge myself, create a meaning of my life - to create wealth for the society, good jobs and opportunitites for development for my employees - to become a beautiful person in the next life, which is perceived as the rewards for beautiful things I have contributed to life, people and society so far.  With these credos in mind, I believe I would atract alike minds to work with me in my future company. It would be great!  I don't find a single similarity between myself and Bill Gates. But I have a desire to have some good thing like him. Therefore, I would try to see the world under his oyster, and lead the life which reflects the good things he do such as being sharing love and wealth to poor people, creating wealth for the society, leading a happy and simple life, earning money not for selfish use but for the contribution - to give.

MANAGEMENT DEFINITIONS OF THE FUTURE
My priorities would be:  First, sharing leadership. I agree with Goldsmith and Marshall that this is a requirement, not an option. I view this quality as an internal resource of a future leader.  Second, demonstrating technological savvy. As technologies are playing very important roles in our life like Internet, CRM systems of supermarkts, e-government and so on, an ability to use those tools as a competitive advantage is also crucial to a leader.  Thirdly, think globally. The world is getting smaller for people now can build up relationship, do business without leaving home or their own countries. The world will be the common market for its global citizens.  Fourth, building partnerships and alliances. It is important to make strategic alliances or partnerships because small companies will not be able to survive in future economical environment. This action is probably a must.  Finally, appreciating cultural diversity. Obviously, talent people are the most valuable asset of the company. Future leaders need to take advantage of this labor force without any biases.
