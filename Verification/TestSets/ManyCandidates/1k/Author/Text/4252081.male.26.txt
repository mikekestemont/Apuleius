‘Origins of species by means of natural selection; or, the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life’, maybe a bit of a mouthful, but it is an important book for all those thinkers out there. At the age of 22, Charles Darwin went on a world tour with a few of his naturalist buddies (not to be confused with the now popular naturist buddies) to far off lands with coral reefs and dragons, where he met strange natives with bones in their noses and poison tipped arrows. They wandered around uncharted seas in a little boat for 5 years, picking up plant samples, finding insects with thousands of little legs and analyzing multicoloured birds before the hungry cabin boys could put them in the pot. Despite suffering badly from sea sickness and giving up the life of luxury that a rich Victorian is used to, Darwin soldiered on with his project, and returned to England quite the world savvy explorer. He spent the rest of his life recovering from some mysterious Amazonic STD, studying the bottles of pickled lizards and dried butterflies that he had collected on his travels. Darwin also had a few theories on life; how it was created, how it was evolving and perhaps how it might end. He shared his thoughts with friends over a pot roast pheasant one night, which thought he might have a strong case.  ‘You should write a book Charlie, you’re bloody clever so you are’.  So he wrote a book, that even he thought was good, so he wrote another, and another. The titles became longer and stranger, and the discussion deeper and darker with the summing up of a life’s work being published in his penultimate year entitled ‘The formation of vegetable mould, through the actions of worms, with observations on their habits’. I’m yet to get to that one, but it will certainly be next, just after I finish reading the National Enquirer that is next to my bed.  It is important to keep up with world affairs, and following the British dramas of the Hutton enquiry and the American Martha Stewart scandal, as well as keeping up with Jordan’s latest flame and the conspiracy theories of Janet Jackson’s right nipple clamp is nearly a full job time in itself. Reading the Enquirer at night helps with the American gossip, but isn’t much use when I want to know about John-two-jags-Prescott’s latest punch up or Wayne Rooney’s new love nest. So, when some friends came over from old blighty, they were instructed to bring over ‘Britain’s biggest selling newspaper’, the SUN. As the American audience may not know the Sun is famous for it’s outrageous headlines (such as KUNTZ! After master striker Stefan Kuntz scored the goal that put England out of the Euro ’96 championship) but also for the upstanding young ladies who get their baps out for the nation every morning on page 3.  ‘Well fit’, was Jonny’s comment on Zoe, 22, from London. And with 32-24-34 C measurements I could appreciate what he was talking about.  We were all at a bar in the right part of town later that day, at a poetry slam, and a hilarious middle aged woman got on to the stage and tickled us pink with a long winded story about a little blue box from Tiffany’s, ‘I don’t know what it is about her, she isn’t that fit, but there is something about her..’ Jonny, she is over 50, she has let herself go a bit too far, I’m not with you on this one. Jonny, Anna and Lou stayed for a week, and every nightspot we went to Jonny would find beauty, where sadly sometimes it was hard to find. Maybe those Chicagoan beer goggles are that bit stronger than the ones back home. ‘That girl looks like Joley Richardson, she is absolutely gorgeous, the fittest I have seen here so far’. Time for bed Jonny. When the English crew returned to their daily grind back home and I was left in Chicago with nothing more than a sack of carrots to keep me company, I started to think back to the funny northern boy and his funny northern lingo. What exactly is fitness all about? It used to be about how far you could run, or how many lengths you could swim, but now in England it is all about beauty. So I wonder what exactly Charles Darwin was thinking about when he wrote about his theory of the ’survival of the fittest’. Is it about beauty conquering all? When the pet cat has kittens, the runts of the litter are always the first to go. The kids always want to keep the prettiest kittens for themselves. And in an age where appearance has never been so important, over-worked plastic surgeons may agree that Darwin was right all along, straight teeth, and a good rack will be an important part of getting that promotion, and finding that dream man (insurance of survival). Beautiful people are often more confidant, more likely to succeed in life, as the cream always rises to the top.   But then there are those who believe that to survive, you must battle your way to the top of the pile, be it in one big punch, or a slow wearing down of the competition, body beautiful or ugly as sin. It is all about what is inside, and how much you have inside. Survival of the fittest is certainly relevant in the army where they push you to your limits physically, to train you to fight those merciless strangers in a far off land that have pissed of your President. Preparation is three quarters of the battle. If you are trained well, if you are fit, you are more likely to survive. But as strict as they train them in the army, you all should know that we have the famous General in charge of discipline in our kitchen, and making it through the day is as much of a challenge as it i
