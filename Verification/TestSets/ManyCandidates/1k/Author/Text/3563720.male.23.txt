Seasons do change. This doesn't happen in California. It's quite strange. Life remains vivid in the death of summer. Some toss around baseballs and footballs while others lounge on the grass. A lovely scene.  Couples cutely walk through the autumnal bliss. Even Ezra and Andrew seem happy today. Their statuesque figures are warm and free from nature's torment, minus periodic spiteful birds. Life's curveballs lose their movement for brief moments.  Anxiety aggraves unpleasant pathologies within my digestive system. I feel evil forces again. They're latent instead of overt. The conspirators can't come here to get me because they're already here.  I try to move my mind back to the place of youthful innocence. Angry joggers take me away from it periodically on my walks. The pleasantness of this situation is a very tenuous equilibrium.
What would you do if I followed you? crush me with your car smash my skull with crowbar make me drink Simple Green put a bullet in my spleen stick a ferret in my rectum or simply befriend me out of boredom?
You appear through the mundane - a world of lines, libraries, and airplanes You leave me with no choice but to stare at your seductive green eyes and dark curly hair. You adorn yourself with mall-purchased clothing; olive pants and a white tank-top, from Abercrombie. I need to meet you and converse on a walk but have not the courage to you to talk You must adore film and The Doors and want to live in a California home with a jacuzzi and hardwood floors...  However anxiety convinces me to let you remain a mystery
Complete hell becomes almost tolerable
Intolerable Terrain Holding All  Climatic Atrocities  or  Inexplicably Tolerable Haven  Advancing Curious  Adventures?  "ITHACA" becomes "THC" in the linguistic environment _[-vowels].
Freedom's shore approaches in the middle of the night. It is springtime and the sun signifies the youthful vibrancy of coupling and spiritual fulfillment. I presently feel oblivious to these elements. The experience of waiting continually intensifies. Anticipatory, nervous chills race through my spine.  Rest is impossible on this solo journey. Thoughts of how love has failed me twice before render this state. Loneliness disturbs me for the first time in months. My mind races through thousands of slightly differentiated paths that are all mental aliases for my companionship needs.  Waiting for the sun to come along. Waiting. Waiting.  Daylight and chances to be happy taunt me through their absence. All will be well once this night is over.  The destroys the night as the sun slowly rises. My seratonin levels increase and provide a settling chemical rush.  I ask the sun what went wrong. Why did it not come sooner? It does not reply. It simply emanates more heat. The light energy then burns a message into the sand: learn to forget.  Learn to forget?  A crystal ship appears on the shore, apparently to take me away. The captain screams "1000 thrills! 1000 girls!" I jump aboard to be greeted by Jenna Jameson and a bottle of Cristal. Forgetting suddenly becomes much easier...
Everyone is starting to look alike; not quite identical; similar akin to different brands of bike  My peers are such repetitive sights with the same clothes and the same hairstyles and the same tastes...  They all share the same plight: too much time and money  coupled with no need to fight  These people do not think about survival -  let alone ethics, morality, mankind or even whether everything seems uniform  Alas, I am guilty as well I sport a generic haircut Overpriced designer jeans and grew up in a comfortable home in an upscale suburban hellhole  And I wonder why our elders see us as herds
Her eyes stare blankly at words on a page as she blindly moves her highlighter with rage  Tawdry gold-hoop earrings complement  her dirty brown hair and clear complexion  The males around her have no choice but to stare, not at the book, but at her lavender-accentuated look
The medical man on a meter analyzes the mental bleeder  The patient discusses how she adores pornography, but not nearly as much as she loves amphetamines  The doctor glances at his Rolex watch as his monitor displays the client's crotch  She finds it odd that he stares at the screen on his desk but, compared to other shrinks, feels no need to protest  When the session is over she receives a hefty bill for services rendered and he uploads some footage that might not even offend her  Alas, she ignores the bill because it came with a prescription -  the one that will temporarily fulfill her Dexedrine addiction
I found my work from my first creative writing course during my sophomore year of college. Its content accurately represents some of what was inside my head during that period of my life. In retrospect, I have mixed feelings about the quality of these pieces. They have many nuances that I now perceive as flaws. Yet, they were really fun for me to write, as well as therapeutic, back then. I hope that the readers of these short compositions gain something from their bizarre content.
Even though the game clock is not expired, it's safe to say that the Detroit Pistons are going to win the NBA Finals. Two minutes left, 98-79 in favor of Detroit.   Four future hall-of-famers failed to meet expectations (especially Gary Payton).   The Pistons simply played as a better team unit.   May the Lakers revamp as a franchise and EARN an NBA Championship within the next few years. Management must find quality talent that is willing to play hard consistently. The end of their dynasty has come (some argue that it ended last year against the Spurs in the Western Conference Semifinals).   At least my Dodgers (a regular source of disappointment), are up 4-0 and still in first place in the NL West (albeit by percentage points).
This year's NBA Finals is painful to watch at this point. Unless the Lakers become the first team in league history to come back from a 3-1 deficit, a team from one of the most miserable, decayed cities i
