It took a long time to publish my blog.It,rather is a long time between the first and one that is published now.This period of hibernation was not because that,I was busy during this time.But,it was due to the fact that I nearly forgot about my  blog account.  How did  I really remember about this one? Why should I remember about this one? The difference between the status of my first and only blog and the present one is,that,I was jobless and had a lot of time to browse about blogger.com.  Now,I have the same free time ,but with a job of more responsibilities and less work.I can blog for hours without being disturbed.  I am still waiting for a high point in my life to occur,because,I can't see myself sitting in front of the computer doing nothing.I am thinking for a job change ,but in a software company as a programmer.Even that requires sitting in front of the computer for longer hours than now.But,I will be paid better and atleast won 't get bored.  I will get my head tonsured ,if,I could get a pay 4 times my present pay.
Whenever ,I start writing these blogs under each heading,my mind turns in to a different mode.My other blog "my mistakes?!! " contains explicit crib.I start to crib about crib about everything and finally add that everything was my mistake.  Everytime,I open the "views" ,my mood changes to a different mode.I start writing about women.I start to scream in my mind " I am becoming a sex maniac".Wherever ,I go,people watch porn.So,I start watching too.Then ,every naked woman looks awful and boring.  In every post of my "views" ,I criticise a woman.I think ,I  am becoming more of a male fanatic than a lover.  My mind has become a paradox.I will just explain it to you ,what it is. When I look at a woman from a distance ,I imagine that this woman ,I am looking at to be a gorgeous and a perfect woman in every respect.But,when I get to  one,my mind starts to dislike that lady.I never mentioned this to anybody because,anybody who hears this could say that,I am crazy.There is only perosn who knows about this ,my colleague Ajay.I told him about this and he said" your mind denies what you want."  I know that,I create my own fantasies and when these are not fulfilled,I start to dislike what I have.  Ajay is a strong guy,in the sense that,he can acknowledge reality.He knows the things he can't do and what he can.He dissects everything and presents real facts which sometimes are diturbing.These facts ,just deny you of dreaming.Realism,when presented the hard way restricts you from proceeding further into achieving your dreams.When hard realistic without any solutions are presented by most unsuccessful people becomes hard to digest.  I started to begin the quest of studying people and their reaction to situations as a way to go through people to achieve my own benefits.Now,when ,I am at the middle of my study,I have to study my own reactions.It just makes me feel that Iam a different person altogether.  Studying my psyche,I began as a boy,a fat boy,fat gay,then a slim gay and then again to a boy I really imagined was.This cycle left me to wonder whether ,really ,I am a male or just pretending to be a guy just for the sake of the society ,I was a part.I just prepared a theory ,that every male begins and transforms into accorrding to their own success and failures.A loser starts to think negatively about himself and has delusions about what he really is not.while a successful guy thinks everything positive about him,and even feels that everybody should feel positive about him.In the back of his mind he knows his weakness.  I am positive about mycareer,but,my career doesn't seem to move forward.There are two people who have a stagnant life.The lift operator and the security guard who have a stagnant career.They just eat ,drink and sleep.I don't want to be anything like them.I just want to be a mover and shaker .I want to make a difference in everybody 's life.
Girls will be girls .And girls are stupid.Thats what you should believe.Its not that you should fanatically follow this rule about the stupidity of women.But,follow it as rule to just understand them better.Never try to be too harsh with them,please.If a tiger ,whale or anyother animal needs compassion ,so should a female get a little bit of kindness from the males.  When , you say that "All women are stupid,and those who are not stupid are not women", you will find a woman say that ,"there is a girl here".How stupid can a girl get?  At an young age all girls are nearly are the same as boys.When they reach the start of their puberty ,they start becoming stupid.Stupidity in women cannot be defined.If you are not a female you will just know that they are stupid.It is just that ,the cuteness of their stupidity which attracts me.  You got to give them the credit for their stupidity.They create a wide variety of stupid situations ,you think you had passed through this situations before.Wait! you are in for a trap,this time they give you an altogether a different situation with a variation of the earlier one.  They are like computer viruses,they get installed into your computer without your permission and stall your activity by holding onto your data.They get to your address book and mail themselves to all your contacts. Women are like computer worms ,they come into your life undetected and keep replicating themselves until you cry out for space. When you try to remove your virus(women)they take something of value along with them.   Sometimes,I feel that a stupidity of a woman gets more obvious when she gets married .That's when her husband gets to know about her more.There are more than her knowing her innate stupidity.  Its not that she is born stupid.It is that she grows without knowing her capabilities  or the boundaries for being stupid.When a girl is b
