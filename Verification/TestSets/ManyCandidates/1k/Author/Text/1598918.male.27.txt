WHY KAZAA IS BAD NEWS FOR THOMASU   Here are a few reasons not to download/use file sharing software (such as  KAZAA ) on campus.  Not only is it illegal to share intellectual property such as a popular song or movie clip, but  urlLink the RIAA has begun to prosecute KAZAA users .  There is also a bill in congress  urlLink (`Piracy Deterrence and Education Act of 2003')  that, if passed, will bring the federal government into the hunt for copyright infringement.  So, downloading music that you have not paid for is illegal.  And software that allows such trading should not be on campus computers.

BUENA VISTA UNIVERSITY IS DOING TECHNOLOGY RIGHT   While at a conference in Atlanta last week, Buck and I met Ed Barboni, a gentleman who works with small Universities and Colleges throughout the nation.  Buck asked, "What schools have you visited that are getting it right?  Who is seemlessly integrating technology onto their campus?"  Ed quickly spat out, "Buena Vista University.  Though they have a lot of money, they are doing everything absolutely right."    Check out the  urlLink Buena Vista University Site .  Buck and I were especially impressed with their  urlLink Tech Department .

urlLink THE STATUS OF UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING   This article requires  urlLink Adobe Acrobat Reader  which can be downloaded  urlLink here  if for some strange reason you are without.   Excerpt - "Today there are over one hundred laptop campuses. Most are in Canada and the United States. Within larger universities are another fifty-plus subgroups, especially colleges of business and engineering, that require commonly configured laptops of students and faculty in the programs. Beyond these universal laptop programs, we estimate that at least half of all colleges and universities in the United States are 'practicing ubiquity' -- that is, teaching proceeds on the assumption that every student and faculty member has appropriate access to the Internet. Ironically, the tight definition of ubiquitous computing no longer prevails because the concept itself has become ubiquitous."  The articles discusses the implications of a true tech savvy campus while relating the trials and tribulations of a few trailblazing college's and universities.

This information (such as what websites you visit and how long you are there) is sold to another company or used to tailor advertisements to pop up on your computer.  Not only is Spyware unwanted, but the programs eat up computer resources and have been known to cause full system crashes.  The programs are written to run behind the scenes and to self propogate themselves.  They often come packaged with popular free programs like KaZaA and Comet Curser as their inclusion in the download package is buried in the "End User Liscence Agreement."  What can we d
