Don't make me cry because i have no tears. Reluctant to be engulf be sadness but nothing can be done. Yearning for true love yet came a false alarm. Ending maybe hard and difficult but bugging will never works. Recollecting memories holds its meaning but grieving over past is cruelty.
Naive is hoping for impossibilities. Selfishness request for more. Stupidity makes yourselves look silly. Stubbornness refuses to accept the reality. Complacency limits yourself from improvement. Foolishness brings shame. Realistic bored your partner. Manliness shows no interested. Feminine shower with care n concern. maturity gains the fame. Childish bears the consequences. Love is special but isn't magnificent and lead you nowhere. Is there something call Everlasting? Neverending? Forever or even Eternity? I doubt. Prove everything to me. Everything will end after you met enough people.
Forgiveness is the biggest virtue. Only forgiveness can bring down hostility to harmony.Love life pondering through my head. chemistry isn't enough to proceed to the future. Promises keep the person but not his heart. Running away from commitment is selfish. Compromising your partner is basic. Honesty will accumulate trust. Giving everything you can will lead to being taken for granted. Precious words had now became worthless. Love isn't selfish, it will reciprocate.
Experience can prevent you from making mistakes but still cannot escape from heartbroken state. Abide by the choice made by stubbornness. Abandan everything with courage. Stand guard against everypassby chances. Regardless good or bad and assume everything is here to destroy n hurt you. Driven to madness by love. When will i grow up? How long must i remain as a kid? the rising sun is forcing me to move on. Where did i come from? Where should i proceed to? Where is safe for me? Insecurity is how i feel. Everybody had put on a poker face. What is real; what is fake? I don't know. I can only stay calm and analyse every single person. Not to let my guards down. Judges are unbelievable. DO humans know that people around are putting on a facad? Or have they realise and refuse to believe that they are? Or are they simple n pure? Are their sympathy real or are they there to mislead you n get you hurt again? Complex - a set of prepressed emotions and ideas which affext a person's behaviour; an exaggerated reaction(to something). I had enough of thepeople who hides their true evil self. Show yourself! Stop it! I had seen lots of fabrications. Convinced that that humans learn to protect themselves. Kind hearted is not my personality. Hatred in me cause me to lose myself again. Learned that standing in the crowd will only endangered myself but i chose to hide inside. The philosophies of human nature is profound. Ridiculous contradictions only put yourself into more confuse mindset.
The dream happiness which everyone pursue after. The best moment is just before we got it. Just because we get hold of it. We have to start afraid of losing it. Be it jealousy or possessive, the root of the cause is always fear. To give too much, the other party will take for granted. To give too little, he will think u don't love him enough. To ask for too much, he will blame u for not respecting him or ask for too much. To ask too little, he will think that u don't concern about him. Too much questioning, he will think that u don't trust him. If the status really causes all this problems, why not we always remain dating? Why not just enjoy each other companion? Whylet those fear manipulate us? Even though we know thats the cause, but we are selfish n choose to proceed with confident. We just see the surface of the problem and avoid it by tolerate n keep pains to ourselves. Do the other party know that we are suffering? Humans do have feeling. When the feelings is beyond our control, when we couldn't hide it anymore. Our tears will start to drop. Some will ask why is this happening to them? some will abuse themselves. Some will drink or smoke. Some will blame others but not themselves. But least will introspect themselves. Theother party may be a flirt or he just couldn't tolerate ur atrocities. We must know how to learn n stop being crazy. The definition of love is too profound. There is no one that can explain every single detail. There is always mystery hiding deep inside. So we cannot assume that we are able to control our love. We are not able to change the fact that we cannot control the other party. We cannot change their mindset, unless they are willing to. If not he will be suffering again. There will always be something to lose. Something really precious
The song once burns the flame of love between us had now extinguished. In order to commemorate our past memories, i will listen to our song once again. Used to escape from this song n deny that u were once my past. But all of the sudden, its doesn't bothers me anymore. So i assume that i don't love u. To look at u once again, i felt that u r unfamiliar. Taking another closer look, i can't recognise u anymore. Are u ther one i deeply love before? I think the defensive wall within my heart had recover from the past hurting wounds. Probably time really heals all wounds. Just finish writing. I fallen asleep
The flowers had long blossomed. Am i still living in the past. Do u still remember how we met? Or have u forgotten our promise? The blazing sun came along with us. The journey seems to left me with much of painful & unforgettable memories rather than happiness. Planning the future but dare not think of being with eternally. Eternity is an impossibility. Like the daily routine of the sun, our love had set down. Perhaps there is no more love in us. Why am i still living in torments? I'm sure that i don't love u a
