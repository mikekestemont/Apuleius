here i am again at my work. lately it feels like there is no pressure on me.  work is flowing fine, im actually caught up with my own crap and learning to post ERA files - it was fun but when i start dealing with credit balances and penalties - that's when it gets hard and confusing. anyways, life in general is doing alright. altho' a part me sometimes misses my husband.  i know deep down in my heart at the very bottom.. ahahah - i still love the dude.. but the life he wants to live is not the way i want to live.  inseparable differences - so they say! he gets the kids sometimes and that anger and hatred that i feel when i see him is not there anymore. I don't feel that i want him either. Don't get me wrong, i guess i am really moving on. altho' some people still bug me to go back to him for the sake of the kids.  What good will that do if we are not gonna get along? if he's still going to out all the time, if he still won't be able to support his own family, if his ass is still attach to his mom? maybe when he change, maybe when he realize things, MAYBE just maybe i will re- consider.  KIds.. are growing up. next month i'm going to enroll them to dolores st school.  so they start learning and have a social life so they dont fight all the time.  i just need to get that yellow immunization card from the doctor.  that's a painful $25.00 for each. OUCH! Camp is coming and i dont want to miss it.  but i dont have enough PTO here at work. ionno how im gonna get there and pay for the registration.  love life...is boring! no crushes no attraction.. oh i bought a tube dress yesterday! it was so cute, was 59.99 but i got it for $23.49 yiba!! i think thats what im gonna wear on Erwin and Ida's wedding. jomar is my date - my exbf - wahahhahh im a dork!  i just need to lose this bulging belly and wallah!! check me out!  oh and im gonna cut my hair this friday - ala judy ann santos.. yup yup that short! i'll post a pic on my friendster account so y'all can see! IM SO EXCITED!! hmmm i think my title for this blog does not match ahahahah.. oh well! its not summer blues after all..
Dream Of Me   by Kirsten Dunst   Let me sleep For when I sleep I dream that you are here You're mine  And all my fears are left behind  I float On air  The nightingale sings gentle lullabies So let me close my eyes  And sleep  Perchance,  to dream So I can see the face I long to touch To kiss But only dreams can bring me this  So let  The moon  Shine  Softly on the boy I long to see And maybe when he dreams He'll dream of me  I hide beneath the clouds And whisper to the evening stars They tell me love is just a dream away A dream away  So let  The moon  Shine softly on the boy I long to see And maybe when he dreams He'll dream of me  Oh...dream of me
In the story of your life, write the best book you can.  Have pages on understanding and the tales of overcoming hardships.  Fill your story with romance, adventure, poetry and humor.  Make each chapter reflect time well spent.                             frm:100 things to Always Remember  I was born October 15, 1979, no one in my family knows or remember the time or at least know if it was day or night. i guess im adopted. I didnt have much baby pictures because my mom said we were broke when they had me. I think my baby pictures started when i was already months old.  Let's think of it this way, i was not wanted in the family, i was an accident, they weren't prepared for me to come. Oh well, im here now. I grew up in the province of Cavite, on the little barrio of Malagasang II.  My dad has a auto-body shop, my mom is an accountant that works day and night. I was a sickly baby, had H-fever twice, almost died the second time. I grew up with my lola and tita's because my parents are rarely home for us. I think i started drinking coffee when i was 8.. pouring coffee on rice for breakfast. I went to Maranatha Christian Academy for Preparatory School and got 2nd honors. On my graduation, was the same day as my older sisters recognition day, i think she got 2nd also.  My mom had to be at two places at the same time. She chose to be with my ate. It was like we were getting the award at the same time and my award was given to me by my aunt who was wearing only her dress and a pair of slippers for she was just gonna watch the whole graduation rites.  Since then, when i enrolled at the public school to enter first grade, i didn't do well. I would pass all of my exams and subject but I never strived to get an award. My sister always get one, 2nd or 3rd but never the first. On first grade my dad was called to the office of the Principal because i started a fight with one boy in my class. Hey! i was doing a self defense! He hit my hand so i hit him in the face. and then he cried went home and told his mom! what a cry baby. and then 1986 came my mom left for Canada it was the Araw ng mga patay. November 1st 1986 in the morning, we were all in the airport, everyone was crying except for me.  i didnt care! i think.. anyways, life in elementary went on.. 3rd grade my dad w
