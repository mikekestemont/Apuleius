the comment was made that it would be a waste for me to abandon this blog.&nbsp; that's true, it is.&nbsp; it's been a good source for defending myself.&nbsp; but apparently it is taken so seriously by some people that they chose to get in their car, drive to lowe's, and interrupt dan while he's working to find out if he's okay.&nbsp; guys, dan chooses not to get involved with this blog nonsense for a reason.&nbsp; &nbsp;he can take care of himself.&nbsp; that's the reason that, if i do choose to post, they will be either impersonal or few and far between.  today is also my last day in my apartment.&nbsp; the reason makes me sad, but i won't discuss it here out of respect (and yes, i do respect you in that aspect) for the other person involved.  there are a few things i want to say before i sign off for awhile.....  danielle smith--i know you got back from france today.&nbsp; i hope you had a good time and that you and ray were able to work some things out.&nbsp; i'm happy right now and i honestly hope that you are too.&nbsp; i have chosen to create this blog in order to make sure both sides of the 'break-up story' were told.&nbsp; it was not created to lash out at anyone, including you.&nbsp; i've learned a very valuable lesson in the last couple of weeks....sometimes you have to let things go.&nbsp; i understand that you might have an opinion as to what is happening on these blogs.&nbsp; you know my email address and eric's if you have a comment.&nbsp; you and i have had our share of fights this year.&nbsp; we both know that i have never made a comment on your blog or ray's....or said anything spiteful or hateful about you on a blog anywhere else.&nbsp; we also both know that i have never responded on the blogs to anything that you have said about me.&nbsp; i'm politely asking you to do the same for me now.&nbsp; we've all been through enough.  dani darling--i just wanted you to know that i never once discouraged eric from being your friend.&nbsp; he will tell you that himself.&nbsp; he showed me the blogs that you wrote and the emails that you sent him and i asked him for months to tell you that he had a serious girlfriend.&nbsp; his reasoning was that you were not ready.&nbsp; i know you don't like me and yes, i have gotten mad when i read blogs that you wrote and it seemed like you were heaping alot of blame on eric, because he was telling me that you were always just a friend and that he hadn't even seen you in almost four years.&nbsp; i do understand that eric didn't speak to you for a long time while he and i were together.&nbsp; his refusal to tell you (and another girl that claimed to be in love with him) about our relationship made me insecure with our relationship.&nbsp; but i think that he may have thought that i was insecure with you.&nbsp; even though that wasn't the case, that might have been the misunderstanding.&nbsp; i know you just emailed eric recently telling him how you had felt about him.&nbsp; i hope that you will continue to be his friend and support him, because he really needs that right now.&nbsp; i've tried for three months to be his friend and encourage him....but i'm beginning to realize that my presence, whether in person or written, hurts him more, and i don't want that for him.&nbsp; this blog had not been intended to persuade people to choose sides.&nbsp; i was simply tired of my name and dan's being dragged through the mud and one side of the story being told.&nbsp; like eric said, quite fairly, this is my right, and i'm glad that he chose to link the spot to his so everyone could see it.&nbsp; but i am sorry that you had to hurt.&nbsp;   melanie--what can i say?&nbsp; God must have had a sense of humor when he made us sisters.&nbsp; thank you for your support for me, and dan, and eric.&nbsp; take care of scotti.&nbsp; we would be lost without him, too.  dan--you already know.&nbsp; much love.  eric--i'm sorry that i've made choices that hurt you.&nbsp; as far as my relationship with dan goes, the only thing i can apologize for is replacing you as soon as i did.&nbsp; you say that i should be sorry for ever beginning a relationship with him in the first place.&nbsp; you will never hear an apology for that one.&nbsp; you ask me not to lie to you.&nbsp; i did once, i'm not going to do it again.&nbsp; i will not apologize for something i am not sorry for.&nbsp; but i am sorry that you're making the choices that you are.&nbsp; you claim to love me and then tell me that you're going to kill yourself so that the blame will rest on my shoulders.&nbsp; i don't understand how that is love, and you're only making things worse for yourself.&nbsp; for the last three months you have had countless friends and family be there any time you need them and do their best to help you.&nbsp; you've chosen to ignore them.&nbsp; you claim to be open to other's opinions, but your retaliation to scotti's comments prove otherwise.&nbsp; you blame me for destroying your life, and then claim to be a christian and that you trust God.&nbsp; i just don't understand.&nbsp; but when i ask you these questions and you can't defend yourself with a good excuse, you try to turn things back around and point fingers at me.&nbsp; you keep telling me to destroy you....to say whatever i can to hurt you.&nbsp; i&nbsp;can't do that.&nbsp; there is enough hurt.&nbsp; i do love you and miss you as a friend.&nbsp; i wish things hadn't ended like this.&nbsp; but you can never say that i haven't been here whenever&nbsp;you needed me for the last three months, even though it&nbsp;hurt&nbsp;someone&nbsp;else that loves me, t
