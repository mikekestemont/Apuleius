Finally have gotten around to sharing my trip photos. See many posts under this. Mark and I went to Egypt last month (April 2004) for 2 weeks and it was really a great trip.  This is just a selection as I don't have all day to put them on here!  In fact I now have to go clean some walls to finally apply some tiles to the separate toilet, which will coordinate to the bathroom (these are in different rooms upstairs in this house, no idea why).  Mark has spent all day removing the old pink (ugh!) toilet and moving a drain pipe.  Like hours it has taken.  We can't tile the bathroom itself until next week as we have to wait for a plasterer to do some work, and he's coming Tuesday.  Fun times.
urlLink    I have dozens of photos, but here is a selection.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Nice hat lady.  It was REALLY hot and sunny though.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Karnak Temple, near Luxor.  Huge incredible hall of 134 columns like these.  Featured in James Bond and Agatha Christie movies.&nbsp; urlLink

urlLink    I love this sign in bad English translated from Arabic at the Valley of the Kings: 'Look at the glory of the ancient'&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Our Nile cruise ship, which we were on for 1 week.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Contrast between the Nile and its green banks, and the desert behind is amazing.  Egypt never goes hungry thanks to this irrigation though.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    View of Philae Temple (on an island) from a small boat&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Abu Simbel, amazing temple built into rock by Ramses II.  We were 45 kms from the Sudan, in the most southernly part of Egypt.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Snake charmer!  We paid him to take this and stayed FAR away.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Tutanhkamun's gold mask in the Antiquities Museum, Cairo&nbsp; urlLink

The DVLA (Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency) in this country is REALLY dumb.  They have figured out that most Canadians drive automatics, and so have restricted Canadians driving in the UK to only automatic cars unless you can prove with documentation that you passed your Canadian test on a manual car.  HOWEVER, they have not clued up to graduated licencing.  I exchanged a G2 Ontario licence for a full UK licence! ha ha!  The best part is that my G2 was going to expire this October, meaning if I didn't take a full G test in Ontario, I was going to be reduced to a G1 again.  And now if I go back to Canada, I can either get a G2 or a G licence automatically by exchanging my shiny new one (depending on how many year's driving experience I get here).  I just got it today.  So alas Mark's car is manual.  But at least I can drive a moped or a quad bike in the UK legally!  Not that I am planning to.
urlLink    Unbelievable!&nbsp; urlLink
This morning, in the free paper on the tube, the Metro (very high quality newspaper, ha ha), there was a whole feature on Canadian cuisine!  Excellent.  I actually asked Mark yesterday if he would be willing to skip off work one day next week for a 2 course lunch for Â£40 at Fortnum & Mason (the Queen's grocer of course, you know) cooked by the head chef from the Royal York.  It's some special thing in conjunction with an exhibit of Inuit art.  But alas I don't think we're going.  We probably would if it was a weekend.  We picked some decent tiles last night for the new bathroom, after much debate.  I think they will be okay.  It's more important that we make it look good for potential buyers anyway, not for ourselves.  Current good read on the tube to and from work: another brilliant book by Dave Eggers, called You Shall Know Our Velocity.   Great quote:  But I was getting tired.  We needed to get out of the water before we mistook it for a bed.  I was sure that was how people drowned; not with a fight, not with thrashing but with thoughts of rest.  I have always thought that!
urlLink    The welcome sign on the movie set today!  In Bucks. village of Penn Street, outside Penn House (owned by some Conservative Peer)&nbsp; urlLink
Don't mind me, playing with new toy that lets me post pics on my blog for free.  I need to get my butt in gear and put Egypt ones up soon then!

Still warm here, still hasn't rained.  And just when I finally get some dirt under my fingernails and want it to rain on my nice herbs and tomatoes!  We are growing basil, coriander, thyme, wild rocket, mint, sage and more.  They are looking pretty good too.  I never started growing anything from seed before.  So I took a little trip out to try to find the set of 'Nanny McPhee' urlLink  , which is Colin Firth and Emma Thompson's latest movie, filming in a little town not too far away from here called Penn Street.  But we got all the way out there and it was closed and I was scared off by people guarding the entrance so I chickened out and we went to a pub instead.  Oh well.  I have now seen Colin loads of times around London, so I am not actually all that disappointed, but it would have been cool to see.  And Emma T. too.  Putting in new bathroom this weekend which is very exciting, and Mark actually put the house on the market yesterday.  He says he is testing the waters to see if he gets any offers at a high asking price.  I say NO ONE is going to buy this place, there is t
