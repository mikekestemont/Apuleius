Requiem For An East Village Party Girl     Farewell to all of those nominal nights spent sinking into inner monologues. Mixing tar with sequences of a life I vied for. Brushing up against all those little boys whose mouths supersede their balls. All the pretty ugly girls too willing to show off scars in the safety of a low lit dingy bar.   I sat. I drank. I listened. There are things I will not share as I watched others prostitute their families and traumas for the sympathy of camaraderie. What I am is not to be passed around like disingenuous party favors. These vessels of synthetic empathy and I have nothing in common. With the exception of maybe a touch of alcoholism and those bags of blow that I hoped they would be kind enough to share.   I will not spend my days living in my self-medicated imagination anymore. My stupid little soul is such a drunken whore sometimes. She used to turn tricks while I pass out on the floor. She would sell my idle fears for beer and whiskey dick lovers that wanted nothing more than a warm place to cum in.   Those nights are over. I'll fight the gnawing urge to descend. I will be well behaved. I will be stable. I will relinquish this mnemonic slide show of waking dreams and take on a less numbing reality. From now on I will not cut myself into fragments in order to simplify my juxtaposition into someone else is life. I will create my own puzzle.I will live my own lies. I will buy my own drugs.
Ahimsa: The Hindu and Buddhist doctrine of refraning from harming any living being.     I stare into space.  Space is now tar against my face.  Shaken and bloody from the blow.   Car crash back seat Mona Lisa.  My will is to lie in wait.  I know I have to get up.  I rip myself apart.  I am not self destructive.  I simply enjoy the hope of recovery.  Tearing myself to shreds.  Helps me justify lieing in bed.  My painted on smile is not a smile at all.  It is a crimson snicker look a bit closer.  Tired so tired at 27.  Will I ever get better.  I guess it depends on my insides.  Hello in there? I am ready now.
Your Crazy Eyes..My New Year's Resolution.    I am the crazy girl you have been searching for.I am the virgin and the whore.I am the one who is not affraid of your lithium filled veins or that sick little heart that sticks to things like cellophane.There is nothing common about your steps.There is nothing normal about the way you embrace your broken mind in your ink stained arms.  You hold up your tortured boy scars up over your head for everyone to see.Maybe you don't impress them but you have slayed me. I picture you in an empty room alone shaking.Beautiful is not the word I am looking for but it is the first word that comes to mind. Jolted by the nervous ticks that seem as if they are the last involuntary twitches of your spirit. You breath smoke.I breath you.It's all the same death.I'd rather hold it in and die than let it out and live without the hope of having you inside of me.   I am locked up in a house of flames. I am fucked up and chained to the foot of the bed.The air is thin and my head is full of all those strange things I wish you hadn't said.I am writing this in the dark so that she can't see and try to keep you from me.It's too late I have pushed this as far as it can go and now my dress is on fire.Blistered,burnt and sore.I will burn here quietly until I can figure out a way to gather up my ashes and find a way back to that place where I held myself up with your stare.
Animus     Once within now without   Scathingly anguished metamorphosis  Here because you chose me In your world I have no grip and gravity is lost You led path paved, worn Prada clad footsteps I follow weary and ambivalent  I will enter when it is my turn I will exit when you have had your fill This is my will  Treading water in this sea of names Flesh, blood sweat and cum flailing arms and heavy hearts Iâ€™ve looked at you from every angle From desire to disgust Just when I think Iâ€™ve found a perfect center You thrust upon, shove away and dismantle all of my conclusions  This is not love only feeding (repeat 3 X)
STEVE    I hate birds. Feathers, cooing, wings flapping, beaks pecking and all the chalky air bound poop they procure disgusts me. That being said I must tell you about the creature that ruined a perfectly lazy Saturday morning. I was peacefully sleeping off a hangover when I heard a scuffle in the living room. At first I thought it was one of my roommateâ€™s failed attempts at weekend productivity. It was not until later that I realized she was away that weekend. My mind said â€œGet Upâ€? but my body screamed, â€œSNOOZEâ€?. As always the body won.   A few hours later I blindly stumbled into the kitchen to make a much needed pot of coffee. As I reached for the coffee filters I felt as though I were being watched. I looked over my shoulder to find none other than my nemesis perched atop the refrigerator a dirty, diseased, pecking, poop flinging pigeon.   Our eyes met. Rather my eyes met his one hungry little bead of a peeper. I froze then I screamed and then I preceded to try and shew it towards the window with a dishrag. Its wing span far more threatening than itâ€™s stationary stare. It is one thing to see a pigeon in a park and cringe but this was my kitchen. It was then that I realized that my feelings for these fury entities was not disdain but sheer terror. I w
