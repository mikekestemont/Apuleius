I do not know when and where in the course of human history man began to beleive in GOD. I am not interested to know either. But what bothers me is the fact that by believing in GOD man has started disbeleving himself. I do not think I am speaking out of pride or arrogance and I do not claim this to be an original thought either, but the thought seems to be more correct than wrong to me.    Men seem to have forgotten their own divinty by beleiving in God and the heavens. And worse, they have started dispising themeselves, their very own self. I wonder what makes generation to generation of humans to beleive so strongly in God and the heavens but not in themselves, their very self. Great achievements of human courage  and labour are ascribed to God and the heavens, when in fact the credit should have been to the human spirit.   Is it not time for us to review our faith and see why is that we have such an unflincing faith in God but not in ourselves and our abilities?  What scourges India is not the poverty, not the illiteracy nor corruption but the lack of faith of its men on themselves. Indians will better beleive their neighbours of a few hours than years of themselves. They are more concerned about the opinion of their friends, relatives and neighbours than their own will and wish. They have more faith in sadhus, saints and godmen when it comes to divinity and sprituality than in themselves.  Hindus should not prey if they do not understand their religion, its very essence, how it has come about and what it means. Hinduism is a book that has to be read and reflected upon rather than kept closed and preyed on as any holy book.
What is a relationship? Why do we want it? What has it come to pass? Where do we stand on this? What can be done to it? I have more questions than answers but for the questions that I have answers, I do have definite answers.  I do not beleive in love as it is put forward, the meaning that it usually conveys, literally meaning I guess. But I do believe in the affection that comes forth out of a deeper understanding of the other person.  For a relationship to worthy enough it has to have the love, respect and understanding as it essence. I believe a long standing relatonship has these at its base, huge and strong, cannot be shaken at all.  Why do we need a relationship? May be we want to live a life, life in its full glory, with all its grief and happiness. We want a mate to share our sorrow & joy, our thoughts, and to provide us comfort and security and a feeling of being part of something, being valuable as a person and much more.  What matters in a partner? As humans we wish to live a fulfilling life. 50-60 years down the line we would like to feel content about the way we have lived our lives, what we have become. We wish a feeling of joy reflecting on us, joy from our actions, from our lives and from our relationships. We would like to feel content, we would like to feel a life worth lived. Towards this goal, we wish to have partner who respects us and our feelings. A partner who values our  aspirations and believes in us. On who is very understanding and loves us for what we are. One on whom we can have immense faith.   Does anything else matter for us? Then why are we scared to get into any relationship? May be we are not sure of ourselves and our decisions, we are also scared of people around us, friends, relatives and people in general.  What if the relationship fails? What if the partner does not turn out to be what we had expected? What would others think? Can I live a life which is looked down upon by all others who I know?  But then we need to believe in ourselves, we will commit mistakes and we do, we have the right to. The mistakes would be painful but we need to bear them, its part of life else happiness will loose its meaning, it makes us deserve the joy, and the ecstasy. We cannot give away our life to others for the fear of pain, we cannot scared of committing mistakes. We need to take our lives in our own hands, let us make decision and let us not blame anyone else for it. Lets live life as we want, as we want it to be. At the end of the day if not for anything  at least we would be satisfied that we have done what we thought was the best and what we thought was correct. And this means we would have lived a life to the full. We need to have the passion for our lives and what we want to make out of it.
Hi all,  I am puttng forward a few thoughts borne out of a combination ofrealizations and experiences that I have had last couple of months andAyn Rand's Objectivism.Ayn Rand's Objectivism has been very influential in the way I think and the way I look at life. It has provided answers to many questions and definitely makes good fact.  I would be delighted to share the thoughts but please be aware that you might feel&nbsp;the thoughts are outrageous or they are out of pride or arrogance. The thoughts also have the potential to affect your believes and are hence potentially dangerous in case you do not get it right or get it completely.   In this mail I am putting forward one set of it, if you guys like it or hate it then I will put forth more. If you are indifferent then I will stop. The reason I am putting forward is my impression that you guys are better at a f
