What a lovely weekend.  Seriously?  Lovely.  Let's relive it, shall we?  It's not like I have work to do or anything.  Friday night, Lu Beth ditched me for freshly shaven Johnny Damon, so I was forced to settle for Shawn.  (Kidding!)  He and I drove out to the Charlie Horse in Bridgewater and had dinner... mmm scallops.  Afterwards, he graciously let me beat him in the arcade at racing, air hockey, skeeball, and shooting things.  Then we went to the pool hall and played a few games each of 8- and 9-ball.  I wasn't very clear on all the rules of 9-ball before, so I'm glad that now I know.  It's a fun game, but it seems a little unfair, since one player could clear the table, but if the other person just sinks the nine ball, they win?  I don't know.  I'm not complaining or anything; I had a very, very good time.  :)  Saturday I woke up on time to catch my bus to New York, but there was some confusion about the directions to South Station, and because I was going to end up having to take a later bus, I decided not to make the trip.  I felt bad when I talked to Erin later in the day and she reminded me that she's going away for the summer, but it really wasn't going to be a very good trip for me.  It would have been almost 12 hours on a bus just to go to NYC for dinner?  And as much as I wanted to see Erin and Christine... with the new job and everything else that's going on, it just wasn't a good time.  (Besides, they were already at home and in bed at 1:45am when I called them!)  Anyway, I went home and went back to sleep and then ran some errands.  I talked to Laurie and we decided to go and see  Lizzie Borden: The Musical  at the  urlLink Stoneham Theater .  Truthfully, I didn't know how great it was going to be, but now I'm so glad we went.  Lizzie was played by Jayne Patterson, who played Fantine in  Les Miz  on Broadway--and she was awesome!  There was also a character in the play, young Lizzie, sort of a ghost of older Lizzie's childhood, played by a local seventh grader (Andrea Ross) who was absoutely fabulous.  Besides the great acting, the music and book were entertaining, and the theater was beautiful, clean and comfortable.  Overall, a lovely experience!  And we had third row seats!  I was a little disappointed we didn't get blood spattered, but whatev.  I was secretly hoping they'd make us wear ponchos like at a Gallagher show or something...  heh.  Anyway again, after the show, Laurie and I drove to Brockton   (an aside:  gas.  costs.  over.  2.  dollars.  it costs me.  30.  dollars.  to fill.  my tank.  I DRIVE A CAMRY!!)  to pick up Shawn.  We were starving at that point, so we drove to Shawn's first destination suggestion: the China.  Mmmm, bar pizza, is there a food greater than you?  No.  So tiny, so thin, so greasy, so delicious with parmesan cheese...  Ahem.  I got to meet Pat, Shawn's old roommate who's name has come up a few times, and who happened to show up at the bar, which was cool.  Also, tequila shots?  Yay.  Sunday I had breakfast with Megan, Caitlin, Erin, and Shawn in Randolph, and then Shawn and I drove to Nantasket and Land's End, encountering a surprising amount of offensive art on the way.  Hee!  And Fort Revere?  Fun.  ;)  After our drive, I took Shawn home and Laurie and I went to see Shrek 2 in Braintree.  Shrek 2: eh.  Not nearly as funny as the first one, but worth the price of admission to watch Puss-In-Boots (Antonio Banderas) lick himself.  Hee!  Unfortunately, it is currently Monday.  My back hurts and my fingernail is broken.  Boo!  But at least there's a long weekend coming up!!  Does anyone know what night WaterWorks opens?
I got to talk to KT on the phone last night!  Well, actually this morning around 12:45am.  The first time I called I got my ass hung up on, but the second time, KT picked up and it was lovely.  We talked for a bit about some things that were going on with me, but it got a little awkward because of the 3 or 4 second delay over the phone card.  Also, KT sounded a little distracted near the end.  She said that it's sort of hard to come to the capital city and get all her phone calls and mail and banking and computer and everything and then go back to the village and have nothing.  I think she might have just been talking about being overstimulated.  I'm sure it is very difficult for her.  I wonder what it's going to be like when she comes back to the United States?  It sounds like it might be a pretty tough transition.  Saturday morning I'm  taking the bus  (ugh) to New York, which completely sucks.  Sorry to everyone I'm visiting and whatnot, but this trip is going to be very expensive and very short.  It's tough because I don't really want to have a weekend away, but I know that I should go and s
