(if i told you, dont bother reading the following part) well well well, seems as thopugh you've found my thoughts page, by the way please visit my sponsers, my other websites, copy and paste the link, i cant b bothered making it a proper link http://www.markusmaus.tk or http://www.markjamescheetham.tk  well well well, read on then, i'm not stopping you, am i? sorry if i am, or am i? anyway, my day today was alright, not espically good, apart from when i 'accidentally' kicked alex whilst i was walking up the stairs, he was behind me and my foot just happened to push back and kick him in his groin, that must of been painful for him, he was in agony for a bit, wat a shame, *ahem* maybe not, ok no it wasnt a sham, it was quite funny, then my foot kept kicking alex for some odd reason, he eventually got the message and went off to maths, and left me in peace, but it was too late, i'll explain another time. O yeah, my hand 'accidentally' clenched up into a fist in business studies and hit alex a 'couple' of times on his arm, such a watse of energy, i could of just thumped him in the face, and he would of shut up. Well i had a nice kip on the bus this mornin, i'll also explain another time, anyways must dash, its off to bed, ok to play on my ps2 or maybe sleep, i dunno which yet
*stresses* if you hate quick time player, then thats alright, because i fucking hate it. I mean, why the fuck can i not open my .mpeg files?, just necause i changed the fil name doesnt mean i cant open it, how come windows media player, lets me play them, stupid quicktime, the quicker that they let me play my movie, the better, because then i can actually start editing them, but grrrr quicktime, joiin me in destroying the company, unless it lets me play my movies.
So, the answer to that question which all of you have been wondering recently, well those of yout that know me, "How's Life", mwhahahahahaha u wont get the actual answer to the actual question till i pluck up the courage to ask her, for those of you who dont know who, ask me and i shall tell, 'markus_maus@hotmail.com' mwhahahahahaha, well people, life is a mixture of good and bad, good, when i'm in a happy mood, and bad, well you get the idea, when i'm in a bad mood, anyways, i'll explain why another time

i'm rather bored right now and vic, who is from middlesbrough for those of you who dont already know, wont tell me what this thingy on her web blog is about, so shes made me curious

hmm, whats happened in my life since i last wrote in this convient little space i seem to of acquired for a very small cost, ok it was free but thats not the issue here, anyway back to whats happened in my life, well, nothing much, still havent found out if this rumour is true, but i've been listening to 'The Who - Who Are You' & 'The Who - I Can See For Miles', both top songs, anyway, still bored now, but writing things in here takes a lot of effort, and i seem to have a little phrase on my hand, 'remember you are not a salmon', thanks to laura for that, hehehe tripeed up little rachael again today, not as effective as yesterday though, tripped her up as she was getting off the bus, was amusing, anyway think i'll go now, so i guess its good bye from me and also from me, good bye.
GHOSTBUSTERS, such a good song i suggest that you all go and download it now because  "if theres an invisilble man sleeping in your bed, who you gonna call? ghostbusters" or me if your eally want, but  "if theres something strange in your neighbour hood, who you gonna call? ghostbusters", now time for some reflection: this week we say thanks to Alice who has been able to help me out with a little problem that i have, lets hope the solution works ;) We also say thanks to Vic, who has been vic, which is good, because i can talk a lot about random things, so lets give them both a round of applause *claps* anyway to round of this fine staurday evening, i will say "GHOSTBUSTERS" good night and thank you all *bows*
