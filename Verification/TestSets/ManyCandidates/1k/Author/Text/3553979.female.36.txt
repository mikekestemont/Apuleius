That is what I am typing with.  Dishpan hands.  I have just finished washing most of the dirty dishes which were covering every possible spot in the kitchen.  Very tired.    Tomorrow, we are attending a wedding shower/potluck dinner.  We are each supposed to be bringing a place setting which we have aquired from tag sales or thrift stores etc.  It is supposed to be fun and you try to bring the silliest setting, cheapest setting or whatever.  Still, for a family of 5, it just wears you out thinking of how you will get around to it.  We went to the thrift store the other day and Noah just picked out everything for us all.  I would not have chosen what he did, but then, I had to run around the store after a preschooler who wanted everything there.  So, we still have to find some forks somewhere.  Thrift stores never  have forks.  Hmmm...
This is actually kinda funny.  I must have had a "brilliant idea" for a post, because this title was saved as a draft with nothing written besides the title.  Now, did I actually think that I was going to remember what I wanted to write without even giving myself a hint!?  However the old Magnificent Brain (to borrow from Clifford B. Hicks books about Alvin Fernald)has thought of something to write after all.  I know you are thrilled.  Here it is: What happens to those brilliant ideas which come into one's mind when the body is about to drift off to sleep?  I have them all the time.  I mean, they are the ones which would make me rich and famous, you know?  Somehow, though, I am not rich or famous.  So, what *does* happen to those ideas?  Well, my theory is this.  Once you think your brilliant idea, you have to trap it on a piece of paper or it will simply flutter on out into the world and go into someone else's thoughts and become their brilliant idea.  Yours no longer.  See?  You only have a small window of opportunity, before the idea gods take it back and give it to someone else anyway.      Sometimes, I think they make mistakes.  Like when you think of a fabulous new product that humankind cannot live without and you are so excited that you can't think straight.  Then, the next day while you are thumbing through a magazine, you see the product in an exciting new product list.  Now why on earth did the idea gods give you the idea *AFTER* it was already produced???!   Even if you trap the idea on a slip of paper, you have limited time in which to bring it to fruition (if it really is a good idea anyway).  Otherwise, they just go ahead and let someone else have it.  This can suck, but we shouldn't be stingy.  So there you have it. Cheers.
urlLink The Bear's Tale: Intro
Okay, so I am slow getting started with the blogging life.  I've been doing some silly stuff along with all the regular torture I am subjected to by my daughters.    I watched the Yahoo IM Live for six nights.  I am not a TV watcher, so it is weird that I sat there for that kind of thing.  However, Mark and Darron were really really funny and I was so entertained that my housework is out of control now.  At least they won.  I would have been so disappointed if they didn't.  The day before yesterday, my Daughter Katja (almost three) decided to "change the diapers" of a couple of stuffed animal cats.  I was sitting right there in the room with her, but somehow I failed to notice her applying vast quantities of A&D ointment to the bottoms of the stuffed animals.  By the time I noticed, half the tube of ointment was gone!  Then, that very same day at snacktime, she grabbed the jar of peanut butter from the table while I was talking to her father on the phone.  Again, I was standing *right there*.  She scooped out an enormous handful of peanut butter and was eating it out of her hand when I noticed!  Sigh.

When the almost-three-year-old wakes you up in the morning at 5:29am, you will wish you had gone to bed at 9:00pm rather than 12:30am.  Yes, you guessed it. I have a daughter who is almost three years old.    She gets up when she feels the faintest glimmer of light on her eyelids.  I think I am going to put black construction paper on the window. Last night I added an extra curtain panel in hopes that it would cut the light.  I don't think it did.  So, now I will resort to the construction paper technique.  I keep thinking that I will do something about it, then the next morning dawns and bing! she's awake at 5:30am again.  Today, though, I am definitely doing it.    Well, time for a family walk.

I seem to have a great capacity for sitting and staring at the computer screen for hours.&nbsp; I said to myself while putting babies to bed, "Self, it is seven o'clock and you are going to go downstairs and wash dishes and clean up that kitchen.&nbsp; You can't use the computer.&nbsp; Well, okay, you can just check your email and then look at Nervousness.org &nbsp;for a very few minutes.&nbsp; That is IT though!"&nbsp;   Okay, so one hour and forty-six minutes later I am *still* sitting here.&nbsp; Also, I did not really accomplish anything.&nbsp; It would be okay if I had already written this post, maybe.&nbsp; But look!&nbsp; I am just getting started!&nbsp; Rant rant rant.   Anyway, lately I have been up to this:&nbsp; Last Tuesday I had surgery to get my tubes tied.&nbsp; It sounds so crass, but there it is.&nbsp; I was quite adamant about doing this, so don't worry.&nbsp; I am almost 37 years old and I have had two children and two cesareans.&nbsp; I do not want any more cesareans or children.&nbsp; The worst&nbsp;part of the operation w
