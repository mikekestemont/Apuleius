I had a good time tonight with D-bo.  We went out for Pizza and saw Jermaine there.  He is tuly the most electrified man in all of the Fredonia Pizza circles!  D-bo and I got talking and ended up on the meaning of the Jar of Flies title to an Alice in Chains Album.  Here's a clip from an interview with AIC former front man Layne Staley with Hit Parader.  HP: First off, where did the title Jar Of Flies come from?   LS: It came from a science experiment (AIC guitarist) Jerry Cantrell did  when he was in the third grade. They gave him two jars full of flies.  One of the jars they overfed, the other jar they underfed. The one they  overfed flourished for a while, then all the flies died from  overpopulation. The one they underfed had most of the flies survive all  year. I guess there's a message in there somewhere. Evidently that  experiment had a big impact on Jerry.
It seems like today was non stop running, or actually hobbling around in my case.  The high point was grabbing some good Chinese take out for lunch with R at the Holy Wong, which is my favorite take out place in the D + F area.  This afternoon, I bounced between work, the laundromat, and my place trying to get stuff done, so I can feel like I am getting ahead.        I forgot to mention this previously, but I saw a great trailer by V for a doc she is doing about gay and lesbian weddings in the New Paltz area.  If I can find the URL again, I will have to post it.         A couple of interesting things I noticed while going around D + F earlier -   1) The Village Limits neon sign is gone, and now there is a new neon sign that says Valentine's.  It will always be Village Limits to me.  I have so many good memories of that place.  Remember the times we would guess how many mullets we could see in one night?  How about the Fish doing his thing to the Cha Cha slide on the stage?  Could I ever forget the time when Salim hit on two girls that were dancing and he then got invited to their wedding?  ...K-Lo dancing on the bar at her 21st b-day while she was wearing a huge yellow foam cowboy hat that had her address on the side of and said If found please return to.   The great numerous happy hours there for the free food.  I recall the time Gman got yelled out by Junior because he thought G was a Dolphin's fan.  All the times with TJ, Steph, and Mel D were awesome too.  Village - we will remember you!  RIP Village Limits.  2) Arby's In Fredonia no longer offers baked potatos!  This truly bothers me for the fact that Vegetarians should be able to eat unhealthy fast food and suffer the consequences of ill health just like their carniverous counterparts.  I wonder if this is a regional thing or national thing. On the topic of fast food, I am hoping to catch SuperSize Me at the Opera house this weekend.
Cool!  I just found out K-Lo is going to the same Bills game I am.  Hopefully we'll be able to meet up before the game for some fun tailgate action!   K-lo, if you want to hustle some people in a pickup football game in the parking lot before the game, let me know.        I just got back from getting my Haircut.  Yes, its been about a couple weeks, so it was needed ; ) I did end up going to Charlie's, but I was really considering going back to Famous Hair.  Last week, my ex that manages there stopped by my place to talk.  It was the first we've talked since we split.  Surprisingly, it was a really good time and didn't feel awkward at all.  She said that one of my favorite girls that work there was bothering her to talk to me to get me back there.  I know I will end up going back sometime, because Mary cuts the best hair in town - I should know since I have been to almost every place around.      The mystery of the wildflowers has been solved.  Last week, I saw some flowers left at the door going up to my place.  I wasn't sure if they were for me or one of my neighbors.  It turns out they were for my neighbor.  I'm relieved.  This means no stalker for me!  Yeah!
After work today, I went to see my Physical Therapist.  The appointment went well.  So far, its just Ultrasound and some shock treatment to work the muscles.  Tony was really surprised how much voltage I was taking with the shocks.  He stood back and looked me up and down in disbelief, as he said my whole leg should be kicking with the amount of electricity going to my foot.  I think this could be an indicator of two things.  Either I can attribute it to my high tolerance for pain, or that I actually did damage nerves more than I thought when I screwed up some of the disks in my spine.  I'm personally hoping more for the high tolerance option.         Not too much else happened tonight.  I grabbed some Subway with a good veggie sub, had some good spaghetti, went to the driving range, and lifted some weights.  Overall, it was a good laidback night.  I didn't do too well at the driving range, but I did manage to hit my last ball at least a couple hundred yards into the darkness with the five iron, so that was a good note to end on.  I also tried calling Mr B, but all the cell phone circuits in Las Vegas must have been busy.
I've been thinking about blogging it for a while, and after a good cheese calzone I decided this was the day to do it.             Anyways, Its sad to see the weekend dwindling away.  Yesterday, w
