Just one look into your eyes &nbsp;One look and i'm crying 'cause you're so beautiful  Just one kiss and i'm alive One kiss and i'm ready to die 'cause you're so beautiful Just one touch and i'm on fire One touch and i'm crying' cause you're so beautiful Just one smile and i'm wild. One smile and i'm ready to die 'cause you're so beautiful Oh and you're so beautiful My darling Oh you're so beautiful You're so beautiful Oh my baby You're so beautiful And you're so beautiful Oh my darling Oh my baby And you're so beautiful Beautiful by H.I.M  I love this song. Just because I cut to it and it make me feel..justified. In an odd way.&nbsp; It's ironic for sure and it is great to sing along and watch the knife bite into my wrist. It really is. Great release. But I lost my knife. I haven't any clue about how long I have gone without cutting or even my knife but it is driving &nbsp;me near hysterical. I feel like something is missing...like I am lost. My knife is like my security blanket. I don't feel right without it. I have been keeping myself busy though, my annoying company finally left. FINALLY. He tried to make me hug him. HA! Wasn't gonna happen. I only hug people who I think deserve it or people whom I don't know.  "It's like its hands are behinds it back holding a sharp butcher knife and is about to pounce and tear you to shreds any moment :)" I siad that to a freind a moment ago. What a&nbsp; twisted mind I have. I mean I said that when she pointed out that the :D face on MSN is scary. Whenever I blog on this paticular blog I always become me. Not Her but me. I am rarely me. I can't be me. Maybe thats why I like to act and dance. I dont have to be me and feel guilty about not being me. I have reason not to be me. No one would like me. I hate people who think I am less of an equal then them. I hate it, there isn't any reason for thoughts like that.  Currently I have a mosquito sucking blood from my arm. Maybe I'll get West Nile Virus, and die. With my luck I probably won't. Oh well. The mosquito has been here for a while, maybe I shall name her Drucilla. Yes. she'll be like my other friends, come to suck my blood and then fly away, leaving me with a sore spot. ..That's not really fair. I do have some good friends. Especially Alesha. She is my bestest truest friend. I've&nbsp; known her since kindergarden and I am extremely glad I met her.&nbsp;So thank you Alesha for being my true friend, and for letting me be me. I know you will never read this but maybe If I do end up dying by my own hand you'll find this because I told you about it. I know thats morbid or something but i feel blank again, and when I get blank I get semi-morbid.  I had a nice long bath and now I am so clean that I rival Mr. Clean, or I could at least become his mistress. I have my Drama/Dance preformance tomorrow. Alesha and Carrie say that they are going to come watch. I don't want them to, yet I do. I have to stand still for a very long time, I can't fidget, talk or look around. I have to Focus. Ms. Lihou says that that is her 'F' word. I agree. I have good focus. At least I think I do. Not much distracts me. Although once I start smiling sometimes I take a while to stop....thats is of course assuming I DO smile...I guess I smile alot though, but it is never a 'happy' smile. Just one of those fixed ones. Unless it is something that strikes me paticularly funny about the situation, and that happens fairly often...at all the wrong times. My smiles around lots of people who expect me to smile fade within seconds. You know the saying or old wives tale or whatever it is that is something like 'If you are grumpy then smile and you'll feel better' &nbsp;That doesn't work for me, in fact, and I quote "You do grumpy like no one else."&nbsp;But it is true, if I smile while I am upset it just makes it worse. I feel fake. I hate feeling fake. Feeling fake makes me feel...gross. Slimy and artificial, plastic and silicon or however you spell it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I wish I was ice, numb from the inside. I think that would be the perfect way to live. Not worrying about anything...not caring. Not thinkging about the millions of children dieing every minute or the thousands of animals slaughtered uselessly for the million of people who are already to fat and shouldn't be eating anymore or else their greedy little hearts would explode. I wish they would. I shouldn't start myself on the unfairness and stupidity of the world and its many economies and governments. I will babble on forever and bore myself to the tears that won't come under any other circumstance. I am a self pitying fool, and I am quite aware of it. Quite aware. How couldn't I be, with friends that are constantly telling me that I am giving off the grumpy vibe and that I am never happy. You know sometimes I wonder if they even realize that they aren't helping in t
