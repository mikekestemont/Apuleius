My life has come to a standstill. (Or has it always been at a standstill?) I know I have goals. I even know that I have plans to achieve these goals. But I'm just not sure what they are. I know that they exist, just beyond the realm of my consciousness, and that all I have to do is seek them and I can pull them from the corners of my brain out into the open. I just haven't done it yet. I know there are things I want to do with my life, and I have a vague idea what they are, but I haven't put in the simple effort necessary to organize my thoughts and dreams and actually begin to realize them. Each day I think,  I should write something today , but then I find myself spending another day and night sitting at the computer and accomplishing nothing. I think of it, but I tell myself, "No, wait 'til tomorrow. It's too late now; you can spend all day tomorrow on this." But I never get to it. I want to make something of my life, I want to change the world, but...but I'm afraid that I'll never actually  start  anything, and I'll end up just like my parents: holding boring jobs in office buildings, working a standard eight hour day, hating my job but lacking another option. Lacking the discipline to build another option.   But what the hell is the point of sitting here  blogging  about this? Why not just get off the computer and actually  start?  See, that's why I mean. I'm just so messed up right now. I'm such a procrastinator, that I almost will myself to continue putting everything off until the last minute. But when you don't have a deadline for something, there  is  no last minute, so you just never accomplish it. You end up achieving only the minimum. I don't want to live the bare minimum.  Ahh! Help me! I'm losing my mind!
I guess I've always thought that while people were quite different from me, they all led similar lives. But it just now occurred to me that  not everyone's like me . Which is weird, because I've always regarded myself as somewhat unique, you know. Not at all like the average person. But I've just never really thought about it. Many people--maybe most people--are actually social, active people leading busy, eventful lives. People actually  do  things everyday. People actually have self-confidence and -esteem. People actually  like other people . People are actually  happy . I don't know why this is such an amazing realization for me. It just is. What a dumb revelation.   I wish I could live life like that.
I was just talking with my dad, and we had the following exchange:  Dad: I feel like I can really relate to you. Because you're very intelligent. Me: Yeah, and you can relate to Andy because he likes sports. Dad: He's very intelligent, too! Me: Haha. Good one, Dad. Dad: Well, he is intelligent, in his own way!  Haha. I love when I get my parents to say that kind of thing about my brother. It just makes my day.  Until I forget about it and it has absolutely no effect on my day after all. Hm.
This evening, I went to my twenty-something-year-old cousin's house for a family barbecue type thing. Oh, how I love family get togethers.  Sarcasm doesn't show up in print. Darn.  It's really annoying to be a vegetarian at a barbecue. Especially with my family, who seem to live to torture me. If I have children, I promise that I will  never  purposely humiliate them or piss them off in social situations. Mark my words.   Right before we went home, we had a stupid group picture taken. I can never smile in pictures. I can't smile unless I'm truly happy. Needless to say, I was not truly happy at the moment. Anyway, the woman who was taking the photo told me that I needed to smile. I was  trying  to smile. She said, "You're so serious!" When will people stop mistaking unhappiness for solemnity?   When we finally left, my cousin said something along the lines of, "It was nice to see you, Elm." It was understood by everyone that he was joking. Elm being good company? What a ludicrous idea! Elm's not fun! What a great joke! I hate my family. Every last one of them. And they seem to hate me right back.   On a lighter note...Nope, I got nothing.  Current... Reading material:  To Kill a Mockingbird  by Harper Lee Greatest desire that cannot be fulfilled: To sleep through the rest of my life Greatest frustration: Too many to decide Inspiration: None, and it drives me nuts Plans for the future: None, and it drives me nuts Focus in life: None, and it drives me nuts Attitude toward the whole of humankind: Hatred Completely illogical desire: Conflict--any sort of break from the charade of everyday life Thing that I wish I could sit down and do but feel incapable of doing: Writing--a story, a song, a poem, whatever Physical condition: Good Mental condition: Fair Emotional condition: Poor
urlLink VW  and I just wrote a screenplay called  From Ruben to Clay . Oh, I love that idea. We worked on it for ten hours, only taking breaks to eat and sleep. We even chose people we know to play each part. Of course, it was a spoof...and we thought it was pretty funny at the time. Or at least I did. Of course, when we read it over (out loud and to my mother, no less) we realized what it was: stupid. Really, really, patheticly stupid. Ten wasted hours. I feel like such an idiot.
Today I went to the beach with Kate. It was kind of cloudy and a little windy, but it turned out alright. There was a group of girls near us. Three of them buried the other one...and gave her little piles of sand as boobs. It was pretty funny to watch. So, o
