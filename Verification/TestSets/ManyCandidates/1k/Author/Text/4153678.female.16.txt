For one thing i'm really glad that everything is finally over today. Had a long day today. Well though i studied much more and spent much longer time on Chem than Maths, Chem test done more badly than Maths. Ironic huh? Couldnt believe it myself too. Well there was a structural question on Alkenes and i didnt study that entire chapter. So i most probably lost lots of marks there. *sigh* Why muz they set questions on chapters i didnt finish studying? I finished all the chapters for Chem except that. And as a result i neglected my Maths. Thot i'll let down Mr Seow more than Miss Koh. Now i think it's the reverse.   After the CT i had IPW. GUess i have quite a lot cuz i was absent for MOnday's pw session and the group had finished almost most of the written report. Yupx. So this week is my turn to do my part of the written report. After that had tuition, then met up with Sing Yi at Starbucks @ Plaza Singapura.  Went to Yamaha to find music books later then went to Burger King to study. After that cuz Sing wanna watch the[ 倚天屠龙记] so we left @ 6.30pm. Hmn.. well thru out the entire outing with her today we really catched up quite a lot on each other. HAhaz.. even discussed bout our future and our family's finance problems...   All i could say is that i really enjoyed the outing with Sing Yi. Hahaz... That is what happens when true close friends confide in one another.  Guess we're a pair of confidants, yeah Sing Yi?? ^_^   Then me went home and till now lolz... hahaz.... gonna study today too.. do some homework, at least complete something today. Yup.   Oh Yesterday i managed to find the entire full song for  「爱上张无忌」 !!! Was so nice!!! It's prob the nicest song i've ever heard. Love the orchestra and 毛阿敏's vocal. SO powerful and shiok!!   Hahaz..me was even playing and replaying this song while studying yesterday. Simple just love this song...   OkaEz then,... gtg le. Have to start doing work cuz not early already. See Ya then. Nitez...
My 革命 journey is definitely yoyo and wavy. Last Wednesday i reached 64 Kg, i lost 0.5 kg from the previous week. But now, in just two days, i'm @ 66Kg!! ALL TIME HIGHEST!! OH GOSH!!!!!!!   I think probably it's because i've been 暴饮暴食 due to all the stress. It's definitely not good for health and i can feel all the food a strain to my heart. I've to cut down tomolo.   I'm supposed to lose to 62kg end of this week. But for now, after tomorrow's fateful day, i'll just try to cut down to my original weight. And from tml onwards i MUST learn to control my diet and studies. Firstly i dont want to die early cuz of my obese side and of course i wanna go well for my studies. Promos coming in less than 42 days. Have to start preparing now..   Right now, i'll just have to die for my test tml. Can't finish studying @ all. It's 7 pm and i've not finished chem and i've not even started studying maths yet.    *haiy*   pray that i can move closer to Hakuna matata and not drift away from it.....
到现在，革命真的很多波折。一切还没有什么进展。为何呢？我想是和我的自律有关。这拜六有化学和数学测验，可是化学都才刚开始读，数学也还没开始，想必这次也不会考好了。天啊！！ 一定要帮我度过这难关！   好了，今天的笔记也得短了，因为今天要赶课了，要临时报佛脚了！！！
Well.. i didnt go school today.. hence my blog title "guilty". There are a few reasons for my absence. I'm not exactly sick but i was a little tired. Emphasis on the word little. The real and main reason was because i didnt study @ all for the entire weekend cuz of the concert blah blah and i definitely can't finish my studies for chem and maths Common test this sat. Yupx. I really want to do well for my CT. So i pretended to be very tired and used my elbow injury as an excuse. I really wanted to tell mom the real reason. But will she accept it? Nope. I can assure u that. If she is more open and understanding to why i chose to miss the longest day i have in school for my studies and if she is to be less hot and short tempered and stubborn, i will have definitely told her the real reason. I hate to lie. Who likes anyway, especially to your closest kin. Guilty again.      I only told Sing Yi the truth. By far she's the only one i know i can tell who can understand me. Of cuz there is xueling. But cuz Singyi sms me just now to ask bout my concert hence i just  顺便  told her.       Yupz..so now i'm really make use of this day. I've already wasted half a day sleeping. I originally only planned to sleep till 8 am cuz i wasnt tired at all but ended up sleeping more. Actually i'm used to 3 to 4 hours of sleep already. Long ago. But okay sometimes i must admit there are exceptional cases where i really do feel tired. *Haiz* I know it's not right skipping school to catch up with work but i have no other choices. Well, luckily for chem and physics lect those chapters have been already covered in tuition. Hence i won't miss much.       Okay.. gtg already... Mom's back from market and i seriously need to work hard today. See ya.
Just typed a para just now but an accidental "backspace " deleted everythin... *haiz*      Well does today's blog title puzzle u again?? Hahaz.. well this is by far the most suitable title i can think of over  what happened over the past few days..      Let's start with Friday...CLDDS concert was generally ok.. except that feedback given  was that the male actor KAng Ming changed too slow.. they said the actress was faster.. gee.. but u should have seen the speed that He changed!!! It was so fast lorx ! Really an eye opener for me! i put my hats off him mann!! However think Friday's concert was a lottle unsteady for him. At one of t
