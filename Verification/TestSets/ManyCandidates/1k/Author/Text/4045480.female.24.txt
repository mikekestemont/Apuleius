Well here I go again, another few cents into the ever-growing pile. Today the Chicago Cubs acquired Nomar from the Red Sox in a four-way trade with the Redsox, Expos, and Twins. It was a very complex trade, but in the end Nomar is now a Cub. I'm totally excited about it except for the fact that he has an Achilles problem. The Cubs are just starting to get their guys healthy again, do we really need another awesome player that can't play because he's on the injured list? I really hope Hendry knows what he's getting into, and that we aren't buying another "Casey at the Bat" aka Sosa. These guys better start playing better fundamental baseball, or we'll have to look to next year yet again. But I'm a Cubs fan, I should be used to the "next year" concept by now.  Moving on...the golf season has progressed nicely. Yes I'm a sucker for the PGA tour. I grew up with my dad watching baseball, golf, and football. I could always tell summer was around the corner when we would have golf tourneys on the TV for background noise during dinner:) This year the Masters, which I honor every year by wearing my Masters hat during the tourney, saw one of my favorite golfers, Phil Michelson, win with a fabulous putt at 18. I teared up at that moment, and also when Arnold Palmer, my favorite golfer of all time, made his last putt at the Masters. Yes I am a sap, and yes I cry at great moments in sports. Other than that it's been a lot of watching Tiger Woods fall further into his slump. I think the little woman is wearing him out, hehe. And there have been a lot of unknowns winning majors, a very sporadic year to say the least.  Lastly, there is my most beloved sport of all...football. Yes, training camp is hear folks, and already my two favorite teams are loosing players. The Dolphins lost Ricky Williams, I'm thinking it was the drug problem embarrassment that sent him packing, and if not, that was a shitty thing to do to your teammates, to run out on them, definitely not cool. Then there is Da Bears, as if it wasn't bad enough that my favorite player on the team had to lower himself by dating Paris Hilton last year, but now Brian Urlacher has been put on the injured list. Great, not even two days in and already we have issues. I'm still holding out hope that the Bears have a chance with all the new staff this year, thank god Shoop is gone, but as for the Dolphins we'll just have to wait and see, but I wouldn't want to be Dave W. right now, yikes!  Alright, I think that covers all my bases except for college football, but I've known for quite some time that Illinois is in need of talent, and really don't hold out much hope for them either, but they can always surprise me, or not. I'd love to see all my favorite teams win, but I know I have a thing for underdogs, and I'm okay with that. Until next time...
Alright, so from reading my bio you probably could tell that I'm a recent college grad, that I have and am going to again be involved with unionized labor (yes where I come from&nbsp;zookeeping is a union job much like teaching), that I'm going to be a science teacher (chem and bio In case I hadn't mentioned it), that I love nature and the environment (8 years of girlscouts, a major in biology, and zookeeping), and that I am a woman.&nbsp; Put that all together and if you couldn't figure it out, yes I am a democrat.&nbsp; Living in IL I'm happy to see Obama could basically run away with the election because he has no opponent at current time, not to mention he seems to me to be the best man for the job, a very good speaker, a family man, and is a moderate liberal (I'm not exactly keen on the crazy psycho tree huggers that linger too far to the left).   So that all being said, I listened to Kerry's speech today.&nbsp; I thought it was a well played move in the battle for the presidency.&nbsp; He covered all his bases, and of course I liked the part about giving teachers better pay and more respect.&nbsp; Definitely up my alley.&nbsp; I think at this point Bush has his work cut out for him, and that it seems like the election is going to be another very very close race.&nbsp; But it is extremely early to tell, however, I'm pretty certain he'll have my vote.
"To see a&nbsp;world in a grain of sand, and heaven in a wild flower, to hold infinity in the palm of your hand, and eternity in an hour, " -William Blake   That quote is beautiful, and to me, though I don't profess to be a person who is great at analyzing poetry, it means that life is fragile and the littlest things contain some of the greatest mysteries and miracles the world can know.   Okay, okay, I've been watching Tomb Raider way too much, but I love that quote from it.&nbsp; I love those movies (should've put them on the list), and I love how much of a badass Angelina Jolie is as Lara Croft.&nbsp; Another heroine I admire is Wonder Woman, have since I was a little girl.&nbsp; Talk about strong and beautiful women.&nbsp; Though&nbsp;Lara is&nbsp;a bit waify in that movie,&nbsp;and Wonder Woman is a cartoon&nbsp;they give me a body and character image that&nbsp;I wouldn't mind working toward.&nbsp; Sexy, beautiful,&nbsp;smart, strong, observant, ingenious, etc.&nbsp; Okay maybe I just really like these characters way too much, dunno, but I'd take it.&nbsp; Though I know I posses&nbsp;a few of those qualities, I wouldn't mind striving for a body like either one.&nbsp; Although, I am fully aware that they are fiction, and have fictional proportions.   Thank goodness I'm almost back&nbsp;down to my p
