Mood:  Unsure  Music:  Bush - Old  Dinner with Kim was really nice. I've been tossing some ideas around in my head for a while and it was quite theraputic to get rid of them. As for the meal, I had the most DELICIOUS taco salad in  the world.   Hope everyone had a great day of classes.
Mood:  Sleepy  Music:  Wham - Wake me up before you go  I am not looking forward to tomorrow ... the school cycle begins again. Although I am looking forward to Thursday night at Farahs. Yippie!   Good luck Gary on your exam and GMAT studies ... you are going to do great! I am going to meet Kim for a bit o' Mexican for dinner. Adios!
Mood:  Pleasantly bored  Music:  Portishead - Sour Times  I helped little bro #1 move into his dorm Wednesday. Here's a recap of that hellacious day.  Awake at 6 a.m. (after being asleep for 3 total hours) to shower and pack my car up.  7 a.m. we head to his campus arrive just in time to score a free breakfast in the dining hall and we are then quickly ushered to orientation. Hour upon endless hour they talk about the most useless crap. Fun. Then they decide that it is a fantastic time of day to take the campus tour. We are in  SOUTH FLORIDA  and it is 2 p.m., which as many of you know, is  PEAK HEAT . So here we are dragging our tortured minds across this damn campus, up stairs, around the same buildings until we all have nice blisters on our feet. Now it is 5 p.m. and the dorms open up to let students move in. Oh my day just got a  world  better. Now I have to carry over-packed boxes up 2 flights of stairs *with blisters on my feet* into a urine-scented hall.  So as I walk into the hall I make a small comment, quite softly to my brother "It smells like piss in here." So this bitch orientation leader, who is at most 19, comes over and says "Well, this is a college dormitory and in college this is what we live in." RIGHT. I reply "oh really, well when I lived in my dorm 3 years ago it didn't smell like piss and it was a condemned building."  Anyhow, now I am back in town and quite relieved to have some quiet time after this past week.
Mood:  A bit too relaxed for having 2 exams  Music:  The Cars - Shake It Up  So I had 2 quizzes and 3 exams in 2 days. Not quite my idea of a jolly good time. But I got a 95 on my exam last night, I think I did well on this morning's exam and my final tonight will be a lot less stressful thanks to my 95 :)  I spoke with my mom today from India, she said her cab had to stop in the road to let a monkey cross. People milk cows in the middle of the street and pee right there in public. She went wild in the markets yesterday though, she said they have really nice things for really  really  cheap. She picked up some jewelry, a custom-made leather coat for my dad, purses, lamps, pashminas and cool beaded boxes. Whoo hoo, good deal Mom ;)  "I'm ready to get the hell home," said mom.  I'm gearing up to drink for free at Farah's tonight, so you better drag your lazy booty out and meet me!  Off to quiz #2 :) Have a delicious day!
Mood:  Happy  Music:  System of A Down - Sugar  I had a great weekend with the fam. I missed Baila kitty a lot though :(  My mom had an 18 hour flight to India. I would go out of my mind. She said it is beautiful there, at least in New Dehli where she is staying.   I am going to make an honest attempt at productivity, so have yourself wonderful day.  GOOD LUCK GARY ON YOUR ACCOUNTING EXAM! YOU ARE ONE SMART COOKIE ;)
Mood:  Smiley  Music:  STP - Wet My Bed  Kitty is napping on my lap. Why is she so adorable?  Poor thing though, today was her first vet visit. Let's just say that once she couldn't see me, all kitty hell broke loose. They'll think twice before taking her out of the room without me. Baila is quite healthy according to the vet (who then gave me a baggie of free goodies for Baila!)  Packing for the weekend is complete and I am about to get off this box and drift into a nice, calming sleep.   In case you are bored, check out some of these cool places ...

Mood:  Happy  Music:  Pre-Pop Jewel - Down So Long  Some band made a cover of Portishead's Sour Times... terrible.  Leave a good thing alone!
Mood:  Tickled Pink  Music:  Counting Crows - 'Round Here   Ode to an Ass  Once upon a time there was this girl. She was weird, a carnie, seriously.  So carnie gal has a robust bootie, aka a  urlLink badonkadonk . Carnie girl has 2 friends, yes TWO WHOLE FRIENDS...one a virgin who is kinda like her bitch, and the other a self-employed prostitute whom she dislikes.  Anyhow, carnie gal thinks that she is cool, especially becasue she reads away messages and gets her panties in a wad about them.  Well, here's to you carnie girl. Kiss your vacuum friend goodbye and wave to her in Nashville.  All my love, Pathetic.   In other news, I went to Pet Supermarket today to purchase a kitty carrier. All they had was this BRIGHT blue one, called the Cosmic Carrier with cartooned space-bound animals riding in a shuttle...helmets and all. Oh the embarrassment tomorrow at the vet. Here comes Baila in her big blue shuttle.
