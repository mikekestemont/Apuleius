"How do I flush?"
"Can we try that again without limbs?"
"Mom???"
Some friends and I have a neverending game called "Bad Things To Say After Sex".  It's pretty self-explanatory.  Here I will be posting some of these for everyone to read
Hi, and welcome to my new blog.  Here is the inevitable introduction.  My name is Matt, I'm 24 and live in Louisville, KY.  I answer to Dolamite, Celebrity, and just about anything else you choose to call me (except for whatever YOU were thinking).  I have a pet sister, a vast collection of shoes I don't wear, and now I have a blog.    That's all you get for now, goodbye.
Well, shopping went excellent.  I stuck to my schedule, got pretty much everything I was supposed to, and even had time to head to OfficeMax and get an irresistible deal from there. That deal turned out to be even better, but I won't divulge that now.   The funny thing that happened was that the computers went down while I was waiting in line at CompUSA(the computer superstore).  That was irony.  Went to the aquarium this weekend with my brother and Jim.  It was pretty cool.  I must do a new fishtank now, hehe.  Jim had a new reef tank and I am jealous I suppose.  The neat thing about a reef tank is that pretty much everything in the tank is alive.  From the coral to the tiny creatures that inhabit it.  I did have an impulse buy this weekend.  It was a mixer from Guitar Center.  I have really wanted one for a while, but it's not exactly in the time frame I was planning on buying it.  Oh well, it happens.
Well, Thanksgiving has come and gone and it's almost time to hit the stores.  I'm excited cuz it's like the first time that I have been able to go out when the stores open and I'll actually get to see all that crazy stuff that goes on.  I hope it makes me laugh.  I hope I don't get into it too much.  I hope, I hope, I hope.  I just hope I come home with some money left over and not alot off the "why did I buy that again?" items.  Oh, and I hope to find gifts for my family and not just me, although my parents depend on me to buy my own presents now.  It's much better that way.  You just go buy all the stuff you want and whatever you don't wanna wait till Christmas to open you just go ahead and open it.  Then the parents are SOL cuz they can't give me something I already opened (it's a rule or something).  Not to mention the low number of throw away gifts and "don't use that in the house" gifts you get.  There's still the can of silly string.  I can always count on getting a can of silly string for my birthday or Christmas.  No matter how many times I unload the thing on my little sister throughout the house.  Mom still always yells "go outside with that", but that never stops me and it never stops her from buying the crap either.  Perhaps I should light it on fire.  She would certainly get the message when she saw how quickly it burst into flames.  Hmmm, now there's a thought.  Anyway, it's time for a shower.  Later.
I'm back again.  An odd thing happened today:  I got a check from Home Depot whom I haven't worked for in at least 6 months.  I think it was my very very delayed last check, but I can only hope that many many more will follow, haha, yeah right.  I'm the king of wishful thinking...and what a great song also!!  Anyways, I got a Pocket PC this week.  It rocks!!  It's the Toshiba e740.  It has WiFi and voice recording which will both be very handy.  The best part is that I can keep track of my checking accout on it too.  I am very bad about not keeping track of that.  That's about the only exciting event as of late.  No new guitar yet.  I'm kinda glad I don't have one around now because when I get home from work I am incredibly dirty and would just get the thing dirty too.  Mmmkay, well that's all.  Bye.
I'm back.  I broke my computer a while ago and, well, decided to screw my faithful blog readers and not blog.  Since that fateful day I have decided that you people while not worthy of reading my thoughts will only seek other people's thought's instead of mine.  Damn, that was a conceited sentence.  Anyway, I now have a job and a love interest in my life.  Both are doing well, but one is much better, hehe.   I get to see her (Jessica) tomorrow, : ).  	I have no guitar this week, well, no guitar with strings on it.  This is my own fault, but I miss it.  Hopefully, I will have a new one soon.  I need some kind of creative output or my head will explode.  I'm looking into this one :  nice, huh?  Well, that's all.  See ya.
Happy new year!!!!  I know it's still early, but I won't be back till next year.
Haha, ya know what I just noticed.  Well, the advertising on this site changes depending on what I write about in my blog (obviously), but it now says, "Elimate All Odors ..." and "Destoy Odors Naturally  ..." and it's all because I ended my last post with "it's time to clean my dirty self up".  Went up to see the Krinj guys play this weekend.  They keep getting better and better.  Ben is working at a new venue called Radio Down.  It opens tomorrow (New Years Eve) and that's where I will be.  No date and lots of alcohol is a good New Years to me....and a wonderful New Year to you(however you prefer to celebrate)!!!
Well, Christmas was awesome.  Got everything I wanted and more.  A digital camera, a new printer, a label maker.  My brother and sister n
