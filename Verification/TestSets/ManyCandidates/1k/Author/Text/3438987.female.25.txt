I've now lived in the space between an old way of life and a new for 7 weeks.  Rather than experience change as a single instance, I took a break between the end of my old experiences and the beginning of new ones.    Leaving the old wasn't hard but I'm about to jump into the new (well, the short-term new) and it scares me.    I don't know what exactly is so scary about it-- I will be seeing familiar people in the next 2 months, staying in my country, and returning to a familiar city.  But I find myself crying for no reason, thinking at times of turning back, and almost dreading the fantastic summer I've planned.  A known quantity is always less scary than the unknown.    This is the last deep breath before the plunge.  I've done similar things before, and I know the pattern.  When I get in the car to leave DC, I will cry, maybe a lot.  Then, worn out and calm again, will resign myself to the next hours-- not excited, but doing it, doing what I had planned to do.  Slowly over those hours, the resignation will dissipate as I remember that not only did I choose to take this trip, it is what I dreamed of doing for 2 1/2 corporate years, what others keep telling me they'd love to do, and what I may never have the chance to do again.  Before being on the road becomes routine, I will enjoy the juxtaposition of grief and excitement, of leaving the old and moving towards the new.
First hour on the road :  Depending on the time of day, some degree of pop is appropriate; happy-to-be-driving (or need-to-wake-up) music.  Try U2's Pop, Flaming Lips, or (gasp) top 40 radio.   In the groove :  Calming, Zen-- you're changing lanes with ease, thinking about putting it into cruise.  Try Beck's new album, classical if you're so inclined.   OK... :  You've been driving awhile.  Well into the trail mix, you feel the need for a little energy-- angry energy.  Although you're not angry, you listen to keep from looking at every mile marker, totalling the number of hours your legs have been in a single position, or blowing up at the crazy truckers.  So many options here:  Def Lepperd, Bon Jovi, Radiohead, Eminem...truly endless.  You could drive angry for awhile  You think you're back to Zen :  and you might try something a little calmer.  But you're wrong.    Can Not Wait to get out of the car :  Nothing will do here but oldies/soul-- you've got to belt it out with Diana Ross, Marvin Gaye, or Aretha.  As you pull off the highway, you're back to happy.
I imagine it is impossible to stand out in Portland, just as it is impossible to look like everyone else.  When I pierced my eyebrow and went to work at the Corporate Executive Board, I stood out.  Here nobody would blink an eye, and I might even fit in a bit better.  There's a weird sort of homogeny to a city full of nonconformists.    Yesterday I did everything Portland-- spent a lot of time in Powell's City of Books (where they have a ceiling-to-wall shelf full of books about FDR and Eleanor Roosevelt), bought fruit from a farmer's market, sat outside with a cup of coffee to watch people, went to yoga (where I almost passed out, then walked into the men's changing room...luckily I turned around in time to avoid too much awkwardness and luckily Portlanders are pretty chill anyway), got a $1.50 haircut (which the guy who's cut my hair twice in DC will groan over...he's been "nursing my hair back to health").  That evening I did everything Hostel-- sampling the current resident cook's masterpiece, helping out with a sidewalk chalk masterpiece, and talking for hours and hours on the huge porch.  I could stay in Portland for awhile.   I really wish I had brought a tape recorder to keep record of what I'm thinking.  When I'm not driving there's too much going on to journal intensively, and I can't possibly bore you all with the waves and waves of thought about life, travel, work, the US, etc. etc. etc.  If I could just talk as I drove (when I'm thinking most anyway) I might be able to capture those thoughts (I'm always brilliant when I don't have a pen around).
I can't imagine a better shower than after 4 days of driving, hiking, and sleeping in my clothes.  I was on the road north into Oregon today and couldn't handle it any longer.  For those who have never taken a shower at a truck stop (I was one of you until today), put away your skepticism.  Clean floor, clean towels, a secure lock on the door-- and only a bit unnerving to hear the voices of truckers right outside as I showered.    I hiked the old growth forest in California yesterday-- there's something comforting about those huge moss-covered trees that seem to melt into the soft ground. I also stayed at a campground where I could watch the seals play in the ocean, then watch the sun set and turn everything pink.

I made it!  All the way from DC (where I saw the Atlantic Ocean about a month ago) to San Francisco!  What a great city-- and even more interesting than usual on Pride weekend.  I've spent a few hours wandering here, and will head north soon, making my way for the next several days along the coast of California then Oregon.    It's a pretty cool experience to be on highways across the country.  The hiking and friend-visiting along the way is actually the better part, but harder to describe (hikes in brief:  sky in shades of blue, mountains and hills, tiny alpine wildflowers and other colorful things, chipmunks, etc.  I spend much of my hiking time-- and driving, too-- gasping in wonder, or smiling with t
