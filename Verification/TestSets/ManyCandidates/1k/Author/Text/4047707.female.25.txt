i just got home and i'm sober. i know. i'm makin that face too. u'd think i'd be all drunkies since it's like 2:30 but nope. i'm sober. how pathetic huh? i went to the yacht club(that's right. workin on my salsa moves!) with some kids from work and was dancing so much that i didn't have a chance to drink. i had two drinks the whole night. it was fun tho. we danced and made fun of people like always and just chilled. nothin special, but hanging out is always cool. now i'm home and jason and alexa were too drunk to drive so i told em they could crash here. BIG mistake. I think i hear em havin sex. i didn't really feel like washing but now i have to wash the sheets and stuff. they're weirdos so i'm sure they're not jut having "normal" sex. maybe i should sleep in the living room or somewhere where i can't hear em. my room&nbsp;is too close to the guest. anway, i guess i better go to sleep. i don't have to be at work til noon but i gotta go to my mom's to pick up my mail. ok yeah so i'ma sleep in the living room. this is retarded.
I'm watchin for better of for worse right now and i dunno how these stupid people would put their wedding in the hands of other people. i dunno bout that. anyway, i went to sears today to try to get a fridge because the one i have at home is an old one my sister gave me. it's not working very well anymore tho. my ice cream looks like milk or like those frostys they sell at wendy's. so the guy was showing me fridge's and i found one. so then he starts trying to sell me a washer. i'm like, "no. i got one thanks." he's like, "well how bout a dryer?" and i said that i had one of those too. he's like, "well u really should take advantage of our no interest til 2006 sale." i was already irritated cuz of work and this retarded guy just made it worse. anyway, he kept offering me all sorts of things and i was like, "listen dude. all i need is a fridge." ugh. he's not well. needless to say he finally left me alone after 987454365 hours. after that i went home and went for a swim and now i'm watching for better or for worse. i swear. these people r dumb.
Yeah thought I'd get ur attention with my subject. Anyway, this is my first entry let alone my first online journal I've ever done but I thought it was about time. So sorry to disappoint but that's why the subject is what it is. So I wish I had some cool stuff to say but I don't. Oh wait I do have a funny story from lunch today. I was at McDonald's eating by myself like a loser cuz I took my lunch late and all of the people from work hadn't eaten in like 56 years so they left without me. I was sitting by the door and some guy in a suit walks up to me and is like "Hey what's up?" I'm like, "I'm eating. That's about it." So he was asking for my name and shit like that while I was thinking how much I wasn't enjoying my meal anymore and deciding that I was gonna take this to go and putting my food in my bag . I mean who hits on people at a McDonalds?!? Oh well anyway, I was being all short and he noticed and left be4 I got up from the table. He was walking forward with his head turned back saying bye to me and smiling like a dumbass and BAM! He went face first on the door. Apparently he didn't know it had to opened first or something. Maybe it was a "u had to be there" moment but I thought it was pretty fuckin funny. Then of course I called everyone in existence and told em bout it. Anyway, that was the highlight of my day. Other than that, got outta work, went for a swim, and went to the track like any other day. I also cleaned up a bit which I needed to do cuz it was smelling kinda funky in the living room after this weekend. Which reminds me, someone left their trunks in my dryer. They're red and black just in case someone who was here this weekend reads this and knows the owner. Well I got them. I think they're sending me to Houston this weekend at work but I'm not sure yet. I hope not. Traffic there sucks. Plus I don't really feel like getting shot either. We'll see. Ok well I'm off to bed.
so i was told that by answering those questions yesternight really helped in getting to know stuff about me. Of course not the deep stuff but just stuff that i like. i'll finish the list of questions later. i promise. Don't you wish that everyone wore a tag on them saying their pet peeves and what they're looking for when ur dating? Mine would say something like, "Sense of humor is a must, smart, modesty, and don't bother with me if ur looking for someone who's patient and doesn't have a bad temper." Whoa! I'ma get all the boys with that one huh? I was talking to a buddy of mine about that today and he said that that just takes all the fun out of going out with people. U'd never meet anyone like that. But i just don't like people to waste my time i guess. I'm not looking for anyone or anything, i just thought it was an interesting point. I was asked how many people i've loved in the past but i couldn't answer that becuz at that time i felt i did and then later on i get over it. t
