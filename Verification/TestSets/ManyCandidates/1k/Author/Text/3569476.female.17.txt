What the hell is my problem?! Okay so I leave for camp tomorrow and I'm going mental. I love camp, it's been my home away from home for going on nine years and now suddenly I don't wanna leave. And it's all because of one thing... my amazing friends.  I know camp is gonna be the same amazing experience that I have every year. The kids are gonna be awesome and the counselors are gonna be a blast but I can't help thinking how much I want my friends to be with me there. To experience the campfire and the just awesome-ness that is camp. Augh, but I know they can't and it makes me want to cry. I've never been this close to so many people before; it's frightening. I think that's why I've never be homesick before, not a little, not at all. I never really had anyone to miss before.  Now, don't get me wrong. I'm excited for camp but I've gotta face the fact that I don't know any of the JCs or CITs (hardly) and I know things about my friends that no one else does. Four weeks is a long time. It's a long time to be away from Sobe, Kay, Page and Potts, Nemo and Hanus and even Kopetsky. I'm gonna miss them all in their own little ways.  Auhhh, four weeks. How can I go without my friends for four weeks?
I just had this revelation a few minutes ago. IT REALLY IS SUMMER. I just slept for 20 hours straight and I don't have to worry about getting any homework done. It kicks ass.  Well to tell the truth I still have homework but it's for A.P. Oh yeah and the book club which is gonna be awesome. Here's the book list as I can remember it off my head:  Les Miserables- Victor Hugo  Lady Chatterley's Lover- D. H. Lawrence  The Phantom of the Opera- Gaston Leroux  The Importance of Being Earnest- Oscar Wilde  Brave New World- Aldous Huxley  1984- George Orwell  Angels and Demons, De Vinci Code- Dan Brown  The Lovely Bones- Alice Sebold  Othello, Twelfth Night, The Tempest- Shakespeare  If there are some I've forgotten or maybe you wanna join the fun leave a comment or something. Well I'm off to enjoy summer.   Buh bye.
Today was freakin' awesome. I can't even believe it happened. Well it didn't start out so good, the ACT's blew somethin' major, but right after that I coolified myself and went to watch some of the best friends I have graduate from High School. Of all of 'em I'm gonna miss my Page the most. There was a strange feeling in the air so that even when I wanted to cry, I couldn't. I guess which is for the best, but still...  Anyway, after the Ceremony it was off to Page's. I met her family. Her sister was extremely pretty and had amazing taste in shoes and her brother was so awesome. We kept trying to get him to sit with us but he turned us down each time. Oh well, he was awesome anyway. Potts, Hanus, Reithel, and Matt all made appearances and so did Brooks and Starkey. Lemme just say fun was had by all.  One finally thought for my Senior friends: "I'm gonna miss the hell outta you so you better stay in touch forever!" I love you all and I'll miss you.   For everyone else: "CLASS OF '05 KICKS ASS!!!"
These are the Good Old Days    These days nostalgia is lost on me I live for now instead of what will be Too happy to look back on yesterday I wish we could stay forever this way Such beautiful moments go by too fast Seconds, minutes and hours slip past Until all are gone; the day will end Knowing tomorrow you'll still be my friend Together up to the stars we gaze Singing, "These are the good old days"  When I'm with you I'm never judged I'm beside you when my makeups smudged My hairs in a mess and my jeans are torn Others look at me to frown and scorn But you stand by and hold my hand I can always count on you to understand But the sand keeps falling in the hour glass And what is now, too soon will pass Years will speed by, leaving us in a daze But we'll be singing, "These are the good old days"  The time of our parting draws on apace So I'll smile with you and save your place Forever if need be until you come home From wherever it is you've chosen to roam And though these tears may fall from my eyes I always knew we'd have to say our goodbyes I have no regrets though it hurts me so To look back on so long ago So one last time, under the sun's warm rays, We'll be singing, "These are the good old days"   Page, I love you! I'll miss not have you at school. Don't cry, we still have forever...
Today was a sad day for me. Yeah, I know, last day of school sorta I should be happy. Well, I'm not. This last semester kicked me in the ass and I don't know how to recover. I feel my brain shutting off for the summer and I'm like no, no, not yet!!! Plus because of slacking this semester I have to go to ALL of my exams. This sucks so much. Also it was the last day of school for the Seniors. Damn how I'm gonna miss them. It really isn't gonna be as fun next year w/o them. I'll miss you guys. MUAH!
Well, camp is over, I'm done apartment watching and Seton Fest is over and done with. NOW WHAT DO I DO?! I am so freaking bored. Maybe camp spoiled me because I was used to all this action but now I'm just bored out of my mind. Somebody call me so we can do something, ANYTHING. I guess I should look on the bright side; i
