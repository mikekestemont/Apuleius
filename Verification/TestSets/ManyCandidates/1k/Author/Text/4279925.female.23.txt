My last few days in Perth have been a bit of a rollercoaster ride. Not only had I been having some pretty horrible nights sleep, but friends kept on turning up at my door and reminding me why I really wanted to stay in Perth.  So, inbetween bouts of nervousness characterised by the feeling that a giant hand was crushing my stomach, and hyperactivity that made whoever witness them wish I was gone already, I have managed to fit in a few sobs and tears. All round a good last few days.
I just wrote my first letter to a member of the aristocracy today. It was such a strange feeling to be writing 'My Lord' instead of 'Dear blah blah'.  Right, so, once The Right Honourable the Viscount Crispin Brentford gets back to me ...
I really knew winter was here when I stepped out of the house one day and the ground was covered in frost. Sure, Australia sees frost, so the shimmering swards of grass on Hatfield Mead were not a surprise. What was a surprise however were the frosted sidewalks, which I had to negotiate so very carefully for about 500 meters. Every drop of water on a surface was frozen - I had certainly never seen frosted concrete and tar before. I haven’t seen it since either, so thankfully I have not needed ice-skates to get to the bus again. As I turn out of Hatfield Mead each morning to go to the bus, I look out across Morden Park, and on a clear day it is a sight that never fails to remind me I am in another country. The bare branched trees are many-masted ships ghosting above the mist that obscures their trunks and the grass completely veiled in silver frost. I now understand what crystal-clear air is about ... nothing else really describes the biting crispness of the atmosphere on a cloudless day, you feel as if you could see forever. Overcast days are absolutely no fun, though they are that little bit warmer. Sometimes the sun is even out (gasp!) and there is a wash of orange on the mist and red on the grass so it looks many degrees warmer than it is.   The most entertaining part of the morning for me is my blissful ‘Puff the Magic Dragon' moments. Whenever Perth was cold enough for your breath to steam I would act like a child and pant and huff as much as possible to get a tiny wisp of steam. So naturally, each morning as I mope out the door into the cutting wind and biting air, the only thing that cheers me up is a good, long exhalation so I can stride out in my own personal cloud of steam - guaranteed to brighten anyone’s morning. The only sight that cheers me up more than watching a column of steam rising up from a well peopled bus stop, is the sight of the morning runners, bundled up like eskimos and trailing steam like the Hogwarts Express.
The weather forecast for the last week was snow, but frankly I was getting AWFULLY tired of waiting. On Tuesday I was walking down the street to lunch when itsy bitsy little snow flakes starting swirling around me like tiny lost baby hailstones. This lasted for about 30 seconds. Wednesday I entertained a few workmates by standing on the roof and doing a Julie-Andrews-in-the-first-scene-of-the-Sound-of-Music style dance in the 1 minute splatter of snow. Once again, not terribly exciting, but certainly an escalation.  Then, Wednesday afternoon I went up to Old Street to see my house and as I came out of the tube it was snowing. Old Street Station has an open roof to the sky and so I saw the snow falling before I saw it on the ground. Being a snow-virgin there were a few fabulous moments when I didn’t even know it was snow, I seriously looked at the sky and thought ‘that is REALLY fat rain!’ (thank you Terry Pratchett) Walking out onto my very first stretch of snow covered ground I then discovered that the soles on my boots are entirely useless on snow, that a beanie doesn’t protect you from snow in your eyes and that no-one else was grinning quite as broadly as I was at the snow. Once again I should have taken notice.  It was about 20 minutes before rush hour when I got out of the Tube and so, for a short and blissful time, the snow was undisturbed and blanketed the usual London noise until I could almost hear myself jumping around in my head singing ‘It’s snowing it’s snowing hahahaha it sticks to everything my coat is white ah slippery hehehehe it’s snowing it’s snowing it stings when it hits my face I’m not even cold yet it’s snowing it’s snowing whoops.’ The streets were quiet and those who were about were either standing sulkily wishing they had better shoes on or were under 19 years old and had a snowball in either hand.  I headed out to Leytonstone to have a snowball fight with Monica and Matt. The snow was MUCH thicker out in the parks near them and we had a running fight in the street and then ran crazily around in the pristine snow of the parks. It was Matt’s first experience of snow too so the three of us cleared the roof of every car in the street to make arsenals of snowballs and then, once in the parks, made snow angels and found endless amusement in trying to slam each other down in the snow. While Monica and Matt frolicked I was finding new, untouched snow to make footprints in and beaming indiscriminately at snow laden trees feeling too excited to do anything but say ‘this is so cool.’ The best way to describe the feeling was like I had stepped into a film - I knew exactly what snow looked like, but not what it felt like – it was familiar and unfamiliar at the same time.
