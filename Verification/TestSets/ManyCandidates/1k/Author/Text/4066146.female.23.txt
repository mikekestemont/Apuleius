Go ahead and call me lazy, but I decided to not go to work today. In light of all the turmoil with Jack(ass) I opted to take advantage of a bright sunny day and just relax. Besides, I have to pack and get ready for the super fun weekend that lies ahead. Anyway, all feeble justifications aside, I'm glad I didn't go in. I hate that place and can not WAIT to punch out for the last time.   Harry and I went out to the new boat last night - or rather TRIED to go out to the new boat last night. We loaded up the Achilles inflatable dinghy and the stupid little motor in the back of the truck since the launch service at Pine Island (as I learned a few weeks ago - while radioing in at approximately 6:30 from my friend's mooring - doh! Thank god for boater camaraderie!) shuts down at 5pm. Well, when I looked at the inflatable, which must be at least 12 years old, I thought Harry had the floorboards in the bottom of the truck. We get over to Pine Island and it turns out Harry thought it was perfectly ok for the two of us to taxi out in an inflatable with no floor! In other words, the only thing supporting both our weight and the weight of the motor mount and motor itself was a thin layer of Hypalon fabric - OLD hypalon fabric. It took me a while to assure Harry that I really do know what I'm talking about and unless he wants to go for a swim, I'd wait until we can bring over the hard-bottom inflatable or can find some spare floor boards for this inflatable dinghy.   Anyway, it was nice to take a trip over to the marina regardless of being land-bound. Since things have slowed down I haven't been on the water in about a week and just being near it made for a relaxing and peaceful night. Plus I got to spend some time with Harry without my mom around - which is always fun. I know next year when I'm on the job market I'll have the opportunity to relocate - and most likely a lot of the positions will be inland. My ideal location would be either own a farm in the middle of nowhere - like in Colorado or Idaho - or to live right on the water, preferably in New England somewhere. Since the likelihood of finding a successful farm/ranch to own is very slim, I think I should set my sights on staying near the ocean. No matter how frequent or sporadic my visits to the shore are, every time is like returning to someplace - (cheesy, I know) mystical and new. I never get tired of the smell of the air, the way my hair feels after being ravaged by salty winds, the weightiness of my body upon returning to shore, the clang of brass bells in the distance or the cackle of seagulls overhead. Sam was telling me that there are a lot of positions open every year out in California, which sounds like an interesting change, but it's not exactly the New England I've grown to love over the years. Pete even said he would like to live in California (which is not to say I would base my decision solely on his willingness to come with me). There's a myriad of reasons to leave, there's a myriad of reasons to stay. Like always, I'm getting ahead of myself and just have to sit back and accept that there's no way to prepare for that type of decision until I'm actually faced with it.   So rather than spend more time in front of the computer when I don't have to, I think I will look up directions for our adventure this weekend, clean up around the house, workout, grab a good book, and head outside. All remnants of my tan have worn off in the past couple weeks, so I think a little natural vitamin D will do me good.   -C
I have&nbsp;a nasty hangnail on my right index finger that - despite my best attempts -&nbsp;will not go away. It's not such a big deal really, but I kept getting it caught on things at work today so I decided to cover the sucker up when I got home.   Yes,&nbsp;here is my "blog" - what a dumb word. A lot of my friends have started to write them, and I think it's a relatively neat concept. Since I spend a lot of time at the computer as is, I thought perhaps having a computerized journal would be a better option seeing as I haven't written anything in my "real" journal since March. What can I say, I'm a follower...   Speaking of frrriiieennndds...   Roxann is leaving for VA in three weeks! BAH! What am I going to do? I'm going to miss Roxann so much I can't even begin to prepare myself.   Ok - I&nbsp;just ripped off the band-aid. I'll put one back on before I go on the elliptical.   Anyway, Roxann is one of my favorite people in the world. I never thought I'd get along so well with someone so different than me, but she truly is an amazing person. Aside from just being completely hysterical and fun, I really admire her strength and honesty. Roxann has taught me in the 2 years I've known her how to relax and just screw up; not that I'm advocating "screwing up" - but she made it ok to just be a goofball, to think "nasty" things about others (and to express that), to justify spending half the day in my pajamas with a good book or bad daytime tv now and then, or to eat the&nbsp;friggin calzone - and enjoy it god damn it! Bottom line: my phone bill is sure to&nbsp;be out of control come September.   Speaking of September - ughhh. Back tooo schoooll.&nbsp;Part of me is really excited, the other part is just ready t
