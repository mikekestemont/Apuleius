,.:'`':., 7/2/04 ,.:'`':., º*~ Mood: HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY!!!!! ~*º  today was sooooo awesome!!! well i got up at like 7:00 (BLEH!!) but we got eric from his house at like 8:30 and we were both about to fall asleep... an hour and a half car drive, and we were there. right away he thought the place was weird, but after a tour he really started to like it. we went back into the house after my parents left to do their thing and we found the comfiest bed in the house (conveniently located in the back room) and.. well... if ur intelligent enough, what do u think happened? lol figure it out urself. aaaaanyways, yeah then we went to get dairy queen and i think the guy there thought we were brother and sister (nothing new actually) until we kissed and then he was kinda like HELLLLLLL-OOOOOOOOO lol. yeah... we came back to the house and stuff (there's sum other stuff we did but it'd make this post waaaaaay too long so ill only put in the major details) and a few hours later we went up into the fort (a lil wooden kinda box thing on stilts with a roof) and watched the sunset while cuddling... my mom walked by and was like "how cute, wish i had a camera" and so did my dad. i wish we had a scanner so i could put up the sunset pictures we got... sooo beautiful. we were jus in the fort (did i mention i was in his jacket =) ) and then it got dark and we watched what few stars there were (there's usually thousands that u can see up there, but my parents made us leave early.. bleh) so yeah, we left at like 9 and stopped at mcdonald's for lunch. i fell asleep in his arms and woke up in time to see the full moon rising over the mountains before falling back asleep in his lap. *sigh* so all in all, an AWESOME day.  :: I LOVE ERIC!!! :: :: woohoo go power rangers ::
,.:'`':., 7/1/04 ,.:'`':.,  º*~ Mood: Tired and EXCITED!!!! ~*º   wooo second post... and a day kinda like yesterday. -_____- ; yeah, i got up at 10 for volleyball as usual (WHY CAN'T I SLEEP IN?!?!?!) and yeah that was fun.. ran to tall mouse with my mom afterwards (bleh... but kinda cool) and went over to my friend shelby's house. we met at the highschool we're going to (ESPERANZA!!!! WOOO GO AZTECS!!!!) to watch her younger brother and his friend, younger sister and her friend, play soccer. and of course right in the middle of them playing the sprinklers come on... great. so i got dragged into the water wearing a WHITE SHIRT and jeans. doesn't that sound fun? yeah then we came back to my house and watched peter pan and drooled over jeremy sumpter. we're such losers, we were all cracking up laughing at the fact that jeremy put too much emphasis on the words "dark castle" and when he said that the singing voices came on and we were playing it over and over and over... then when he calls captain hook a codfish it sounds all demented... yeah we're losers, get over it. so yeah, all in all a pretty good day. was gonna go to the movies with eric, but whatever... ill be seeing enough of him this weekend. =) well i could spend every waking moment with him, but yeah. just incase u didn't read my last post, we're going up the desert all day tomorrow and on saturday we're helping out at my karate dojo's booths at a parade they're having... so yeah, a fun weekend. (u probably figured this, but im not gonna be posting tomorrow, but maybe on saturday) so yeah, since im about to fall asleep, ill call it an end.   :: I LOVE ERIC!!!!! ::  :: woo go power rangers ::
