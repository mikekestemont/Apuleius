Hey Thomas - we missed you...we had an interesting discussion on the atomic bomb...the pushing of sugar is very interesting...comparable to the big companies making money off adolescents at Skyview - disguised as Vending Machines and Food Products....  Mr. Ray wants to be invited to our US History Blog - and I have the list of sixth period students.
Just some interesting things to note from Henretta about WWII Rationing:  "People found it especially hard to cut back on sugar.....the manufacturers of products such as Coca-Cola and Wrigley's chewing gum received unlimited quantities fo sugar by convincing the government tha their products helped the morale of the men and women in the armed forces". Woooooooo we are really really a nation addicted to sugar.  But what's more interesting: "Congress imposed a nationwide speed limit of 35 miles per hour...as a result, highway death rates dropped dramatically." WOW!!!!! Speed limit NATIONWIDE at 35 mph.......Man in today's lightning pace stressful lives......Such a speed limit would certainly kill off lots of people!!!!!!!!!!
Unfortunately, Ms.Clark, I will be gone all day tomorrow (for MUN) and on Friday (for NWSE), and both days are apparently discussion days. But hopefully you or some other students can post interesting discussion topics here to keep me and others who will be absent informed.   I do believe that there are lessons to be learned in history so to avoid similar conflicts, patterns, and cycles of violences (otherwise there is no point in enthusiastically studying history). Things do occur in similar way just because of natural ways of human interactions, reactions, and emotions.   And that the dropping of the atomic bomb poses an interesting question and potential debate. I personally don't have a strong opinion of that right now simply because it's such a complex issue.   Oh yeah, and don't forget to invite all the talkative sixth period students to this discussion blog!
Hey - very interesting tidbits...Thomas thank you for starting the AP Blog - American foreign policy is very complex - I wonder what would have happened if American intervened in the Spanish American War - would World War II erupted earlier - would Hitler's Final Solution been avoided or defeated before the horrible consequences.  It is so easy to make or critique our past and qualify it as a mistake.  I have never really understood the quote..."we must remember our past so we aren't condemned to repeat it ."  We will never be able to repeat the past...it is so different...however we continue to behave as humans do? How can we repeat something that is so different - or do we repeat the same instances with superior technology.     "Under God" - did you know they added that phrase in the 50s during the cold war?  America's rally around Freedom...Goodness and Godliness...Cold War propaganda?   I enjoyed reading your blogs - What are your thoughts on America's decision to drop the bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki?    Prediction: On the fifty year anniversary of Brown vs. Board of Education (1954) - Portland will host a major racial riot....Topic "TALK"  See you tommorow
We need to do something to liven this place up a bit. We should advertise more or do something...
Isn't it a sad state that the Fascist National forces won the Spanish Civil War? The Loyalists, being the Republican-elected govt., get supported by only Mexico and the USSR, while the US, Britain, and France keep their sympathies at home. I applaud those who went over to aid the Loyalists. I have yet to read much lit on this period (Hemingway's "For Whom the Bell Tolls" is now on my shelf, unread, but certainly on deck). George Orwell's "Homage to Catalonia" would be good too. I read a short, interesting excerpt from it where Orwell described himself meeting an Italian peasant. A communist soldier, a simple man, and one fighting against the government of his country to fight for his beliefs. It was interesting to consider that even some Germans and Italians, whose governments were supporting Franco's Nationalist rebellion, were joining the Loyalists to fight the spread of Fascism. It's like the Domino Effect theory in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War, but also like the end of that conflict, the "villanous" form of govt. fought against (Communist) didn't spread beyond far beyond Vietnam. Anywho, and the lack of help from democracies causes the Republican collapse, and Franco's brutal reign goes from 1939-1975; 36 years! Gee, and the policies of neutrality and appeasement certainly didn't help in Spain, or in Czechoslovakia for that matter. Or in Poland, etc. "It just goes on and on and on."    Does anyone need an extra id partner. I'm trying to get an exchange going for this new test. Anywho, see you all later, hopefully. I'd like to see what you think on this above blurb. Didn't the quote before signing into this thing say "for people who have lots to say"? Goodbye all. Adios and God bless you.                                                             Yeehawman,                                                               (Tristan)
Nicely written, Thomas. I don't understand why some people find that they must make a big stink about a two word phrase. If they don't want to say it, then they shouldn't say it. That's why the first amendment is there. It protects freedom of speech, and the freedom of not-speech. So if you don't want to say something, you're welcome to not say it. Don't start suing people because you don't want your kid to say it. I agree that little kids should know about the pledge, but forcing them to say something they don't know the meaning to is not right. If you want people to say the pledge, at least have the decency to teach them what it means first.
To deviate only a little away from wars and genocide,  urlLink Mr.Wargo's class blog has got up there the really controversial debate of the constitutionality of the Pledge of Allegiance, and especially the "Under God" phrase.  And don't blame me for spilling over that debate to this blog, but it is inevitable. Of course everyone knows that the 1st Amendments guarantees "Congress shall make no law respecting a
