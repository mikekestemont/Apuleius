It’s recently dawned on me that the self injury forums I used to go to, really fucking suck.  I made the mistake, AGAIN, to go back and make a post saying I’m still here in one piece.  So, being an idiot, after I post me little shit on myself recently, I look around at other posts.  Well, to say the least, everyone kisses the Admin., Gabrielle’s ass.  It doesn’t matter what she posts about, its right.  Every god damn post by Gabrielle gets mass appraised, like she’s is all all-knower, everything she says is right, doesn’t matter what she says, its right, she could say she hates Jews, black people and fags and people would all go, "yes gabs you are so right, thanks for pointing that out to everyone since its only right when you say it, let me kiss your ass until my lips become chapped”.  If you don’t believe me, check out this link: http://gabrielle.self-injury.net/index.php?s=8e07ac6b6e7b0dd4c2818efa5361c7cb&  I swear, that’s seriously how it goes around there.  There’s also all these posts by emo kids who are all the following:  xXx3M0grrlxXx replies: yes gabs I love you and I want to sex you so I can become a moderator, I'll whine to you when some one calls me an emo kid because all I do is write poetry and lyrics with my friends, oh wait, I have no friends, I hate it when people call me emo. *MAY MOTHER FUCKING TRIGGER YOU FUCKERS*  No lie, that is straight up from the place, I could never imitate the level or quality of which the content of the users is there, I love myself.  All I gotta’ do now is get my accomplice to email me, so we can start fucking the place up again, like how I got banned from the whole artwork/creativity section.  Maybe this time, I can get banned from the whole mother-fucking site!!  To verify this, I have nothing against the admin, Gabrielle.  It’s just all her little, minions, that piss me off the most.  All her little minions who run around her like she’s Jesus himself with the winning lottery ticket from 11-billion dollars.  Changing subjects now, I recently released a tutorial on photo *ENHANCMENT*, on my deviantart page.  So far, it’s gotten like, 150 views in the first 24 hours, I’m rather proud of that.  Now, like every thirty minutes, I get like, one more view, so every ten minutes some one look at it and learns.  Hopefully they learn, anyway.  Well its best I go to bed, I gotta get some good picture taking in tomorrow, so I better be well rested.  I’ll link up the photos I take here, maybe, or just gave you the link to my deviantart page again.  I’m outizzle.
Well, he didn’t come over today, which kinda’ surprised me, or he did come over and I didn’t hear him.  Only he knows really.  All I did today was play Final Fantasy Tactics Advance and make a tutorial on photo editing.  You can check it out at http://www.deviantart.com/view/8390435/ , since I don’t exactly know how to post real links yet.  Y’all are going to have to wait for that part, since I’m not up to date on all the coding shit that all you people seem to know.    !Warning, some fucking emo shit is coming up read at your own risk!  Ding dong, here comes the shit mobile, and you know what it’s got packin’ today?  A barrel full of loneliness!  God I felt horrible today.  All day I had Spencer on my mind, and you know who is now?  Mother-fucking Nikki is all in my head now.  Jesus after watching Bad Santa and that girl looking and sounding just like Nikki, made me think of her like mad.  She’s still on my mind to this second, which, kinda pisses me off, since I swore to myself that I’d never think of her like this again.  I couldn’t go out with her again since after all this shit that’s happened, god I don’t know what to think anymore.  I know Nikki’s going to read this since I showed her the link today, I know she’ll bookmark it or something and check it tomorrow, I just know that’ll happen.  Apparently she likes my cousin, Sam, too, which is kinda; weird since they’ve never met.  Nikki IS moving to Edmonton or somewhere around there in august, just about the time I’ll be there too.  Oh joy, I know my conscience won’t let me go there without seeing her once, I’d feel bad if I didn’t.  The only good thing that came out of that girl from the movie reminding me of Nikki was that it looked like she made mighty-fine sex.  Maybe that’s a sign?  Hah, I doubt it anyway.  Nikki’s as cold and frigid as a popsicle.    It was sunny out today, but too windy for any chance to get a good picture in.  Some cool looking clouds did roll in though, but all these god-damn houses and living at the bottom of a hill really makes it hard to get a good shot in.  Hopefully tomorrow it’ll be mother-fucking hot with no wind so I could go to Government House or Butchart, like I said in my last two fucking posts.    I’m out.
Wow, second post, I’m on fire.    I had Colin come over today; we ate chicken fingers and watched the Ali G Show on showcase.  That’s one of the funniest things I’ve ever seen in my life.  Just search for it, “Da Ali G Show”, and you’ll know why it’s so great.    After that, I played a bit of Burnout 2, while he played Diablo 2.  All of a sudden, BAM, Lee’s over again.  I swear that kid has come over everyday for who knows how long now.  He moved here from South Africa about a month ago, and apparently we’ve become best-buddies now.  He talks a lot, I’ve noticed, and I know he’s going to be coming over tomorrow, I just know it.  He’ll also come over the day after t
