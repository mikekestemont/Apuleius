June 6th, we're going to be working on the instrumental tracks to Organic B, and Organic C.  For those who don't know, these are part of the "unkept:organic" series of acoustic worship recordings for simple or house church worship use.  Organic "A" has been a great success and we're excited about taking the quality up a level and recording some newer original songs that haven't yet been put on tape.   To go with the concept, Peter Schrock (our graphic designer/photographer at Unkept) came up with the idea of having an artful photograph of an organic fruit or vegetable on the cover of each project.  Instead of #1, #2, #3 albums - we have "A", "B", "C" and so on.  Organic "A" is known as the Apple album for its wonderfully  captured green apple.  (to view:  http://www.unkeptrecords.com/store.html/)  The fruit for unkept:organic "B" is still up for grabs, but some options are the "Banana" album, "Berry" album, or "Beet" album.  Despite the way some evil people might twist Banana into some sort of offensive phalic reference, I DO like the possiblity of this fruit  being on the cover.  Towards that end, I've begun to compose a new song that could serve as the title track and bring more cohesion to the theme.  Admittedly, it needs some work but I thought I'd share it with you.  I'm open to comments and constructive feedback.  Remember though, this is an artist putting himself out there - I'm naked, and vulnerable.  Please be honest yet kind.  Thanks!  HOLY BANANA verse1 "Oh Lord, make my life long  Like a banana from Mexico May my pages yellow as I grow old in your Light Make my life "a peeling" to others I don't want to slip on the discarded skin of the evil one I want to be a fruit for You" (I'm not sure about this line)  chorus "We are Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy Whole big bunch of bananas Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy Big, big bunch of bananas"  Thoughts???

You know, somedays you just wake up sad.  I'm not talking about tears in the eyes and hyperventilation.  I mean a low-level, underlying, subtle sadness that colors the rest of one's thoughts.  So subtle, in fact, that it takes some real attentiveness to the soul to detect it.  Though I can think of at least one particular thing to which it may be related, it may be the culmination of personal and non-personal information that combine to create a sort of heavy feeling.  I have a friend (a couple actually) that say they are deeply empathetic to the feelings of those with whom they are in contact.  One friend mentioned that it can be burdensome, literally.  To resonate with the pain of others, though technically catagorized as a "gift", more often resembles a "curse".  I don't know if I have this "gift".  But, today I do.
Natalie says I'm a nerd.  I, on the other hand, am rather impressed by the fact that I'm attempting to enhance my personal knowledge and abilities in the area of computer hoo ha.  She and I are switching Macs because the one she bought for her previous job is currently sitting at home not being used except for occasional coffee shop web surfing.  This means I'm "zeroing out" her Mac and reloading the appropriate software to maximize its performance and personalize it to my uses.  I'm doing the same for the smaller laptop for her.  I take a strange joy in this computer reorganization.  It's sort of like have a messy desk, not just the desktop, but also the drawers; papers out of place, stacks on unneeded materials, and basic disorganization.  Though it is time consuming, it appeals to my deep inner desire to have things in there place.  Typically, my personality comes across - I'm told - as one who doesn't care too much about those kinds of things.  I am very adaptable and willing to live with things in disorder for quite sometime.  Ultimately, what I've come to realize is that it is really just a lot of patience for disorder with the hope in the potential of future organization.  Perhaps this is too much personal analysis but I have to explain it to her somehow.  If she understands, maybe I can sit on my couch reading my new VQS book on HTML and CSS programming without too many deprecating names being tossed my way.  ;-)
During intermission, Greg asked me what I thought of the music.    Well, I am a Mozart fan, but probably not as much of a fan as I am of some of the Romantic period composers like Brahms or Chopin.  Though Mozart's music is complex in melody, harmony, and rhythm, it can sometimes become boring and seem pedantic after hearing large portions of it in one sitting.  I'm probably the pedantic one, nevertheless, I've been seeking more specific reasons for my vague "boredom" with Mozart when taken in, hours at a time.  I've determined that for me, it comes down to harmony and melodic endings.  Though Mozart's music often has complex harmonic shifts sometimes coming at unexpected times, his melodies hardly ever fail to land back on the "root" or "one" of the diatonic scale.  In case you are not familiar with these musical terms, what I am talking about can be illustrated by humming a tune we all know, "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star".  Though this melody was written by Beethoven it does the same thing that much of Mozart music does melodically.    Hum the tune, noticing the starting note - the "Twink..." note, if you will.  This is the "root" note or "one" of the major scale from which this melody is written.  After singing the entire song, we return back to the same note on the last word, "are."  Some may say this melodic turn sounds comfortable and resolved, however others (myself included) might feel that it can sound trite, too final, or simplistic.  I am in no way trying to belittle the amazing musical gifts of either of these c
