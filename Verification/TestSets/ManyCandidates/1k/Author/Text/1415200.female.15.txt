I have learned never to expect anything from people. They always dissapoint. Especially, I never expect anything from myself. I never accomplish when there is stress. I hate people who have expactations for me, they want so much, from so little. I'm not much of an amount for anything. I can't even accomplish the task of finding myself, let alone any thing else. Everytime I put expactations into someone I am always more than let down. People have never fulfilled anything and I dont think they ever will, when ever I think I might have found that something in that person, and I am hoping that they can live up to me, they let me down. I think they have done that so much, I can't cry anymore. I am used to the fact that people dont care enough to let me feel ok that they have let me down, they just use me and that's it. I think I have only found one person that hasnt let me down yet, and I havent talked to him enough to really see what would happen. I cant seem to find myself. I better go. Pressure calls.
Today was the first day of marching band. It was, to say the least, ok..I wish I could have slept in more, but we all cant have what we want. I need to talk to *mention random name here* I've been thinking about something...need to talk to him.. but, non the less im getting back into the swing off stuff, so I can ease back into the school year. Although it will be weird since it's the high school and all. But I'll just hang out with some people, maybe get a boi, and have fun this year. I haventha fun in such a long time. It i'll be nice to let my hair down, (both figurativly and literally). I have my friends, and Im gonna stick to them. I dont care what anybody says. They have no more the authority over me than I have over them i dont really much care if there older than me, because I just dont care. I have a solid group, and thats all I need. There supportive of me. Im gonna go. It's getting late. I'll write tomarrow.
A side note: I need a episode of Brendan Leonard.
This summer has been truley boring. I have been completley anti-social..and I think that I need that. I dont need people interfereing with there problems I have enough of my own. Then again..Since I havent really talked to anyone this summer, I have absolulty no clue what is going on in the "social realm" nor do I care.  Marching band starts up again in 8 short days. Which will completley throw off my sleeping sense. I will have to get up at 8:00 in teh morning, and right now I am only getting up around 11:00 in the morning, and not going to bed until atleast 2:30-3:30 in the morning. I'm goingto be a complete wreck the first few days.  I havent came to any new conclusions recently. I havent anything to conclude. I have been completly honest with myself all this summer, and I have found what I was looking for. For once I have accomplished what I set for myslelf..even with time to spare. I hope everyone else has too.. because I know what it's like if you dont.  I really dont want to go into the high school..It seems like such a big step. Plus, I have gotten so used to going to the middle school that I really dont want to leave. But I guess it's a change I have to make, although its one I dont want to come to a conclusion about but I guess i have to. Dont worry.. I'll write later.
I realized something while I was reading over my post's..I actually depend on people. While I was upset with *insert unmentioned person here*, for stupid reasons now that I look back on it..I was truley afraid, that if I lost our friendship, then who would that  leave me to tell all my problems to, and to give me a hug when I need it. Nobody else really acts like that towards me. I mean yeah, i have a few other friends..but they would judge me. I guess he's just one of the people I need in my life. I was shocked when i thought about it..I thought i was this "Miss Independant" (no pun intended) but I really am not. Im glad I realized it though, because maybe now I wont take the best thins in life for granted anymore.   I really need another episode of Brendan Leonard. . .  Well. I better get outa here..Oh, yeah..i changed my name to rotang because it sounds so much cooler..someone save me*
"I will not die for your government or saffer religion, I choose life" - Brandon Boyd  I hate the fact people try to force your beliefs on you. The whole time as a child and a teenager, your supposed to be finding your self, but what if you can't even see who you are. All my child hood I was never forced into religion by my parents, we never attended church and I had never saw a bible. My grandparents on the other hand, sent me a bible in the mail for me to read. I thought it was a pretty good story. That's all it was to me was a story. Then I was shunned from the people at school, because in 5th grade, the only thing you really know about your self is what you belive in. All I knew was that I had nothing to believe. In 7th grade, I had made a choice to myself that i would study diffrent types of religion, to make sure I was affirmend in my agnostic ways. At the same time there was need of participants in the local youth org. i went for 7 or 8 months. Comming to the soild conclusion I am a
