100 Things About Me . . .    Inspired by the blogs I've been reading lately:  1.  I have my very first brand new car (a 2003 blue Honda Civic coupe). . . duh! =)  2.  I wish I had more doodads at home . . . a digital camera would be cool!  3.  I have 2 black cats, Tigger and Jazz.  Tigger is a snob, Jazz is a pig.  But I love them both.  4.  I have 3 younger brothers, and we're all almost exactly 2 years apart.  Who says the rhythm method doesn't work? =)  5.  I enjoy my job as a petroleum technologist.  6.  I wish I could have the best of both worlds, and get paid for learning instead of the other way around.  7.  I once had a hamster named Webster.  He died of asthma, or at least died wheezing.  8.  I once had a hamster named Fluffy.  She died of a tumor.  Hamsters aren't very good pets. =(  9.  I lived on West Timor Island, Indonesia for 8 months when I was 15 (with my family, of course).  10.  I was in French immersion until grade 7.  11.  I was incredibly shy as a child, and still am with strangers.  12.  I never had an imaginary friend.  13.  I wanted to be a vet when I was younger.  14.  I also wanted to be an astronaut . . .   15.  I wanted to be a geneticist when I was in high school.  OK, that's a 100-list in itself . . . =)  16.  I hate wearing glasses, and wear contacts unless I absolutely physically cannot (like this week).  17.  My parents are divorced, and one is remarried.  18.  I never want to get divorced.  19.  I was engaged shortly before 20, unengaged shortly after 21.  20.  I love sleeping in.  21.  Summer is my favorite season, and I hate having to work through it.  22.  I hated being unemployed this past summer (go figure *L*).  23.  I hate waiting.  24.  I have all 10 fingers and toes.  25.  If my mum gets remarried to someone with a last name that starts with a C, her initials will be ABC.  26.  I love to swim.  27.  If I have children, they'll learn to swim before they walk.  28.  I set several provincial swimming records when I was younger.  29.  Most have been broken by now.  What the hell do they feed kids these days?!  30.  I have strawberry blonde hair, and always wish it was redder.  31.  My grandpa always compliments my hair.  I love my grandpa. =)  32.  I love sincere compliments that come out of the blue.  33.  I once had a cruch on Jonathan Brandis when I was in junior high.  34.  I am convinced that I had an online fling with Ethan Embry, though some part of me will always wonder if it really was him, or some sap with too much time on his hands.  35.  I used to be a net addict.  36.  I'm not a cyber-virgin, but it's not something I'd do again.  It's actually kind of sad.  37.  I prefer the real thing. =)  38.  I would eventually like to be a member of the Mile High club.  Just to say I did it.  39.  I like my coffee from Tim Hortons, with 2 cream and one sugar.  40.  I usually add another sugar cube when I get to work.  41.  I once ran away from home.  I honestly thought it would be one less thing for my parents to worry about if I wasn't around.  I think I was 13 or 14.  42.  My father doesn't talk to me anymore (unrelated to 41, as far as I know).  43.  I have moved 6 times since I was 18, and am about to move twice more in the next couple of months.  44.  I don't like moving.  45.  I find routines reassuring and stifling all at once. =)  46.  I don't fix into a box (figuratively . . . I could, literally, if it was big enough).  47.  I like to know the big picture before I'm told details or individual steps.  48.  I think Sean Connery was and will always be the best James Bond.  49.  I think Vin Diesel is pretty awesome eye candy.  50.  My hair almost reached my butt when I was 8 years old.  51.  I sometimes miss how my mum used to brush my hair and play with it when I was young.  52.  Sometimes I'm glad I never had a sister.  53.  Sometimes I'm sad that I never had a sister.  54.  I know that "baca" means both "read" and "boyfriend" in Indonesian.  55.  I love filtered/bottled water.  Tap water tastes funny.  56.  I still eat KD.  57.  I still eat PB&J sandwiches from time to time (today, actually!)  58.  I am not terribly good at keeping friends.  There are many from my childhood that I wish I had kept in touch with.  59.  My very first boyfriend's name was Peter.  We grossed everyone out by holding hands on the school bus.  I was in grade 3.  60.  I never kissed a boy until the summer after I graduated high school.  61.  I was no longer a virgin less than a year later.  62.  I can count on one hand the number of men I've "been with".  Just so you don't get the wrong impression. =)  63.  I try not to judge people by their covers.  64.  I would be lost without post-it notes . . . the saying "You'd forget your head at home in the morning if it wasn't attached" is quite accurate with me.  65.  My parents always said "buggy" instead of shopping cart.  So do I.  People think I'm weird.  I think it's different.  And different is good.  66.  I don't call it a boot (trunk), lift (elevator), or trousers (pants) . . . but I love Bristol-speak.  67.  I have cool cousins over in England, but I've only met 2 of them (and an aunt and u
