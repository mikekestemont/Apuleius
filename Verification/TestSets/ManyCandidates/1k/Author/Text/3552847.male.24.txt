So the us govt returned sovereignty to iraq today, two days earlier than expected.  first off i want to say that, everything else aside for a moment, that this was a very good idea.  with everything going so crazy in iraq lately no one expected the us to hand over anything to iraq early.  i know a lot of people are going to say that this is largely a symbolic gesture which means very little to the progress of iraq.  i want to disagree with some of that.  i think grand symbols are what are necessary right now.  transfer of sovereignty is a grand symbol.  people can understand these things.  when they see that bremer has left iraq they start to take deadlines that we impose seriously.  we need to be taken more seriously in iraq.  the sooner the iraqis realize that the americans will leave eventually and they will have to own up for their own actions the better this whole situation will become.  iraqis have to get used to the idea of fighting other iraqis right now or else there is going to be trouble.  the sooner we stop fighting for them the better.  now, i didn't agree with the iraq war but the iraqis have to start getting there shit together.  we need an iraqi police force and army that is willing to kill iraqi insurgants if need be.  you cant be bitching that your electricity doesn't work when you wont tell the us soldiers where the people who blew up the reactor are hiding.  i am of the few in my circle who think this iraq thing can work out if smart people on both sides are used to implement the necessary planning.  if you think a democracy can be made out a dictatorship in a year and a half then you need to stop watching mtv becasue it is affecting your patience.  those who think islam is incompatible with a democratic government dont know what they are talking about and need to read a book, preferably more than one.  a strong religious component can be mixed with democracy as seen in israel, turkey, and even here in the us.  all of us non-believers need to recognized that we are a small minority.  in a recent poll 59% of those surveyed claimed that religion plays an important part in their life.  we live in a democracy and therefore we have to let them voe to.  but back to islam.  jews and christians used to live under the sultan with the same rights as muslims.  just because we are witnessing a time where there is increased hatred for westerners doesnt mean that it will last.  the muslim world is far from unanimous in its rejection of the west.  there are still many people, in some regions even a majority of muslims with whom we share certain basic cultural and moral, social and political beliefs with.  there is a significant western presence-cultural, economic,diplomatic- in the middle east.  we even have allies over there.  so what was i talking about...i dont know.  oh yeah.  i think that iraq could become a democracy given time, care, and a lot of money.  now that we are there we have to make it work.  we are already seeing the after affects of looking like idiots over there by not being able to convince even nato to help us out.  the modern world now has a vested interest in seeing iraq survive into a fledegling democracy.  everyone needs to stop pointing fingers and help out.  this is why i am voting for kerry as i think he can unite us with our old friends who wont even talk to bush becuase they are having fun saying, i told you so!  you tell em france.  this coming from a nation that is a year away from banning imigration totally and maybe kicking muslims out of their country if the crazies prevail.  they need to realize that muslims are to them what mexicans are to us....cheap labor and nannies!  haha just kidding.  they are a growing minority that likes to reproduce so whitey better watch out because the math doesn't add up in your favor.  anyway this is a ramble and i am tired of typing so i will put up more some other time.  please comment as i enjoy discussion and different viewpoints.  thanks.   p.s.  what is britney thinking getting engaged to a guy who has a kid and another on the way with h
