Went for dinner wif hui n fan.. lots of crap frm the three of us.. wanna discuss wat to buy for our BBQ nxt week.. walked back to my hse void deck.. discussed what to buy liao.. but.. haven’t book the BBQ pit.. n still haven’t confirm how many ppl going.. sian.. halfway through our conversation.. one short fren of ours, a neighbour of mine.. pei sin greeted us… we joined as in talking.. once she sat down..hui kept calling her shortie n teasing her.. lucky she is not those petty type.. or she is used to us calling her shortie?? Haha.. bad rite.. this is how we make fun other one another.. happily talking abt our pri sch life.. it makes me realized how happy life was back in primary sch.. we buddies.. hui, fan, zhneg, desmond, zheng lin, hock yong.. n the gers.. gin, pei, wei li, melody, melody, yuet ling n charmaine.. how much fun we had together.. but life wasn’t the same anymore after we graduated.. every one left for diff sec sch except fan, zheng n me.. we were posted to chai chee sec together n transferred to bedok nth togther.. we were very close.. but it was juz in sec 1 n 2.. the 3 of us r always together.. going for lunch after sch.. same cca.. came my hse here for soccer.. during sec 3 i n zheng left fan.. we were attached n we felt unfair to bring fan along n leave him alone.. but in sec 4.. all of us went diff ways..
I n zheng got so distant.. he turned so diff.. till I almost cant recognized him.. wat had happened to him.. we lost contact wif him.. everytime all of us meet up.. he is the onli one not turning up n not answering our calls.. not once, not twice, but thrice.. wat does this mean?? He has forgotten abt us?? Having news frenz n forgetting the old buddies?? Haiz.. how I wish I can turn back the time.. we miss him very much.. n dun wish to lose such a good buddy… things can nv be the same anymore.. haiz.. chatted till around 12 n went back for soccer match..
Miss her very badly.. msged her.. she told me she having a bad sore throat.. very xin ku.. got so worried abt her..
in the morning she said she is fine.. but now.. haiz.. medicine not effective.. dunno wat lousy medicine did the stupid doctor gave her.. she dun haf watermelon powder at hm.. wanted to go buy for her but remembers shop closed liao.. nvm.. tml I go buy for her.. asked her to drink salt water instead.. hope she will be fine soon.. how I wish I can be wif her taking cr of her..
