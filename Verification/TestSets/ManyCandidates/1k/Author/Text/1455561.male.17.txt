the blog about hats has created only more questions  what is the plural of moose?  applying normal english techniques would suggest mooses but it doesnt seem right to me  if however we look for a precedent of a similar word we find goose which changes to geese  so does moose = meese?  or even the more mystical meeses?  or it may even take after the sheep which in plural is unimaginatively called sheep  this truly is a predicament.
hats.  hats!  hats?  when it is cold, keep warm. understandable  when it is sunny, keep the sun out of your precious little face.  understandable  wearing hats all year round? wearing very thin hats in winter? very thick hats in summer?  it would seem that some people enjoy the novelty affect a hat has on the silhouette of their head  or maybe use the hat for storing things, maybe pennies, or more sinister things like animals, medecines, or smaller hats  maybe on a day when your hair simply refuses to believe in gravity and will defy even the mightiest of gels/mooses (whats the plural of moose?)/waxes it would be suitable, even inginuitive to wear a hat.  but wearing a cap all year round seems to lack creativity, and i have learnt from experience it also indicates stupidity and unparalled agression in the wearer.  hats may be a source of power  this can be proven by stealing the hat from a lifelong hat wearer and shouting "i have their powersource" and taunting them with it.  nothing irritates them more.  until you urinate on the hat.  maybe the unique appearance a hat gives you makes you stand out in a way that seems to scream "look at me, i have a spectacular hat, be my friend, but dont get too close, i can be angry too"  there is little greater than the desire to put something on our heads e.g. hats, rugs and pants
the sitting on the tramps knee ride at alton towers was by far the best  at least i think it was a ride
What’s wrong with having pennies of the windowsill?  Nothing. Exactly  I find that I am given pennies from buying things that cos £X.99.   they are annoying, and too many of them are heavy and they take up space that could be taken up by more valuable tender.  I don’t have any valuable tender but I might get some and don’t want to give it to a cat as my wallet is full of pennies  So where do you put them.  I used to throw them out of the window onto a forest area with the idea that some exceedingly dull future person with a metal detector would get some excitement out of finding it, and the find would make him more dull as he added it to “the pile” of pennies and tennis balls that reside in the forest area.  Or at least a pigeon might choke on it  But then I discovered that the windowsill was about 10 cm by 150 cm of wasted space.  You couldn’t store a car in this area, or even an enchanting hat, but other things would fit.  Paper work would get soggy and blow away, a pet cat has already been tried on the windowsill: it fell off.  Pennies wouldn’t blow away though and if they get a bit rusty, I don’t care.  In fact I want to hand over pennies that although have a date of only 2002 on them, are rusty, green, and look diseased.  It was perfect and although I may never actually spend these pennies (no not that metaphor), whenever I am looking for something to talk about, I can stare the person deep into the eyes and say “I store pennies on my windowsill” and they will think I am very wise.  Probably.  Actually, looking at them now, I can see that I need to turn them, they are only rusted on one side.  Although maybe that is better, even more mystifying to a cashier to have half shiny, half green pennies handed to them.  Upon seeing this they may think I am very wise and will maybe wish to hand the money back in awe of what I have achieved.  Maybe if I cleaned up some old pennies and added them to then rusty new pennies I could claim I was a time traveller, then maybe if I claimed to be looking for sarah connor they might give me a motorcycle.  Anyway, I think they need some salt.
Man united are worth hating because  1) they rejected the FA cup to play in a more financially rewarding competition, only to go out first round, come back and claim that that years FA cup was pointless cos they weren’t in it  2) peter kenyon is trying to get the FA to allow them to play on Saturdays at 3pm to allow for more televised games.  Despite the fact that this would ruin all smaller clubs who would see gate sales drop, reducing their already precarious finances.  3) alex ferguson using the media to try to win games by undermining the opposition.  4) The glory hunting fans from oxford, bath and singapore who support the club for no other reason than cos they know they will win i.e. my friend supports united cos his mum does, she supports it cos she fancied george best.  Therefore he supports them for no other reason than george best’s thighs  5) Being the first club to go PLC and so being the club that changed football from a sport to hard cash.  So liverpool get money to improve the club and become great, united get money to please the shareholders, improving the squad and being entertaining are second to this  6) Due to the top 5 points they will be responsible for the demise of football.  7) Due to the demise of football, the popularity of rugby will rise  8) Rupert murdoch owns a considerable amount of their club.  Murdoch also drove football towards becoming business by creating the premiership, forcing people to pay £40 a
