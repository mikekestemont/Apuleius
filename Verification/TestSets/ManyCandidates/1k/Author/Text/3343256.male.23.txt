At this time, we are not able to identify a match for you.  We require that any match we provide be highly compatible with your values, beliefs and attitudes. This standard means that thousands of eHarmony users are often not matched right away.    We are optimistic that we'll find the right matches for you and hope you will remain optimistic too. We don't intend to lower our standards and you shouldn't either. We ask for your patience during this process and assure you that the right match will be worth the wait.   Translation: We're sorry, but there is no one compatible with you, even with the search area set on "The Entire World".    Ouch.
urlLink GuruNet  is an interesting little program I've found for those, like me, that sometimes look at a word and go "huh"?  All you do, is load this little program onto your computer, then you hold alt, click a word you don't understand, then release alt.   Then the program pops up and gives you a definition.  It's very nice, and very useful.  Hope its useful to someone out there.
...its because I don't understand it well enough myself.  So, if you read anything, and go "huh"? Be sure to leave a comment on what you don't get.  That will help me focus on what to learn more to make clearer.  I'm looking more for concepts that I either seem to take for granted, or anything else that I haven't explained clearly, rather than words you are simply unfamiliar with.    Thanks, this will help me lots. :)
How to review a book of such a powerful message in such a short space, I have no idea.  This book is one I would recommend to anyone who is serious about doing something with their life.  It provides the tools necessary for a person to get past the issues that hold the vast majority of us back from reaching our potential.  The prime power of this book is its ability to create a paradigm shift in your way of thinking.  For those who aren't familiar with that term, here is how the dictionary defines it:  A set of assumptions, concepts, values, and practices that constitutes a way of viewing reality for the community that shares them, especially in an intellectual discipline.   We are all brought up with a certain way of looking at the world, of there being certain truths to things.  This book helps people to shift their paradigm of the world to be able to see situations and problems in a whole new light.  This paradigm shift if the whole basis, in my opinion, behind this book's power. A quote from Einstein in the book reads:  The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them.   The way we view the world significantly impacts our ability to affect the world.  Very briefly I will try to run through the 7 steps listed in the book.  1.  Be Proactive : It sounds almost cliche to tell people to be proactive, but it's an important basis to begin at.  Many people let others control their lives, either through expectations, or hatred of other people determining your actions, or simply doing something you've always done just because that's the way you've always done it.  In short it means being responsible for your life.  Which simply means being able to choose how to respond to situations instead of just reacting in a pre-programmed way.  2.   Begin with the end in mind :  Why do you do what you do?  What drives you? What do you want to accomplish, what do you want to be remembered for?  What makes you different from everyone else around you?  Whereas the first habit tells you that you  can  have control over how you act, the second habit tells you where to direct that control.  Or more accurately, it gives you the tools to let you determine the direction.  3.  Put first things first :  This habit is basically the time management chapter.  But not in the traditional sense of scheduling everything out.  Rather it teaches you to do those things that are important yet not urgent.  Think of it as preventive maintenance.  It helps to remove the constant panic of crisis management, and gives time to build relationships and plan your vision for your life.  With this habit you put the first two habits into action.  Together these 3 habits work to make you an independent person, able to determine your own future.  4.   Think Win/Win :  This habit is the first of those for dealing with other people.  It's a strong message to give, and one that I personally fully agree with.  The message is to, in every situation, see a path that is mutually beneficial for all of those involved.  Instead of just looking out for yourself, look for what is good for everyone, because you never deal with a person just once.  If you question the validity of this habit, just consider for a moment how you feel towards someone who wants you to do something and that you feel has no interest in your own well being.  5.   Seek first to understand, then to be understood : This is the chapter on  urlLink Empathy  that I wrote about earlier.  I can't really add much to what I said in that post, other than that if you want to get the most out of all your relationships, learn to look through the other person's eyes first.  Once you do that, they will then be willing to look at the situation through your eyes.  6.   Synergize :  A fancy word that simply means that the whole is greater than the sum of two parts.  This habit is strongly related to the previous two.  By looking for a mutually beneficial solution, and understanding the other's point of view, you can accomplish so much more together than simply adding together what you could do separately.  7.   Sharpen the saw :  This habit is about taking the time t
