Well then. To begin. Tonight began as a night like any other in the summer. Hot, humid and, as always, at Noah's house. There, at Noah's, the Super Friends of Arlington gathered. Jeremy, Paul, Eric and later Siping. With our Super Friends Travis and Chris abroad, we were forced to defeat Mega Stan and Queen Juliet's food of doom.        Jeremy singlehandedly defeated four burgers, three hotdogs and countless chicken wings. Paul overpowered at least ten unsuspecting chicken wings. Noah and I ate a burger and three wings each because we, uh, were saving room for desert. Yeah, thats it. Desert.        Anyway. Moving on to Robbin's Farm, we encountered hordes of pre-pubescent teens trying to fight. We had brought a bag of cherries with us, which for some reason caused some giggly little shits to act like they new us. Damn.        Glowsticks were for sale so naturally I bought two. At dark, we settled on suicide hill until the fire works. We made fun of people and Siping, while kids from our school thought it would be fun to start a shaving cream fight with the six of them. Silly kids, shaving cream is for riots and fun stuff, not the fireworks!        We heard another gaggle of people behind us that we knew wishing they had glowsticks. Every time the would-be-rioters dropped a glowstick, we threw it to the gaggle. This was fun for a while, but it got old. Then, just as we contemplated our swift departure, we noticed a pair of glowsticks caught in a tree. The only option we had was to retrieve those glowing strands of bliss.       Jeremy, Siping, and I set out with sticks and rocks to hurl at the glowsticks while the growing crowd held it's collective breath. After Jeremy threw a root from a small tree he pulled out of the ground, he broke the small plastic connection holding the glowing ring in place. To our surprise, the crowd began to cheer. Then after like three seconds it stopped and we became normal people who no one cared about again.       Other highlights; Jeremy tackling Tom Fitz when Tom was being stupid; Me yelling at some fat, balding  30 year old loser with a laser pointer; and the fireworks ending so we could leave.        Overall a good night, which should end very soon with me falling peacefully asleep in my Air Conditioned room.       BTW: I am the official Word-Smithy; a smith of words. Word-smithies can be poets, authors, play rights, but never George W. Bush's speech writer, or Mr. Woodcock. Stay sat.

Good morning Viet... Arlington. I'm here in lovely Webser, New York. I've pigged out on turkey, cranberries, special family jello, and mashed potatos. Yes, yes, I know. It's been months since I even thought about posting here. Sorry. I hope none of you contemplated suicide while I was away. I'm back now and everything is gonna' be alright. So. School. First term was a wake up call. I moved up in english and math on level and realized that it would be harder. I scraped by with low a's and high b's, but I earned a C+ in math. Boooo... Semi-formal. Good enough to write about, at least. I danced quite a bit, made a few new friends, and left just as sober as I was when I came in. Funny story: while I was dancing, I saw one of those little bottles of liquor roll across the floor. I heard a bunch of people got kicked out, but mostly for fighting. My trip to Montanta... in August. It was pretty fun. I went fishing with my cousin, ate  way  too much food, and was generally lazy. What have I been looking at lately, you ask?  urlLink http://mehalan.proboards23.com  - This is my friend Requiem's board. Great if you are from AHS because there is, well, an AHS related board.  urlLink http://www.spymac.com  - My all time favorite Macintosh related website. Boards and galleries for your pleasure.  urlLink http://www.megatokyo.com  - Web comic about the antics of Largo and Piro.  urlLink http://www.joyoftech.com  - Another web comic about geeks and their gadgets.  urlLink http://www.machall.com  - Yes.

It has come to my attention that a certain someone, actually one of the 3 people that read my blog, wants his name mentioned. Noah. Oh yeah. Travis. Kevin. Anyway, even if this heinous thing hadn't come to my attention, I would have mentioned Noah anyway. For tonight, I have been invited to a partay (yes - AY!) at Noah's house. If you are coming bring party supplies. Last night, I went to Travis's house, watched Futurama, then went to Kevin's and watched the simple life. Paris Hilton is fiyiyine. Nicole is not-as-fiyiyine-as-Paris-Hilton-fiyiyine. I'm so jealous of that guy that Paris and Nicole are staying with. If the season ends and he is still a virgin, he should kill himself. Time to go have a ham sandwich and wish the Hilton sisters were coming to my house. Peace.

Do you know what is completely unnecessary? Any of the discovery channel's animal shows. Do we really need to see that many snakes, tarantulas, scorpions, lizards, phirrana, crocodiles/alligators, sharks, whales, dolphins, monkeys, birds, kangaroos, and large cats? Honestly. Why do they have so many? I think it's all the animal sex that keeps people there. Animal shows have even penetrated the country's favorite mid morning talk-show, Regis and Kelly. I was watching the special episode this morning that showed all those wacky (their word, not mine) antics (their word) that Reg' and Kel' took part in this year. A tarantula crawled over Regis's head. The audience screamed a lot. Was it a "wacky antic"? No. It was a dumb white guy who doesn't know that if an animal can kill you, it's best to stay away from it. Now he's right up there with all the other cock blocking "croc' hunters". Big deal Regis. I w
