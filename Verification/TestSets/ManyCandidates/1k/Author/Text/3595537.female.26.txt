Bar manager wasn't in when I handed in my application so now I have to wait for a call back.  Not hopeful since the form was so basic and didn't allow me room to put much more than education and my oh so irrelevant work experience.  Boo-hoo.  Just now, I got offer to ride in Civic Type R this saturday and I can't believe I had to turn down once again.  Plus it would have been a ride all the way to Thorpe Park and free entry too... Arghhh!!  No ride, no sexy engine, no theme park.... I'm gonna cry!
The tune to this is stuck in my head! I don't even have it on my mp3...   Why do they call you sexy, I'll tell you why they call you,  Cuz your pants be sagging & your smile be banging,  A cool little gangsta style - baby    Why do they call you sexy, I'll tell you why they call you,  Cuz your hips be showing & your lips be singing,  There's so many reasons to call you sexy
Looks like I can start filling out my application to work at Boudoir and maybe memorise some favourite / classic cocktails too.  My DB contract says I must get permission first but shouldn't be a problem so long as there's no conflict of interest.  Feels like I've told everyone about this (except colleagues).  Will be awfully embarrassing if I can't even get a job to work in a bar.  Then again, Fai said it's a profession... and this is quite a nice bar.  I want to mix drinks, I want to create something that people can enjoy, and I want to grind mint leaves to music, haha!  Please let them love me enough to want to train me up! I will be so disappointed otherwise...  I can't believe I'm applying to work in a bar before the floristry thing!  I have to say, this is mainly for fun... where as floristry was a business idea involving financial risks etc... making it somewhat more daunting...  Well, that plus the fact that I can't drive means I haven't pursued any casual work in a florist. I'll see how I feel after I pass my driving test!
Was going to take some presents over to my cousin mid-week but due to the oh so annoying (and too damn frequent) planned industrial action of RMT union, I had to rush home today to collect the stuff and then make my way over to golders green to meet my cousin who's got an exam tomorrow.  Well, at least it was warm and sunny and the tube wasn't packed either. Hm, maybe that's why they're going on strike - cos the weather's too good to be working underground etc.  When are they ever going to change the legislation or whatever to stop them going on strike ALL THE TIME?! Geez, this country is so backwards. We should all go on strike (by creating a  National Go On Strike Unless You Are a Train Driver Day ) and see how the train drivers like it.  Hm... no, we could just have a national holiday for canteen staff then train drivers wouldn't be able to take a long break that day... or a national holiday for toilet cleaners so drivers don;t spend ages on the bog and then maybe our trains won't be delayed 'due to a queue of trains ahead'...
Alrighty, I'm  getting fitter  then!  I've been walking up them stairs at work for over a week now (I'm on the 5th floor) and sometimes, if I remember, I'll walk down at the end of the day too.  This morning though, I managed to walk to the 6th floor and I didn't even realise until i opened the door! Duh!
This is just a short list, in no particular order, of things I think girls get obsessed with including me! Yeh, yeh, I know, I'm way too old to be calling myself a girl but you know what I mean! Anyways, the list:   Perfect jeans  I spent several months hunting!  and finally bought 2 pairs in 1 week. One is Meltin' Pot (don't know it's origins) and the other is from Zara.  I think Anita said there are some jeans from Brazil which are really good and give you fabulous legs.  And I just read that Zanuk jeans give you a nice arse, as spotted on Cameron Diaz (I love her!).  Guys don't generally have this obsession cos they wear their jeans fairly loose but maybe some of them should start doing us girls a favour by obsessing a little too!  This brings me on to...   Does my bum look big...  Um, I have to question this one.  If your bum is too big, wouldn't any other part of your body be big as well? Like your thighs?!  I wouldnt mind it big if it looked pert too!  I actually hate my arse cos it's flat.  There's just no way mine is sexy, even though someone once told me I got a sexy arse....  I mean, I know for a fact that I have a more obvious asset!  It's true that you should never tell a girl she has a big arse.  Even if you've got to lie, tell her it's sexy, and she will adore you!   Black trousers, black coat, black cardi, little black dress  These items are for when we want to look good without standing out or for when we are feeling fat! They are what I call the 'slimming staples' of our wardrobe and like the jeans, we usually have several... never too many!  They're versatile... but if made of cotton, tends to fade so we definately need loads!   Calorie and fat content  Maybe not all girls are calorie counting but most seem happpy to let you know how many calories and grams of fat there is in what you eat! I read somewhere though that people who are overweight tend to under estimate how many calories they have eaten, and those who are underweight tend to over estimate...interesting huh?  I
