mugful coffee. tainted tongue. blank mind. garage sale on conscience. cleanin up the mind.   but its not soundless enough.  not enough.  i'm sittin still...
Back from design Agency and realized that I’m the kind of girl who throws junks in the office drawers, and get jealous whenever I see neatly arranged pinky stuffs in somebody else’s drawer.  I wish I were more girlie and tidy. I wish I had pinky stuffs.
Somebody who's smiling at me for no reason at all spooks the crap outta me.
Today is one of those days.  One of those days where i dont want to be friendly with ANYONE.  Where i'd shoot people with my cold stare if they dare to come my way.  Where i cant/wont tolerate stupidity. Even the smallest amount. even when disguised as naivete.  Where i would turn around and leave a person if they dare to utter comments with even tiniest amount of idiocy.  Where i look pass guys who are cute as hell and walking around with their asses hangin out.  Where i want to have one sign across my forehead saying, dont touch, i bite. The other one across my chest saying, dont look there either, asswipe!  This is one of those days where i just HATE people. No matter how nice they are.   Ya, fuck off. I dont like you. Cunt.
Remember that getting over, move forward kinda thing i posted a while ago in my other blog?  Well things really going on ok. This getting over thing seem to work out pretty well for me. and I actually feel relieved that i've done these things (get rid of everything that has even a remote connection to "G" - the guy). I dont really think about him that much anymore. and I am actually happy.  Until last Saturday night....  I went to my friend's Drew and Amirha engagement party. I had fun.  Met a lot of new people.  had a few laughs and good conversations. It was nice, it was familiar and people are amazingly nice to talk with (i am not sure whether I owe this to real good Italian wines or the very nice romantic settings or just me getting back to my good ol' flirting mode that i left gazzilion years ago). Anyway, i had a blast. Hours ticking by, and beautiful people keep on coming, flowing champagne and real good wines, and I am beginning to feel so much at ease.   And then enter "D".  A writer who has lived in this island for only 6 months, 32 yrs of age, wickedly irresistable, unconvetionally good looking and financially oh-my-god-what-is-he gonna-do-with-all-that-money kinda thing, funny yet a bit of a wise ass. This guy has been known as the guy soo many women wanna be with. Yet, he seems to walk around not knowing it.  The moment he walks in, people just seem to strike up a pose or something(especially the women).  People become flirtier, wilder, funnier, ....any other -er there is to er.  I, to my surprise, sucked in to this as well. I was.. i dunno, trying to smack up my mojo in triple doze. Holding my glass differently, smile a bit coyly, and tried to be as attractive as i can be. ( confession:  a VERY tiring job, i have to say). But of course, i mean.. who could compete with long legs,black curly hair,  big tits women with low cut dress.  It doesnt take long for me to drop this "hi, look at me" kinda attitude cuz I just suck at this. I mean, who am i kidding. 5'1 skinny woman with glasses who looks more like she belongs in a library rather than a party. and SHE should NEVER strike up a pose! Seriously. NEVER!  So i move my ass a bit to the corner, and start chatting with this very funny guy who turns out to be the artist i got exhibition invitation to. Not long we move to a table down the beach, cornering ourselves to a more delightful conversation. It was good, those cerebral connection kinda thing.  I really liked the guy plus I enjoyed his company. The drunken state has taken me into a more flirtier mode, when he leaned over closer to me, and flirt back.  We did this for some time, verbally flirtatious toward one another.  And then he said something,  "I really enjoyed this. Do you have plans tomorrow night? I'd like to take you out to dinner."  I froze. All of sudden i felt this icy sensation of fear down my back, iced my blood and got me to stutter.    "unfortunately yes.  I have to work late tomorrow," He looked at me.  "On sunday?" Dupe. Tomorrow is sunday! i completely forgot! I smiled at him frantically trying to work out some good lies on WHY i have to work on Sunday. Then i came up with this elaborate lies about this (made up) presentation i have to do on MOnday, and i just have to make sure everything is in place.  But i guess, he could see through it.  He nodded as if understanding it, then told me that he had to go. He also has somekind of "presentation" to be prepared.  he got up, said goodnight. turned around and left me.    I was panged with regrets. I couldnt believe what i just did. I liked the guy very much, he's nice, smart, talented as fuck, and he just asked me out. What the fuck was i thinkin?     Why I backed out? I had a perfectly enjoyful conversation with this man.  I am attracted to him.  And from what i can see, he is attracted to me too (or else why would he ask me out to dinner).  Why the sudden Icy sensation of fear clamping up my back when he asked me out.  Why in the hell i feel like i want to turn around and run away from him. Why suddenly all i wanted to do was clamming up to my room and hide when he asked me that question. Why?  Anyway.. After h
