how odd are we all? keeping an online journal so anybody who's anybody can find out what we're doing on a day to day basis. id say we all never got enough attention when we were younger....  im bored... i could really go for a smoke, but its raining outside and that sucks.  lets see... whatd i do friday... i met up with kels at 2:25ish to go to work the phish show at 3 at alpine. so we saw kreger at the show and did nothing (and got paid for it) for like 2 1/2 hours. then my team leader forgot about me, so i didnt get a break till 10ish. i bummed a cig from some chick and it was a lite, so that lasted me all night until after everything was done and we were goin home at like 120 in the morning when i went up to some other girl and asked to bum one of her camels which she did give me. so then i went home and my sis was home from college and we sat in our driveway and smoked a cig and she told me how horrible her date went. then we went inside and talked about Bonaroo (cuz she went) over a beer. then i went to bed cuz i had to work at steins the next day.  which brings us to saturday. i went to work from 1230 - 9pm and during the day me jamie and katie decided we'd hang out. so after work i came home and took a shower and called them up and they came and picked me up. so we drove around and smoked 2 bowls of katies dank ass nugs, and then went to dennys. in the car, the 3 of us were geekin. so when we got into dennys, jamie went to the bathroom and when the waitress came, me and katie geeked for like 10 minutes (which was bad) cuz it was so obvious we were fuckin ripped. then one of our bosses from steins walked in with his girlfriend around 11 and we were like oh fuck. but nothin bad happened. later when i started getting tired and we were all done eating, katie went to the bathroom and jamie was like "youre tired arent you" and i said yea but i still wanted to hang out with em cuz i didnt wanna seem like i was having a bad time or anything, which i wasnt, but jamie was like "dude its no big deal, cuz i know you have to work at 9 tomorrow". my ripped ass was like ok. so they dropped me off at home and me and my dog sat around till like 130 watching shitty TV.   which gets us to sunday. i went to work at 9 (till 1) and it went by surprisingly fast. when i first got there jamie told me about how her and katie accidentally ran somebody off the road cuz jamie was fuckin around in her car and not looking and she ended up in the wrong lane, which made me laugh. then i went and worked till i got to leave.   cool thing happened this weekend. i found out jamie likes horror movies and reading about true murderers and stuff. which was really cool, cuz i like that shit too... i love scaring the shit outta myself for some odd reason. so anyway, jamie let me borrow a couple of books she has about scary people that were murderers. then i went home and took a shower and me and my brother went to best buy, circuit city, and soundwaves. i bought dead or alive 2:hardcore cuz its one of the only videogames i actually like, Gia, and donnie darko. and that brings me to this very moment... queens of the stoneage "No one knows" is playing. i like that song.
PRETTY SHITT!   lets see, everyday i have to wake up at 9 to get ready and go to summer school. then every couple of days i get to come home, take a 2 hour nap, then go work at Steins. and i have to devote a large handful of weekends to working at alpine valley (music theater) and thats not really fun, cuz you get there at like 11 in the morning and dont get to go home till 1 or 2 AM the next day! last year was pretty fun cuz we got to do whatever we wanted there, but now they changed everything and you dont get to walk around everywhere, you have to stay in one parking lot, and you get switched around, so sometimes you're working in the show but the only plus to that is you KINDA get to see the show, but the shitty thing is youre checking tickets and standing ALL NIGHT LONG.   so its not even worth trying to go out and party or anything cuz if its during the week i have to get up at 9 and go to school and then go work at steins, and if its a weekend im working at either steins or alpine!   now i know what youre all thinking.. yea but youll have money... WRONG! i still owe my dad like $450-$500 for car insurance and a large chunck of the rest goes into savings... FUCK SCHOOL, FUCK WORK, FUCK DEBT....this summer sucks
the life i used to have. my freshman year, i had two or three really close friends who would come over EVERY weekend and drink and smoke at my house. seriously for 6 months straight all we did was go in my basement and take shots and then around midnight we'd head outside and do stupid shit all night. we'd sit in cait's car and smoke or take walks down the road and smoke out of our homemade bongs and shit (occasionally we had a pipe) but thats besides the point. now everyone is stupid and doesnt know how to have fun. one of the close friends i had cant smoke or d
