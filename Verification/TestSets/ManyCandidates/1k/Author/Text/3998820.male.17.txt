I looked around the room.&nbsp; Everything was as it always had been.&nbsp; The old gray chair still sat in the farthest corner of the room.&nbsp; The painting depicting autumn in the forest remained on the east wall. Even those pictures of long-dead family members were still there, standing upright.&nbsp; They looked grand in those pictures.&nbsp; There was just something about the photos taken from 1920s&nbsp;to the 1950s that really stood the test of time.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I got up not knowing where I was heading.&nbsp; All I knew was that I had to get out of that room for a bit.&nbsp; I felt sick inside.&nbsp; I didn't feel sick physically as much as I did emotionally.&nbsp; That dream had stirred me up.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   It's funny&nbsp;how an individual&nbsp;can simply pass off most dreams; then one comes along which the person can't shake.&nbsp; It stays with him or her, sometimes for days.&nbsp; That's the type of dream I had just had, the latter.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I remember the dream vividly.     &nbsp;   I woke up in that same chair I had just gotten out of and realized there was something very different about my living room.&nbsp; It was empty.&nbsp; It seemed that way at first at least.&nbsp; Then I noticed something.&nbsp; The portraits of the family members that rested on the mantle, they were turned face down.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I slowly walked over to the mantle.&nbsp; I was about to pick up the first portrait, one of my mother's maternal grandparents.&nbsp;Then I heard the door close, and people talking.&nbsp; It sounded like a man and a woman.&nbsp; Turning around, I saw them.&nbsp; There they were!&nbsp; My great-grandparents! They had their backs to me, but it was them.&nbsp; "Wow," I thought, "how can this be real?"&nbsp; But it had to be.&nbsp; They were right before my eyes.     &nbsp;   I approached them without hesitation.&nbsp; "Hello," I said. They didn't respond.&nbsp; They carried on their conversation.&nbsp; I rubbed my eyes.&nbsp; When I looked up again, the setting had changed.&nbsp; I was in their house,&nbsp;and they still stood their, talking to each other with their backs to me.&nbsp; It was their living room.&nbsp; Everything looked as I remembered it.&nbsp; I remembered it so well.     &nbsp;   I tried once again to make contact; no luck.&nbsp; I turned around and started walking towards the spare bedroom entrance, which was about&nbsp;ten feet away.&nbsp;I&nbsp;hadn't a clue&nbsp;why I was walking there.&nbsp;I noticed the door was closed.&nbsp; I knocked.&nbsp; It felt real. It was real.&nbsp; I heard a man say, "Hold on!"&nbsp; I replied, "No rush."&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Five seconds later, the handle turned and the&nbsp;door swung open.&nbsp; There stood a man of probably&nbsp;nineteen&nbsp;dressed in a nice early twentieth-century black suit and a derby hat.&nbsp; He said, "Hey Henry.&nbsp; How are you?"&nbsp; "I'm fine," I answered.&nbsp; He laughed.&nbsp; It was a laugh that sounded faintly familiar to me.&nbsp; It was a unique laugh, very unique.&nbsp;I couldn't place where I had heard it before.&nbsp;He looked at me and said,"I was waiting for you, Henry.&nbsp; I was afraid you wouldn't show.&nbsp; Henry, good old Henry.&nbsp; My old chum.&nbsp; Come on, we have to hurry.&nbsp; Go take a look in the mirror before we go.&nbsp; You've got some hair sticking up in the back.&nbsp;I don't think the ladies will be too impressed."&nbsp; He nudged me in the ribs and headed for the door, laughing.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I walked into the bedroom that&nbsp;he had just walked out of and found a full-length mirror.&nbsp; Something was wrong, very wrong.&nbsp; That wasn't me.&nbsp; No, that wasn't me at all.&nbsp; My facial features were much different.&nbsp; That hair was not mine.&nbsp; I was a bit taller now.&nbsp; I was also dressed in one of those black suits.&nbsp; I stood there looking at myself, but it wasn't me physically.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I heard footsteps coming toward me rapidly.&nbsp; It was him again.&nbsp; He smacked the back of my head and pulled my hair down, all in one motion.&nbsp; He laughed again.&nbsp; "Henry," he said, "We must be punctual.&nbsp; No time for us to play in front of the mirror."&nbsp; He walked toward the door again.&nbsp; I followed him.     &nbsp;   We walked out the door and onto the sidewalk.&nbsp; I looked to each side.&nbsp; Giant elms hung over the street.&nbsp; There were great old homes on each side.&nbsp; I hadn't been here before, or had I?&nbsp; In a way, I felt that perhaps I had once known this place.&nbsp; A car&nbsp;drove by&nbsp;us, a very old car.&nbsp; I wondered like I had never wondered before.&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;   He was way ahead of me.&nbsp; He was obviously in a hurry.&nbsp; "Come on, Henry!&nbsp; Hurry it up, will you?" he shouted.&nbsp; I picked up my pace. I saw him turn right about fifty feet in front of me and approach a&nbsp;large white home.&nbsp; As I neared it,&nbsp; I realized that it was a Victorian home, white with green trim.&nbsp; There was a large front porch and there was a small&nbsp;group of people sitting on it.&nbsp; They were all dressed in early twentieth-century clothing too.&nbsp; That man was talking to them.&nbsp; Who was he?&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Upon reaching the residence, I turned right and walked toward that porch.&nbsp; I felt so out of place, yet I didn't.&nbsp; I stepped up onto the structure hesitantly.&nbsp; "Come on, Henry!&nbsp; No need to be scared," he said,&nbsp; "I don't know what your problem is today, old boy."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;    &nbsp;   I had a better look at them now.&nbsp; There was a middle-aged man dressed in what was probably his finest suit.&nbsp; It was jet black.&nbsp; Every suit I had seen thus far was black.&nbsp; To his right was a woman roughly his age or just a bit younger.&nbsp; She was all dressed up too.&nbsp; She wore a floral dress.&nbsp; The flowers on it were yellow and white, and the background was red.&nbsp; Sitting beside the patriarch and matriarch of this family&nbsp;were their children.&nbsp; The daughter was seated to her mother's right.&nbsp; She was probably seventeen or eighteen.&nbsp; Her face was hidden by her cloche hat.&nbsp; She seemed to have her mind on other things.&nbsp; She really paid n
