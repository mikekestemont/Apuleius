Well, its been a while so I think im gonna write in the blog. Today was a pretty good day. I woke up late (not 6:45 as usual). I went to the gym to do some nice morning cardio...my mom went to the aerobics class. So after I finished the cardio, I was waiting for her to get out of the damn class but apparently the class never ends. So I did another 10 mins of cardio and they still weren't done. So I jus went to the aerobics class for another 15-20 mins. I don't mind it. All women except me :)...not that theres anyone even the least-bit attractive there.   Afterwards me and my friends went to see Spiderman 2. I was rele hoping that it would be good because I missed a good soccer game to see that movie. And thankfully, it was pretty sick. Better than the first one...possibly. One thing I found strange was that the theater was completely filled. Is it just me or does anyone else find it wierd that the theater should be full at 1:20 on a Wednesday? Doesn't anyone work on Staten Island?  Anyway, I'm home now. I plan on going to the gym again later to do some weight lifting. We ran out of the good protein shake, so now I'll probably hafto drink the crappy one...yuck..fuckin chocolate. I would seriously like to meet the idiot that thought of giving protein shake a chocolate flavor.   That's basically it for today. I'm going up-state this fourth of july weekend. Time to put that boating license to good use. Imma give water skiing another try. Maybe this time I can hold my ass steady on the skiis for more then 5 seconds. lol.   BTW, Nip Tuck was on last night. It was pretty cool. I love the way Christian broke his nose....for those of you who still haven't seen Nip Tuck, get the first season dvd! You won't regret it!
By the title of this post you could probably guess why I'm so happy. Unfortunately the happiness won't last for long. It appears as if my plans to join the track team this summer have been put on hold. In July I'm taking a math college course that I got a scholarship for. At the same time, I will probably be taking SAT Math/English prep courses. So that kinda blows. On the bright side, the college course is free, the credits can be transferred and it only lasts 3 weeks, so that's 15 days of class (each session is 3.5 hours long). The SAT courses are 2 hours long, I think, and they last the whole summer, but it's only once per week.   Anyway this year was tough, but I finished off with a 98.6 average. My parents are going to atlantic city tomorrow, so I get the house to myself. Sounds good, doesn't it? Well...not really. While my parents are away, I'll be babysitting my 7 year-old brother...so much for the beer and the bitches.   I was watching the European Championship in Soccer today. I don't normally keep up with sports on TV but I do keep up with major games in soccer. Wow impressive game. It was the Quarter-finals, I think... Holland Vs. Sweden. Incase you're wondering, Holland won by a penalty shot. It was a pretty amazing game. Which brings a question to mind. How do so many Americans find (American)football and baseball so fasinating? A soccer game is intense, people constantly running back and forth, the whole tide of the game could change with one shot. People literally pray and cry in the stands during a soccer game. In american football or baseball, the guys are standing around half the time. Especially in baseball, half the time all you see is te guy getting ready to bat. Come on! Where's the suspense? Where's the drama?, Wheres the action? .....boring! It doesn't make sense to me how soccer is the major sport in every other country in the world except America. But oh well, to each his own I guess.
So it’s Thursday. I really need something to do. I mean all this physical activity gets boring after a while. And I do consider myself pretty physically active, a lot more than the avg kid at least. Between the 3-mile morning jogs, weight lifting, aerobics, swimming, basketball, and various other activities, I get worn out. But I’m looking for other things to do. God I need a girl, lol.   Staten Island is such a boring place it’s scary. There is very little to do, especially when you don’t have a car. Staten Island barely has any clubs (or at least good ones), and really no place where you can just go to hang out with people your age or w/e and mingle or meet new people or w/e. All it has is a couple of movie theaters. Other than that you can entertain yourself with sports or electronics. It’s really sad that technology has brought us to a point that we have more people socializing through the internet than in real life. And I’m not talking bout Instant message/email. I’m talking about games on the internet like MMORPGs and stuff like that that people spend hours at a time playing. I don’t blame these people at all. It’s the fault of society as a whole.   Anyway that’s all for now.   BTW- I hope everyone reading this has a great summer, seeing as though school is pretty much over.
I was workin out at the gym last night. I was doing alot and I took pretty heavy dumbells and kind of dropped them. I'm ok but I have a pain in the upper part of my right arm and the lower part of my left arm. It's not that bad, I can still work out. It's just an annoying type of pain like when you over-stretch or something. Hopefully it will go away in a couple of days. Today is my day-off-from-the-gym-day so all I did was some heavy morning cardio. Tomorrow i'll p
