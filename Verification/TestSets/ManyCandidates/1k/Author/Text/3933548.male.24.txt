I completed my primary education in the year 1994 from Vidya Sagar which now changed it's name to MGM School. The medium was English and English medium schools were very rare at my place that time. it was located in the nearest town to my Village. The town named Mananthavady was the cultural and business centre of Wayanad District.                  Then I  completed my high school studies in the year 1997 from St. Catherines HSS Payyampally which is located very near to my home. During that time my father was the principal of the school and my mother was teaching there. So I had great responsibilities. It turned out that what ever I did in the school became a talk. So I the situation forced me to be an ideal student always. Otherwise my activities would throw mud on the images of my parents.                   Later I joined St. Joseph's College, Devagiri for my Pre Degree Course which was locaed it the neighbouring district to my home. I was a student in the science batch(Mathematics - First group) I stayed in hostel there and completed PDC in the year 1999. Now the Pre Degree System no more exists. I was lucky to be a student of last batch of PDC in the state. Because government changed the system to Higer Secondary Education from 1999.                                In 1999 I attended the state engineering entrance exam and got through it. I have an option to take the engineering seets available in the state. I opted for Computer Science and Engineering in Govt Engineering College, Wayanad. The college is situated in Mananthavady and I joined the college. My batch was the first batch of my college. I opted for the particular seat because the institution was very near to my home. I finished my B.Tech programme in the year 2003. The college was affiliated to the University of Kannur.
I Live in the beautiful village Payyampaly located near the bank of Kabani, which flows to the east. My village is located in Wayand distric which is a hill range area. It does have beautiful landscapes, snowy forests, a fantastic place. I always love to be in my village eventhough I can't because my work place is located in the Garden city of India "Bangalore".       Payyampally is covered with amazing greenaries. I completed my school from payyampally(St Catherine's HSS). The village is occuppied with Christians, Jains and Hindus. And we have a great tradition of communal Harmony in Payyampally. The silent nature, greenary and the good people always force me to go back to Payyampally and enjoy Payyampally
When you are fed up with something or you have to do nothing, play your favourite song or musical peace. This peace of music generally may not be favourite for others. But you may not disclose it generally, because you also want others feel that you follow the latest trend.     Spend the time listening to it, if possible close your eyes and don't involve in anything else. I am sure that by the end of it, you will have a new idea in your mind. You will be in a hurry to do it, not even able to finish listening to the music. I believe that everyone will have a few musical collections which will definitely innovate them. Music heals the world. It heals your mind.     I have tried this many time and the result was amazing. Even I was able to solve deadlock situations after spending a few minutes dedicated to my favourite song. It creates extra energy in your mind and body.      You will be feeling tired after watching a new nice or great movie. You will be tired after watching a whole cricket match even when your team wins. These kind of recreations give us rest and comfort for the time being but it drains your energy slowly. But I am sure that a heart touching muiscal peace will make you feel more happier.     Try this. It will definitely solve some of your problems. The great Karnatic musician Balamurali Krishna has done a good job in this field. He is engaged in giving treatment to many-with only one medicine "music".
