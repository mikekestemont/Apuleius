I was just wondering what if  urlLink Friendster  had another feature called "chatster". In this case, any chatting-oriented programs would be at stake. By then, the guys at  urlLink Friendster  would have probably thought of creating online games. And personal websites or blogging tools (instead of just the cliché profile). And your own  urlLink Friendster  mailbox (by the way, instead of waiting for a notification in my mailbox, I'm going directly to my  urlLink Friendster  account to see if my network is expanding).  Later, an online currency (so you could buy, sell, or auction stuff while doing the routine hi-may-I-add-you-to-my-friends-list activity).  Then, an extensive user search is likely to follow (consider keywords related to "most time spent chatting", "website-award winning", "most selling items", or even "Fraudster").  With all that, we might say, "Now, who needs the Internet anymore?" Glad is not about to happen anytime soon.  I am actually waiting for the time it does not have "beta" tagging along, but "We regret to inform you that  urlLink Friendster  is no longer operating due to lack of financial support" on the screen (to make it less cynical, try this: " urlLink Friendster  is now teaming up  urlLink Yahoo!  and all free accounts will be limited to 200KB of images and 200 friends. Click here to register for a Premium Account.").  But before  urlLink Friendster  is history, I think I would just loosen up, relate to some stunning celebrities (who somehow manage to create an account despite their jam-packed schedule), and have testimonials done by cartoon characters.   [A  urlLink Friendster  user who finds delayed updates of  urlLink Friendster  is perfectly aggravating.]
Recently, some of my fellow mailing list administrators asked a mind-boggling question (no way, I'm just exaggerating this): "Why is everyone so quiet?" Or something like: "Where are you guys? What on earth have got you occupied?" Even the desperate one: "Look at the archives...I am the only person who does the posting."  I would say, blame it on  urlLink Friendster . With the six-degree-separation theory, now those virtual-people-person are turned more to adding up their friends list, uploading and changing pictures, submitting testimonials, and of course, the favorite approving things (I bet they never reject anything unless it blatantly hurts their cyber pride). With all the privileges, who needs a mailing list anymore? I mean, that dull, no-picture, full-of-forwardings, stack of emails (don't forget the annoying attachments)?  It seems that  urlLink Friendster  has all it takes to be the heaven of I-need-some-more-guys-to-be-linked-to kind of people. Taken  urlLink FIRO theory  into consideration,  urlLink Friendster  fulfills our interpersonal needs of inclusion—the feeling of being important, accepted, wanted. It also satisfies the human need of control by giving the right to decide which one they want to be associated with of all the users. And it surely gives a way of practicing the butt-licking approach (look at all the testimonials!).  Definitely not a place to exile as what the popular saying has on internet freaks. In  urlLink Friendster , it is exactly the opposite. You do need to meet people, telling them (even those you do not personally know) it would be great to have them listed, politely offering to type what they has to say about you. What a nice life.

This is cute.  urlLink Click here  to find out  what kind of angel you are  (girls only, cute guys are warmly welcome, though). Don't worry, dark angels are available for those who don't fit the word "angel".  Now, I proudly pronounce that I am a Warrior Angel!   (Wheww... Look at the picture. Can't imagine if I'm really dressed in that outfit. Boys, dream on! And stop the drooling...)  And here's what it says about a Warrior Angel:  "Guardian Angels are also known as Warrior Angels, because they are the army of God. Does not always mean that they are in war, simply that their job is to protect unwary humans from dark dragons, or other evil demons. Warrior Angels are not always friendly with humans, but they will watch over them all the time. Humans say that when a miracle happens, thank your guardian angel."  I love that.   [Not always friendly but protects people. Yeah right!]
The issue of smoking, I believe, doesn't have anything to do with gender. After all, smoking is merely an activity in which you light a wrapped-nicotine and inhale the smoke coming out of it. It's just like throwing a used can outside from inside your car. Itâs not right, but it's okay.  Smoking will absolutely ruin your health, whether you're a guy or a girl. The problem is: the so-called social norms of ours consider that smoking is a guy's thing. Hence, if you're a girl, you're not supposed to smoke--not because it's dangerous for your well-being, but somewhat because it's a form of discrepancy of your femininity.  It's a good thing that our society has an aversion to smoking girls. However, we need to clarify why we are against them. Should we forbid girls from smoking, don't say because they are girls. But because there's nothing about smoking. The great feeling they have during or after smoking is only an assumption, an exclusive notion, that would bring up more troubles rather than benefits.  I don't smoke, but I have a lot of friends and relatives (from both sexes) who do. I don't mind that in one condition: they respect me when I choose not to breathe in their smoke, and, they don't sway me, in one way or another, to smoke.  So, am I for girls who smoke (excessively, especially)? Yes, when it concerns the fact that it's their privilege as a human being. And no, when it's about health--mine and t
