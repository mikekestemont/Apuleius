Morning. Managed to not have any university commitments today, so I'm writing this in my local library. The computers here are about ten times as good as the ones at university so it's a good play. Trouble is, it ghas just filled up with the local losers who've got nothing better to do than hang around in a library. I mean how desperate do you have to be at 11 on a Friday morning.  Anyway, had to laugh yesterday. Attendance at lectues and seminars has been slowly declining. Mainly because the actual courses are as dull as s**t. Out of the immediate group of us that normally hang abouit together, there ended up being only two all day yesterday. The best comment was at the end of one of the lectures, who doesn't realise just how little everyone wants to be there. ' It seem that people aren't reading their lecture notes or doing their seminar sheets '. You think? Maybe it's because we've also got Monday and Tuesday off next week (due to some weird local holiday). Can't complain, though.   Yesterday I said I was going to enjoy the sunshine after having worked through the glorious day that was Wednesday. Well, as soon as I finished lectures I thought I'd sit in the sunshine for lunch. Trouble is, as soon as I went to do it,the sun had gone and stayed gone for the rest of the day. Typical.  Feeling pretty good about myself as I've managed to avoid writing this essay for my education course (it's not as difficult as all that). I suppose I should use this week- end to actually get it done, but it's not going to be the greatest one ever but I just want to get it done right now. Last night, I was supposed to go out with a friend for a friend of hers birthday. Kinda wierd but I was up for it, after all, alcohol's always good. Unfortunately, she was supposed to text me about when we were going to meet up but it never happened. I suppose they decided they only wanted people who actually knew the guy who's birthday it was. I don't care, I stayed at home with a few of my mates and flatmate and ended up watching  urlLink Red Dwarf  dvds. A little alcohol  may  have been consumed.  Here's looking for a good week end  Jack
Thursday sees the first day of the first test in England (so its guaranteed to rain). Thinking about this got me trying to understand the game in America. Mashed about this makes baseball.  I first got into baseball during the 2002 World Series. I think I couldn't sleep one night and just ended up watching it all. Trouble is, after two years you'd have thought I could start to understand what's going on, but I still don't get it. It's ok to have on in the background but I can't see anyone wanting to sit through three hours of it every day. And yet they do, so there must be  something  in it. It seems that all innings up to the ninth are just preparation for the final inning to kind of set the score. You get one pitcher who lasts 8/9 of the game and then go through half a dozen in the dying moments. It just seems as though something is happening and I'm missing it.  I've started to be able to work out which pitch is which once the ball has gone through to the catcher, and I guess that after years and years of watching, I'll start to be able to work out which pitch would come next. It just seems like a game of paper, scissors, stone with balls. The pitcher has a selection of pitches to throw and places to put it so he just picks one, the batter goes for it and if he's lucky he gets a hit. Where's the skill in that?  The other thing I don't get is the pitcher's simple inability to do his job. I've seen this quite a few times, normally in the eighth or ninth inning. If the bases are loaded, the last thing you want to do is walk the next batter because that'll give them a run for free, and yet what happens? Exactly. Especially since usually they've intentionally walked to load the bases.  I don't think I'll ever understand but I'll keep watching anyway  Jack
What a glorious week it's been so far! You can really tell that summer has arrived at last and yesterday had to be the best if all. Predicatable really, since I was at work all day, but it's really nice to sit outside at about eight in the evening with a cup of coffee in hand sunning yourself. Aah. Trouble is, though, I got woken up at six this morning eith the sun streaming through my window as bright as midday. Wouldn't have minded but my day today doesn't even start until eleven.  Funny incident at work yesterday. The Senior Sales, who's eighteen, engaged, but not bad looking was walking through the shopping centre when some strange person crept up behind her and pinched her arse! Being the sort of person she is, she turned straight round and gave him a wallop round the head. As soon as this had happened, she realised that the person she had just belted was none other then her fiance (and she's got a wicked right arm). How much wuld I have given simply to be there.  Was watching the ice hockey on TV last night. As there was no game they showed  The Season , the documentary series about my team following them through the course of the season that's just finished (well it has for us- we were knocked out embarrasingly last week). Even though it's been more than a week since we were knocked out, I still can't get over it. I know that every year you think that this is your year but this year.... ah, well, only six m
