I rented Rallysport Challenge 2 and hope to play it online and whup the crap out of some people on there.. which I know I will so.. hmm.. not much more.. I installed two monitors... I don't know if they will keep them here buut it was worth the try and challenged my expertise lol cause I had many problems with the original monitor on the GeForce 4 MX440
