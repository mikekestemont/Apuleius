...is a horrible movie IMO. Saw this on Sunday at 3:20pm show with friends Veldan and Vernes (they're brothers) - very long, and boring...it goes like this. Fight, stop for a few days, fight again, stop for 12 days, two sides visit each other and are like friends what the fuck is up with that? and there were about 4 people gettin burnt (when they're dead, it's sort of a burial ritual only they burned their people when they died) It kinda got repetitive. Where did those $200 million went? Here's a tip next time you're making an epic film - hire a better writer.  5/10 too damn boring.  My day was alright though, went to church early in the morning then went to friends and we went to see Troy, went back to friends house, ate, made some music with  Acid Foundary , didn't get back home 'til 11pm. Now it's 11:38 as I'm writing this and I think it's time for some Contar-Stri
Well, just created this thing. I have a friend who's been using this 'blog' for a while, he shall be known only as the "Neusch Wanderer" yup, thats my good ol' CS-playing-junkie friend. Shout out if you reading this (i'm sure i'll link you to this as soon as you show up on AIM...) =) right then. Saw  The Day After Tomorrow  last night with a coupla friends; Alex Walsh aka "Steve Vasquez"  Mann Plymouth 12   at about 9:20pm 'twas already dark outside (ahhh I love it when it's dark and you're going somewhere i.e. movies, party..) we bought the tickets, Tom said that we should get the seats first and then buy food...so he leads us, and goes into the wrong room which plays the same movie only it's almost over. Hahah - then Tom calls himself a "dumbass" and we enter the right room. We spot Chris Griffin.......'nuff said, get the seats towards the top then go buy food. After that Bill Hendricks along with his cool 'rave' lovin' brotha and Steve Gallian (sp???) then a few other friends come in two of which both names start with  Eric  - Yes, I don't know their last names. So, I got to sit next to Alex - he put on his Steve Vasquez persona and proceeded to make me laugh, a funny guy I tell ya. So, let us talk about the movie itself. The first hour is extremely great it is very intense two main highlights of which where the scenes of  urlLink Multiple Tornadoes hitting L.A  and a  urlLink Tidal Wave hitting N.Y.C.  - when all was destructed, flooded, and washed away the movie turned into a slow and boring pace - which was the second half of the movie. I'm telling you, the movie coulda been a classic disaster film if they extended the disastrous events and done something about that damn second half! Overall it was a fun flick, it certainly had that feel of a "Summer Pop Corn" movie and I'm glad that I had fun. We then got into the car and cruised home lotsa talking about sex ensued between Alex, Tom, and his lil' fa...his brother Brandon while Myself and Guy remained quiet observing, and listening. When I got home (about 12:20am) I got online, called up my friend, "Big V" from Bloomington, and after an hour I went to sleep. Yes, it was a fun day last night, more of which will happen this Summer, DEFINITELY!   I am sorry for making you read this LONG and probably boring entry of this 'blog' but this is my first one and I felt it was an obligation to make it memorable. Adios, Amigos check back soon for something exciting from your's truly.

I've decided that I wanna get in shape, and I'm totally 100% serious about this. I've had enough of being miserably out of shape, having to worry about what shirts I should wear so my out of shape body doesnt show, swiming in the pool, hot tub, lake!   My plan is, neutrition #1  breakfast = salad, fruits  lunch = zone bar, or fruits  lunch = hearty meal  ---  Cardio #2  1) Run ONE mile non-stop, the other mile, walk fast, or run with small intervals of walking (Morning)  2) Run after dinner, in the evening, same as in the morning.  ---  Fitness #3  1) Pushups - 10+ (or til burns) = 3 sets 2) Situps - 20+ (or til burns) = 3 sets 3) Crunches - 15+ (til burns) = 3 sets  As I progress, I will add up running mileage, and fitness activities should become more harder.  Thanks a Lot to  Dawei  for some good advice. Appreciate it.  I'm excited.  Outie.
Today I went to Plymouth and got my permit back. Woohoo, now all I need is a license and a car - then = FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDOM!!!!
Tonight, I remembered how annually, I go to  Vali-Hi 65  which is a Drive-In movie theater in Lake Elmo, MN. It's maybe an hour+ long trip, but, extremely worth it. The place itself holds a parking space of 500 cars, that's approximately 1,000+ people I'm assuming? So, the idea is; to get my friends from Bloomington Veldan & Vernes (my usual partner's in crime) and Alex (who's trip will be the first to a Drive-In movie theater) Tom, Alex's friend + maybe some other people from school.  Now, when I told Alex all about the Drive-In, he had this to say...
