muzik: "Warsaw" -Swing Kids  so, ive recently been reading this book from crimethinc. called Evasion. is short, its the raddest, most illinest, and all-around tubular book i have read in a long, long time. as my first act of non-english class mandatory drudgery, i think im off to a good start.   its about a nineteen year-old straight edge punk who travels from Oregon to Minnesota by himself starting out with just under 40$. he hops freight trains and chills with hoboes, all the while shoplifting and dumpstering about ninety percent of his food. when it rains, he goes through back doors into college computer labs and listens to Chain of Strength while using the internet. god. i wish i was that guy. even though that sort of life is unsustainable, what not having a job, or a house... or money... it would be a nice challenge to see if i could survive like that for a little bit. when i turn 18 and graduate, its on!  so, keeping with that ghetto-ass theme, my grunge-master friend and i decided to do some salvaging of our own... illegal-style. we heard of this store, Big Lots on Mendo, that supposedly throws out DVD players and other cool, useful things. we walked across town and hit that shit up. opening a truck trailer, we were dismayed to find it empty, and promptly got the hell out of compton seeing as how the store wasnt even closed yet and we made a fairly large amount of noize. as consollation, we found a half used can of spray paint behind Community Market and proceded to... paint the town! actually, we both deathly suck at doing that sort of thing so it actually wasnt that epic. but still ridiculously fun, only heightened because of its blatant illegality. accomplices are welcome for our next expedition; partners in crime are always appreciated.  life is good for the moment. being more ghetto and loitering on corners is the way to enjoy summer. now we just need some 40's... hmmm. that and more crew members to be ghetto with. anyway, sign up now, itll be fun.  in other news: today is a nice day, all grey and cold. there need to be more days like this. going to get F-9/11 presale tickets today. somebody ILL, come with me.
I AM 84% ASSHOLE/BITCH!
time to open some windows, its dark in here.  "cassini is the most sophisticated interplanetary space probe ever. it will embark on a four year mission to survery saturn's moons, even passing by phoebe and titan." i want to work for NASA. space travel is hott!  so, summer certainly has kicked off with a bang. actually no, but it doesnt really matter. i cant wait for nikos and sean to get back from korea. then hopefully things will pick up... they cant help to. theres nowhere to go but up. if going to the JC means these first two weeks of summer stretched out over two years, i really dont think that i want any part of that. i think id rather die than have such a huge expanse of dead time. maybe doing school for one year really does outweigh being comatosely bored for two. hmmm.  i dont even know. there are like 6 more weeks or something of summer. leaving santa rosa needs to be in order. perhaps, if the necessary permission slips are returned, some sort of a road trip to like... washington... could be done. if not, maybe i should just blow my savings account on a trip to like tokyo. now THAT would be awesome.   speaking of which, i need to move to japan.  but yeah. this summer painfully illustrates the extent to which i have no actual connections to anybody in my life. friends are friends, and nothing really more. the notion of best friends is kind of dead now, nor does it really even matter. nothing ever gets done and feelings are never expressed. its sad, but for that at least, there is nobody to blame but myself. over the years ive never done enough to establish stong bonds with people, friends or otherwise. things simply drag on and i accept them, even when they make me miserable or cross. life is a series of drifting into peoples' orbits, and then drifting back out, never really taking or feeling any different than you did going in. which isnt to say that things remain unchanged. simply, its not an external movement, all of this. its a matter of changing inside, but the failing to relate that to how i deal with other people. people never really know whats going on, which is probably a good thing, but doing that makes life a hollow repetition of feeling dead and being alone. i dont know. i need to leave this shit. everything about this town, this state, the people i know- all of it makes me hate myself and everybody else for making me feel that way. its not their fault, its mine, and i just cant wait for this goddamn year to be over and be able to leave this all behind me. this really shouldnt be written online, but i dont mind. we fight our own wars, thank you very much.  muzik: converge "a farewell note to this city"
muzik: my own damn heartbeat (beating fast now because of stress and caffeine) and iron monkey.  if there were one person in the world whose life i could have, well, there would be many, but at the top of my list would be james bond.   nothing much more to say in regard to that.  oh, but wait: dad says that its high time that either a: i get some fucking zoloft, or b: shut the fuck up. pleasant. having parents that wish you were someone else is awesome, though i'm aware that im not the only person in that situation. life is iLL when people dont give a shit about you.  anyway, third hand information is great. i wish that was the only kind that i ever h
