Well...After Months of searching I have finally settled on a site for my Blog. Sam's DX was my inspiration, and Phil's blog was the finalizing factor.   More to Follow :-)
So at SS today we did debates. As some of you can imagine...    I FUCKING DOMINATED    It was awesome, anything they could throw at me I was able to refute then rebutt. It was in Formal debate fashion (excluding Hume and Rather) and it was fully political. There were three issues discussed. Legalization of marijuana ( I was on panel), Constitutionality of the new smoking laws (I presented), and Capital Punishment (Again on Panel).   The panel is essentially the audience who gets to ask any question they want at the end of the presentations. I fucking stumped those to whom I asked a question. (Usually seven part questions :)) I was also able to crush any pathetic attempts to deflate my case. I was against smoking in a room of smokers, and I still crushed any panel questions, and my opponent.   It was great for my self esteem. :)
Well...I had summer school today, and surprise surprise...it was the same old shit.   We are doing debates, but our teacher is such a fuck head that he didn't set it up right, and even chose our opinions for us. Fun. Well, I am supporting the new smoking laws in Massachusetts. He did this so as to avoid confrontation, which I would have presented. I hate him as much as Martin. Don't get me wrong...I hate Martin too. I hope Guido breaks her arm soon.   Yea...focus. So we went to the Library today. I gathered information like: A printout of the new law, the ingredients in Cigaretts, and other crap that no one in their right mind should care about.   Then, Mex picked me up, and I went back to her house to fix her Satellite reciever. (Turn it on). Then I got The Trepster and headed home. I got ready for work and then left.   I did more computer-based training. Fun. After getting about three hours into this beast of a lesson, I had to take my break and I lost my spot in the computer terminals. So I says to Lisa, I says, "I have forty five minutes and nothing to do." She had me shadow this oddly attractive guy I helped him bag, and then we had to get carriages. One of which hit my car. I am weird when I park, and I have friends who can attest to this. I like to park waaaaaaaaaaaay out in the middle of nowhere. Like, where the lights don't shine, i.e. the mugging havens.   I was harvesting carriages, and I see Treppy, way out yonder. Alone. With no cars around for ten spots at least. And a carriage with the corner having hit just above the rear passenger wheel. Argh.   Yep..well...that's about it.   TTFN

Nothing of Importance happened today.   The unnerving thing about that is that the King of England wrote the same thing in his journal on July 4, 1776.
Wow...I haven't written in a few eventful days. I think the four of us have finally reached a balance so we all float with our heads above the water. All is cool  Anyways...I started work, Did some other stuff, and got into/solved some minor conflicts. If you want anything more specific you will have to jog my memory...   I can't think of anything else.
urlLink    Trying out some new software, and I need a picture. I was too lazy to look for something, and print screen was right there....
Everything is all good again. Peace Negotiations have ended, and the texts are avaiable for Geneva 5. Or just ask me...And I will send it to you.   TTFN

Well...Sam, Phil, Dan and I have hit some more rocks in our friendship. I am certain that we will overcome. We are good friends, but, like the title indicates, shit happens.   I don't even remember why we aren't talking, it happens so often nowadays. Each person blames the other, and a whole feud begins. Its a really healthy relationship, thanks for asking.   As in any strong relationship, concessions have to be made. I think we are all just sick of having to concede. I know I get a triffle offended when they slit my moral throat. And I know that they get angry when I bring it up. So we all get really pissy. Its kinda like a weekly PMS. I admit I am just as sick of it as they are, but w
