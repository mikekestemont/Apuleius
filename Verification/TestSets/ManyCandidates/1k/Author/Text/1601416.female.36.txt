where have i been, you ask?  busy, busy, busy!  i am known as "julie the cruise director" to those who know me well.  i'm always planning something or have places to go, and people to see!  well this weekend was no different.  j.'s parents, sister and niece invited themselves over to the pool one day.  i don't have a problem with this, but j. seems to.  i also invited my stepsis over and her family.  why not make it a party?  it was a very impromptu thing and those are sometimes the best times!  it was a really nice, relaxing day in the sun, the sun even decided to come out!  i was so excited about it, i didn't put enough sunscreen on...ouch...don't touch my back!  the next day i went to my friend p.'s bridal shower. loads of fun!  the ruse that she was attending a scrapbooking session was the excuse used to get her there.  all week, i didn't want to talk to her, afraid that i would slip up.  i was supposed to be going to this scrapbooking soiree as well, but she hadn't mentioned it to me at all.  so, i ended up just sending her an email about it.  she called me and told me she was going and at what time.  i cold only giggle as i listened to her message...if she only knew...she had no idea that this was going to be her shower.  her family was having a surprise birthday party for her brother that night and she was convinced that was going to be her shower.  g. even had the sign in the atrium of the hotel changed to say scrapbooking instead of bridal shower to throw her off the trail even more!  when she walked in she couldn't believe it!  bridal bingo was planned during the gift opening.  what a hoot!  each square is filled in with something the bride might receive at the shower, cutlery, china, wine glasses, towels, picture frames, cookbooks, etc.  there were some real gamblers in the audience...wondering if candles could be considered a sexy item, and asking what every item was in a multiple-item gift in case it was on their card.  anything, to get a bingo!    after that, a few of the girls decided to continue the fun at a restaurant called sky.  they have the absolute best green apple martinis.  they taste just like a jolly rancher candy.  they have several kinds of martinis, so i tried a godiva chocolatini for my second one...eh, don't know why people rave about that!  it was way too strong and tasted like a melted mudslide!  after that i switched to beer.  we kept saying, this is our last one, this is our last one, but each time, it seemed like someone still had a full beer and they would say, ah, go ahead and order another!  we could have stayed there all day we were having so much fun!    last night j. and i went to the james taylor concert with b. & m.  it was a great night and we had fun, but jt is too mellow for me.  he had a 20 minute intermission in the middle of his set...i could have napped!  it just didn't flow well for me.  phew...anyway, that is what i've been up to...nothing like filling my plate up and going back for seconds.
and last night wasn't the end of my commuting misery...this morning, i planned on taking the later train because i wanted to sleep in a little after being out late last night.  well, don't you know, the train leaves 15 minutes late this morning.  everyone standing on the platform was mumbling something about no air-conditioning, blah, blah, blah!  geez, maybe i should drive in?  i'd be in traffic, but i'd have air-conditioning.  i decide to give it a chance, maybe these people are pessimists and don't know what the hell they are talking about.  i get on the train when it pulls into the station...air-conditioning is running just fine to me.  the problem today is, no double-decker cars!  by the time we got to the 3rd stop on the line, the car was looking like a can of sardines.  didn't matter to me though, i had a seat, and i was reading the 2nd installment of the harry potter series!!  with all that out of my system, i still have a couple of pet peeves to add.  do i dare?  ah, what the heck, commuting can't get any worse!  *  i hate when there are two people sitting in the 3-seaters on the commuter rail, one on each end of the bench, and a 3rd person wants to sit down, the person in the aisle gets up to let the person sit in the middle, rather than scooching over and letting them sit down  *  i hate when the person on the end gets off the train and the person in the middle doesn't mover over to the aisle  *  people who smell  *  parents who don't watch their children and let them run all over the train  *  the train gangs who sit at the same table every day like it is "their" table and no one else can sit there  *  people who talk too loud on the train, so that the whole car can hear them  ok, i think i'm finished....have a good day!
well, it seems like the public transportation warlords got revenge on me for my post.  this is how my commute home last night went:  i left work to catch the 5:10 train out of south station.  the train is always on track 5, so i get on and sit there, and enjoy the air conditioning. a girl comes dashing onto the train and plops down next to me and is examining her foot, which is in a blue flip-flop.  it looks like it was digging into her foot.  i've had this problem recently, so i said something to the effect of, "don't you hate when that happens?  you never know the s
