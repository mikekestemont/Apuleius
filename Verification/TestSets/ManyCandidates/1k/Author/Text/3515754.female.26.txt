So, Harry Potter Day has come and gone. I think I'll need to see the movie again before I make a final decision; right now I'm rather ambivalent. A few points:  What I didn't like: - Camera tricks that just looked cheap. Still no good CGI. OK, but not REALLY good CGI. - Not enough explanation about Harry's Dad, and how James' old friends ended up where they are now. They left out a few things that are going to be important later for background, and I'm not sure they were good decisions - No creapy Voldemort asides. Also, they left out the explanation of the Dementors and the Dark Side (used in that Star Wars kind of way). Also may be important later. - Guy who replaced Richard Harris was crap. Forgot his name, liked him a lot in Toys. - Not enough Quidditch. No Wood!  What I did like: - Hermoine punching Malfoy! That few seconds of film was SO worth the $10. It was everything I thought it should be. - Faster pace, and fewer classroom scenes. Those don't translate so well onto film. Although, as an aside, we aren't seeing nearly enough of Nevil(Sp?). - The guys who play Fred and George REALLY grew up. They're yummy. - Even with as much stuff as they took out, they were true to the spirit of the book.  My biggist problem is actually with a decision that I very much understand, but do not agree with. The movie is very obviously targeted to teens and young adults. Which makes sense, as they buy movie tickets. But this is a story about 13 and 14 year olds. The books become more mature as the characters do, and that's as it should be; I just think this movie went farther than it should have.  OK, now off to bed. Have to be up at 7 to volunteer. Nighty Night!
Well, Happy Hour Wednesday turned out to be interesting. No Ex, and the Boy only showed for about 10 minutes before running off to a work meeting, then to visit with Ex alone. Roommate K and AD and I left Happy Hour and headed over to the Neighborhood Pool Hall, where poor AD went on a bender which necessitated taking her out to the back parking lot to throw up, as she destroyed the bathroom.  Poor girl. We got her back to her place very late when she had stopped heaving, and stayed over to be sure she was OK. Roommate K left for work in the AM, I spent most of the day keeping AD company etc. then went to see the Boy who was working from home.  Hung around and had dinner with the boy, got home after dark. I was up at 7 this morning for reasons no one could describe, especially me. The door installers have been here since 8, which seems to me to be an exceptionally long time to install a door; but what do I know.  Tonight, great large group to Betheda for the third Harry Potter Movie. I've watched the first two movies and re-read the first two books this week in preparation. Great fun, should be a total blast. Especially looking forward to Hermoine punching Malfoy!  Woo Hoo; door installers just left. Now I shower, put in laundry, go to the store, come home to check on things, and go get my phone fixed. Stupid thing has conked out on me. The damn phone is brand new too; I've only had it two weeks or so. GRRRR. No clue what set it off; but if they say it's due to jostling I'll need to get a new purse. No way to avoid jostling and banging in my summer purse.  Well, I'm off. I'm sure I'll have to log on and review the movie later. Tah.
So, the Boy's Ex came into town tonight. Should be fun, especially if she comes to happy hour. Tomorrow night Roommate K and AD and I are going to the Democracy for America Happy Hour at Hawk & Dove. The Boy is supposed to bring her.  Right now, I am drinking entirely too much red wine and listening to the Chess soundtrack. Lovely musical. Love story, history lesson, and cold war leftover. And all revolving around an essentially dull board game! Also includes asides about colonialism and commercialization. Gotta love that. Great fun, especially the "Opening Ceremony", which includes the Arbiter's song, and the opening of the second act, more commonly known as Murray Head's 1980's pop classic "One Night in Bangkok".  In college when I needed a pick-me-up during a long night of studying, I'd listen to Chess (keep in mind I mean the original London Version here, not the crappy American Version), and the Alley Theatre soundtrack of Jeckyll & Hyde. The Broadway version is much inferior. Trust me. Do yourself a favor and find the original soundtrack. You'll thank me.  AW seems to be in the process of ignoring me, which I find vastly amusing as I came back early from my Grandmother's funeral in New England to throw her a graduation party she showed up late to, and then she forgot my birthday. Go figure that I'm the one IMing her and calling her and she's blowing me off. I don't know how much more I can really take. I understand that she's upset about the Boy and how much time I spend with him, but I told her from the beginning, if she needs me I'm here, just call or show up. And this was when I was working; I told her to come to my office if she needed me that badly. Her choice not to take me up on it, and to refuse about 100 invites to go out; now she's blowing me off.  Ah, "Nobody's Side". Excellent song, and just the mood I'm feeling.  Never be the first to believe, never be the last to deceive.  Words to live by.  Nighty Night. Gotta concentrate on the "Mountain Duet".
