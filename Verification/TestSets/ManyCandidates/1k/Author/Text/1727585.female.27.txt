i'm happy for bryce that his interview went well today but i will be mightily pissed off if he up and tried to leave before i do. it's hard enough to work at this place when he's arround! i did take the giant leap of committing to school though. finally had a chance to speak with the lady who runs the program and the final words is no way in hell will i be able to make the city center campus for this term. my options have all of a sudden been reduced to millwoods or ipsos and i categorically refuse to work here any longer than is absolutely nescessarry.  saw daniel today. he shaved his head. he's an odd little man but i miss him sometimes.  and the party on saturday is moving ahead nicely - rick and vaness won't make it what with the big race in cowtown and all but peaches and matthew, mena, bryce and danielle, sky... have all confirmed. should be a shindig but geeze i hope the kids can all play nice together or it's going to suck hard.  think it's time for me to have my daily ration of kettle corn
graaaaaaaaaaaaah !!  i am so insanely frustrated!! i serriously want to cry but that will harldy improve the situation now will it? my husband calls me just as he's getting off work and he tells me that he didn't have a verry good day. immediately the warning bells go off - with his track record i just get so damned nervous whenever he mentions even the slightest thing about work not being fantastic.  apparently today circled arround a complaint from one of his fellow operators that he was laying down on the job while the boss was away. and apparently this is the second such complaint in as many days.
geeze louise i feel so bad!   my partner and his cauc bitch (there's a story there) gave me a lift home tonight which was cool cause a) i'm lazy and b) they're just really great to hang with but shortly after they dropped me off they just about t-boned some dude up at the end of my street so naturally my knickers are in a twist the second he called me to let me know. i feel like somehow i'm responsible for that dillhole that turned in front of them (yes, against the light)   feh, i serriously need to unclench! they're both totally fine, just a little shaken  in other news - had a big pow-wow with the elders at work today. worlds of fun, oi. to be fair it could have been alot more painful but really all this meeting accomplished was to cement my confidance in my decision to 'pursue other opportunities'. the role of corporate shill has never sat particularily well with me and so it is that it's become harder and harder for me to work with a straight face. i can't be bothered to give a damn about a single, solitary thing in the place and truely, as a purported leader, that's a problem. oh hell, i know that's not true - i still care about people and things that happen at work and i wouldn't  really  want to wreck everything before i leave... that's the real problem for me: having to reconcile my burning desire to be fully completely apathetic towards everyone and everything with my inherent mother-hennery.  one with some sort of mental health backgroud would likely ask me if it would be easier if i just didn't give a shit - hell yeah it would! and that's why i  try  but still the little angel on the other shoulder says...  honesty - that's where it's at folks but how do we get there? i know i have trouble telling myself the truth with alarming frequency. but really, lying, denying, defying... doesn't get you any further, doesn't make you feel any better in the long run so what's the attraction?  to heavy for me tonight but something i'll likely think about for some time comming.
isn't this a hoot? i've wanted to put pen to paper (or fingers to keys) for some time now but somehow i just haven't gotten there yet. and, as is so often the case, now that i'm here i haven't the foggiest notion of what to do. the whole personal biography thing is great and all but that's not what i'm after, i'm looking for catharsis and retyping my life resumee isn't going to get me that.  song lyrics are always a pretty good jumping off point. or my day at the office. or my husband. or my cats. so what's the issue? just pick one!!  my husband: fascinating story. he farted in the shower this morning. and not just a wee little poot, no this was the gastric emission to end all gastric emissions. you have no idea how brutal it was. he's no bed of roses when he lets fly at the best of times ( honestly, who is?) and a hot and steamy shower is NOT the best of times. disgusting i know but it's like the stench becomes trapped! you can't breathe and you start to gag... serriously i had to get out of the shower, out of the bathroom altogether lest i yak all over my clean self.  my day at the office: naturally i shared this heartwarming tale with my partner at work (great guy, incidentally - i'll really miss him when i'm gone) and so it went, we started talking about spousal shower contact then miguel chimes in with his shower story. apparently he had often wondered, you know - since the water in the shower is hot and all, if his woman would notice if he peed on her while they were in the shower. long story short the answer was no. from anyone else i would think he was jerkin our chain but this one... not too sure.  and the song lyric of the day is : " i'm still recalling things you said t
