This peice of shit was actually printed in Vol 114      I think games need to have a cool story line to make them more intersting. Diddy kong racing was a great game becuase it had a very cool story line and it was an adventure racing game. They should make more of its kind.   Sergio Perciballi   Leamington. ON.      What Racing games with great story lines?!?!? Ya mean like more than One guy thought that his Camaro was faster than the other guys camero??? OH I get it! heres a "cool" story line for Mario fucking bowser fucking princess toadstool... FIRST HUNK OF TURTLE OR PLUMBER ACROSS THE FINISH LINE GETS A   raw-peice   OF PRINCESS TOADSTOOL'S SWEEET ASS   YAAAAY!!!!!!
This letter was  printed in NP Vol 114                In the intro screen for major league baseball featuring Ken Griffey jr. does ken say "homie G" or "call me G?" My best friends family is being torn apart by this confusion. please answer my question so his family's argumant can be settled.    Matt McTavish   Via the Internet      Geezus FUCKING christ Matt...If your friends family argues about that stupid fuckin shit you should find better friends like people that hang around alleys. I used to argue with mom about somthing Eddie Murphy said in some of his movies, but It didnt start to tear my family apart  IM hoping your exageratting a little bit on that if not your friends family probally pull out butcher knives to fuckin shit~can~carve at each other whenever the Keys to the family wagon come up missing.   I have played this game its obvious he says "call me junior" but then again your friends family probally wasnt paying attention cause they were to busy giggling at each others private parts.   Im actually convinced it was YOUR family you was whining about all along anyway. Matt your fuckin supa-mario-fuckin-stupid...an your moms a whore :D
This was a letter printed to nintendo in Vol. 20 1991           I am president of a club that goes by N.E.S.A Our motto is "that was easy." The other members and I are 17, and all toghether, we have finished 150 games. Members jason and Daniel have Game Boys that we play though big speakers during lunch--the teachers love that! I've gone as far as hooking up a Game Boy up to a guitar amp. At first it sounded obnoxious but after a few adjustments it sounded awsome. sometimes we get toghether and hook up out NES to a stereo. Some of the games ive finished are Dragon Warrior, Final Fantasy, Shadowgate, Snakes Revenge, and Ultima. Ive videotaped most of the endings so I can see them and show them to my friends without spending mega-hours completing them again. I also taped the cinema scenes and exciting conclusion to make my own "Ninja-Gaiden-the movie." I love playing my NES, but it doesnt take over my life. My first love is beating percussion, and ive even won some soloist awards at jazz festivals. A tip for Final Fantasy: Some weapons an armor have special magical powers; be sure to take advantage of them.      T.C Christenson, Agent 212     Midway, Utah          ZzZzZz...Waaah!!!! oh shit I almost fell asleep! First of all T. You want us to belive that Nintendo dosent take over your life...yet...most who saaay that are in fucking denial. 150 games??? For fucks sake Im not sure if Ive even played that many in my whole fuckin life an youre 17 wow! Gameboys games have a rep for bad repeating tunes so whats the fucking point in connecting them to your Amp? And tell me this...why in fucks sake would you tape the ending to a NES video game!? I remember beating Robocop and all the ending said was ... thanks for playing. Stay out of trouble.   I wished to god that I had just gotton killed by the fuckin dog instead...haha dogs killin Robocop n'fuck.   Anyway you just about sounded like a real Lame-fuck by trying to bore us with info on percussion an awards you may or may not have recived in grade school. OH yeah   Heres a golden tip: percusssionists get beat up like whiny homos afterschool run run ruuuun!!!!
Get on the cell phone call every NUN and preist you know.   What the fuck did I walk into today? dead motherfuckers everywhere and im still laughing at the jewish joke that bungle told me.

Whats worse? having some faggot cossack bash your goddamn fingers into a pile mash of some chickin pot pie lookin shit or having some bully skinhead nazi fucker gouge your eyeballs out with a fork that some fat fucking whale of a geman sucker just ate spaghetti with.           I wonder if some kid on the last end of his rope goes out and beats the shit out of some sissy wearing pink shorts and roller-skates because i said that kind of damn shits funny as FUCK.          & then who knows??? maybe il get a fucking medal   Yeah!       ....................................     ASDFGHJK  BOOG IF YOU READ THIS GOOD CAUSE SHORT GRASS LOOKS BETTER THAN TALL GRASS JUST LIKE A FUCKIN DISGUSTING PILE OF TACO MEAT ON A HOTT BODY WOULD LOOK BETTER IF YOU PUT A MACHETE TO IT.
