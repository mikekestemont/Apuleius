"Redefeat Bush"   This fabulous link sums up the actions of the moron that is our president:  http://www.tilenut.com/yo/BUSH_record.html  (the link function still doesn't work)
Internet Poll   Since today was voting day in PA, I have a question of my own for all you fine people out there:    Would you allow your significant other to move into your apartment if he/she did not currently have a job or any immediate propects?
If only...   "Cigarette smoke is the residue of your pleasure.  It permeates the air and putrifies my hair and clothes, not to mention my lungs.    THIS TAKES PLACE WITHOUT MY CONSENT!  I have a pleasure also:  I like a beer now and again.  The residue from my pleasure is urine.  Would you be annoyed if I stood on a chair and pissed on your head and clothes without your consent?"  Usually I don't mind cigarette smoke, but sometimes, I leave a bar smelling like a carton of stale cigarettes.  I'm not an advocate of outright smoking bans in bars and restaurants.  I just ask that the owners buy a freaking air purifier that does more than spark!
Blonde Moments and My Exciting Convention   It must be time to bleach my hair again.  I can think of no other reason why I have been acting ditzier than Jessica Simpson at the White House!  Below is a list of occurances when my IQ dropped sharply below that of Ms. Simpson's!  1.  KFC- I was watching a Kentucky Fried Chicken commercial on TV.  The announcer made a comment about  K itchen  F resh  C hicken.  I turned to Paula and Garland and asked, "What does KFC really stand for?"  2.  My accompanist- While checking my email, I came across one from Terry saying that she wouldn't be at the remainder of the choir events for the rest of the season.  I immediately flew of the handle, started calling people, yelling and screaming about the audacity of this woman.  About five minutes later, I realized that the email was from a choir member named Theresa Moncheck, not my accompanist named Theresa Matysik.  It's a good thing I didn't send her a nasty email!  3.  It's getting hot in here- While driving in my car on a warmer day, I didn't understand why the car was so warm, even with the windows down and the vent turned on.  After 20 minutes of wondering, I realized that the driver's side seat warmer was turned all the way up!   My conference in Erie was pretty much uneventful.  I did spend quite a lot of time catching up with my high school music teachers.  They are as insane as I am!  Must be a musician thing.  I did manage to get scrambled brain on the TURBULENT flight to Erie.  No one should ever have to visit that city, for any reason, EVER!
Waiting for the other foot to fall...   Did you ever have one of those days when everything feels like it’s going so well, but a disaster seems imminent? That’s kind of how I feel right now. The weather is beautiful, things are great in school/work, I have an amazing boyfriend, life, in general right now, makes me smile. I know, collective gasp at Dave smiling at something other than the misfortunes of others! I guess when one has had so many negative life experiences and just a general lack of self-confidence, the days of sunshine and lollipops are harder to appreciate.   I'm sure I'm making little sense to you right now, but amazingly I know exactly what I'm taking about. I don't believe I'm going to say this- something my evil, gnome-like, zero personality accompanist said to me tonight actually made sense (please don't tell her I ever said that!). She said, "Stop worrying about the past, worry about the present." That's exactly what I'm going to do (or at least try really hard to do). Right now everything is sunshine and lollipops. I'm going to enjoy the weather and the treats. I'll deal with the tornado and brussel sprouts when they get dished up!   I'm going to be away for a few days now, staring at a big ass lake in Erie. I'll tell you about my trip when I get back this weekend.    Tanning update- well on my way to Puerto Rican :-)
Spruce Street Singers...  I am the Accompanist for a gay men's singing group in Philly- www.sprucestreetsingers.com.  Comprised of a great bunch of guys, albeit scary in some instances, we perform music as diverse as the membership.  Today we sang at a birthday party/benefit at Tavern on Camac, my favorite bar in the city.  We sang "gay anthems" such as  Chapel of Love ,  Somewhere Over the Rainbow ,  Do You Believe in Magic? , and  Fire Island Baby  (I'll post the lyrics for that song later).  After our performance, I played through some other Broadway songs- group numbers and some solos.  I can totally see myself as a piano bar performer at some point in the future.  Someday :-)  Time to get ready for another week of school- only two days though, as I'll be at a music conference in Erie, Pa later in the week.
The 8th Grade Team sucks goat balls...   Some teachers need a reality check. Math, Social Studies, and Language Arts are not the only subjects in the Public School System.  This team of teachers, frequently referred to as the assholes, mother fuckers, or wastes of space feel the need to keep my 8th grade chorus members in class during their SCHEDULED chorus lessons.  Furthermore, the bastard humans keep them during the Activity Period which was specifically designed for full chorus and band rehearsals.  Since my principal is a ball-less wonder, I am left to rectify this problem myself.  Some people really need to get over themselves!  Other than the chorus mess, today went pretty well.  It is a beautiful day finally!  I went tanning for the first time today (fake and bake of course) which makes me feel so calm and relaxed.  Last year I was able to tan during my lunch period.  N
