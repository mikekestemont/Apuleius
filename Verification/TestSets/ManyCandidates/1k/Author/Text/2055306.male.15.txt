stevie, you are the man. admitting to sin is the hardest part. adn amy and i were stupid too, i gave into my flesh every time i was around her. even the night b4 we moved. yeah. we always said that we would never kiss until we got married. well that changed. we weren't even going out. she had dumped me a year ago, but yeah, the night b4 we left, she kissed me a little bit and that turned into me kissing her alot bit. not good. anywho, i can wish i didn't but let's face it, that gets you no where. but god forgives, hence, what i did wrong in the past is irrelevant to my present as well as my future. i will no longer live in regret of past sins, for i embrace forgiveness, and shall go, and sin no more. now the question is, will you???  greater things than me, you shall do. jesus told us that, but when was the last time you saw a normal christian go over to that one dying dude and tell him to get out of his hospital bed???? i ain't talkin' bout benny hinn here y'all, i'm talking  'bout you an' me. i'm talking about the holy spirit and the gifts thereof.  actually, i'm really speaking it like disciple: god i come before you, to worship and adore you, i pray to see your power, holy spirit fall upon me.(insert heavy metal and screaming there)  the thing i like about christian metal and gangsta rap is they're straight up for reals. i don't like rap, but i respect them because they stay true. none of those types of music put on a facade. they aren't there to make money, they make their music to make a point.  i flow from topic to topic without problem, had you noticed???  anywho, one other thing y'all, stevie and i aren't talkin' sex when we refer to our sin or our fleshly desires. it's all up that ally with the lust of flesh but yeah, as far as i know we're all virgins here.  no lukewarm christians here. if there was, i'd be getting thrown out. actually, if this was a lukewarm blog, i would leave.  when it comes to god, it's all or nothing.   you know, when it comes to christians, we think we are so good. what idiots. we think that if we talk to nerdy geek in the corner of the cafeteria then we're all witnessers of holiness. how many of you know the preppy cheer squad needs saved too??? do not limit oyur ministry to outkasts, love all, few will reject you if you are pure and steadfast and upright. if you could gain the respect of everyone in skool because of who you were, instead of just showing kindness to quincy in calculas, you would be slightly more effective, wouldn't you be???  don't listen to what i say and do it. the spirit leads, so follow him. i just say what i know. if i'm wrong, let me know.  I message, written in rhyme, prophetic  Teachers amongst the skeptics and guiding the misdirected  Infected with their lies and their alibis  With their third eye blind, out of line, they try to prophesy  I and I unfold the mysteries told  From the futuristic realms to the days of old  Make straight through the path of the one voice calling  Truth shines, back again two times in the Second Coming    I am the Messenjah  I am the Messenjah  I am the Messenjah  I am the Messenjah    This I pledge, and I'll take it to my death  I'll lay my life down for you and die over again  I and I, I'm not ashamed of the Most High  Even if I die tonight, if I die tonight  This I pledge, and I'll take it to my death  You can bet your life on my words and everything I said  You can't take away my love for this sacrifice  Even if I die tonight, if I die tonight   True king descendant, master to the apprentice  Pleased to release and reveal in me His presence  Forever blessed, I believe if Jah said it  The word of life came alive in the scriptures I read it  All hail, we prevail, the Tribes of Israel, flow through ya  We pursue the conquering lion of the Tribe of Judah  Don't let 'em fool ya, before this, the foolish get rushed  So don't slop, you never knew us  I am the Messanjah
OK i guess i did say somethin
Ok on this whole Girlfriend boyfriend Im not sayin nothing because after all I have a girlfriend and i dont want to put down my relationship. I mean sometimes I have to for various reasons. One good thing about Isaiah and Nikita moving away it gave me more time to search after God. when Nikita was still here we were both trying to go after God with all that we had, but so much of our love was aimed at each other. I mean we would do stupid stuff that we both knew we shouldnt do but you know you are never thinking about the consequence of your actions until its over and by then you have already done the sinning. But yeah we have done stuff that we are ashamed of and for me and her we would both take back doing it but we cant. for me though there was one night in our relationship when things were perfect. We were doing our usuall stuff that we shouldnt be and then Bailey came in. that was a gift from God. we both had to stop and by the time that Bailey left we felt like crap for doing what we did. So we started talking and reading the Bible. That was like 2 weeks before Nikita moved. She gave me divotional books to read and we talked about God our relationship and she was telling me everything that i needed to hear about how God had put u
