Love-->I hate It  Why do I fall for it everything? Why do I seem to care? Why do I seem to lose my mind? Now love's an empty chair.  Once I heard all the lies, I seemed to be complete. I'm sick and tired of cries, I'm sick and tired of defeat.  I refuse to fall in love now, And now I refuse to cry. I refuse to think of somway, somehow I could believe in you lies.  Never again will I get my hopes high, Never again will I wait. Love used to be the only thing that mattered, Now it's the only thing I hate.
I reallly am an idiot.        &nbsp;   When I say I love soembody like on the second day after I know then what I actually am in love with. I am in love with the idea of love. I fall in love with the idea of lying down and having somebody to think about and have them also think about you. I fall in love with the idea of always having somebody there for you to hold and to kiss and to love you forever. But it's not love--it's the idea of it--that's why I fall so fast. I find myself very mental. I fall in love with the idea of love--I say things&nbsp;I don't even mean--I lose all the time and then it comes back again to bite me in the ass. I dont even know why I bother anymore. So I guess from this day forward I am promissing myself never to get hurt again, to protect my heart and to not let myslef fall in love or in love with the idea or whatever you want to call it. The reason is because even though I am slowly trying to recover from the death of a guy that I honestly did love with every ounce of my heart and soul---I don't want to feel like that again. With him it was different. I was never in love with the idea of love with him. I was in love with him. His eyes, his heart, his mind. Everything that he did I loved, because I loved him. I never want to feel like this ever again (even though I feel like this 24/7). I try to act happy--and from the way&nbsp;I act you could never even tell. But whenever I am alone or I drift away from the world for a few seconds--tears form in my eyes--and in my heart.      Recently when I drifted away for a few seconds tears formed up. My friend kept asking&nbsp;me what was wrong but I just ignored it and told him that I got a mosquito in my eye. It happens to me all the time-the fact that I cannot accept to move on with my life and leave old things&nbsp;in the past. But&nbsp;for me the past makes my future. And without him there is no future for me. Death to me is a really funny thing. Because it makes you realize the small things around you. Like now for me--no more drumming sessions with him-no more sleepovers--no more talks--no nothing....     Death makes you realize deep thigns too--like what you lost and what to make of yourself and how the hell do you recooperate form this feeling. For me I was never a fast healer. Hell I am still trying to recover from my grandparents dying (that was in november) now I get dumped on with this??? What the fuck? Why does life or god or whatever life force there is out there, always pick on me? Why Lindsay? Why Ryan? Why the girl next door?       &nbsp;   I swear if it were'nt for a talk I had with a friend one night (while watchin a really cool movie) I swear I would not be here writing this right now. So I will protect my heart--and save myself the trouble of nver falling in love again.Ever.....       &nbsp;
&nbsp;I'm flirting with suicide right now-there is no real reason for me to live anymore. I have nothing really left to live for. I stayed up till five&nbsp;in the morning with my friend trying to figure it out and&nbsp;I can't -There is no happy ending for me and the fairytale for me has turned in to&nbsp; a horror movie. &nbsp; I can't get over small things. People keep telling me that the small things don't count but when I add them all up I see what nobody else can see. I see a giant problem and the problem for me at the moment is living. I'm not trying to figure out the meaning of life--I'm trying to figure out the meaning of MY life. Also for some reason everytime I try to put the pieces back togeather it always falls apart a billion times worse again. It makes me frustrated and I tend to give up---all the time and I want to give up again-this time for good. &nbsp; Maybe I just want to get away from the love I get that always seems to shatter or maybe I want to get away from all the people I know and all the things I do. I mean what's the point of living if everybody I love dies or leaves me. Love hurts, people die, friendships crumble, people move away, fights. Nothing seems to matter to me anymore. I don't care. I honestly feel like I have no reason to put myself through all this pain-I have too much of it to handle. I'm not a very open person either-i don't like it when people know how&nbsp;I fell about myself or about others-because I always get hurt in the end. There is honestly no reason to go on. Who do I have to live for? Nobody.Nothing. Nobody because all the people I have ever loved has left me or killed themselves or died. &nbsp; Sure, people are going to try to tell me what I have to live for but I have finally figured what I have left to live for-nothing. Nothing because t
