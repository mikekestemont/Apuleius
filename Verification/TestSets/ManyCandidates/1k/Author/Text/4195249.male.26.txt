One thing that is becoming a common sight in New York City, my home town, is a group of right-wing Christians preaching hate that is rooted in their interpretation of the Bible. These are the men commonly referred to as "the Black Israelites," the most prominent groups being the 12 Tribes, and the Israelite Church of Universal Practical Knowledge (UPK). These men teach an absurd form of right-wing Christianity that comes off as the Black Nationalist version of the Christian Identity movement.   Their doctrine, at its most basic level, is a spin on the Bible, where the Israelites are the ancestors of modern day African and Latino Americans. These are the chosen people of God, and the other nations are cursed. The main enemy are the Edomites, whom these groups argue are the people today referred to as "white." This quick look into their various cults will show the idiocy behind these claims, and expose these alleged "prophets" as being men who are not at all acquainted with the text they claim to follow (i.e. the Bible).   The claim that the modern day so-called "white man" is Esau is derived from specific interpretions of Obadiah, and other books of the Bible, but rests most strongly on Genesis 25:25. This verse informs us that Esau was "red" at birth, and based on this, the Black Israelite groups conclude that Esau, one of the most hated characters of the Biblical folklore, is the progenitor of caucasians. "The 'white' man isn't really white" they scream. "He's red!" The blood shows through the skin, due to lack of melanin, and thus they have proven Esau was the first white man.   This is the crux of their argument, and like many of their claims, it exposes them as complete novices with regard to Hebrew and the Bible. Indeed, in Genesis 25:25, Esau is referred to as "red," and the word "red" was translated from is the following:      Of course, the 12 Tribers and the UPKers don't know Hebrew, so they don't know this. In fact, they try to down play their inability to speak the original language that their folklore was recorded in by claiming that modern Hebrew is really Yiddish; they have created their own dialect, "Lashawan Kadash," which is a play on the Hebrew "Lashon Kodesh" (Holy Tongue). Rather than referring to the Hebrew text, they rely solely on the King James translation of the Christian scriptures.   Regardless, these monolingual bible thumpers shoot themselves in the foot when they claim that Genesis 25:25 is proof that Esau was white. Elsewhere in their rhetoric, they go on to claim that the tribe of Judah of the Biblical folklore was made up of what are now referred to as "African Americans," or "black" people. Unfortunately, these men don't realize that one of the kings of Judah is also described in the same way that Esau is described in the aforementioned verse from Genesis.   As has already been stated, the Hebrew word that "red," in Genesis 25:25, was translated from is admonee. As any Rabbi will tell you, there is only one other person in the Bible that is described as being admonee (red, ruddy), and that is King David. I will now compare the Hebrew text of 1 Samuel 16:12, and Genesis 25:25.   Genesis 25:25     VaYetse harishon ADMONEE khulo, K'aderet se'ar, va'iqro sh'mo Esav.   "And the first came out RED [admonee], all over like a hairy garment; and they called his name Esau."   1 Samuel 16:12     Va'ishlach vaivi'ehu V'hu ADMONEE im-Y'feh einayim V'tov ro'ee Vayomer YHWH qum M'shachehu ki-zeh hu.   "And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was RUDDY [admonee], and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he."   Now, this proves, beyond a doubt, that the same word is used to describe both Esau and David. The 12tribers and the UPKers may attempt to erect a strawman by ridiculing my transliteration, insinuating that I used a "Yiddish pronunciation," but the text still tells the story. Even if they resort to their "Lashawan Kadash" dialect, both men are described with the same word (in this case, pronounced ahdamawanaya, rather than admonee). David is "ahdamawanaya", and Esau is "ahdamawanaya" as well. Both the 12tribers and the UPKers have tried to escape this fact by staying only with the KJV translation, saying that David was ruddy, and Esau red, and that these are two different descriptions (they claim "ruddy" means young). However, there is no escaping the Hebrew text.   With regard to "Lashawan Kadash," the Black Israelites have created their own dialect, where the only vowels are 'a' (as in "raw") or 'i' (as in "high"), the 'i' sound being derived from ayin, and all other letters taking the 'a' sound. This absurd "Lashawan Kadash" dialect actually hurts the Black Israelites when we consider the name "Adam," which in Hebrew is written the following way:      This word, devoid of its vowels, actually appears in the Hebrew text of the TaNaKh on several occasions meaning "red." In those instances, Hebrew speakers would pronounce it adom, or adum. However, in "Lashawan Kadash" there are no vowels (the pointed text is ignored), and those words have to be pronounced as adam. The first example would be the Hebrew text of Isaiah 63:2. I challenge the Black Israelites to refer to the Hebrew text of Isaiah 63:2, and tell me what word "red" is translated from (in Hebrew, it would be adom, but because of the particular spelling, where the vav is dropped, it is pronounced adam in "Lashawan Kadash"). Here is the Hebrew text:   Isaiah 63:2     One final example is in order to put this nonsense to rest. The Freethought Mecca would like to present the Hebrew text of Zechariah 1:8, which, on two occasions, mentions horses that are red. To help our non Hebrew speakers, we would like to show some of the words. The Hebrew word for horse is soos, and it is written as follows:      Now, on the second line of the t
