Welcome Sarah!  I look forward to all the adventures we will share.  Oh and Jen I'm kidding about the dishes.  Love you guys.
What up girls!! It's your home dawg Sarah!  Can't wait to chat and discuss interesting topics...whatever they might be.  Peace out.
Jen doesn't do her dishes!
Amanda is mean to her sim.
I hope this turns out well.
Well lookie here - its PINK!! and I added the comments option.  humm
Hi, y'all!  I'm trying this out!  How does it look?
Its looming. We've kinda played with this site (and tinkered with the layout) but the dispersement that caused its creation is coming and ever sooner. My room is full of boxes, half of my roommates stuff is already gone, Kim's had her garage sale and is also living among boxes, I have an application for Harding that I need to get off and in the mail (yes I am about to work on an MDiv). The leases are up the end of the month. Its an awkard thing to be remaining here longer than most of the others (I'm glad you will be here this summer Sarah!).   I need to work on fundraising, move my stuff into Edwards, see Kill Bill I (if i am going to see KB2 with the rest of 'em), and who knows what else. On a way exciting note I found enough little stickers to fill my subway card so I get to sit here with Amanda and Sarah watching the Return of the King and eating a free subway wrap (and not thinking about what else I should be doin)!
I miss you all already.  Kim and Amanda how are you doing?  Reading Amanda's blog, it sounds like she is taking it easy.  That's great.  Give yourself some free time.  You both definitely deserve it.  We all do.  It is so weird, everyone going in their separate directions.  I did this several years ago, saying good-bye to friends, and now I am doing it all over again - having to start from scratch to find new friends to hang out with.  I am still trying to finish up Harry Potter, but I think Jen is going to be mad b/c I won't have them finished by this weekend.  Another kink in the matter is I am doing a Middle School retreat this weekend, so I don't know if I will have time to go.  So Jen, I think you should go without me.  If Kim or Amanda were still here they would go with you.  Sorry I am not as good of friends as them. :)  I really do miss you all and can't wait to hear from you, especially what the Lord is doing in your lives.  Talk to you soon.  Blessings and Peace.
i love you. i miss you. i am exhausted. hope you enjoyed the movie. sarah which book are you in now?
There isn't much here, I guess we are all busy.  I'm currently semi-helping TeamKids Wednesday nights at church.  Just wanted to update this blog, it's getting a little sad.
Today I attended a Lutheran service for the first time ever.  Of course it was different than my CoC tradition but I was not totally lost thanks to the worship class I class I took.  I felt it important to experience other worship services and not just talk or learn about them.  I have to say I did like it.    There was one part I did not expect but I liked it alot.  There was a time in the service where we shared peace.  Members exchanged "peace to you" or "Peace to God."  And that brought a smile to me.  There was something about saying and recieving peace.  For me at least it allowed me to become a part of a whole and not just a separate piece.    So, I say to you "Peace be with you."
I've decided to relocate my blog.  I figured most of my other fellow friends and bloggers use the place I thought I'd join to.
I did it. I made myself watch John Kerry's whole speech. I did watch John Edwards speech but I was also switching it with Newlyweds so I didn't see the whole speech. Yes, it was a well delivered speech but I was not inspired. I guess because I was fed the usual of what politicians say to get your vote. It will be interesting to see Bush's speech and see if he responds to Kerry's criticism.  I've decided to pay attention to the race this year because I am undecided, I don't even have party on my registration card anymore. So, I guess I'm in the swing vote category but I don't think it will make much difference here in Texas but I will vote none the less.  Actually by being undecided I've stirred some controversy in my family, which I like to do every now and then. I have certain relatives who don't think you can be democrats and a Christian at the same time. (FYI I don't believe that and I am not a democrat)  I wish I had something else to write on other than the DNC.
I feel so much relief now.&nbsp; I have completed all my assignments for my last class and I will graduate a week from Friday.&nbsp; In one sense I am so happy to be done but in another I am a bit sad about not being in school anymore.&nbsp; It has been such a transforming period of my life, actually it basically has been my life.&nbsp; Now I must step out of the academic world and step into the real world and I'm scared to death!
This morning&nbsp; I decided to go to a local community church.&nbsp; It is a large church with about 1,000 in attendance at the service. &nbsp; Once I arrived I entered the building and proceeded to walk inside the worship center when something I spotted made me immediately think, 'Why in God's name is there a 20ft heigh and 8ft wide model of DNA?!'&nbsp; I thought surely there is going to be some kind of e
