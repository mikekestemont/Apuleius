Hey this is a little American girl in the midwest and I would like to say this: yeah...i have my pajamas on and my hair has soda in it...but other than that still looking the same
Saturday  Just a normal day in a german soccer fan's life. I am sitting here watching TV (my favorite soccr team) and just talking to some people on msn.  My soccer team is winning right now-just the way it should be- and so i am really happy right now. I am also talking to this american gal, i dont wanna say names. And i am really happy....soccer team scored again. Now it is 3-0 and i am really happy about that.  Today was a really crappy day outside as it was raining all day long and i was just lying on my bed watching TV and eating. I think i will get fat again as there is nothing to do.
is this me???? I know I shouldn't sound like that, but I do...so I'm just going to let you know...I'm here no matter what...just don't worry about anything.   I'm just worried about stuff right now.   Something came over me to be able to blog on Stefan's blog...I mean I love it to death...I get to have the power to put my own thoughts on his blog [hehehe...joke.] must go..  later taters  holliejo  lovelots  holliejo  got some questions stefan...send me an e.mail... [please and thanks]
Well it is really boring. I got so many channels in my TV and satellite and I don't care about any of the movies that are on.  What a sick day. None of the movies I have ever heard of and the only thing that I stop at is the soccer channel with games that I saw about a million times already. Why don't these Hollywood buttheads tape their movies faster so that there is more good stuff to watch on TV. So the only thing i am doing apart from zapping right now is talking to some people from back over at the midwest and the person i am really waiting for aint coming on and i sure hope that that person will come on really quick. I know it is early but i am already really tired. Watching TV and eating the whole day makes everyone really tired. But on the other hand i am on break, so i can sleep tommorrow :-) For now i am still hoping for that person to come online and then we will see!
Hey Everyone  Just woke up on a crappy sunday morning. It is raining it is too early to do anything but watch TV and eat. As i am just the only one thats awake at this time it sucks too, because i would love to just run thorugh the house yelling, just for the sake of yelling. Well  i hope that everybody in the midwest gets some good night of sleep and for now that was ME with a few words of wisdom. GOOD NIGHT (?or are you already sleeping?)
I made you an administrator. So now you can also change some stuff if you would like to.:-)  Good morning/ good night  It is about nine in the morning and i just got up so i can barely hold my eyes open but i am trying hard. I got myself out of bed that early because i was kinda hoping that holliejo would still be on but she aint. Thats alright i guess because she wrote in the blog.  First things first. I wont get together with that girlfriend again. I thought about that last night and i figured that it just wouldnt be right and so i am not gonna be with that girl anymore/never ever again. I dont know if that makes hollie happy but it sure makes me happy because no i can worry about other things and dont have to think about my lousy relationship with that girl. For the next months you can also be sure that i wont get a gf.So nothingto worry about and if holliejo finds someone that perfectly fits to her she can always tell me because i will be really happy for her. Because hollie needs a guy that stays with her no matter what, that can deal with her time to time attitude problems and crazyness, and can handle all the power that shes got. I know this sounds really hard, but someone that will really love her will be able to handle all those problems and still be able to smile all the time just like hollie herself. WEll i kinda gotta get some breakfast in so i wish you all a good night and take care until the morning.  Lovelots German
Hey....I need to talk to Stefan about getting all the coments and stuff thing up...and then I don't have a title bar thingy so I can't really put in a title...so that sucks   How Do I Do This Without Hurting Him...No Not You Stefan :D   This shout out...or thank you...just prefer to be dorky right about now...anyway...so Stefan is great...he doesn't think he is...but whatever...he doesn't know what he is talking about...cuz he's German...and that explains a lot of things...well...Stefan is great...he really is...I mean from the last what?? year or so..we've gotten so close and that totally rocks becuase I never thought that we could ever be so close...so that means that I could tell him anything and know that he would help me find the right path to go down...because well...I seem to get lost really easy...it's just one thing...but Stefan he helps me down the right path and makes sure I run...by threatening me with a volleyball...he's great...you know...just great...he's helped me a lot of times and I wished that I could just help him as much as he helps me...because that is what friends are for.  I'm prutty proud of what we have done...just becasue how many people can make a friendship out of something that wasn't there before he left to go half way across t
