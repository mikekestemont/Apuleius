...that don't even bother to do something about it.  The last couple of days i've listened to a couple of people here at work and some friends bitch and complain about the government and the state of affairs in this country.  Those same people have made it clear they're not going to vote on June 28th because they "don't care".  Holy Christ!!!  Now there's some intelligence for ya.  I told one person to downright grow the f*ck up.  You're a Canadian adult, it's your right to vote and your duty to help get this country out of the shithole it's in right now.  I've always voted Liberal.  I'm not sure I have many liberal ideologies anymore and it all comes down to one simple fact.  The Liberals currently in power need to go, and someday there will be new faces in the party who don't have their heads up their asses and then it will be time to bring the Liberals back.  I'm going to be voting Conservative.  Dare I say that once I see the way things are going I may become a hardcore conservative.  If you don't know anything about politics then here's all you need to know...  On June 28th, go vote Conservative.  Things in this country will get better.  Learn to look out for yourselves.  Don't buy in to sap stories on the news that bleed the country of millions of dollars.   TGIF!
I'm sitting here looking at the clear blue sky then glancing back at the weather forecast that calls for rain this morning, blue sky, then back to the weather forecast.  F*ck me, i'm in the wrong line of work!  I should be a weatherman.  I mean come on, it's a job where you're wrong 80% of the time and you don't get fired.  If I was a weatherman, there would be no bullshit.  Forecast will only really vary with the seasons...  Spring/Summer: Today's forecast:  If you look up and it's clear skies, it's gonna be sunny.  Wear sunscreen so you don't burn, jackass.  If you look up and there are clouds, then it's gonna be cloudy or cloudy and sunny.  If at some point those clouds turn grey, it's gonna rain.  If those clouds are really dark, it's gonna piss rain.  Fall: Today's forecast:  If you look up and it's clear skies, it's gonna be sunny but probably cold because f*cking winter is just around the corner.  If you look up and it's not clear skies, then just stay inside and cover the windows.  You don't want to be in or see the shit that will be going on outside.  Winter: Todays's forecast:  It's gonna be f*cking cold.  Even if it's clear skies, snow will probably sneak up on us at any moment and add shit to shit that's already shit.  You'll likely slip somewhere today and break something.  Take a leave of abscence from your job and go back to work in the Spring.   Ok, i'm done venting.  Sarcasm is the best medicine.  Steve's is open past 5:30 today so I can go pickup a pack of Elixr strings for my guitar.  F*cking figures, I go there last Friday to get a pack just because I felt like changing them before I ran into problems and they didn't have any mediums left; on Tuesday I broke my D string (what are the odds).  I swear to God if I go there and they don't have any mediums left, there's gonna be some commotion.  One of the best known stores in Ontario and they run out of Elixr strings, Jesus.  It's the same as a car dealer saying, "Um sorry, we don't have any cars on the lot right now". FYI, Elixr guitar strings are the "cat's ass" of guitar strings.  Once you try them, you realize there's nothing better and you've spent years wasting your money on a shitty brand that gives you a cool sticker in every pack *cough* Dean Markley Blue Steel *cough*.  Well, time to finish up some crap here at work and then i'll spend my time until 8am productively by reading for my IID course.  P.S. F*ck the weathermen, "F*ck them up their stupid asses"

Just finished playing Molly Maid.  Jen went lilac crazy over the weekend and although those things smell nice, when they start to die they have a smell that just gets to me.  More BBQ tonight; beef tournados and damn they were good.  Still getting used to the cooking times on this BBQ though.  Seems like I gotta cook everything on low but i'm not sure low is really low.  Seems more like it has two settings, hot and hotter.  Oh well, it was free from my dad and it's a kickass BBQ so I won't complain too much.  I watched American Idol tonight although that type of competition doesn't interest me much.  From what I saw, one girl was a spinoff of Macey Gray and the other was another version of Hilary Duff meets Mandy Moore.  They need to get away from the pop and mix it up with some rock.  American Idol with bands competing would be much more entertaining.  Oh goodie f*cking gumdrops, look at the time.  Gotta get ready for work.  On another sour note, i'm seriously starting to get pissed at my IID prof.  The guy can't give a straight answer and i'm starting to wonder if he's a descendant of Apelonia.  And on that note, cue the music.
Just got up, stumbled into the living room and what do I see?  A huge plant pot we have filled to the rim with water.  I ain't no plant expert but I do know what too much water looks like.  Oh well, that plant takes up too much room, I hope it drowns.  Well slap me in the ass and call me Suzie; my IID professor F
