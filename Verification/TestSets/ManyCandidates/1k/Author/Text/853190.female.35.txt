Let me just start by saying that I am officially on vacation.  What's that, you ask? I'm not sure, but ask me in two weeks and if I have figured it out, I'll let you know.  In truth, it's impossible for an attorney who is running her own firm to truly take two weeks off without any contact with the office whatsoever, but if my staff (who is absolutely awesome, I must say) can keep the office running to the point where we only communicate by email at the end of each day, I'll consider it a successful two weeks. :)          I'm learning that some clients have unrealistic expectations of what a lawyer is and isn't, so I thought I'd take this opportunity to give the general public some tips on who we are, what to expect from us, and what YOU need to do to ensure a smooth, positive working relationship. (By now you're probably thinking " What do you mean 'what *I* need to do?  I'm paying you to do things for me, not the other way around!")  Ummm...yeah, but if YOU fail to do a few things to make MY job easier, we BOTH get screwed.  So, pay attention. :)          1.  Attorneys are human beings, too!  Believe it or not, we laugh, we cry, and most of us really care about our clients.   We make the best decisions we can based on the information that you give us, and on whatever evidence we get our hands on.  We CANNOT guarantee results, as we are not only at the mercy of the law, but we're at the mercy of the mood of the judge. :)            2.  When you hire an attorney, you are an integral part of the Attorney-Client relationship.  You are protected by the Attorney-Client Privilege, which means that I cannot tell the other side ANYTHING you tell me that is not discoverable through some other method.  That means that if you're being sued for adultery and you confide in me that you did it, but they have NO evidence, then you're home free, because I can't tell on you!  So, guess what that means?  TELL ME EVERYTHING- the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth!  Do NOT guess, and do NOT withhold information, because if you do, I cannot protect you if the other side finds out the truth and then slaps us with it in court.  If I know the whole story, I can prepare for any scenario.  Your duty as a client is to divulge anything and everything that could affect the outcome of your case.          3.  Attorneys do not control how fast a case moves through the system, especially if it will definitely end up going to trial.  We can do our best to request trial dates and hearings, but we are ultimately at the mercy of the court coordinator.  Remember that the courts are backlogged with cases, and try not to yell at your attorney too much when it takes her three months to get a date for a trial setting!          4.  Your case is not the only case your attorney has.  Your attorney has to work their caseload in accordance with what has been scheduled by the courts and what deadlines are looming.  They will not touch your case every day, and they will not call you every day to give you an update.  Attorneys are very busy, and if you don't hear from your attorney for two weeks, that usually means that nothing has happened with your case that needs to be reported to you.  That doesn't mean they haven't looked at it at all, it just means that there is nothing new to report.  Attorneys charge for their time- if you call them every day to request the status of your case, you're going to have one really big bill, because thay are going to charge you for our time.  Please realize that your Attorney is working for you and doing their best.  Calling your Attorney once every two weeks to check the status is okay, but any more than that isn't necessary.  Trust me, we haven't forgotten you. :)          5.  Please pay your bills on time, and if a lump sum is due that you can't afford, then call and work out a payment arrangement and stick to it!  Attorneys have bills to pay, too...we have to pay our staff, our rent, your filing fees, our utilities and phone, etc., and if you don't pay your bills, we can't pay ours...and we'll most likely withdraw from your case. :)          Hopefully, this little semi-rant will give you a little insight as to how you can make your experience with an Attorney a positive one.  And, I'll post more tips as they come to me, but right now it's time for VACATION!!!!
Welcome to the Lamenting Lawyer!&nbsp; This will be a plethora of musings, articles, and rantings regarding the legal profession.&nbsp; Grab some java, get comfy, and get an inside look at the wonderful world of lawyers. :)     &nbsp;    DISCLAIMER: Nothing in this blog will constitute legal advice, and absolutely NO ATTORNEY CLIENT relationship exists between myself and anyone who reads this unless there is a signed, written contract of employment executed in my office.&nbsp; ALL CONTENTS OF THIS PAGE ARE COPYRIGHTED BY ME UNLESS STATED OTHERWISE, so please ask permission before republishing.&nbsp; Thanks! :)
Let me preface this whole rant by stating what may not be obvious...I'm NOT a Texan. :) I know, I know, I'm scum, I'm a blashphemer, whatever you want to call me.  And, before you ask WHY I'm in Texas, I'll just spill the goods.  I'm a native Louisianan, and let's just say I ended up here in humid Texas because at least the laws here are in a language most people can understand...of course the logic might be WAY twisted, but it's readable. :)Also, you can blame my presence here on my husband- he thinks that anyone north of I-10 is a "Damn Yankee." :)      Today, I'm going to rant a bit about what I
