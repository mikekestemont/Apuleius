Fotos in the past..... in Paris 2002     Been busy copying some of my scanned pics into the new laptop. (The laptop is doing GREAT *so far* by the way, no more of those scary symptoms!  Uiteindelijk !) Ohh, that reminds me too, to ask Dutchman a favor to scan our other holiday fotos...      Anyways, I got so hyped up seeing our Paris trip 2 years ago, Dutchman's gift to me for visiting him in NL. I knew we will be staying there for a week... but when I asked him how much my share was for the trip, he grinned and said, "  Its my gift to you baby!  ". I guess that was kind of romantic at that time since I didn't get any flowers!!! You know Dutch-MEN, they fall behind the romance department but this was indeed plus points! Doncha agree?          Crimee Metro Station          A candid shot! Didn't expect Dutchman will flash away!   I love the bright yellow color of the underground channel, kind of warm but sexy.         Cafe in Montmartre          Located on the same hill where Sacre Coeur church is sitting. Dutchman and I were kind of arguing if we would like to have a foto in this cafe. I insisted, hehe. So when we got the bill, we asked the waiter to do it!   I think he did a fantastic job!           Eiffel Tower in the Evening!        See the lighted Tower on top of my head. The lights go blinking for several minutes every hour. Beautiful, it looks like an inverted Christmas tree at night! Haha! Best place to view it from afar would be in Montparnasse building.         At the  Train Cabin restaurant.        That place was actually charming but heck, it was too small, even for me!        Sacre Coeur        Stairs going down to the street from the church... w/   Paris view in the background. Can you imagine going up and down with my heels!? March weather wasn't that great too, hence my umbrella!            Montmartre Square  with the Painters.    I tell you, the painters in this square should be sent to court for harrassment! They behave in fact like glorified beggars begging to paint or make a sketch of you for a fee. I had to hide behind Dutchman's butt! ---But, I couldn't pass the opportunity not posing in the square with these talented species and their art as my backdrop!
The Gothic Cathedral     The history of Utrecht began where the church stands today. At the beginning of our era, the Romans built a fort here, the remains of which still lie under the Domsquare today. The first Saint Martin’s church was built on this location in the 7th century.    From Roman to Gothic  The predecessor of the current church dates fromthe start of the 11th century. Some remnants of this Roman Saint Martin’s cathedral can be seen in the garden beside the Domtower. In 1253, a huge fire swept through the city and badly damaged the Roman cathedral. A new architectural style, Gothic, was chosen for rebuilding the church. Construction of this Gothic Saint Martin’s church began in 1254, when Bishop Hendrik van Vianden laid the first stone. Bit by bit, the originally Roman cathedral was replaced.    urlLink      The DOM in Utrecht     1254  - Bishop Hendrik van Vianden laid the first stone of the Gothic Cathedral.    1320  - Construction of the tower began.  1500  - Tower and church were connected.    1520  - Construction of the cathedral ended.    1 August 1674  - Utrecht was ravaged by a tornado. The cathedral nave collapsed.    1826  - The rubble was finally cleared away, the current Domsquare was created.    1901 to 1931  - The reception building in front of the cathedral tower was built.    2004  - The nave rises again!
Saturday is shopping day at our favorite cheap-y grocery store,   urlLink Nettorama  . Dutchman calls it, “ The poor people’s supermarket ”. He’s eccentric; he is fond of altering defined subjects that he fancies on.  The   urlLink Consumentenbond   (Consumer organization) have rated them as the #1 supermarket with the cheapest prices in the whole of NL. The low-cost German   urlLink ALDI   and   urlLink LIDL   ranked next.  Its just 10 minutes bike ride from where we live, which makes it very convenient for us. I kind of liked it since it gives my legs the needed exercise for the weekend. I have a  fiets tas  (bike bag) that hangs at the back of my bike. Sister in law gave this to me, very useful when we go shopping.       WAIT...... did I just say we shop with our bikes?  WHY  the heck are you shocked? Hehe - I myself still can't get over the idea. It's kind of kiddy-stuff. Well that was how I see it before, I thought biking is akin to playing.... but not here in NL!         If you don't have a bike ,  then you don’t live in NL  . That simple! Later I will edit this entry and post a foto of a Dutch going shopping with this ubiquitous bike.      Studies here show that a Dutch person has on average 2 bikes.  The 1st bike is a “ beat down bike ”, for practical reasons against bike-napping, the country’s # 1 crime. These bikes are the ones you artfully evade when crossing the streets in the Centrum. The nice thing is... you actually hear the rickety subjects from a distance. They make their arrival known so that gives you ample time to jump to the gutter!  The 2nd bike, a “ nice good priced bike ”, for personal enjoyment… and must by all means never be detached from the owner. Alright I am exaggerating! If you choose to let’s say leave it somewhere, then do NOT, I repeat do NOT forget to padlock the poor thing twice, some in fact do it thrice! Talk about being SIGURISTA! And a reminder, you are stupid if you leave it in a non-paid  fietsen stallen  (bike parking)! Consider yourself warned.  Great, I have finished my bike rant and now I will go shopping :-)   HP/Microsoft Update : The Laptop is again working  OK  but in a
