I have recieved the highest honor a blogger could ask for:  recognition by another blogger via a link to my blog on theirs.  Friend, reader, and fellow blogger: I THANK YOU.     I tried responding in kind, but I don't know how to add a links portion to my blog yet.  As soon as I do, I'll list all the blogs I enjoy plus some other cool stuff.   oh, and there's one who is not ready for her blog to become quite so public, so I won't link it here until she gives me the OK.   YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE!     Rain, rain, rain again today.  I like rain, had to work in it all morning and was soaked to my skivvies by 10 am, but kept my spirits up by singing the saturday night bath song ("splish splash, I was takin' a bath....") and by realizing there wasn't a thing I could do about it until we finished and I had time to change.     And big news!   Our first chick has pipped!  It's to be delivered to its new parents this afternoon, since the hatcher is just a machine and doesn't make for very good parenting.  Several of our future chicks will be hand-reared, but we're all very excited, and I'm sure Berta and Ernie, one of our sandhill pairs and soon-to-be-parents, will do a bang-up job.  It'll help that it's not their first time.  I may explain more about how we go about hatching and raising chicks later, but I don't want to post too much work-related stuff in order to protect myself, my co-workers, and the Foundation.  I don't think I've said anything yet that one couldn't find out by visiting and taking a tour, but just in case.    SO....back to Freud and Lewis.  Despite copious note taking, I really can't do  The Question Of God  justice here without much longer entries and time commitments that I can't make at present, so if anything I've said interests you I urge you to read it for yourself.  On the question of conscience and the idea of a universal moral law (i.e. Natural Law, Tao, First Principles of Practical Reason, Traditional Morality, a sense of right and wrong, etc.) Freud claimed morals came from internalized rules that parents instilled, and that guilt is inherited from our primordal ancestors who killed their "totem-father"-the dominant male who controlled each people group-a theory he quickly rescinded on after publishing it.  He further stated that the scientific method is the sole road to fact-finding, and that if people were simply educated and taught that acting morally (not killing, stealing, etc.) is in their best interest, they will act accordingly (this was before the very educated Nazis tried to kill off Freud and other Jews).  He believed equating morals with religion was dangerous because as people become educated they throw off religion, and would likewise throw off morals.  However, as with every other spiritually related question addressed so far, Freud waffled continually on the subject and at times disagreed with himself entirely, but refused the alternative.      Lewis countered by stating that science was purely for observation and reporting on how things behave and/or respond, and any attempt to explain how things got the way they are or going beyond that is to make non-scientific philosophical and/or metaphysical assumptions.  He says that every culture throughout time has had the same basic set of morals and many advanced cultures had moral teachings that led them to see how alike they were to each other.  For example, double-crossing those who help you or stealing have never been admired among any people group.  AND, every people group has failed to live up to their standards (this is the clincher Lewis uses for our need of God) Instead, it is only our sensitivity to these basic morals that change.  A society like ours which has been desensitized by things like psychoanalysis that tells us that our morals are simply a function of delusion or evolution will accept degraded morals much easier.     Further, how can we judge something as "right" or "wrong" without a standard to compare it to?  Obviously we all have a sense of what the ideal right and wrong is or how would we know we're messing up?    While Freud said that trying to be good and always messing up will basically lead to depression and helplessness and a greater sense of unfulfilled longing, Lewis said the following:    "Virtue--even attempted virtue--brings light; indulgence brings fog"     Enough on those two for the day.  Next time---Hope vs. Delusion
My chronic unhappy dreams are back.  I'm reaching the end of my rope with them.  I actually got up a half hour early this morning (VERY unusual for me) just because I knew that if i went back to sleep I'd continue to be plagued by them.  But hey, it's a beautiful day, and the extra time gave me a chance to pray and prepare better for the day, which I screwed up anyway by the end of my morning meeting.  So much for a fab Friday, which is really just Thursday for me since I work Saturdays.  Yeah, are you clear on that now?  Great.  Praise God that I'm a work in progress, and His grace and providence are greater than I!!     Read the chapter about the question of an Intelligent creator with Freud and Lewis--one of the most interesting tenets of Lewis' was that all of our desires are things that can be satisfied (i.e. we hunger because there's food, we have sexual desire because there's sex, and we want to believe in God because there is a God)  Although I'm already a biased reader, my heart goes out to poor Freud, who angrily and defiantly attacked belief in God for the entirety of his life, and in many of his personal letters osciallated and spoke often of God to his friends.  While I've only finished 2 chapters I definitely reccommend this book for the interest value if nothing else.  We can learn so much from history and the magnificent people w
