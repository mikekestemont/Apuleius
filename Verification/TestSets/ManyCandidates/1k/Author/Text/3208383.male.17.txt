Damn remorseful.. if only i hadnt came out with a lame excuse.. if only i had told him the truth.. if only... too many if only to say.. too many.. yet wat will happen in the future.. he isnt gonna bother abt me.. I'm like closer to him than to anybody lor.. even my parents.. I am NOT BLAMING ANYONE FOR THIS.. just me.. can anyone tell me what can i do.. have seen him angry before.. took him like dunno how many months did he take to forgive the people who incured his wrath.. will it happen to me? or will it take longer????
