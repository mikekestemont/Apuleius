This is my reply to  urlLink this post .   1.  Tori Amos - Girl  - This song has been "my song" for about 10 years. There's been times when I've thought that I'd grown out of it, grown up, become stronger than that. But I always go back to it. I'm always in there somewhere.  She's been everybody else's girl/Maybe someday she'll be her own.   2.  Aimee Mann - Save Me  - I've been feeling this song a lot lately. Not because there's anyone in particular whom I think fits the song for me. But because I wish there was.  You look like a perfect fit/For a girl in need of a tourniquet .  3.  Alanis Morissette - Mary Jane  -  I hear you're losing weight again Mary Jane/Do you ever wonder who you're losing it for . I've never tried to lose weight - quite the opposite. But one of my sub-conscious reactions to major emotional stress is the inability to eat. And this song reminds me of those times.  4.  Dave Matthews Band  - The way things could be, or should be, even.  you came to me like wine comes to this mouth/Grown tired of water all the time/You quench my heart and you quench my mind .  5.  R.E.M. - Walk Unafraid  - We all know I am the queen of clumsy. But it's not just a physical thing... I feel clumsy emotional and other ways as well. This song has been a strengthening song for me. A mantra of sorts. Cheering myself on to be my own person.  but somewhere there I/lost my way/everyone walks the same/expecting me to step/the narrow path they've laid .  6.  Edie Brickell - Stwisted  - I guess this one barely needs an explanation.  But I keep holding on for a future/I keep looking for something that I'll never see .  7.  Depeche Mode - Just Can't Get Enough  - This reminds me of late 1999, when Scott and I were first dating.  We slip and slide as we fall in love/And I just can't seem to get enough   8.  Heather Nova - London Rain  - This goes along with the Depeche Mode song, and the way it used to feel with Scott.  and when i'm home curled in your arms and i'm safe again/i'll close my eyes and sleep to the sound of london rain .  9.  Duncan Sheik - In the Absence of Sun  - This was on a mix tape that Jenni LaVasseur made for me in 1998. And I listened to it in my car a lot. This song became important to me when Ron and I broke up. It described so much of what I was feeling. And now it's the other way around - now, I think this may be a lot of what Scott is thinking.  I don't want to feel this way/I don't want to say I'm just a friend/I don't want to wait around here/'Cause you don't want to feel no pain again/We just lie about it/As we become shadows of ourselves .  10.  Ebba Forsberg - Lost Count  - I saw this video on tv once a long, long time ago, and loved the song. Then I prompty forgot about it. Years later, I remembered it, and downloaded it. And the whole song.... I just love it. I can't pick out just a few lyrics, so.......  Been walked Out upon And been the one Walking Out On the ones I love Made my Life a mess I can't put the blame on no one but myself Lost hope and I Lost faith So many times I lost count Been stumbling Grouping Caught But found a way Out of Each And every trap Somehow And so far Made my Life a mess I can't put the blame on anyone but myself Lost hope and I Lost faith So many times I lost count I lost count... Ooh... Ooh... Ooh... Ooh... Lost hope and I Lost faith So many time I lost count Been walked Out upon And been the one Walking Out  11.  Jimi Hendrix - Little Wing  - I love it when  urlLink Pete  plays this song. It's such a beautiful song, and it always makes me think happy thoughts. And I think it's the perfect biographical song about Delirium. If I ever get my Delirium tattoo, some part of the lyrics of this song will be in it.  Well she's walking/through the clouds/with a circus mind/that's running 'round/Butterflies and zebras/and moonbeams and fairy tales/That's all she ever thinks about/Riding with the wind.   12.  Johnny Horton - The Battle of New Orleans  - My daddy used to sing this song, or we sang it together, when I was little. So it always reminds me of the happiest parts of my childhood.  In 1814, we took a little trip/along with Colonel Jackson/Down the Mighty Mississip/We took a little bacon and we took a little beans/and we caught the bloody British in the town of New Orleans.   13.  Patti Smith - Kimberly  - High school, sitting out in the grass/dandelions with my group of friends at lunch, or a free period, or skipping class.  Little sister, the sky is falling, I don't mind, I don't mind/Little sister, the fates are calling on you.   14.  Jimmy Eat World - The Middle  - Another song I use to reassure myself.  It just takes some time/Little girl you're in the middle/Of the ride/Everything, Everything will be just fine./Everything, Everything will be all right, all right   15.  The Ramones - We're a Happy Family  - I'm happy to say that my real family has nothing in common with this song. But I love it. I love the expression on my brother's face when he was singing along with it, the first time I ever heard it.  Daddy likes MEN!   16.  The Rolling Stones - She's a Rainbow  - Just such a happy-go-lucky song. It's light and sweet and has a playful piano melody that I adore.  Have you seen her dressed in blue/See the sky in front o
