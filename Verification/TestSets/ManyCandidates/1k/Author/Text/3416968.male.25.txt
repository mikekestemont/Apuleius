I've decided to begin keeping this blog, kind of as a personal Journal. Life, i'm learning, is all about moments in time...what you do, what goes on around you, mistakes made, and lessons learned as a result of those mistakes. So many times we look back on the past, and try and remember those lost moments; what we were feeling at a particular moment in time, what was the logic/our train of thought at that particular time...so that's pretty much the purpose of this blog.        In any case, this has been a pretty interesting week. Certain things I was sure about regarding who I am, and what I want for my future, were tested...and I learned more about myself. I entered some unchartered territory in regards to my love life. The guy I'm dating, Tony, opened my eyes to some truths about myself that I previously was unaware of. What were those truths? Well, I'm pretty hard to date...that much I knew, LOL, but the reasons were pretty eye opening.  Granted, he didn't come out and say these things the way I'm about to post them...these are just conclusions I came to based on our discussion. Okay...   1.  I'm Controlling: This much I already kinda knew. I like things to go a certain way, and when things don't go the way I'd like for them to go, I let the whole situation go. I don't leave much room for compromise.   2.  I can be very selfish: Not much elaboration needed here, LOL, when it comes to making room in my life for anyone other than my friends, I find this hard to do.   3.  Regardless of the strides I've made over the past 3 years...i'm still very much a loner.  Lord knows I've grown by leaps and bounds out of the person I used to be. If all my friends could somehow go back in time and see the person i used to be, they would be quite surprised at what they would see. I'm such a  different person, mentally, than I used to be. At the same time, I haven't changed who   I AM.   My heart and soul is essentially the same, I've just grown and matured in ways I never would have thought possible a few years ago.   4.  When I get aggitated and irritated it comes across in everything that I do or say, contrary to what I previously thought.   5.  I'm not ready to be in a relationship right now. Period.  Granted these aren't earth shattering revelations, just truths about myself that I need to work on. In the meantime I'm still dating Tony, surprisingly. I've decided to give this a shot, and see where, if anywhere, it leads. We'll see...   Anyway, the final episode of "Soul Food" is coming up on Wednesday...I'll be sure to have my kleenex nearby, LOL. I'm really going to miss this show. It's so rare to see an African American drama thats so well acted and directed, I fear it'll be a long time before we see one come along again. Unfortunately this show never got the praise and accolades it deserved, partly because it was on Showtime. In any case, I'm just grateful it lasted this long, and I'm trully going to miss it. I really hope Terri doesn't take Damon back. I know that just the "no second chances" part of me saying this, but that's me. He dogged her too many times, and we watched her hurt and go through all kinds of changes because of his insecurity and weakness, and as much as I adored them as a couple...he doesn't deserve her. She needs a strong man that can handle her. That can love her for who she is, and doesn't want to change her. I guess the reason I relate so much to this character, is because I see so much of myself in her. In any case, we'll see on Wednesday.  Top 5 Songs for the week:    1. Let's talk about our love - Brandy   2. Still in love - Teena Marie 3. Everytime - Britney Spears 4. Because of you - Marques Houston 5. Burn - Usher
Isn't it funny how the smallest things make the biggest impressions? This afternoon Tony came over. Usually on days that I have to work, I like to just chill alone until it's time for me to go in...and since I'm working nights this week I have a lot of time to do that. Well trying this whole relationship thing, I decided that sacrificing some of that "alone time" is part of my compromising...so I invited Tony over to spend the afternoon with me. I must admit, I wasn't the least bit excited about it, I tried to be, but when 4 o'clock rolled around and he still wasn't there I figured something came up and he wasn't going to make it. He finally did arrive, and he surprised me with flowers and a Spongebob T-Shirt!! That was so sweet, it's small, thoughtful things like that that are beginning to warm my heart towards him. I mean, I've waited so long for someone to show me the attention and affection that he is, and I must admit, it's nice. My mind is sending up warning flags that this is all happening too soon...but my heart is saying "So What?". How soon is too soon to get everthing you've been hoping for, and dreaming of for years? So right now there's a silent war waging between my head and my heart. I usually tread lightly, and over analyze everything, down to the tiniest detail...which is probably why I've yet to experience true love. Maybe this time I will follow my heart and see where it leads me. Love is reckless, Love is making mistakes, Love is being spontaneous...and all those things can lead to heartbreak, but isn't it worth it to capture those moments of happiness that only love can bring? Maybe the reason I use logic to make the majority of my decisions, is because it's easy, safe, a
