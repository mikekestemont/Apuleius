This has been a very exciting experience for me.  I have enjoyed all of the information sharing and ideas from each of you.  Good luck with your careers and I'll probably see you around!  Mary Hartsoe Marketing  HHS
In the Social Studies I Competency Goals for Special Education students at the high school level "Student must demonstrate an understanding of the three branches of the federal government and their functions."  The Textbook I use in class addresses this in 3 simple pages in chapter 7 section 4. As we talked before texts do not address topics in enough depth. I have found three websites that will serve as additional teaching aids in helping my students understand the branches of the federal government.  The Truman Presidential Museum and Library http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/teacher_lessons/3branches/1.htm  urlLink Cool link  Takes the reader through each branch of the federal government, what each is responsible for, what makes up each branch and the checks and balances that exist between each one. This site also has short question sections for the reader.  These question sections range from simple fill in the blank to short answers.  I usually spend a lot of my planning looking for more in depth questions to help my students understand the branches.  This site is interactive and has much of what I have done before all rolled into one.  Also, my students enjoy spending time in the computer lab because it is individualized and they can move at their own pace  Federal Government Branches- The United States http://www.lawmart.com/federalbranches.htm  urlLink Cool link  This website links you to the official websites for each branch of the federal government.  I like being able to use this website because my students can use this site to improve their internet skills as they search for specific information.  For example who are the US Senators from North Carolina?, How many cabinets are there in the executive Branch? How many woman are on the Supreme Court? and many other questions.  My students love to use the internet, but lack in certain retrieval skills that they made need to survive in the real world when they graduate.  Ben's Guide to US Government for Kids grades 6-8 http://bensguide.gpo.gov/6-8/government/branches.html  urlLink Cool link  I like this site because it is written to make sense to a middle school mind.  Most of my students operate at or near this level. I like the way that this site is able to go in depth with the different branches while at the same time not confusing the reader.  Many of the ideas or topics listed are things I have searched for in the past, but have trouble with the concepts getting to deep and for my students. urlLink   urlLink
One of the most important decisions that students will make in their lifetimes is what their career will be.  In order to make those decisions, they need to learn about themselves - their abilities and talents.  They need to know what careers are available.  These websites will help begin this process.  The website  urlLink www.princetonreview.com  has many resources.  I especially like under that under the career heading there is career quiz that is very simple (only 24 questions) but gives students a printout that is color coded with possible career options.  The website  urlLink www.scois.org  has a section termed Your Pathways to Success which has activities for learning about different careers.  The website  urlLink www.jobprofiles.monster.com  also gives great profile information about possible careers.
Unit III: Electronic Resources   urlLink Check out this link  Musuem of Tolerance: Children of the Holocaust  This site will enable students to see first hand what happened to children during the Holocaust.  The students will be assigned to read several biographies of children who survived the holocaust.  I will then give them the assignment of writing a bio-poem for a child of their choice.  They will have to type this poem using Microsoft Word and include a picture of their child.  I will then hang these pictures up on the bulletin board in the classroom.   urlLink Check out this link  Elibrary  Nigeria: Chapter 1E. Popular Disillusionment and Political Realignment; Robert Rinehart Countries of the World   01-01-1991 I will use this article to help the students understand the background for the story “In the Shadow of War” from their textbook.  I will have them read this article and highlight what they think is important.  After reading and highlighting, I will ask each student to come up to an overhead and write one important thing from the article to share with the class.  We will discuss what the students come up with.   urlLink Check this link out  It is very important to relate the war and peace theme for this lesson to what is going on today in Iraq.  The BBC News carries excellent news coverage, updated each day that will help the students see how war is affecting the Iraqi people.  I want them to understand that we are lucky to be in a country that for so long has been safe from war.  This site always includes facts about daily life in Iraq, information about the rebuilding of Baghdad, and many personal stories from all sides. I will take my students to the computer lab and have them explore this site.  They will be required to write journal responses to two personal stories and also give me a statistical view of life in Iraq.  Everything they need to provide me with these assignments is included on this site.
The lesson I am planning involves teaching the importances of being physically fit. I plan to do this by using the textbook Health: A Guide To Wellness, the internet sources that I have picked out for them, and my own personal experinces. In making this plan, I hope that each student will benefit from having learned the material and be able to apply the knowledge that was given to them to their everyday life.  I have compiled some internet sources for the students to work with. I personally have been to every site and approve of them because each site has valuable information.   urlLink C
