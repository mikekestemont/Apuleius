i was just out on my fire escape smoking a cigarette and this guy (blond, probably about thirty, not badly dressed) with a grey blanket over his shoulder is picking up rocks and throwing them around and screaming "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!!!" so i'm smoking and watching avidly while trying to remain discreet so he didn't notice. hiding a little behind our little lime tree even. and he loses interest in the rocks and he's off! down the street, which he crosses ("aaaaaaaaargh!") lunging at a car. when safely on the other side ("aaaaaaaaarg!!"), he thrashes his way past the little bus terminal on the sidewalk kicking at the ads. he goes past the trash barrel and then has a second thought and goes back to the can. he reaches in and pulls out a pepsi can and a green glass beer bottle ("aaaaaargghh!!") and he tosses the latter to the pavement, shattering it. he then (get this) takes a big slug off the pepsi can, and throws in back in the trash and continued ("aaaaaarhgh!!!") along the bridge. i extiguished my cigarette, climbed in the window, and was like, "what the fuck just happened?"
let me tell you something, there's nothing like good graffiti.  i was going to the bank today during my lunch break and i walk by a building and clear as day, in your face, 6 feet tall and hastily rendered in green:  NECK FACE.   hot.
i already reserved a spot on ahren's floor.&nbsp; you guys should act now before he starts raising the prices.
the last thing i was dreaming about before i was wrenched from sleep by max calling to wake me up:&nbsp; my friend stephen was thinking about taking a class and he was looking through a course catalog, and one of the courses was called: petting zoo.
i just found out my friend, mikey, is in jail.&nbsp; i started getting calls a few days ago a couple times a day from a computer recording that i couldn't understand the name of because it was all garbled.&nbsp;&nbsp; i was like, "i don't think i owe any money to anyone...hm."&nbsp; so, often the calls were at like 6am, and i was like, "what the fuck, who's calling me at this hour??", so i called the number back to see what was up and tell them to knock it off.&nbsp; so i find out it's some phone call place for inmates.&nbsp; and still it's not registering.&nbsp; and i finally talk to someone and they tell me that someone is trying to call my from prison.&nbsp; still not registering.&nbsp; so, then, i ask where the jail is, and they tell me billerica, ma, and i'm immediately like, "oh, fuck, what did mike do?"&nbsp; all i have to say is have you seen drugstore cowboy?
last night ahren called me on the way home from the sci show.&nbsp; we were chatting randomly about the band and the shows (he was telling me about little friends that he made that had backpacks full of pharmies and looked, of course, like a mess.)&nbsp; so this goes on pleasantly for a few minutes and then ahren says, "can you hold on for a second?"&nbsp; and i'm like, "totally".&nbsp; and there's a pause and i hear him in the background say, "ya, i'll have a number 2".&nbsp; i was dying.&nbsp; i love the thought of ahren eating jack in the box.&nbsp; and then my phone went dead.&nbsp; so, i called him right back and was like, "dude!!&nbsp; the suspense is killing me...what did you get to drink???"&nbsp; diet coke.&nbsp; i love the concept of ordering a shitload of fast food and then getting diet coke.&nbsp; i do it all the time.&nbsp; that's how i keep my boyish figure, friends.
so, last night max and i were playing boggle and i challenged him that ade was a word (like orange ade). &nbsp; turns out that it can't stand alone and is only a suffix (my friend jen and i had always agreed, in&nbsp;the copious games of our friendship, that it was a word.).&nbsp; but in the course of looking this up, max discovered the allure of the words at the top of the page in conjunction with each other, as they are juxtaposed serenipitously demarcating the bounardaries of what wordage is contained on the page.&nbsp; we started considering how the words could be related (in a scene or something) and of course we got laughing our proverbial asses off.&nbsp; some of our most favored pairings:&nbsp; schnozzle-scientific method; leopard seal-lethal; vagina-validate; and imprompu-inactivity.&nbsp; i took it one step further, suggesting that this would be a great way to generate a scene in an improv show.&nbsp; ah, flights of fancy...the imagination is a glorious place.   &nbsp;
actual game of boggle between max and me:
also, yesterday, i got what i believe to be my first call from a show (but my memory is shit).&nbsp; amy called me from moe. at the hampton casino ballroom.&nbsp; brent black.&nbsp; i was dancing in my living room with an idiotic smile on my face with the phone pressed to my head and max looking at me quizzically.
last night my friend francisco (who works in computer animation)&nbsp;told me that he and this other guy i know are working on a pilot about a monkey.&nbsp; they're doing the whole thing themselves and are going to try to sell it to cartoon network or comedy central.&nbsp; so i guess (obviously) this monkey has a russian accent, and yesterday they were starting to think about dubbing what they'd already created.&nbsp; and francisco and the other guy (chris) were the only ones who volunteered to try to give a russian-accented voice to the monkey in question.&nbsp; what interested me was that he was telling me that he discovered through a series of takes how difficult it is to make the recording sound animated and engaging.&nbsp; he said that he'd think he was way way overacting, and then he'd listen to it and think it sounded flat.&nbsp; somewhere in the middle of this, they started drinking.&nbsp; francisco had a few shots and loosened up a l
