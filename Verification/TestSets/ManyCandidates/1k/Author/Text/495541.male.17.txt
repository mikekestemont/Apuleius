So I end up being unsucessful with my idea of making my blog and my site the same design.  That's too bad.  I like this current design though.  I'll keep it until I can get the old idea working, maybe.  I think I'm going to go do my homework now.  I don't have anything to do, so I should get it over with.
Right now, I'm messing around with the template file on this blog.  I'm trying to get it to look exactly like my personal site found  urlLink here .  We'll see how it comes out.
I'm so mad now.  I just got done writing so much on things I rememberd and whatnot and I went to hit post and lost it all.  I'm so disappointed in BLOGGER right now.  I'm going to go cry now.
To begin this m...  That's when my sister, in her bed started in on me about being up so early and how she wanted me to stop.  So, needless to say I did.  To begin this morning I want to talk about the dreams I had the last few days.  Just last night, I dreamt about being, of all things, an astronaunt.  It was a very weird dream (but dreams are normally weird), I'd say.  It began, as far back as I can remember, with me inside the space shuttle.  It wasn't exactly the space shuttle though, from the inside.  In the inside, it looked more like a bus.  Then, as we landed in Dallas, I think as I rememberd the flight attendant say something about Dallas faintly.  We then oddly got on a bus, but before actually getting on the bus I didn't know it was a bus.  I first thought it was the actual shuttle I would take off on.  It had that astronaunt like walkway in front of it, just like the real shuttles have, I think.  It was weird.  Then, after getting off this bus, I went in my parents car and that's when I woke up.  A very weird dream.  I never thought anything about being an astronaunt one bit.  The other dream I want to talk about, I had Saturday night.  This, to date, is the weirdest dream I have ever had.  All I can really remember about this dream is that it was in the desert and the main thing of the dream was that we (who else, I don't know) drove around the desert on a road and frequently stopped and someway loaded this cart of creamfilled hotpockets in a cart.  It was the grossest thing ever.  To this day, I have this nasty taste of just biting into a dozen of those stupid creamfilled things just like a Hostess (sp?) cake snack.  That's really sickening.  It makes me wonder what's going on inside my head.  Today marks the first day of the brand new trimester at school.  I hope to get off to a good start.  Previously I have slacked off a lot and have not really cared much about school and with the new trimester I hope to change this.  I really do hope.  I aim at making a consious effort to keep good grades.  I'm not sure at all if I am going to actually get good grades, but I figure I should give it a try.  Who knows what could happen.  I could actually get good grades.  I believe that I have the capability to get good grades, it's just that I don't want it that bad.  I guess it had never meant that much to me to open the report card and see the fruit of hard labor.  I never really cared about good fruit.  So, I suppose you could say I'm now going for some good fruit this season.  That's all for now.  Have a good day.
I, at the moment, am currently going against the word of my mother.  I say this because if you read the last entry, you would know my mom told me to stay off the computer on Sunday and today is Sunday.  So I tell you this because I think you should know.  I think I'm addicted to using the computer.  It's either that or I just find it to be much more entertaining than sitting in front of the television.  Whatever the case, it's caused me to go against my mother.  So there you have it, I'm a sinner and you know because I've admitted it.  Sometimes I just hate the things I do, but after, I have no idea why I did them.  I think, what could have possibly caused me to be so horrible at that point in time.  I can honestly tell you most of the time, I can never figure it out.  It would be as if I had lost my mind completely at the time.  I'm not sure what I'm saying is completely true or sane for that matter.  I can only assure you of one thing... the things that end up in this blog come only from one person and that person is me.  That's all for now, I suppose.  Good night.
This is my first post on my brand new blog.  In this blog, I hope to talk about whatever in my life I am currently doing, experiencing, and thinking about.  I'm pretty sure it will be interesting, so don't worry about this being boring.  And as an informational note, I plan to make these posts as frequently as possible and as long as I can.  By long, I mean describe things as well as I can, and in a way that things and ideas are vivid and easy to understand.  This maybe pose to be difficult for me because I am not a very good writer, but I hope to have fun with this blog.  One main thing I hope to have at this blog is actual visitors.  It would be nice to get feedback from people on things I talk about.  That would be great, but to start out, I won't expect much as far as visitors.  This i
