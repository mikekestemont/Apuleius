1. What do you most want to be remembered for? For always trying to do the best I could do with most things I have accomplished.    2. What quotation best fits your outlook on life? "I'm OK when everything is not OK" - Tori Amos   But they tend to change, depending on my mood.  This one seems to work a lot of the time.   3. What single achievement are you most proud of in the past year? Graduating San Francisco State University Cum Laude with a BA in English & Creative Writing- all while working full time the whole time.    4. What about the past ten years? Surviving many obstacles that have been thrown at me in the last ten years- it would have been a lot even if they occurred in the last 20.    5. If you were asked to give a child a single piece of advice to guide them through life, what would you say? A single one is difficult.....but I would say to always stand up for what you believe- no matter what your peers say.
Looks like I get to see both of my hotties today~ Todd & Rick!!  Todd was on very briefly on Fox Report (as he always is- briefly).  During his segment, he was only shown once- but that's ok.  I can deal with that.....as long as I get to tape my other hottie tonight!
Wow, talk about a dichotomy of days......I get to work, and think hmmmm......I guess I'll check my alternate email....I'm *sure* I won't have a response today from Rick, as I just emailed last night.  I open my email to find one new message- from  Leventhal, Rick .  After I've hyperventillated and sqealed a little (inwardly, but a little squeak escaped), I read what he wrote:   your photo is signed and will soon be delivered! thanks for watching, and caring. it's gratifying to know my hard work is appreciated... and i'm humbled by all the interest in me! take care and please stay tuned, rick   All I can say, is WOW.  Like my blog buddy Melissa, I can't stop grinning from ear to ear!  She got a response to her email yesterday and was just sooooo happy & surprised- we're both in absolute heaven now!!  Now, I have to just hope that the PO doesn't lose it.......*sigh*  Work sucks today, though.  Long story, too long to get into here- suffice it to say that I'm getting crap that I shouldn't be getting.  And no one wants to take it back, and no one's telling me what to do with it when I ask.  Well.  I have a suggestion........ ; )  I'll be ladylike though, and leave that to your imagination!  It's just really frustrating.....oh so many times *I* could have gone out on stress leave....but didn't.  I just don't believe in doing that (me, personally anyway.  I think it's spineless.).  These people go out on so called stress, well, what the hell do they think is happening when they leave?  We're *all* under stress, some of us just know how to deal with it better than others, I guess.    Oh, but my Rick email.......wow.  I'm just flabbergasted that he emailed back- so quickly!! We're talking less than 12 hours.  OMG...

"Work matters may be unsettled today. Plans may not work out as you had hoped, but even in disappointment victory is possible. Changes taking place now will benefit you financially in the long run. The more you take things in stride, the better off you are now. Someone you perceive as an ally might not be as supportive as you think today. At the present time this individual's intentions aren't in harmony with yours. Your fortunate astrological number for today is 370. Your financial outlook for today is excellent. Your compatible sign for today is Leo."    So sayeth my horoscope for today.    Not to sound negative, but isn't everyday at this job unsettled for me- LOL?  God knows I try to take things in stride, and I know of many (esp. here, i.e. at work) that I have thought of as allies have turned out to *not* be supportive at all, so I'm prepared for that one at least! ;s  That's OK- I know everyone has their own agenda to tend to.  Including me ;D
