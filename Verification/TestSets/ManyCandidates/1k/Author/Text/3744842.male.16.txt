Today was boring for the first half.  Melinda is gone to kentucky for a whole stinkin week........i'm sad.  I already miss her and she just left this afternoon, its going to be a long week.  Today i went to band practice which went well when we finally got started, it was fun though.  Church was fun tonight, as usual, then after that we went out to go to the movies, guys night out, but then the little girls couldnt be home that late and couldnt watch a movie! How gay.  So we went to marble slab instead, it was goooood.
What a long boring day..........anything else need to be said?
Today was another great day, I almost didnt wake up in time to go to sunday school this morning, but i did.  This morning i went to church and afterwards i went to O'Charley's with Melinda and her mom, which is always great. When i came home i went straight to bed, it was probly about 1 and i slept till 5. Then i got ready and went to church, where Hanna-Grace gave me a picture she drew for me.........quite funny.  After church we went out to eat with the few of us that were there. It was melinda, me, joe, and amory and we went to graffiti's pizza. The food was good, but expensive and it was loud in there too. Isnt life grand!
Today was a lot of fun. First thing that happened was we got called at 9:00 in the morning to come to kellye's house to clean up her yard...........someone rolled it last night.  It was a big mess, whoever did it should be ashamed........or proud one.  While we were there Mrs.Watts fixed us a very nice big breakfast, then we headed out to go to J.w.'s house to ride four-wheelers. It was muddy and a ton of fun.  It was shaun, j.w., and me all there riding, it wasnt that muddy but enough to get a four-wheller really stuck.  Thats about all for now, today has been great, and it just keeps getting better!
Today was a very long exausting day. The first part of the day i was working vbs, with 4-year olds........its fun, but they can be a hand full.........well two hand fulls, but its all good.  After that i found out i had to work so i went to work, almost lost my finger though, whew it was close.  After that i got to go out to eat with my family, including my little cousin, she can be really fun! Then i came back home and went to an incredable bible study that the most awesome lady i know is teaching(i love you mrs.janis). Its about this max lucado book called "Its Not About Me"..........seems to be a really cool book.  Once again thanks everyone for putting up with me! i love you all
This weekend was absolutely amazing..........it all started wensday night with church, which was great.  Music was great and the word from Mr.Reed was right on.  Well then the really best part began that night, we left after church to go to the lake, we made it to the lake kinda late, for some people anyway, i was wide awake though..........lol.  Well then the next day it rained a lot, but it was all good because that just gave us an excuse to lay around and do nothing.  That day the sun did come out though, long enought for me and blake to kneeboard a little, i got hurt just a little, but it was all good, had fun doing it and thats all that matters.  Then the next day was the start of the best day of my life.  It was great weather all day, not to hot, but cold either and not raining.  It was a perfect lazy afternoon at the lake with the best company ever, then for dinner we went to a restuarant on the lake that was a lot of fun, it was just me, Melinda, Amory, and Blake, ha we ditched the parents for once.......... then when we got back to the dock the jet-ski had misteriously disappeared...........so then we went looking for that.  I didnt really mind looking for it because the sunset was absolutely amazing and i was with my absolute favorate person, so it was great.  Then when we got back, we had no luck finding the jet-ski either by the way, well when we got back it was a full moon and the stars were out...........it was just the best, i love stuff like that.  If i wouldnt get bored i would be an astrolagist..............but it was the best night ever, best company, perfect everthing, it was just too much fun.  Then we all got drunk on who knows what and played uno...........lol, bad idea, the game lasted for what felt like forever.  It was fun though.  Then today we woke up and it was another great day, except for the fact it was the day we were leaving.............i really really really wanted to stay...........but i knew i had to come back.  It was the best time of my life and i wish i could just go back and re-live it over and over again.
Today was pretty boring............it started off with and was mostly composed of work. I had to wake up this morning and go work at this guy's house that i know from church..........cut grass etc.&nbsp; Then at about 5 i got home and washed my brother's truck.........then i went to toco bell to get dinner and since then i've done absolutely nothing. But i did find out i'm going to the lake next week........its gonna be a lot of fun!
Today started off pretty funny actually........i was still in bed at noon or so when the acountant for my dad's bussiness gets here and rings my doorbell while i'm dead asleep.&nbsp; I was dead asleep but it woke me up, i was in a dazed state and just took her to where she needed to be then went inside and took a s
