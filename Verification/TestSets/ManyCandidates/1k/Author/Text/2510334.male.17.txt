It has been a couple of days, but how hot has it been?  For those of you not in England, the summer has indeed arrived. Though everybody is walking around saying ‘nice weather, be a heat wave soon’, mainly because between the last time it was this hot and now we have had all the bad weather under the sun for about 7 months.  But life must go on despite the heat, and this past few weeks I have been sitting my AS level exams I’ve had eight in total for four subjects, and my last exam was yesterday for economics. Now, normally (as has been the case for every other year of exams) I would have been revising heavily every night or so. Not this year, I’ve done in total about 6 hours worth, which sounds a lot but it isn’t when you imagine me doing it at midnight or watching the TV. So I have no idea what my grades are going to be like but I fear I will disappoint myself and my family.  I have had a lot on as well as school. I recently got a new job in a clothing store called River Island and they have been giving me a lot more hours a week, then there is being with Martin which I love doing, and that takes up most of time and I wouldn’t have it any other way. But the bad things are that I haven’t been out for a drink months, I haven’t had time to go swimming or to the beach or doing anything summery, I’m always busy or skint (poor).  So, it looks like I’m will be bringing in more money, I will just be too busy and too tired to spend it on anything worthwhile. All I want to do after work or at the weekend is to jump into a big cool pool, but I have to walk somewhere because getting the bus will be a waste of money, and the sun gets hotter, and I get more annoyed,  so the sun does indeed jest. Summer fun!
Just before Christmas last year I decided that it would be a brilliant idea to get an eyebrow piercing, my main drive being to get it done before my ex-boyfriend did. I happened to casually mention in to a friend whilst in town and she insisted that we go and do immediately. After some deliberation I agreed and off we went. I subjected myself to a certain degree of pain and then paid £24 for the priviledge.  Now advice for any person thinking of doing something similarIfff you take it out for more than 2 hours it WILL close over. I thought 'that's fine, it won't hurt to much to shove a piece of metal though my skin'. Big mistake. One month later I ended up going to bed with a slightly swollen eye and woke up with a satsuma attached to my eye-socket. I wouldn't want to disgust you but after taking it out I realised what was actually in all the swelling.  So I made an appointment at my nearest surgery. 'I'm sorry you are not resgistered here' she says. 'That's right I moved about five minutes further from my old surgery and they kicked me out' I say. 'well if you come down at 5 PM you can fill out some forms and register'.  So I go to a history exam with one eye and then go straight to the doctor's and having not been ill that often was quite shocked but also amused at the things I saw. I followed the warren of corridors to the 'upstairs waiting area' in the surgery built in a Victorian House and took my seat. Across from me was a young man about 22 falling asleep, to my right was an old man... falling asleep, completely unable to keep his head up. to my left was a woman with her head back, quite possibly asleep. Then across the room was a man that looked completely terrified and this was only made worse when his name was called. he bowed his head, either to pray or deliberate whether he was going to go in. I just sat there and thought that my condition wasn't really worthy of an appointment compared to these people. in fact the only other person who looked relativlely calm and alert was a guy about my age 16 or 17 with a nice pair of legs,so I decided to pass the time taking glances at them. Not at all harmful, i'm still completely devoted to my boyfriend. I do remember sitting there and thinking he would probaly do the same thing in my position.  So that was about it they slowly got picked off one by one, and i eventually left with a course of antibiotics and the smell of TCP on my clothes.  So ot looks like all of got to concude is that doctor's surgerys are full of sick, tired people. a revelation I know!
I've sat here at my computer since my boyfriend left (about an hour ago) and trawled through various blog sites. I discovered a few things;  1. You can actually get an award for blogging from the guardian newspaper (a v. posh paper read by nearly employee of the educational system in the UK)  urlLink Guardian Article  2. It can actually get quite expensive to blog up to $130 for a years worth of blogging 3. In my opinion most blogs will never ever be read because of the time needed to trawl blogs to find a subject interesting to you but you might try  urlLink BlogPulse  4. And perhaps the single most important thing I have found out is that there is no perfect formula for blogging and its best to keep it simple and write a load of crap off the top of your head like I'm doing right now...  So, blogging, a valued tool to all Microsoft employees who dedicated minutes a day to enlightening their colleagues and captivated c
