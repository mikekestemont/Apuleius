Police say woman bit suspect following rape  BY BEN SCHMITT , FREE PRESS STAFF WRITER April 16, 2002   A 31-year-old Detroit man suspected of raping a woman who bit and nearly severed his penis has spent most of his adult life in prison, court records show.  Detroit Police Cmdr. Dennis Richardson said Monday that investigators are trying to determine whether the suspect could be connected to any other rapes. Investigators questioned the man Monday after his release from St. John Northeast Hospital, where he received stitches for the injury.  The suspect is under arrest on preliminary charges of criminal sexual conduct and armed robbery, police said.   The suspect served 11 years in prison on a 1989conviction in Wayne County Circuit Court for assault with intent to commit murder. He was released on Oct. 1, 2000, according to state Department of Corrections records.   On Sunday, police allege that the man robbed and attacked a 36-year-old woman on Detroit's east side and dragged her at gunpoint into an abandoned home at 14461 Mayfield. He approached her on the street with a gun about 5 p.m., ordered her to "walk with me," and took her into the home, ordering her to remove her clothing, according to police reports. He stole $42 from her purse and two gold rings from her fingers as she undressed, police said.   Then he allegedly raped and sodomized her, telling her, "You make a sound, I'll kill you," according to police reports.   The woman told the attacker that she couldn't breathe, police said. He ignored her and she ended the attack by biting and lacerating his penis, police said.   Police said the suspect then ran to his nearby home, where he told his wife that he injured himself on a backyard fence while running from a dog. She took him to the hospital.   Meanwhile, investigators interviewed the rape victim and followed a blood trail from the location of the assault to the suspect's home, where they found a large puddle of blood in his dining room, according to the police report.   Police said they located the suspect after calling area hospitals and matching his description with a man who was being treated at St. John Northeast.   Carey Goryl, a spokeswoman at Turning Point crisis center in Mt. Clemens, praised the victim for doing what she had to do to stop the attack and stay alive.   "It's amazing what people will do to get out of a terrifying situation," Goryl said.
Flasher escapes after being caught in his own zipper By CINDY CLAYTON, The Virginian-Pilot © April 4, 2002   VIRGINIA BEACH -- A 12-year-old girl confronted by a flasher in an elevator Monday night reacted quickly: She grabbed his zipper and yanked it up.  The two were in an elevator at the Suburban Lodge in the 400 block of South Independence Boulevard at 7:50 p.m., said police spokesman Mike Carey.   The man was injured, and the girl ran out of the elevator and found her stepfather to tell him what happened, Carey said. The stepfather found the suspect running from the building, and the two men fought. The suspect broke free and ran away.   Because he suffered blood loss, the man probably suffered injuries significant enough for him to seek medical treatment, Carey said. Investigators have been checking for him at area hospitals.   The suspect is described as 5 feet 7 inches tall with a medium build and dark, curly hair. He was wearing a black T-shirt and tan vest. He may have fled in a purple Ford Ranger pickup truck with four-wheel drive.   The man faces a felony charge of taking indecent liberties with a minor. The case is being investigated by Detective Mark Vidrine of the police department's Special Victims Unit.   Police said the girl was unharmed.   Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Solvers at 1-888-LOCK-U-UP.
Sexy tree too much for some Westside neighbors  Santa Cruz Sentinel May 09 2002  By DAN WHITE Sentinel staff writer    A Westside resident called the cops Monday to report an allegedly phallic tree.   Officers responded to the Liberty Street home but found no wrongdoing. They said the 20-footer — actually an evergreen hedge of the Luma genus — is protected by its owner’s right to artistic freedom.   "We contacted the city attorney," said Sgt. Brad Goodwin. "It could be interpreted anywhere from being free speech to being artistic. It’s really nothing we have control over."   All trees can be seen as "phallic," but some would argue this eugenia is especially so. Viewed from the front, the hedge looks to have testicles, or perhaps bosoms.   Eugenia is a common plant noted for white flowers and edible fruits, according to the Sunset Western Garden Book. Sunset says the plant "performs best" in well-drained soil.   The owner of the tree, Gillian Greensite, said she found it peculiar the plant has been there at least 15 years and suddenly someone is mad about it. She said no one has complained to her about the plant.   Greensite, director of UC Santa Cruz’s rape prevention and counseling program, also questioned what the offended neighbor was really seeing in this tree.   "If they want to see phallic, they see phallic, I guess. I see trees," said Greensite, an outspoken advocate of tree preservation in the city.   She added the eugenia was "not trimmed for any particular purpose."   The complaining neighbor could not be reached for comment Tuesday.   A second neighbor, who asked that her name not be used, said she found the tree irksome but has grown "numb" to it over the years. But she said it’s annoying to "all of a sudden hear kids screeching and laughing about the tree.   "They’re good neighbors, believe me," she said, referring to Greensite’s household. "(But) we have older folks around here."   The neighbor also said the tree has become a beacon for annoying sightseers.
