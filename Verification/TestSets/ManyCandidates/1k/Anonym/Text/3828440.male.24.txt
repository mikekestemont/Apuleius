that something makes us vulnerable that we do love...or hate. Hayrides and sock hops..a thing of the past in a distant future reality if you will.  A past present future tense.  An abrupt halt, your soul rising to heaven and then just ceasing to rise, just ceasing to be.  You've become reality so reality doesn't think you exist...but in the imaginations of little children and the mentally ill.  A fraudulant portrayal of an actual existing thread of fate.

My heart is overflowing This blood racing through my veins My heart pounding in my chest Feelings not felt in awhile manifested They belong to you and you alone My walls torn down Replaced with an ever increasing desire to be with you To watch you to love you Passion utter passion An urge to be next to you an urge...urge... A longing to show you how i feel and how much i feel it Touches in love Traces of my fingertips across your body... Remembrance, remembering how you feel Scent lingers on me Your porcelin skin....the contours of your body... You fit.  Everything i feel is reality Though Chaotic Such is love Order is not always beautiful My life ordered for a time Is Chaos because of you Beautiful chaos You are my reality and that is chaos My moon my star my heart....such is l
