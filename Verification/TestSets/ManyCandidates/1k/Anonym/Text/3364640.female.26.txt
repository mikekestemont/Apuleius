trouble for and possibly even fired. Now do I tell my boss, do I let it go, or do I use it as blackmail against her??? I'm thinking blackmail. Hey I'm a sneaky, no-good, underhanded, get-what-I-want-by-skill-or-by-force kind of girl. When it comes down to it. I'm just a little mean and it would teach her a lesson to ever bring up my name in a conversation I'm not in. >:)  She thinks I'm a lesbian because I'm always talking about Jessica to my coworkers. I'm sorry. I live with the girl. She's my best friend. I've known her for eight years. We have a lot of stories, and fun moments. Plus a few coworkers know her and are always asking about her. Oh, but if I talk about about a girl then that instantly makes me a fucking dyke. Hello flashbacks to high school. Just because I didn't go out with any of the guys from my high school that made me a lesbian too. Until I brought the cutest boy to some god aweful dance, which I only stayed at for fifteen minutes before sneaking out and driving off somewhere to make out. He lived in Auburn which was an hour and a half drive with out traffic and I wasn't allowed to drive all the way out there but I did anyhow. I drove this little navy blue toyota 4-speed truck. I always had to be the driver though...  Today I'm playing office bitch. I've been sent to go get my boss coffee and money from the ATM. I'm making a million copies for her and it's going by pretty fast, pretty easy. I didn't even want to come to work today so ya know? It's not that bad. I look like a high school girl and I can't stop listening to Morrissey and Enon. More of the latter though.
hahaha...  you told me once that you didn't date blondes. Oh but you aren't, you're just fucking one.  I'm amused.  I love it when random thoughts come flying into my head.
I started taking those fucking pills again.  The Lexapro.  I talked to Kevin today about being unhappy.  I think he understood.  He mentioned he wasn't feeling very happy lately either, and that maybe the weather was to blame.  I wouldn't doubt it.  it's been grey, foggy, sprinkly, dark and cold for weeks now.  But I think my unhappiness is more than just the weather.  I think the weather just makes it worse is all.  So I'm back on the fucking happy pills.  The pills that make my stomache feel upset more than it already does.  They make me feel like I have morning sickness.  I hope they make me feel better, sooner.. I don't want to wait three months to feel good again.   It's not like I'm sitting around sulking all the time.  I usually keep it bottled up.  I still enjoy sitting around with my room mates watching movies and tv.  Going out, getting drunk, having fun.  It's just the quiet alone times that bother me so damned m
