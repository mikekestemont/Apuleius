is an Iranian lawyer and human rights activist.  She was the first female judge in Iran before the revolution that overthrew the Shah and began the Shia theocracy that has ruled the country since.  Since then, she has worked as a lawyer and teaches at the University of Tehran.  She was recently awarded the Nobel Prize for her work for democratic reforms in Iran.    Read:   urlLink    (Image source: skippingtowardsgomorrah.com)  One of my favorite books.  Dan Savage takes a look at the seven deadly sins in America.  While conservatives are whining about the moral decline of our nation, Savage takes a tour of America and finds that, actually, the sinners aren't all that bad, and neither is the state of our nation.  His book is funny and insightful, as Dan Savage is apt to be in general.     See:   urlLink Donnie Darko  Director's Cut    (Image source: news.bbc.co.uk)  I finally saw Donnie Darko, after what?  Three or four years?  It was great, just as everyone and their mom said it was.  Now, the director's cut is being released in theaters.  It's currently showing in Seattle as part of the Seattle International Film Festival and will be released nationwide this summer.    Surf:   urlLink Salam Pax, "Baghdad Blogger"     (Image source: londonandthenorth.com)  With the fall of Saddam Hussein came a limited measure of freedom in Iraq.  Iraqis now have unfettered access to the Internet, and since the beginning of the war, the most accurate and timely reporting from Iraq has come from Iraqis themselves.  The most famous of Iraqi bloggers is Salam Pax.  It looks as though the site is on hiatus, but there's plenty to read and get caught up on in the meantime.  It also seems there's a book out.    Watch:   urlLink     I tend to avoid CNN and Fox News Channel as much as possible.  When I want to watch the news, I like it presented in a straightforward manner.  What's important to me is not how good their graphic designers are, but the quality of the news presented.  I prefer the style of BBC News, but it's hard for me to catch it since it's only run once in a while on BBC America.  Newsworld International is in the same kind of vein as BBC News.  I first discovered them while flipping through the channels after the 9/11 attacks.  NWI's presenters don't look like models, their graphics aren't in your face, but they present the news in a much more balanced fashion than either Fox News or CNN.  This is probably due to the fact that, although it is an American network, the content is mainly produced by CBC (the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation).  NWI also runs news programs from overseas, including English language versions of newscasts from Germany, China, and Japan.  Vice President Al Gore and a partner recently purchased Newsworld International and have promised to shift the focus of the channel to presenting news aimed at Americans aged 18-34.  As of yet, there have been no programming changes, at least none that I've noticed.
Taking a little unexpected break.  I'll be back on M
