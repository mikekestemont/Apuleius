wait..
yup so I saw her today... hehe.. and she says I make her a little week in the knees when Im around her.. :) I know ive been neglecting pics up here as late... I'll have to find something to post up here next time.. which will be very soon... so.. yeah.. hehe seeya
Yes yes... I now have someone... and that's all I'm gonna say.. nothing more.. lol aaand my brother is in here as usual.. playing another damn game of Halo... ahhh will there ever be some peace? lol well that's about it..
yes yes I took down a post.. just because it made me a tad uncomfortable its up there... lol.. It even surprises me my pic is still up.. but anyway.. i think im gonna get some sleep now.. buuut Im GOING to wake up earlier than usual today... Im going to set jetAudio to wake me up... so.. anyway... seeya later people...Oo quick update.. my fav Avril song is Things I'll Never Say.... lol I guess because Id like someone to sayy that to me... see.. during songs I take place as if im the guy they are singing about.. or if the guy is singing.. I think of myself as him... it makes it better... and another quick update... lol Im gonna go search for that Why song Amber Marie recommended... lol quick arent i?
ahhh and reguarding that question... I think..... I like.. The First album a little bit more than the other one... and yes I do like Nobody's Home even though I am the kind of guy who likes the "happy" songs more... but... lol it doesnt seem to matter with Avril
ahhh yes... I already listened to both albums and my fav songs are Sk8er Boi, Things I'll Never Say, Nobody's Fool, Happy Ending, Fall To Pieces, Slipped Away, and Take Me Away... OK so.. i have a lot of favorite songs that she has... she's the second highest rated artist in my iTunes Library... only second to John Mayer mhmm Im listening to Things I'll Never Say right now.. hehe I just cant seem to get enough right now...
Hehe you know... Its odd sometimes how long it'll take me to catch onto something good... I just got home and now I started listening to Avril Lavigne now.. hehe I like it... and she's kinda cute to.. so.. lol already have all three of her albums including her Live Acoustic album which is good too.. I have my computer turned the way it should.. and it feels more natural and less cluttered like this.. and it makes my computer seem more streamlined. Its always fun to have something new that you like isnt it?
mhmm so Im still over my dad's and my brother is currently laying down attempting to go to sleep... aaand Im still logging on me dad's computer.... caant wait to see what kind of information hehe and I successfully set up two monitors with no more problems like earlier.. hehe aaand well lol hmmm I got nothin else to say soo t
