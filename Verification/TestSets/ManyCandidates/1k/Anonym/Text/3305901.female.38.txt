drives a garbage truck through a neighborhood before 5 a.m. should be beaten with a steel garbage can lid until they puke up trash. Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.
If I was Amish, why would I even be on TV?  If you continually produce tv shows full of mindless dribble, or are entertained by the majority of the crap that's on network tv... reality beatdown.  Also you all now get a collective beatdown... consider yourself beatendown.
People who go into a stall and wait for the first person to walk in to ask, "Hey, buddy, can you pass some paper under to me?" HELL no, you nasty bastard. Pinch it off explain it to your wife later when she does the laundry. Beatdown with the Charmin.
People who miss work and sleep..... all day......  definately deserve a beatdown.  (or a spankin)  xxxooooooooooo
People who complain about people not leaving comments on their site, yet haven't posted anything new for 5 days - BEATDOWN!  :)
People that visit my blog but don't leave a comment deserve a beatdown with a mouse.
The Sandman.  That fucker rarily comes to visit, and when he does, he leaves quickly like I'm a $2 ho.  Beatdown with your empty sandbags, soaking wet and with vivacity.
Cool people who drive by and flash 7x7 signs, in huge bold red letters, that say "HI!"  They deserve forgiveness for at least 2 earned beatdowns.  Very cool.
Best Buy at 23rd and 6th.  For not letting me in at 6:51 tonight.  Why?  "We close at 7."  I guarantee I could have found what I needed and been at the register in under 9 minutes.  Beatdown with every DVD copy of "Just Married" left on your shelves.
If you miss something in a conversation and apologize with " Sorry, had a blonde moment", Beatdown with a bottle of peroxide.
People who work in bagel places/delis and do not understand the meaning of "a little bit of cream cheese."  It's great that you're being generous and giving, but no human being could eat that much cream cheese and live.  Least of all one who's pretty sure he's lactose intolerant.  Beatdown with a 5 lb. block of Philadelphia.
1. Customers who ask you a question about what they want to buy and then answer their CELL PHONE in the middle of your answer.  2. Women who come into your store and say, "I'd like to try on everything you have in size 12. I'll meet you in the dressing room."  3. People who return clothing that they have clearly worn to an event. It smells like sweat, the tag is taped to the inside of the sleeve and they are soulless asshats.  4. People who don't understand that hitting on a person who has NO OTHER CHOICE than to be nice to you is abominable. Don't you get it? You can be a complete pig, but if I'm on commission I still have to kiss your ass. And even if I'm not, I still have to be polite or risk getting fired.  You all deserve a beatdown with overpriced leather luggage and power suits still on the h
