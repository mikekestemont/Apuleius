and I was ranked 206 out of 413 contestants. Not bad for my first tournament. I'm not quite in the money, but I've got a good chance.  Twenty minutes later the whole thing comes crashing down. At this point, I'm in the top 150, sitting on just over 5,000 in chips (every player started with 1,500) when this player with a short stack (about 1,200 in chips) goes all-in before the flop. This is quite a gamble as he has not seen the flop and has no idea what cards could come up. Everyone folds except me and another player. The flop comes and there is a King on the board, which just so happens to match the two I was dealt. I figure I'm in excellent shape to win this hand. I bet another 1,500 hoping the other player will follow me in. He does and I can just smell the pot now.  The turn card is a diamond, putting three diamonds on the board. The other player bets a weak 300 and I raise to 1,000. He re-raises to put me all in. Normally, I would back down from this call. However, I was fairly certain that his hand was not better than mine. There were no face cards on the table other than the king, no straight possibility, and a doubtful flush.  We turn over our cards and I was right. The guy who went all in prior to the flop only had a pair of nines, I had three kings, and the other player had an Queen/Seven unsuited. He did however have a diamond, giving him four, which gave him a slim opportunity to suck out the flush. Well, this post isn't called the first bad beat for nothing. Sure enough, another diamond fell on the river, giving him the pot and knocking me out of the tournament.  Let's just say my computer desk took quite a fist pounding. I had the best hand all the way to the end and got screwed by a hand that shouldn't have even played past the flop. I ended up in 310th place and out of the money. On the whole, I can't complain, I did outlast over 1,700 other players. And, unless an expert comes in and tells me otherwise, I would play that hand the same way again. I think...

Like it says at the top of the screen, my goal is to win a poker championship within one year of today's date: August 16, 2004. I decided to create a blog dedicated to this so I can share my successes and horror stories. I like to think I'm pretty good at poker, so I'm going to find out.  Of course, in order to document my progress properly, I'm going to have to figure this blogging thing out. Right now, I'm totally confused as to how I'm supposed to upload photos. I'll figure it out though.  I'll periodically update you with my growth as well as direct you to some other interesting poker s
