in storage. For the life of me fictional reader, I have no fucking clue what's in them. Obviously many of the possessions stored therein are non essential, as I've done without these things for many months now and am alive and kicking.  There are books along with the many keepsakes amassed from my time with Adrienne that I could not bring myself to part with so readily. Clothes, Knick-Knacks, and all the barracks-ratish accoutrements I feel must be let go, so that this time maybe my life can be summed up in only four boxes. Why do we humans horde such trivial things in our lifetimes? I myself am not one day returned home and already find myself plotting to spend my hard earn dollars on new nothings to replace my obsolete nothings of yesteryear. It is not a sin to amass wealth and possessions. It is when these things rule our lives do we cross boundaries into the realm of insanity.  Why am I still awake you might ask, dearest reader? The answer is simple, unprofessionalim. Here is a small lesson for you, should you ever find yourself a sergeant in the American Army. When you realize that a guard roster must be generated for the following day's duty, do yourself a small favor. Be proactive and do it yourself. Do not knock on Sgt. Andrews' door and ask him to do it for you. He will in the end not like you for it and tell you unceremonious and much less cordially then you had expected, to fuck off. That being said, I believe I shall make a second attempt to crawl into bed and sleep. As always I pray and perhaps selfishly hope to dream of her. But these are the private things I share with you and no other dear reader.   urlLink   Tyler Durden     : We're consumers. We are by-products of a lifestyle obsession. Murder, crime, poverty, these things don't concern me. What concerns me are celebrity magazines, television with 500 channels, some guy's name on my underwear. Rogaine, Viagra, Olestra.    urlLink   Narrator     : Martha Stewart.     urlLink   Tyler Durden     : Fuck Martha Stewart. Martha's polishing the brass on the Titanic. It's all going down, man. So fuck off with your sofa units and Strinne green stripe patterns.
When I dream of her I am always grateful , dear reader. The nice ones are always the hardest to wake up from. This morning when I awoke there was made a futile attempt to return to sleep and resume where we had left off. It's good to run into old friends, even if they are no longer real to you, as you are unreal to them. This gets harder by the day, not easier as I thought it would be by now. But that's life, sometimes you just can't go back to sleep. I should have access to the net for most of the day, but really don't have much else to say aside from these little quips in passing.  I hope she enjoys her weekend. Mine is...well, I'm h
