13 minutes ago  Add U.S. National - Reuters to My Yahoo!  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A New York state man who sent out millions of "spam" e-mails was sentenced to 3-1/2 to seven years in prison, the state attorney general's office said on Thursday.  Howard Carmack, known as the "Buffalo Spammer," received the maximum sentence for 14 counts of identity theft and forgery, a spokesman for New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said.   Carmack sent out 825 million bulk e-mail messages using stolen identities and forged addresses, the court found, and was the first defendant to face charges under the state's new identity-theft statute.   He was found guilty in April.   The forgery conviction fetched the longest sentence, while the other convictions drew shorter sentences of one year to four years. All will be served concurrently, Spitzer spokesman Brad Maione said.   Carmack could be out in 3-1/2 should he behave in prison, Maione said.   Internet provider EarthLink Inc (Nasdaq:ELNK - news). won a $16.5 million judgment against Carmack last year, and EarthLink officials testified in the criminal trial as well.   "We're satisfied that today's sentencing sends a strong message to spammers, and EarthLink will continue to investigate spammers and work with law enforcement," said EarthLink assistant general counsel Karen Cashion in a statement.   Unwanted bulk messages now account for roughly 83 percent of e-mail traffic, according to filtering company Postini Inc.   Many of Carmack's alleged activities are illegal under a national anti-spam law that took effect in January, seven months after he was charged.
urlLink 'Key peak still in Pakistani occupation' - The Times of India   CHANDIGARH : A former Indian Army officer has claimed a few strategic peaks in the Kargil sector of Jammu and Kashmir , including the crucial Point 5353, were still under occupation by Pakistani forces.   Brig. Surinder Singh, who was dismissed from service in June 2001, also claimed the Indian defence establishment had misled the country by claiming it had gained control on the peaks in Kargil, where India and Pakistan fought a brief border conflict in 1999.   Singh was sacked after being embroiled in a controversy with his superiors about alleged lapses and intelligence failures that led to Pakistan-backed intruders occupying strategic features along a 140-km stretch of the Line of Control.   He asserted he had proof that Point 5353, a hill in the Drass sector of north Kashmir , was still under Pakistani occupation.   "I have evidence of this claim including satellite images," he told reporters.   Singh said the alleged inaction of the defence and political leadership during the Kargil conflict was only the tip of the iceberg.   "The defence establishment had misled the nation about getting every intruder out of the Kargil sector. I can give proof of this to whatever committee the new government at the centre sets up," Singh said, noting he had written about the matter to Defence Minister Pranab Mukherjee.   Singh said he had asked Mukherjee to order a thorough probe into the Kargil conflict and issues that were deliberately hidden by the previous coalition government led by the Bharatiya Janata P
