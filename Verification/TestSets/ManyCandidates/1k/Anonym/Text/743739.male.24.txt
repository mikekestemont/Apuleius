as we arrived at the hotel at 3am, I believe.  Tuesday Tuesday I slept.  Oh yeah and ate TCBY yogurt, losing that was the worst thing that ever happened to Stillwater.  Wednesday Umm yeah, more sleeping and TCBY that night.   Thursday Ill let you use your imagination, and yes, more TCBY.  Friday Mexico Day.  Yes, a quick jaunt into Mexico.  Also we saw the cacti at Saguaro National Park.  And driving, ended the day in Las Cruces New Mexico.  Saturday So driving through NM is boring.  The day ended in Amarillo Tx.  Some good bar b q and TCBY led us into bed time.  Oh yes, also I got to listen to the A's beating the rangers on rangers radio, that was fun.  Sunday Trinity Fellowship Church in Amarillo.  Rodger Hodges church, and if you don't know who Rodger Hodges, shame on you.  BTW Martin, he is the worship leader there.  So of course great praise and worship, Good message, then a 5 hour drive home.   So all in all it was a great trip.  Phoenix was a disappointment, my only plans were to see Bill Heaton, a local youth minister I once worked for, but our schedules never worked out for that to happen.  I must say it is great to be back home.  Even though the month started with two youth camps, only one was with "MY" group =), so I'm starting to feel separated from them (not necessarily saying that is bad).  Well, goodnight and remember, same bat time, same bat channel. (the really sad thing is that I continue that joke even though I doubt the target reads this.)
Ok, quick trip recap.  11 days 4 states 2 countries  And upon comming home  4 messages on the ansering machine over 4000 emails  Yes, 4000 emails.  Thats not a complete number, becuase I have had to send and recieve more than 2 times already to get them all (outlook crashes, believe it or not).  So if anyone needs me, Ill be checking email for the next three years.
urlLink ebay item #3924884114   Yes, the link above gives you the change to buy a napkin containing Alan Keyes sweat.  Now I love Alan Keyes as much as the next man, if the next man happens to be a close relative of Alan Keyes, but this is a little out there.  So I will not be bidding on this napkin, however that is good news if you wish to.  It will be that much cheaper  =).    And for those of you who don't follow links, the current price for this sweat stained napkin is $24.25.
urlLink Help on the way for bad dates  "they're fake "rescue" calls — now being offered by two cell phone providers, Cingular Wireless and Virgin Mobile USA"  "And bingo, the bad date is history.”  -------------------------------------- This explains a lot. For awhile now I have been trying to figure out why Martin uses cingular instead of T-mobile (which all the cool kids use). So the question is, who should tell his wife?  Also, I really love that second q
