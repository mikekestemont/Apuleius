"What have you been up to?" "Me? Not much really. Well.. I'm alright. Yeh." Nods. "I set up my own company... I have Yao and Ben working for me now. Hahaha.. Well Yao is my deputy and Ben.. You know, I don't actually know what Ben does. I think he's a toilet cleaner or something. Hmm.." "Oh. There's a Yao now, is there?" Adam says, clearly jealous and curious and annoyed. "He's just a deputy. It's a growing company. Yeh. It's called Google." she says proudly. "What's that?" "Do you have the internet?" "No." "OK then. Don't worry about it." Long awkward silence while Adam wonders what the hell Google is and whether Yao will be a threat. Jane thinks about Adam's hair. "You know.. I have to go now Adam. It was nice meeting you again." Jane starts getting up. "Um, can I have your number? Maybe I'll call you some time." Pause. "Er, sure." Jane scribbles her number down, secretly thinking abuot how she must NOT wait beside the phone as soon as she got back from her meeting. "Ok, bye then." "Bye."
At starbucks  "What do you want?" "Erm.. I'll have a latte." "Ok, two lattes please." "No, I'll pay for mine - " "Don't worry... I know I don't even have enough money to pay the rent but small things like this don't matter." "No, really." "No no no, I gotta pay you back for that ripped dress, right?" "Haha.. Ok then, just this time." "You mean there'll be another time?" Janey laughs.. rather embarrassedly, actually.  Adam scrounges around in his pockets. *Jingle jingle* "Oh crap. I've only got enough for one," he says rather sheepishly. Janey bursts out in laughter, like so: "AHAHAHAHAHA.. ahem. Don't worry, I'll pay for me. In fact I'll pay for both of us." Adam looks sheepish for the rest of the morning.
And then what happened? Well i'll tell you what happened. And i will try to make this as long as possible.  "You wanna grab a coffee some time?" "Err, sure!" "You know, I never quite got over when you stole my guitar. It kinda made me appreciate when i did have it. I almost died, you know." "Really? Well that was my favourite dress you know, it was Barbie." Adam laughs. --awkward silence--
Janey's pager rings. "Oh. I'm needed in the office." Ryan looks disappointed. "Maybe I'll catch you later then?" "Yeah, that would be best." "Dinner some time maybe?" "I guess," says Janey with a smug feeling inside. "I'll pick you up at 7-30 tonight then?" "Tonight?" "Are you busy?" "Well, no, but.." "Me neither," says Ryan. Janey laughs. "Alright then, tonight it is. Do you even know where I live?" "No. Are you gonna tell me?" Janey laughs again and tells him her address. "Really? I just live down the road!" "Seriously?" "Yeah! This is amazing! Wow!" "What number do you live at then?" "46." "Weird.." "I know! And you live at number 25!" "Hehe, listen, I've got to go now." "Alright, remember, 7-30!" Janey departs from Starbucks feeling h
