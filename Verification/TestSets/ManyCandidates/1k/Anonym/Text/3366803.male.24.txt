Remember Clark's 3rd Law. Sufficiently Advanced Technology is coming. If power is still assigned in the same ancient ways - screaming and displaying teeth - when any one of these technologies become available, then we can kiss it all goodbye. We're already in the middle of the 6th mass extinction event to occur in the entire 4 billion year history of the planet, give George Bush an assembler and I'd bet a lot that he would make the Great Dying (250 million years ago, 90% of the worlds species went extinct, probably due to a major asteroid impact) look like a mild cold. Or far worse, give him the key to real AI. He might even be stupid enough to think he could contain or control it. I suspect this illusion wouldn't last long, but it wouldn't have to.  Of course, given that we're too stupid to stop killing each other over who gets to live on one particular patch of 'holy' land, much less stop breeding like plague rats despite the rather blatant evidence that we have too many people already, what hope have we of any kind of rational, civilised approach to, well, anything really? What's worse is that the insanity holds even if not all the monkeys are insane. A sane monkey must be incredibly cautious about assuming another monkey is also sane, as mistaking a smooth talking lunatic for someone rational is practically a guarantee that the sane monkey will get screwed. So instead, we must assume everyone we meet to be mad until proven sane, and the screaching monkey hordes continue their insanity.   The Liberals are wrong. The Conservatives are just as wrong. The Libertarians come closer, but their Ayn Rand obsession is worrying. In theory, capitalism is a beautiful thing. In theory, communism is even more so. Neither one works too well in the real world. I would suggest a revolution, but they have this history of being hijacked by assholes who're solely interested in power and making the overall situation even worse. So instead, let's all pretend this shit doesn't exist, crank the music, and partake of our own individual drug(s) of choice. Hey, maybe if I get fucked up enough I'll overcome my crippling self-conciousness long enough to let go and dance.
If that doesn't arouse your sense of wonder (you do remember your sense of wonder, don't you?) then you  really  need to do something to break out of the rut you're in.  Get away from people. Make beautiful music. Go skydiving. Meditate. Drop acid. Learn quantum physics. It really doesn't matter what, just do  something  before your mind fossilises completely.
So I had an interview yesterday, it seemed to go well. The interviewers made appreciative noises, said 'good answer', all that stuff. Then they called me this morning to tell me they're giving the job to someone else.  Why am I not surprised?  You'd really think that after all these years I'd have learned not to get my hopes up... Oh well, poor, lonely and depressed seems to be my lot in l
