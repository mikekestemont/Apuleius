had since moving here has been tainted by a crazy neighbor experience.  My first apartment in New York featured two girls who decided to furnish their residence with a couch and nothing else to absorb sound.  Said freaks were also fond of gymnastics at 3am in the morning (I now insist upon a "No late night cartwheels from fellow tenants" clause in leases) and from the sounds of their footsteps were professional sumo wrestlers.  My next apartment featured an elderly Belgian woman who hated Shana and me.  Complaints ranged from our "noisy showering" to our "loud and disrespectful tossing and turning" at night.  We actually had to acquire legal help to prevent Belgium's answer to Satan from evicting us for such heinous crimes.  Though my prior apartment had quiet neighbors, I was fortunate enough to be awoken early weekend mornings to the sounds of an opera trilling homeless woman.  Who stood across the street from my bedroom window.  (Why aren't more homeless people mimes? Though I find them creepy and wish them to pretend they are in a box many kilometers away from me, there is something to be said for silence.)  Ah, well at least I had six months of quiet.  Now, where's my glow stick?
I was reading through the NY Times Sunday edition yesterday and happened upon the "Weddings" section. One of my former colleagues recently married, and I read the couple's announcement with interest. As I had nothing better to do, I skimmed through the rest of the announcements. Some were "garden variety" but others were of the "Who  are  these people?" variety. I happen to be proud of my accomplishments. Though I have not cured any diseases or founded any organization benefiting endangered, furry animals, I do have a great job, nice apartment and people who tolerate me. I'd say that I've done well. Some of the wedded couples featured in the paper were a bit on the ridiculous side. An example (or reasonable facsimile thereof) of one bride's background: "Mrs. X, 26, is the CEO of Citigroup in Manhattan. A Rhodes Scholar, she graduated summa cum laude thereafter from Harvard Law, having founded the Harvard Law Review at the age of 21. Prior to that, Mrs. X graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University with a double-major in Advanced Quantum Physics and Latin Classics and a minor in Ballet. A fluent speaker of 20 African dialects, she enjoys rescuing beached whales and mapping the human genome sequence, when she's not penning mystery novels." My god, did she ever make mud pies or read Nancy Drew? I am not belittling her achievements (I mean, how  could  I?), but these people scare me. I can easily picture her in a stark room trying to replicate nuclear fusion with salad tongs and a  urlLink Speak &amp; Spell  for fun when the experiment goes awry, reducing her to an insane freak with salad tongs for arms. The backgrounds of the parents of such people were just as freakish. I may be a three-toed sloth in comparison, but at least...I h
