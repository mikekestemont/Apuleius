guy and the receding stopped (for now).  Dad - Glad to see that your still thriving on the stress at work, but lets hope that the next Argyle season can keep that smile on your face a little bit longer before gravity (and Leeds Utd) take their toll.  I love you both so much but I could never tell you to your faces. You understand, don't you?
Well, its been a while and I thought I'd adopt a trick that Hitler used to use when giving public speeches - let them wait and they'll hang on your every word when you speak!  Continueing from where I left off, I had a huge surprise when I was walking down Poppies Lane 1. I bumped into Banny, a long lost chum from Ridgeway School. He was pretty unemotional but that's probably because I was embarassingly happy to see him! Honestly though, it is always nice to see a familiar face when you've been away for a long time.  While I've been staying at the Masa Inn, it has been under construction for some new rooms and stone and wood carvers have been busy applying their trades at amazing speeds. It worries me though to think about how much these people must be paid! To their credit, they have a clock on the workmans wall that I should have tried to buy off them as a souvenir.

As Far as the paragliding has been going - Lisa has now done 2 tandem flights and 6 solo flights! She has also accumulated a lot of bruises and when people ask her how she got them I jump in to say "she's got a big mouth - so I made her shut it!". Some people got the joke but some didn't.  I have also done a tandem flight which was another tick off the extreme sports list. It was a very liberating experience and I didn't seem to notice that I only had a sheet above my head - I thought I was just floating in mid air! It was good, but I would want more control over the paraglider to do it again.  On one day out to the paragliding site, a surfer on a motorbike, complete with board and girlfriend, crashed into a jeep right in front of us! I had to swerve to avoid running them over. Thankfully, no-one was hurt badly, but guess what the surfer did next - Did he check to see if his girlfriend was ok, or his s
