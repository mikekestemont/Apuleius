remember as much as I think I do? Will I get a good job? Will I have a job right out of school? Where will I have a job? I just hate having my life so out of my hands at the moment. All I can do is take one day at a time, one class period at a time, and do the best I can and hope I get where I'd like to be. I've never really failed before, and I don't expect to anytime soon. I also know that I have a lot of support from family and friends in everything I do. I just can't help these jitters.

It may not be 100% complete, but it's close as I can get for a Sunday morning. I am going to get a map and mark them all down, but for now I'll put them here. Eventually I'd like to take two good sized trips a year, on in summer and one at Christmas break, and fill in with little weekend stuff here and there to get them all in in my lifetime.
