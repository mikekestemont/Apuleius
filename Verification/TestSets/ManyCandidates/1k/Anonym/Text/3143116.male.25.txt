bad hair. Enough said!    Angels and Demons    Another amazing book by Dan Brown, author of  The DaVinci Code . His books make us take a good, hard look at the Roman Catholic Church and what it is really trying to teach. Although both books are fiction, the main points are terribly accurate. I highly recommend both books to anyone and everyone. It will really make you think twice the next time you walk into church.   The Catholic Church   ... is at it again.  A bishop in Oregon "has published a two-page "affirmation of faith" that requires lay ministers and cantors to accept the church's teachings against same-sex relationships, abortion, contraception and other issues if they want to keep their jobs." If this ever happens in Philadelphia I would have a tough decision to make: resign on principle or let the bastards keep paying me my salary every week while I laugh all the way to the bank!    My Boyfriend   I realize that I love Garland more each passing day. I love spending time with him, even if it's just sitting on the couch watching that fat moron, Tom Ridge talk about threats he really knows nothing about. I don't particularly like leaving him for long periods of time, but what can you do? We are nearing our sixth month anniversary later this week!    My Mom   I am very close to my mother, but not as close as I'd like to be. She is still adjusting to the whole gay thing ( I came out to her in April 2003). Whenever I spend time with her, I can feel the tension between us. No one else can feel that. I desperately want that turmoil to subside, but I realize there's not much I can do except give her the time she needs. It would be nice to be able to talk about Garland more openly and freely with her without fear of her wigging out. Time and patience, time and patience.    Hateful Rappers   There is a rapper out of Jamaica named "Beenie Man". His music instructs listeners to kill gays. No, I'm not kidding. "The music reflects how Jamaican people see it," he said. "I think there are things that are a part of Caribbean culture just like any other culture in the world. Everybody has their way of life. People have beliefs and that comes from who they are. The music come from that." Would people tolerate music that instructed listeners to kill African Americans (Southern Culture) or Jews (German Culture)??? This is just another attempt to rationalize homophobia as something we need to accept. Fuck off!    Spruce Street Singers   ...are singing the National Anthem at a Phillies game on August 9th. It's the ballclub's second annual gay day. Even the Phillies realize the power of the (Gay) almighty dollar!  Well that certainly is enough for now. Amazingly, I have much more that I would like to write. All that will have to wait for another time as I'm very tired and in need of sleep! Have a great week!  u
