do they have to be so dificult to me?? They don't get the point that I'm tired of living with other people and I wanna live by myself!   I have a very sad life!! What is sadder than not having our own life to live? What is sadder than not being able to make our own decision of life? What is sadder than to live a life based on other's people rules and regulation? What is sadder than not having the freedom to live? I think at this very moment, my life is the sadest life of all.. :(
5 days to go.. and we've screwed things up! I knew this was gonna happen! We see each other last Friday.. things got a lil bit messy.. we kinda had a fight. And as usual.. I'm having difficulty dealing with it. I'm in my silent mood. Don't feel like arguing or yelling.. so I decided to stay silent this time.  Frankly.. I'm not very sure wether&nbsp;I should be looking forward to 31st July or not. But i'm definitely tired of having this kinda blue feeling. I'm having a very horrified moment dealing with my life at this very moment. I don't think I can handle another pain in my ass!
Starting next week, I'll be starting out my diet again. Just like how I did last year. I hope this time I'll be able to reach my target weight. I should also go for my swimming routine every week now. And not forgetting my yoga for all those stretching.
The new era of my life has already begun. I'm finally had the opportunity to life my life my own way. The excitement was terrific! I did the house cleaning not having to worry the mess that nobody will make. Cleaning the house and cooking somehow is becoming my new hobby..hahaha  And of course.. the babysitter part.. He's no longer needed since I've invited my long lost friend to live with me. So.. that part was settle.. Eventhough I didn't had the chance to live alone.. but I have my privacy.. still. As for my lil cousin that I thought I was supposed to babysit on some days of the week.. Well.. no actually.. only sometimes when both her parents is stuck with something.  About last weekend house ruling.. I was a bit pissed of with my aunt.. But I've decided to lay calm and just live with her attitude. Like the Malay said.. 'Just close one eye ler' this coming weekend.. my mom will be in town.. Hmm.. I guess.. I don't really feel that she has moved to East Malaysia. As for me.. she's just out of town for some business trip.. :P Nothing much change between me and her.. still the same kind of relationship..  This coming weekend.. another hectic day coming since my brother will be in town and performing at ntv7 again. I really am not the type that will attending some mini concert. All those cheering raising hands.. It's just not me..hahaha We'll see what will happen this coming w
