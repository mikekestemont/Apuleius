ask a question.             The catch, of course, is that it wasn’t easy.  It’s hot out there, it’s the wilderness.  The risk taken in approaching the limo is not exactly negligible.  Why do it?  Well, there’s that whole thing where Jesus tells us to go, baptize, proclaim, etc.  If that isn’t convincing enough, there’s also the Book of Order, which states that the First of the six Great Ends of the Church is “the proclamation of the gospel for the salvation of humankind.”              Does that mean we have to be Jehovah’s witness-like evangelists, knocking on doors, or like the University Bible Fellowship, accosting people with one-on-one Bible Study opportunities?  Not exactly.  Many of us probably don’t normally invite the Jehovah’s witness into our home for tea.            Proclaiming the gospel doesn’t have to be hard, scary, or insensitive.  As Christians our duty is to live the gospel, to proclaim it with our lives as well as our words.  Sometimes all it takes is asking the question, being with someone, or responding a certain way to a situation. But sometimes it is hard, sometimes we have to put ourselves on the line.  Embodying the gospel happens in so many ways, and anyway Jesus never seemed to worry about his personal safety program.  That’s why there are people protesting every afternoon on Columbia Drive—they are using their bodies AND their words to proclaim what they see in the gospel.  That’s why there are people tutoring children every day after school, visiting kids in the projects and taking them out of that environment for day trips so they can see their potential, reading textbooks onto tapes for disabled students, volunteering at the Central Night Shelter.  Sure, it can be dangerous—sometimes bodily, sometimes to our ego, our self-image, our public image, or at least our self-righteousness.  It’s a wilderness road, at noon, and someone is waiting in that chariot just ahead.             As Christians, and as pastors, our duty is to lead people in the wilderness to water, and enable those people to do the same for others.  When Philip and the eunuch came up out of the water and Philip suddenly disappeared, the eunuch could have thought, “that was a nice dip on a hot afternoon,” or maybe, “great, I’m dripping, people are staring, and that guy is gone.  What now?”  But he went on his way rejoicing—like the benediction says, we are to go on our way rejoicing in the power of the Spirit….this is not the rejoicing I was doing when the UBF people finally left me.  Meanwhile, Philip was suddenly relocated!  He doesn’t appear to miss a beat—he proclaims the gospel at all times.  We can do that too.  Though we are, of course, to live the gospel in our daily lives, it is when we proclaim the gospel in all its fullness that we are most vulnerable, and most supported by the Spirit.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.
Here I shall be posting copies of all my sermons, hopefully archived by text, over the next few weeks--and as sermons are written/preached, of course!  E
