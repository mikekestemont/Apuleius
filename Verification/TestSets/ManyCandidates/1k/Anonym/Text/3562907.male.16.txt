all just chilled at my crib for a little while when Edna called Richie again and invited him and me to go to Mimi's.  1) I didn't want to go to Mimi's and 2) I didn't want to see brittney and have this whole ordeal start up again so I said I wasn't going.  Brett and Richie ended up meeting them there and Richie told me how boring it was and that he shouldn't have gone and stuff, so I felt better.  The next day, yesterday, Saturday, I went to church, which is where we usually meet up for the day and then decide what we're doing and Brittney was there.  I decided I was going to say hi but she was just talking to Richie and never even looked at me.  Afterwards I was talking to Richie and she came up and asked him what we were doing that day.  I told her we were hittin up ChinaTown and she went on about how gross it was or something and so Richie and I started heading for the cars when brett called me and asked if he could come.  I said sure and went to pick him up when Richie called and said Brittney wanted us to go to Spaghetti Factory with them for lunch.  I decided it would be all right and we all met up and Jenna's house, then left from there.  We talked like usual and Brittney was kind of trying to flirt with me but I didn't really pay attention to it.  After that, she asked what we were all doing and I said we were gonna go swimming at brett's.  She had to do something for about an hour too and she asked "so is this goodbye? or are we gonna do something later?"  I quickly said "goodbye" and she just said all right and we left.  LAter that night, Richie was gonna go to class night and hang out with edna and brittney called me and asked me to go.  I said I'd meet em there but wasn't sure if i was going to stay.  It cost 2 bucks to get in and I didn't have any money so I headed for the car after talking for a couple minutes and brittney ran over and grabbed my arm and started pulling me so i decided to stay.  I sat next to Brittney during the show and she was leaning on me and stuff but i never acted on it.  AFter the show we were gonna go to Wendy's but it was closed so we all just kind of left without much of a goodbye.  And then today (Sunday) I just hung out with Brandon and Richie all day, we usually don't see the girls on sunday anyway.  And that's the story of me and Brittney over the past month with some details omitted.  I know this thing is lllooooonnnnggggg. But I wanted to tell that story and I'll keep this blog updated about how things with me and this strange, interesting, beautiful girl g
