the 22. I'll miss Margaret, I know. but it will be okay. we decided today that we'll celebrate christmas on the 26. that works out well since it's our 3 month anniversary that day. it's so boring at work today. there's not really anything to do. I'm sure I could "find" something to do, some "menial" task that some 16year old monkey could perform more than sufficiently. what a waste of my time. God, I hope this claim adjuster thing works out, and that it's something I can take pleasure in doing. I need to lose some weight too. it looks like a swallowed an elf for crying out loud! I think the main thing is I need to stop drinking so much pop. it's so bad for me. let's go through the different jobs I've had...  renk corn detassler 3 days seasonal cornfest(manual labor, runner) 3 times seasonal warming house supervisor 3 mo seasonal bike shop(mechanic) 3 wk poor work environment, wasn't taught needed information/sufficiently grocery bagger and stock associate 3 yr left for school library 1 yr stopped attending platteville lemstone(retail sales assoc) 3 wk nsf busse car wash(vacuumed cars) 6 wk nsf office max(sales assoc, sales clerk) 7 mo went home from school(school year ended) mccullough(office staff) 1 1/2 yr moved old navy(retail sales assoc) 9 mo went home from school(school year ended) windy city(shipping manager, rental assoc, manual labor) 15mo nsf, poor working environment, not taught sufficiently to do job with excellence ??? claim adjuster ???

It's nice to have a day off.  I'm going down to navy pier with margaret and a couple of friends to see libido funk circus. it's this band margaret saw a couple years ago and really wants me to see them.  memorial day was good. lots of food and drink and time spent with good friends; always a good experience.  I have to hit the road...
starting over has become a new pastime for me.   in some form or another I seem to be...  starting over with margaret. starting over with God. starting over with my band. starting over with music. starting over with on-line diary-dom. starting over with a new address. starting over with friends I haven't talked to in too long. trying to start over with a new job. not having any luck.(though that may be changing. please God make it clear) and I always seem to be starting over with my finances.  ...hopefully I can learn to keep on and stop taking a mulligan on everything over and a
