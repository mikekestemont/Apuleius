thought I try something a little different and post a collage of some musicians I like and respect.
I know its been a minute since I posted, but thought i would just post a verse I heard today while listening to my MP3's:   " Subliminal hypnotism and colonialism, leaves most niggaz dead or in prison "   Jeru the Damaja Return of the Crooklyn Dodgers, 1995   I've heard this verse many times, but just today I realize what was really being said.  It made me think about how much hate there is toward people of color in this world, particularly africans and people of african decent.  European colonialism carved up the continent of africa, raped it of its natural resources(oil, diamonds, gold, etc.), kidnaped it's people and more recently stood aside and watched as the continent is being destroyed by tribal warfare, genocide(Rwanda) and AIDS.  And as for Subliminal hypnotism, just turn on the TV, like i have mentioned before the only in previous posts, more that likely the only programs you'll see blackfaces on 1 of 4 type of programs:  1. Playing ball on a sports program 2. Thuging/dancing/degrading black women on videos 3. Shucking and jiving comedy shows or movies 4. Wanted for a crime or looking ignorant while giving a statement on the news  All of which present subliminal(negative) images to (black)viewers:(
There are a few things in today's society that I am really starting to question and making me wonder what's REALLY going on???  unplanned/teen pregnancies  This is a phenomenon I can't figure out, I know there are different cases and circumstances for everyone. And not everyone believes in abortion, but I would think in today's society everyone would believe in contraceptive or be more responsible.  Condoms are sold in all drug stores and are free at clinics, and birth control in available(even to the uninsured).  So I don't see why there is such a high rate of teen/single mother/unplanned pregnancies.  AS far as teens go, I understand that parents cannot be with their children 24/7, but I would think they would talk to their children about contraceptives and/or safe sex.  And I know that "mistakes" do happen sometimes, but how can a grown women or man make the same mistakes 2 or 3 times over.  You would think after making a "mistake" once they would get on birth control or be faithful users of condoms.     Lack of education  Last time I checked public schools were free to everyone in this country, but yet there are still people to this day that can't read or write and don't have a high school diploma.  I don't understand how people can chose to drop out of school in the 11th grade, you only have a year left!!!  And even if your a slow learner they have FREE programs in public schools that can help you.  So in my opinion there is no excuse for anyone not to have a high school diploma and/or to be illiterate, when education(k-12) is free to everyone in America, regardless of their race, gender, SES or r
