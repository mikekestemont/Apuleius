the expression on her face made me so happy :>. We mad it to the movies and we chose " The Day after tomorrow". It turned out to be an alright movie and just to share the experience with her was magical. We proceeded to walk home and I learned just so much more of her personality it was great. She likes everything that I do so its pretty crazy.  I dropped her off at her house and that's how it ended with us making plans to hangout again.   I walked home and watched the rest off Game 6 Calgary vs. Tampa Bay and it ended in 2OT with a bad result( You'll Get them In 7 Calgary) I went to bed after the hockey game and entered the depths of my dreams when I was thinking of how incredible the night was.
