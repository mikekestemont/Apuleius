on the Great Barrier Reef, climbed a big rock called Uluru in the middle of the desert, went on lots of hikes, saw many amazing sites, read many Bill Bryson books, finally finished reading Richard Dawkin's  The Selfish Gene  (highly recommended), finally read  Flat Lander , and generally very much enjoyed myself.   Taking that long of a time away from work and my normal day to day life allowed for time to reflect on what I am doing and where I want to go with my life. In short, I pretty much figured out what I knew before the trip, I don't want to keep doing this job and I want to figure out what else to do. I didn't figure what else to do, but at least I have grown more comfortable with the idea of being ok with whatever comes after this. I don't expect to make a huge success of things with anything that come after this job as I once hoped to. I am more or less fine with doing whatever sounds remotely more satisfying or productive. I am still very much considering going back to school to get a Masters in physics or physical sciences, an MBA, or a Teacher's credential, but if those fall to the way side, I am sure something else will come up. I just hope this laissez faire attitude is able to beat back the day to day stresses of this job and researching other opportunities. That is the problem for me about discovering opportunities, it stresses me out. I always worry about the what-ifs and the opportunity costs and whatever... I am too good at cultivating the negative point-less-stresses. Sigh...   That was quite long... Surprised myself there I did. Speak like Yoda I sometimes do.    (I just used the spellchecker, and besides this blogger having the worst spell checker I have everused, I also noticed that it doesn't even recognize the word "blog".)
I am in Boston (actually Walmath, but you probably didn't know where that was) for a month for work. While searching for my hotel (the streets here are horrendous) I was listening to a radio talk show on some AM station... The show was about lobsters, and fisherman's and scientist's discoveries about lobsters. During the show I realized what would be the perfect job for me; I should learn pointless useless facts and forget them again. I love doing that. Listening to random crap on the radio, or reading an obscure (but well written) book, or whatever... But then... This is key... I forget so much of what I learn. See, I learned all about lobster's sex life, scientist's recent methods of studying the lobsters, fisherman's method of tagging the lobsters, and a bunch of other facts that I can't tell you about because I have forgotten most of it. I somehow don't think this is going to be all that marketable... Ok, off to the internet to learn some more obscure and immediately forgotten trivia. Maybe I should spend more time thinking about my career goals t
