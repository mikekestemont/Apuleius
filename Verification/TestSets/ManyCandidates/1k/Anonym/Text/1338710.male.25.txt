Well,  I am off to the beach. Me and the girly are heading to Gulf Shores. It's time for white sands, golf, brews, and a cheeseburger in paradise. Of course we will be listening to Jimmy Buffet. Wish you all could come. So do not be expecting any blogs or email. Please refrain from calling the cell if possible. ----unless you are calling to tell me i got a song cut, or that i won a mill-iaahhh-ion dollars.  Beunos dias,  Adam
Somehow I do this everyday though. To many good computer games and DVD's to enjoy. Now that I got IM its even worse. Oh yeah, my IM is adambrowder. It is an ichat account.  I'll be in Nashvegas tomorrow. Looking forward to a good meeting hopefully.  One of these days I am going to figure out how to actually post mp3's and pics.  Later
Well, I'm a total cyber geek now. I have an  AIM account, actually I-chat. Same thing though. Anyways......What a rainy weekend here in Northwest Alabama. Played a gig yesterday in searing humidity, then I got rained on. Lots of fun. Today went to go watch a great band(cadencemusic.net), some friends of mine play at a July 4th thing. Of course it rained and it was pretty nasty. I have this problem now, it's NOT like local celebrity, it's more like, I can't go some where without people knowing what I do. So I got ropped into judging a radio station talent contest thing.  "Mr.S" Handed me a sheet and said here man judge this thing for me I gotta go do a soundcheck. It was atleast "entertaining" in a humorus way. Anyways, gotta go. I gotsta drive to Nashville and work tomorrow.  "I don't know, 9"  Adam
On my way back from Huntsville tonight, my girl and I see a wreck. Some guy crashed his truck in a ditch. I role my window down and ask if he's ok. He looks fine. He says "no" then walks to Erin's side and opens the door. That makes me mad. I'm about to ahnilate this guy when he says "man can you give me ride, I gotta get outa here before the cops show up". I told him no. That's clearly his problem and not mine. I especially don't need a drunk guy laying in the back of my truck. Thankfully he shuts the door before I throw it in gear and pull off.  I would have locked the doors had I expected that! I hope he went to jail.
I'M IN PRINCE RUPERT, CANADA, EH!    LATER, e
