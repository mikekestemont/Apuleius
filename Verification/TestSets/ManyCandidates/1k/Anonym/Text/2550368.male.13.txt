so I downloaded a trail and yes it is the r0x0r! It is so much more stable then Zend and is not FREAKING JAVA (I HATE JAVA) so theres a plus right there. It comes with lots of documentation and the editor area is very nice. The CVS intergration IS SOOOOOOOOO NICE!! I regret ever learning comandline CVS now that I can just right click on the file and do updates, commits, edit locks, you name it (and it has to do with CVS) and PhpED does it! If I had the cash I would buy it!  Tomarow (Well today) Mike Z and maby Matt and I decided to go to rinky dink (batting cadges, go carts, mini gold, etc..) so we should have a tits time and I will most likley walk away with a few more colored golf balls :)  Screw y'all, Jeff
