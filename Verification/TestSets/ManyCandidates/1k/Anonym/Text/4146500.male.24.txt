easier to remove them when i go pee or shit.  Haizzzz.....  Anyway, the reason why I created this blogger account, is because I can't leave a comment on Xiaxue's blog site if I'm not a member.  Don't know who Xiaxue is?  Haha, search for her in Blogger, and be prepared to have a great time :)  I only discovered it like a few days ago, and I proceeded to read every single one of her entries dated from April '03 till now... I think she's freaking funny :D!!  Keke, I wonder what Boon Lay Girl will say if she knows this :P....  And since I've created the account, I thought I might as well leave some words in my blog.  Haha, I'll probably get sick of doing it some time tomorrow, but who cares ;)  Anyway, I've got bad experiences with diaries.  I first started mine like 10 years ago when I was in Sec 2 (when I was 14, for the uninitiated), and promptly discarded it when i reached Sec 3 because I couldn't stand the mushy rubbish I wrote about some crush I had.  It made me cringe.  But I think I must have really enjoyed writing such mushy rubbish because I started again when I was in Sec 4.  Or maybe, that's because I had another crush then, whatever....  Again, I discarded that second diary around 3 years later.  This time, it was because that particular diary made me feel kinda sad when I read through the past entries.  I don't like to dwell on sad events.  Plus, I got so many terrible secrets in that thing, it's just gonna be a disaster if it fell into the wrong hands.  Like what happened to my sister's when i peeked on hers (keke....).  Anyway, here's a self-into, taken directly from my Friendster site:   A perpetual dreamer with the uncanny ability to make my friends laugh... at myself :D!! They think my life's a joke!! Heehee... can't really argue with that sometimes ;)....       Anyway, just surfing thru a few profiles here have made me realise just how OLD-SCHOOL i am :P.... I no longer have any interest in clubbing, and i think beach volleyball is a crappy waste of time for wannabes (kidding :D!)... and who else would list XIANGQI, of all things, as one of his interests in life?!?!? Darn I feel like an ah-pek... keke, quarter life crisis ;)       I can't cycle, can't blade, and never did managed to 'serve' that stupid badminton thingy in my entire life. I enjoy indulging in nostalgic stuff from the lost '80s, attempting in vain to make up for my deprived childhood ;) Sheese... you really have to ask my girl girl what she sees in me :D!       Oh, and my fav food is pork chops... Yum Yum :P..!! Come to think of it, also rojak (toa payoh kopitiam version). And char kway teow. Not forgetting french fries dipped in hot melted cheese. Er... a lot of 'favorites' lah!   Ok ok, I know it's kind of crappy and corny, but nevermind ;
