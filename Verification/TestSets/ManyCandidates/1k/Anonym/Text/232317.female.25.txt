introducing myself?
Confusing, I'm sure. I'm not sure about the lack of paragraphs this setting has created for me, I might log in and change it soon. Work whinge approaching >>> I just can't believe how idiotic my boss is. I wonder how many people around the world can say that? I can't believe some of the things this man does. What is an appropriate name for him? Any ideas anyone? Please leave comments if you can think of a handle. I can't leave any real info about him. I'm too afraid of defamation!!!! Anyways, he's a tosser and that's pretty much all he is.
Anyways, I'd better leave it at that.
Angus is so lovely, he's just emailed me with this link on travel and stuff in Japan. >>>

I'll have to have a good look at it later, because I'm at work now.
Taking a tour around Tokyo on the net, everything seems quite good - people are saying that it's not as expensive as rumours have it.

And installing blog this! onto mum and dad's computer - how else would i get by? it's getting too late to be blogging, but i just needed to post that link in case i forget the place names. it's going to be pretty hard getting around tokyo... oh well. i'll survive, i'm such a big girl.
So, there was this tennis coach at a private school in the city. he fancied a 14 year old girl, who fell under his charms. until she was 18 years old. she's now come 'out of the woodwork' to charge the man with having an underage affair (not rape?) and she won in court yesterday. he goes to prison for this last night! i saw in the paper that the jury had more women than men in it, but does this matter. 14 years old isn't an adult, she wouldn't haven't had had a clue. I think you tend to think that you know what's going on then, at that age, but if a teacher (someone in authority) takes that relationship further - that's pretty bad.
There was a young woman with this man in the paper too (walking with him last night on the news) and how would that feel like? A man you're walking with has taken guidence and responsiblity and thrown it away and mistreated trust. A man (maybe she was a sister and not a girlfriend?) you know has (ages ago) done that.
hmmm.
Vanessa from work is so fun and she's very helpful. Lucky I called her just now to help out on a story, because her friends have just got back from Tokyo and used this site as a guide before they went>>>  urlLink superfuture .
yippee. I can't wait to go (less than two weeks to go - more like ten days!) and now i'll be able to check this site o
