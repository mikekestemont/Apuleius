Woohoo getting my nails done tomorrow! I hope the look good.. i've never had my nails done professionally before.. haha im like a professional nails virgin! Otay i have nuthing else to say haha, for once =O Tata   Oh score i've known dave for a year.. time flys!!! =)
Performing baybee YEYAH! I'm on a mega high right now! Just did 2 shows and man.. I love performing!!! =D=D=D=D=D hehe im so happy right now and today in our lunch break we went shopping.. i bought THE most BEAUTIFUL ring! its absolutley gorgeous! its like (fake) silver and its kina like lattices of silver in a band, then in the lil figure of 8's that the latices make there's grey diamantes alternated diagonally with black obsidian ones i LOVE it!! its quite possible one of my favourite pieces of jewelry  i have ever bought! WOOHOO i had starbuks today !! White Chocolate Mocha! today was just an all round WICKED day and im fucking stoaked!! haha my makeup was hillarious.. i actually looked like a showgirl/prostitute haha  okay ima go cause this is my 2nd post of the day haha TOODOOLOO!! xoxoxoxox Cathy "CoLuMbIa"   P.s.. Michael Murphy off nz idol still catches the bus around town..  makes ya think if he's ACTUALLY famous... hmm =P hehe
Kia Ora! Bonjour! Ola! Hellew!  Just felt like doing that, YAY HOLIDAYS!!! woohoo! although it doesnt really feel like holidays just yet because I'm performing today/tonight and also cause i had a rehersal last night, Rehersal was pretty wicked (believe it or not!)I made friends with pretty much everyone there haha mind you thats not that hard considering we all have a basic interest of performing etc so like whenever you have an awkward silence you can talk about drama... and then eventually get on to the topic of lesbian  dancing/kissing scenes... Samboka (im not sure if i can spell that yet) and also many many MANY other very random topics that only whacked out performing people who have been stuck in a room with no air con-fucking-ditioning with other whacked out performing people for like 5 hours can talk about! Great! Hmm today im performing.. TWICE! haha i hope my voice doesn't pack out in the middle of a song! *Runs to my pantry to take ALL the cough lollies* Oh i have my period.. got it last night.. which i am surprisingly happy about.. cause this means it wont just randomly pop up on me on the night of  the ball.. which would really suck cock in a big way! Alright i better  get going.. shower.. get my ass in  to town... rehearse.. perform.. shop.. perform.. go home!! :D and hopefully talk to dave.. but meh :p he'll  most likely be out! Toodooloo! x
