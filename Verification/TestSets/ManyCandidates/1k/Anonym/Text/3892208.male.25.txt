go of our resentment frees us from placing blame on them and allows us to look toward ourself for peace. Still, in the end it does not justify the action. What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   ~Ralph Waldo Emerson
Music...Nothing like music to capture a moment, maybe its just an innate ablity I possess that lets me remember certain things.&nbsp; This may be bad, it may be good.&nbsp; I can think of hundreds of times that music has lent itself to a certain situation or high point or low point in my past.   Take Sat night for instance.&nbsp; I'm hanging out with someone that tells me they are a fan of the Indigo Girls, so I throw some on.....big mistake.&nbsp; After about the 3rd song, I get a flashback.......YOU'RE BAGS ARE AT THE TARTANA!!!&nbsp; I get this flashback to the hour long singalong to any Indigo Girls song that was available at that moment in the hotel room, which kinda ruined the mood for me this weekend.   If you haven't already, now would be a good time to enter in a "you need to stop living in the past, Dan."   And to that, I say "fuck&nbsp;that".&nbsp; Movies have soundtracks, no reason why I can't have my own.
urlLink     Just wanted to take a moment to think of my grandfather and all he gave to everyone in his life, I can't believe it's been two years since he was taken from us.  We love you, Dziadz.  And on a different note:  How is it that the only picture I find of my grandfather on the Internet is one of him standing over a Nazi soldier that he most likely killed about 30 minutes before this picture was taken?  R.I.P.
So the driver came to pick us up at 6, show started at 8 but we figured we could drink and hangout there for an hour or so before he came out to play...    urlLink     After several rounds of $8 beers and several trips to the bathroom, it was time for the show to begin........      urlLink      2nd row seats, damn. I didn't even need to use the zoom on the camera for that pic of him, we were so damn close to the stage. We were right there, good times! For real, I'm pretty sure I was getting out of hand, even worse than  "PLAY MILLION DOLLAR$!" . Mayer doesn't get his props as a guitarist, but he should b/c he can play his ass off! Best date ;) EVER!!  I was planning on meeting someone for his private show at Shuba's afterwards, but I literally passed out in the car on the way back. Our driver was totally south side, but God bless her for letting us rip 'em! I guess the show afterwards was awesome, all blues and only one of his originals. It didn't matter, the concert was plenty for me.     And also, Keith Urban rules. Take your space and take your reasons, but You'll Think Of Me.
