me luck!) followed by the Vengeance pre-release in two weeks. Hopefully all goes well..
Just wanted to describe how I've been feeling lately and I think this song says it best: Enjoy!   Lately I find myself out gazing at stars Hearing guitars like someone in love Sometimes the things I do astound me Mostly whenever you're around me  Lately I seem to walk as though I have wings And to sing like someone in love Each time I look at you I'm light as a cloud And feeling like someone in love  Sometimes the things I do astound me Mostly whenever you're around me  Lately I seem to walk as though I have wings Run into things like someone in love Each time I look at you I'm light as a cloud And feeling like someone in love Like someone in love Like someone in love
Just had an extremely intense LAN Call of Duty session, have not LANned for ages.  Johan and Loco are with me, so of course I got shot more times than I care to remember. But it was amazingly fun but Vasily Zaitsev I am not.  What else happened? Watched Bruce Almighty this afternoon. It was an okay movie, but of course, one would think that if he was given the same powers, he should be able to balance everything out properly. Mogwai (Shaz's cat) added some more battle scars on my skin.  I just re-read my previous post, and have to admit I was on an unnatural high. It's amazing how what some people say can affect me deeply.  I am still high. High on life!! I expect to fall at some point, but no worries.  Quote from Sandman:  It is sometimes a mistake to climb to the top It is always a mistake never to make the attempt.  I will keep on climbing!
Doctor's prescription:  Too much of the above leads to an eventual biting of the ass by reality. Reality bites, indeed.  One of my favourite associated taglines was and still is Living On Imagination. I believe imagination is what keeps me going, keeps me alive, keeps me sane in the real world. Sometimes we are too burdened with expectations. Could have, would have, all possibilities, anything could happen why do I worry so much.  Dreams? 'Dream to have a journey... Have me to hug you... Have you to be free.. Do what we want to do...' Sorry, I have to steal that from you dearest, but this is arguably one of the best phrases anyone's ever given to me.  I am incredibly happy!!! I am walking on air!!!! I am going crazy!!! And somehow I don't care!!! I am flying above!!! Stop me if you dare!!! I am in love!!! More than I can bear!!!   If the future be a myth, let the present be full of life.  Lastly, a Bjork song extract:  violently happy 'cause i love you violently happy but you're not here violently happy come calm me down before i get into trouble  If this be a dream, don't wake me u
