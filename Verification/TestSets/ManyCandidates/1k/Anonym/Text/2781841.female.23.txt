 But this time we thought we would be adventurous and try this  urlLink one.  Ian and Eleanor had driven to it and figured it was about an 8 hour canoe trip, which was reasonable with these kids. However, we had failed to do it ourselves and had no idea really where along the shoreline the park was.   So off we went Wednesday morning at 7am. At about 3pm, after 8 hours of canoeing, the kids were starting to get hungry and tired. We had taken 6 canoes, and so it had ended up that the 3 canoes with 3 people in it had rafted together and we had made sails (out of tarps and paddles) and we just sailing along. But the 3 canoes with only 2 people in each canoe had rafted together and were not doing so well. Those of us in the 'Viking Ship' had failed to realize who was left behind, Ian and R, the camper from hell. Not because he was a bad ass, but because we was extremely ANNOYING!! And Ian was the one out of all the leaders who had the hardest time delaing with him. As well as for the fact that the other 2 campers where the ones who gave R a hard time every move he made. It made for 2 very different experiences for the campers. Those in the Viking Ship (my canoe group) had a time of laughter and bonding, where the other group had a time of frustration, anger and tears.   Our canoe group thought since we had to stop for food and a rest we would head to this beautiful beach. Not too long, the other group caught up to us and had a rest as well. It was another Provincial Park called James N. Allan park. The only problem with it was that it was day use only and so we couldn't stay there. So we had a break, a swim and played some duck, duck, kill while I made some phone calls (yay for cell phones!) about whether or not we could stay there...but thanks to our wonderful government, you can't get a hold of anyone and then with our locaiton and the cell....we decided we better be off and searching.  So we canoed for 2 more hours and found a nice part of the shore where we pulled up and made dinner (yay freezed dried frenzy!) and slept and were up the next morning for a 5 hour paddle to Selkirk Provincial. We got there after lunch and spent the afternoon resting about and just having fun. Then the next day we canoed back to camp and treated the kids to a movie viewing of Pirates of the Carribean.  The week was really, really fun and the kids had a great time. It was awesome to do this camp with a bunch of leaders who are my friends. It went really smoothly and we had 2 days of sunshine!! A first for Intents camp!!!
