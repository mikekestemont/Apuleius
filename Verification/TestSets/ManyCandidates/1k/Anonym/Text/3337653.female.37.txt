Monday we took him sailing; Tuesday we forced him to watch Finding Nemo; Wednesday he raced sailboats with Phil, Scott, et. al; and last night we took him to Cedar P0int. All the while keeping him well-lubricated with Budweiser. 'Cos we're cool like that. The week has gone by  much  too quickly and I will be sad  to see Kev go. The good news, however, is that his college is less than an hour away, so we'll be able to go down during soccer season and watch him play. Yay! So. Now that I've recovered from the embarassment that was the M0rning Mix, I'm off to record my shift for tomorrow. Cya!
