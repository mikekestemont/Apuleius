that's all i want.  i don't even want the sort of boyfriend that i hafta call 4x a day.  i want men that i talk to regularily and enjoy goin out w/an spendin time with.  fuck this marriage crap.  i don't believe in forever, so y would i ask for it or offer it up?  maybe later.  but not now.  till i change my mind i will enjoy my solitude and treasure every quiet morning....
Hey bro, take it slow You ain't livin' in a video You're flying low with a high velocity No doubt, you're stressin' out That ain't what rock n' roll's about Get off that one way trip down lonely street  Now I know you've been kicked around You ain't alone in this ugly town You stick a needle in your arm You bite the dust, you buy the farm  CHORUS Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid What ya tryin' to do Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid They win you lose Hey, hye, hey, hey, hey stoopid  C'mon girl, it's a better day Get your foot out of that grave Don't let that one love tear your world apart C'mon babe, kick that stuff Show the street it ain't so tough Quit lyin' around with a crippled, broken heart  Now I know you've been seeing red Don't put a pistol to your head sometimes your answer's heaven sent Your way is so damn permanent  CHORUS  This ain't your daddy talkin' You know, I know Your story ain't so shocking You know, I know Blow some steam C'mon and scream  CHORUS  ~Alice Cooper Hey Stoopid~
ugh, i'm so annoyed right now.  i hafta keep believin that thangs will get better.   but even that doesn't stop things from suckin rite now.  i hate being broke as shit.  i don't know how i'm makin my car payment(s), my cell phone bill is massively overdue, and i'm depressed.  i'm not happy w/the way things are now.  i feel like shit.  mentally and physically.  i'm dreading goin to mrs. foster and askin for a loan.  but i don't know what else to do.  i wanna go back camping.  i don't wanna deal w/all of this.  i don't wanna care 'bout my future, today or yesterday.  i wouldn't mind stayin drunk for a few more weeks 'cuz then i wouldn't give a shit...  but i can't... so back to the real world and back to stress and headaches...
