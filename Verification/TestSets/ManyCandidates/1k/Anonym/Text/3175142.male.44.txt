Bible?  At least people don't get the gallows for translations in the vernacular anymore.  I can't wait for my local library to put a copy on the New Books shelf.
Comedy break--go see some  urlLink really funny 666 humor .  This funny post has earned  urlLink The Mighty Barrister  a spot on the blogroll.
urlLink Catholic Analysis  has a short post  urlLink responding to some basic arguments  in favor of gay marriage.  Here's a sample paragraph:   The response to these arguments is similar to the response to those who claim that one can't deny Communion to pro-abortion politicians because one can't judge the soul of the politician. In neither controversy is anyone asking a human being to judge the soul of another human being. We are speaking about objective, social facts and behavior. We are saying that the objective situation contradicts the truth and so announce to all in society that this behavior is to be avoided.    He does note that "[t]he struggles of a person with same-sex attractions are to be judged only by Christ," which shows at least a glimmer of empathy.  But when he says "we are called to consider marriage as the foundation of society, the fundamental cell of society," he doesn't realize that cuts both ways.  Gays argue that they deserve access to marriage for that very reason--because it is so important and foundational.  If marriage is good for America, then transforming gay liasons into gay marriages shouldn't be a bad thing, their argument goes.
urlLink Meet Joe Convert  posts the occasional reflections of an Evangelical turned Catholic.  For example,  urlLink Joe was appalled  by his recent visit to a California congregation which billed itself as "a Vatican II community."  Try visiting Hollywood (way beyond Vatican II) and that congregation will seem pretty conservative again, Joe.  But do come back for another visit.   urlLink Relapsed Catholic  is another personal blog about Catholicism.  I think the title suggests one who was lapsed but now has "unlapsed" back into activity as a practicing Catholic.  You might check out her post on  urlLink imprecatory prayer , which will give you a nifty new term to use in your Sunday School class as well as some really choice prayer phrases to impress your hockey team with.
I intend this to be an ecumenical blog offering interesting comments and open discussion on interesting religious questions.  Comments are always welcome and encouraged, and will only be edited if they are offensive or profane.   1-Your first blog?  A-No  but this is my first Blogger weblog (having done Radio and Typepad in the recent past), so I will spend the first few days learning how to make sidebar links and generally fix up the place using the Blogger template.     2-What exactly is the goal of Christian Inquiry?  A-Initially, to assemble a list of links of personal or group blogs, five or ten per denomination, that have a similar approach to blogging on religion--interested in asking questions and inquiring, rather than witnessing or doing apologetics.   3-Who are you?  A-Just a regular guy.  See "About Me" on the sidebar.  E
