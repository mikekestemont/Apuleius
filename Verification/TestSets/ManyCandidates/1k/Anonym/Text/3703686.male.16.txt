hub or a business hub. I find it terribly disturbing that there are companies out there who capitalize on this new found market, with parents and schools being "kiasu" (a local term for "afraid to lose") and have all sorts of short camps and courses to "teach" the students how to do business. So they get a few people in and give a few talks on marketing and what not to little kids as young as 10 years old and give them a stall to run at a carnival and that is the "experience" and "learning process". No doubt it is an experience, BUT then again, when you have the same thing in tertiary institutes, when you are 18 to 20 years old, it leaves much to be desired isn't it? It doesn't help that with all the hype and chest-thumping, confidence boosting, creativity awakening, you make youths fired up and have fire instead of butterflies in their bellies and when they decide that they want to start a business, you tell them, look you are too young. Ask them why and what option have you, they tell you the exact same thing that you already know, "you need to be 21 years of age to register a business legally" and "any document signed by anyone under 21 years of age would not be legally binding" (I personally attest to that. I sent in a lengthy email to ACRA, the government body in charge of business registration). And so, they told me, the only option I have is to get someone above 21 years of age to register the business.       Does it makes sense to you? REGISTER YOUR BUSINESS UNDER THE NAME OF SOMEONE ABOVE 21 YEARS OF AGE. Well, I understand the legal portion of documents signed not being legally binding (see what I mean by constitution and law not ready for such a move?) But as for registering your business under someone else's name... First, it makes no sense to make someone else responsible for what you are doing. Second, Who would be so stupid whereby when you register under his name, you get the credit and he takes the shit.       And so, if I can't register a business, I can't run a business legally, since it's not a registered business, I can't pay taxes when I want to, so, if the authorities find out about me evading taxes, are they going to FINE my ass off and throw me into jail to make me out as an example to all other tax-evaders or would-be tax-evaders?       Well, maybe, just maybe, it is a secret plan by the government to try and make Singapore's night market as attractive as that of Taiwan's. With the youths picking up valuable bazaar experience and knowledge, Taiwan will have a competitor in the next 5 years or so, just you wait. ;oP       What I suggest is, if possible, create an environment whereby young entrepreneurs can start and run their businesses legally. As to how, we shall leave that to the incoming Minister for E
