that you felt so much more i know
sigh so ive been updating my xanga like crazy. so if you want to catch up on me, check there. basically ive managed to already get the whole band pissing down my neck. very pleasant, i assure you. gosh. well i dotn know what to say, ive got alot of everything on my xanga. ive got some pics from camp and like a hundred entries from today and yesterday or soemthing. so go check there for now. the username for that is savoreverymomentofthis. have fun kids.
its killing me. murdering me inside! i cannot, will not believe camp is over. all performances were beautifully and smoothly done. and now its over and i want to cry. i cried the other night when my mom drove me home because we were talking about highschool and i how i hate it so much and dont want to go. she was all "becky i know youre 15 and its hard to fit in" oh man that got me going. i was all "MOM IF I WANTED TO FREAKING FIT IT ID SMOKE SOME FREAKING POT LIKE EVERY OTHER SENSELESS LOSER THAT GOES TO FREAKING MCGUINNESS" ugh. pissed me off. so yeah i cried myself to sleep that night. my mom says that its hard right now for me in highschool because ive gotten a taste of what is waiting for me outside of the box. she says once i get to college i will meet more people like the drama kids from camp. man, the boys at camp were crazy. like tray would always say "have all the ladies gotten food yet?" before hed ever eat. and they ALWAYS held open the doors for you and never let you carry heavy things and never ever made you ride in the back seat. haha tray always made jole sit in the back. he said "pretty ladies get the front seat" :::::::smiles:::::::: oh how i will miss camp so sincerely. i didnt know kids like them existed. i pray to GOD that tray and jole and sean and lorryn get this youth thing set up quickly because its only been my first day off from camp and inside im already dying. camp made me so happy. like a happy i havent been in such a long time. everyone there is so secure and loves everybody and watches out for each other and dont care if theyre going to 'look stupid' or if theyre going to 'risk being cool' by singing or dancing or acting or any of that. its so great. so amazing. so DIFFERENT than everything im used to. its crazy. its like ive had a taste of happiness and of course it was only two weeks. i so wish it had been all summer. all year even. gosh it was so fun, so amazing. tyler, the director, is moving to new york in january, im gonna miss that guy. sigh. well. im going to part before i make myself cry again over lack of camptation. fare thee w
