...uhh a couple...no a lot of days. so here we go! starting from where i last left off.  i guess...uhh monday night i think it was. emily's soccer game got cancelled so she had nothing to do. so i employed the help of my chaffeur/parent to drive me to her house. and erblina was there waiting with emily in the drive way. and on the drive there i was shaking and i was really nervous because i hadn't seen emily in over a month so i was obviously extremely excited. and when i came into the driveway i was yelling out insanely in my mind but i couldn't really show it as i had wished to because erblina was there and so was my step dad. so i kept it to myself...if you ask me though i was really dissappointed to not have properly given her my "welcome back".  so we had a good time. we went to the house that her brother was house sitting at and we went on the trampoline...played "HOR". went back to emily's place watched the parent trap and tried to learn their neat handshake.  Then...on thursday, i went to the beach with emily erblina and kyle. and we got there at like 9:30 sat on the beach tanning and swimming, throwing a football around. then at about 1:30 i think tim got joined us and he seemed to be in a bit of a pissy mood considering he railed emily on the back with a sandal...and later hit her in the head which i didn't think was very appropriate. then when i tried to get up when we were on some rocks somewhere else i stumbled and hit my heel on a rock and it split the skin open and left a horrible cut which is still bothering me today. so yeah that was a pretty awesome day.  then on friday i went over to evan's house and we did the usual...watched movies..played video games. stayed up until 6:00 am. Then the next morning at 8:00 am my mom picked me up and we drove to southampton to one of her friends cottages. and there we...drank many alcoholic libations. but it was fine...i didn't get roaring drunk. then at sunset i went to the beach and watched the sun go down...and later that night when we went out for dinner...my mom sort of noticed that i was really sad...mainly because i was lonely and she could tell that so she's asking me about emily...and i just laughed because now everyone knows except for my dad. it's not that i don't want anyone to know it's just that i don't wanna go around telling everyone. so yeah...one successful weekend.  and now i'm here...to today. emily's online waiting for me to start talking again...and i'm downloading a music program called sibelius...illegally! wahhoo go pirating! and i'm gonna get some speakers from future shop...so that should be quite interesting...and nothing planned for tonight...hey! i'm free! Sam (8)now that we're together i've never been so lonely in my l
