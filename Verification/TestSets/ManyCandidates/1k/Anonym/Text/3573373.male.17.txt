then it was back to being awesome. and no, for the record, it had nothing even slightly pornographic in it. just that today, i awoke initially being sad that it was all a dream, dont you just hate that? but then i was like, "goddamn it nick, youve got to take action here unless youre going to be all sad and shit even longer if you let this go by." so, nick is mobilized and strategizing, trying to play his cardz.. and hopefully end up happy.  wish me luck.  roger that, -nick
aye carumba. my family (me, my dad, and my mom) is dysfunctional. thats for damn sure.  no need to stress the details here, but use your imagination of the most bitter and draining family setups youve seen on tv dramas (that usually end in a crime) and yeah, superimpose it on me. fun stuff.  ..........  cant really go back to moms house for a while, even dad is pissed. everything in life is pointless and unnecessary. as for this, i dont know. if i had any alternatives to turn to in these times, theres no doubt in my mind that i would take them.  to give all of this life up, and actually do something. in the meantime, time to start lining up houses to stay at, just in case.  ..........  i dont know. am i really this down and out? am i really this desperate? once again, i dont know.  i dont know anything anymore.  which leads me to believe, i probably never did.  ..........  so, heres to living life one day at a time. not knowing where or when life is finally going to catch up with you.  over and out, -nick
first of all, its time for:  the good-  2 weeks in hawaii = fun, fun. glad to be back though.  the bad-  house broken into, computer/other stuff stolen, room pillaged mad beastie boys style (along with the rest of the house).  the good-  robbers didnt take my money stash/other things that would have sucked if they had taken.  the bad-  suspicions placed on my friends/my possible DRUG habbits (wtf?!?!) by parents and police.  the good-  evidence points to street trash, not me or anybody i know (except that shady machanic).  ------------------------------------  the other-  having your house tossed really sucks! in addition to taking all sorts of stuff, knowing that some punkass bitch was all up in my room is kind of disconcerting. will they come back? probably not, but if they do, im sleeping with the kitchen knives for the next couple of weeks just in case. the important thing though is that it is all just stuff. the computer theft is lame, but its not like it cant be replaced. property is property and nothing more, i suppose its finally time for me to actually live up to that statement. so, time to count my money and go shopping (hopefully with some nice insurance money!).  "im a sniper with a hell of a scope, taking out a BURGLAR or two- they cant cope with me."  -
