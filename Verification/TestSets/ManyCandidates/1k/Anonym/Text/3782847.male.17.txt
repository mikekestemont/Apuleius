very much and will see her later.
HA! I have access now too!!  Now I can post things on this same page! Isn't that just cool. Anyways. I love you sweety. MUAH!
I love my girlfriend very much and she loves me back the same. We have been together since 6-5-03. We plan on moving to PA together and living happily ever after. I know i can't wait and she feels the same way. More to come in later posts.
So I have been waiting for you to come home since like 5pm. I hope youre home soon. I asked dad about the movie he said we can go. The movie is at 5:15 so he will have us at the theatre for 5. He also said I can go back to your house after the movie until 9:30. Not the greatest but its better than nothing. So I really hope you come back soon. I did call your house, but of course you weren't home. I wouldn't mind if you still called me when you got home, but I suppose it doesnt matter. dad isn't too excited about letting me go to the movies, but he will live. So we did have a cookout today. And never once was I told I could invite you. So I don't know what is going on with these people. So Rissa came and brought 6 of her friends. Fun for me huh. Yeah. Right. It wasn't too bad, I actually didn't feel too much like an outsider because I was invited to like play games with them and what not. It was kind of fun. I still would have had a better time if you had been there. I wish I wasn't working Saturday. I would like to have you over here for the day or something. There is this game Cranium that I have grown to love, and I want us to play sometime, that is with another 2 people also. So therefore probably my dad and Dale. Although they would probably be gay and not play because it would be playing with us. And they bitch if we aren't social with them but they don't have to be social with us. But whatever. I want to play it with you sometime while you are here. It is a really fun game. Anyways, I'll stop now. This has gotten pretty long. So I love you oodles of oodles. And you better get home soon! MUAH! I love you sweety.
Hey sweety. I miss you so much right now. I hope youre having a good time fishing. I'm not having such a good time with you fishing. I really hope you canc ome see me tomorrow. I figure I should also get your dad's cell phone number, then I can call that on Saturday and be guarenteed to get someone, or at least I would hope. Well I hope you get home soon, very soon. It's just about "before dark". So I love you oodles of oodles of oodles! MUAH! Come home soon! I love you s
