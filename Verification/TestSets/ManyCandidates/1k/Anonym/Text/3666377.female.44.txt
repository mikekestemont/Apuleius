the windows have screens on them and Gary claims there are no bugs in Germany.  There is also no AC so we keep the windows open and so we shall see about the bugs!  Gary then takes us on a walking tour of his city.  We head down to the Moselle River and walk along it to where it intersects the Rhine River at a place called German Corner.  There is a huge statue here and lots of flags and tourists around.  We stop in the Biergarten by the river and have a few beers sitting outside in the sunny breezy day.  So nice!  We continue with the walking tour then head back to Gary's.  A short while later we head out to meet Gary's girlfriend Monica for dinner.  She seems really nice.  Monica is German but works for the US Embassy and her English is outstanding.  We dine outside at an Italian Restaraunt on yet another river.  Across the river are acres of vineyards planted on steep hills ... wine country.  We return to Gary's apartment and settle in for the night.  We share a couple more beers out on the balcony as we drink in the atmosphere.  Church bells chime every 15 minutes and at 9:45 every evening they go crazy for 10 minutes .... ringing with no plan nor pattern.  Bells gone Wild!  Bells gone Crazy!!  Then the 10:00 chimes and no more bells that night.  By that time, Tom and I had been awake for over 24 hours and I was exhausted.  So, even though it was still light out, I slept ....
Tom and I were up early today ... bags packed and ready to go!  We had a car come pick us up and take us to the airport ... that went smoothly.  Check in also went well and then we got to hang out in the Admiral's Club, which was right across from our gate, until our flight.  Very Posh.  We had Bloody Marys and I used the internet to contact my SBD Fools.  Very relaxing!  The flight left on time at 2:30pm Texas time.  WOW!  Business Class is the way to travel!  I have so much leg room ... I can stretch my legs all the way out and still not touch the back of the seat in front of me.  The seats are multi-postional and come with their own TV's!!  The Stewardess started us off with Mimosas!  Yum!  There is a little kit for everyone in Business Class with ear plugs, an eye mask, hand lotion, toothpaste and brush, breath mints, and socks!  The menu choices were great ... but sadly, I can't remember what I had to eat!    We were due into Frankfurt at 7:30 Sunday morning.  It was a 10 hour flight ... but with the time change we basically flew through the night.  Lots of people slept ... but Tom and I read and watched movies and listened to music.  We drank lots of water and a few beers.  It was really the most comfortable flight I have ever h
