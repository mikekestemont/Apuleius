told her about Melody joining me in our search for TOBI. She was so happy to hear that, but also sad about Marcus and her. She, like me, was hoping that all of this chaos might bring the two of them closer rather than farther apart...but even Virginia reminded me that absence makes the heart grow fonder. I hope so for both of them. I know I certainly miss my Virginia, but hopefully once all this mess dies down, she'll fly up for the weekend and we can catch up on some stargazing. &nbsp; Oh, and someone asked me the other day about the titles for my posts here...I would think it would be obvious, but I do admire Shakespeare, he always put things so eloquently. So, I found this interesting site that has some of his quotes and when I put in the general feeling or idea that I have as a keyword, out pops quotes dealing with that word. Let's see if anyone can guess what was on my mind for this one ...
I know it's been a while since I've spoken. I must say that I'm still a bit in shock regarding the recent events in Amboy. Yes, I'm still here, and yes, I plan to stay for a while, but I'm just not sure what to think.  &nbsp; Why would Junior feel the need to do what he did? What can bring a person to&nbsp;a place such as that? We have good people dying needlessly every day and to have someone take their own life, it just seems so...wrong. I think we need more committment in life, more relationships, more love. For my part, I've tried to be supportive of everyone's views. I know Marcus is under a lot of stress, but since he seems to be isolating himself, I'll do my best from a distance. Melody is in a whole different ballgame. She is hurt and confused and somewhat vulnerable. Everytime I've seen her this week I've wanted to throw my arms around her and tell her that everything will be ok and that she should hang in there. She is such a nice girl and I hate to see her still so upset. At a time when she could really use Marcus' support, he's pulling away from her...hopefully he'll come to his senses. I can only hope that time will heal that wound...
TobI-IboT  "Behold, He comes with the clouds, and every eye will see Him, and those who pierced Him will see Him, and all the kindreds of the earth will wail because of Him. Even so, Amen. I am the Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the Ending, says the Lord, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty." (Rev 1:7-8)  We need to talk about God TobI  You talked to us about God once. You know where it is. We speak later today. If you want to know when? Follow God's word. For through me your days will be many, and years will be added to your life.  A
