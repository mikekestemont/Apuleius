and frankly, you aren't really in the mood....maybe you had a long strenuous day and the thought of getting sexually active with someone you have never met isn't really a turn on at that point. Or perhaps on Tuesday afternoon you received a call from a friend who really wants to see the new Wil Smith movie... There could be a thousand reasons why on Tuesday you just don't want to be with someone. I don't consider this standing someone up or blowing them off. I always make a point to tell the chattee that it's best if we meet up online first. I tell them if I am online then I will definitely be looking, but they may tell me they won't have access to a PC at that time. They may ask me to call or I may have given them my number, and if they call...or rather if my phone rings, I may ignore it and not pick up. I know this behavior is wrong, and childish, but that's basically what happens sometimes. What sounded good one day isn't as appealing the next or the day after and then oddly enough a couple days later it can do a complete turnaround and become appealing again. So herein lies my problem. And make no mistake it is  my  problem.  Effective immediately I am instituting a new policy on dating and hookups. Each category will have it's own rules and procedures which I expect to be followed closely within the following guidelines. I should point out now that said procedures, which are being posted below, are subject to change at the discretion of the Management.   Hook Ups  Effective immediately any trolling for hookups will be conducted only on the weekend and when an appropriate window of time is available. It is no longer acceptable to "plan" on meeting a potential hookup at a later date since I cannot be depended upon to keep an appointment.  Hookups in general, should be reduced to a minimum.   Dating  Effective immediately, any potential dates must engage in online or phone chat at a minimum of five separate occasions before I agree to meet them in person. This procedure alone will be certain to weed out those who are insincere in establishing a relationship while at the same time allow each of us to get to know each other; making our first meeting that much more enjoyable.  ====================  So perhaps I am at fault in the recent incidents of being stood up. Perhaps karma is getting me back for my previous reprehensible behavior, or perhaps the two gentlemen were anything but...I can't say for sure. I can't answer for their bad behavior but I can answer for my own. I am cleaning up my act on a physical level, it's time for me to do the same on a mental level.  The road ahead may very well turn out to be a lonely stretch of highway filled with potholes and bad signage but if I can get there unscathed I know I will be o
