around to the point where it is really not that funny anymore.  Im not trying to sound like the MOM of this blog for the record.
Hey guys, I just joined this, cuz you know that I am slow and stuff.  But anyways, I just want to say that this is a good idea to keep in touch, but I do not like the fact that someone is posting anonymously, and saying mean stuff, well unless it is a joke, and I am just out of the loop.
