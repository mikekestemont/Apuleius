a darling?  urlLink Kitten  just finished her 'lellow' hat, and she was showing it off.  I don't have kids, and sometimes my clock is ticking hard. That little girl both helps, and hurts; I know  urlLink Kitten  and  urlLink The Wanker's  lives have changed a lot since the kids were born, and they can be a bit loud, but...   Sigh. Anyway.  I'm working on a lace scarf, and it's actually working. Who knew? I got the pattern from  urlLink Rob's  sometimes-weekly newsletter... lets see if I can find it. Ah HA!  urlLink "Shells on the beach" . Bad picture. Simple pattern.  I like it. I'm doing a scarf in the random non-wool (it's cotton + something, I think) yarn that I swatched it in, and then maybe pick a variegated to try it again. Maybe double the pattern width. I can never leave good enough alone. I'm always tinkering....  Also, in the pattern it says just to knit the YOs normally... but i found that made the 'hole' almost disappear. So I'm knitting through the back loop of the YO, and the hole is nice and noticeable. Anybody else every have this problem? Is it a function of the weird way I knit? Hmmm.
Well, I promised you pictures... I LIED! BWHAHHAH!  Ok, I had some camera snafu's this weekend (we went to LB to visit Kitten and the Wanker) and didn't take pictures of anything. But I did the next best thing.  Here's Little Dead Bear, made for Red. I'll get a picture of them together at some point.    And I finally finished the red hat! Bit of a hodge podge; wool hat, acrylic stem, bright flaming green leaf. But its done!    A confession; I did something I never thought I'd do. I thought it was below me, or something. Messy, painful... could lead to things. Dangerous... But look at the colors!    That's Fiesta Jewel Print Mult ... by Red Heart.  Kill me. I bought a skein of Bleeding Aorta, and I love it. Knitting it with metal needles (so they don't squeak) and just kind of dashing off a pattern. I'm shocked at how much I don't mind the acrylic. Usually acrylic has me chewing my fingers off, but this isn't so bad.  And it was $2.50 for a 170 g skein. I'm going to make some hats for my friends who are wool allergic...  No nibbles on my offers to do web graphics. Not marketing myself enough, I don't think. And I probably should spend more than five minutes on ads for my services...
Finaly, a FO photoshoot!     That's Red and Little Dead Bear, who she calls Deady Fredy. [ETA: It's Deady Teddy, as some Yetti has corrected me. ]  Red is wearing my version of the  urlLink RockStar Scarf  I made her for Christmas... two years ago? Something like that. I used lime green mohair and Lion brand fun fur becuase it was what I had. She seems to like it, and says it's very warm.  See? the painting I did of Little Dead Bear looks just like h
