the pavement, she kept picking up different feet (the pavement must've been hot) we decided to go home. Well, I decided. She panted in the back of the car the whole hour trip home. She's passed out on the couch right now.  After that, took a shower, did some laundry, and all that crap. Went over to Mike's. On the excellent advice of a friend, did my best to alter my attitude towards my foibles. Had limited success, but I'm still new at it, so I'm trying to be tolerant of myself. Had a long talk about my fears, and his perspective, and agreed to take things as they come. I think he's just humoring me, and is convinced that everything will be fine, but I know from personal experience that just being in love isn't enough. So, I guess we're humoring each other. Oh well. If I pretend long enough, maybe it'll sink in.  Came home, did more laundry, and am now getting ready for bed. Forgot to get a new guy shirt, and left the old one there, so I'm "alone" tonight. Ugh. I guess I'll break out the satin jammies and the teddy bear - next best thing. But I do finally have a fan for my bedroom. Yay!!!!  Short week next week - leaving for the Dells Friday AM. I can't wait......
Last night was difficult. Pretty much because I made it so.  So I was making dinner before we went to see The Village. Tortellini, my recent fave. Heated up the sauce, the pasta was almost done -- and then I managed to knock the full dish of hot sauce off the counter. It was one of those slow-motion Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooo moments, you know? It sucked. Splashed hot spaghetti sauce  everywhere . On me. On my new shirt. All across the kitchen, including the walls. And  ceiling . My computer, which lives on the breakfast bar.  I'm afraid I lost it. It's been a while since I lost my temper like that. A looooooong while. After screaming and hitting a few walls, I started cleaning up. Mike was taken aback, I think. No, I know. I'm on my hands and knees on the floor, crying and shaking with absolute rage. Not anger,  rage.  It scared me. So, once the worst of it was cleaned up, I threw my clothes in the washer and got in the shower. I had sauce in my hair, even. It was bad.  Once in the shower, all that rage turned inward, as usual. Standing there in the shower, sobbing, hating myself, I realized that I'm probably not ready for this whole serious relationship thing. I mean, I'm still damaged goods, you know? Mike kept saying "I'm not scared off", to which I replied "Then you aren't as smart as I think you are."  And I keep finding splatters of sauce this morning. I'm hoping it will be funny soon. Really hoping hard.  Oh, and the Village sucked ass. I fell asleep during it. Not recommended. Unless you're drunk. Then it might be o
