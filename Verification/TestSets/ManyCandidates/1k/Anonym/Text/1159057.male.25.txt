wants this -- to try and have the last word. Well, the move is the end of the conversation. And what I'm spending tonight completing is the start of shutting my mouth. I tried to clean earlier tonight, and I gutted my office of old furniture and crap I didn't want to move later in the year. But my effort was incomplete. The effort I made didn't match my new life, or my true emotional state. I was hanging onto things out of habit. It all has to go. I will sleep in my own house tonight. Mine.  So I actively sought them out tonight. In drawers. In piles of mail. Dressers. None of them mean anything. I was a victim in this whole thing. The days of feeling responsible for two people's baggage are over. None of the other things are even worth my effort to put on eBay. They go out to the trash as well as soon as I post this. I'm thinking about hurling out a lot of family baggage, too. I hang onto too much. None of if reflects me anymore anyhow.  And as stupid as it sounds, I need S to know that I'm earnest about my feelings. I like her company on this adventure far too much to risk it.   And I'll tell you, after you find the first thing hiding out somewhere and toss it away you feel like a million fucking bucks. And the sleep of the righteous and freed is your reward. I learned this tonight, this late in the game. It's amazing how many things in life you assume will hurt, and feel like flying when you actually do them.
Wow. WiFi in the middle of downtown Greensboro. How cool is that? As long as I pick a spot within the shadow of a building I'm not too hot, and the reception seems as if it's pretty good all over the block. I wonder if it leaks into the Cultural Center enough to make it usable while I have some crab dip and a beer @ Europa? I just have to remind myself that for the one measly hotspot we have in Greensboro, there are probably eight million in DC.   Speaking of the whole DC plan, S and I have been having the time of our lives lately. After making it through ther turmoil of the last couple of weeks, and my best attempts to subconciously fuck it all up, we are both being graciously rewarded. I can't even begin to tell you how excited I am to be taking these first few steps with someone like her. I feel as though I found a vein of serenity running through all the fast-paced goings on lately. Yes, Virginia, there is a girl who's smart, hot and hilarious. And she happens to like spending time with me.  Alright, it's getting warm out here and the car fumes are starting to make me feel woozy. But it was fun while it lasted. Off to spend an hour or two with my brother.
