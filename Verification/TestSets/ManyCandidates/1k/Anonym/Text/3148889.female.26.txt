few days.....let the girl know. Don't go about your life for a week without calling and expect for the girl to be happy to hear your voice. A couple of minutes out of 24 hours is not too much to ask, but men don't see that way. Ugh, I think I'm having a moment..... The guys have gone on to start another company called  urlLink Recognition Group .  Tom has a small page on his family's company  urlLink website  about the whole govWorks, Startup.com and other things people might be interested to know about.    Btw, Tit for tat's filming was postponed until July 31....this is the final postponement because I can't take it anymore....    I've got movies to make and by golly, they're going to get made!(doesn't that sound like a good slogan? I might have to use that....)
I was totally grooving on some old school Keith Sweat.  Anyone remember the now classic    urlLink Make It Last Forever  album from the late 1980s?  Get educated on some of the grooviest R & B music and my closest friends know this is my least favorite musical genre, so this must be some good sh*t!
Why do I always expect for my soulmate to be some lonely spaz until my vibrant spirit inhabits his world?  That's so silly for me to think because I would never want to be with someone like that.  I love people with personality, like moi.  Someone crazy and a bit off their rocker, because they would have to be in order to want to be with me.
urlLink Dodge Magnum  is my new dream ride of the week.  Last week, I was all about the  urlLink Chrysler 300 .
My favorite show on television is American Chopper on Discovery.  Take a gander at the  urlLink OCC  website....hot sh*t!
I'm so excited that the new  urlLink Canon XL2 's are coming out, so I can get a better deal on a Canon XL1.  Yeah, it's pretty much all about moi....lol!
SONG OF THE DAY:  Alone in Kyoto by Air  I got a marriage proposal from some Indian dude via email, so he could move to the United States....lol!    He says he'll take care of me for the rest of my life and never cheat on me.  Hmmm.  Nah!
A cool female filmmaker.....Meet  urlLink Dina Mande .  The  Tit For Tat  shoot went well on Saturday.  I was running late as usual and it was a 30 drive to the set.  On top of everything, I was running on about 2 hours of sleep.  I felt good about all of the performances, I just wish I had more time for extra shots(closeups and such).  We didn't start filming until nearly 2pm and I had to be back in OKC at 4pm.  The film will be between 5 and 10 minutes in length.  The cast was fantastic and everyone got along so well.  I had a wonderful director of photography and lighting guy.  The total cost of production was around $60, which is basically little to no budget.  We'll be doing the editing next week in T
