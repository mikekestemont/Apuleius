I'm a beauty-product-aholic.  But each time I use it, I wonder.  Don't bad things like radiation and illness make hair stop growing?  Hmmm... there's a pretty thought.  Ah well, we all have our stubborn vices.  You know, those smokers that say all tough:  "well, ya gotta die from somethin'!  you could get run over in the street tomorrow!"  Yep, that's me, with my leg defuzzing lotion... throwing caution to the wind!  Hey, ya gotta die from somethin'!  Why not from creepy lotion?  I'm such a badass.  Hey, that wasn't meant to be funny.  Grr.
Well, it's campaign time, when we should take inventory of the things most important to us and determine which candidate lines up closest to those issues.  I was all set to vote for Kerry, until he kept us waiting in the hot July Carolina sun for 5+ hours.  Oh, he's still the top choice, being able to pronounce "nuclear" and all, but I think there's one thing that could turn the tide.  My vote will go to the candidate that brings back Government Cheese.  That's right, that pale orange rectangular block of dairy goodness.  Somehow much more flavorful than anything sold by Kraft, and reassuring in its solidness.  No pre-slicing here, boys and girls... you could slice it up yourself to whatever size you chose.  Now, is that Democracy or what?  The freedom to slice!  Oo, I'm getting goosebumps!  If you've never tasted Government Cheese, you may think I'm overstating its grandeur.  But I assure you, I am not!  Blessed with an aunt who received the stuff on a regular basis and was generous enough to share it with my mom, I am one of those who still longs for that mellow, slightly cheddary taste.  This was REAL cheese, not the "cheese food" that is sold package by crinkly package in the dairy aisle.  It complimented macaroni to perfection, and offset bologna with a subtle tang that simply made one beam with delight.  And "I'm not the only one" dreaming of those sweet days of Government Cheese; anyone who knows will agree.  I mentioned it to my roommate once, as we were sitting on the couch drinking beer, and he nearly fell off the couch in a moment of recognition (well, and laughter too... he'd had a few more than I).  We found a new point to bond over as we reminisced about Government Cheese.  Perhaps we should start a grassroots movement:  Americans for the Reinstatement of Government Cheese!  ARGC!  All sympathizers, let's plan a rally to announce our support for whomever can rise above the muck of policy and bring back the cheese!
While walking my dog tonight, I noticed that one of my neighbors (just 'round the corner in my 'plex!) has a Kerry Edwards sign in the window.  This made me break into a bright grin & squeal a quiet "heck yeah!"  That makes two, including mine, that I know of, but I am an optimist.  My upstairs neighbor's Bush sign hasn't been up for a couple of weeks.  Hmm... maybe he needs a new s
