can still watch either on T.V. or via  urlLink the live hill-cam from parliament hill .
First  urlLink Nicholas Berg , and now  urlLink Paul Johnson . 2 men who were just doing their jobs. My heart goes out to the families of the 2 American civillians who were taken hostage and beheaded by heartless Al-Qaeda bastards. What kind of mindset could you possibly have to think that you are justified to cut off someone's head? These poor, sad, pathetic, loathsome, worthless, oxygen wasting fuckers really bother me. I think we should find the disgusting pukes who did this and go old testament on them, and do an eye for an eye, and cut off their worthless heads. I know that might take us down to their level but it's the only thing I can think of that is a fitting enough punishment.
I've recently started a new Blog dedicated to my poetry and writtings. You can find it at  urlLink http://hakxpoetry.blogspot.com  if anyone cares to take a look at it. Your comments are welcome as always.
Remember growing up and watching cartoons on saturday mornings? Now we have The Cartoon Network 24 hours a day.  Remember playing good guys and bad guys outside with your friends? Now we have bloody first person shooter video games.  Remember taking a trip to the beach and slpashing in the waves? Now we have indoor wave pools in the city.  Remember when you wanted to see a new movie you had to go to the theater? Now we can download the movie off the internet, sometimes before the movie even gets to the theater. Remeber when you could go to the movies for $5.00? Now it costs over $25.00 for two people, not including popcorn and drinks. Remember when gas cost under 50 cents? Now we're lucky if it's under $1.

urlLink    Two of the most famous T.V. cars ever! The General Lee and Kit from Knight Rider. On one hand you had 2 back woods red neck brothers driving a souped up charger running from the law screaming YEHAA!! as they drove "as the crow flies". And on the other hand you had a nomad lady killer driving a talking car with turbo boost and an ejection seat. If I was given the choice of either car it would be a very tough decision.
