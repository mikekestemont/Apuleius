you."    That's 87% accurate... gosh damn it.
Ok, there's not much to post in here, but i want to keep this thing occupied i'll post what i wrote in xanga    "Bowling for last place" Yesturday was a semi alright night, pretty boring though, but it was alright cause i went out.  Jorge, Bilma, me and Yvette had setup to go bowling at 8. Earlier Mayra had called me to say what's up so i invted her along with ashley and 3 other of her chick friends. So when i get to the place, no one was there, but then Mayra and her gang comes (Mayra, Ashley Brenda -myra's sister, and 2 other unknonw characters) And then a few minutes later Yvette arrives, so we're there waiting for stupid jorge, but we got tired and decided to play one game since we all were broke bitches, well except me, but i didnt' want to dish out $30 for the rest to play, so we only played one game. I totally sucked as usual, but it was cause they didnt start the good music and turned off the lights til 11, so it sucked that way, and therefor i didn t get inspired to play well haha.  And yvette here was playing pretty good compared to the rest of us, and being her first time. And it was aroud 9:40 when we finsihed, and guess who calls? the black dumb mother head saying that he was almost there, good job.  But we couldn't stay any longer cause dam mayra had to be home by 10.  So i call my parents to pick us up, and so we're outside waiting, and then here comes jorge all fucking pimp with his awesome looking dodge lol.. i was like whoa whoa no fair! So parents come, and we leave jorge and yvette playing, i guess for another half an hour? i dunno, morons they get to play when its going to be the good hour. So i don't know how i did it, but i got all 5 of these ppls in my truck, and we took off. I think my dad was high, cause he was being like super nice, he was offering dinner and alot of other things to these people, i was like whoa, cause like he didnt want to lent me money, so i had to use my own, and then he's here offering.. moron lol oh well, that's cool. And we arrived at Mayra's place and droped the whole package. And then jorge calls to see if i can coem back, but obviously knowing my parents, they won't let me. So i jsut went straight home :( oh well.. but it was an alright night i guess.. could have been better though.. but its okay, it was fun. Anyhow, today i don't know what are we going to be upto, most likey lunch with family and that's it i guess. Well if anyting interesting happens, i'll update again, just incase you feel like getting bored. Well my lovers, i'll c-ya around, l
