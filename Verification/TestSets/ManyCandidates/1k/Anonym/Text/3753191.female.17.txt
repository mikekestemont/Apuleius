the new girl was hired.  Speaking of which, I think copy editing is what I want to do (at least at an entry level position) when I start hunting for my first job after college. You know, for the last four or five years I've been set on majoring in journalism, but after doing a bit of research I started having doubts. I'm spending a lot of money and putting a lot of effort toward going to college and getting my bachelor's degree, only to go into a disgracefully low-paid field in which I'll receive just enough to get by in a small apartment and my barely-paid-for Toyota Echo.  Journalists do a thankless (and horribly underpaid) job. Not only is it thankless, but those in the field are often accused of being biased, slanting the news, showing favoritism towards one political party or the other, etc. Talk about shooting the messenger. And the newspaper business is dying. The general population is relying on TV and the internet for instantaneous news. Newspapers are having to lay off their employees in some cases.  Double sigh .  Aaaaanyway, I think the only thing I have left to say for now is a note to  Mira . Thanks for the comment you left on my last post (that is, if you were being sincere. I feel you were though). :) It was very nice -- unexpected, but nice nonetheless.
What a week.  Broke up with Matt and lost a friend in a matter of days.  Maybe tomorrow I'll be hit by a bus or something.  Because there's so many buses in this town...yeah.  That would top it off nicely.   What is it about me?  I'm just different from other people.  Instead of having several acquaintances, I keep a few very close friends.  Now I realize why so many people choose to keep a bit of a distance from their 'friends.'  It's not such a hard loss if one slips through your fingers.  I'm not perfect by any means.  Anyone who knows me will tell you I'm temperamental, moody and easily agitated.  I don't choose my words carefully (or keep my mouth shut) when I probably should.  I realize I have been stricken with these traits and attempt to keep them in check as much as I can, but it usually doesn't work.  Why should I be so surprised when I offend or hurt someone close to me?   You know what, I need to stop taking advantage of people.  The friend I lost today always kept a cool head with me even when I wasn't the most pleasant person to chat with.  He dealt with my flaws better than most people could, and I screwed it up because I allowed myself to take advantage of his good nature.   So, you-know-who, I am sincerely sorry.  I don't expect things to ever be the same, nor do I expect you to talk to me again, but please know that I regret what I said.   By the way, I finally broke 100k in mids.  Still haven't beat you though.   F
