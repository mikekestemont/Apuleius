I can smile at her the next time she or a kind like her are trying to suck the life out of the room, and I now know that whatever happens, you can either&nbsp;complain about the stench or you can&nbsp;stay away from trash.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I'm babbling a bit, I know, and it is probably that these tooth soothers are also a bit of truth serum and maybe I feel strongly enough about what I learned to share it with you, because we all have had the misfortune to meet people like this.&nbsp; The moral of this story is:  &nbsp;  This kind, these moral prostitutes need not bother you.&nbsp; They self destruct on their own.&nbsp; Pay attention to more important matters.&nbsp; Bottom feeders like this will live the rest of&nbsp;their miserable lives eating their own&nbsp;shit in the murky depths, while if you stay as far away as possible,&nbsp;you will continue to swim to the top...Where life is going on.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  For Atom enabled feed, click here:    urlLink ATOM FEED
Writing.  That's what I've been doing if anyone asks.  Not going out all the time or hanging out by the TV watching soap operas, I have been really really focusing on the new book and editing my little butt off.    THIS IS NOT A LOVE SONG  This will most likely be the title.  Not Let It Bleed, as once planned.  I really like the new title.  People keep calling and inviting me out.  People I want to hang out with.  Things I want to do.  But I can't.  I'm in a zone.  I only stopped a minute ago to write this, because I want to update readers on what's going on in the process.  That is, after all, the real reason I keep this online diary.    I'm not interested in telling everyone and anyone who wants to know every detail about my personal life,(and obviously from what you've read in my blogger I don't).  Moreso, the blogger is here because when I like something someone writes or created in some form, I want to know a little about the artist's process, their experiences, maybe a little about them in the artistic sense.  I don't want to know their dirty laundry.  Just maybe more about how they create.  So that's what I'm trying to do here, right?!?  I am very very happy with what I'm working with here on the new book.  So excited about it.  One of my friends recently said the coolest thing about my writing.  He said he liked my work a lot, because it was like architecture.  That it was building up to create something larger.  Pretty good line, huh?  He is a songwriter and has some pretty damn good lines himself in his songs, so I am flattered.  Architecture is apparently his favorite pastime, the study of it, and so on.  So if my work reminds him of his favorite thing, that's a very very nice compliment.  I really do need to go.  I'm sorry.  I just have to finish this.
