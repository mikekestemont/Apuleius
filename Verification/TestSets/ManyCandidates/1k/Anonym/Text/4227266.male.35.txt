Earl the First:  Underaged kid, ejected for sneaking alcohol, was introduced to me as someone who would not be returning, promptly fell on his face. He spent the rest of the evening passed out in a pool of vomit face down in the parking lot. His friends left him there and went back in to see the show.

1 (one) 0.5 lb Salmon - tasty. 5 (five)  lamb tacos - Okay, but no cilantro. Neither myself nor my roommate have anything even remotely related to a green thumb.
