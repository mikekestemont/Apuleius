Canadian Idol bandwagon.  I think that the singers this year are so much better than the singers last year!  My fave person prolly would be Jason, he's so much fun.  I think Kalan will go all the way, because there are a lot of teeny bopper girls here in Canada, who will vote for him because hes cute. But he's also a good singer, so I dont mind if he does win. The judges seem to like Caleb a lot.. He's got soul. I don't see what's so good about him.. He's the only black dude in the competition, and I guess they do want that soul in it.. I dunno..
About a month and half ago, I bidded on an exersaucer on ebay, and won the auction.  Well, the seller was so immature. She told me she couldn't find my Postal Code, so I'd have to go and find my own shipping. I went on united states postal service, and found a good shipping quote.  She told me that they wouldnt' take it, so she'd make it smaller. I waited, and waited and waited, and she didn't email back. So.. two days ago, Ebay emails me, saying that this seller and I have mutally agreed to cancel the transaction. That's great, cause I don't want it anymore, but the seller didn't inform me that she was going to do this. We got an exersaucer from a garage sale on my street, but it's a boring one with hardly any toys on it.  We saw them in Zellers for 50 bucks cheaper than anywhere else we've been. What's wrong with them??
Ahh I really do need to move out of Bancroft, and my mothers house. Don't get me wrong, my mother helps me so much with Mason it's great. But, she does get on my nerves a lot too. There are some issues with her, my father and my ex-sister-inlaw.. And I hear her talking about it every single day. She doesn't let up and it's making me go crazy.   Come on military, give us a house NOW
I was at the grocery store, buying Mason some jar food. I got a little more than I really needed, but I just wanted to stock up on it.  Anyways, at check-out, the lady behind me gave me her opinion. "Ya know, it's cheaper to make that yourself" So I replied. And than she asked me how old Mason was and I told her. She gave me the meanest look and said.."Can he even sit up by himself"  So I told her that I follow my instincts, he's doing well with his sweet potatoes, he's digesting it great and all.  She just shook her head. I was so mad at her.  This lady was a very overweight lady, wearing something way to small for her. I could have said.. " You know, being very obese likeyourelf, it isn't good for your health" Or I could have said.."You're burning my retinas, with what you're wearing" Some ppl, they just don't know how to keep their mouths s
