humans as a whole decide to make an effort towards displaying more empathy toward other humans.  This would force us all to have an open mind in al facets of life, which would in turn make us all better people.  If the thug could understand the yuppie along with all other subcultures and vice versa we would the stereotypes that have been regurgitated from generation to generation.  I am not saying that we should all be best friends, but we should all try to understand each other to make the world a better place.
You know with the whole Democratic convention thing going on, I have notice my complete and total lack of interest, but why?  The reason is that the end is more exciting than the beginning. Both candidates are too serious and Americans are stressed out.  The fact that the news reports the same information over and over again does not help matters.  Speaking from personal experience, if I know what you are going to say I won’t pay as much attention the second time around.  I mean really, why would the gatekeepers want us to be informed any way (kidding)?   I think that if we were to go back to basics, like for instance archaic power struggles to decide a leader if there is another close tally would spark more interest in the hearts of Americans.   Don’t get me wrong I would have tuned in to the Democratic convention but the fact that a bunch of rich white males raising their arms and laughing as they try to boost their popularity points for future poles while I look for a second job to pay for my student loans just is not appealing to me.  I can appreciate what they are doing and why, but I feel that Kerry is making some promises that he may not be able to keep which will not help him in the long run.   What the candidates should try doing is making their campaigns entertaining; offer more humor, or something more palatable to the common man (which is the main demographic that will be reached by television).  If Kerry or Edwards did something off the wall not only would it give us something new to hear about, it would spark a new interest, and maybe get more people interested (for instance people watch “Fear Factor” because they wonder what the contestants will have to do next).  There may not be a debacle like last years election but if there were it would be cool to see the two duke it out in a ring or something (it would be pretty interesting to see how each would stack up in a ring don’t you think).  They could have catchy slogans like “pound for pound I am the best choice”, or “Bush’s face and America’s problems have something in common.  They will both get punched out.”   It does not have to be that extreme, but you get the drift.  However after fighting I do not think any one would be so ready to go to w
