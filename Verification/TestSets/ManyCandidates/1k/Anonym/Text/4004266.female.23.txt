living CLOSE to where you go to school, work or whatever you do during the day. That cuts down on commute time, traffic, pollution (hey - the less time you spend in the car, the less you pollute!). So that should take care of having air conditioning at work. The only case I see that it is necessary to have air conditioning is a room full of temperature-sensitive machines where you need to control the environment or something catastrophic occurs.    At Home  Well, maybe people should consider not living in the city so much. Cities usually have a microclimate where temperatures are a few degrees warmer than in the country. Trees also usually provide shade... that helps with the temperature problem too! Perhaps people should also think of leaving the lights off unless necessary (that would help with energy consumption as well), drink water, etc. Perhaps the reason people think they cannot live without air conditioning is because they are so used to it that they make it a big deal if they don't have it. Everyone before the advent of air conditioning managed to get through their life without it. Perhaps air conditioning should only be available to seniors or those who are susceptible to heat stroke.    Cars  Turn on your vents all the way up!     Of course, this would only work in an idealized world, and only because most won't listen to this. There's a lot of things in my idealized world that probably would supposedly not make any sense in the real world, but it can't hurt to think about it, can it?    Feel free to discuss :)
My tBlog account expired a couple of months ago, because I didn't post or log in often enough for their liking. But Blogger has let me sign up for a blog, so I'm now on Blogger. (The reason I signed up for tBlog was because Blogger wouldn't let me. I'm not sure why...)     &nbsp;   So I'm back at work, wondering what to do during lunch hours, or after hours, or before hours... even during hours. It's lunch time right now, and I didn't really feel like heading down to the cafeteria. So I've decided to restart my blog, with the hopes of actually keeping up with it.     &nbsp;   Hopefully there will be enough interesting things to talk about in my life in the next while. Otherwise, there won't be very many posts. I will apologize for that in advance.     &nbsp;   That said, I'm done for the day.
Friday was a very "accidental" day. I started off the day reinstalling my computer, which I started on Thursday... but trying to sync my code to the "master copy" didn't work. Therefore, I became really annoyed and deleted everything to start anew.      Unfortunately, I had forgotten that I had saved ALL of my work in that folder I just deleted. So I lost everything I did that week.      If it wasn't for the fact that it's a bit of a pain to redo, it's actually quite funny.      Nothing of note really happened on Friday. U
