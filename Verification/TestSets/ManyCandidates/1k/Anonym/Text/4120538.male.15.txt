the dancing cup. I'm so proud. BUT hey, I look on the bright side. Now I can say my first job was a Quiznos dancing cup. :)  Wow, I'm going camping tomorrow. I'll be back Saturday. Should be fun. Were are going to play poker some of the time. I will kick ass, and win!  Also today I went to Eaton to practice shooting hoops. And there were a group of other people playing, and they invited me to play. It was fun. lol.  Well I'm off to pack. Catch you later homies!
Period 1: Carroll, Church History   Period 2: Trotch, AP English   Period 3: Puga-Dempsey, Spanish 2   Period 4: Tsutsui, Algebra 2   Period 5: Bennett, US History   Period 6: Roemer, Honors Chemistry      Dude, I can't believe school is going to start soon. ah.
Well the day is ending and it's getting closer and closer to camping. I wonder if were going to make fire with sticks, that would be interesting. If I had to make the fire, I'd cheat and bring gas and matches, but I'd probably start a forest fire...and bears would die! We don't want that to happen.  Played basketball. I must say I've improved in the past day. Can't wait until I'm actually good enough to join the NBA. *coughs and dies of laughter*  I'm off to watch a mooooovie. "Minority Report."
Yo, my home skillut biscuits  /slash/  cookies  /slash/  oven products. Yeah, anyways. Today has been a lazy day. I didn't do that much besides sleep, eat, and movies. I love those kind of days when you don't have to worry aboot school work, and you can be a potato of a couch. Don't get that many days, so enjoy.  I think I'm going to go play basketball soon...  I need to go see "The Village." Looks unpeaceful. I'm going to be going camping in 2 days. I hope it doesn't suck like when you just realize there's no more toilet paper after you've done your drop of the bombs. Has that ever happened to you? *bad memory* What does one bring while going camping? hmm..  I'll write later. bupbye!!
I woke up at 8:00a.m. Yes, yes, I know - How could I? I was actually joyful because I thought I was going to get my braces of today. That's the reason why I woke up early..k, yeah. So I was late getting there. And to my surprise the dentist comes up and says, "Guess what?" I'm like, "What?" He's said "Your going to have your braces for another month." I mean he said with such excitement that I felt like slapping the bastard. So that ruined my day.       hmmm....what else did I do today? ah yess...      Went to the local LI of BRARY to renew my 5 freakin' books that I have to read for AP English. Why the hell I am in AP? *pounds head* Then played basketball..and rented lots of movies. THE END!           "  I hate braces!  "
