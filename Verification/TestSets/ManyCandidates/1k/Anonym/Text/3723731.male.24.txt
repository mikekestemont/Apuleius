odd cuz I sure do?!?! After buying our fireworks we went back to Jolee's and decided to shoot them off by her lake. This is the point where some of us (if not all of us at one point and time) almost lost our lives! First we start off with some sparklers that seem pretty harmless, but lemme tell ya they are not! When those things light they explode in heat and light and I think every single one of us burned the end of our thumbs. Then we decided to do bottle rockets. Well instead of putting them in the sand by the lake and letting them take off like they're supposed we all decide to light them and throw them (not smart I know!). So we're start lighting them and throwing them and everything is ok until Steve decides to hold one and let it take off from his hand! Well the thing takes off and the fuse backfires in his face shooting hot sparks into his eye and onto his shirt. Well needless to say he immediately grabbed his eye and groaned and someone (I can't remember now) ran over and took care of his shirt that was still burning and now has holes in it. Of course he tried to play it off all cool like he wasn't hurt, but I know that burning hot sparks in your eye would not feel good! So after we saw that he was semi-okay we continued playing with the bottle rockets. Since we were near a lake we decided it would be fun to throw the bottle rockets in after lighting them to see if they would explode under the water. So we started doing that and found out thta they did. This was kinda fun cuz it looked like someone was setting off bombs under the water and they when they exploded the made this cool sound and let off this green light. So we all decided that we would all light a bottle rocket (or two) and throw them into the water at the same time to simulate "war". Well we all lit them and tossed them in, but Amy didn't toss hers in right and the thing turned around in the water and came flying right back at us. The thing flew right between Steve and Aaron and exploded right behind them. Amy thought this was quite amusing, but I did not! I particularly don't like the idea of a bottle rocket exploding in my face. Needless to say this happened more than once so we told Amy she could no longer participate in the bottle rocket "war". Then Jolee and Aarron decided to light a box of sparklers at once and Aaron almost lost his head cuz those things exploded all at once! And there are more stories I could tell, but I think you get the point. After the night was said and done I thanked the Lord for saving my life numerous times and rested well knowing that I had escaped death. Ha h
