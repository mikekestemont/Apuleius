popular movie are Phoebe Cate's bare breasts and Sean Penn. 5. He's the Gutte.  I mean seriously.  It's like trying to compare Rex Morgan MD with Prince Valiant.  It's time that could be better spend reading today's Marmaduke (which is solid by the way).    urlLink    They couldn't even get a decent picture of Judge.&nbsp; urlLink
I Dare you to post a Better Picture than this!   I don't think it can be done.  I'd say more, but I think I've done enough today just by posting what could perhaps be "the greastest Guttenberg picture ever".    urlLink    A fitting in preparation for the big event?...&nbsp; urlLink      Now if you actually feel like reading something, pop open a Jello Pudding Snack and check out what  urlLink Peabs  has to say.
Maybe there isn't a God afterall.   Apparently the radio's finally started to play too much good music, and somebody's trying to do something about it.   urlLink Three of the four former members of Creed have put together a new band, because there's just not enough crap to fill the void created once Creed left apparently.   They are calling themselves Alter Bridge and the first show is in Pontiac Michigan.  Now normally I wouldn't ask anyone to go to this show, but there is a recurring nightmare I've had after hearing of this and I need to make sure it doesn't happen.  You know how in  Spinal Tap   the guitarist leaves the band, but then later is standing backstage wishing he was out there and the lead singer asks him to come out and play and they reunite to play Japan?  Well, in this nightmare, it's the same thing only with Scott Suck (or whatever his name is, you know, Creed's old singer)coming from backstage to reunite with the band, only in the dream they don't get sent off to Japan.  So if anyone can go to this show, make sure Scott Suck doesn't get on that stage.  Take whatever means possible.  And if you have some spare time during the show, try your best to break-up this new act while your at it.  I'll send you a toaster if you can get any of them deported to Japan.  People of Michigan, you are our only hope.
Relaxing and Rocking on Rooftops.   As Al can attest, I love the combination of rooftops and drinks.  I really don't think there's a better combo around.  So it's a good thing that in LA the rooftops are pretty cool.  This weekend I spent Sunday on top of the Standard Hotel in Downtown at the  urlLink Vice  party.  Thanks to Moss for scoring the tickets.   urlLink The Fever  played a short set.  It rocked and I'm pretty sure they did a GnR cover.  They're playing  urlLink Spaceland  soon.  Go see them.  Another highlight of the day was some Road Rules or Real World guy who's a bartender there now, yelling at Moss and  urlLink Kerry  "No Pictures!" as they tried to sneak a snapshot of him.  Oh yeah, and free Sparks.  That rocked too.   urlLink    The Fever: Rocking  the rooftop Downtown.&nbsp; u
