and I caught a number of photos and some movie footage on the trusty camera. We went out for Karaoke afterwards, and had a pretty good time running through J-Pop and Eminem tunes with a bunch of people.  Saturday was spent trying to get the apartment sorted out, and I went out to the best place in Yonezawa for sushi with some JETs and their Japanese friends. I feel somewhat guilty that I have been eating out pretty much every night (under the guidance of Andrew-sensei!). The food here is nice, although some of the stuff available in the 'foreign' food stores is a bit pooey. Peanut butter is a gelatinous mess. Most cereals are sugar encrusted cardiac depthcharges. Its just a matter of being persistent and eventually something palatable turns up.
Here are a couple of pictures from the Uesugi shrine, a moderately famous attraction in Yonezawa. Apparently the Uesugi clan brought great prosperity to the people of Yonezawa and are still highly revered by the locals. It was a bit late to go running around taking photos, but I didn't let common sense get in the way.  Note that even in the temple grounds, you can still score a refreshing beverage from one of the three(!) vending machines there.   urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink
Vending machines are cool. I chucked 200 yen (about $NZ3) into one and a cute little robo kitset fell out. The sword is a bit floppy, but its still a neat little toy.  Some of the electronics stores here have fantastically elaborate kitsets, with huge (and hugely expensive) assault suits available. The Gundam models seem to be the dominant types.   urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink
I have been looking through some of the Vodafone propaganda, trying to decide on a keitai (mobile phone).  Some of the features that caught my attention: - Video conferencing functionality - TV tuner - 2 Megapixel camera  Oh so saexay.  Unfortunately, I have to wait until the 16th of August before my Alien Registration Card is available (Vodafone requires this to set up a call plan).
Badminton indoors with no aircon @ 30+ degrees. Despite being loads of fun (especially when you play with two shuttles at one time), you are sure to end up totally drenched after an hour of play.  Recently, I biked to the onsens in Onogawa as Andrew lead the way (an onsen is a natural hot pool). For someone in better shape, the ride there and back wouldn't have been so bad, but at this stage even marginal inclines are a killer on my body. The onsen we went to was quite nice, although we cut it rather fine when it came time for the change over (when the male only pool switches to become the female only pool and vice versa). Apparently the sight of two gaijin in moderate states of undress was enough to ruin one old lady's day, and she slammed the door behind us as we left.  This sort of moodiness is all the more disturbing in Japan because it is so rare. Ho h
