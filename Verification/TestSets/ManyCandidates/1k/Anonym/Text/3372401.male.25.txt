me, but I did buy oranges from him at a stop light once.  Do you see a pattern forming here? I do, stop annoying me with bad cover songs you cock sucker.
Dear Kelly Osbourne,  You are a fat no talent hack. If your father wasn't famous you'd be sucking cock for ham sandwiches. I heard you checked into rehab because you had a pill popping problem. It's a safe guess you weren't abusing Trimspa. I sympathize with your plight. I mean if my parents were filthy and rich, I gained fame off of the exploitation of my zombie like father, was given a record contract because I did a bad cover of a Madonna song, was handed everything in life, became a star for being a rag and had cankles, I'd need to abuse drugs as well.  Maybe you should just end it all. You're gonna be fighting the demons for the rest of your life. I'll even help you out by writing a suicide note for you. Here goes:       I, Kelly Osbourne can no longer go on. I'm a mess physically and mentally. I'm fat and ugly. I have no talent whatsoever. Life is so unfair. I wanted a Hummer H2 for completing rehab but Mum got me a Lexus SUV instead. My album was horrible, my live performances were even worse. I can't stand the cameras from the show around all the time, but I had to sign up for another season because I have no talents other than being annoying and sweating. I've never had a boyfriend that hasn't used me for either money or fame. This isn't the first time that I've thought about killing myself. I tried to hang myself last week, but I'm so fat that the rope snapped when I dropped off of the bed. I was gonna try again but I got hungry so I went down to the kitchen and ate a box of twinkies and a newborn baby's soul. But I'll press on and figure out a way to get this done somehow. I don't know what else to say.... It's better to burn out then to fade away... Mom, Dad I'll miss you... Ronald McDonald I'll miss you too...  There you go Kelly, you're handed something else in life. It's fitting isn't it.
I am so sick of all of these Truth commercials that dominate TV. Kids that think they are clever because they are telling people that cigarettes can give you cancer, whining bitches complaining that their fathers died of lung cancer and blaming "big tobacco" for it. Maybe they should blame the dipshits who didn't read the Surgeon General's warning on the side of every pack of smokes. They should be clubbed in their stupid heads, media whores that they are.   Cigarettes can kill you, as can too much red meat, sex without a condom, and a whole bunch of stuff that makes life worth living. If you live in fear of the fun stuff are you really alive? I think not. That is the truth according to S
