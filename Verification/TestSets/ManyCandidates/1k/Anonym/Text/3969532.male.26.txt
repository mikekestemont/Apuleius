where all problems have solutions, and love conquers all. I know she's frustrated, but I'm frustrated too. I kinda feel like she has created her best facade thingy yet to run away. She told me she was a runner from conflict and challenges from the jump. Everytime she tried to run on me before I grabbed her by the ponytail and brought her back. But this time she somehow tied my hands behind my back so that I cant grab her ponytail, and then she took off. Lil slick heifer. But she dont know who I be does she? I'm T to the mu'fuckin'....I cant un-do my hands sweetie.....I really can.... I'll let you get a couple of steps ahead, but you's mine Kunta!
So right now, KK and I are kinda in the middle of a fuss. So of course it's been on my mind all day. I got to thinking on how sometimes KK and I dont always understand where each other is coming from. Things that appear soooo obvious to me may not be for her and vice versa. Feel me? So then I got to thinking how understanding between males and females kinda parallels that of different races like blacks and whites. Like you know how your average white person thinks blacks have it better nowadays. And while we do I guess in comparison to 40 years ago, shit still aint equal,  ya know? So I was thinking on how like a young white person can not fathom the police being a threat. But if you are young black male you know about that all too well. Like a white person will argue you down that racial profiling doesnt exist, and if so they've never seen it. And it's like 'Cuz you aint the one it's happening to!!!'. But the thing is they dont live in it,  so the concept is hard to grasp. But that dont mean it doesnt exist just cause they cant understand it, dig it? And it's the same thing with a man and a woman. Both sexes go through certain things that the other doesnt understand and most times dont recognize. And so that leads to unintentional insensitivity on the others part and then that leads to shit hitting the fan....HARD, and then you are in the middle of a fuss, and then you feel bad cause you dont really wanna be in the middle of a fuss with your sweetie. You just wanna be with your sweetie. But Kweli said it best when he said "Women say men are trife. Men say women is. We just dont understand our fundamental differences. I'm still learning 'em. Actually I just do what comes naturally."
Hey there. You people out there reading along? So on my other blog on myspace I said I'd be finding just a regular ol blog spot....to kind of not be on a site used for dating and meeting folks cuz that wasnt my intention. (Contrary to what you may be believe Ms. K) So here it is ladies and gentleman....'Teej S
