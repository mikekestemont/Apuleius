made him scream blue murder., then he turned his wrath on J, and treated us al to a tirade, which included how he was going to commit suicide when he got older, and that would teach us all a good lesson, except it wouldn't because we'd be HAPPY (this is I raving).  And it went on and on, and escalated way out of proportion.  I just didn't know what to say, prayed for wisdom, but I think God said no, or hopefully he said wait, because I don't feel much wisdom yet that is sure and certain.    Asked tentatively this morning if he felt any better, and he said that he did, so here's hoping.  I hope he is having a good day at school, I hate to think of hium unhappy.  He is very extreme, it isn't snowing, its BLIZZARDING.    As for me, my carpal tunnel syndrome (self diagnosed) is getting worse, so I've made an appointment ot see the doctor next week.  Hope there is some miraculous cure for it.  The girls and I went to Lincraft this morning, and got fabric for more sleeping bags - polar fleece being on special at the moment.  Business is going well.  Once I sell all the bags out of this material, I should be in the black.
I thought that blogging would make me more disciplined with my writing, but ti isn't working out that way really.  Of course,the fact that I am generally sitting here with G either attached to the boob, or otherwise sitting on my knee, occupying one hand probably doesn't help.  And, I have had a lot of sewing to do.  I got three orders last week - all finished now, and looking gorgeous.  I am so impressed with the things I've made, I can't stop looking at them to tell the truth.  I hope it will all take off and be a success, because I am liking doing it.  I sewed all Sunday afternoon, and let J deal with the kids.  It was actually very nice to sit and sew, and if they asked me for stuff, I just pointed them in his direction.  I think he finds it hard to coordinate them all, with their different needs.  B is fairly demanding, what 2 year old isn't?  And then G is lots of hands on stuff too.  Margot visited on Saturday, and we all went to Euroka Clearing for lunch.  It's always so peaceful there, and there were kangaroos, the kids love that.  Actually, I do too.  David hopped about pretending to be a kangaroo, to try and get closer to them - it didn't work, they knew kangaroos don't wear blue denim.  B kept running after them shouing "Kangaroooo", she was quite exultant.    Margot managed to offend Isaac, by telling him she didn't want one of his Isaac fruit delights, as it sounded horrible, then wouldn't apologise because she couldn't see why that was rude.    Better go, will right more again later.  G is weeping, I think there are nappies to change and baths to r
