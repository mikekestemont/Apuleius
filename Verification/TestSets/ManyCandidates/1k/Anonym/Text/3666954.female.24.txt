by bulking up their sorry excuse for a copy editing staff.   But I digress...it's just a fucking ridiculous thing to debate.&nbsp; The point is: how can you confuse the pronunciation of the letter "i" with an "uh" sound?&nbsp; I mean, the dictionary should have just&nbsp;annotated it&nbsp;"by the local hilljacks" instead of "by some residents".   Madness.
A news story broke this weekend about the ongoing of our fair president's plans to manipulate our government further. Please take the time to read this story from  urlLink CNN  today.  My question is how is delaying the election  NOT  affecting the election?!    HELLO!!!    It seems to me that a pre-emptive action such as  delaying  an election from the appointed date due to an alleged "terrorist threat" (similar to the alleged ones that  didn't  happen on Christmas and the 4th) is doing  exactly that . Who even knows if there were said threats on Christmas & the 4th?  It would seem to me that a matter of national security on our day of independance would be more in need of postponement, I mean, due to the mass gatherings of people that there were in commemoration of democracy's 228th year.  I don't even know why I waste my breath.  It's all so suspect, and no one even seems to be paying attention.  What's worse, is the ones who  are  paying attention get laughed off as "paranoid."  The truth is, if there ever was a seriously imminent terrorist threat, it's not like the general public will ever be privy anyway...that's the beauty of this administration.  We know what they want us to know.  That's not paranoia speaking, that's   fact  , brother.  We're all so easily led under a shroud of mystery and fear - and we have no choice but to eat the shit constantly shoveled down our throats.  With the republicans owning both houses & the presidency, and the minority leader in the Senate being such a puny little coward (yeah, I'm talking about you, Daschle, you fucking idiot)...it certainly seems that Bush can (and will) have his way no matter what.   Which begs the question: is this country REALLY ruled by democracy? After all, a dictatorship would be a whole lot easier, heh, Bush?   GOD, I just wish this fucking country would WAKE UP and SMELL THE BULLSHIT!!!
I expected better of my fellow residents.  Just when I thought this place was okay, something like  urlLink this  happens.  I know it was naive to think that a gay marriage ban  wouldn't  pass in the state of Missouri...I just felt so strongly that there was  no way  the straight residents of Missouri (a majority by far) could be that harsh to their fellow men &amp; women solely based on the fact that they are different.  I thought the world had evolved enough with all the strides made in the name of  urlLink civil rights  over the past century that something like this amendment would be recognized as disgusting act of bigotry.  Well, I was wrong...I'm too disappointed to be angry right now, so I'll write more when I a
