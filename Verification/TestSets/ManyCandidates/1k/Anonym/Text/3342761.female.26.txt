stop "keeping his options open" as Laura has accused him of doing.  Hornby's story is full of humor, character, lists and lots of music.  Each time musicians and their songs were mentioned, I yearned to play samples for background music as I read.    The characterizations were always realistic and quirky but not comically overdone.  It's an ages-old tale - boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back - but Hornby's rendition is wry, wistful and true to life.  If this book had come out a few years later, it would be labeled by publishers as "Lad Lit" in the current marketing ploy aimed to sell male-point-of-view relationship stories to the same "singletons" who embraced Bridget Jones and the like.    But Nick Hornby's  High Fidelity  can stand on its own as a fun, quirky, honest story about love, without the marketing ploys.     Verdict:
Author: Ann B. Ross   Genre: Mainstream Fiction/Mystery/Humor    Review:   Those keeping a close watch on my reading habits may have noticed that I'm drawn to reading clusters of books by the same author.  The truth is that I can't let go of characters I liked and  must  read every book where their name is uttered or else I feel in some way incomplete.  I believe blame for this malady may be placed on my mother who purchased for my very first  urlLink  Baby-Sitter's Club   book back in the day.  That book started a sick obsession with fictional characters--so much that I wished that I was one of them.  Oh, to be a baby-sitter with insignificant problems and yearly vacations...*sigh*  Sick obsessions aside, my adult tastes have changed every so slightly, and while I no longer get my rocks off on teeny bopper three-hour novels, I do scratch and bite over books like the  Miss Julia  series because I still am unable to let go of characters I like.  Although I'm not typically a fan of mystery novels, I didn't realize this  was  one until after I finished it--a little temporary brain-fartitude for ya.  While in the first book in the series,  Miss Julia Speaks Her Mind  established that the Southern woman's place is  not  one of Civil War era of servitude to everyone but herself,  Miss Julia Takes Over  is a humorous reminder that taking the high ground is harder but will create less dirt to sweep under the rug.  As a woman, I also caught Ross's subtle hint that jealousy may be a useful tool in driving a lady to  beat the crap out of some skank  acquire the gentleman of her choice.  For those more interested in Lillian, Lloyd, and Hazel Marie, they return as well with their usual mannerisms and quirky conversational traits.  I could just wrap them up with a little bow and love them and squeeze them and ... name them "George."   Verdict:     Fine literature?  No.  But I love Miss Julia.  I can think of a couple of people just like her...  It's a good beach read.  Incidentally, if you go to the beach, I'd like to come.  I promise to be very q
