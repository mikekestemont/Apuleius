Hi and Welcome to my blog... Yeah right, more like "Fuck you, you coward. Got problem come find me lah!" Oh wells, can't be bothered with pricks like anonymous...  Anyway, Not Yet jammed again today in preparation for teachers day concert... Performing The Reason by Hoobastank as 1 song, as for the other, haven't really decided yet.. Jamming again tomorrow to decide on song... Well, singing The Reason was rather OK at first, but after 5 times or so den couldn't hit the bloody high part... I could hit it perfectly during first three runs, but guess throat got dry... Oh wells.. Shall get Pi Pa Gao sweets... They work... Hehe...  Ahhh... tired man... shall go sleep liao...
Hah! Juz came back from the movie awhile ago... The Village was not bad, but the ending spoiled it... It's a rather complex movie, with the sub-plot being the main plot in the end.  Shan't reveal too much here. But it was great to be with her... =D hehe... am happy! too bad we couldn't have tea together... oh wells, next time ba... there will definitely be a next time and many more next times to come... oh wells... hehe... =D
Ok... I'm rather happy now... Well, the first thing: I FINALLY GOT HER OUT! Wheeeee.... Going to Cine to watch The Village on Tuesday, sorry guys, cant join u ppl @ Taka for lunch... =P wahhahahahaha... Secondly, Not Yet has got out FIRST SINGLE recorded, although it was a rather sucky voice recording and i din sing that stupid *^$%&%*&amp;%^% song well (it was qing tian btw, but i dun sing that kinda songs).  Well it all happened like this, we wanted to use Vinci's mp3 player to record, but it sucks, with all that static shit.  So we got Goh to set up recording system with 2 condenser mics and NO MIXER for us.  Den my Mic and Amp screwed up, so i virtually had to sit below the condenser mics and 'shout' into the mics to get enuff volume.  BUT, shithead mic cant pick my voice up, damn farking soft and i din sing it all that well.  I screwed up 2 parts, but ok lah... Perhaps we should have recorded Heal Me instead, DAMNATION! Oh wells, but anyway we've got our first single recorded... yay.. =P
Hi again, as u all can see, i'm tireded.  Severely tireded... Still got Kevin's Lit Essay havent do leh, no choice, gotta hand it in to him on thursday first thing in the morening. Hope he doesnt get mad (sorry Kevin!).  Managed to finish and hand in Edmund's essay today, happy.  Not Yet is going hardcore jammin and practice man!  Hopefully GohSJ will be able to get trainers for us to train as a band.  Currently each of us have skills, but band dynamics is still a bit lacking.  Once we can get it right, we should be fine! Coolios... Hopefully the RG rock concert proposal goes through... It'll be cool... Anyways i gtg sleep now... *YaWnz* nite nite!  oh well, still miss Her leh.. =
