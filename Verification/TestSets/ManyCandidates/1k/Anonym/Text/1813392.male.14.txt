needs a serious overhall.  One point of slight editorializing in the article that I would argue against:   Mr. German's account of what he considers undue restraint in pursuing terrorism leads may give pause to civil libertarians who have accused the F.B.I. of rushing to judgment and using overly aggressive tactics in some terror cases.   First of all, I would say that's for the civil libertarians who read the article to decide, not the reporter who wrote the article. I don't think this situation is exactly analogous to other cases either, as it's unclear why exactly the FBI would go to such lengths to prevent the investigation German was supposedly pushing for.  So what do you guys think? Who's telling the truth here, German or the FBI? If German's allegations are correct, what the hell is the FBI thinking, and how do we fix it?
First people wanting to hear Cheney speak had to  urlLink pledge their loyalty to Bush.  The article claims it's for security reasons, which seems only slightly probable. But as  urlLink Talking Points Memo  points out,  urlLink this article  tells a slightly different story.   Yier Shi, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee in Washington, D.C., said today's rally was meant to reward and enthuse Bush-Cheney supporters, not to be a forum to preach to skeptics.  Democrats, independents and others were welcome to attend the speech, he saidâ€” as long as they like Bush and Cheney.   Which, of course, fits right in with their policy of securing the conservative base that would vote for them anyways, while ignoring the swing voters.  So where does  urlLink this story  fit in? The Bush campaign says it was for security reasons, and I at the moment I think that's probably correct, but that doesn't exactly mean they were necessary or appropriate security measures. Popat is, as the article says, a photographer with six year's experience working on assignment from a newspaper.  As for the actual content of Cheney's speech, from  urlLink this article,  it looks like he centered it mostly around the war on terror, an ironic decision considering that terrorism's been consistently on the rise ever since the start of the "war on terror."  Interesting quote:   We are doing everything in our power to defend against a terrorist attack on our homeland."   It could just be my imagination, but it seems like that sentence was fairly carefully worded. "On our homeland." It's true that we haven't suffered a terrorist attack since 9/11 on the actual US mainland, but what about Iraq? What about Spain, Afghanistan, and Saudi Arabia? What about Israel? Outside of America, terrorism is having a field day, and the past few years have been some of the worst ever in terms of international terrorism. Much of this can be blamed on Bush's reckless foreign policy (if anything, Al Qaeda started showing up in Iraq only after we invaded), but is he doing a good job with the war on terror?  Well of course. As Cheney says, there haven't been any attacks on the homeland, and that's what m
