first fan." I even ran into the bathroom and gave myself hi-five in the mirror.    Then I got back in touch with the real world. I think the very fact that I even take the time to 'blog' is a direct indication of my propensity to (be a) bore. But thanks for reaffirming.   Speaking of something that is assuredly NOT boring, it seems the occult arts are as potent as many an adept thought. Why? Simply stated, Yngwie Malmsteen has been successfully channeled (no, he's not dead, but his career  is (and was always already) dead)into a Finnish neo-classical death-thrash outfit, aptly named the Children of Bodom. Granted, the cacophonous quintet is not new, but as I have had my head up the ass of progressive house for the past 7 years, I have missed some of the stellar non-Nu:Metal acts of the late 90's. CoB fucking rock and have reinvigorated my love of palm-muting, arpeggios, keyboard solos, and Odin.   Nostalgic quote of the year: "You owe me a new stopwatch you pussies!"--Goldie Hawn, Wildcats
I ran across this review of S.O.D. - Speak English Or Die on Amazon the yesterday; it seems somewhat relevant given today's hairy entanglements both at home and abroad.    "A music fan" writes, "I remember the day 'Speak English or Die' hit the scene when I was in high school. There was a real division beginning between punkers and metal heads where I was at and part of it was because of the violence from nazi skinheads beating up metal heads for having long hair. Since regular skinheads were kind of considered punkers and hard to tell apart from nazis, alot of metal heads were getting pissed at punks in general.  Some of my better friends were head bangers and we were all bummed about the whole affair. Well, when we heard 'United Forces' come ripping from the vinyl in a vocal and chord crunching assault testifying that '...it doesn't matter how you wear your hair, it's what's inside your head...' we were stoked.  Here was this band, 2500 miles from where we were at, talking about the same problem tellin' everybody to lighten up. I listened to this album exclusively for almost a half a year, and there was a lot of killer music then. As far as I'm concerned, these guys are the god fathers of speedcore and if you don't own it, at least hear it once. These guys were a major influence on metal to come!!"   Just remember, it doesn't matter how you wear your hair when everyone is united. Godbless the Crossover. Lighten the fuck up everyone. Learn English and Beware the Milano Mosh.  Although, I must impart one rejoinder. The process of crossover, while undoubtedly for the better in the long run, will produce some abhorrent mostrosities as it unfolds. See for instance D.R.I. post-1987. I mean, the video for "Suit and Tie Guy"--c'mon guys.
urlLink Pure genius...   Although, I'm not sure this version of the theme outdoes Lion's. Now, if someone would do a TRON-esque b-boy battle, i could die c
