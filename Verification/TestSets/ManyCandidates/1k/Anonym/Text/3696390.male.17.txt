meant and people are just going to have to fucking get over it because the truth hurts.  Yeah no one knows what you're goign thru... big deal. no one knows what I'm goign thru or what other people are  going thru but we don't pop pills, or try and physically harm ourselves because that is just stupid.  I'm sorry but taking the easiest possible way out is for those with little self worth.  So let's not fuckin get into this shit again because I don't feel like dealing with it.  we all need to grow a fucking set, quit being selfish, and quit pitying ourselves.  But most of all grow up.    There the show's over, post what you want my decision that people need to grow up is final.

Hello again everyone, it's been I believe at least a week since i have posted on the site so i better bring you up to date with what has been going on in my life.  Well there really hasn't been anything exciting in my as of yet, I'm still a single guy just living and having fun.  But you know it would be nice to have a girl, I've been working on it somewhat but not really because i'm still unsure of what exactly i want.  Oh well, once school starts up at NKU i'm sure that i'll meet someone who i can connect with really well.  I can't wait to start college it's going to be awesome.    Today I worked an 11-hour day when i was only suppossed to work for 5 so that pissed me off a little bit, but when you're manager that happens.  Other shitty thing is, I didn't get paid jack shit because I didn't sell a damn thing today... I've never seen a mall so dead before.  But it's cool I'm finally gettign to move closer to home when I go to florence.  Well I don't really have anythign to say so I'm going to just head out and chill out until I don't know w
