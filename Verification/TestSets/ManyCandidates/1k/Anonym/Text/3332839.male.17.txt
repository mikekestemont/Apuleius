i dunno whats wrong with my head... but im gonna stray off the whole punk/crust thing the next couple posts... it seems like everyone is depressed lately... you know reality can be a bigger trip than being fucked up sometimes? im all scared about facing reality sometimes... and like the fact i dont have certain things its hard to live without... like jenny, or true hapiness... i always seem to fool my self into being well off and happy, but when it boils down to it... i look at the bigger picture... and i really stop kidding myself. and it just sucks.    The United States is one of two remaining industrialized nations to still use death as a form of punishment. There are approximately 3,000 prisoners currently living on Death Row. No other country in the world has this many of it's citizens awaiting execution. If you support capital punishment you support absolute political control at it's sickest extreme. Murder, murder, murder, murder Why must we continue to murder Those who've been convicted of murder Enforced under the lie that it's deterrent of murder Justifies their fucking murder Sentenced to die Sentenced to death Capitol punishment A tool of the terrorist It's nothing more than a political weapon It's not a deterrent It's not a prevention Kill one man Spare another Our justice system is based on color Examine the facts You have to face it The American's crime An eye for an eye will leave the whole world blind Politicians who seek enhancement look towards murder for career advancement They prey on fear and insecurity To win support of the majority Endorsing murder under false perceptions Being tough on crime helps win elections They're playing God They have no right It's premeditated political sacrifice It's not about a murder or a crime committed Not what was done, but who fucking did it It's not about law or even justice It's all about race and economic status You can't judge a person by a stereotyped race You have to look at the individual case No life's returned by an execution Another death is no solution Their justice system is just our burden The way they treat the average person What about murder by government agents Not capital punishment or even containment These political pawns get away with murder They're servants to the new world order You'll see no outside intervention Not a single death recommendation  music:Aus Rotten-capital p
