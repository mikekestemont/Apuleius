I saw the weirdest thing today, I was at the gas station while at work today and after filling up my work truck, I pulled out of the pump area and prepared to drive away, but I noticed a beast of a woman about 30 feet away screaming at some other trashy tramp in a mustang. I sat and just watched, since I don't see this type of activity every day (except on Jerry Springer). The beast was screaming in the window of the tramps car, and then the tramp got out and then got into the face of the beast who in turn pushed her against the car and the two of them started to push each other and doing these female windmill type slapping movements upon each other. I was enjoying this until the tramp got back in her car and drove off. I think more gas stations should have entertainment such as females fighting to entertain patrons or at least me. It's the least they could do since the friggin gas prices are out of this world. But if you folks at mobil or shell are listening, please let the fighters be between 19 and 24 in good shape and wearing bikini's.. I guess when I start having gas station fantasies then its time I goto bed.. Cya I'll write more as this crazy life unfolds..
urlLink Knievel Tour 2004: The Legend Continues : "Robbie Knievel "  Got to watch Robbie Knievel jump the USS Intrepid tonight.  All my life i've been a fan of his father the ultimate daredevel, Evel Knievel. Robbie did a pretty good job tonight, he jumped over fighter jets and rescue helicopters that were placed on the deck of the ship. My only fault of the show was how producers have to draw out the tv special for an hour when they could have wrapped it up nicely in 30 minz.  Ahh well thats why I fix tv's for a living and not be on them. Until more life happens..

urlLink The Village -- The Official Movie Website   Well another boring day has come and gone.  I've been waiting to see M. Night Shamalamadingdongs movie "The Village." This movie was awful. My wife slept thru the first 45 minz. I had high expectations of what this movie would turn into, but was let down. I won't give any of it away, but let it be known that it out right sucks. Afterwards we went up to Ledo Pizza and got pizza and came home to watch what is seasonally our favorite show Big Brother. Thank God Diane won the HOH contest. It is nice not having a favorite person to win this show, but at the same time it is nice having those two fag's scott & jase to hate. Christ, I can't get into how queer those two are. Bring back Holly!!  She was as smart as my left shoe, but is/was the hottest poa on tv..  ahh well. More to come as life h
