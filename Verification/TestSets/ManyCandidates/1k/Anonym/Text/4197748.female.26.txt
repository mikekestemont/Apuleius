 SO, I got all that annoying stuff taken care of -- license, registration, tags, title, voter registration, blah, blah, blah. It's amazing how similar the DMVs are in different states.  Long lines, lots of steps in the process, lots of shady-looking people.  I'm wondering if there's a secret DMV location where all the classy people go, 'cause I didn't see any of those types this morning.  Yup, it was pretty much the monster-truck-shirt-and-camouflage-mesh- trucker's/hunter's-hat-wearing folks with buckteeth.  I know it sounds mean, but I only say that since they also acted completely obnoxious!!  For example, fighting and slapping/elbowing each other; and these are adults I'm talking about (I don't know if they were brother/sister or husband/wife or what).  Truly amazing. Oh and back to the vision test.  There was an older woman who couldn't pass the test either.  Not surprising, though, since she couldn't even see her daughter from 5 feet away.  And she wants a driver's license??!!
I waited in the line at the DMV for 30-40 minutes (after driving all over the county trying to find the place where I could do both my license and registration in the same visit), then proceeded to FAIL my vision test!!!! AAAAAHHHH! So, I'll go back this morning, armed with my glasses, and try again (I have an astygmatism in my left eye, but I've never really had trouble with the driver's license vision tests without them. I don't think the glasses help all that much, but we'll see.). If that doesn't work, I guess I'll have to go to the eye doctor and get a better prescription. Yuck, yuck, yuck!
Hmm, where to begin...The chaos of my recent long-distance move has subsided and I like the new apartment a lot (barring yesterday's "fire" alarms -- one in the afternoon and another around midnight;  at least we know the ridiculously loud, high-pitched squealing noise effectively wakes everyone up).  This better not become a common occurrence in my building here, because it can be tricky when you're sound asleep.  There I was, off in dreamland (actually dreaming about a Scarlet Letter-type situation I had somehow gotten myself into, which involved some Puritans, some Quakers and an ex-boyfriend of mine...yeah, good times) when the alarm was somehow activated.  Once I woke up, it took me a while to figure out what was going on, then I had to find a sweater and shoes so as not to indecently expose myself.  Found a sweater (still half asleep, so I gave up on the shoes) and my keys and headed outside (thought about all the things I may have grabbed should there have been a real fire, i.e., cell phone, laptop).  Never really got an explanation for the alarm's activation, but oh well.  Maybe we have a prankster on our hands???   I'm looking forward to getting my class schedule, but not looking forward to shelling out all the cash for books.  In fact, I better add those books to my list of things to grab in the event of a fire.  Any suggestions on law school book s
