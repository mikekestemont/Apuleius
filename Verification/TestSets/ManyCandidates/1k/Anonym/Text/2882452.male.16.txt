: "Tarquin, get in the office. If i see Partario his text speaking arse won’t see another Physics lecture..."  [The door is opened a crack, immediately a massive jet of water rushes past Richard, who feels the coolness in the air as the water sails into the server of the Croo's computers]  Siegfried "Quentin, get them out of here!"  [As Richard dives into the office, Quentin slams the door, a second blast of water splashing into the frosted glass of the door. He ushers them out of a backdoor, where they split up. Richard runs back to his dorm, hoping to get an email out to TSGOF about the compromise of security.]  Partario : "Hi tark."  Richard : "What are you doing here?"  Partario : "lol i waz opin 2 c 1 of u lot cos i av to gve you dis."  [Partario hands Richard a card. Written on one side is "WE IZ GONNA OWN YOUR NOOB ASSES IN AN EVENIN' MASSACAR INNIT 730 - LATE BE DARE AND DIE (Light lunch and buffet provided)"]  Richard : "Get out of here traitor."  [Partario smirks and walks off.]  [In his dorm, Richard conducts his routine check for bombs and contact poison, before clicking the screensaver off of his laptop. The web still functions, as does his MSN and Email accounts. He signs on to his MSN account, and sees two contacts online : DickyBod http://dickybod.blogspot.com, and Quentin@htmlcroo.com. He double-clicks Quentin's name, and begins to type.]   Richard : "Heard of this Evening Massacre?"  Quentin : "Hold on, let me add someone..."  Richard : "10-4"  I HATE DA CROO has been added to the conversation  Alexandra : "Hi ho Tarkers :D"  Richard : "Hi. What’s happening regarding the Massacre"  Alexandra : "It's already been officially listed on the site as a Grudge Match, so no outside help can be listed in. TSGOF can still participate, since we're a registered sister wing of your guild, but that means the Rood's can do the same"  Richard : "Meaning...?"  Quentin : "While we could draft the help of TSGOF, that would allow the Rood's to utilise their brother and sister guilds, and we'd be outnumbered. The best odds we could get is if we went it alone."  Richard : "Hm... How's the English room?"  Quentin : "Dry, and the waterproofing of the server and computers helped stop any damage to our communications. Guys i must be off, i have a Physics lecture in 10"  Richard : "10-4"  Alexandra : "Bye de bye"  Quentin : "Oh, Tarquin, get to the room when you can, Cuthbert may have something very useful for you."  Alexandra : "Ok, GOODBYE NOW!!!"  Quentin@htmlcroo.com has left the conversation  Alexandra : "Don't go"  Richard : "Why, Cuthbert’s not that bad, unless you let him talk..."  Alexandra : "No, you primitive male, to the Massacre!"  Richard : "What? Why?"  Alexandra : "Have you ever seen the write-ups of any rood's guild fight to date? They're dangerous, and I don't think Quentin knows it."  Richard : "I can't back out now. Watch the site."  -OFFLINE-   -
