when I return home in October.  That reminds me, I need to get my tickets soon.  Well, after this gymnastics competition is over, I am going to try and get some sleep.  Later!
Good morning! It's early Monday morning here, and I just finished cleaning the bathroom and took a shower. I haven't dried off since the first shower I took here. It is so warm that you are almost always sweating. I really don't notice the heat, I actually enjoy it now. It's nothing that a couple of fans can't fix. Of course, the breeze at 22 floors up helps, too. The apartment seems to be set up so there is almost a wind tunnel between the living room and the master bedroom. The hallway is fairly long, and we have fans set up at the ends of it. I have learned not to like air conditioned buildings - the temperature contrast makes you notice the heat more. When I watched the news tonight, the humidity was 78%, which is less than it is back home. Looking at the extended forcast, it is supposed to be a solid 90 degrees the next week. I love it here :)  I found a really cool web site last night while I was trying to see if I could find a cached copy of my old web site. Check this out, a site that goes out and saves copies of different versions of web sites. It doesn't save the pictures, but it does save the text and formatting.  urlLink http://www.archive.org/web/web.php  That's pretty cool.  I've been watching the Olympics tonight, and I was kind of glad to see the US basketball take a fall like it did tonight. I think it's good for them to have their egos slapped around a bit. My favorite event of the evening was probably water polo. That's a fairly entertaining sport to watch. Right now it's just a bunch of blah blah blah. That reminds me, I have this TIVO type of thing that is a part of the digital cable box, so I can just fast forward through this. There, now it's women's swimming. Haha technology rocks.  I'm off to play on pogo.com. Have a good day! Chey
My apartment overlooks H1, Hawaii's "interstate" (think about that one for a second, they actually have it labeled that way.)  I can tell what time it is by the backup of the traffic.  From my observations, if you want to get anywhere in Honolulu (10th largest city in the US), don't drive while it's light out.  The highway starts backing up around 5:00am and clears up by 9:00am, then backs up again around lunchtime, then again at 2:30pm and clears up around 7:00pm.  It's only going to get worse now that the University of Hawaii is back in session.  I'm glad I don't have to drive anywhere  :)  I really have no rant for the day.  I spent most of my day making lasagna and cleaning.  I ended up winning that violin from Ebay, and I'm looking forward to getting i
