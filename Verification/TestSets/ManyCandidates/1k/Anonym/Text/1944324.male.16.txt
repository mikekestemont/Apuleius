have considerably less hair than usual, and have recieved much congratulation on shaving quite a bit of my hair for a single scene. It doesn't look that bad, actually, and is pleasently soft and fuzzy, though a bit cold. Despite its advantages, it will be grown to its original length. I could get used to it being incredibly short, but two days before cutting it i had it in cornrows and it looked awesome! The day after that, only half was shaved. Nathan's idea, we had a few different explainations to toss out at anyone who asked, my favourite being that we were running late and could only shave half. We will have pictures, for anyone interested.  Explanation on the new template: Nathan and I had an arguement about one of the prostitute costumes. I said she looked like a ninja prostitute and he insisted she was a pirate. The arguement was long and rather pointless.  There aren't Arabian ninjas, they just wear the same pants!
Wow.  Thank you Nathan for that rousing rendition of "The Lion Sleeps Tonight".  I don't think I'll ever be able to listen to that song the same way again. In other news, I'm alive!  Kinda.  I know I quit and then came back and didn't post and blah blah blah...sorry about all that.  I've been working this summer!  Actually WORKING!  Did you think that was possible?  And at school, no less.  I've been working for the registrar and in the bookstore...fun stuff, eh?  But I stopped doing that because I strained my back lifting books and stuff.  Just think about that when you go to registration you LC folks...I hurt myself so that ya'll could get books.  :D  Just kidding.  But it's gonna be funky this year...all the books are in the Studio Theater and you're going to get them at Registration.   You LN people are lucky.  But I got money for our stupidity, so it's all good.  Anyway, I hope my posting isn't too weird for all of you...I'm just bored and don't really have much to do.  Sorry.  Bye!   There aren't Arabian ninjas, they just wear the same pants!

I seriously think it could work as a musical.  The "weiner wort", of course, refers to what they put in the sausages.  It's a great book, but it'll be weeks before I can eat another sausage.  In other news, guess what one of our numbers for the fall choir show is gonna be?  Hint: It was the title of an episode of  Sports Night .  There aren't Arabian ninjas, they just wear the same p
