in the ditch and then the afterlife. Our life has to be meaningful-and chasing the wind can be enjoyable. We shouldn't kill ourselves becuse a problem comes along the way. There is always the chance that you will breath again the fresh air of hapiness. I hate when war comes and destroy's people's order of lives.

1) I'm out of estrogen, and I have a gun. 2) Next mood swing, 6 minutes. 3) So many men, so few who can afford me. 4) All stressed out and no one to choke. 5) If they don't have chocolate in Heaven, I ain't goin. 6) My mother is a travel agent for guilt trips. 7) If you want breakfast in bed, sleep in the kitchen. 8) Warning, I have an attitude and I know how to use it. 9) Dinner is ready when the smoke detector goes off. 10) Don't start with me, you WON'T WIN.
