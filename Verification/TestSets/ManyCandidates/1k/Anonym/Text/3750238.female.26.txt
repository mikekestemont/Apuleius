might help too…but it’s doubtful that is ever going to happen. PS-Check out the comment on the post Below "Demon in my Belly".  It's good.
I feel icky...there is a demon in my stomach I think.  I am patiently waiting for it to burst out of my stomach, like Alien....or maybe it would be more like Spaceballs.  I would much rather a singing demon, that would be funny, and then maybe he would take requests.   Oh, so last night Valerie saw that there is going to be a "SlayerCruise".  A bunch of Buffy fans, and actors from the show get on a a cruise ship and go around the bahamas.  Part of me thinks this might be fun...getting to hang with my people and all, going from port to port like a filthy sailor, talking Buffy and meeting people from the show...but the sad truth of it is, I get sea sick...and can you imagine the classiness that is me vomiting all over James Marsters shoes.  Oh, since it's a cruise, he might even be wearing sandles....or (god forbid) be bearefoot!   I know I know, it's a big ship, you barely feel the movement, blah blah blah...but I bet I would. I get sick in the car...I get sick on the T for christ's sake!  Well I do have my magical miracle bracelets, so maybe? Well anyway, back to the stomach demon, it's acting up again...or maybe it's a spell of some sort...it could be witches, some evil witches...I've got a theory....It could be bunnies (or maybe midgets).  I think I'll go medicate it.
Today was the 3 week mark of my going to the gym. They say that once you do something for 3 weeks it becomes habit, so here's to it getting easier to drag myself out of bed at 6am. I think I am finally starting to notice some changes so that is also encouraging. I got Hellboy from netflix, and have been holding it hostage for a good while. I really like that movie. It's such a good time to be a geek right now...so much of the media caters to us. I know it's contrite and used again and again, but you know...the geek will inherit the earth ;-) Geekdom is becoming more mainstream, which could be good or bad, but I am enjoying all the movie offerings that's for sure. I think that the looks I get when I read comics on my lunch at work are getting less strange, though I could be mistaken. ....Um, also, I think I have a bit of a crush on HellBoy...Is that wrong? Hmmm I am noticing a pattern....Gambit, Spike, Hellboy...all bad boys in trench coats. I have a major problem...cause...they are all fictional characters! Dan is so lucky to be with mental case me.   Again...I will let that quotable Xander handle this one...  "It's understandable. Spike's strong and mysterious and sorta compact but well muscled." - Xander   "Xander I'm not having sex with Spike, but I'm starting to think you might be." - the other Buffy   --Intervention (I b
