in 1941. I'll try to keep this short, but let me quickly summarize things for those who have not heard of the camps:   Immediately following Pearl Harbor and the death of over 2,000 American military personnel, the State Dept took action to capture and detain 120,000 Issei (1st generation) and Nissei (2nd generation) Japanese, putting them into internment camps all around the continental US and off the coast of the Hawaiian island Oahu. The rational behind the racist policy was that all Japanese living in the States - regardless of background - posed a threat to US national securtiy. The state dept. had convinced themselves that "democratic institutions were incompatible with the Japanese philosophy" and thus, all Japanese living in the US had to be taken out of the system.  While the government was largely targeting Japanese citizens rather than US-Japanese citizens, the majority of these detainees were hardworking laborers in Hawaii and California who had lived in the US for years and even decades with their American-born children and wives. They did not and could not obtain US citizenship due to the 1924 Exclusion Act - (a law which imposed quotas on  the number of specific immigrant groups and all together denied citizenship to Japanese immigrants) - and thus were doomed to live permanently as "alien residents." These detainees were trapped by US law with no chance to defend themselves. They were stripped from their families (along with the Nissei) and sent to live in concentration camps for 3-4 years. Concentration camps? Wasn't that Nazi Germany? Well, we unfortunately had a few of our own, and even ones with barbed-wire fences.  The story goes on, but I'll leave it by noting that these Japanese internees finally gained the chance to apply for citizenship in 1952, the presidential commission finally concluded in 1981 that the camps were "not justified by military necessity..." and the survivors of the camps finally received some sort of compensation ($20,000) in 1988.   I think the important point to take away from this historical injustice is how easily major civil rights violations and blatant racism can be disguised beneath the rhetoric of national security. 50 years after the fact, we can more objectively evaluate our domestic policy toward residents of Japanese ethnicity and wonder: why didn't the 250,000 or so German aliens living in the US during WWII ever receive such comparable treatment? Surely, the answer is racism. Even the US military commander in California during WWII, General DeWitt , made this clear by justifying the camps with: "A Jap's a Jap -- it makes no difference whether he is an American citizen or not."   Though it is less likely that large-scale historical unjustices such as the Japanese internment camps would occur in the modern era, we still face issues of national security and civil rights. Take, for example, the Patriot Act. While it won't imprison as many as 120,000 residents/citizens without the right to an attorney, it rests upon some of the same "rights of state" that caused the Japanese internment camps. This is very t
