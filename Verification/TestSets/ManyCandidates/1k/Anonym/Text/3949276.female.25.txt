whole trip!!!  OH I forgot!  I did get to go shopping and buy some discounted Lancome Cosmetics!  I was thrilled!  By the time we made it back to the hotel lots of our friends made it to the hotel.  Everyone gathered into our room  Wes had brought Liquor to make drinks in our room.  He ended up creating a new drink.  We named it "Delicious."  How appropriate.  Cran grap, Apple Vodka and Malibu Rum!!  It was great!   At some point we went to sleep but I don't remember those details.  The next morning we all met downstairs for breakfast and several people decided they wanted to go shopping with us.  SO we all piled in my sisters car and made our way to the Expensive Mall.  That is what we called it!  I had my first trip to TIFFANY'S!  I saw my engagement ring!  Though I am no where near that point in my life!  We get back to the hotel and only have 45 mins for 3 people to shower and get ready!  We were 15 mins late to the wedding.  We had to walk in during the middle of the ceremony.  WOOPS!  So we only had to stay at the wedding for 15 mins.  HAHA!!  We had a 2 hour break in between the wedding and reception so we headed back to the hotel for the pre party.  WIth a trip that should have only taken 15 mins ended up taking 1 hour!!!!  I thought I was never going to get out of the car.  It started storming and we missed the last exit before we headed into St. Petersburg which is a 15 min drive over a huge bridge.  It was crazy.  After the pre party we headed to the reception which was open BAR!!!! HOLLAAAA!!!  We made it in time for the coktail hour which we used very well.  I was so drunk by the time we made it into the reception that the room was spinning!!!!!!!!  I have no idea how much we drank..   I am sure when Alli and Joe get their tape of the reception back they will Die of Laughter.  It was crazy fun.  The FOOD Was fabulous.  I don't even know what time we made it back to the hotel but I think it was around 9pm.  We sobbered up enough by 11pm to start drinking again.  My sister had gone to bed and we hit the bottle!  We had so much fun that night.  When we woke up the next morning no one even knew where we had parked the car!  We  were boggled by the thought of where the car was.  By that afternoon we were on our way home with nothing but the road to talk about.  Oh yeah I forgot.  On friday night I went to my first strip club but we did not go in.  The cover was $20 and I am not paying that to see women.  IT was so funny.  We drove up got out and left.  HAHA!!  Tampa is Hella Good!   OUT  DJ S
