give me mind numbing entertainment.  I love music from Bach, Dixie Chicks to Linkin Park.  I love taking a nap in the middle of the day during a thunderstand.  I love the fact the God can be loving, firm, powerful, confusing, frustrating and mysterious at the same time.  I love BBQ, Coca-Cola, Astros baseball (even though they aren't doing very good), playing sports, teaching kids, and animals.  I love to love better than to hate.
I hate politics.  I hate that one party fights against the other just becuase they're the other party.  I hate that important issues like poverty get overlooked for issues over same sex marriage.  Yes you might think that is important but personally I don't think it is more important than feeding a starving child!    I hate Christians pushing stupid issues like prayer in school and hanging the ten commandments in the course room, and I hate liberals pushing the same thing.  I hate that people have to think it is one way or the other and if you don't see it my way well than you're an idiot.    I hate it when I see on the news another child has been abducted, abused in anyway, or murdered.  I hate people who don't use their blinker, speed, ride your bumper and play their bass too loud.  I hate having no money, AIDS, cancer, poverty, ignorance, olives, abuse, stupid people, and living at home.  This is my hate rant.
Today, I went to my home church (only b/c we were leaving to watch a baseball game) and presented before me was a pretty patriotic service.  There were the church slash patriotic songs, they had a procession of the American Flag and the Christians Flag, and I'm pretty sure a patriotic sermon (but we missed that).  Basically all that was missing were the fireworks.  Don't get me wrong, I like being patriotic, but I don't like it at church.  It is more of a personal thing, I like to keep that stuff out of worship service.  To me it seems it should have been more sacred but I felt that line was crossed.  I just don't believe God only blesses America, I know that is probably not the intention of the song but in my experience the way it is presented it is.    So, yes I celebrate the fourth of July but not during the worship service becuase this time to celebrate, lament, kneel, and honor God not America.  FYI, the game was horrible, we got stomped.  Happy 4th of July.
I'm trying to keep up my habit of reading and I want to vary the categories of reading material. The problem is there are so many topics or genres I want to read I can't decide. I want to read something historical, fiction-fantasy, literary classic, philosophical. I also do not know what is good and what is well lame so for the thousands of reader who read this could you give me a list of books you have enjoyed. I just need help getting a jump start here. Thanks a b
