cities.  And of course if that doesn't interest you (which I can't imagine that it wouldn't), then this is kind of fun to play around with for a little while.    http://www.zefrank.com/scribbler/     Have a wonderful monday/tuesday/saturday/sunday - whatever day it is. (:0)
I have definitely stooped to a brand new all time low - I can't stop looking for dirt on Britney Spears. I actually found a website today that spies on her! Shouldn't I be assamed of playing into this drama??? Now, I can't wait to get off work and go buy the new people with her interview about "the engagement".  Ugh, I am disgusting myself. Who really cares if she's engaged or pregnant or having knee surgery? Does she pay my bills? No. Nope. I am just some psycho voyerist or something. Hahaha. Oh, pathetic, I am, absolutely pathetic. Nonetheless, I have provided you with the link just incase you want to make yourself crazy with these antics.   We are FINALLY having some sunshine today in Houston, TX. Yippee. I guess it's only 11:43AM though, so I can't imagine it not starting up this afternoon.  I thought I would share another interesting link with you (this one a lot more interesting) that my mother told me about.  http://www.drudgereport.com/. Don't know if you have accessed it before (more than likely, Lisa knows exactly what I am talking about) but it's really interesting. Just a gossip column that may actually hold some substance. ??? Nonetheless, you can all see I have been working EXTREMELY hard at my new job. Hahaha.  Okay, have a wonderful Thursday! I am off for sushi!
And she's not bad looking either....hahaha. just kidding.

We wound up sitting in the living for about two hours talking about random crap after dinner. They never seem to shock me with all of their weird questions. -another story-  Hmm, nothing much is new. Same 'ole same 'ole, I guess. I went to church yesterday which was nice. Had my little come to Jesus meetin' and that seemed to straighten a few things out in my head (always does). It was a small Methodist church close by my house in Houston. Don't think I will go back to that church but it definitely served it's purpose for me yesterday.  I am going to visit my grandmother this weekend (on Thursday) and I am very much looking forward to that. Just to spend a few days in the country with an out-of-range cellphone and no nonsense is going to be wonderful in general. I am hoping to spend some time eating blackberries and visiting with my little cousins as well.   I should run - must study! Big test (#2) on Thursday! Lots of l
