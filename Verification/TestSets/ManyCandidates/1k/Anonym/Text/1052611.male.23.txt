scream at the horror that looked back at me. My dear mother, on the other hand who was giving the renowned ''hairstylist'' the 50,000 stares (mentioned earlier) while handing out the 120 bucks started off on some big time''Oh, sweetheart don't worry about it. You look just fine. You have to try new styles, you know'' dialogue frenzy. ''Right ho'' I mumbled, now completely convinced that along with looking like a half evolved specimen from the distant lands of planet Zog, I now looked like a  half evolved specimen from the distant lands of planet Zog with weird hair. moral: Don't trust hairstylists who sound morose. They are probably facing serious problems in their lives and want to take their anger out in novel ways; for eg:cutting your hair and making you look more like a monster than the average homo sapien.Amen.
15/05/04 It is time to get your popcorn bowls out and wait for the grand finale. Alright corny I admit but I’m just quoting from that stupid newspaper…yeah! Times of India! For the life of me I can’t figure out the hype that is attached with the whole affair. I mean yes, ‘elections decide the future of this country’…blah…but, what I’m trying to say is that its more like everyone’s betted their lives on who’s going to win the goddamn lottery or something!  BJP lost, Congress won and instead of considering the fact that the former party is headed by an old man who probably has difficulty walking, let alone think of the welfare of a country whose population is one of the largest in today’s world (Incidentally, I don’t know what relevance this has to anything but as a kid; I used to be proud of the fact that India had the second biggest janasankhya. I also used to be proud of the fact that I was living in the largest continent and…OKAY snap out of it you ignoramus I say to myself and get back to the point) I mean, with all due respect to Mr Vajpayijee; I think he did a pretty decent job and everything but I also think that he…err shouldn’t strain himself too much at this…err…ripe old age. So anyway instead of considering all this and looking more optimistically at the whole situation AND acknowledging the fact that maybe Sonia has more to her than an accented language, (I speak as a mere onlooker here, I mean I wouldn’t really know too much about Mrs Gandhi so as to decide whether she would make an able P.M for our country.) what do people do? They crib about her foreign origin!!!  The main point that everyone seems to be missing here is that at least there is a likely possibility that Sonia may not emphasize on all that religion bullshit that the NDA were so intent on. Ah well! What is there to do but to watch and wait…and tell myself to stop being so desperate and do just about anything (which includes writing A class zilch) to get away from that fat physics b
