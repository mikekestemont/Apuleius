urlLink Understand Enterprise Service Bus scenarios and solutions in Service-Oriented Architecture, Part 3 : "In Part 3 of this series on scenarios and solutions for implementing an Enterprise Service Bus, the author examines possible solutions for the various scenarios outlined in Part 2. The ideas on the role of the Bus as explained in Part 1 provide the foundation for the scenarios. "
urlLink Understand Enterprise Service Bus scenarios and solutions in Service-Oriented Architecture, Part 2 : "In Part 2 of this series on the Enterprise Service Bus (EBS), the author describes and analyzes some commonly observed scenarios in which ESBs and other Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) solutions are implemented. "
urlLink Understand Enterprise Service Bus scenarios and solutions in Service-Oriented Architecture, Part 1   This article identifies a set of minimum capabilities that fulfill the most basic needs for an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) consistent with the principles of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). Identifying these minimum capabilities allows you to identify which existing technologies to use to implement an ESB to support an SOA. By considering how the requirements of a specific situation define the need for additional capabilities, you can then choose the most appropriate implementation technology for that situation.
