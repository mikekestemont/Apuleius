know we won't talk as much, we already don't. It's killing me. Jeff was over at her house. She said it was "a goodbye thing". I don't want to know. I don't want her to tell me. I won't freak out again, that was a one-time thing, but I'm still pretty pissed. I want her to make the right decisions but I can't really influence her.  I have no tact, by the way, as evidenced by this:  nay the obscure (9:56:50 PM): [12:51:26] Happily Damned: I only hate you because you're stupid, Nadine. A Thing for Jaz (9:58:00 PM): Hm. It means very, very little coming from me, but I don't think you're stupid. You're the only person who sees through my crap. nay the obscure (9:58:01 PM): :'-( A Thing for Jaz (9:59:13 PM): You aren't stupid. I can see why people would hate you, but that's because of noncompatible personalities.A  Thing for Jaz (9:59:40 PM): Wow, I always manage to say the wrong thing... nay the obscure (9:59:55 PM): yeah, I was thinking that... nay the obscure (9:59:56 PM): =p A Thing for Jaz (10:00:12 PM): Wait, you were thinking that I always say the wrong thing?

I mean, I knew I had no tact, but to have another person say it...I've been trying to keep my mouth shut when I know I'm about to say something tactless, but it doesn't happen. I've been getting worse lately.  Oh, and I've been getting WAY better at controlling my public stupidity. I managed to get through a conversation with Monica without completely going crazy. I need somebody to like, follow me around and smack me when I say dumb things. I mentioned that at the pool party the other day and Monica smacks me in the head and goes, "Shut up." Monica's great.  Yesterday, Jenny says, "Can you stand up if I do this?" and kicked me in the back of the knee. I had my knees locked at the time and like, fell to my knees. I have a huge bruise now, it's hurting to sit. She apologized, and I know she didn't mean to hurt me, so we're OK. But if it happens again, that is IT. Ooh, which reminds me. Conversation I had:  Me: OK, you know what, do that again and I'm going to open up a can. Her: What? Me: A can. Her: Of what?  I've decided to wait to get my ears pierced until my second check. I called my dad and got like 40 dollars towards my contact exam. That was another amusing conversation. Anyway, that gives me about forty more to spend on clothes. I screwed around with my money last year and didn't buy stuff I needed. This year, I'm not making the same mistake.  I need to get started on Dae's rainbow necklace today. I need to mail the bracelet I made her in the first place. Damn lack of s
