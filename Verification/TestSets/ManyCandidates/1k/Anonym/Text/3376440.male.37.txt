can you open for advertisers?   Tomorrow…   AM stations that feel lesser than FMs today will get the last laugh in the digital future, when In-Band-On-Channel multiplexing turns WXXX into WXXX1, WXXX2, WXXX3, WXXX4, etc. It’ll take a few years for new receivers to proliferate, as with UHF TV. But when it does, AM will sound as good as FM, and can offer Americans whose lives keep getting faster and faster just what they want…instant gratification.   Some TV stations have already shown us how, swapping Retransmission Consent rights for a second cable channel they use to constantly replay newscasts, or show logo’d weather graphics. So radio, which will always be the #1 in-car medium, and AM (the information band), will be even more handy and relevant to busy people. While Rush is pontificating on WXXX1, you can be constantly playing and updating your Weather Channel forecast on WXXX2; with neither interrupted by the afternoon baseball game on WXXX3, or the replay of that great interview your morning show had earlier when many listeners might not have been tuned in.   Build key images and encumber programming franchises now, and you’ll be known for them later.   And the answers to your specific questions are…   Q: “3 person morning shows: a good idea?”  A: Hard to generalize, since opportunities vary locally. One advantage of an ensemble: separate vacations. With only one person gone at a time, you’ve never got the “B” team subbing.   Q: “What to pay on-air people?” and “Good incentive/bonus plans for on-air people?”  A: Peg rewards to Sales rather than ratings results. Example: a smart GSM I know preps for a new business pitch by inviting all on-air people to submit spec spots. Then, rather than asking the prospect yes-or-no, the AE asks which spot works best. And the winning talent gets a cash award. Some stations pay talent a small fee for live spots, or a bonus for new accounts renewing. Results can be dramatic.   Q: “Are we playing too many commercials today?”  A: Read The Impact of Higher Spot Loads on Radio Listeners, FREE at www.EdisonResearch.com   Q: “What other incentives do you recommend, other than money?”  A: Whatever you award is most meaningful when it’s recognized as an award, rather than simply an entitlement. But what gratifies on-air people most is so obvious you might overlook it: listen to them. Hey, they talk for a living! Bring them into brainstorming meetings that they otherwise feel left out of. Even if you don’t do everything they suggest, they’ll feel very included; and you’ll get better execution.   Q: “How do you see AM radio competing against digital radio (i.e., XM, CD Radio, etc.)?”  A: National media can never do what solid local radio can: be local.   Q: “How will ‘virtual radio’ (radio on the Internet) impact us?  A: Cyber-surfers have already demonstrated that they’re not as interested in hearing distant broadcast stations as other on-line audio (i.e., the LAX tower talking to pilots). But that’s a novelty, compared to how day-to-days useful a hustling local station can be.   copyright 1999 Holland C
