to shut up now.  I love having an uncomplicated life.  Bye bye!
Happy one month to us... Happy one month to us... Happy one month dear uuuuus... Happy one month to us!  *cheer!*  wheee.  Nope, one month isn't that long, but what a month it has been.  Let's make the next one even better!  * * * *   Today was great +2.  * * * *   Archery is going to be really nice this time (as opposed to "nice" with Wuzzardo).  Ms. Sharp moves fast (in teaching gym classes...).  * * * *   Nothing else to say at 11:00PM on a school night.  Good night.
fah-reaking... Jesus...  This week was insanely long. We worked our asses off in the warehouse and I got my first taste of being out on the road. I almost got my second taste of being out on the road. We had left Ware's and were stopped at a WaWa before leaving, but my dad refused to let me go this time (it was 14k lbs in Wildwood... the dudes weren't back when we left at 5PM today). My brother was following our trailer with another trailer that he was going to drop in Wildwood then go back to Ware's to pick up another trailer, yadda yadda yadda... He took me back to the warehouse and picked up the guy that was originally supposed to go that I was going to replace.  Not only did all that make this the longest week ever, but I highly anticipated Cindy's return this Saturday (tomorrow!!). Less than 24 hours left! Wheeeee!!  Everything is fine, though, since today was pay-day. Yay for $425 gross for only 5 days of work, but then stupid Uncle Sam taking away about $60, bringing my total down to $362.38 ><>  Bye bye
Just seven more days... seven... Then my balance will be restored.&nbsp; wheee!
f'n Wicked music and its f'n "For Good" song...  Everytime I sing (and sometimes just hear) that song when I'm alone I start getting that feeling I want to cry. &nbsp;ya know... that burning in&nbsp;the sinuses and the whole watery eyes thing... ;;&nbsp; It's not full-blown out-loud "whaaaa, whaaaa" crying, but just those little sniffs and hiccup-like heaves...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; weird.  &nbsp; I think I&nbsp;miss Cindy too much ;;&nbsp; I hope her parents will let me go with them at 5:00AM next Saturday to pick her up.&nbsp; But shhhh... Cindy can't know.
Cindy... I miss you.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't wait until you get back...&nbsp; ;;
discover what candy you are @ quiz me    Now that I'm done with forreal answering the questions I'm gonna go back and see what other kind of whacky candy I can become!  wheee!!
Happy 4th of July, people!   I think we're going to go to one of the fireworks displays tonight, but we already saw our first fireworks together last night at... 9:14 (please be the right time...)! yay for airborne explosives!  The Cumberland County Fair starts Monday at 5:00PM!  We're probably going to go there, too.  Maybe we'll see some people.  I need a haircut but I'm too lazy to deal with it growing back.  G
