a parade.  We watched it go by for a miute when some little mexican ladys grabbed us by the arms and suddenley we were in the parade!  We walked along for a few blocks when a little restaraunt above a shop caught our eye.  The sign said La Olla... live music inside.  It was the most amazing restraunt I have ever been in.  The service was supurb and the food was amazing!! The waiter asked what we were doing in Mexico and we told him we were here for a language imersion program.  He got very excited and spoke to us very slowly in spanish and then explained anything we didn't understand in English.  We then spoke back to him in spanish and he corrected any mistakes we made.  There was a cello player in the corner playing bach... the windows were all open and there was a delightfully cool breeze blowing in... It was a very surreal experience.  I had a drink that was a lime and mint juice!  (My mouth is watering just thinking about it!!)   After dinner we met back up with the group and went to a salsa club called Azucar.  It was alot of fun but HOT... SO HOT... I cannot tell you how amazingly hot it was.  We only stayed about an hor and then couldn't take anymore.  We caught a cab back to the hotel showered and crashed... Ok so it was so hot there that when I wokeup in the morning the clothes I had worn were still wet... The alarm went off at 8 and we trudged to breakfast... packed up and left at 9. The morning was spent exploring the ruins of Monte Alban.  Monte Alban was a religous center situated at the exact point where the 2 north american mountain ranges intersect.  It was HUGE! and beautiful! Our guide was great... such a character! I could have spent all day listening to his stories.  but our animadores kept us to our time schedule and hearded us back to our busses.  Our final stop in Oaxaca was at a workshop where they make this black pottery... the clay itself is black and once they fire it it is some of the most beautiful stuff I have ever seen.  We watched a demonstration on the pottery techniques used and then we bought pottery of our own.  Between the market and here I spent sooo much money this weekend!!  The last 5 hours on the bus were miserable.... I had worn my contacts all day and My eyes hurt... I went to take them off and my left one got stuck in my eye... it took like 20 minutes to get in seperated... I was tired and couldn't sleep... and I was very very cranky.... luckily they turned off the lights and put in a movie... we watched Freida and Daddy Day Care.  It was a strange combination of moves but hey it helped the time pass a little quicker.  We got back at midnight and my dorm never looked more like h
