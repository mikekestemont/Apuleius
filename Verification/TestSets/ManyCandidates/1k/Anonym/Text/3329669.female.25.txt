yrs now.. yeah.. !! I am thinking of starting to find another job, better prospect, workings conditions, more challenge,&nbsp;salary wise etc...   why ??&nbsp; I have been thinking about this for quite sometime.. but now, with my company not doing very well, management have sunk to zero level of attitude with workers.. competition from china, on manufaturing cost / labor cost, iskk.. yeahh sucks big time there.. it does give a kickstart that I needed...   I am doing&nbsp;IT at the moment, no major programming, more like coordinating between company & software house, for development,&nbsp;I deal with suppliers for IT peripheral....   switching career track ? kinda like a good idea, but feel a bit daunted by it... should I go for&nbsp;sales ? admin / secretarial job ??? haaa...... head ache.. head ache...   ada jawatan kosong tak ?? memana... hahha  &nbsp;
