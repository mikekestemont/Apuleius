It's not that I don't like System of a Down, It's just that they're lyrics doesn't make a single ounce of sense. I'm kinda over the teen-anger I'm 16 i hate my father syndrome. I'm a bit too old for that. But then again, the next level is the DINK (Double income no kids) catergories, who think theyre so cool because they hang out in swanky resturants and have swanky flats. It's always Swanky with them, Swanky Wanky Wankers.
Im busy doing everything BUT work so yeah. Slag off.  I'm feeling depressed, cause..... Yeah. I say again Slag off.
I love this stuff. I'm pursuing a career in it. It appears chocolate is more doped up than Kent last Friday night. After a quick perusal of the net. I found a few properties of chocolate.  It stimulates hormones that would usually be triggered by rubbishy hormones like Love & romance, and the twisted female intereptation of sex.  It also has magnsium and some other ions that ladies love, and require a shitload of (thanks to our friend Menstruation)  It also contains more drugs than bennett's bloodstream, most noteably; Anandamide. A toned down version of Weed. The protein in question binds to the same THC-Receptors. In other words. Chocolate is a very week version of pot.  its also got N-oleoylethanolamine and N-linoleoylethanolamine (triggers production of more Anandamine) caffeine, theobromine (related to caffeine) tyramine (An anti-depressant) &amp; phenylethylamine (I think thats a rip-off of adrenline)  Not that i have anything against Chocolate. But i do have something against dependancy on anything other than yourself. Just cause it's legal doens't mean its right. and visa versa
