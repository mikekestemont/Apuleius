ok yalls i need your prayer for somethin. I am not going to say what for but i desperately need your prayer about something. Isaiah knows and like 3 others and thats how it is staying. So just pray for me and ill let you know how everything turns out in as little detail as possible
wassup one and all....shoot, we need to post here more often....yeah....jason, dude, my computer crashed a few weeks back and i don't own pillar yet so i don't have any of their stuff anymore....i know ben and caleb do so you could prolly ask them tho...yeah...  ok, so, anyways, life is as always, interestingly awkward, and ashley and i had a good talk the other night...but yeah, i feel like such a failure sometimes...i take it harshly when i screw up, and i'm hard on my self like, come on now, i should have grown out of this crap forever ago but i still screw up...when will i get over it...  but heck, i've had stuff in the past that was nasty and i hated myself for it but it hasn't been able to touch me since i called on god to take it out of my life forever so i just need to keep trusting him to keep me under control and sanity. yeah.
Hey yall just remember To pray For Isaiah. so Yeah i think thats i
