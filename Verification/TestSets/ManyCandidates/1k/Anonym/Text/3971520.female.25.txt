all I am going great today. I am at my empty house right now and it is feeling a lot like home. Nothing compared to Momma's house, but home for me during the week. Thank you for all of your prayers because prayer has been hard for me this week. I love you all.
Ok, so yesterday was a hard day for me. I am getting better each minute of the day and hopefully, I will have no trouble sleeping in this big, empty house. Everything takes time and I realize that, but sometimes I have to let the frustration out. You know? You know????? Kellie, what movie is that from? I am glad that today has gone better for me. I did get off to a rocky start today, but that all changed after my mom left. I guess I was just feeling so much pressure from seeing her and knowing that she was leaving. My co-workers are all very supportive and my new buddy Keisha (8th grade coach) has made me her 'white' sister. We are already so close and she and the other coaches make me feel safe and loved. Darla (Coach Bull) and I are going shopping for teacher stuff tomorrow, so that will be fun. She went to Tarleton with Judy Moore. She is a wild one and those are the kind of people that I like to hang out with.  Thanks for all of the encouraging comments yesterday. They were much needed and it is nice to know that you guys are there for me. I love you ALL! Ho, thanks for coming to see me. I needed it more than you know. Until tomorrow...later.
Ok, so I am having a bad day and a really hard time adjusting to this new environment. You have probably read my posted comments on your webpages, so you have figured it out by now, I am sure. I laid down last night to go to sleep in my new big house after my mom told me that she would be going home today. I panicked. I am afraid of being here and getting lonely. You know I have a constant fear of being alone. It has followed me since I was a baby. I don't know why I have this fear. I laid there and cried and then finally broke down and got up and sat with my mom. We talked all about it, as she played with my hair and told me that it would all be ok and that soon I will feel better. She cried, too, and told me that she was scared, as well. She is so used to me going to her house everyday that it will be an adjustment for the both of us. These are just homesick feelings and they are normal. I know this, but I am still having a hard time. I need some friend love, so if you decide to come see me on the weekend, or something, I won't mind. I could use some company. I love you a
