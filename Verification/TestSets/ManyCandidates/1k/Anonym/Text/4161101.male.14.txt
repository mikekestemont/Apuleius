in secondary school it is better to study on your own.
What more can i say, tomorrow two test in a row. The teacher has indeed created a pile of mess for us to clear. I have to thank my maths teacher for been so "wonderful" and left us to do independent learning.Oh well, looks like we will have to buck up. For me, it seems that i will have to study everything all over again. I have almost forgotten the things that i have learnt after fooling around for so long. Hope im not too late to relearn very thing for the final year exam. Oh well, there are simply too many things for me to worry about.
National Day is meant to be a day of celebration and reflection. For me, it just another busy day to finish all my work. Oh well life like that. Worse of all, on Wednesday there are two tests. Too many things for me to worry about. The teachers are very clever. They fix the test on certain dates which for us find it quite difficult to cope and of course our marvellous teachers has done "very detailed" teaching in class, especially our maths teacher. Oh well looks like we have to depend on ourselves to study on our own.
Living the same life everyday would be very boring.Imagine doing the same thing over and over again. Actually for me, school days are boring as partically i do almost the same thing everyday. Now i am trying to add some colours to my school life, rather than doing the same things everyday. I start to take part in more activities in school. Through the process of those activities actually can develop ones character. Through those activities, (e.g. competition, course and CIP) i have learn that responsiblity is very important. Not only that, working as a team is another point. Actually going to school is not purely because of studying, its more about learning the ways of life and also to improve on our character. Although lessons can be very boring but then education is a part of our life. Treat school seriously and it will help in the future.
Last night was school annual parade. I was in supporting contingent marching. Lots of things screw up yesterday. It was quite embrassesing actually. Oh well is all over :p . The speeches made by the principal and the guest of honour was quite short :) unlike last year which was extremely long. Actually its an honour to be in annual parade and also to put up a good show, especially if one is receiving award. It will be good if i can go to guard of honour contingent, can wear the no. 1 uniform in parade. Oh well if i stay in SJI maybe i will get a chance to wear it then. The test for IP in NJC was very diificult. The English paper was very tough. Most of the vocab questions i cant do. Maybe this is a wake up call for me to start s
