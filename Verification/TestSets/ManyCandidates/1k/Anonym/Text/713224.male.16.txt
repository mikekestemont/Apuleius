going to choke i was laughing so hard. I give this movie:    ****  *
This was a great documentry, period. It was fun to watch and it amazed me again and again seeing all the different aspects of turntablism. It really made we want to go out and buy some turntables. Most of the video was really grainy, but the audio was fine, and thats what it was mostly about. I would recomend this movie to anyone... just anyone who has an hour and a half free. I give it:    *****
The Perfect Score is just another teen comedy/adventure movie. I still liked it, because it was entertaining, but very cliche. If this made it's way to VH1's movie formula show, it would get thoroughly pwned. It has a breakfast club brat pack of teams, and they all turn into a little bit of each other by the end (oops did i just give away what a  surprise  ending this had?) But in the end, these kind of movies are good if you have nothing else to watch, but this I think is worth going a little out of your way for, giving it:    ****  *
I finished watching the two season 1 DVDs I got from netflix, and they hilarious. Alot of "Sienfeld-like" moments, probably because Larry, the main writer, producer, and star of the show was the head creator of sienfeld. This is more of a middle-age suburban Sienfeld, which isn't quite as funny, but it makes for new plots, and more awkward situations. All inn all, this new version of sienfeld deserves:    ****  *
This movie was awesome! it had the two key elements of a good movie: Time traveling, zombie death, comedy, and the most important of the three, explosions. But seriously, this is an outrageous satire that begins where the Evil Dead movies left off. It is a must see with a ton of one liners, which, unfortunately, you had to see the movie to really get. It plays of every major cliche for the whole action genre (and some terror cliches too). This movie is too good for the normal ratings system, so it gets, like 14 stars. Just go out and see it now (make sure to watch itwith friends, because watching with a group of comrads makes it much funnier.    ************
"I would like to light that person on fire, but they are 15-20 feet away, far out of range of traditional lighters or even those really long matches made for fire places."   The answer to the age old problem is here, in the form of a badass homebrew flamethrower:   This thing is so hardcore, it makes Mr. T cry. It is a beuatiful thing when your neighbor makes his own high powered weapon, and tests it out right in your culdisack. But even better yet, he releases the plans on the internet, so the taliban will be running around like "JIHAD!!!" with a small army of PVC fire-chuckers. Doesn't that make you feel all warm inside?  check out  urlLink this forum post  for more pictures and d
