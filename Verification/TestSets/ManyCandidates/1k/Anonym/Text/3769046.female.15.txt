wish that you were mine   In the caf√© or sometimes on a crowded street  I've been near you, but you never noticed me  My cherie amour, won't you tell me how could you ignore  That behind that little smile I wore  How I wish that you were mine   La la la la la la, La la la la la la  La la la la la la, La la la la la la   Maybe someday, you'll see my face amoung the crowd  Maybe someday, I'll share your little distant cloud  Oh, cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore  You're the only girl my heart beats for  How I wish that you were mine   La la la la la la, La la la la la la  La la la la la la, La la la la la la.."
Pretty good movie. I enjoyed watching it. Little kid that was beside was hilarious. Saw enfers, "pssst"ed us. Blah. Sara went into stalking mode. But met up w/ three of them at the stairs then at the escalator. And someone else went into stalking mode, too. Seriously. She's obsessed. Like crazy stalkerish.   Wtf?!?!?! I don't understand this.. Are we friends or are we not? We act like friends.. Then again, I don't know. What does he want us to be? Seriously, I'm so confused.. Why must guys always tease me? I can never figure out things when they're chasing me or vice-versa. I'll watch very closely during the next beachness. Hopefully I'll be able to figure out something.
It was on the twenty-ninth. Hella fun. Attendees: moi. xtine. cass. mae. jamie. sara. monica. val. gezelle. clr. emily. lance. arcie. brian. jason. ig. eric. moby. stephen. lloyd. richard. gezelle's parents. Beginning was like sitting around talking. Walking on the beach. Was freakin' rocky. Woman was recording us. Freakiness. Then the "enf-ers" came. Pronounced: enphers. Huge ass water fight started. It was them against girls. Holy crap. That freak ass huge water balloon, lance got me first w/ that thing! Stupidness. Then more water fightness. Then it slowly trickled down to cass and I against enf. Holy crap. So out-numbered! 2:8?!?!? Wtf?!? And our weapons were like these tiny ass pails! And enf had water guns and water balloons. And after awhile, when enf were "refilling," cass and I stalked them, but they took so damn long. Then the second time we followed them, gezelle and sara came along. But then they left us, those ditchers! Hah, take that moby! Dogwater! Go cass! Haha. Oh my, what fun times. Sand castleness. Mine was so much better than gezelle's *rolls eyes* Burying-ness. "Awww"-ness. I bet she did like sitting there, can't deny it. My god. It's so obvious, seriously. Ice cream truckness. Climbing the jungle gym. Walkie talkieness. Sleepiness. He was a little too close to me. But whatever. Kits beachness was pretty fun and crazy, I enjoyed it..=). Next one = soon..woohoo!
