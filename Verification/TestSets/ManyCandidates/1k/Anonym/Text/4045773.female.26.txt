meant having shiny imported cars slow as they approached, or stop when&nbsp;the driver caught&nbsp;a&nbsp;glimpse of the dazzling site in the rear view mirror.&nbsp; (That'd be me and&nbsp;my photojournalist friend   Mimi  ; we typically dressed in&nbsp;combat pants, loose tanks and t's and sneakers. Sex&nbsp;appeal unlike anything&nbsp;else,&nbsp;no?)&nbsp;&nbsp;As though my friend and I would simply hop in,&nbsp;blow (job) his brains out&nbsp;and bid adieu.&nbsp; And our Turkish friends told us again and again that these car-slowing, tongue-dripping men knew we weren't prostitutes.&nbsp; Heh?!&nbsp; Guess the site of two women out and about during the day was too much to handle.&nbsp; But at least these guys in Central Park weren't in cars.&nbsp; And I was too distracted by the flickering  lime flare of fireflies  to bother delivering the Spanish lines I quickly rehearsed as I walked by.&nbsp;   "Si me tocas, te kill!"   (I couldn't remember the word in Spanish.)&nbsp;   "Tu eres un gran caballo!"  &nbsp; (Likewise the word for ass; would horse suffice?).&nbsp;&nbsp;Their tiny bodies--the fireflies, not the guys, who were not small--lit sparks in a quickly fading evening.&nbsp; I walked through clouds of pale fuzzy flies--what are they, exactly?--and was amused rather than wondering how many were now&nbsp;stuck in my&nbsp;hair.&nbsp; Couples lounged in the grass at Sheep's Meadow, pushed baby carriages besides late joggers who sang along to music in their heads.&nbsp; It was a perfect night, a far cry from the hustle of  5th Avenue  a few hours earlier as I pushed past  bleach blond teens  in ragged denim teenyskirts up to *here* clutching their lanky boyfriends' hands, staring across the street at GUCCI in big letters in a goldframed window I'd never in a million years be able to keep gleaming day after day even if it were my only occupation.&nbsp; Fifth Avenune--blah.  I prefer the fireflies .

robert04nyc writes...(his *photo* looked normal)...  "... i'm tall, have brown hair, fairly fit. i'm also very well endowed. it's not just a little bigger than average, it's much larger than average. i'm not saying it brag, but rather to get it out in open. some women like it, but most do not. i have had relationships where sex was an impossibility. i would rather get it out in the open before getting into a relationship as sex is very important.it's hard to describe exactly who i am looking for. i guess just a fun girl that lives in the city. honest, caring, hip, sexy."  And this, from a guy who wrote me an e-mail: "It would be an honor to get rejected by a girl as pretty as you." S
