then went back to our Hotel to find out that the air conditioning was always turned off after 6 CHEAP BASTARDS! and the streets were so noisey. and the rooms were very small. We saw everything that Rome had to offer the fountains like the Trevy Fountain and the other Obelisks and churches that were around the city. Since our family had read the book "Angels & Demons" which is a mystery book and it takes place in Rome so we had a "Angels and Demons" tour that we did ourselves. After our 3 days in Rome we went to Lucca, we went to Quico Terra (5 villages) and we hiked 4 of them which was quite enough and went back to out hotel we stayed in Lucca for 2 days. Then we went to Florence which is where my brother had been studying for the past 3 months. He led us to every big church sculpture garden, museum, painting, and piazza, forum anything you could think of we tried to try. We were in Florence for 4 days then took the train to Prague, The train to Vienna was 12 hours overnight train now the train is like sleeping in a damn submarine you get llike a 5' x 1' square of heaven all for yourself and you can't move for else you could fall. then we got to the train station in Vienna, and waited for an hour and took the train from Vienna to Prague and met our relatives at the station, the train ride was 5 hours. Inca was the women and her son Michael who was in his 30- 40's and was a very successful dubbing director, he took American movies and dubbed then into Czech. He had the coolest surround sound - Home Entertainment center ever! Adam Turned 21 on the 19th a day before Father's Day. we saw the oldest Synogogue in the World, yes it even beats out the ones in Israel. We enjoyed a good 4 days in Prague and it's sites and places then we came home. If you would like anymore information about my trip please set up an appointment or IM me.

I am having lots of fun at this day camp, yes I know what you are all thinking day camp is for babies, but it isn't. I finally met someone that shares interests and common knowledge as I do about things. So fun, fun, fun. Anyways the one thing that got to me is that people are busy all the time! Like not some of the time...All of the time! Just bugs me that when you ask someone what they are doing a couple weeks from the time you ask them, they don't make other plans, they work you in! So it is eating me alittle but no pain no game. I mean there are lots of people that I would love to hang out with but they just don't have the time for me! Anyway fun in the S
