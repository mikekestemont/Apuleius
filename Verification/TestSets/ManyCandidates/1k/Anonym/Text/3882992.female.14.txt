trustworthy people I described in the beginning.   Now I guess I just have to search for that "perfect place"
Emptyness  Just a little speck of dust, Lost inside a world of lust, So invisible you can't see, Love shatters when it's near me.  It never shows, Until the pain explodes. So much to live for, So much to die for.  Underneath it all, Is a heart that is so small Inside my soul, Is an unrepairable hole.
I never in my whole entire life really ever had a best friend. Nobody I was willing to open up to enough, and when I did, I always (without fail) got hurt.      I hate getting hurt because I always think that it's my fault. Maybe sometimes it is, but I put most of it on myself. I can't go through each day knowing that I hurt people or worse, that they hurt me. I hate the feeling of having nobody to really "belong" to out there. Not saying that I want to be loved that much, but I do really like to be considered as a good friend sometimes.       I never really actually tried to be somebody lovable. I'm not an easy person to love in the first place. I'm selfish and I am a real idiot most of the times. I have an ongoing pain for some reason most of the time too. Why can't I be a happy-go-lucky kind of person. I'd love to wake up one day and have some kind of meaning to my life. I hope that one day I'll finally wake up.   Wake up to some kind of light.   Some kind of shadow that will lead me to hope or faith or meaning.   I hope some day soon because I can't stand this nightmare.
I guess I might be a little over dramatic about soem aspects of my life. But things always go wrong for me I guess. I mean my best friend in the whole world, Ryan, won't talk to me anymore. We're not even friends because of my stupid phobia of loving him so much (as a friend) the he would die away with everything else. I am really afraid to love people because I'm afraid that they will leave me or hurt me or worst of all--I'll hurt them. I just wish I could have never made it happen. I really regret what I said and I totally wish that I could completely restart. I don't want to fight anymore.I miss him too. I hate seeing him and not be able to laugh and talk to him.I guess I fucked up big time this time.I hope that we do become friends again-but that won't probably happen for a logn time 'cause he's probably majorly pissed at me at the moment. I guess I'm going to have to deal with losing a really good friend. Even thoguh it hurts I hope that I can get through this one.But if I could wish for anything in the world--I wish that I never said anything because I fucked up something g
