that was typical of his brother's behavior- to blame anyone else for his mistakes.  So on the way home, I told my boyfriend that, while I didn't want to make an issue of it, I thought it was particularly shitty of his brother to say those things and for his mom to affirm them. Immediately, my boyfriend turned to face the window. I knew this was going to be a sore spot for him. So I said that I would never make up shit about either of them (fortunately, they provide enough real-life stories that I don't have to get creative), and I was kinda offended. I was going to leave it at that.  Well, my boyfriend launches into this whole defense of his family (which is understandable) and tells me that it's not a big deal. Then he went on to say that he wouldn't let things like that bother him. So I said, "Well, then I guess you're a better person than I am."  (Boyfriend shouting) "Yeah, actually I am better than you! Take me home!"  We drove the rest of the way home in complete silence, although I was absolutely seething with anger. How DARE he! I always knew he had this "holier than thou" attitude, but until that moment, he had always managed to aim it at everyone else. Needless to say, we never went on our picnic.  Bright and early Saturday morning, I met up with Her Highness in the kitchen. Without missing a beat, she launched into the whole "Oh, when we said you did that to the car, we were joking. Ha ha."  Yeah, ha ha.  So I told her that I really didn't understand how she could believe I had done all of that damage (because if shit hits the fan, I will NOT be responsible for any of it), especially when she was with him the last time he hit something. And I told her that I didn't appreciate having lies told about me to people I have professional relationships with.  "Oh, we all thought he knew it was a joke. We said that because we were embarrassed." (Lalalala in her fake, everyone loves me voice)  I got even more pissed at my boyfriend for blabbing about the whole thing to his mom. I didn't speak to him until Monday night, when he practically followed me around the house asking inane questions (wonder where he gets that from?). He apologized and said that he was only joking when he made that "better than you" comment.  Like the jerk that I am, I made him work for an apology.  (Him, being all sincere) "I don't actually think that I'm better than you. I didn't want you to think that I'm better than you."  (Me, in my emotionally unavailable way) "Oh, don't worry. I KNOW that you aren't better than me."  (Him) "I'm sorry I said that. I thought you'd know I was joking. I didn't mean it."  (Me) "Good."  Eh, situation resolved, I guess. This family needs to work on their joking s
