think I'd learn my lesson by now.   Andrea was out mowing the lawn and when she came in she said the Sumac trees were overhanging pretty far and it was hard to mow around the edge of the lawn. So I went out with my trusty chainsaw and cut down almost all of the trees, then dragged them to a burn pile. This took 3 days. They didn't burn, but I got infected from all the exposure. Been itching from head to toe for almost a week now. Next time I'm just using Round-Up.
Trying to figure out the best way to finish off an outside coal bin. Pad is already down (cement). Can't figure if I want it to be open up near the roof with a shed type roof, angled to the back; or typical gabel roof except trusses on left and right sides. Also trying to figure the height. One way for gabel is to have it 6 feet high. If doing shed roof, can have it shorter, like 4 feet, but not sure if I like it open like that. Maybe I'll just do the shed roof  cause it's easier  and make the walls taller to close it off. Can use plywood to finish off areas exposed around roof on sides, front and back. Have to get this whole thing done soon though, so we can order a few tons of coal before the winter!
I used to use webcams when they first came out, so I thought it would be cool to use one to monitor the cats when we go on our cruise. My plan is to either have software connect to an ftp site and upload images periodically, time stamped, or a network webcam with a self contained web server or ftp capability. If I'm going to entrust our five little friends to technology however, thorough testing should occur first! Found this webcam  urlLink software  for free. Didn't seem to connect to my ftp server, but I think it may have been the server. Some problems with the software too. Seemed a bit buggy. I'm running XP Pro and it my system started doing some strange things after running it for a few hours. It does have some nice features, but I'm not sure I want to trust it for the 5 days or so.  Perhaps the better idea would be to not use those old USB webcams I have, but new 802.11b wireless or robotic/motorized. Of course, that's a bit more of an expense. Still investigating, not sure which way to go. Suggestions?
Been setting up my nephew Tim's computer for the past couple days. Got all the parts sent to me so I could build it for him. It's a pretty kicken system with an Athlon 64 3200 processor, 1 gig ram, 160 gig serial HD, DVDRW - all in one cool lookin case. Hope to have it finished and all backed up for him as well by tomorrow. Actually that'd be today.  WOW  it's late! 1:30 A.M. now. I'll finish up later, I'm t
