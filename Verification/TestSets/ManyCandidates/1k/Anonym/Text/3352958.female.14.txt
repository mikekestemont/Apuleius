play and I'm good and that I'm not overwhelmed and whatnot. Other than that August will be a slightly less busy month. I have the Relay for Life and my g-parents 50th wedding anniversary this weekend but that is all I know of now. OH OH! AND I will probably go the the Twin's game this Thursday! I'm so excited that will definently make my month! Well I think that's all for now...talk later--kirsten
Just got back from our state tournament in Elk River a few hours ago. I have to say that I am a wee bit relieved to finally be through with softball. I am even pondering whether to play southern star next year. It just doesn't tweak my melon like school ball does. By the way 'tweak my melon' is my new phrase. I will now explain how we did. Our first game of the tournament was yesterday early in the morning. We lost to I don't remember what team they were but our team had TONS of errors so we didn't deserve to win it anyways. I didn't get much action in right field, but none-the-less I like outfield. Eventually it WILL become a more valuable position. We played two more teams that day and won both. So we ended up playing at eight in the morning today. We won our game. I had a really good hit with two outs and on an error by the other team when Ten. hit the ball I got from first to home and Ten. later got home. Those were some good insurance runs. We won our next game too. Our last game we didn't win, but I'm not really included in that we cuz I did not play at all! I don't know what I did wrong to not be able to play but whatever it's really not my problem I just felt stupid not playing at all. He had me pinch hit for J but I hit a grounder, and to be honest I didn't really want a hit, because I didn't wanna be the tying run when I had done nothing else. I didn't feel B deserved a win to be honest. I do not think I'm gonna do summer ball next year. If I did I want to be with the older girls like I was last year. They actually let me play and I had fun. We got fourth place to finish it off. Guess who was right about the Doug M. thing?  he's gone exactly how I said he would be. Oh well we'll ALL get over it. Oh back to the tournament thing everyone was drinking this Advocar stuff, well not everybody. To be honest it was all too funny for me. Considering everyone was taking it I didn't see much of an improvement over our usual playing, but hey maybe it works...? It was just funny to watch all that when water and gatorade tweaks my melon just fine! Well I am going to get going everyone I am getting kinda tired...love y
