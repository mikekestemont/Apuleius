the table.   9) After eating, the woman clears the table and does the dishes.   10) Everyone praises man and thanks him for his cooking efforts.   11) The man asks the woman how she enjoyed "her night off."  And, upon seeing her annoyed reaction, concludes that There's Just No Pleasing Some Women!
I've got a car, I've got a car yeah, I've got a car hey hey hey hey!  My little brother decided to go buy a BIG car [a Holden Commodore VS Acclaim series II], which he did on Satudrday. He had to sell his old car [Holden Nova 1990 sedan] whcih he did... to me! Ahhhhh! To me it's luxury! I'm so excited!!!! PZY [ urlLink my Mazda 323 ] will be sold cheaply as a paddock bomb, and the rego will transfer to the Nova which will adopt the name of PZY.
Hey all! Last week... mmmmmmm. It was NICE!!! James, Em and myself travelled to Mildura on Friday, spending Saturady and Sunday at his old place, in Walnut avenue. I discovered that Mildura has a Spotlight store, that they have a cool Salvos opshop, and that it is much warmer than Ballarat.  Sunday we decided to make our drive to Broken Hill. It only took 3 hours, so we drove an hour a go - first Em cus she wanted to drive over the boarder. Then it was my go, I hadn't driven James's car before.... ewh! A Ford Falcon (Auto) not pretty. But I like driving, so I drove. James did the trip into Broken Hill itself, we arived just on dusk, so couldn't see much.  We had our first of many BBQ's that night, and played a massive game of Warlords and Scumbags. I was the only person who upon becoming Chief Warlord retained my seat for another go. However being the lowest scumbag was fun too, b/c you get to facilitate the game... nice.  Em and I stayed in the "girl's house" unfortunatly our other room-mate snored - loudly!!! Not cool!!! The next day was James' and my 3 month Anniversary. Excitement!!! I had to write him a letter by candlelight - it was kinda fun *giggle*.  So the week passed with each day consisting roughly of, worship, lecture, morning tea, lecture, lunch, lecture, arvo tea, free time, tea, activity of some sort. It was great! I'll write more about what we learned next time. Suffice to say that it was all extremely challenging! It was an awesome experiance, and I met some "top blokes, and grouse sheilas". (Go Eric Banna!)  Unfortunatly James was quite sick towards the end of the week. Poor guy, he was trippin out all day!!!! So we drove back to Mildura on Friday night, dodging the kangas. Fun stuff that.  We vegged on Saturday and drove back to Ballarat - where it was freezing cold. In Mildura I was wearing a t-shirt.  I have still got tons of stuff to digest about what I learned and discovered that week, I'll share it when it makes more sense in my head!
