a wild reptillior
If anyone has been wondering where I've been, that's where! A friend (thank you, chikichicky!) suggested I check out the site, and I've been there ever since. I thought it was only a kiddie sort of game. Boy, was I wrong! As it turns out, it's  much  more than that.   For those who aren't "in the know"  urlLink Neopets  is a huge online community. The pets themselves are only a small part of it. The basis of Neopets seems to be in earning Neopoints, which function at the currency of the land. One of the easiest ways to start earning is by simply playing the games on the site. With over 140 of them there's something for everyone. For instance, I'm not always the most coordinated of people, so I do much better in the puzzle type of games.   Once you've gotten started with some points, the next move is up to you. You can choose to open your own shop by searching for bargains and reselling them. You can play the stock market, or open an account at the National Neopian bank and stockpile those points to buy something special for your pet.  If you're feeling competitive, you can train and outfit your pet for the Battledome. There are six different arenas where you can test your battle skills against some of the characters from around the site. Or, if you'd like, you can challenge another Neopian to a battle.  If you'd like to meet people who have interests that are similar to your own, you might consider joining a guild. I personally believe the one I belong to is the best so of course I want to give it a little bit of a plug, so here's our ad.  urlLink     { TFC }  We have a reliable and dedicated council plus tons of activities for our members!  - Active & Friendly Members - Newbie Packs - 1NP Auctions - Wishing Well - Avatar trades - Guild Mall - Weekly gifts - Useful links and tips/hints - Quick-loading layout & website - No donations required    urlLink       If this sounds like fun to you, why don't you check it out?
