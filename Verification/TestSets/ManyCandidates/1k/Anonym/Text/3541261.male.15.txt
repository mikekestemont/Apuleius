and Expensive Things.  ...  On the way to College Station I got a first-hand look at how most Rednecks live their lives. Among the many items I saw whiz by at 60 miles per hour, I noticed an extremely worthwhile purchase. Spraypainted in white on the windshield of the tattered school bus were the mystifying symbols: FOR SALE, 95.00.  I had a vision. A vision of an ultra-bus, customized to epic proportions. With a camouflage finish and hydraulic wheels, this mega transport would be the envy of the Hebron sports teams who are stuck in the uncomfortable school buses given to them for long trips. With surround sound, mini bar, and shag carpeting, this Uber Bus would be the biggest and most impressive investment in my lifetime. Of course, the thing probably had a family of raccoons nesting in its defunct engine compartment, and it would probably be cheaper to just buy a brand new Benz instead of spending every waking hour of the day on this potential Pimpmobile. No matter what kind of future this treasure trove of a find would have been, my Mom just kept on speeding by, and I awaited my unknown Windex-involved doom at College Station. I guess I'll keep looking for a different hundred-dollar school bus elsewhere; I'm hoping to find another one of those Fundamentalist Baptist Church buses like we saw on the ride back, because the Holy Water tank in the back of the bus would be a great potential hottub in the renovation...
Apparently I had to wake up at 10 in the morning today. The guys delivering the door for the media room are schedualed to arrive "sometime this day" and we needed someone to let them in. We've yet to teach Gladys to open the door, let alone to wear the little French maid's outfit, so the job was cast upon while my parents hid behind the excuses of hair salon appointments and "work." Had I known this would have been a battle of excuses, I would have thought of a good one at 3 earlier in the morning...  As I recall, Colter visited the house last Friday. We ate pizza, and played Halo and Battlefield Vietnam. Yeah, that's pretty much the entire summary of the entire day.  School starts the tweflth, and I still haven't finished Huston smith's  The Illustrated World's Religions  yet. If the long-drawn introduction that repeats the phrase "This book is/is not about..." disheartens your spirits, wait until you try stomaching both Hinduism and Buddhism one after the other. To be honest, I'm looking forward to the good old-fashioned ass kicking that's often associated with Islam and Christianity, instead of this senseless "peace of mind" drivel the other religions push on you.  Tomorrow I have to journey all the way down to College Station to help with Stephen's move to a new apartment. My usefulness is, yet again, limited to "accepting deliveries"; apparently, I've got to stay put at a single address, read the Text of Smith, and wait for some guys to ring the doorbell.   S
