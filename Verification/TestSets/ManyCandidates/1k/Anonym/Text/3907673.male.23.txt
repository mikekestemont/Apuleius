the money, i was the last to finish counting as got some problem . lets hope that tomolo would not have much problem again, lucky for me that there was no extra or less of cash.  Then today, i had food knowledge test, followed by POC, today we learnt two menu, one for tomolo and the other for tues, as monday is a public holiday so there wouldnt be any class.  Well, think that's all for nw. till then. Cheers Thomas
Quite a gd day yesterday for me, last day of training as a cashier at Carrefour, later would be opening my own counter, lets hope that everything would go smoothly for me, and also that my counter would not have extra or less money, if not wouldnt be worth working liao..  Yesterday, for POC, learnt hw to cooking stew chicken, mushroom soup, and glaze veg. Hope that later i would be able to cook a nice dish out, hehe. Then yesterday, only got two class for me, one is CATERING SCIENCE, the other was as i said, POC.  Well, even though it was quite a gd day, it was also abit of tiring, from a whole day of standing at the counter. Think that's all for nw, would write again when i come back.  Cheers Thomas
