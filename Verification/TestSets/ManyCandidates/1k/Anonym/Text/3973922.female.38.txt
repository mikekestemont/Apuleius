laughed, said it was fine; he must have thought I was so young (and I was).    Looking back at it, Harry's stories were one my first introductions to being a writer. On that front, my novel's coming along. For the moment, I've given up on the idea of having a routine, a structured time when I write. My clock got all turned around from insomnia and a natural tendency to stay up till dawn when I don't have to get up for work (and, admittedly, too much TV), and I could never make that 9:00 a.m. appointment I had with myself at my desk. I came to feel like if I didn't write in the morning, I wouldn't write at all that day. But now I just say screw it, I'll write whenever I happen to be awake, and I'll keep the TV on if I want to. It's been going okay; I'm at my desk five, six hours at a time. It's physically demanding. My legs get swollen and my colon acts up (too much information, I realize, but I think I know why Hemingway used to write standing up). But it's great. I'd still like to get some kind of routine going, but if I can't, as long as I'm writing most days, I'm happy.    Jon laughs at me, "You still on that first chapter?" It's true; I must have revised the thing fifteen times. I'm back to my original concept for the book (sort of). I'm back to five different narrators (only one in any given chapter), and it's in present tense, but I'm writing in third person (like Michael Cunningham's   The Hours  ). Now that I've figured out my format (I think), I have a lot of material that I can adapt. Still, it takes a long time to get a chapter to the point where I feel like it's "good enough." I was very depressed for a while; I felt good while I wrote, but then, when I went back and read the pages, I hated them. Now I realize that it just takes more work, writing and rewriting and rewriting again. For the first time, the other day, I looked at the pages and I thought,   Hey, maybe they're getting there  . That was two rewrites ago. Most of it's sentence level editing. Then maybe I add a paragraph here or there, change this dialogue or that, figure out how I want to present the dialogue (how does Michael Cunningham do it?). It's a slow process, but I think the work's getting better. I'll include an excerpt soon, I promise. Writing it's one thing, putting it out there's another. I'm sure when authors go back and read something they've published, they see things they'd like to change. So how do you know when something's finished? Anyway, speaking of finished, I guess I'll wrap things up for now. Jon's home with massive back pain. I think I just heard him collapse on the sofa.    P.S. -- Hats off to ya Harry.  Hope you're out there w
