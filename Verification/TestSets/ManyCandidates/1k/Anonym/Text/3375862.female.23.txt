homes for things. This will last until ten minutes after I start unpacking at the other end, I imagine.
A long silence, for no good reason other than logistics - i had no computer. Now I have a shiny new one, to go with my shiny new house, which finally is warming up and feeling like home.  We've been here nearly two months now - a difficult month or so at the beginning, with the Soulmate away working all the time and me all alone rattling round in this house with neither pictures on the walls nor rugs on the floor.  Funny how the lack of a safe place to go home makes life so much harder - I found it hard to cope with work, felt depressed... so we took a week off together and bought furniture and unpacked a bit. It has helped immensely. In fact I'd say we were better friends for it - this was a house full of tension and niggly people for a while.  Anyway just wanted to break the silence. It's like anything, the longer the break the bigger the build-up, and the better you feel your comeback should be... so I just decided to get on here and write this, straggly and unlovely though it may be, just to get going again. I shall go, now, and collect myself in order to write something more meaningful and intelligent next time. Wine may help with that, I think....
Snatching five minutes to write this. I am so jealous of my thinking-space... The worst thing about the nine-to-five is the lack of time to THINK... especially when what you do all day isn't what you think of as your 'real work'. I come home exhausted, no energy being pleasant company for the Soulmate, or for writing. I have a million ideas a day, but no time to use them, and then I get home and exhaustion has driven them all from my head. I really believe the quote from Leo Tolstoy which goes; 'The changes in our life must come from the impossibility to live otherwise than according to the demands of our conscience ... not from our mental resolution to try a new form of life.' Despite this, I think sometimes you have to put your foot down, to stop yourself being too lazy to make a change. Left to its own devices my lazier self would happily go on eating in front of the TV and staying slumped on the sofa watching American television until tiredness forces me up to bed. However, I have decided to find some discipline from somewhere, and change things. I'll get up for an hour or so of thought and reading before work, and only watch the television if there is something on which meets the standards I would set for a book or a film at the cinema. Today I have also dutifully drunk more water and had fruit for lunch... before being seduced by a chocolate cookie. Ah well, too much healthy living is bad for the p
