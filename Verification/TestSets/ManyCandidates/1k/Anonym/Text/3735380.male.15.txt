 My experience is at acting class today. There were about 85 students in all. Today is only the second day and I've already made about 15 new friends. Previously, though, I have been an internet addict for the whole summer. Is this a nice way to train your social brain, or is it just a coincidence?  In a poll asked  urlLink here (click)  the opinions are divided 2/3 to 1/3.  So what do you think?
Okay, since computers are a part of science, I think I'll launch this big baby off with some computer science. It's my main field and I'm actually quite interested in computers. Expect a lot of posts about computers.  As I was saying:  Let's go to the basics. A character is a letter, number, symbol, or a superspecial character. A spacebar is considered a character, a "U" is considered a character, and punctuation and this thingy: §. All of those things you can highlight.  Okay, let's get a little more advanced. Now you're wondering what a special character is. If you go to start > programs > accessories > Character Map, you'll see what I mean. Double click something to get it onto the screen, but since I have most of them memorized, I'll teach you something.  You know what the number pad is? It's the little group of keys that look like a calculator. You know, the buttons 0-9 that you thought were useless on the far right on your keyboard (unless you're using a laptop). We're using that in this demonstration.  Okay, what I want you to do is click the textbox below. Hold the [ALT] key and tap 0189, then let go of the [ALT] key. You should get something like "½".    Okay, now the final part is more complicated, since there is no way of testing this and there are no visual explanations here. These symbols do  not  appear on your character map. You can get them through extensive trial and error. You can get superspecial characters like &#9829 and &#9632 along with &#8362. You can find an entire site about this at http://shark.nickj.elixant.com/symbols.html. What you do is you insert them into a HTML editor and watch the sparks fly. My personal favorite is &#1645. Have fun with your newfound knowledge!
Okay, since my other blog was constipated with a mix of scientific blogs and my personal life, I decided to separate the two. Below are the best links that I have written so far. You might enjoy these links. The best one in my opinion is link #5. However feel free to look at them all!  http://ilovepi.blogspot.com/2004/07/51-ways-to-know-youre-addicted-to.html http://ilovepi.blogspot.com/2004/06/is-riaa-monopoly.html http://ilovepi.blogspot.com/2004/06/pi-finder.html http://ilovepi.blogspot.com/2004/06/invasion-of-may-fly.html http://ilovepi.blogspot.com/2004/06/spam-spasm.html http://ilovepi.blogspot.com/2004/06/prophecy.html http://ilovepi.blogspot.com/2004/06/photons-liability.html
Okay, here's a new scientific thing you might want to read. These will be designed to keep you up thinking all night. Another one of the great things of science is that the more you share your thoughts, the more you help benefit society.  For starters, some of you might know me as Relentless from Proboards, ILOVEPI from Chess-Live, or just plain Michael Carozzoni from real life.  Well, let the blogging b
