more trips back out on the water. So we just hung out on the shore with chairs and just kicked it or swam in the water. Me and ryder were kicking eachothers ass in the water by dunking eachother, so that was fun, except i get tired hella fast so i got owned more then i owned him. :-/. Oh well i still had a lot of fun. Most of the day was spent doing that. I also got some tan for a change!!! Well more like sunburns all over but it stil works.  When we got back to the campsite around 6:00, we all had dinner, me and ryder continued to read our books and i actually finished my book. It was an easy book to read all the way through but thats a new record for me. A 496 page book in 3 days. Not bad for me because i rarely read these days. Since me and ryder didnt get much sleep the past day because everyone was up talking, we decided to stay up until everyone was asleep. When 11:00 came around. George brought up an interesting topic that we talked about for like 3 hours. How the music of the early 60's - late 70's compared to the Metal music of the current age portrayed how people protested. We had many arguements about how social political everything was or wasnt, George was pro social political to everything we brought up which was funny as hell. It's great when everyone's stoned talking about politics. But you really had to be there, i cant really talk about what we talked about in the end. Around 12:00 everyone went to bed for the final night of the camping trip.  Sunday - I woke up around 6:00 to the sound of two people doing the nasty "I bet you can guess who *cough* GEORGE *cough*, but i went back to sleep and woke up around 9:00. Ryder woke up at 9:30 and Zoe woke up at like 10:45. When we were all up we packed up all of our tents, all the supplies and decided to go to the shore one last time before we headed back to portland. When it was time to go we hit the road! While we were on the road, the futon that was fastened onto the top of the roof came off on the freeway and it got pwned by a semitruck, so ryder and his dad were hella pissed because that was a good futon. In case you were wondering, George brought a futon for him and daniele to sleep on together.  We got back to portland at Georges apartment which he manages, and we unloaded everything from his boat into the apartment. Then he dropped me off at my house with all my stuff and we said good bye. I got inside to find out I HAVE DOOM 3!!!!!!! KICK ASS  The game kicks ass! Its so damn scary everywhere you go! But enough nerding, This nerd needs some sleep.  Chippy Fishing r
