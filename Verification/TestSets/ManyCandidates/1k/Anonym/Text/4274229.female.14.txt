NO WAY! well. i took out a piece of paper, and wrote "dear resident of this particular household: if you havent noticed, you've hung ur national flag the wrong way. plaese correct it. thankiews." if that was not enuff! i even drew a "correct' version of the flag below!! woah. is that cool or what? hahaha. well. if u think i'm nuts, go ahead! all i noe is, i've done a great deed! haha. SINAGPORE RAWK DA HOUSE!      love,krissy
