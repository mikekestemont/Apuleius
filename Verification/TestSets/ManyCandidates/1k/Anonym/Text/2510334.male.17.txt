except that is for Thursday when I will be stuck in a lovely History exam, I can't even say that everything will be fine after I finished my last exam (Monday) but no, I have to go back to school and start learning next years work, then due to a severe lack of funds I will be working all summer. As is usually the case I will go back to school after six weeks more worn out than when I left.  adults think they have it hard, and tell us off for moaning about over-work and tiredness, but i don't see many of them going to school five days a week and then working week-ends as well, in fact I know some people including myself that work weekday evenings just to earn enough money to have a life. As my mums says 'you are old enough now to fend for yourself'. If that is true why does she receive ÃÂ£50 in benefits from the government for me and get nearly ÃÂ£300 pounds in tax breaks for 'supporting a family' wIeI i don't even live with her??  well must dash off to work, on a week-day, wheI i should be revising, but instead need to earn money to wheI i don't turn into some kind of hermit and never chance to see the world outside school, home and work!

As for my dad, he moved toSpainn at thebeginningg of the year with his new girlfriend and they split up within 3 months.Thoughh he did decide to stick it outIi don't know how long he ill actually last.AlllIi do know is thatIi get a free holiday to sunnySpainn this august.

That's about me for the first blog andIi hopeIi can keep on up-dating you on me and my s
