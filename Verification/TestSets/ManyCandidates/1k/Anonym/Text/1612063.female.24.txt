Matt's shared vocal proclimation of "time is running out!!!" The song then went into "Apocalypse Please" (because I had it going in reverse order, remember) and it fit really perfectly with the world ending in the movie (cause Donnie was destroying the universe to save it) and the part when Matty Bells sings "it's the ennnnnnnnnnd... yaaaaaaaaaauwhoaaaaaa this is the ennnnnnnd of THA WORLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLD." Yeah, we were sort of stoned. But it works!!!  Then I went to see  urlLink Dogs Die In Hot Cars  and they were totally fucking great. I remember not liking them when I saw them in London last november but this time around, i guess they got tigheter, and made me dance and be happy and jolly. Andrea and Karen were spot on when comparing them to Dexy's Midnight Runners. Sadly, no overalls. But the singer looks like Josh Hartnett to me.   urlLink Pitty Sing  also played and whoooo! I don't even feel like it's fair for me to compare last night's show to the one I saw a bunch of months ago. They really fucking great live. The singer  reminds me of Matt from Muse a little in the way his vocals are totally over the top but at the same time totally fucking appropriately so. They showed off a bunch of new songs, but the one that i love the most, "Radio," really shined. Thankfully, the band refrained from kicking my ass off stage (due to a sour review i gave them months ago), so they could kick ass on stage.    The night's headliner,  urlLink Morning Theft , is another band to watch, but when you go watch them, bring ear plugs cause they bring their sound to 11. Musically, they're in the same vain (vein?) as Muse (apparently my favorite band to compare other bands to today), with dramatic and hard hitting guitar lines, and vocally Rob sounds a bit like Kurt Cobain. Little girls are gonna love him.
MIDNIGHT SHOW   America's favorite homegrown party band is going on tour again.  urlLink go here to find out if they're coming to your town  and when you can buy tickets.
... SO OUR COUNTRY CAN BE FREE   Lastnight a  urlLink bunch  of  urlLink Jews  got together to talk about controlling the media and started laughing about  urlLink this little jem . Sasha Baron Cohen is a motherfucking genius.  When I first heard Radiohead's acoustic version of "Creep" that's on the Trickster EP I cried. So I was overjoyed when Kavin Kavin sent  urlLink this .  Go to Rothko tonight if you can. Two bands that are totally awesome ( urlLink Morning Theft , and  urlLink Pitty Sing ) are playing with Dogs Die In Hot Cars.  urlLink Jenny Penny  is gorgeous and will be DJing.  Also, if you don't have tickets to Curiosa, hurry up and buy them. I think they're going for 2-for-1 now, and absolutely worth it. I shit you not when I say that Muse's set was beyond mind-blowing. Matt Bellamy is a genius.  And look. A baby hippo:
ANIMAL CRUELTY?   ... or totally a
