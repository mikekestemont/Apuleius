me outta the house anyway.  I got home, did some more nothing...........then we had speggitti for dinner, i love italian.  Then after dinner i went and picked up my truck, i finally have something to drive yay!.........and now i'm back home talkin to the best people in the world, favorate time of the day!
Last night was the most fun i've had in a while.  I went to the David Crowder, Mercy Me, and Micheal W. Smith concert with some friends........it was me, melinda, my big bro, shelly, alicia, craig, janna, and jakob.  The concert was awesome but if it was up to me they should have just kicked micheal w. smith out and let david crowder play more.  Today it was hard waking up in time for sunday school, seeing how i went to bed at 3, but i made it on time.  After church we finished the bible study on the book "Its Not About Me".....great book, better bible study, best teacher.  Sad that its over, i learned so much.  Then tonight i went back to church and there were a lot of people there, but not so many youth, so the usual, but that may change soon......after band camp that is.........well thats it for now. Have a great one!
Today was kinda boring.  I didnt do much of anything.  I found a truck but its in kinda ruff shape.  Then later on i went to the church to help re-arange our youth room.  I really feel good about what we did, i cant wait to see the results of it.  Over all not a complete waste of a day.  Could have been a lot better though!
I've been at the lake all weekend.  It was a lot of fun, but my family was slowly begining to drive me insane.  Mike came with us which was great cause without him there i would have commited suicide.  Got to know him a lot better on this trip, he's a pretty cool guy.  Missed everyone a lot, it got boring up there, and the lake was so crowded, it was ruff.  Fireworks were going off everywhere last night.......then the power went out, it was awesome, then you could really see the stars last night, and the moon was full too........wish i had melinda there.......lol. It was a great weekend, woulda been a lot better if it was less people though.
I really can not believe the summer is already over, it went so fast.  It just seems like the years just keep going by faster and faster.  Well today i had a lot of fun anyways, last day before school starts.  It started with the normal waking up and going to church in the morning..........then after that i went to eat with Melinda and her mom.  We went to Olive Garden, it was so good, then after we ate we went shopping..........i really hate shopping, but the company made up for it.  After that i came home and finished summer reading and then went back to church and then came home and thats about i
