If you want to go to places, start from where you are.     If you are poor, start with something cheap.     If you are uneducated, start with something relatively simple.     If you live in a poor environment, and poverty makes markets small, start with something small.     If you are unemployed, start using labour power, because any productive use of it is better than letting it lie idle.
