could just get up whenever my body said it was time.    well i hope all is well with everyone.  i'll see most of you at tabi and jordan's wedding in a month!  can't wait to see everyone all together again.
alright, so i've been in CT for 5 months now and i FINALLY met some guys to be friends with. this is right after this guy (one of the pastors for sanctuary) spoke at church and he reminds me SO MUCH of john nash that i almost started crying at church cause i missed john and all the other guys so much. so i went to a help day with sanctuary yesterday. we got to clean out this REALLY old and dirty basement. basically we swept up about a ton of dust, dirt, and coal dust and moved lots of old furniture into a dumpster.  then we went and had lunch and helped fix up this really old baptist (i think) church. we did landscaping and scraping paint and stuff. which was great cause the pastor said it would have taken them about 6 months to get all that work done without out us.  so it was great. but the point (besides it being great to help these people) is that cassi and i finally met some guys. we met this great guy danny who we just clicked with and he lives really close to both of us.  so we have a guy friend! we also met this guy chris who is nice but we didn't click as well with him. and then we kinda met this other guy johnel, but that is a story i am not allowed to really tell. all i will say is we met him at Outback -- you can speculate from there cause cassi will kill me if i post that story online.  but we are not exactly sure how that one will turn out - i will keep you posted.   so how is ohio? i have been missing it a lot and i just realized that things will probably never be the same for me in ohio again.  they might be, depending on how life goes, but as things are looking now i dont think things will be like they were - which is really sad cause i miss all of you so much!  i could have been happy living in columbus my whole life... but i guess God has different plans. it's funny how life changes so dramatically sometimes. and you think you can eventually go back to how things were (or at least close to it) but you really can't. it makes me really sad to think that i might never just be able to hang out with you guys (amanda and john, beka, asha, and EVERYONE) again like we used to.   well, i'll be in columbus on friday for tabi and jordan's wedding!!! so i will get to catch up with you all then. i love you guys so much and i miss you like crazy! hope to hear from you s
