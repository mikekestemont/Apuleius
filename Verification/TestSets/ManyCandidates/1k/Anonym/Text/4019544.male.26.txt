AAAARRRRGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     Cant' believe It!!!!!!!!!!! I forgot to prepare aircraft work summary for AAK AAN and AAQ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and the review meeting is today....at freekin' 1500hrs!!!!!!!!!!     But Linda is so kind enough to prepare those summary for me.....ini mesti kena belanja makan............       &nbsp;   Ijust prayed and hope so everything goes smoothly.       &nbsp;
*yaaaaaaaawwwnnnnnnnnn* yeah I am so darn sleepy. Let me see.....it's 0524hrs now. We are still kickin' in the hangar. The shift is almost done. Few more task cards and we are off back to the Airside. It has been 4 days since i worked regular shift. Kinda miss the 'real' working environment.   Things are well the whole night. No crap and 'non-sense' ....just work and tasks to be carried out. Did my first 24 hrs check just now. Ran over few tasks that needed to be checked and rechecked before the aircraft ready for departure.   Well, guess I have to get back to work, just finished this report and tasks for today. Can't wait to go back home. It rained and it's so cold here. Hope it's the same in KJ too......
Yeah...it's raining all right. Tonight, I'm in the hangar with these good men to worked on this aircaft. As for tonight, it's 9M-AAT. Work was done sommthly and switfly. By the time I realized it, it's already 0300hrs local time.   Nothing much for tonight, just finishing off my task cards and ICs to be compiled later in the morning. Goodness! I am so darn sleepy. Had only 2 hours of sleep in the afternoon. It's a struggle now just to keep on typing and to keep my eye lids open.   The quiet night doesn't help too...out from no where, the raining cloud covered KLIA and brought heavy rain. It rained so hard that we hve to shout at each other when we need to communicate. Talking about working in the hangar with zink roof..shucks!! Ahh...it's cold! and I am damp from the rain when i went to ease myself just now.   Looking back on what happened in the day, there's nothing much actually happened today. Just met up with few friends in church. Joel, Liza, Thomas and couple of people here and there. Then there's the part where I had to go and send the INTI student back....The long drive was fine, it's just that I was totally sleepy while driving. But thank God that I was aware of things surroundin me. After back from church..I rushed home, grab some siew pow, took shower and 'landed' on my bed. Just to get few hours of sleep.   Now that I am here in the hangar, with AAT's APU screaming behind where I sit, it's good to hear&nbsp;this&nbsp;machine does keep you awake. The sweet smell of kerosene and the constant swrilling and growling indeed help.  Hopefully that for tomorrow hangar check, it's gonna be the same as tonight. No rush, just everyone are doing their part in finishing all those tasks without [someone] ordering them to do things and stuff.   Gosh, I really need to go...maybe I'll grab a nap to refresh m
