Bournemouth one....but maybe more subtle than just the badge! I might pop to Weymouth on Friday to see if I can adapt something they have.  Saturday night sees the lads on a stag night in Bournemouth for one of the footy team. He is about as exciting as me though, so I doubt too many mad things will be happening! Might also be helping a female friend from work move house in the morning...  As you can see, my life isn't that great...but it is better than some I suppose! More waffle will follow!
As I said in the brief introduction above, I'm not sure if this is a good idea or a bad one! My name is Dave and I live in Dorset. I am 36 years old but look much younger! I am single at the moment but have someone that I 'see' occasionally. I work for Fitness First in Poole. They are a huge chain of health clubs and have clubs all over the world.  Before that, I worked for Tesco for over eight years. I made some nice friends there and even had my main three relationships with people that either worked there or shopped there!  My main interest is probably football, closely followed by music. My only real vice is buying CDs and I usually get 3/4 a month at least. I now have hundreds and hundreds around the flat! I support AFC Bournemouth and have done since I was their first ever official matchday mascot back in the early 70s! My two 'big clubs' are Liverpool and Glasgow Celtic. I recently realised a lifelong ambition by going to Parkhead to see the Mighty Hoops play. Apart from that, I also enjoy films, eating out and a nice night out at a quiet pub!  I also run a Sunday League team; Blandford HMR FC.  We have been going for three years now and have just gained promotion to Division One of the Dorset Sunday League. Yay me!  I live in the centre of town, in a two bedroom groundfloor flat, that I bought with my ex-fiancee. Best thing she ever did for me! It's just me and my cat Mini now though.   I drive a new Mini Cooper and it's a great car....always been a dream to buy a brand new car and I was able to last year. Might be the only time I ever do it!  Anyway...that is the introduction. I hope to write loads more...it might only ever be read by me though I guess! If anyone does ever come along though, I would love feedback. I have a few big events happening this year: my brothers wedding [ I am Best Man ]; his stag weekend in Blackpool; my appearance at the Home of Football, the Theatre Of Dreams, Dean Court aka the Fitness First Stadium...home of AFC Bournemouth, in a Fitness First challenge match; trying to get a team together that is good enough for division one on a Sunday!   I hope that at least a few people keep in touch!  T
