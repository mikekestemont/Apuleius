Blue Note/Water, 1969  reissue   "Incredible work from pianist Duke Pearson -- a darkly-tinged album of grooves that surpasses all his other gems for Blue Note! The record showcases some great work from Bobby Hutcherson -- slid into the mix in a really sly way, so that his jazzy vibes color all the tunes with an edgey feeling that's missing from most of Duke's other albums. The group's slightly largeish -- with Jerry Dodgion on flute and alto, Sam Brown and Al Gafa on guitar, plus added Latin percussion on a number of tracks -- but although the larger group format often made for softer edges on other Pearson sessions from the time, the mix here is quite different -- at a level that works in complicated rhythms, rich colors and tones, and warm harmonics that have a slightly unsettling undercurrent. The album's worth it alone for the mighty title cut "The Phantom" -- but the whole thing's great, and other tracks include "Bunda Amerela", "Say You're Mine" and "Blues for Alvina"." - dustygroove.com  "Duke Pearson was nicknamed by an uncle who admired Duke Ellington's music. As a youth he studied piano and several brass instruments, but dental problems prevented his becoming a professional trumpeter. He worked as a pianist in Florida and Georgia (1954-59), then moved to New York, where he played most often with Pepper Adams and Donald Byrd (Byrd recorded his best- known compositions, "Jeannine" and "Cristo Redentor"). He also joined the Jazztet briefly (1960) and toured internationally as the accompanist to Nancy Wilson (1961).  From 1963 to 1970 Pearson worked as a producer for Blue Note records. During this period he formed a big band, initially led also by Byrd; as the Duke Pearson Band (1967-70), it rivaled the Thad Jones-Mel Lewis Orchestra, which also shared some of the same personnel. Its soloists included Adams, Frank Foster, Jerry Dodgion, Lew Tabackin, Randy Brecker, the trumpeter Joe Shepley, and Garnett Brown. The ensemble provided a forum for the performance of Pearson's lyrical, swing-oriented compositions. In 1971 Pearson taught at Clark College, and the following year re-formed his band with virtually the same musicians as before. He toured with Carmen McRae and Joe Williams from 1972 to 1973; in the late 1970s his ability to play was impaired by the onset of multiple sclerosis." -BARRY KERNFELD,The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz          urlLink  h
