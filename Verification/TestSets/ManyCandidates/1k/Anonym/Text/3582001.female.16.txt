over and spent 2 nights. We swam and jumped on the trampoline, and listened to music, and painted our toe-nails (haha), and many other things. Plus! Wednesday, we went to a movie, Spiderman 2, with Hooch and Jents. It was great fun. But Clarissa keeps telling me how she regrets not making-out with Hoochie. Haha. I love you dear. Jents is really RAD! And he smells so good! Axe Body-Spray is the best! OH BOY, yeah! MJ! Haha, her name is Mary Jane! Hehehe, don't ask. Where's YOUR fancy stuff? Woo! Good stuff! Well, I gots-ta go. See ya!
Get a load of me, get a load of you. Walkin' down the street, and I hardly know you. It's just like we were meant to be.  Holding hands with you when we're out at night Got a girlfriend, you say it isn't right. And I've got someone waiting too.  What if this is just the beginning. We're already wet, and we're gonna go swimming.  Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you? Why can't I speak whenever I talk about you? It's inevitable, it's a fact that we're gonna get down to it. So tell me... Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you?  Isn't this the best part of breakin' up? Finding someone else you can't get enough of... Someone who wants to be with you too.  It's an itch we know we are gonna scratch. Gonna take a while for this egg to hatch. But wouldn't it be beautiful?  Here we go, we're at the beginning. We haven't fucked yet, but my heads spinning.  Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you? Why can't I speak whenever I talk about you? It's inevitable, it's a fact that we're gonna get down to it. So tell me... Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you?  High enough for you to make me wonder Where it's goin'... High enough for you to pull me under. Somethin's growin' out of this that we can control. Baby I am dyin'.  Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you? Why can't I speak whenever I talk about you?  Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you? Why can't I speak whenever I talk about you? It's inevitable, it's a fact that we're gonna get down to it. So tell me... Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you?   Why Can't I - Liz Phair     Okay, that's how I felt. Now I'm over it.
