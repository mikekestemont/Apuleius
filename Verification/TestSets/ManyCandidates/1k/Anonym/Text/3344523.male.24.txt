big part of my plan changed on me.  Yep.  Yael.  And the best part is that she doesnt even know it!  Maybe I should have learned this lesson already.  Dont make anyone apart of your plan.    *sigh*  And now the boss is yelling at me.  Great.  Just great.  Maybe the weather will stay nice today so I can ride later.  That soothes me.  And now stupid Pirscilla is sending text messages to my phone.  Almost as if nothing happened the other day.  Fuck that!  I am not getting tangled up in that shit.  Fucking Leo.  I wonder if my face is going to be scared.  I keep forgeting that I am bruised up pretty good.  People give me wierd looks.  I guess it does look like I was in a fight or something.  At least it is already Wednesday.  Just two more days.  I can make it.  Two more days then I can sleep.  Mmmmmm sleep.  I think I will get my ass back in school.  Yep.
Damn I feel disoriented.  I feel like I may have lost what I was living for.  And I was sooo careful with her.  Sooo patient.  Soooo honest.  Dont go telling anyone this, but I did a lot for her.  When shit would get me down, my thoughts of her would pick me right back up.  I felt like I could make it thru whatever because I knew that someday we will be together.  But now it seems like we are getting further apart from each other.  I asked her why she did not want to be with me (bf/gf)   And here is the list she came up with: 1. Distance (duh) 2. Not ready          needs to get settled          needs transportation          not sure about me anymore                   has doubts                   trust issues                   insecurity  about the way I feel about her (i think)  And that sucks.  That fucking sucks!  It is all my fault.  But it is not the end of the world.  But is it the end of our world?  Is our comfy apartment where we watch southpark gone?  I don't know.  But I do know where I stand.  I love her.  And that stung me, but I smiled.  I smiled because maybe she wasn't happy with me, and she is breaking away to be happy.  And that is why I smile.  Because now she will be happier.  Even if it is without me.  As long as she is happy.  I tried.  I really tried my bestest with her.  And I can accept that I made mistakes.  Some which cannot be mended.  But here is where the irony of my life strikes: I dont think pirscilla wants to talk to me anymore.  She said I kept talking about Yael!  And that she knows that I love Yael and that she cant compete with that.    What could I say?  It is true.  I dont see Pirscilla as a romantic interest.  A friend, yes.  More? nope.  I know exactly how I feel.  And it may not matter anymore.  But shit life isn't all smiles and giggles.  I need a h
