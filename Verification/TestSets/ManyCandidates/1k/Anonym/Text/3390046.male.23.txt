a few minutes. Next thing I know there are a bunch of people standing around me. The paramedics get there shortly and they ask me all kinds of questions. "What's your name?" "Do you know where you are?" Blah, blah, blah. At this point I feel OK but they insist on taking me to the ER.  I'm in the ER (which I hate by the way) and the doctor checks me out. At this point I feel fine, but the doctor insists I may have suffered a mild concussion. So I go home after about 2 hours. At this point it's about 1am. The doctor tells me not to go to sleep and that I have to come back the next day.  So flash back to the present day, I am exhausted from lack of sleep and looking like a moron with all my bandages. Somebody shoot me! The worst part about it, is now I have to explain the story 100 times today because it's only obvious something happened when you look at me. Oh well! Gotta go, talk to everyone later. Hopefully a blimp doesn't hit me when I try to go home later today. "It kills over 1 Americans a year!"
I'm sure you all have been asking yourselves that question, and I'm sure that you have tossed and turned at night not knowing what my whereabouts were. Well, for the past week I have been in Pennsylvania. Scranton, Pennsylvania to be exact. I had to travel to Scranton on "business." I say "business" because how much work did I really do? Unless of course you classify "business" as drinking heavily in dive bars, then I have told you nothing but the truth.      There are couple things that I learned from this whole experience... First of all, I am a city boy. Not only that, I am a California boy too. It's just so amazing the differences between Scranton and San Diego. Granted, San Diego isn't exactly what you may call a "big city" if you compare it to New York or Los Angeles. But hell, it sure is compared to Scranton. I have never seen so much green in one place my whole fuckin' life! They say that Scranton is so backwards compared to San Diego.      This leads me to my number 2 discovery... I am not white! Don't think that I'm stupid. This was a fact that I was always aware of my whole life. But being in Scranton sure did beat that point into the ground. Good God did I stick out like a sore thumb. I felt like a movie star with so many people staring at me. So I did what any normal person would do... I told everyone that I was that Asian dude in American Pie. MILF! MILF! MILF!      I am pretty tired right now from the time difference and now I am about to go to the airport to fly back home. So I will talk to everyone later. Like I said, you all can breathe easy now... Ren has r
