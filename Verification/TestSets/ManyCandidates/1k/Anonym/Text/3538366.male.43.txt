found it an interesting retrospective on his distinguished career in public service.  It's all too ironic that Wilson was in Baghdad when Iraq invaded Kuwait.  His actions on behalf of our country in the days and months before the first Gulf war earned him the gratitude and praise of President George H.W. Bush.  That Junior and his thugs would do a hatchet job on this man and his wife only shows how pathetic they really are.  But on to the subject line of this post.  How is it that Bob Novak is still employed as a "journalist?"  How can CNN keep this guy on the payroll and maintain any credibility whatsoever?  Shouldn't he be issued a subpoena to testify on this matter, and if he refuses, be held in contempt of court?  Faced with the prospect of an unpaid vacation at the Graybar Hotel, I wonder how long his "principles" will hold up.  I'm guessing about 5 seconds, and that's being generous.  As the investigation on this matter heats up, we can only hope that when the dust settles, Novak will get what he has coming to him.
Hi, and welcome to the Frisbee Dog!  Let me start by saying that I know absolutely nothing about blogging.  The namesake of this blog, my 7-year old Australian Shepherd, probably knows more about blogs than I do.  What I do know is that between the two of us, we've got a lot of things kicking around in our heads, and we were looking for a forum to express those thoughts.  In today's surreal world, we get a daily dose of outrage, insult, goofiness, stupidity, you name it, from the Bush administration, and his right-wing hatchet men (and women).  Let this blog be a place to connect the dots and vent from time to time.  Hope you enjoy it.  It's a toss-up as to who is the biggest jerk in the long parade of right-wing hacks in the media.  Rush Limbaugh has been the king for so long, but there are some real up-and-comers out there.  From what I've seen, I'd have to say that Sean Hannity is probably the hardest-working hack these days.  Like a little flap of skin hanging from the room of your mouth after you've eaten a really hot slice of pizza that you can't quit flicking with your tongue even though it hurts, I tune in to "Hannity and Colmes" from time to time.  I must say that it's been refreshing lately that Colmes has managed to grow at least one testicle, but it's still slanted hard right, don't kid yourself.  The thing I hate the most about Sean Hannity (and there are so many things to hate) is the way he sits there with his head tilted to the side while his guests are speaking.  For a guy that is so totally full of crap, he sits there with a smirk on his face and his cinder block of a head tilted to one side like a dog listening to an antique record player.  And that just bugs m
