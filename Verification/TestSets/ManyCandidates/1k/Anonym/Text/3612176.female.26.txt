an hour to get our new Direcway dish to find the satellite. I sure hope it's not this painful everytime. We should be in Alburquerque tomorrow night. Looking forward to that! Gotta get me some Garduno's!  Cool dog pics - Jon says they look like dachsunds with their legs cut off in the pic! Hope everyone enjoyed the pig cake. Wish I was there for a bite!

Hellooooooo Dink Dawg  Just got the Blogger email & signed up. My "name" is arizonacolbys - in case you had any doubts. :)  I just tried to send you out a pic of the Piggy cake I made for Kara tonight. I think it came out pretty cute & Colby & Arizona seem to like it. Hopefully everyone enjoys it tomorrow, I know I will. Still not sure what we're doing tomorrow evening - we've got Kara's birthday to celebrate before she disappears for the evening, the Strawberry Festival is this weekend & Craig wanted to see the Reds vs the Indians tomorrow night at 7. Not sure we can get it all done & I'm sure the weather will play a role in our final decision. Well, I better go - some cupcakes are calling my name - have fun on the road again tomorrow - I'll talk to you soon!  Love, Em :)   posted by arizonacolbys @ 7:15 PM
Here it is - our very own Blog! Please come here often to share your news and check up on ours. We are starting a new venture in our life at the end of this year, and thought a Blog might be a good place to track our journey, sometimes look back at the past, and occasionally ponder our future.

Doggie Day at the Ballpark in Eastlake turned out quite a few doggies and their humans today. It was quite a site to see so many dogs in a place where dogs aren't usually allowed. Craig, Colby, Arizona & I even made the jumbo tron in between innings. They're such good looking dogs, the camera couldn't help but zoom in on their furry mugs. The 1st 500 dogs received a great doggie gift bag complete with: a collar, leash, Frisbee, Beggin' Strips, Canine Carry Outs, Milkbones, and various other assorted treats. As you can see - we got the family photo done pre-game with our favorite mascot, Skipper. Craig &amp; I had a slice of pizza in the picnic pavilion before the game (Colby & Arizona were happy to finish off my crust.) All in all - it was one great day at the Ballpark. Colby &amp; Arizona were very well-behaved & can't wait to go back next s
