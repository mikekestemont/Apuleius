to stop u, I donno why,  But I had to,  coz it had been ages since, I had a chatted with me, & with HIM whom u call GOD,  So I resisted, refrained and restrained, But you took it to yr soul,  and here I am again Sitting idle in solitude, with burning desire and killing sensation in my heart,    coz today I deeply desire to talk to you, coz today I deeply desire to hold yr hands, coz today I deeply desire to smell the aroma of yr bosoms, coz today I deeply desire to taste the flovour of yr tounge, coz today I deeply desire to hug you so hard that it almost chokes yr breath, coz today I deeply desire to look into yr eyes and see my face smiling in it, coz today I deeply desire to hear the shrill of yr voice so loud that I donot hear anything else, coz today I deeply desire to touch yr hairs again, coz today I deeply desire to blow air on yr navel to make u shiver, coz today I deeply desire to hold yr weight over me, coz today I deeply desire to inhale the fragnance you exhale, coz today I deeply desire to walk with u so long that I never have desire u deeply again.    So folks how is it...

When I heard it, I was almost shocked, Who wrote this Dialogue to be spoken by our    Peter Parker aka Spiderman.     Spiderman is supposed to be a Superhero and superhero never say these kind of words. He is supoosed to be   "Man of Steel".    Even James Bond never shows that he "Bleeds". Why Spiderman ?  Is it just that he is more human, or is it something else the creator of the Spiderman wanna to convey.  Anyways think about it....   Why Spiderman being a Superhero said this ?    ...
