convinced that somebody had to run against Barack Obama."  "I must leave the land of my forefathers [i.e., Maryland] in order to defend the land of my spirit, of my conscience and my heart -- and I believe that that land is Illinois."   Uhh yeah, that makes sense. Not really congruent with his earlier statement that he was running despite " urlLink a strong personal resistance ". But yeah Mr. Keyes, whatever you say!
Fox News is officially my news station of choice. Why? Of course, their obvious conservative filtering and Republican spinning of the propaganda they consider news appeals to my desire to be lied to. Hah! Yeah Right! I actually do enjoy watching the O'Reiley Factor, but comparatively there are few hot women on his show. Yes, I said it. I love watching Fox news because it has the hottest newscasters in the world. Seriously check it out, they're babes.
I am honored to add my first post to this amzing blog full of insight and talent. I am also pleased to announce the beggining of a new dimension of blogging (if it works). I will bring to the table extensive knowledge of the American political system, my credentials surpassed only by my savvy. I have recently met with some of the key players in our government as well as prominent figures in the American political scene to discuss the status and ramifications of current policy and politics. Names such as Sen. Chuck Hagel, Terry McAuliffe (DNC chairman), Dennis Van Roekel (VP of the NEA), Ron Nessen (Ford's press secretary), Paul V. Kelly (Assistant Sec. of State), Rep. Darlene Hooley (Majority of us are in her district), and Gov. Ted Kulongowski. Yes, some I heard speak, others met personally, one I introduced to a group before a speech. So, while I have stories to tell about them, they aren't even the top sources from who I have gained political knowledge and expertise (though the most famous). Anyway, I am liberal- but I play devil's advocate very well, if only for the sake of argument. So with that, I feel I have much to add in the coming election year and beyond. I am called to report my opinions and ideas to this blog, not for my own ego, (though that laundry list of politicans was kinda egotistical) but rather because it is my duty. My duty to the blogging community, to ignorant Democrats and fire-breathing Republicans, and to America at large. Therefore, it is with great pleasure that I announce; this is Jack Arriaga "Reporting... for duty" (I also enjoy puns, sarcasm, and irony in my writing)
I think the black guy is going to win.
This is an official press release: This actually has never happened before, but we are going to invite Jimmy on to the blogging team after only a couple of comments.  I'm sorry to those of you who have waited your whole lives to write for Misunderestimated, but Jimmy has shown promise and he will bring his sarcastic-conservative-liberal views to the table.  May the blog be with y
