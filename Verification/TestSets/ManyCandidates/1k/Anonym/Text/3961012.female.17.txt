days and 5 nights is a VERY long time for me..(I want my mwamee!! Min, if ure reading this..i know what ure going to say..MANJA) sorryla i cant help it..      anyways..today..quite eventful day..i think. college was really hot today..something wrong with the stupid air conditioner. seriously...for the amount we pay them, i expect them to provide us students with better facilities..not aircon that bakes or freezes us at times. and yes, i had two practical exams today..chemistry and biology..chemistry was fine..bio was kinda fun...we got to make "sushi"..the experiment was regarding how salinity affects the rate of germination of seeds...so we rolled 6 green beans inside a damp kitchen towel to make a kitchen towel "stick", like making sushi..ha..      and physics, was as boring as usual..as boring as my blog, u can say..   that's all for now..i am currently suffering from writers block..and emotional distress...   bai bai
hi ppl...sorry for leaving this blog idle for so long...so let me see...what my "fans" out there have missed out...   "YAY!!" i actually scored full marks for bio ct..not bad..hehe..was kinda shocked..the weirdest thing was...the day before i sat for my bio ct, i dreamt that my classmate scored full marks..seriously..i dreamt that my bio teacher was giving out the papers..and she said, "Michelle, 55 out of 55 and Siah yi ching 90%.." weird? Anyways..ends up i got 70 out of 70 and michelle got a 65. heck I never said I am an accurate psychic. Wait...i think psychics are suppose to be accurate..nevermind...   so that's bout the most eventful thing of my previous week. oh yes..one more thing..i think i am beginning to master the art of swimming the butterfly stroke. just not the part where ur hands have to go fly up..      aiyah..today i had chemistry ct...not enough time..i think the invigilator cheated us..her watch must have been super fast or something..i should go sue her..hmmph..i hardly had time to finish my essay..and u know how scary it is when ur friends start discussing after exam about a question which u dont think uve read it in ur test paper ? well..it happened to me...at least  part of A question..i wonder how many marks i just managed to lose...      after exam, i rushed to the bus stop..well since yee no longer goes home the same time as me except for fridays..i have to learn the art of rushing to the bus and grab a seat..yeah i do miss her in that sense...heh..anyways..the bus..cacat seats..the one i sat reclined to the back unvoluntarily...I was just lying back trying to get some rest..the seat leant back slowly until it hit the person's knee sitting at the back of me. I looked at her..and she gave me that do-that-again...and-ur-deadmeat-stare. trust me..she practically wanted to roast me for dinner. enough of the tigger always wanting to roast me to make suckling pig..like the ones u get from chinese restaurants..now this..aih..i tell u.       anyways..i gtg now..i havent done any homework and my stomach's empty..   *grrrk grrk*   (seriously..my stomach just made that sound..i know..u didnt have to know)      a
