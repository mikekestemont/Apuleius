Hoy! Kamusta? Well, If you were wondering why I haven't updated for awhile... (or maybe not... I don't really know who goes to this) it's because I don't have anything to say! But, today I have something! Okay so I've been seeing the commercials for...   NAPOLEON DYNAMITE!!!  It comes out Friday...  anyone want to go see it with me?   Darwin.
hey! well, I made a livejournal... and that one kind of got boring. So, now I got a  Blogspot!  Or whatever these things are called. Yes  I was very bored...  hmmm so this one doesn't seem too complicated like the last one. But, none the less! I still need help on it! So, if someone wants to take that job, holler at me! I'll probably still do xanga though... I don't know. Leave me a comment!      D
