if he wasn’t.  Tomorrow we’re going to Ikea in Carson.  How pumped am I?  Quite. I should also learn what the state bird of California is so that I can learn to appreciate, love, embrace, and hunt it.  Well, maybe not hunt.  8.5.04 12:02 am, my apartment in the LBC 	Ikea is so sweet.  Dad and I spent the afternoon there.  When we got back I spent the rest of the night putting together the stuff that I purchased.  I gotta say I really like what I got so far.  I say so far because we’re going back again tomorrow to indulge even further with a shelving unit.  I really like this desk… 	The funny thing about Ikea is the same funny thing about Las Vegas.  The whole place made me feel disoriented and totally off task.  I didn’t really know where I was supposed to be or what time it was.  I just knew that I was having a really good time.  And in the end I guess that’s what any good place should make you feel. 	I like living alone so far.  At least setting up to live alone.  All the decisions are mine.  No one else’s opinion matters about the way things look or how much they should cost.  It’s up to me and I like that.  I’m such an independent spirit.  Maybe not, but it doesn’t matter. 	We’ve been on this crazy journey for a week.  I probably shouldn’t call it a journey because it’s really a more of a destination.  Plus the word journey is used way too often in reality television, to the point that it makes me hate the word.   	The poor gnomes have been cooped up in my apartment while Dad and I took care of business setting up my apartment.  They still have dopey smiles on their faces though.  They’re such good sports.  I should take them to the beach soon as a reward for their excellent behavior.  8.6.04 (my birthday!!!) 7:08 pm,  1532 E. 2nd St, Apt #13 	Today is my birthday.  Because of the situation it’s a lot different from my past few birthdays.  Which is to say that there aren’t a ton of people and mass quantities of alcohol being consumed.  It’s been pretty low key.   Dad and I went to the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach.  We both figured if I didn’t go in these first two weeks I would never go.  It’s probably true.  It was a really nice aquarium, and I’m glad I got to go.  Way too many kids for my taste.  We ended up leaving when   This is Dan.  Kiah left his journal mid-sentence when Jon and I arrived.  I’ve never written in somebody else’s journal before.  Can I share my thoughts?  Seems like I should reserve those for my journal.  Happy Birthday Kiah.  We got sick of them.  Then we went to a nice seafood restaurant because that’s what I was in the mood for after viewing all those fish.  Jon and Dan are here.  Time to rip up Belmont S
