my poems i dedicate to my homie Ninja D:  You know you my homie, Cuz you're the only one that truly knows me.  You'll stick up for me at the drop of a hat, Cuz you know i forever got your back.  If anyone ever disrespects me, You're there when i need.  If i need you or you need me we're always there, Cuz for eachother we truly care.  In the words of Shaggz: "be down with me and i'll be down back!"
