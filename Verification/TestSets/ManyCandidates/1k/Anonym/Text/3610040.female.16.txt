Partying used to be the thing to do every weekend. I'd sit back and talk with my friends about how fucked up and wasted we were going to get that weekend. Drugs used to be the thing to do also. But I didnt totally get into drugs....thankfully. I look back and see how I would always complain about my dads habits with drinking and my big brothers habits with...basically fucking up. I hated it so much. I always thought "why couldnt they just stop, its so stupid." But then again..I was doing the same thing. I lied to my parents every night. I would fight with them too, all the time. I made stupid choices. And I lost friendships...I dont do it as much anymore. Party that is. I guess its probably because all of my party friends moved. Going to parties and getting "fucked up" just isnt really the thing I looked forward in doing every weekend anymore. It just got boring I guess. It's not "cool" anymore or whatever. Plus doing those things I hurt a lot of people. I'm not saying that I'm never going to go to another party again. I'm just saying that its no longer "the thing to do." Honestly, I dont know what I'm saying...leave a comment.  -later

I had to wait until 6pm for the next good band to play. Anti-Flag and Flogging Molly are the only bands I wanted to see other then the two I missed. So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I had a pretty shitty time and that was a total waste of money. I'll stick to local shows. It was cool that I got to hang out with some of my friends. I mostly hungout with Jacob. Which was cool because we got to catch up on old times. I also found out that he really liked Monica. Which is a good thing....but some dont think it is. I saw Johnny and Robert too. I gave Johnny my water. Which was a stupid thing to do because I got really thirsty. I got a Guttermouth shirt and a sunburn for a s
