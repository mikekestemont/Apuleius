and half hours. It was a boring place overall… Suelyn wanted so much to see her lover at Cha Xuan and so we decided to sing for the rest of the night! We moved outta Ant and walked along the road, making our ways to Cha Xuan. Scott and I were chatting a lot as we walked on. I think he is quite a nice person lah. Anyway, so long as my sis is happy can liao. I don’t really care… She changes boyfriend like changing g-strings!  &nbsp;  When we reached Cha Xuan it was 12.45 already and we had the room till 3am. They ordered a bottle of vodka and we had some vodka lime and screwdriver…. I don’t have to pay because it was my post birthday celebration! Sweet! I seriously hope that it was Gin instead of vodka…. SAD! I did not sing much as they were too noisy and I don’t like singing when people get too noisy. I went outta the room and speak with my darling on the phone instead… When the time strike 3 and I was the most eager to leave… SIANZ! Sis was too tired as she did not sleep well the previous night and as for Wendy, she was a little too high but not drunk. Suelyn went supper with those people working there.  &nbsp;  We got on the cab and decided to head home. On the way back, Wendy wanted to puke and asked me to pass her a plastic bag… She then winded down the window and started puking. The car was moving in a very fast speed and she is sitting right in front of me! I couldn’t help but to imagine her missing the bag and the strong wind blew all the puke on my face! I was telling her I felt threatened as I really don’t wanna suffer a second time the same old shit… She puked on me years back when we were still some stupid teenagers! Sis laughed at my remarks and went back to sleep soon after. Great!  &nbsp;  Home finally and called darling to tell him I am safe. He was so tired but still insisted of speaking with me… I knew he misses me a lot and so did I. I was very lost and tired because so many things happened. Well… all I can say is, what’s gone is gone… Things will never be the same again and I would want to love him like the way I do 6 years ago. Now, I only have eyes for my skinny, ugly piggy darling of mine! Hee!!  &nbsp;  So that’s all for today folks! I am going to watch&nbsp; channel 8 now and later got Steven Chow’s Tang Bo Hu Dian Qiu Xiang.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  Kisskiss! &nbsp;
Guys, pardon me for my change of blog address as I was so pissed and shocked to realise that there were more than just the three of you reading... So I decided to delete the old one and give this new one a better name. H
