that was starting to seem like some twisted reality when The principal Mr.Deerborn asked us where we were going and that he had been looking for us, so he took us back to class un-upset about this minor ordeal and we made are way back to class
Dearest Blog, Why is it that my Parents are such lier's? Maybe because my dad doesnt want me to play Soccer this year, Im sure if i said I wanted to play Golf he would be all over that!? His excuss was that My algebra grade was chronicly damaged? And my response to this "Then I guess I can sit in my room all summer?" and then my dad blows off steam with "Get yourself back here smartass!" And as for my mom? She makes to many promises, and is not so optimistic,at all!? Goodnight...
Dearest Blog, I am sycked that Soccer Season is almost Here!? Finaly i have a Hobbie? And an Outlet Besides the internet to Make new friends, People that I can get along with. But then again what if I'm being to Nieve? Hopefully not, because Soccer sign-ups are do this Sunday, My younger brother Bodin (Aquarious) is also joining the soccer team so at least I'll have someone to practice with? And in other news, well I'm trying not to avoid Sheila because shes done asked me to coney island and kings island, Both days I was busy and I'll be busy this summer, She had said that she Knew why I did what I did (wink wink) she said "because your jealous of Cameron?" I'm glad to say that I'm not but still, she was heading in the wrong direction with this one. And as for my work-out routine, Let's just say that I'm having trouble sticking to it, but I'm seeing results? And when I start Soccer my routine will be Twice worth the trouble, Double Fold! Goodnight...
Dearest Blog, Once again that chronicly tirening medication has slowed me down, Strattera. It was prescribed by my counselor Mary Gina (God bless her.) This drug is supposed to help me consentrate but the only thing it does for me is make me tired,irratable and have an impulsive desire to either fix,learn,obtain,or do things. It's obviusly working because i do have a moment of silence in my sub-consious to were i don't think about random things that don't matter, "good-thing" Ive also been in the chat-rooms and meeting people my own age, Last night i met Emily who is 15 and from Illinois (Lot of corn,I know) and we talk all last night, which was cool cause I have'nt been able to talk to Sheila since Forever, or at least since the last day of school. Another self emploid trait is that i've been watching Adult Swim late at night on cartoon network, Favorite shows are "Aqua teen Hunger force, Family Guy,and Futuram..." Screw that Anime crap, "way to confusing to watch or even try to understand" I also need someone in My life right now... that's all for right now G
