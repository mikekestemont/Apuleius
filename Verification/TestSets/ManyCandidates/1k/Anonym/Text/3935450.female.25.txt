6:00     ~Quick meeting with Qyweneth @ Allison     ~Mani & Pedi, maybe--no appt yet.     ~A lunch date with my Aunt Carmen          My day isn't going to be busy at all, Thank God!          We're making the plans for Courtney's Bachlorette Party in NYC, Can't wait.          This weekend is Tara & Michael's wedding.  Our dresses are super cute.  She's doing Pastel Colors, I'm in lavender.  I love my dress too!           The following weekend is Daddy's party.  He has no idea yet :)  Total Surprise          I've been dreaming of my wedding since I was 10!  Of course the color theme will be all different shades of Pink...from a Blush to a Mauve to a Coral.  Flowers will be white Roses with some diamonds in the bouquet. I want a summer wedding, on the beach...at Sunset, no shoes, and I want the waves to crash at our feet...You can say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one!           Highlight of the day: Seeing all my family! Love my family :)           T emailed me this: "amaya, you're my inspiration" How sweet is that?  This guy is a total cupcake.  So sweet.           Time to get into my jammies :)               Thanx for all the sweet IM's, Emails and Prayers, everybody!  God Bless you all!!!          ~*Amaya *~                    amaya, you're my inspiration
~ I'm super happy.  I just landed a huge deal with UPS :)   I don't have to work the entire month of August :)  KIDDING.  Sorta.       ~ I went shopping, got some cute skirts and I went nuts at Victoria's Secret too.    ~ Had lunch at Qudoba with Justin, Mark & Richard, I even bought....They were so easy to chill with.  So laid back.  Seems we all like the Yankees.  Good guys, can't wait to work with them!      ~I talked to Eric, he doesn't know who Jimmy Choo is!!!  Never heard of Manolo Blahnik either--what kind of man is this?  Sheesh.        ~I'm getting ready for the funereal now...it starts at 3:00.  Say a prayer for us.  We need all we can get :)         God Bless & God Keep
When you don't have to watch your family grieve.   Went to Church, had lunch @ Grandma's.  Then we all went to Kat's and spent a lot of the evening there.   Emma now says 'BATH' .  She's so smart.  I painted her nails again.  She's so adoreable.  I love her so much.  Tommorrow is the funereal and I don't know what to expect.  Funereals are great to begin with....   Sheesh...  K...on to finish some work, no work for me again until I say... However I have a huge meeting with UPS tommorrow...it's so mine already, but we shall see.   Goodnight :)
I woke up in a great mood.  I'm on my way out the door to Church :)   Thoughts for the day: "If somebody loves you, won't they always love you?"       Good luck to T....He's going to go see about a girl ;)        I think I'm going to change my outfit again.... I'm too sexy for my shirt..too sexy yeah!
