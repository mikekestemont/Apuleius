secrets filled with worry empty and hollow take a deep breath and swallow  no one knows which way does the wind blow? How many times have I been bleeding in vain? How many times have I cut myself to try to avoid the pain? I can't take these long days and somber nights I can't take how I don't even try to put up a fight my walls have been raised at the end of the day all I can be is me and I think that's ok. I don't like myself and neither do you but it sucks to live in a world full of so much and all you can think about is how you have been screwed it seems as if my whole world constantly comes unglued.

I can't run from myself and I certainly can't hide. I feel like the only choice that I have left is suicide. I can't abide by your rules, I've already played the fool. I'm not just a tool you can use whenever something needs fixing you have already beat me like a cheap rug and if i was on life support I have no doubt in my mind that you would pull the plug and then you'd throw my lifeless body in the hole I already dug.....mend my shattered soul I've completely lost control fix my bleeding heart your acid tongue has torn my world apart. Where did I start? I'm full of pure and undiluted hatred my whole life has been forsaken shaken stirred my eyes are blurred from my tears of blood you aren't the first to lose my trust, I'll hold my breath until I b
