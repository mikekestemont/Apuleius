sexist and homophobic.  "If they don't have the guts to come up here in front of you and say, 'I don't want to represent you, I want to represent those special interests, the unions, the trial lawyers ... if they don't have the guts, I call them girlie men," Schwarzenegger said to the cheering crowd at a mall food court in Ontario.  The governor lifted the term from a long-running "Saturday Night Live" skit in which two pompous, Schwarzenegger-worshipping weightlifters repeatedly use it to mock those who don't meet their standards of physical perfection.  Democrats said Schwarzenegger's remarks were insulting to women and gays and distracted from budget negotiations. State Sen. Sheila Kuehl said the governor had resorted to "blatant homophobia."   Fortunately, The Govinator isn't backing down for saying something un-PC.&nbsp; To the contrary, his folks are essentially saying "bring it on!"   At a rally Sunday in Stockton, the governor gave a speech almost identical to the one he delivered in Ontario but without the "girlie men" remark. Spokesman Rob Stutzman said the line was dropped because Schwarzenegger had already sent the message he wanted to send, not because he regretted his remarks.  "It's a forceful way of making the point to regular Californians that legislators are wimps when they let special interests push them around," Stutzman said. "If they complain too much about this, I guess they're making the governor's point."   Huh. &nbsp; Seriously, though, I think that's the proper way to handle this.&nbsp; It's not a constructive way of talking, but it shouldn't be  construed  as an apology-necessitating offense. Is Girly-man a synonym for Homosexual?&nbsp; If so, is it a derogatory one?&nbsp; I know a few girlie men, who are not gay.&nbsp; Several have girlfriends.&nbsp; Of course, I consider it derogatory, but because of its content -- becauseit is better for men to be masculine, my own (tentative)&nbsp;moral judgement --, not because of its connotation. If an issue is made of this, though, Schwarzenegger has an easy out, I think, and a witty one two. &nbsp;    Schwarzenegger apologizes to "girly-men" for comparing them to legislators.

Two journeyed in a lifeless desert land Remembering their safer greener past From which they’d glimpsed bright lights across the sand. They went to find these lights; each willed it so — True friends share compasses – but they diverged, Each thinking his the truest way to go. But many times their choice-twinned paths recrossed And each shared what he’d learnt since they’d met last. Both still saw lights, and neither one was lost. There were no farewell words, nor any greetings (Companionship was present but submerged – Their aim was shared between their place-shared meetings) For good things never have a pleasant end. And each is proud to call the other
