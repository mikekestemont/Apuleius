year" that most people create a mental image of some high-roller somewhere simply getting a $10,000 paycheck every two weeks.  The voters Kerry is after know that they'll never see a paycheck like that, and by God they want to punish those evil people who do.  After all, they're only making that kind of money because they've cheated someone else or because they have crooked lawyers.  They're not really working people like us, are they?  They just sit around all day polishing their Benz and sipping Chardonnay.  Those $200,000 a year types were just lucky.  After all, didn't Richard Gephardt say that they were the ones who "won life's lottery?"  And don't they call us the "less fortunate?" So, if you happen to be on the fence in this election, here's your question.  Do you want these small business owners to keep that money and spend it on business expansion, or do you want the government to take it and spend it on who-knows-what in some congressman's district to help him buy some votes? If there was any decent economic education in our pitiful government schools we wouldn't be discussing this right now.
Mr. Kerry in your speech and speech's that followed the DNC you make statements that we need affordable healthcare, strong environmental polices, a smarter war on terror, along with a lot of other claims. Now my question is that you have been a senator for many years. None of the things you have stated are "new ideas" for voting issues, but why have you never proposed any legislation in the past 20 years to solve these problems? Where is your healthcare bill, your environmental bill, your legislation to wage a smarter war. I would think it would be your duty as a senator to propose as much legislation that can help the war on terror, since it affects both republicans and democrats, but yet no legislation, just rhetoric that Bush is not doing a good job? Enlighten the American people, let us know what YOU are going to do.
Well, John Kerry has finally unveiled his plan, but the catch is that its a Secret. He has made claims he has cards he can play with heads of states that will allow us to move our troops out and get full international support. I am interested for a senator who wants what's best for the world, he sure hasn't proposed any legislation on this issue in the senate, but that's ok, we know he does truly have a plan, to bad we can't compare it to Bush's because its all hush hush.

Ok, last night Emily and I saw "The Village".  If you have not already seen it, don't.  Its god awful.  I wish I could get my 2 hours of my life back that I lost watching that horrid film.  The twist is predictable, and not very shocking.  I am not going to spoil the movie, but it was slow going and boring, I give it negative 5 s
