utter fucking piece of shit at that moment.  &nbsp; I finally got out of the car and walked over to the dog. I knelt down and started petting him. He was breathing but it was labored. I cried even harder. I know this sounds so damn corny but I told the dog I was so sorry. He was suffering so bad. There wasn't any blood, but well.. I don't think getting hit by a car feels good. Michael called the police to try and find out how to get this poor dog some help.  &nbsp; Michael finally located the house of the owner. The actual owner wasn't around, but the roommate was home. I apologized profusely. God how fucking horrible can one person really feel? I got a damn good idea last night.  &nbsp; I grabbed the blanket out of the car, we all wrapped up the lil dog in the blanket and walked to the house. The roommate person didn't want the police to come. Her brother works at the shelter and she was going to call him over asap. The house is right around the corner from mine. I gave her my phone number and info on where we live. I told her that if there was ANYTHING we could do to please let me know. She assured me that she would let me know.  &nbsp; ***********************************************  I am too scared to go over there to find out how the dog is doing. Or to see if he made it through the night. Michael is going after he gets off of work.  *************************************  &nbsp; [rant] WTF is with the cops? Do you know what they kept telling Michael? They kept saying "do you want to press charges?" "Is there any damage to your car?" and bullshit like that. HUH? I just hit a fucking dog! I most likely just killed a living being and you want me to not only live with THAT guilt, but compound it by going after the fucking owner of the dog? Don't they think I have cause enough fucking pain in the life of the dog owner already? I was physically ill at the way the cops kept pushing the issue. There ARE some people in this world who know what the hell compassion means. I don't care if I had major vehicular damage.. there is a life involved here and *I* am responsible for cause him and his family pain. If it was a child, would they ask if I wanted to press charges? No.. my ass would have gotten a ticket and my life would be in shambles behind a major lawsuit. [/rant]  &nbsp; I DO equate MY pets as being a member of my family. They are not disposable. I came home and cried even more. I find out in a little bit how the dog is doing. I don't know what I will do if I find out he didn't make it. I feel lower than shit. I am SO not looking for sympathy. I fucked up. I know i
