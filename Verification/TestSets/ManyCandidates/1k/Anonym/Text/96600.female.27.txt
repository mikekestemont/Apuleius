also went swimming Saturday to cool off. I didn't do anything today - first the cable guy came, and then I got called into work early - but if the pool's not filled with small children this evening, I might go in for a while.  Eating should improve now that I'm moved and can restock my shelves.
I've weighed myself this morning and have lost 2kgs so I'm happy. :) I did keep within my points though some days I didn't eat enough. Being on afternoon shift I'd sleep late and not have breakfast. Have a little lunch then have dinner and nothing else. I'll try to correct that this week. I'll have to think of a reward for myself next week if I lose about 500g as that will make it 5kg. I know what I'll do for when I lose 10kg - buy some Lush products. I love their bath ballistics and bubble bars. Just wish we had a shop in Dunedin!   I've been able to keep out of the snack box at work. To be honest, I haven't even been tempted yet. I had to buy dinner a couple of nights this week so I just bought Weight Watcher meal rather than buying from the cafeteria. I even had lemon meringue pie two nights - quite low in points for a dessert. I made popcorn for watching the rugby instead of buying potato chips. I have a popcorn maker so it was totally fat free. I think popcorn might end up being one of my 'safety' foods.  Kind of cheated for my walk, I counted it by walking from church into work. I was going to do it anyway, but it's still a walk. I'm aiming to go for a walk today. It's probably warmer outside that in at present.   Goals for this week are the same as last week: stick to points and go for at least one walk.
I'm starting over again.&nbsp; School is almost over.&nbsp; I'm a research paper and a business plan away from completion, so I think I can manage to add a little to my schedule. &nbsp; Also, I went ahead and joined weight watchers about a week ago.&nbsp; *sigh*&nbsp; It feels like failure, but I know it isn't.&nbsp; I'm getting used to eating less crap and more vegis, which is a good thing.&nbsp; Ralph tried to talk me into ice cream last night, but I resisted.&nbsp; (I swear that boy is nothing but trouble!&nbsp; *g*)&nbsp; &nbsp; Exercise: We took the dog for a walk last Wednesday.&nbsp; At noon.&nbsp; In Texas.&nbsp; I've never sweated so much in my life.&nbsp; We also went for a walk last night and I think we might add walking to our evenings a few times a week.&nbsp; We also got up this morning and went to the gym.&nbsp; I spent 30 agaonizing minutes on the elliptical, but feel pretty good so far today.&nbsp; Tonight is yoga, then home for a quick dinner by myself.&nbsp; Tomorrow is my weighing day, so I'll let you guys know how I do! &
