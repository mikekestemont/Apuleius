to just "overlook" it?  Much prayer will follow.  So...should I "drop" the anchor?
Well, I'm taking the plunge.  I am doing something I swore I would (or could) never do.  I started a blog. So...  Welcome to the wonderful world of my mind.  I'll give the obligatory "no one is ever going to read this but me...so why write it?  Why does it matter?"  And that could be true.  I may be typing in a vacuum only to be lost forever on the internet.  But I doubt it.    Some brave soul (like yourself) will venture into the far corners of my thoughts.  Trust me...it is a short journey.  I told one of my good friends that I was starting a blog and he couldn't have been less thrilled.  Well THAT motivated me.  But I am here anyway.   I want to thank my good friends Quile and Boone for inspiring me to do this.  You guys may never read it...but you inspire me anyway.    So until the next random thought...I bid you good weekend.
Well, my son, Kyle turned 6 on Friday.  Someday I will post on just how old that makes me feel.  In fact, I can feel the liver spots exploding on my hands as I type.  Anyway, leave it to some of the grandparents to overwhelm him with ways to celebrate his birthday.  My son, who again is now   6,   was give $85 to spend at Geoffrey's (The Toys R' Us Superstore).  What are these people trying to do to my son?  Fry his brain?  Give him an early heart attack?  How is a 6-year-old going to decide how to spend $85 in a large retail toy outlet?  I'll tell you how.  He'll do it painfully.  It will be agonizing.  I will carry stuff all over that store, put it back, and start all over again.  Did he want Power Ranger stuff or Ninja Turtles?  Oh wait...there's a guitar!  No, wait...I want an Xbox game.   We had been there an hour and a half when I called my wife and said "We're back at Square One!".  That's right.  Ninety minutes and he had selected... nothing .  Unbelievable.  Can you imagine him trying to select colleges?  How about what tie to wear with that suit?  Which wine do I serve with fish?  I say all this to say.  I love my son very much.  And he is exactly like me.  I have learned how hard it is to actually spend money.  I got $50 from my Mom for no reason last year.  I couldn't buy anything.  I'm ridiculous.  When I was in college, I spent money like it grew on trees.  Now, I'm frugal.  I can't believe it.  I now realize I passed a learned gene to my son.  Poor kid.  When we finaly selected his items (He meticulously spent $90.84), he was ecstatic, exhausted and brain dead.  But, Kyle looked at me and said, "I don't like spending money...it's too hard."  I just hope he remembers that.   Especially when I give his son an $185 gift card to Geoffreys in 2
