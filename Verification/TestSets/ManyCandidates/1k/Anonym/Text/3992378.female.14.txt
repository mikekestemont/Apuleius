me of a chess game--The black knight jumps up, takes a route, and slams down onto a block. The white queen glides over smoothly, leaves a blue trail, and lands on a purple spot. Green, yellow, brown, black, blue...the colors are so amazing, so soothing. I can even feel the swirling colors embracing me, telling me that everything will be all right. I glance over to my right, to check the alarm clock. My body twists and turns, but I fail miserably to find it. Instead, I become distracted by these wondrous colors that are all over the walls, carpet, posters, books, and everything. It is as if watching a TV without having the power to control.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The soft gentle spring breeze knocks at my window, and slips in without any permission.

And just like balloons, they seem to pop into little pieces, which fell on the ground and magically changed into little red ants. To my shock and fear, the ants begin crawling fast towards me. I scream even harder than I ever did in my whole entire life. My face is already dripping with blood from the birds; I can even taste it from licking a corner of my mouth. I stomp, squash, brush them away from my body, but yet nothing works. No matter what I do, they refuse to die and leave me alone in peace. My heart beats faster and my breaths become shorter and more desperate by the second.
