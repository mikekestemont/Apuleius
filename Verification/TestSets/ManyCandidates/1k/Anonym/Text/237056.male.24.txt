couple of hundred meg of music downloads every couple of days at the moment and not a single comment from anyone :)   Maybe I should go the route of the old mp3.com and drop cookies in people's browsers, get 'em to register and such like..  but I'd (of course) prefer to keep it open and just have visitors volunteer feedback...  must.  avoid.  temptation. to. be. web. nazi :)  anyway - how about a little incentive?  If you have come to visit and give me some feedback, I'll put you on a special majickal list of "cool people" who can have access to high quality streams of new stuff as it comes out, or (provided the postage isn't too much, or you're willing to pay it) I'll send you out a CD or t-shirt when they are released.  a few words for a few sounds..  fair 'nuff right?

So it seems the playlist thing has been working badly, if at all.  I played around with it a bit this morning while drinking my coffee and ironed out a few glitches.   ...not that I'm saying it will work now, but it (at least) is playing the whole playlist through now rather than stopping after the first track and waiting for you to press  advance (or whatever).  Turns out I wasn't sending the Content-Length MIME header.. if yer interested :)

At present it will take whatever audio is onscreen to be your playlist,  so you can basically choose all of a category, all by an artist or just  plain all.  I'd greatly appreciate it if people would have a go at it - it works on  this iMac, but I have no access to an IBM compatible to test it on.  please  urlLink Drop me a message  and let me know if it  works and if there are quirks, just don't be a jerk.  --pph
After a little bit of downtime,  urlLink Banksy's website  is back up in a new form. Some beautiful art in there..  and quotes like:   "I strongly recommend if you only ever read one book in your life...  you keep your f**king mouth shut"
Well - what an amusing co-inky-dink.. Pentaphobia's server ( urlLink Web Axis ) was down for a while and (obviously) pentaphobia was too. Turns out  urlLink Rachel's site  was down too.  There's some weird electronic mojo floating around at the moment..  I have to give kudos to them though, that's the first down time that it's happened and it was very brief - excellent job guys!  So yah, if you came to check things out, my apologies - but it's probably one of those "If a website falls over in the forest..." things.  Seems a bit silly for me to say this now, but if you're looking for hosting - I really recommend web-axis, they're cheap (always a good thing), reliable and fast.  And for the cgi oriented peoples out there, they keep things nice and up to d
