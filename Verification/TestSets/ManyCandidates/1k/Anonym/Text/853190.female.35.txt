and then I got better and had to do what real people do (WORK) and then I got sick a gain, and, well, it's an ongoing yo-yo. :)&nbsp; Oh well, the great thing about having my story out in the open is that I'll won't ever be a target for blackmail, cuz I'm an open BLOG!!!     &nbsp;   Anyway, I promised you the dirt, so I suppose I should get to it.&nbsp; Let's see, I was born a poor deprived coal miner's daughter...errr...nah, too cliche'.&nbsp; Truthfully, I was born, I lived, and I probably should have died, but God has had immense mercy on me, or else he has a really twisted sense of humor.&nbsp; Either way, I'm proud ot say that it is comforting to know that there is a better place waiting on the other side of this insanity that is known as my life.&nbsp; I couldn't survive this world without my faith.&nbsp; Strangely enough, there was a time, not too long ago, when my faith was shattered, and I became so, very, very lost...     &nbsp;   (next post- 1993- How it all began)
1994- The Void...          I thought that 1994 would be the beginning of a new time for me.
