are.Doyou think that you are where you are today due to divine help orblessing.?  If I read this statement there r three entities1) We2) Soul3) God  You mean to say - We can pray our Soul for the position in which we areand not god probably bcos therez no divine help.  If I say - Soul = God. One who cannot know or understand Soul they name it externally as God.  Perhaps it answers few of ur Questions?Now therez lot can be pondered if u try to find each of the entity.whoz Godwhat the SoulWho is that We or I? (Most Important one)  tata,Sunil.

It is really gr8 if one really understands and realises it but after understanding properly what they mean when they refer to I. I do not want to speak on this now so let me continue by analysing ur other statements.  Why is that we blame all mistakes and failures on ourselves andall goodness and greatness to God? I do not agree with this.My experience is - Goodness and Greatnesss One (I) never thinks of God rather attributes to himself. (Proabably may say it but doesn't really feel so).on other hand - Mistakes, Failures, Problems - We do feel - Why Me, Why did God Choose Me or u call - Why only my Fate like this. We do not attribute this to ourself.  OTHERS - Just pick any of points from Sridevs mail, my mail or otherwise and put ur points.

Its sad that one set of his followers worship him rather than understanding what he has to say. I am sure Siva Reddy sir would be happy if I learn VB rather than pray him each day.  Sunil/Phani/Anand/Phani Sundar/Keshav/Prakash, We can have this discussion in my blog, so that others are not disturbed. What do you say?  R
