pounds in the past 2-1/2 years and it's not becasue I'm eating more. Others say I look good with the added weight because I was too thin before. That's all I have to say about any of that...at least for now.
...here in St.Cloud. I got home from 3 nice days at the lake Saturday noon and have been lazy since. Today is catch-up day. I already have laundry done, the floors swept, washed and waxed. Still hafta dust and vacuum and I shold prolly clean the fish tank. The stores are having their first back-to-school sales of the season. It reminds me I need to get my books for my Fall classes yet plus any notebooks/folders etc. I may need. I met a nice girl online last night from Virginia Beach, VA. It was nice to have someone to talk to as I do get lonely for conversation at times. I sensed she wants more but I have negative feelings about online romances. Experienced a few myself. Anyone who wants to know more can ask.

Opportunities will come around that will never come around again. The clock is ticking. When I am laying on my deathbed, I hope the list of things I regret not doing is smaller than the list of regrets of the things I've done.

The way I see it, the greatest feeling in the world is the first time someone you really, really like discovers how you feel for them, the same time you discover that they really, really like you. And the neatest thing is, most people get to experience this feeling several times. The sad thing is, once you get married, you never(almost, usually) get to experience that feeling again. Another good excuse for me still being single.
...rubber tree I paid $8 bucks for 2 weeks ago is thriving! It was dirty and sickly looking thing when I bought it at Shop Ko. Prolly why they sold it so cheap. I brought it home, washed the fronds with milk, replanted it in a larger prettier pot, and it's sprouted 6 new fronds s
