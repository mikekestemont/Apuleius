gone "just like that" after.. 7 years of "friendship," but that's just the way the world spins, I guess. Doesn't mean I don't miss her, though.  There's the bell.. I'd better go.
chose a new layout for this thing, cuz i got bored.   i am so dead fucking tired.
"Final presentations start tomorrow." "But I haven't started my website yet!" "......"  Haha.   I've gotta remember to ask Katie about catchin' a ride with her on Thursday..

I hope they're not all sold out by now 0_o  I got paid today.. yayy, now I've got monies for BART, and I finally have a bike lock. ^^  I probly oughta go and do my work now ^^;
current music: The Jungle Book (movie) current mood: irritated, tired, hot, sick  &nbsp; To say the least I'm remotely irritated, its as if everyone expects me to be the "weird kid" on the block.. weird clothes, multi-colored hair, anti-social... during one of the few times I show the slightest interest in being "normal" and actually trying to hang out with friends, or looking for friends, it's suddenly everyone's business to burn me and put me back in place. What happened to freedom of expression? Since when are there "places" in society, and since when is everyone so hell-bent on shoving one person off the top of the slide so they end up falling on their ass and sitting at the bottom?  Society&nbsp;truely sickens me sometimes.
current music: prodigy - fire current mood: absolutely fuckin' nothin'  I'm back from Nevada. Wuppee. I'm going to the doctor's to have my heart checked tomorrow, or Tuesday. It's freaking out over the little things and I'm not even 20 years old yet. I either screwed up along the line somewhere or there's something malfunctioning already.  Rents decided I've got too much time on my hands (IE, I spend far too many hours sitting here and programming stuff for people, or random shit that I end up deleting days after I have spent half a month finishing it.. yes, I'm that bored), so they've decided to let me start up another hobby.. so I chose aquarium-keeping. Suprisingly, they agreed, and are even going to help me buy a 20 gal. tank as a starter, a  very  nice filter for it, and some gravel and decors., to get me started, I guess so they won't have to hear my tacking away at the computer for hours on end.. or they could just let me get a quieter keyboard, but that isn't quite the point.  Needless to say I'm rather excited, not jumping-up-and-down-joyful, but curious, and intrigued.. this should be fun.  Yeeeeup.. that's what's been happening in my little cupboard of the world. That, and I'm going to be working for a year so I can get money to attend college next year. I'm EXTREMELY excited about that. Woo.  That's all I guess, I need to go to bed s
