handle on my own.  One thing for sure is that Donny and I will get through this by hook or by crook.  I just need to have faith in the future.
I used to cry myself to sleep at night but that was all before he came I thought love had to hurt to turn out right but now he's here it's not the same, it's not the same  He fills me up, he gives me love more love than I've ever seen He's all I've got, he's all i've got in this world But he's all the man that I need  And in the morning when I kiss his eyes he takes me down and rocks me slow And in the evening when the moon is high he hold me close and won't let go, he won't let go  He fills me up, he gives me love more love than i've ever seen He's all I've got, he's all i've got in this world But he's all the man, all the man that I need
Over the past few months, Donny and I have spent all our time together, but last night he went home and I won't see him for two weeks.  Last night was hard, watching him go, knowing that he will be 150 miles away, and longing for him to stay with me.  Today I feel lonely, the girls are at school then away with their dad till this evening and I don't know what to do with myself, I feel a wee bit lost.  The only strength I get is that I know I am loved by Donny and the girls, and though we are apart, they live with me all the time in my heart.    Life is good just now, after the trauma of a marriage break up and all that went with it, Donny came just at the right time to shower me with love and devotion.  We have had our problems too, but there is nothing going to stand in the way of true love.  I love Donny so much and I can see a wonderful life ahead, only we have a few obstacles to get over first, like waiting to sell this flat and us having to live apart till then, which is getting harder all the time.  Moving to Montrose will be the best thing for all of us.  I know the kid's will miss friends and their dad will be in Glasgow, but contact will remain and they will have a much better life there, with Donny and I giving them the best we can.  I need to stay strong for Donny, he will only worry if I start to fall to bits without him, but he is my strength, my happiness, my everything, he protects me from all that hurts and loves me so perfectly.  I don't know what I did to deserve him, but it must have been good!    Off now to find something to do, might even go for a nap to pass the time.  Will blog again t
