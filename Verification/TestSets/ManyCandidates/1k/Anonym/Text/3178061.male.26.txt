what someone is. The next part of love is acceptance. Acceptance is what we are capable of because we understand something about the person we love. We are therefore capable of accepting things that we may not understand about them. Now, riding on the coat tails of acceptance is forgiveness. Why forgiveness? Because I don't care who you are, you will find aspects of your love that you can neither understand, nor accept, but, for love of that person, you will forgive those shortcomings. You will forgive because you understand what they can become, because you accept them for who they are and who they are trying to become. You will forgive them because you have honest love for them. Now, let us discuss a phrase that seems to confuse entirely too many people. Here it is: "I am in love with (insert name here)." Now, the key word in that phrase in not  love  it is not the name of the love, the most important word in that sentence is  with ! Why? Because the word  with  implies, virtual creates a duality of beings in love. Timmy can not in in the hot tub with Tina if Tina is not in the hot tub with Timmy. Likewise, Timmy's misguided affection for Tina is not love if it is not shared by Tina. You can not be in love with someone that is not in love with you. It is impossible. Love is a shared thing. If two people aren't involved, it ain't love. Sorry, but it isn't possible to share something with someone who doesn't share the same thing with you too. It isn't love, it is a sad devotion to a idea or an ideal version of the other person that doesn't exist. So, we can extrapolate from the discussion so far that Love in it's romantic sense is not a two way street, nor is it a bridge in spite of what those Judd chicks said in their song. It ain't a rope, a path, a connection, a cable, it can't tie, bind or hold in any way. Love is a mutual sacrifice. Too often it is like an old Sammy Hagar song lyric: "Well it's give and take and you just take and I can't take it you see." I am sure that everyone has been on one side or the other of this type of relationship. See, it's simple, like I said, love can't bee a connection, it's not a path or anything like that. Love has no material comparison, all attempts to compare love to a tangible thing will ring false. It is a binding of souls together, a melding. No fifty, fifty compromise. Love is giving one hundred percent of who and what you are, in exchange for one hundred percent of what your partner is. Any thing else in a relationship is deceitful. It is giving everything up for someone with no guarantee that they will do the same and finding out that they have. That's my opinion for what it's worth.  F
