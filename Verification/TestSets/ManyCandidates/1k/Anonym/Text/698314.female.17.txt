I updated this thing... hm...&nbsp; The basketball camp ended Friday.&nbsp; That was.. hm.. how can I put this, Hell.&nbsp; There were so many boys and they didn't listen it was all just nuts.&nbsp; I'm glad I got my wistle because I lost my voice.&nbsp; It was fun though because of the other people that worked it.&nbsp; I liked spending time there with Miss C too, even if she did get mad at me for "beating my kids".&nbsp; I didn't really beat them, it just seemed it was all my kids getting hurt.&nbsp; Oh well... Now I'm working the North Hanover summer rec camp.&nbsp; It's alright. It's def not as much fun as it has been in the past years.&nbsp; I miss Brooks there.&nbsp; And now that Tawny's not there it's boring.&nbsp; yes, Matts there but we don't really talk during camp, its weird.&nbsp; There's a new guy in charge with Mr. Strons and well I just dunno if I like him yet.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; We've already gone skating and today we're going golfing... we shall see.&nbsp; I've also been working.&nbsp; I'm begining to not really like kids that much.&nbsp; This is like perfect birth control.&nbsp; Yesterday after camp I met Mark, Andrea, (Andrea's sister) April, and Miss C at Tooties for icecream.&nbsp; That was fun.&nbsp; It always is a good time when we all get together.&nbsp; I'm gonna miss those guys.&nbsp; I'm not going to get into that though because it's another post all in itself.&nbsp; I saw the Notebook on Monday.&nbsp; It was really good.&nbsp; I didn't cry but everyone else did.&nbsp; We went to the 10:35 show because it was the only one I could make because of work.&nbsp; I didn't get home until 1:15.&nbsp; It was crazy, I was so tired for camp but it was worth it.&nbsp; I have to get going to camp now so......... later
haven't updated in a long time... I'm sry for that... so here I go....   High school for me is officially over. First 2 weeks of summer I basically did nothing.  Went to the beach twice that was it.  Then I started working.  I work at Lucille Roberts babysitting.  It's not bad.  I also started working a basketball camp for Coach Johnson.  That's interesting.  Last week was little girls (35 of them, not too bad- I had the youngest and I swear my team was special ed or something... it was horrible) Now this week is boys.  (80 of them! it's nuts- I have the lil ones again... it's ok... we'll see how this goes) that runs 8:30-3 so then I go home have a little break and go right to work monday-thursday. Just got back last night from orientation.  That was a lot of fun.  Met some really cool people. I'm ready to go!! Mom and I also drove around and saw a lot of the area... that was cool.  Also got my official schedule.  :-) I have Friday's off- oh yes, be jealous... be very jealous... other than that nothing's going on... IM me if you want to talk..... l
