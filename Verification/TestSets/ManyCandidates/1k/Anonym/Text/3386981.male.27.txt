to actually saying it. I am sure; that had I said what I had wanted to, when I wanted to, things would have been totally different. I would be lying somewhere, oblivious of this pain, oblivious of the world’s sorrows and stuff, lying somewhere in my total decapitated solitude. My head separated from my body, would still be dreaming and talking though. But that is just a vision I have, I don’t think it is going to materialize. I really hope it doesn’t.  Evil dead is a movie I have seen many times. The scene where the girl sits in the window, telling cards true to the last color wrapped in her little blanket fresh from being raped by a tree and its branches, makes me think, is it dangerous to wander off in a jungle at night alone for a cute looking girl because of:  a)	The evil spirit haunting the jungle b)	The sexually frustrated trees c)	The trees possessed by a sexually frustrated evil spirit d)	The sexually frustrated men masquerading as trees e)	The sexually frustrated men brought up by apes and who now call themselves Tarzan f)	The Apes who brought up Tarzan and now want the real shit g)	The Female Ape who brought up Tarzan, now hates Karchak wants to try another flavor? h)	The sexually frustrated Lesbian Women, Cross dressing as men because that is the most believable disguise (even if a woman rapes another woman, the rape`e would assume that the rape`or was a man because only men are so frustrated so as to impose themselves on unassuming women running topless in an evil infested jungle in the middle of the haunted night).   There could be some other reasons as well, but what I really want to ponder upon here is not how a woman gets raped, even though for some that would be the best part (bloody perverts), I am rather interested in why women get raped while frolicking in the jungle, naked, in the middle of the night. When a man teases a woman (eve teasing I suppose). It is not appreciated by the feminine self-esteem at all. The ass pinching, and breast staring really hurts the feelings, and rightly so, It is unnatural, goes against the nature of mankind, but at the same time conforms with the nature of man, because that is what we do, attack and pillage and rape the poor lil bastard who cannot defend his or her own self.   So if men teasing women is unnatural, then women teasing men should be perfectly natural. All women should tease men, grab asses where ever they see a cute one, stare at crotches, push and shove in trains and buses, fight with friends in loud voices as to who gets to sit with the nice looking guy sitting alone in the back seat. Drop a hankie and ask if he dropped it and then ask if he wants to have sex, or just ask if he wants to have sex, forget the hankie (men like the bloody direct approach) after all, it is only n
