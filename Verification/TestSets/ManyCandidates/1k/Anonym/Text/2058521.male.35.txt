all occurrences of  "\/Count +[0-9]\/Parent"  with  "/Count -%1/Parent" .  With Perl, this hack is applied with   perl -pe 's#/Count ([0-9]+)/Parent#/Count -$1/Parent#g#' in.pdf &gt;out.pdf   The next time you open the modified document with Acrobat you will get a message that the document is being repaired. Just safe it again with Acrobat and everything is fine.   Note : Always make a backup of your PDF document before modifying it, since sometimes the hacks just don't work and you end up with a document that Acrobat cannot repair.
Today I have installed the  urlLink Newz Crawler  client, which was  urlLink mentioned  in Eriks's Linkblog. NewzCrawler is a web news aggregator, RSS reader, browser and blog client which provides access to news content from various sources. Great Software!  Actually, when trying to post to my blog I found out that its built-in BlogThis! client&nbsp;doesn't support specifying or modifying the title of a posting. (I have enabled titles by "Show Titles" in the preference tab of my blogger.com account.) Additionally, the "My Blogs" accounts in Newz Crawler don't show existing titles, either. I have posted a suggestion in the NC forums... In the meantime I use the  urlLink BlogJet  client, which supports everything I need including titles!
After having playing around with extensions for some while, here's my list of extensions I consider "huge usability improvers":    urlLink DictionarySearch : Looks up selected word in an online dictionary by context menu. Hint: You can add custom dictionaries, e.g. "http://dict.leo.org/?search=$".   urlLink Diggler : Adds a button next to the location bar that can clear the location bar (much like the one in Konqueror) and also drop down a menu with more actions.   urlLink Download Manager Tweak : A modification of the Firefox download manager that changes its appearance and allows it to be opened in a separate window, a new tab, or the sidebar.   urlLink Googlebar :  An unofficial Google toolbar for Firefox.  Note: There is also  urlLink GooglebarL10N , which gives you localized version.   urlLink LiveHTTPHeaders : View HTTP headers of a page and while browsing.   urlLink Mouse Gestures : Allows you to execute common commands using mouse gestures.   urlLink ReloadEvery : Reloads webpages every so many seconds or minutes.   urlLink SuperScroll : Override the default keyscroll and mousewheel settings.   urlLink Tabbrowser Extensions : Improves tabbed browsing a lot. Note: This extensions seems to seriously slow-down Firefox.   urlLink Web Search Plus : Uses the current Search Bar engine for context-menu Web Searches.   These two come pre-installed with Firefox:    urlLink Web Developer : Adds a menu and a toolbar with various web developer tools.  Dom Inspector: You'll need to enable this when you install Firefox - choose the 'Custom install' and check the box for 'Developer tools'. The  DOM  inspector allows you to view the 'Document Object Model' for a web page. See  urlLink here  for more information. Also note that the extension manager of Firefox 0.9.2 seems to have a problem with it ( urlLink search Google ).   Note: This list of extensions is an update of my&nbsp;earlier posting  urlLink A look at Web Browsers and File Managers .
