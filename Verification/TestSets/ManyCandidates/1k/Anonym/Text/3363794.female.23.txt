and man it moved fast.  My sister and I had way too much fun in that thing.  We adoringly called it Cobra.  After that, there was a party, I think it was a birthday party for Laurence.  Anyhow, I was dressed in black underwear, a bra, and a big, white down comforter that I was using as a coat.  Dancing and dancing, and making out with some hot guy, who turned out to be some slut hound.  We were all dancing to this song, My Sherona.  Then Laurence said she really wanted fish sticks, that the party just wasn't right without fish sticks.  So I went outside with her for a cigarette to figure out how to get these fish sticks.   More guests show up, Misty Alvarado in a Toyota Corolla.  I haven't seen her in years.  We go back into the house where the party is, by this time the guy I was with is with some other chick, but I don't really care...just start dancing again.  Except this time I don't feel attractive and fun, I feel kind of stupid and like a bad dancer...I sneak back out to the Cobra...  Then I wake up at 8:15am and realize that I am going to be VERY late for work.  I think this dream indicates that I have some issues.  1) For the first time in my life, I am very unhappy with my weight.  I actually think about it a lot.  The bathroom scale, which Michelle swears is right, tells me that I weight 140 lbs.  This is impossible.  Or is it???  My tummy is really not toned.  This time last year, I was something like 118lbs, which is really too skinny, and I have grown some since in the hips anyhow.  Solution: Take taikwondo.  Figure out how to pay for it, and find a teacher.  2) Not happy with dating, boys, guy situation.  I am never going to get a date again.  I feel like they're always looking for something better, and that's not me.  No one I've dated really ever appreciated me like they should have, which makes me think that maybe this is an impossible feat.  I get mad when I don't get enough attention, I get freaked out when I get too much.  I can't trust anyone I'm dating, for what could possibly make them stick around when some hotter, sexier, skinnier, smarter, wittier, more athletic, more talented, more communicative, nicer girl comes along?  These are my experiences.  And most of the men I've been involved with are just lazy, or big pussies, or both.  Big lazy pussy babies, and this raises contempt for them in my heart.  For the whole gender. Solution: Move back in with my cat and stop thinking about men.  3) I miss my friends.  I miss having people around that I really care about, and who really care about me.  It's time to quit moving around so much, and stay in one place for a while.  Solution: Move back to Texas, get a job, get into a good grad s
