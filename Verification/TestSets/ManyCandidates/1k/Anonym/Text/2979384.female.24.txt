many of u must be wondering wat happened to kimmie's blog... as no new entries popped up day after day. i shall unravel dis mystery. i simply had nothing to write!!! to keep it alive, i decided to give a brief itinery of my mundane working life schedule.  0900 - reach office, surf net & msn 1100 - boss comes in, start working on reports 1200 - waits for boss to go for lunch 1300 - thinking whether i shld eat anot 1400 - decided to grab a bite & replenish refreshment 1500 - unpack refreshment 1600 - real work comes in (prepare contracts, surf for info as requested by boss, order stationery, eat biscuits) 1800 - KO (i.e. Knock Off)  anyway, i had wanted to skip lunch initially, cos i was getting really fat, and flabby, and weak. yea yea yea e usual complaints of women!! but in e end, i decided to try the sliced fish noodles stall which lloyd always makan at. sucks man!! no matter how hard to tried to psycho myself tt e bloody bowl of salt water disguising itself as milky soup is darn delicious, i can't help but wonder why i spent $3.80 on such bloody mirk. and there was dis guy who kept making fake coughing noises at the table beside me. he seemed to know that i am irritated and would stare at me and i wld stare back. in e end, he got up, raised BOTH his arms (as though in "sweet" surrender) and walked in a ya ya manner. apparently, tt bloody guy was trying to attract my attention. darn! shldn't have worn a low cut top... :p  after tt, i proceeded to carrefour to replenish the stock in my pantry. thot of getting root beer initially, den decided against it. ultimately bot green tea again. hmm green tea not bad ma. at least its from the shelf named "healthy beverages" lehz. and i just realised tt coke occupied one entire shelf. hmmm... anyone got any new biz ideas?? also, to prevent myself from munching on those evil fat-laden biscuits, i bot stuff which i dun like. let us pray tt kimmie slims down again yea??  im still thinking whether to go ladies nite anot... but dunno where i shld go lehz. even if i go, i dun have kaki. haiz... anyway, b4 i leave, here's an interesting article tt cot my attention while i was surfing tdy... titled  urlLink The Secret Lives of Wives . yea... dis is to make up for e lack of substance in my blog...  Zzz...  uRs tRuLy, pRin~
回忆里想起模糊的小时候 云朵漂浮在蓝蓝的天空 那时候的你说 要和我手牵手 一起走到时间的尽头  从此以后我都不想抬头看 仿佛我的天空失去了颜色 从那一天起 我忘记了呼吸 眼泪啊永远不再 不再哭泣   我们的爱 过了就不再回来 直到现在 我还默默的等待 我们的爱 我明白 以变成你的负担  只是永远 我都放不开 最后的温暖 你给的温暖 不要再问你是否爱我 现在我想要自由的天空  远离开这被捆绑的世界 不再寂寞    uRs tRuLy, p
