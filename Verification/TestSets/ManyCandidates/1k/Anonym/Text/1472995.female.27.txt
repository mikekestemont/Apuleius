to change him completely! Plus I'm afraid that I'll overdose him on pills because I can't remember if I gave him one this morning or not. It's like taking stupid birth control all over again!  We had another "great" experience with JR's girlfriend on Saturday night playing poker. She got so drunk and obnoxious that we had to leave.&nbsp; I had the pleasure of being the only sober one there. I was so sick of telling her what she had to bet and when it was her turn. I had to leave before she caught me rolling my eyes. That girl could beat the shit out of me...and pretty much everyone else who was there. You'll probably see her on Saturday.&nbsp; Let's hope she behaves.
CONGRATULATIONS!!!   that's great news, jen.  sounds like it turned out to be a pretty good week for ya! :)             i know that i told you girls my new address, but now since there are technically 3-units there mine is A.  so it's really 312 s. lopez st., #A          talk to you soon!
Ok! So here is the news that most of you saw go down last saturday at the Cunningham party.......I'm a gettin' hitched!!! John finally did it he proposed to me! Neither one of us can remember what he said to me but it was perfect and of course I said yes!
It's finally official.  Brian emailed me today and I finally quit being a chicken-sh*t and told him that it's over.  I told him that I accept my own part of my misery but I also made sure to tell him that he's the one who did the leaving, not me.  I don't want him out there thinking that girls always leave him and I'm just one in the crowd who hurt him.  If I can take responsibility for my actions and poor decisions, he has to, too.  I offered him something better and he turned it down and then pretty much stopped talking to me with the exception of the monthly email of guilt, and if that's not one way to leave someone, I don't know what is.  If he really loved me or really missed me he would have tried harder to keep me, but he didn't.  I don't need him to make me feel bad; I can do it myself when the situation calls for it, which is something I try to avoid.  What I need is someone who wants to try to make me happy, something else I can do for myself when the situation calls for it, which it always does.  It's hard to decide you deserve to be happy, but if you can find the strength to do it, things can't help but look up, right?  If I can take responsibility for my misery I can take responsibility for my happiness, too.  That's why I bought a house and moved.  It's me taking control of my life and making an effort to make myself happy.  I can only fix me, after all.
Hope you are having a good day, bride-to-be!!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY J
