Once you've got the knack, it's like the old cliche goes, 'just like riding a bicycle'. Which is rubbish cause I think snowboarding is easier!!!   Snow and the activities around it represent something pure and unspoilt by the modern globalized world. Time spent on the snow is your own, it's free from invasion of personal space and privacy. I compare it alot to surfing. For those of us lucky enough to experience a trip to it, a snowy mountain adventure is something that stays with you forever. For those who haven't experienced it yet, plan your leave, save some flow and get there....you won't regret it.  CARPE POWDA!!! seize the powder!!.
I guess the allure of icy wind-blown weather, inconsistent snow falls, and the thought of expensive cramped accommodation are too much to bare for many folks who have never tasted one of winter's finest achievements. For enthusiasts like myself however, winter represents the chance to experience something rare and special, the Australian snow fields. Wind blown pockets of powder, half-pipe and terrain parks, the feeling of cutting edges and carving turns on unspoiled runs, coupled with the unquestionable atmosphere the Snowy Mountain region possesses this time of year are what I have grown to live for.  For me it's hard to imagine any winter without packing for the weekend, dashing out of the office hours earlier than I should on a Friday arvo, diving into a friend's waiting car whilst shouting... "move move before I get caught", and meandering down the Sydney M5 motorway in anticipation of hitting the slopes. It has become an annual festivity for yours truly, and this year will again be no exception.  I can't wait to hear news of the first big dump mother nature throws on the NSW Snowy Mountains!!! Cause when it does I'll be ready to go!!!
There's no doubt that stocking up on new threads for winter is tough. The cost of comfort can leave anyone with that sinking feeling in their stomach the next time the credit card statement comes in. But hey, nothing beats a new board, boots, or gortex laced get up does it!! That's why I'm looking at all the current gnarly gear on offer for season 2004.  I embarked on my retail journey in the heart of the Sydney CBD by visiting a couple of old stamping grounds. As you can see the gear on offer for both the fellas and the ladies this year is nothing short of awesome! Jackets, pants, boards, boots, goggles, gloves, bindings. You name it, it's there to be shnavelled up by the greedy wanna-be, looking to emulate Team Salomon while punching down the treacherous green runs of 'Happy valley' or 'Friday Flats'. Man the tow-ropes back up can be tough!! Just kidding to all the first timers, we all started there!! But for those of us who need the gear to combat the elements at the top of 'International', or even better 'The Saddle' at Whistler-Blackcomb, this apparrel is essential for battling the harsh elements delivered when reaching summits.
