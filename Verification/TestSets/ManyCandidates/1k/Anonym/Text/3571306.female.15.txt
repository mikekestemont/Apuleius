all&nbsp;aren't equal? It's not fair that&nbsp;some people&nbsp;have&nbsp;some things&nbsp;that others envy them for. "It all works out in the end," right? Well where's the end and when's it coming? For many, it can never work out completely. There's only a small possibility that anything will be alright. I know I sound so negative, but it's all true. You always want what you can't have and no one's ever satisfied with what they do possess. There are so many things that can and are denied to you, and there's nothing you can do about it. Compensations are what you recieve instead or nothing is given at all. I feel like I've been denied what I want and denied even a simple compensation instead. But there's a reason for everything, right? Wrong. The only reason I'm not given the things I want or even deserve&nbsp;the most, is because the world is letting&nbsp;others&nbsp;get lucky on my misfortunes. Although, I do have to take into consideration the unlucky&nbsp;events that happen to the fortunate sometimes. I don't see them suffer as much as I usually do though. Either that or they refuse to show it. Wish I could refuse to show my sorrow when I've been dealt a horrible hand. Maybe that's why better things happen to people who don't show their unhappiness. Fate is weaving my tapestry slowly but surely, then snipping the strings faster than the loom can work...
Ah. Finally free. No school, no worries. Damn, it's gunna be a nice 2 months off! *Sigh*...it's off to a better start than any other summer. I was such a loner! (What's the difference from now, eh? '-__-) I'm still a loner at heart ^_~. Anyway...I just came back from the movies and I saw Shrek 2(FINALLY)! I have dubbed thy donkey/dragon/mutant babies, DRAGONKIES! Now I want one! Lol! As you may have guessed, I'm quite sugar high from all that candy I ate at the theatre! ^^; So pretty much, this post is randomness all the way! Muwahahahahahaha! Hah! I can see you shaking your head! Don't you laugh at me! Only I can laugh at me :D! Hehe...well now that that's over, why don't I talk about something, uh, less pointless ^^'? Hmmm, let's see...I saw my brother graduate on Tuesday and it was so weird to see him up on stage! Oh and all the pretty dresses! Ooooh can't wait till I grad! It's going to be soooo fun picking out and trying on dresses until I find the perfect one! But then again, gradding is so nerve-racking. I mean, you gotta go off to college or university after the summer, not lil ol' Claremont anymore. You gotta make it on your own. When I saw the ceremony, I thought to myself, "I'm going to go through this in 3 years,". Three years isn't that long either ya know. It's strange how we've come so far, yet we haven't even seen half of our lives yet. o_O I'm really scaring myself now! Think I'd better go before I start reminiscing about my childhood a
