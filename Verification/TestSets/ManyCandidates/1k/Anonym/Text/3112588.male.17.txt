i actually thought was katy LoL! "It's katy with a nose job, guys!!"...Katy: "That's hot...so hot." LoL good stuff you guys. we got to the movie theatre, i saw some of my old buddies from school (Jessica Fernandes, Beckie Alcantara, etc). btw, congrats to Jessi for getting back together with Daniel Marino..good stuff i guess! sooo we sat through the movie, and laughed at all the scary parts. at one point, a fly flew next to my ear, and i jumped so high! LoL! then, i was getting ready to talk to laura about something, the girl fell into a ditch, and she screamed right in my ear! haha...Adrian Broday (Noah was his name in the movie--great) was the best person. he was like mentally challenged, and he was laughing at all the scary parts--we agreed that he was Silas, for sure. LoL! by the end of the movie, we spent 10 minutes trying to explain the ending to Brittany, b/c she STILL didnt get it. we walked outside and waited for mom (Windy Chite LoL), and still were trying to explain the ending to brittany LoL! we drove brittany home, but of course mrs white cant end the night without a few "great" jokes...so she goes: hey, if you read books, we could call you "Brit-Lit"...and if you played baseball, we could call you "Brit-Mit"....we just stared in awe at the "genius" of it all LoL! laura was just like kept backing up when she made a U-turn, and it was great. so, we finally get to my house, and mom asks me if we had the Lord of the Rings movies, and i told her that we had all of them. so, i went inside to get them, and sara kept saying: yeah? well mine are fullscreen AND the full version!....laura goes: she was talking to NOAH...and i was like: yeah, SARA...guess i must have grew my hair out and started dressing worse! LoL! it was terrible, but so great. soo we were all in the car (katy, sara, mom, and laura) just talking for like 30 minutes...  Mrs. White: lets all do our gollum impressions!! dude, omg--the greatest LoL!! it was sooo terrible, but so great. mom definitely had the best one down for sure! wow..just so many great times tonight, i cant even remember all of them. katy: "we're not laughing AT you...we're laughing NEXT to you!"....Me: "wow katy--only God's laughing"....LoL! mom kept on grabbing laura's hair and sticking it up her hair and saying: "see guys? its laura's nose hair!" LoL seriously, none of us there could have past the straight line test (for drinking), b/c we were just all woosy LoL! good stuff. well, i cant remember a lot of stuff, except for weird noises and Gollum impression, and sara talking about how HOT Mr.White is (yeah...noah, did you know sara smells his underwear? LoL) laura, that was great...well love you guys, and cant wait to make MORE memories...one of the best times i've had all summer. and yes, mom...i WILL cherish it FOREVER! b
