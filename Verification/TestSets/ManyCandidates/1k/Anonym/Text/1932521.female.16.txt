who ever said that dress-up was for little kids was stupid. cuz im proud to say that in this last year alone i have played dress-up at leaste...mmm..18 times. no seriously i think like 5. thats kinda embarrising, but i wear it proudly. i think the only person that should be embarressed is clay, cuz he just looked stupid, or more likea beastie girl as i stated earlier. oh and claire, u looked like u were on every drug possible. sorry.  i want to bring to everyones attention that in the last 3 weeks i have seen david...1ce. ok, i was gone for two of those weeks, but i have been home for like a week and i have seen david 1ce. oh i forgot, hes too busy with every girl in the sophomore class, my bad. david, i thought that we had something, like we had some sort of connection. we went rollerblading around the lake together, that meant so much to me. i thought we were .... friends. **sniff**  moving on  boob-tag was fun last night. but its one of those games that no one wants to play, cuz u can NEVER relax the whole night. ur just reaching acrosse the table for some popcorn or sitting down, minding your own bizznas when....WWHACK...riioot in the boob. but it does keep everyone on their toes. by the way, who is IT?  ok this goes out to someone in paticular, but im not going to say who. i just want u to know that u mean so much to a lot of ppl, more people then u think. u make ppl laugh, and feel really good about themselves, especially me. you mean a lot to me and if anything happened to u i would be devistated. and i know a lot of people that feel the same. what ur thinking about would not help anything, even tho is seems like its only logical thing to do in ur case. but its not. at all. i bet thats what she thought too, but it didnt help a thing and think about how it made u feel, and what it has brought u to considereing. it would just bring more people to to feel what you are feeling right now. it woudl make everything worse. so many people love you, please know that. please, at least think about what i said.  ~)me(~
