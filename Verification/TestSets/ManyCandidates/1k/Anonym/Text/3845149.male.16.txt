the most screwed up timetable in my class. No doubt about that. I'm the only one with a 2 hour break on Monday, a 5 hour break on Wednesday and a 3 hour break on Friday. Oh ya, the goddamn speech thing on Thursday...maybe I'll talk about the benefits of drinking. I don't actually drink, but I look like I drink, so perhaps Cordelia will be convinced. We'll see. Well, she already thinks I smoke anyway. Told ya my face gives people the impression of all that is bad.
I know I look like I want to beat someone up. I know I look pissed. I know I look like I drink, smoke, gamble and fight a lot. And yes, I know I look like I'm in my 20s. So anyone reading this, there's no need for you to tell me...I know. So to whomever it may concern, I do not do any of the above. I know it's hard to believe, but it's the truth. Oh yeah, I AM 17. Anyway, a brief intro: If my blog add didn't tell you already, I hate posers. Posers=people who try to act like someone/something they're not, people who try to show off too much are all goddamn posers. Do not try to be a poser, for everyone's sake. You'll make people dislike you. For the MCM class T103, I think there are a few posers around, tho I'm not going to mention names here, cuz I'm not a gossiping bitch.
I have no idea why people would want to post on a site like this and write a so called "diary". I know this post itself is a contradiction, but maybe I'll see what's so fun about this.
I've seen a certain primary school classmate of mine a few times on the bus on the way home. I used to like her way back when I was still a stupid fat kid in primary school, till early sec 2.  She seems to get prettier every time I see her. Man, I really had foresight. She reminds me of Jacelyn Tay(whom I think is really pretty). They have that same air of classiness(is that a word?). Wanted to ask her out once, but finally decided against it due to certain unresolved issues with myself. Anyway, next time, don't question my tastes in women, because I know I have good tastes. Speaking of women, the OC is coming up later. Can't wait to see Hailey again. Man, she's hot.
Just got my hair cut today. I know people think my hair's already pretty short, but I just got sick of it. Then again, maybe I've told the guy to cut it too short...I can visualise people asking me all kinda questions about it tomorrow. "You cut your hair?" being the most stupid one. I have no idea why people would ask such an obvious question. No, I'm actually wearing a wig, I didn't cut my hair at all. Talk about a bad hair day. Wait a minute...there's not enough hair to have a bad hair day. Ah s
