 Ciao!Ü
Lunch Break   Omigosh. I saw him in Crystal Cove. He looks different- he's wearing glasses and I think it's pretty neat on him... But he dint see me. :( Oh well.  So iniwi, does everybody know my ex called? Both strange and funny.Ü No biggie though. I think it's sweet because they're the people who's close to me. That means they care.

*sigh*   it's gonna be a very loooong day. it's still 4:18 AM and i'm done checking my emails. i'm done checking other blogs. i'm done surfing. i'm done doing whatever it is i usually do while waiting for calls to beep in. time check (again): now 4:20 AM. tick tock tick tock tick tock...  *looks at her fingers closely... and starts talking to herself* you know they're wrinkling- either too much water, or too cold in my workstation. *munches a peanut butter sandwich* yum yum yum! and another thing that i noticed- *she continues* my red veins are very apparent specially if i'm in a cold environment. my skin looks particularly unnatural, and queer, and odd... it makes me wonder... maybe i am a mutant. and i have supernatural powers! with the trace of my fingers i can open up a hole that is a portal to another location- anywhere, wherever! i wanna go to where dennis is! *draws a circle on the floor big enough for entry* tsssssssssssssssssk!!! with one blink of an eye... the portal opened. to where? *scratches head* ummmm... his bedroom (cuz it's still 5:29 AM and he's still sleeping). CLANNNKKK!   "Ouch!!! (silent 'ch')"    "Kinsa na?!!!"    "Sorry! Si Sashi ni. Ikaw?"  I hissed, as if I don't know what's going on.   "Sashi??? Kokong. Hoy, nganong naabot man ka dre?"  Click! *turns on the light*   "Mao nang pangutana na dili ko kabalo unsaon pagtubag, one moment I was in Cebu, the next moment naabot na ko dre."    "Pagtarong diha ba! Nakulbaan bya ko nimo!"    "LAGIIII! Giti-aw man siguro ko! Nanimbarrrroooot akong balahibo!"    "Buing! Walay kla-"  I cut him off.   "Taysa, gawas ra ta beh, kay muuli na lang kos amo."    "Ta."   He opened the door, walks down the stairs to the living room. I followed.   "Kadlawon pa ui. Hulati na lang na muhayag layo pa ra ba tong inyo. Dire na lang ta mamahaw."   TINGGGG!!!    "I don't want to (as if!)- pero okay, hulat na lang ko muhayag."   Chitchat. Breakfast. Then I went home.  And the moral of the story?  Blood is *never* blue. Blood is described as dark red (venous) or bright red (arterial). Our veins look blue because we are looking at them *through* our skin. The blood inside them is dark red and it doesn't reflect light very well. The blood you see when you get hurt is usually venous blood. Arterial blood comes out in spurts. It spurts every time the heart beats.  Source:  urlLink http://www.globalclassroom.org/blublud.html   Cge bye! Break na nako! W
