I'm conscious of the on coming consequences &amp; results. Knowing flowers blossomed will someday die but still chose to pursue my love wholeheartedly. People think that love do not need to be voice out and we can feel it. To a certain extent i agreed, as we can feel the love enveloping us. But still without your acknowledgement, i felt insecure. Just because my understanding of human's complexitivity... Knowing smoking can kills but people still do it... The disappointment is deadly. But i can do nothing. Who can gives me an answer? To question myself not wanting to wait aimlessly. What if there is no answer? Who dares to question the atrocities of life? Who can ever tells me the brink of love is man made or by natural? The answer is to experience by yourself, only this can nurture your behaviour towards life.
If i were to suddenly disappear from here. Will there be anyone to search for me? Can i trust humans kindness? Just have to wait until i was found. Maybe in the darkness, it is easily for me to recollect myself. the more i want it this way, it will turn out the opposite. There are lots of changes made, but my stubborness remains. Don't really likes to do things which i think it will work the way i think because i hate to see my assumption turns out incorrect. As people always praise my intelligence, i more afraid if i cannot prove them right. Am i really that intelligence or am i just lucky? Before i can be myself again, i have to keep on acting. As it is really tiring, thats why i always want to behave like a kid.
