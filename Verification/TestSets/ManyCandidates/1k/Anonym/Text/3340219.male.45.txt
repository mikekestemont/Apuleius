against MSDE, which doesn't include Enterprise Manager, Query Analyzer, and all those other nice tools. With SQL-DMO, I was able to write a small application that enables users to create a new database, install the tables we shipped (mostly blank but some of them were pre-populated), and then load and go.  I encourage you to investigate SQL-DMO further. By descending into the hierarchy, you can walk the list of tables, queries, and so on, using very simple code like the examples above. Once you dive in, it turns out to be very easy, and it can save you lots of time.  Arthur Fuller has been developing database applications for more than 20 years. He frequently works with Access ADPs, Microsoft SQL 2000, MySQL, and .NET.
LinuxWorld Expo kicks off at the Moscone Convention Center in  San Francisco this week, with a slew of announcement from major  vendors. As usual, the new products focus on the use of Linux in  high-end enterprise server platforms. Linux and open  source-based client products and software development platforms  are also being demonstrated.  Among the products being announced at the show this week are:  * Red Hat is expected to launch its first Java application    server, a product that will compete with platforms from BEA, IBM    and Oracle.  * Novell is expected to unveil SuSE Enterprise Server 9.0, which    runs on the Linux 2.6 kernel, providing better support for    multiprocessor systems. It's been reported that systems running    on pre-released versions of the software can scale to 32 Intel    Itanium II processors and handle as much as 512G bytes - that's    Gigs not Megs - of memory.  * HP is expected to announce a range of Linux products,    including Linux-based midrange and high-end Integrity servers    and a Linux thin client, the HP Compaq t5515.  It will also    showcase ProLiant servers with Intel's new 32-/64-bit    technology. HP will announce an expanded Linux services and    support team.  * IBM will announce broader third-party software support for    Linux on its Power processor and will unveil xSeries servers    with Intel's 32-/64-bit technology.  * Veritas is expected to announce that the latest versions of    its storage and clustering software are all certified on Red Hat    Enterprise Linux. Among the tools certified include Veritas    Storage Foundation, Veritas Storage Foundation for Oracle RAC,    Veritas Storage Foundation Cluster File System and Veritas    Volume Replicator.  * Computer Associates plans to announce that it will open source    its Ingres r3 database, which runs on Linux and will be made    generally available Sept. 30.
Warstwa komputerowa jest poszerzona o kolejna warstwe, warstwe identyfikacji. Do tej pory jest warstawa sprzetu, systemu operacyjnego, aplikacji. Pozniej doszla warstwa posredniczaca miedzy aplikacjami i systemem (middleware) a takze warstwa abstrakcji sprzetowej i sterownikow. Teraz doszla warstwa identyfikacji uzytkownika zasobu. O niej mowilo sie na poczatku lat 90, gdy wprowadzono uslugi LDAP. Uslugi LDAP wraz z uslugami zabezpieczenia (security services) utworzyly  obszar (strefe) identyfikacji tzw. identity area. Powszechnie mowi sie o powstaniu nowej warstwy "identity management". Uslugi katalogowe rozbudowane do warstwy identity magmt staja sie powszechne (commodities) i na nich bazuje kolejna usluga web services
