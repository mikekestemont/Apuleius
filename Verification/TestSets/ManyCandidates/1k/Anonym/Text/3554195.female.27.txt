to speak, at the moment.  The moral is, if you're coming to see me in the next few hours, either come bearing pancakes or the ability to speed up time.
I am at work desperately attempting to get an article regarding offsource outsourcing completed before I run to the airport and pick up  urlLink Headstart for Happiness .  Apparently those that live on the dole get to go on long extended vacations, sleep in until noon, watch all the cable they want and often wait until 10.30pm (on weekdays!) to call people up and invite them out for cocktails.    I wish I was liv'n on the dole.
To the person who found my site based on the following search " urlLink jerry o'connell jerk poker ":  You're my kind of people.  Stop by any time.
urlLink    Today is Danny's birthday.  Last  night, in honor of the occasion we dined at The Palace Kitchen.   urlLink    I* am coveting Danny's birthday presents so fiercely my glare quite possibly ignited a forest fire; perhaps even multiple forest fires.  But seriously, who doesn't love birthday presents.  Give them to  me !  All of them!   urlLink    Because there was some serious drinking involved, it kind of slipped my mind that I should get at least one good group shot.  As you can see this didn't happened.  By the way, don't ask.  I have  no  idea.   urlLink    Apparently after a cosmo and a couple glasses of red wine I like to tap dance in the street.   urlLink    What a bunch of asses!

While we did indeed soak in said tub, few pictures were taken there mostly because we were preoccupied by all the drinking.  That, and we were in a hot tub and I don't know if you've heard or not but electronics and water decidedly do not mix.  We did, however, figure out that mixing Gatorade with Vodka isn't half bad (according to some).  I passed on that though.  I've already got my quota of retardolites thank you very much.   I could tell what happened on into the wee hours of the morning, but then I'd have to kill you or rather if I told you, most likely, you'd die...of boredom.  Let's just say the conversation included an angry drunken debate about football players and their worth or lack thereof depending on your perspective, the Democratic Convention, Justin Timberlake and plans around our trip to Europe among other things**.    *I am the one in Pink! suprise, suprise. **I wish I was being coy.  I'm not.  I really don't remember what else we talked about but I'm sure it was very, very funny.  Truly.  My friends are quite funny but because I don't remember any specifics you're just going to have to trust me on this o
