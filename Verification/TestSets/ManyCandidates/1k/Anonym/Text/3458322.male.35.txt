There were rumors floating around about who did it. I heard a couple of kids say they probably new who did it. That day I just didn't want to attend gym class. The regular gym teacher was in, and I new there was going to be some hell to pay. I changed and walked into the gym, the substitute teacher was standing there next to the gym teacher. This time the bees were not active, all of us were quite.   I Looked at the substitute teacher and I felt really bad. He was an older man, just probably trying to get some extra money. The guilt was killing me. Would I get caught? Did someone see me do it? Will I get suspended? What will my parents say? No one would ever guess, that I would of done this. The gym teacher had each student walk into his office and give a name if we new who did it. I was scared, really scared. Everyone had been threw his office, the time had come. He lectured us a little bit and then had us run a couple of laps.   I will never forget that day, the day I will regret for the rest of my life. The time I kept quite, so I wouldn't get in trouble for something I did, and new was wrong.   The substitute was an older man then, this was about twenty-two years ago. Poor old man (God rest his soul) is probably not with us any more. I will live with this the rest of my life, the day I hit an old man with a tennis ball. If your still out there MR. Substitute teacher in the six grade, I'm deeply sorry!

In addition, I learned to take out extra words out of my sentences, and pay more attention to what I was writing.   What was hard? Expectations on my writings. Not knowing if my writings were up to standard for this course.
Things were going really well with my paper then it came down to finding material to actually research my paper, and I just didn't find anything that I felt was very helpful. The internet was a great site for information, but that was it. I needed more, the library was a very helpful research tool and one I had available. So I changed the subject of my paper to one of my original subjects. Instead of doing the Nijmegen paper, I decided to do it on "Fitness Walking", as a physical fitness exercise. I'm glad I did because the subject for me was much easier to r
