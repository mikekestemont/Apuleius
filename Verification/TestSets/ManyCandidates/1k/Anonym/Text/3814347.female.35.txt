Thought I'd drop an email to my blog and see if it worked and posted itself....Not much to write about today, I'm very tired.&nbsp; Didn't sleep well last nite, Cassidy wouldn't give me enough space, we have to get the king size bed installed...hopefully Michael will work on the bedframe today, the ole' queen size is just not cutting it anymore, and it just kills my back....ah yawn.&nbsp; Dinner last nite was awful and I'm really sick of people who can't cook getting in the kitchen and ruining food for 70! I mean if your gonna take on such a job as cooking dinner for 70 people at least make something half edible!! I think pregnancy makes me testy about food issues....I went to the doctor this past tuesday and gained 3lbs in 5 weeks....not so bad not so great...I mean I have to face the fact I'm going to gain weight, I'm pregnant, it happens...I just don't want to gain too much...but dang I'm sooo hungry all the time....my stomache is growling right now!! I'm really into stuffed  jalapenos lately, stuffed with cream cheese, wrapped in bacon and grilled..ooooh god can't get enough of them. Well I'm gonna get going, time for a snack!&nbsp; I hope we get the storms they are predicting for today!! I hear thunder.   		 Do you Yahoo!?  Read only the mail you want -  urlLink Yahoo!

ack....the weather here has finally taken a turn for the worse and summer has begun, I usually love summer but being pregnant two summers in a row is a bit much.
