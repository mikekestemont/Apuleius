you ever get annoyed when other people comment on the amount of people you date?  Only when they say bad stuff. Like "You'll never find a boyfriend that way" or "No wonder you're still single" or "You're such a slut" or "Why can't you be straight?"  G: Guilty. Do you ever feel guilty about dating all the guys that you do?  Starting to. I'm realizing that there is a distinct possibility I might actually go on a date with someone I like. And then I have to get rid of the riffraff.  E: Eye Opener. Do you ever have a man when you get up, first thing in the morning, in order to start your day?  No comment.  I was thinking about all of this because I think I have been rejected, on various levels, a record six times over the past 2 days. And I'm getting the shakes. It was like the hangover from a man-speedball.  Most people would be like...eh...you had six guys in limbo over the past 2 days, you certainly can pick up where you left off and replace them quickly. But me, being the addict that I am, get all dry-mouthed and frothy, and start to look all desperate while begging people for a piece of man-crack. I got all drunk and flirty at Berlin, and it was ridiculous, and more unsuccessful than it needed to be.  So, I almost quit cold turkey. I was so delirious that I locked my phone, made it so I could not do anything except receive calls and call my best friend, and nearly cried myself to sleep.  Fortunately, I woke up in the morning and decided that I was being totally ridiculous, unlocked my phone, and went to a barbecue with my friend Kevin. I've been thinking about my man-addiction treatment program. Cut back on the men? Attach a less potent man to my arm and wean myself off of them altogether? Or is cold turkey the answer?  The first thing I'm going to do is admit I have a problem.  I need help. As I was reading my psych text, I realize that some of my man problems have to do with a pattern I have of injustice collecting, i.e. look at the horrible way in which this man did me wrong, blah blah blah. I think that, while I attempt to be forgiving and understanding, it tends to be more important  for me to be the one done wrong in any given situation. It is comfortable for me, it is a way for me to regain control of a bad situation. Then, to avoid the horrible feeling, I just seek out another man, equally terrible, to replace the one I just lost. I'm not quite sure what the right way to be dumped is, but, if I find out, I'll let you know. Because, I'm one step away from being that crack ho who tells the boyfriend not to date anyone until I find someone. When I get to that point, somebody take me to the h
