yet. Jessica got to go with me, and she helped pick out Jennifer's. Jessica's shoes are a bit big, but she picked those out herself. I called Jennifer while I was shopping, I knew the style she wanted, but once I got there, I found some real cute pink and white shoes that I thought she's like better, so I described them to her on the phone. She said yes. She loves them. (5 pair of Nike's) I also bought 6 water bottles, 5 bracelets (Lance Armstong ~ "LIVE STRONG".), an OSU hat & four 6-packs of socks. All for $235.00 Retail, that would have been at least $400.00 easily.  Such a kewl perk. I can go back once per month on a guest pass. Nike employees can go as often as they like. I wouldn't be able to afford to do that. But then again, if I had the chance to go all the time, I wouldn't be buying in bulk for the whole family.  Next time, I'm taking sizes and styles for my friends for shoes. LOL!!! The t-shirts are $10.00 our cost! The kewl nike ones!!! And yes, the security front desk said if I was buying for other people to make sure that I got the right size, If they were a 11.5 or maybe 12, get both cuz there are no exchanges. Only refunds. There were two gals in there buying at least 20 pair of shoes! They had them all stacked up!!! And it was okay!  Anyways, I was so excited to get to go. I am very happy with my purchases, and look forward to the next time I get to go shopping! OH oH, Nike backpacks are $16.50!!  I have been so busy with work and my newly adopted 17 month old, that i've not had time for the blog time like I use to have.  Matthew is 17 months old. His parents were found to be abusive, and the state took him when he was 1 years old.  The parents signed over the right to allow the adoption and he's now ours. I'm so happy, but so tired. He's blonde and blue eyed, very healthy now. He's slowly learning to follow simple requests, like no, and come here Matthew. He calls us momma and daddddddaa. LOL! He's not fond of Jessica only because he gets into her stuff and she tells him no and removes him from the area. He hates that.  Callie, my kitty, is so tolarant of him. Matthew will lay on the kitchen floor, looking under the dish case (old bookcase), and Callie is under there -hiding. But not running away. It's funny. She's wanting to teach him to be nice, she take a step or two away from him, and he follows her. Only when he pets her nice, does she stay within reach. Otherwise, she slowly moves away. Step by step... LOL! Parker is still afraid of Matthew when he cries. He doesn't know if he's coming or going when Matthew's crying. He just runs and h
