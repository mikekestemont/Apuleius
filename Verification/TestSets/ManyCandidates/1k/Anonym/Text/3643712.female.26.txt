would be FINDING A JOB.  We did make a mistake of not packing enough CD's with us in the car.  We only had the 6 that were in S's CD changer.  After hearing those same 6 CD's about 30 times we finally had to stop and buy some new ones.  We stopped at a Wal-Mart in some BFE town to see what they had.  That was a mistake.  Their selection was crap.  I had been in a somewhat Euro-pop mood, but amazingly enough they don't have much of a selection of that in Podunk, North Carolina or whereever the hell we were.  After I bit the head off of some poor sales idiot for confusing the Stone Roses with the Stone Temple Pilots (hello?) we made due with a couple of compilation discs (like "Hits of the 80's" or something like that).  That was fun.  We thought about putting the top down and singing along as we drove, but that's not much fun when you are speeding along at 85 mph.  Just to let you know, we do not have internet (or phone) service set up yet so I will not be fully online for a few more days.  I will have to make due with some other means of internet access.  I'm hoping there will be a Starbucks or some other Wireless Access Point near our apartment so that I can connect that way.  I figure there are several places like that in Harvard Square, and that is only a couple of blocks from our new place.  Well its getting late and it has been a long day.  I think I'm gonna hit the shower and curl up in bed with S.  I'll post again soon!  Kisses - Carrie
Hiya Peeps!  This is gonna be a quickie today. We have to get back on the road in a few minutes. We stayed the night in Atlanta. We are not quite as far as we were hoping but that's mostly due to getting a late start on Tuesday. We had to do some last-minute stuff before we left so we did not leave town until noon or so. Then we had to stop somewhere near Beaumont to vacuum out the car thanks to a bag of chips that exploded when I tried to open them. I guess I don't know my own strength! We did not feel like sitting in shards of cool ranch doritos for 1800 miles so we found a carwash and sucked out the car.  Thanks to all the delays we were only able to make it to Baton Rouge that night. We tried to make up some time by driving 500-something miles to Atlanta. We could have gone further but we were both getting kinda zoned after 8 hours in the car, so we decided to stop and find a place to stay the night.  Well I am paying for this by the minute so I'm gonna sign off. I miss everyone and I will try and post a better update at our next stop!  Kisses - C
