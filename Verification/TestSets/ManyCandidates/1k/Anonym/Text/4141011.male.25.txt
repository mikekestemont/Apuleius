and other important people up there went pretty well.  I practiced what I would say and got each slide down to the important stuff.  When I was presenting the audience stopped me to ask questions and make comments.  I think I could do it again if I had to.   I did get stressed out a bit by it.  My blood sugar shot up to 250 something.  When I came home I just collapsed with a nap for almost 2 hours.  Today is more ordinary.  I just finished eating my PB sandwhich for lunch and am about to continue doing the same old same old.   Tonight is the final episode of Joe Schmo 2. Should be good.
I have a presentation today at 10am.  In just a few short moments.  I am nervous and just want it over.  Nothing to worry about.  Just do what you had practiced.
Today I got up and went to work. I arrived about 15 minutes after 9. I had another cheeseburger for lunch. I usually don't eat cheeseburgers but since I've been out of bread for my PB sandwhiches I have relied on imitation meat cheeseburgers from the deli downstairs in my office building. I had a Diet Dr Pepper to go along with it. I think I should cut down on my soda intake. The acid levels from the soda can't be good for my teeth and stomach. After lunch I continued working on my presentation.  I am giving a technical briefing next Monday to some higher ups in my division. It pretty much is a way to give me exposure. I don't like presenting material especially to my superiors. It can be intimidating even though I am the expert on the subject. The briefing is scheduled for 10 am and should last 30 minutes. My power point presentation consists of slides with pictures. I plan on speaking to my audience rather than reading slides to them (If only I can do that).  I left work with a headache. I came home and turned on the news and snoozed for about an hour before getting something to eat. I had ramen noddles and mini-ravioli. Now I am watching the Braves game.  Overall the day was tiring. I need to get more sleep, but I think I am getting enough. Maybe its my matress that keeps me tossing and turning at night. Maybe its something else.
Well this is the start of my blog.   I just have to try this blog thing out because it seems the biggest thing since gigapets.   Anywho, today I got up around 8 am, drove into work.  There was a branch meeting.  Then I had a cheeseburger for lunch.  Came home around 6 pm and picked up my package from the leasing office.  I had received notice from Fedex that my wireless PCI adapter was delivered.  I got the NIC hooked up and started discovering the wireless networks in my area.  Then I had a microwave dinner and watched Family Guy.  The day is almost over and I shall be heading off to b
