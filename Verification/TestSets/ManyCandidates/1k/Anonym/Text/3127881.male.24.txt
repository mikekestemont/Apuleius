managed to give C one last shot at action.  However, when we finally got to my place,  we had no way of getting her home and then that led to the awkward email exchange in the minivan headlights.  (she drove a minivan)  I went to bed but this was after pondering, "will i blow chuncks" on the back porch.  I decided I wouldn't and if i did it would have to be in bed.   Anyway, I woke up on Sunday, realizing that I don't have my keys, thank god the door was unlocked.  I started piecing together the night and eventually remembered Dan's last name because his dad is a Judge near Cleavage (new name for Cleveland).   I looked in the phone book and there is only one Dan with that name, and sure enough, he is still asleep.  I felt really awkward, but I had to get my keys back.  "Dude, this is B, the guy that hung out with you last night.  Umm, do you have my keys?"  It was weird, but not half as weird as going to pick them up from his place.  I felt like I had just had a one night stand and left my purse at his house with all my credit cards and shit.  I now know what the walk of shame feels like.   It was this extremely weird night and morning with some of the coolest people on earth that concluded the weekend and I had to drive C to meet his parents.  Kind of anti climactic, but it worked.  Hopefully I see Dan out again one night and we can rekindle the flame.
Mr. A, is this what you mean by 2 b-holes?  It's an article written by Chuck Palahniuk (Fight Club), and was published in Playboy.  If i had to  urlLink read it  (ed: NSFW), you have to, too.

It turns out Curves is an excercise facility exclusively for women. I still want to go. Maybe even more now.
I tried the new Coke C2 last week. I'm having another one right now. I kind of like it. It tastes better than regular Coke, has half of whatever it is people think is bad right now, and it isn't sickeningly sweet. Nice. Fluffy.  A bunch of us were watching Conan today at lunch. It was hilarious even though it was a rerun. He was going around to experts in antique cars and trying to convince them that his '92 Taurus was worth a lot of money. He would demonstrate things like the cup holder or the radio. He would sing at the top of his lungs for an entire song while this stuck up prick is sitting next to him not knowing what to do. He ended up giving the car to Brad Pitt, but only after he (Conan) stripped down to his boxers and tried on some armor and a skirt. Wow. Scratchy.  That's all I have to say right n
