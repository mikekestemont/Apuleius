help going to the top tier and the dregs to the lower (male) tier.  How are you helping to stop the fracturing of society that as a taxpayer I could end up paying for?  As your website is seen by millions I wish to know what further action you intend to take.
urlLink The Gender-Freedom Alliance UK: homeoffice.gov.uk Gender issues raised. : "In light of the 1994 MORI poll conducted for the BBC's Here and Now which revealed that 6.3 million people across 150 constituencies have been subjected to physical aggression by a wife, husband or heterosexual partner with the greater proportion of the victims being male: why do you still attempt to hold such an untenable possition 10 years later.  http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime/domesticviolence/"   This was the opening of an email sent a month ago to the home office.  They have finally responded and the letter is reporduced in whole here:   Dear Mr Brown   Thank you for your email of 26 June to the Home Office regarding male victims of domestic violence.  I have been asked to respond to your email.  Across Government, we are indeed committed to preventing domestic violence from happening in the first place, and protecting and supporting those who are victims regardless of their gender, whilst also working to dispel the myth that men are always the perpetrators of domestic violence and women are the victims.  We want to ensure that people are aware that men as well as women can be, and are, victims of domestic violence and this is why we have included a provision in the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Bill to expand the definition of associated person, as set out in the Family Law Act 1996, to include same-sex cohabiting couples. We are also working closely with a range of specialist organisations around how best to support those from different communities.  In December 2003, the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Bill was introduced to the House of Lords.   The Bill is a significant part of our work in tackling domestic violence, with the aim of placing victims and witnesses at the centre of the Criminal Justice System.  This builds onto the Government's ongoing reform of the justice system in favour of victims and witnesses rather than offenders.  Measures in the Bill are gender neutral and include: ·	Making breach of a non-molestation order a criminal offence ·	Giving cohabiting same sex couples the same access to non-molestation and occupational orders as heterosexual couples ·	Making couples who have never cohabited or been married eligible for non-molestation and occupational orders ·	Issuing guidance on the setting up and conduct of domestic violence homicide reviews ·	Making common assault an arrestable offence ·	Enabling courts to impose restraining orders when sentencing for any offence ·	Enabling courts to impose restraining orders on acquittal for any offence ·	Giving any person mentioned in a restraining order a right to make representations in court if an application is made to vary or terminate the order I hope this demonstrates the Government's commitment to tackling domestic violence and ensuring that perpetrators are held accountable.  Yours sincerely,   S**** O
