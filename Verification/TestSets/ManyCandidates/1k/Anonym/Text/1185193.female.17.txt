a good laugh!  Rumor is he's not  that  bad in tap, but jazz in another story.  I still remember him  trying  to dance at the Bell mixer.  My friends and I laughed for hours after seeing him try!  It's a spectacle that everyone should witness sometime in their lives!
My favorite quotes from  urlLink Tuesdays With Morrie :    "When he smiles it's as if you'd just told him the first joke on earth."              "...your soul, perfectly awake, is imprisoned inside a limp husk."     "Accept what you are able to do and what you are not able to do; Accept the past as past  without denying or discarding it ; Learn to  forgive yourself  and to forgive others;  Don't assume that it's too late to get involved ."     "My days were full, yet I remained, much of the time, unsatisfied."     "Dying is only one thing to be sad over...Living unhappily is something else."     "The culture we have does not make people feel good about themselves. And you have to be strong enough to say if the culture doesn't work, don't buy it."     "So many people walk around with a meaningless life. They seem half asleep, even when they're busy doing things they think are important. This is because they're chasing the wrong things. The way you get meaning into your life is to devote yourself to loving others, devote yourself to your community around you, and devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning."     "If you really want it, then you'll make your dream happen."     "The most important thing in life is to learn how to give out love, and to let it come in."     "Everyone knows they're going to die, but nobody believes it.  If we did, we would do things differently."     "We are too involved in materialistic things, and they don't satisfy us. The loving relationships we have, the universe around us, we take these things for granted."     "Don't cling to things, because everything is impermanent."     "You have to find what's good and true and beautiful in your life as it is now."     "And while his body was stiff as a sandbag, you could almost see him dancing inside it."     "Don't let go too soon, but don't hang on too long."     "But as his body rotted, his character shone even more brightly."     "The closer he got to the end, the more he saw [his body] as a mere shell, a container of the soul."
