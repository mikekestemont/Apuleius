and I am willing to take the hit for something I believe in." Alienating fans is a definite possibility, Mills said, "but I believe the outcome of this election is far more important even than my career."     He quotes Ms.Raitt and Mr.Mills in the article before introducing them in context. Bite me, I'm in William Safire mode tonight.  Other excerpts from the article and commentary:     The artists will tour under the name "Vote For Change," with money generated going to America Coming Together, a political action group affiliated with the liberal group MoveOn and aimed at defeating President George W. Bush. Other musical acts participating nationally include the Dixie Chicks, Pearl Jam, Dave Matthews Band, Jackson Browne, Bonnie Raitt, James Taylor, John Mellencamp and Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds. Other artists a could be added, organizers said.     All members of "the usual suspects". Nothing to see here, move on.     Mark McKinnon, the media director for the Bush campaign, said, "We think it's unfortunate these particular fine musicians have decided to affiliate with a hate-filled fringe group like MoveOn." But McKinnon said that Bush had drawn his own support from the entertainment world, citing stars like Lee Ann Womack,Kid Rock and Jessica Simpson.     What?  Who the hell is jessica simpson? Now animated characters have a voice in presidential politics? Who does  urlLink Bug-eyed Earl  support? Enquiring minds want to know, dammit.     Mills said artists are donating their services. All funds raised beyond expenses will go to America Coming Together.     "All funds beyond expenses" indeed. Have you seen the cost of cocaine lately? "America Coming Together" is going to get stuck with one hell of a bar tab.     There have been a number of highly publicized efforts to encourage election participation, particularly by young people, among them Rock the Vote. Mills said he thinks the combined effort of everyone involved will get attention and make an impression.   Hell, it got billyjeff elected.....     "It's not so much myself, or R.E.M., or any one artist that's involved in this. It's the fact that there are so many, coming from such diverse places on the musical spectrum, all coming together for this single purpose," he said.     Bravo to this Mr.Mills, whoever he may be. Go read the article, he comports himself as understanding how it works.  And I'm all for encourging election participation. Ab-so-fookin-lutely. Just don't stand on queue next to me in the voting line with your UAW "Vote for the following people" card in hand, unless you want an ear-full.     Raitt added that thought the purpose of the concerts is political, the focus will be on this music.       "We don't see hours of haranguing speeches and 20 minutes of music," she said.     Not fookin' likely. More people lit up American flags and pictures of GWB at this year's "AnnArbor Hash Bash" than they did joints.  Reach Roger LeLievre at rlelievre@annarbornews.com.
