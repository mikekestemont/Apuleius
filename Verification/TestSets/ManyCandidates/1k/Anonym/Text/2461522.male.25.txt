at the McKelvey conference, you were lucky enough to see my blog on a BIG SCREEN.  One - such as Tof - might think that seeing it on the big screen would make the experience better...much like watching your favorite action flick or a football game.  However, some things are best experienced in the privacy of one's home.  I really think reading my blog is a personal experience.  I know I strive for such an effect.  I always write each entry with the hope of connecting with each and every reader at a one-on-one level.  So in reality, reading it on a big screen in a large group cheapens the experience for everyone involved.  Way to go, Tof.
Welcome to the 4th of July edition of my blog.  I'm frantically typing to make the midnight deadline, but I think I'm going to miss it.  Ok, just passed midnight.  So now, welcome to the 5th of July edition of my blog!  I guess not quite as exciting.  What is exciting is Greece winning the Euro Cup.  The country's biggest claim to fame before this accomplishment was probably the success of a television character of name "Uncle Jesse."  Some EITMers and I went to Raleigh for the fireworks.   We're all about the three F's.  Fun, fireworks, and funnel cakes.  We had two out of those three, which ain't too shabby.  There was some discussion of a fourth F, but I'll stick with just those three.
If things don't work out at Duke, I'll probably apply to  urlLink CGNU .
I have a secret admirer. I found in my mailbox at school today a package from Amazon.com, which was quite curious considering I didn't order anything. I opened it up to find Hamilton's time series analysis book. That is one big book. I think it's bigger than the bible. Oh, I guess it's not from a "secret admirer", since the invoice had the name of the person it was billed to...so I guess just an admirer. Jim, thanks for the book!  There was an excellent episode of 7th Heaven on the other day. It discussed the dangers of addiction to drugs - actually just stimulants, such as caffeine from coffee. I mentioned it to Bruno (an authentic Brazilian). Of course, he loves coffee and thinks coffee-addiction...I mean coffee-consumption...should start at an early age (say 2nd grade). Ok, that's not true. Anyway, his reaction to the "moral" of the episode wasn't nearly as violent as I had expected/hoped.  Speaking of 7th Heaven...I had an exciting time at church the other day. I went to the Sunday school class for the first time at this one church I've sporadically attended the past year or so. It was kind of funny, because I don't think anyone in the class works full-time, and I was also the youngest person by far (by about 30 years). I'm almost certain that every other person was retired. It was either go to that class or to the married couples class. They were all so sweet...and old. I think I'll be going back next w
