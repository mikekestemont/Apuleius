through and I wake up every day with pains all over.  So we ordered a new bed.  We went online because we thought we'd find one cheaper online and indeed we did - no idea what the mattress will be like though.  Probably the cheapest one you can get knowing our luck.  That said though, atleast hopefuly the springs will not be poking out through the top layer.  we ordered this bed 3 weeks ago.  Still nothing from the people who are supposed to be delivering it.  I wouldn't usually complain but I feel really ill this morning.  That might not have anything to do with our sleeping conditions but in this frame of mind I'm inclined to blame anything! lol.  So Saul had a half day today at uni, and therefore we got a lie in.  In fact we stayed in bed until about 10.30 and then he got up, got dressed and left.  Only when I got up to kiss him goodbye did I realise that our back gate in our courtyard was open.  Its always locked so that perplexed me a bit.  I shouted out of the door to Saul, why is our back gate open?  He said in reply "Because the man is painting our back door and windows...."  Yeah great - everything gets a lick of paint.  Thats got to be good.  But he could have asked!  I was wandering around the flat in my wee shorts with my comfy but rather explicit skin tight vest top.  Its been so hot here (in the UK we have not got used to heat yet - we don't get much of it) and so I've been tossing and turning in bed ending up on top of the covers most nights.  The result of this is that I look as rough as a badgers arse when I get up - and who was I confronted with?  Some slobby looking hairy bloke with a grin on his face staring in.  So I've barricaded myself in lol.  I'm in the lounge with the door shut and the curtains pulled together so the twat can sit outside and wonder what I'm doing but not know lol.  I mean he could have knocked on the door to ask if he could come into our back garden..........it wouldn't have taken much.  In the meantime I feel sick.  I don't know why.  I've got a toxic feeling in my stomach which would usually have been put down to lots of fizzy drinks the day before or alcohol but I had neither of these things yesterday.  In my paranoid mind I'm thinking "oh my god what if I'm pregnant" but I'm trying to keep a lid on that thought at the moment.  Anyway I'll leave it there for now and will write more when I get a chance.  Not much to report today really other than feeling sick and the pervy bloke at the window.  Hopefuly the feeling will pass.  I don't have the money at the moment to buy any medication for a bad s
