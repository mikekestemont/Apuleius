could be allowed free play. But, again, the limiting factor might be how the interviewing, etc., is done. As long as the interviewer is not set on limiting the conversation, then there is potential.  But, this does lead to something else. Reading through the  urlLink Barzun book  (which I would strongly recommend - Barzun is an excellent author, and quite in a league of his own), there is this one question - do any of us know  how  to be conversationalists anymore? Or are the very manners of conversation today stymied?  To rephrase: consider a conversation you have had, any conversation where ideas may enter in (literary, political, theological, aesthetic, whatever). Do you and the others flesh out points, willing to show ( sans  acrimony) contradictions or leaps in logic, and able to see the bigger picture through examples (while not getting locked into concerns about minute and irrelevant specifics on the examples)? Or are we restrained, to a certain extent, by our own manners and, for lack of a better term, social "rules-of-play"? Do we instead look for a consensus, trying to avoid ripping the other apart, or (on the other hand) defend one's own position not in terms of finding Truth but rather holding the line, all the while finding nits to pick with the opponent?  Sadly, this is a portion I have not thought through terribly well (as the previous paragraph no doubt illustrates), but it is another element perhaps worth considering. Do our rules of conduct in conversation today allow for real conversation? Or do we rather chit-chat nicely, reaching no end (or at best, to agree to disagree without strenuous effort)? I don't know. I will have to think on it more. But I do thank Mallarme, Chris, and Mr. Teachout for their enlightening voices. Hopefully, if we can continue in discussion, perhaps we will reach conversation, and in the very process of doing so, find the truth in the matter.
Seeing the interest in the topic of  urlLink conversation , I'm planning on having a new post regarding the matter in the near future (but, since I hope to make it worthwhile, best to check back in a couple of hours from now).  In it, I hope to get into a discussion...well, a written discussion...with some of the other ideas thus far presented - from  urlLink Mallarme ,  urlLink Chris , and  urlLink Terry Teachout .  For those of you coming from  urlLink About Last Night , welcome.  Please feel free to search about the blog, and come back again.   And for those regular readers familiar with my love of that page, Terry  freakin'  Teachout linked here!!!  This is (for me) the weblog equivalent of reaching Valhalla.  Life is good.  Stay tuned, true believers - more to come soon....
