I'm also really nervous about seeing my ex-boyfriend.  I haven't seen Brenton (Buggy) since...well, since school ended.  It's just been really, really, really different this summer.  I don't mean that like it's been bad, just different.  Last summer, Buggy and I were together for the whole summer, going right into school.  Now I'm with Randy, and he's not going to be there for me everyday (not that he doesn't want to be there, just with him living in Montvile, being 19, my strict parents, ect...we're not going to be seeing each other as much).  I don't want anything to end between us, but more than that, I don't want to be with him as school starts, be totally content, and in a few weeks hear him say, "I met this really great girl in one of my classes."  Ugh.  That would be  urlLink total devestation.   We discussed this briefly last night, but once again, no real progress was made concerning everything.  We are walking on eggshells.  There's stuff we just won't discuss because we're afraid it's going to spark conflict and fighting.  And it's really sad, when a relationship has to be like that, but what can I do?  Every time we try to have a "talk," things get about 93824793287 times worse.  It should be really easy.  I like him, he likes me.  End of story, right?  WRONG.   Relationships are, unfortuantely, not that easy.  I wish they were.
Today was really, really, really bad.  I didn't get home from babysitting and get to bed until about 2:30 this morning...On the plus side of that I got $150 for babysitting for the night.  But, I had to get up at seven this morning to work and I was so tired.  Not to mention, I felt horrible when I got up this morning and I've been feeling sicker and sicker all day.  My throat is sore, I have a fever, and my eyes are really sore.  I have to get up at 7:30 tomorrow because I have to babysit again, but then I should be all set with waking up early for the week.  Today is Randy's birthday!  Happy Birthday Randy!!  I    Wednesday is my visit to Salve Regina; I'm really excited.  When Andrew and I went on the tour together, I  loved  it.  I mean it, I have a serious infatuation with this school.   So all that has to happen is that my parents have to decide that the Newport "lifestyle" isn't too....Newport for me, I guess.  Oh well.  So, I'm off to rest and watch some television, because I'm still feelin' pretty shitty.  Call my cell phone and cheer me up!!
All in all, it's been a pretty crappy night, until I came home and decided to start a new blog.  So here you all go, have a blast reading it.  I'm just going to post some lyrics for tonight, because it was pretty horrible.  I don't want to start in on Randy, so i'll just leave that for after I calm down a little bit.                                           urlLink Jeff Buckley-Just Like A W
