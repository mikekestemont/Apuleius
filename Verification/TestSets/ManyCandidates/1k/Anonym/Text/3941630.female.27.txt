referring is what I like to call the 'almost cry'. It comes at you in 4 second spurts with one split second of hopeful silence in between. This isn't the first time Connor has produced this cancer causing sound however, it is the only sound in his arsenal which drives me to utter frustration. I can take repeated No's! I can take a full on crying tantrum but the 'almost cry', that's his trump card. I feel a bit guilty about my frustration but I'm just not used to that behavior from my son. I don't understand where it comes from as there is no predictability behind it. The only common factor is Joey. You would think that he woke up in the morning and covered himself in a sugar spread the way this kid is drawn to him. My poor husband does the best that he can, he really does.

It was really great to have my mom in town to share in my day to day life with me.  She was the first family member to come out and see the new house and she loved it. Yea!      I hope that she had a great time as I know I did.  We traveled out to some area lakes, bought homemade apple pie from farmers, through the birthday party of the year and even made a day trip to Yosemite.  What a beautiful place.  I find myself once again with the renewed vigor to make some changes around here.  What they are and when they will occur has yet to be seen.  All I know is that I've been in a rut lately and I'm bored of it.  It's time to take back me!  This is a good thing though, a breath of fresh air if you will.  Thanks to my mom I'm remembering the me I like to b
