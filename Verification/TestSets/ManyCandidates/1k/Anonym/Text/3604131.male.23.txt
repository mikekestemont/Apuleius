this hot-ass girl move her body like you've never seen before, and while we are both taking in the scenery all I can think about is taking her (my girl) home and crushin some guts. I'm definitely a sex addict, and so is she, but last night I was fiendin like never before. She has a bangin bod and the halter w/ no bra was just killing me. So we left about 2:30, even though the music was really starting to get good, b/c I couldn't wait any longer. Talk about an addiction.....  Finally, we get back to her house and I play the old "I'm tired" routine. Of course this throws her into attack mode and before long her lips are hugging my munky in a way that just can't be described on this blog. After I got off (which was obviously quicker than usual b/c I wanted her so damn much), my not-so-little friend was still awake. Usually he has to take a short nap before round two but this time he was like, "bring it on beyaatch!" So after she got off a couple times, we figured we should move to the floor to cut down on the noise factor a little bit. Without the distraction of a headboard and all the other noises associated w/ sex in the bed, it was time to really have some fun. After several more deep thrusts, some dirty talking, and a lot of heavy breathing....she got off once more and I finally climaxed for the second time. End of story.  In the morning, I tried to get some luv before getting ready....nope, denied. It's one of the first times I've been rejected. Usually she's the one that wakes me up in the morning to fulfill my duty. Go figure, the one time I'm wide awake and ready to go....nothing. Women are weird creatures. But that's another post all together.  Chau
To summarize what would be a short novel of a post....  My girlfriend's sister is putting her through hell and basically trying to sabotage our relationship b/c she thinks I'm not good enough for her.  I can't say anything about her b/c it's my girl's sister, but let's just say she has some issues she needs to deal with.  She seems like the type of person who can only be happy when everything is going the way she wants it...and we all know what this means....she's going to be 40 years old, miserable, and taking about 15 anti-depressant pills just to make it through the day, b/c NO ONE can have it their way all the time.  She's a fucking control-freak.    The whole situation is really sad, and if I didn't absolutely adore my girl, I would run like hell and never look back.  It's the kind of shit that makes you wanna drop bombs on people, but like I said...can't mess w/ the family.
Be very careful about what you say and do around the people you love (i.e. family), b/c you can never fully comprehend how much it can influence t
