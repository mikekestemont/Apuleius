of the rockets caught fire before they could be launched, he said, setting the van ablaze.  "After the incident, the car exploded," said an Iraqi police captain who spoke on condition of anonymity.  ...Earlier, insurgents using rockets also attacked the area near Marjam Hotel, which is also used by Westerners. One rocket struck a statue in nearby Wathik Square and another landed near the Indonesian Embassy, but did not explode, police said.    If I was only reading the headline, I would have thought something important had taken place. In reality, the situation was almost laughable, except for the poor guy whose leg was smashed during the incident.   The news only tells America about the terrible things that happen. Even worse, some of the things they broadcast aren't even that significant. Talk about media bias...
I can't wait to go home. The work day always seems longer than it is. Unfortunately for me, though I will not be working at my job this weekend, I still have a lot of work to do at home. Most of my work stems from my ethics class. Bah! I have a ton of stuff to read and a six page paper to write, a couple of chapters to read in my more-boring-than-dirt ethics book, and a quiz to study for. I have a paper to write for my short story class, as well. Thankfully, that paper will be much easier to write. On top of my school work, there are a few things (dishes, laundry) I need to do around the apartment. Yay Fridays!
I took a gamble yesterday and left my ethics class 2 hours early. There should be an extra credit question on the quiz that partains to what was discussed in class yesterday. I might not be able to answer it now, because I left early. We had a substitute and I didn't feel like staying the whole time. I told the substitute that I had to leave early. I didn't tell her that I'd go crazy if I didn't. The reason I had to leave early was to go get tickets for  urlLink  Spider-Man 2   (which was amazing, by the way. Better than the original) and to go eat dinner at my parent's house. It was my younger brother's 22nd birthday. All my brothers and sisters were there. It was the first time all five of us had been in the same room together for quite a while. It was fun.
I am soooo tired today. I don't have to work tomorrow, thankfully. I'll still have to get up early, though. I'm taking my wife to the airport in the morning at the crack of dawn. Man, that's going to suck. I'll have the apartment to myself for a whole five days. That'll be weird.
There is only one word that can describe  urlLink The Hives : pretentious. I saw them on Jay Leno last night. Hilarious.
Wow, I'm a slacker. I haven't posted anything for a bit.   I saw both  urlLink The Village  (freaky) and  urlLink Napoleon Dynamite  (hilarious) this weekend. Both were very g
