"They're so depressing going 'round and 'round Ooh, they make me dizzy, oh fast cars they run me down Fast cars, fast cars, Fast cars, I hate fast cars"  -The Buzzcocks, "Fast Cars"   Yeah, so Bike to Work Week (http://bike-to-work.com/) - May 17th - 21st.  All of you bastards should do this.  BTW I know that some of you may be critical of the fact that seem never to spend the time to hyperlink the links I put in my text, and well you can go to hell.  Furthermore you are the lazy bastards that I am targeting in my support of Bike to Work Week.  On that note I am hereby dedicate the 17th thru the 21st Don't Be a Lazy Bitch and Copy and Paste the Link if You Really Care That Much Week.  Yeah, and fuck you and your car.  Some kids pointed at me and laughed as I biked my way home yesterday, probally because of my shorts.  I don't wear the bike shorts (God-Help-Me!) but I was wearing my favorite Addidas soccer shorts, and for some reason, shorts just seem to illicit laughter in my direction. Perhaps school children are just incited to giggle at the sight of my shapely legs.  But no matter, they were waiting for a city bus.  Haha!  You have to ride a stinky bus, and take home a progress report for your mom to sign, and eat rectangular shaped pizza!  I almost gave them the finger, but then I thought better of giving 4th graders the finger so I quickly morphed my gesture into an ambivalent thumbs up.  I didn't want those kids to know they'd gotten inside my head.
It seems as if the powers that be may succeed in arresting my will to live today as I will shortly be instructed by Sergei (A Ukrainian, living in the Ukraine, with whom we communicate over the MSN instant messenger [one of the more garbled means of communication, second only to gibberish I suppose]) as to how to access and manage our SQL database.  If a database were a animal I imagine it would be a  Lamprey Eel.  The Lamprey Eel, for those of you unfamiliar with it:    "When attacking, the lamprey fastens onto its prey and rasps out a hole with its rough tongue."   - http://www.seagrant.wisc.edu/greatlakesfish/sealamprey.html   After which the eel sucks the guts and the very soul from it's prey.  That's kind of what the database does to me.  (sigh) I am a graphic designer, however my initial job description, and indeed my business cards read "Programmer."  (Fucking Hell!) So, some of these tedious programming duties still fall to me and my reluctant knack for techsavy.  But sweet reprieve! The Overlord, C.E.O., and all around master of large Chocolate Lab hounds has indicated that she would like us to leave early today if we so desire. I desire it so, and in 20 minutes or less I shall be speeding across the cityscape (sounds better than urban sprawlscape) on my shiny blue bicycle.  Happy d
