(which at the rate they are going, should be by the year 2020) this guy can say he has visited most of them. I sure am jealous. The atmosphere at one Starbucks is enough for me, let alone 5,000 of them. I'd take a double shot in the head before taking a double shot of latte at  EVERY  Starbucks. And am I the only one thinking "health-risk" with all the caffeine this guy is consuming?  Don't get me wrong, I like a Starbucks every once in a while. But its complete domination of the coffee market makes me wonder why someone has yet to raise an antitrust issue. I don't know if there'd be much to hang your hat on, but it's worth a shot, right? For the Coffee Drinkers Society of America?
For many states, today, July 1, is the effective date for  urlLink laws crafted during legislative sessions . In others, laws take effect January 1, or 90 days after passage.  The new laws will affect all aspects of life. From drugs to marriage to cell phones to pets. So, just as a friendly reminder, it may be wise to check into your new state laws. God forbid you use your cell phone while driving in DC or New Jersey and get stopped for it (yep, no using cell phones!)  So be cautious! You never know. You may be performing an illegal act without knowing it. And if you are in Colorado, keep your dog on a leash. Colorado now requires microchips to be implanted in dogs that bite people, so they can be tracked. . .
This time, she's marrying for love, Britney Spears said of her recent engagement to dancer Kevin Federline.  Spears, 22, and Federline, 26, began dating a few months ago, after her Las Vegas wedding to childhood friend Jason Alexander in January. That marriage was annulled 55 hours later.  Of the quickie Vegas ceremony, "That thing was a total ugh," she says. "I was not in love at all."  This is different, says Spears, who's wearing a five-carat diamond set atop two slender platinum, diamond-encrusted bands on her left finger.  Federline popped the question on an airplane while flying with Spears from Ireland to New York after the European leg of her tour. "I'd known for a while that she's the one," he says.  Federline, who performed as a backup dancer for Justin Timberlake, Spears' former boyfriend, previously was involved with Shar Jackson, star of TV's "Moesha." They have a 2-year-old daughter and are expecting another baby.  Does anyone else see anything wrong with this picture? She's on her second marriage in a matter of months and this time she's in love? Maybe she's in love with that 5-carat diamond. And this guy already has one kid and now has another on the way? WTF?  On another note, I heard from some news source that Britney actually proposed to this guy. And apparently he balked at first. Are you kidding?   Something's wrong with Britney these days and I'm just not sure what it is. . .
