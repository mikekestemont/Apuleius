This email came to us yesterday at East Branch:   From Maria Redburn  Subject: Shirley Hinton banned from Phone use  Ms. Hinton is an older woman with white hair.  She has been using our phone to call social security.  Yesterday she had a 40 minute phone call and came back for another 20 minutes.    I've seen this lady before. She has crazy hair; I mean, we're talking Don King here. The first time I ever saw her, she came to use our phone to report a crime. She called IPD to report that some lady was selling prescription pharmaceuticals, except it was over in Garland, according to her story. So they told her to call the Garland PD. She did that and spent about thirty minutes trying to explain herself, which involved a lot of speaking very loudly and repeating herself. I thought we should have banned her from the phone before she ever got on, based solely on her smell, but hey, it's not my decision. This last time, she didn't even ask, she pulled over Janis' chair and sat down behind to use our phone, which happened to be behind our counter.

Since the two things that dominate my thoughts the most are sex and politics, I began to wonder if anyone had ever written any slash-fiction between political figures. Sure, enough I did manage to find one guy. Unfortunately (or not for you guys), it's all gay. Here's  urlLink Blair/Brown  and  urlLink Bush/Chirac . There's more listed  urlLink here , but no links, so you'll have to make do with those.
If you read my comment on the last post, and wondered, "what in this sick world could Brainerd Diarrhea be?" then I have your  urlLink answer.
urlLink    This comic is not a collector's item   Or rather, I have had some passing but nasty affairs with comics in my youth. Now, I happen to like comics a lot. No, they're not great literature. No, they don't make for the most challenging of reading. And no, calling yourself a "collector" doesn't allow you to escape the shame that you should feel at reading comics as an adult. However, I for one have never loved comics so much that I thought I should try my hand at writing one, or even  urlLink publishing it online . This gentleman's comic is less like the Sunday comic or the super-hero comic, and more like the comics they hide deep in the Dallas Observer...only not as good. But please browse his site and read a few. They may grow on you.
urlLink    What caused someone to look at this picture and think, "It would be funny if we painted her green and called her Shrek's mom?"  Would this classfy as "dumps like a t
