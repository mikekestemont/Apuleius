finished. Can't think of anything else important concerning me.    urlLink Wes  gets his wisdom teeth pulled today. It would be fun to mess with him while he's on the goofy gas.   Tomorrow is  urlLink Kasey's  birthday. Everyone wish him Happy Birthday.
Last Tuesday's show was all too wonderful. People were dedicating their lives to Christ. What more could one ask for? I was happy that Jesus let me experience that. I've never been in the middle of something like that before.  Everyone from the Wonder Tour & the Cameron people were so awesome. Thanks to each and every one of you.  And here's some shoutouts. Thanks to Jamie, Heather, Rachel, Haley, Jon, Aimee &amp; anyone else from the Ft. Smith area (sorry I can't remember all your names.) It was really cool to see you guys there. I didn't see most of you after the show so I hope you got to stay. Sorry it took so long, the wait was definitely for a good cause.  Back to the show. We played last and the kids were ready for some rock. They were throwing beach balls everywhere; must have been about 25 of those things. It was like a Spring Break show on tv except it was all for Jesus. We ended our set w/ Light of the World (Here I Am to Worship), and everyone joined in to worship with us. Again, what more could I ask for to be used in such a way.  Here's the kicker. They had a portable toilet inside a chuck wagon. You might think that alone is awesome. Well.....it was flushable too! That thing is definitely in my Top 10 most interesting bathroom list.
Wow, there was quite a few folks at the Music Hall last night. My apologies for the $8 cover, that's the standard fee there I guess. I feel that it is quite a bit high for local type acts considering the facilities themselves too.   Thanks to everyone who came, especially to those who helped with merch, drove for a while to get there, and/or brought someone with them. I hope we were encouraging and entertaining at the same time.   I danced a little in the pit and did my helmet routine. Hopefully Brian will be able to take over in the future. The pit takes more energy than I have.   Someone set a smoke bomb off in front of my car and then everyone was like, "your car is on fire!" and I freaked for a second or two. It was a good joke, although I don't think the person that set it off even meant it to be a joke on me or my car.   PM Today and Hold Your Own were both great. Hadn't seen either one of them before. I think The Wedding amazed at their transformation from the last months of recording and being in Nashville. I like watching Kevin hang off the ceiling and do the backwards jump/fall into the crowd. If they keep that up everyone will love them when they embark on this upcoming t
