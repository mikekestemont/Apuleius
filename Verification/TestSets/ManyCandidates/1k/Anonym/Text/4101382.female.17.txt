Well for those who don't know the story of the seperated twins that found each other at HyVee... Here it is.... A long long time ago, about 17.5 years ago, there was this lady that was giving birth... she was supposed to give birth to siamese twins.  She started on November 8th, and she had the first one, but there were complications so they had to detatch the first born from the other, supposedly the second baby wasn't fully developed.  So about May the she went into labor with the second child.  Because of complications during the labor the mother had to have a sesarian section (sea section for those who don't know) and didn't make it through the birth of her second siamese twin.  So the doctors and hospital staff thought it would be a generous thing to give the twins to families who had still births.  The first named Lacey was giving to Mr. and Mrs. Dubbe and the second named Bethany was giving to Mr. and Mrs. Bawdon.  Seventeen years later the twins found each other at HyVee were they both worked.  They both had scars on there hands so they figured that they were connected at the hand.   The End.
For those of you who don't know what movie my title came from, I have one thing to say to you... Get with it!!   The reason for the title was because at work today (wow a hole 8 hours) I had to check beer and after I made the list, I was back looking for it in the back room and well there wasn't much there.  I was working on it for about 3 hours (yes that is a long time... no thanks to Aaron...grrrrr.)and finally about 1.5 hours in to it, Lacey came back to help me (thanks lacey) and she was helping me finish the displays.  We got to the Coors display and there wasn't any.. so Lacey asks "Why is all the Rum gone?"  That really brightened my day... I don't know why but it did.    I found out today when I got off work that Jacob can't go with me to the Beach Boys concert.  However Geoff said that he might go with me if he can get out of what he is doing.  Pauly, if you don't have to work you can go with me  :P.. j/k, you wouldn't have fun.  Plus you will probably blow all your money at the Trapped concert (I am still mad at you for that, I want to go but can't).   Until Next time... Ta T
