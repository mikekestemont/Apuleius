what they thought *they* wanted to do, and all ready to start their legal careers.  But I thought... I thought this was school school, not vocational school.  I was ready to read.  Not so eager to write cover letters.  IV. And so here is where I finally get to making the point I should have just started the whole post with.  Before you go to law school, understand: law school, much more than I expected, is trade school.  The legal world that we're presented with has two categories: law firms, and public interest jobs.  Later on, you discover there are also clerkships (working for judges), which can lead to academia (teaching), but just as often lead right back to firms or public interest.  If these are not the careers you want to pursue, you will be swimming against a very strong current -- a current that can take hold of your body and carry it along, even if you started out intending to swim in a different direction.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, but I truly believe the current changes people's destinations quite often.  It is very easy to go through the recruiting process and end up at a law firm.  Easy enough that you can do it without much effort or thinking, and in fact if you don't expend much effort or thinking, that's probably exactly what will happen.  V. The problem, I think, is that law school forces you to make these choices pretty early on, and without much background.  I didn't know what a law firm did until I worked at one this summer.  And I'm still not entirely sure what people do at public interest organizations.  And as far as what other lawyers do?  Not much of a clue.  Because they don't come and recruit.  I mean, the same thing sort of happens in undergrad, when consulting firms and investment banks are the only people who come to recruit, and you start to feel like those are the only options out there.  When there are surely a gazillion more jobs -- but they don't need to come and recruit because they have enough people coming to find them, or they're smaller and don't need entering classes of 50 people and so it doesn't make any sense to go to college campuses.  Same thing with law school.  The [fill in whatever law job I'm unaware of] doesn't need to come recruit because (1) they're not looking for people with no experience, (2) people find them, and (3) it makes no economic sense to come and recruit.  But because the firms do come to campus, the whole law school experience ends up tailored around sending us there -- the recruiting season, interviews, career panels, etc.  VI.  The next logical step in this piece would be to tell you what exactly law firms and public interest organizations do, at least as far as I know, in case you don't, and you want to go to law school.  So I'll call that part 2 and write it tomorrow.  :
