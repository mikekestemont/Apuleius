hours of sleep is the right amount for me? Four is too little, and anything more than that (if it's less than about ten) is too much? Hmm...makes you wonder.  I just finished watching the TTT EE Cast Commentary. I can't believe I haven't listened to it before now! It's very interesting throughout. Bernard Hill, Brad Dourif, and of course Dom and Billy were the best though. Sean Astin was a bit annoying, but that's nothing unusual.  Now I really need to go do some reading or writing. Or maybe I'll take a nap. Whatever :)        I AM 20% WHITE TRASH!
Ouch. :'(
Why is it that I only have dreams when I get just enough sleep? Never when I go for one of those 12-hour naps, and never when I don't get more than three hours. *sigh* Anyway, last night I dreamed that a bunch of people I didn't know, Eddie and I were all on the run, in Tiffany's car, because Eddie had seen a mob guy kill someone. This was a very strange dream, but pretty fun, because most of the time we were sitting around in this "safe house" ducking from windows. And then, of course, the alarm had to go off.  I am typing this when I should be fixing breakfast to get me through another day of band camp. Sarah, I will mail your Guns 'n' Roses CD tomorrow. Will that make you feel better?
99 degrees Farenheit. Not a cloud in the sky. Marching. Trying to earn the respect of underclassmen while simultaneously earn the respect of a new band director. 'Nuff said.  I am tired. Plus, I am very very mad because they're showing 'The River Wild' on abc family instead of 'Whose Line Is It Anyway?'. How dare they! So I have no excuse for not working on 'Portrait of a Lady'. Not to mention Calculus worksheets and BNW:R.  Band Camp at 8:00 AM again tomorrow. :( BUT I get to leave early! Yay! Except it's only to go to work. Boo.  I had trouble sleeping last night because I couldn't stop worrying about how much stuff I'm going to have to do for school this year. I've bitten off WAY more than I may be able to chew. This does not bode well for senior year! :'(
There are few things in this world sexier than Antonio Banderas as Zorro. Unfortunately, the sequel isn't due out till sometime in 2005. Rats. I'll just have to content myself with reruns of 'Whose Line Is It Anyway?', which is a great show.  Today I painted a tree on the wall at BGS. It was quite fun, and I think it looks really good. Afterwards, Dad and I went to Lyons to see Grandma and Grandpa. Had a really good pecan praline parfait at DQ. Yum!  Other than the tree, I haven't accomplished anything all night. Alas, I should be reading Portrait of a Lady or BNW: Revisited. Oh, well.  Maybe I'll have something interesting to write about after band camp tomorrow.
