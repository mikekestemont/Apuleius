downtown and have a drink on a patio.  but we're both pretty fucking poor, so maybe we'll just, uh, what the heck else is there to do? lol anyway, tis all.  until next time.
my parents took me out for my birthday dinner last night.. we went to the keg and it was oh so tasty. funny thing is, we all ordered chicken. so then my friends were going out to the phoenix.  not surprising since that is where we always go.  i wasn't going to go because i was in a foul mood, but i decided to go anyway.  it took us 1.5 hours to get into toronto, and it usually only takes about 25 minutes.  its caribana, so roads were closed and traffic sucked. so we finally get there (me ana and mike were meeting darin, jeff and matty), and they won't let me in because i was wearing thong sandals.  keep in mind its now 1am.  but, being caribana weekend, stores were open late. so we ran over to yonge st, found an open store that sold shoes, and i bought a pair of neon green sneakers.  i looked hot. they matched so very well with my white skirt and white shirt.  let me tell you.  so i was finally allowed into the bar.  after all of that. sheesh.  then, for whatever reason, i kept the lime green shoes on for the rest of the night, which was pretty stupid considering i had my white flip-flops in my purse. duh. only just as we were leaving did i realize i could change my shoes. anyway the phoenix was a good time.  jeff and darin were macking the ladies like nobodies business.  matty was super po'd because some idiot drunk girl smacked his beer bottle, spilling beer all over him, which wasn't very nice.  i was going to get a ride home with ana and mike (the boys were all staying at deeg's) but i went back to deeg's and got a ride back with jeff this morning.  the last few times i've gone out with matty i've spent the night at his place - NO HANKY-PANKY - just go back there to smoke some wacky tabacky  (although no one believes me - I SWEAR ITS THE TRUTHH!!).. and this time i brought some of my own, so i figured i'd go back there and repay the favours.. i like matty so much.. i think he's one of the coolest/nicest/smartest people i've met in a long time. i wanted to ask him for his number to hang out with him again (he's more of a friend of a friend - so i only see him when everyone goes out - but we usually spend the night talking to each other) but i didn't want him to think i was hitting on him.  maybe i'll email him. cause really, he's super cool. anyway, i'm just waiting until i pick up my mom from toronto, then i'm going to meet the gang on a patio somewhere in 'sauga..  yay for the s
