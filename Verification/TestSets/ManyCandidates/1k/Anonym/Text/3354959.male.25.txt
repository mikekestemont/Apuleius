rapids, the highest you're allowed to go through. Boo-ya.  -I kicked Kia's ass at Monopoly. I don't think she has the killer instinct to win the game. I kept piling on the houses and hotels, but she just wanted to keep what she had so I wouldn't lose any money. Very sweet of her. I put some hotels on Boardwalk and Park Place. She didn't last long.  -Golf. I played with my dad for the first time in 2 years. Surprisingly, I was not as bad as I could have been. I had 4 pars. I was relatively pleased. For 9 holes, we played with a local kid, maybe 17 years old, who was a member there and gave us all the tips for how to play the holes. He told us that one summer he played 54 holes a day (fifty-four), three or four days a week. If you're going fast, and I mean whipping through the course, you can do 18 holes in 4 hours. 54 holes would take you 12 hours, minimum. That's sunup to sundown, 3-4 days a week. Badass.  -Mini golf. I lost. To everyone. I demand a rematch.  -The house we stayed in had a huge cutout of a parrot on the wall and said "Parrot Fever". I'm not even going to venture a guess about that one.  -During the trip, Kia and I frequented as many Dunkin' Donuts as was humanly possible, given that there are none in St. Louis, which I think is absurd. It did make for an interesting diet, though, trying to stuff all of those donuts and coffee into yourself as often as you could.  -Speaking of diet, I also ate clam chowda at every meal out. I counted at least four different restaurants where I had it. And they were four different chowdas. Not one the same as any others. Fascinating.  -Oh, the title of this post: We got out of town just in the nick of time to miss all of the Democratic National Convention craziness. Apparently, the city was pretty quiet the whole week. I guess everyone else had the same idea as we did.
American Idol auditions are happening here in St. Louis this weekend. This is my chance....to make a complete ass of myself on TV. I've always wanted to do that. Seriously, the only people who get on, of the thousands who show up and wait in line, are the ones who are kickass good or who are laugh-out-loud awful. I guess I'll have to try and be laugh-out-loud awful. Does anybody have the words to "Wind Beneath My Wings"?
urlLink A little site  that lets you play the Kevin Bacon game, only with bands. (Note: Bands limited. They're listed at the bottom).
Catching up on the convention after being away, I found this quote from Al Gore:  "I'll be candid with you. I had hoped to be back here this week under different circumstances, running for re-election. But you know the old saying: you win some, you lose some. And then there's that little-known third c
