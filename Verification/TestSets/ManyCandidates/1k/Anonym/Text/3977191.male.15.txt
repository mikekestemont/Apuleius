Here's the First Song, I'm gonna try to get a few up a week untill I get my music folder empties.  Might take a few years.    "Thinking Of You"            When All alone,  Thinking of you.  You drive me Crazy,   thinking of you.  I try to shift my mind, but it always ends the same,  Thinking of you.  Thinking of you.    Get outta my head,  (So many thing I should have said)  Havent Seen you in months,  (Should have taken the chance I had)  You are the reason why, I can't stay with a girl,  You are the one I need,  That girl with it all.    You messed me up for good.  When ever I see a date I see you.  I freak,   I mess,   I sigh,  I cry.    I wish I could rewind when we were so close,   Always holding hands, following each other to where we go.  But then we drifted gtudually,  made new Friends.  I regret it more than ever,   So much left unsaid.    I've had your phone Number for months.  Do you Remember?  If I called I don't know what to say,   what to do,  How to react,   How to live.  How to go on another day with out you,   I dreamabout the day when you're by my side, again,  Even if we're just friends!    I need you!  (When All alone.)  I miss you so Damn Much!  (Thinking of you.)  I can't take it!  (You drive me Crazy,)   (thinking of you.)  Come back within my grasp!  (I try to shift my mind, but it always ends the same,)  (Thinking of you, again, for thousandth time in a while,)      Thinking of you.                 Thinking of you.  ---------------------------------------    I think  That is honestly the only song I have ever written that I can read back and not have to go "What the fuck?"    Keep stopping in
