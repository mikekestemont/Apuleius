to be loyal, and honourable to be valorous.  the people always tell you, that friendship is forever, that foes must be friends, that peace is pacific.  those same fine people, will just as soon turn around, at the suggestion of their doing, the very same that which they commended.  the same people that populate, every city on this clump, of dirt and grime and water, hurtling through a vast vacuum.  and they are the hypocrites, who would sooner slaughter the child, of another, because their own is dead, and the envy of it stinks.  and they are wanting, like eager predators of the wild, to push their archaic, outdated legalisms on those undeserving.  but then, i speak only truth, and truth appears to be untruth, if you should be opposed to it.
in awe of characters i'd seen in awe of places they'd been in awe of all in between;  the people who populate your landscape, all seem to be curst by two heads. two minds, two hearts: two states of being alive, and yet so dead.  Old Harry is in dilemma, what to do about Pete Parker; To vanquish or to cherish? why does the man seem squarish?  Peter is in tatters, as he begins to lose his powers; Shall he lose or gain the lady? Shall he heroic be, or cowardly?  Then come us to the damsel, whose face shall make the show sell. She finds love from the moon, and much in a swoon, jilts the silly goon, all for the spider's boon.
my road is the ground beneath by feet. the vast expanse where horizons meet.     when i am lost, i scarce admit defeat. i onwards march and follow the feet.
i recall her fingers oily as she smiled and looked coyly  the effortlessness of the glide as the fingers, tense, slide  exploring nooks and hollows imaginary lines are followed.  the kneading of my sinews the feeling of being renewed.
last blog didnt work... pity. that was a nice poem i wrote. "Money is King".  Let's see if this blog entry gets published.
money rules us all and causes some to fall  money plants the sin and sends you to the bin  money lifts you up and buys you food to sup  money greases palms if you should have no qualms  money is pithy it's pure security  money is king when you say it, you can sing...  MONEY!!!
while alice is stuck in wonderland kevin is lost in blunder land. what's that you say? "Hey -- bummer, man." like a racer negotiating the stunner bend i keep hoping that this wont get out of hand. that luck keeps shifting like only it can, that eventually i'll drift to the subtler blend. is it time now? to drop pretense? to surrender and give in without defense? i hope it turns out, i'll be a better man; even though i think about it now and then... the things that people don't understand, the things that happened that were never planned. perhaps now, it's time, to keep it canned; perhaps i will exhaust your attention s
