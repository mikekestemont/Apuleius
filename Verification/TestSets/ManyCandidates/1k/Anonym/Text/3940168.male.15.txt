. .    I burped today while eating and my father went crazy on me cus i opened my mouth to burp and he told me to say exscuse me and well i dont talk while my mouth is open and he flipped out cus i didnt. Man then when i raised my voice he threatened to beat my head in. Yeah he pisses me off sometime but when i think about it i raise my voice alot . . . thats one of my flaws . . .   Not that i have no life or anything but i was researching some future college choices and there are some close in illionois ... and georgia. Then there always is Japan. . . the place that has kept my interest for many many years. I want to be taught there like most animators.

I am a young kid . . . i might never amount to nothing but that wont stop me from trying. I wish to be an animator , something that seems so hard i will acomplish if i can. But, if i fail then all these hopes scribbles ambitions i have will fall with me into a vast nothingness. Yeah i am young thats what i keep saying when i fall into sleep . . . well im not and its about time i stop scribling and really fucking try to create something worth making . . . so i have started invested in animating materials and sorts. I just wish that time would slow down cus . . . i have 4 years of regular school ahead of me befor i have to go through college and i am damned if i dont make it that far . . .   So hear i sit on the computer sorrounded by many drawings and other shit that clutters here. I slouch sitting here in a mess. I have a "great" imagination many people say . . . but when it comes to actually creating something in anime form my brain just dies. A young kid i am . . . thats life will change dramatically in the next four years. Scribbles that could make or break me . . . i have never had good luck . . . what will the consequences be of failing in this anime career , i mean if i fail it will be four fucking years down the drain . . . well life will change this little boy for better or worse . . .
