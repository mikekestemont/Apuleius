God for summer vacation.  My only plans for tomorrow are to "maybe" go see a movie.  They are changing to "definitely" taking a nap...  I had a delightful encounter with someone I met in a chat room tonight.  This person - I'll call him Kaspar - was caring and helpful and talked with me about some issues I hadn't talked about with anyone, but sorely needed to.  I deeply appreciated his advice.  It makes me miss having the males friends who have come and gone out of my life.  I haven't had any "man friend" to talk to since Mark drifted out of my like a few years ago.  I really value the advice that Kaspar gave me.  I will keep sending good thoughts his way.  I always marvel that the Internet provides a way for people who would otherwise never have met to connect with one another.  It's nice not to feel alone in this world.
I have not written on my blog since my trip away with the girls.  We has a most excellent time - much shopping, laughing and eating.  Our biggest hoot came from finding the porn that driver's husband obviously keeps in their conversion van.  Although we didn't watch it, I'm sure the film  Black Pepper  will turn out to be a cinematic classic.

The highlight of the week is the fact that my summer reality TV shows started on Tuesday.  Amazing Race and Big Brother both premiering on one night!  I was in heaven.  Thank God for the invention of TiVo.  I can get through my shows in a timely fashion and not have to watch the annoying commercials.    I know some people look down on me for the vast amount of TV that I watch.  I used to feel bad about this until I examined my life compared to others.  One, I read more than most people I know, so it's not like I don't do things to improve my mind.  Two, I consider myself a student of popular culture - I know what's going on in the world of entertainment, and I think that helps me related to MY students better.  In fact, I don't think that, I KNOW it.  Three, people who pride themselves on not watching TV often don't spend much time doing much else, because they are slow about doing everything.  I am generally multi-tasking while watching TV.  I can think of a friend that I have who doesn't watch TV, doesn't really read, doesn't do any volunteer work, he does go to many movies, but I would just like to know what else fills up his time? Maybe I don't want to k
