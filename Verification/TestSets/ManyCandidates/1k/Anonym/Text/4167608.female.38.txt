we save a diaper this way, her outfit gets soaked because it's on the counter next to her.  I mentally note that we have only one more change of clothes for her.  Three hours to go.  I get back to the seat, K wakes up (fortunately she'd gone back to sleep shortly after take off) and poops.  Kevin goes to change her.  The people on the plane must be getting tired of us going up and down the aisle every 13.5 minutes.  Or else they find it entertaining to count the times we do.  Many sympathetic smiles, not too many glares or heavy sighs.  Kevin needs a new outfit for K.  I send C back with one, (what a good kid).  I just want to sit for a minute.  I feed K, (thank goodness I am nursing her and don't have to mess around with bottles and formula) burp her, get her back in her carseat.  She seems to be ready to go back to sleep.  O on the other hand, does NOT.  She shrieks.  She yells, she cries.  She flops around, in every position imaginable, trying to get comfortable.   It was around then that I looked around at the heads and faces around me and realized that I did not care, not even one WHIT, what  anyone  on that plane thought about us.  As I listened to K grunt and begin pooping again, I start to laugh.  Hysterically. Out loud.  And the pilot tells us we are passing over Saskatchewan...  Somehow, the rest of the flight passes.  O does, eventually, fall asleep in my arms (for about an hour) after singing the I Love You song 30 times in her ear as she shrieked and flopped her way into a somewhat comfortable (for HER) position.  My butt goes to sleep, my arm does too.  Kevin paced around the plane for about an hour with K after getting her diaper changed again until she fell back to sleep.  We got in to Vancouver with one diaper left for O and no changes of clothes.  We get our luggage and picked up our van.  We drive home.  Everyone was happy to be off the plane and going home.  Having never had the opportunity to eat our subs, we are nearly starving.  We will grab some quick take out when we get home.  The subs are squashed and not very appealing sounding now.  We wonder how the animals are doing, whether our good friend M had any troubles or not.  We pull up to the house, only to see M's car in the drive.  Kevin goes in ahead to say hi and see how things are going.  As I'm unloading babies and bags he comes back out to tell me that M is on the floor in our bedroom passed out.  He thinks we should call 911...   Turns out she had sun/heat stroke.  She is fine now, after a trip to the hospital in an ambulance and about a gallon of fluid pumped into her.   And so, we are home.  Everyone survived.  B
