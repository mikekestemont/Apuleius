end...so go grab it...  Even with all these great things...my situation of my handbook still haven't changed...uptill this point no one is able to give me something decent for the cover...Time is running out (since the deadline is the 14h) I can only wait one more day...if still nothing good, than I'll have to make it...err...I really don't want to go there...-_-  The weather here in Toronto have been very cool...unlike the last couple of years when it's suppose to be 30+....but this year in the middle of August is surprisingly...very nice & cool, I almost have no use for my AC in my room anymore, but I'm going to keep it anyways...just in case... ;)  All in all....it have been a good day...just wish someone would give me a decent cover page...oh well...nothing I can do...

Nothing have been going right today...when I work up this morning...to my complet surprise, I realise that I have no water and I didn't wake up early enough to save some water to use for the rest of the day...-_-...lucky me...  And if that is not the only thing that is not going well...the Handbook I'm working on for my Church's Summer camp is in desperate need of a cover page, and it almost seems that no one in my church or my handbook team have any artistic skills whatsoever...what does that boil down to? I need to ride shotgun and make my own cover, and if I ineed need to...it will not be pretty...oh boy, this will really make my day...  And what is even more depressing is that I just realized today what many doesn't want to...My summer is half shot!!...only a few more week until I need to sit back down into that classroom and well...learn and achieve...as much as I like reading and writing and other "eductaional" stuff, school is not on my favourt list...(well, not any more)...  Well...what am I going to do with all these stuff?...I guess I can only do them, forget about them and hope for the best...oh well...let's hope the situation changes in the next 24 hours...  Till than...  "You don't know what it is, but it's there...it's like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad" -- Morpheus  Neo...
Well Well Well.....finally...my own mind blog...I always wanted to do something like this...but never got around to it...I think this is a great tool to write down how I feel, opinions and...who knows what might come across my way...  Some happy news today I guess...my English youth pastor got engaged today to one of my friend, really happy for them both...but right after the good news...more responsibilitys, more things need to be completed for the hand book and my GM position...things are going well I guess, since I am on my summer vacation, there is much time to relax and rest. But a bit of work is always needed just to keep me away from brain dead state. ;)...well.....nothing much to add...but I am really enjoying this, hope this will l
