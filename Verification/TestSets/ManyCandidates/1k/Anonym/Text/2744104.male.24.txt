say that none have before or will after?  I guess I shall write (or blog), for as John Cheever so elegantly put it: " The need to write comes from the need to make sense of one's life and discover one's usefulness. " I guess in the process I will come out with some posts to keep Ankur "interested".  Regards Raju
Well, I can't hold back the ecstatic feeling of sweat running down my back (for that matter, the entire body), the inexplicable soothness of cold breeze on my sweat-soaked face... Pardon me for the following outburst, for it is neither as interesting as  urlLink Prince Saleem 's outings nor as grandiose as  urlLink Mr. Saxena 's Europe trips... But if I still sound pompous and grandiloquent, blame it on the rarity (till now) of the incident...  Ever since my back forced me out of major physical activity, I have been looking forward to this day... To feel the blissful feelings only sport(s) can provide...  Anyway, I have this stupid knack, which I don't think anybody of you has realised so far, of starting things off at mathematically pleasing units of time e.g. starting work at 11:00:00 am, even if it's just 10:01:00 am and I have nothing else to do... I have been doing it for as long as I remember... It is a wonderful tool of laziness, without the usual pangs of conscience... You should try it sometime... So, I had planned on getting back to some physical activity and starting a new chapter in my life on June 1st 2004... Although, I failed to keep my date with history, I have finally done it today...  I woke up at 6:15 in the morning and ran around the campus (Cross Country minus the SAC rounds) WITHOUT A SINGLE HALT, but at a much slower pace than my youthful days... The campus looks amazing in the morning and it was eerily deserted today... I wish I could say the lakeside looked amazing, but the waterline had receded so far back that I couldn't even tell if a lake exists there anymore...  Stopped at the SAC grounds and lay in the center of the field for a while and savoured the smell and feel of dew soaked grass, something I'll always associate with Inter IIT... and lots of fun... And at that moment, it hit me hard and the feeling's finally starting to sink in... That I am no longer going to be able to do things I have come to love...  Anyway, I'll save the nostalgic feelings for another day, another post.  All this fuss for a morning run, you may say!? But I needed it desperately to get back to fitness and also do something about the "bun in the oven"(Hint 1: Kill Bill 2, Hint 2: Belly)... I hope to continue doing so for some time to come...  Coffee treat to everyone who manages to get to Coffee Shack by 9 AM!  Regards, An ecstatic Raju  PS: Nidhi, I am choking to death. I haven't used a single s
