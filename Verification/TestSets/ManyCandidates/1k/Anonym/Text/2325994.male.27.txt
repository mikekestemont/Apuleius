charger back in the office. You cannot deliver before time.  The phone rings. Its the one you have been waiting for. You clear your throat and say hello. You notice that the voice on the other side is a happy one. Platitudes and pleasantries follow. And then your manager tells you. Souvik, you have been a remarkable asset to the team and the organization in general. You have been proactive, versatile. You have sought out opportunities and converted them. Your value additions have been a fair number and consistent, Souvik, you this....you that. Its coming, you think, & press the phone closer to your ear. And then it comes.
