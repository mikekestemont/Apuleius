muscles ache all over my body, I’m bruised in several places, exhausted and sunburned!  And I feel GREAT!!!  Opening weekend at the  urlLink  faire   was a huge success!  We opened to record breaking crowds in perfect weather.  I always feel like I’m cheating my first audiences, as I know how much room for growth I have, but they really did enjoy themselves.    Some of my favorite moments this past weekend:  The Knighting Ceremony!  As the Jester, I get there early to prepare the little ones for meeting the Queen, and give them ideas to tell her why they should be Knights.  When she arrived, there were about fifty something kids all perfectly rowed bowing before her.  My chessboard fight was a huge success, as was Much Ado about Nothing!  Joey Giambattista, who plays  urlLink Will Scarlet  , and I worked out a fight and then improvised a scene around it before the Final Joust.  The Jester runs up to Will Scarlet and says he wants to be one of  urlLink Robin Hood’s Merry Men!  Will says that he must be tough and fight with a signature weapon.  The Jester then fights with his homunculus against Will with his daggers, and of course loses and starts crying.  Will feels bad and gives the Jester a hug and says he can be in the band anyway!  They then come upon  urlLink Little John   and do a slow motion replay of the fight they just did.  When they finish, Little John, played by Steve Kraus, says, “Alright, now let’s see it in reverse!”  I looked at him, totally dumbfounded, but we did it!  The audience was completely delighted!  Watching Nick Freeley, at 17 years old, Joust with amazing skill and grace!  Truly awe inspiring!  Well, I am totally exhausted now; my faire day is a real marathon.  Sometimes I am found sprinting from one set to another.  If I’m not in shape now, I will be by end of summer!       Nick's first joust last year

This being my third season at the faire, it occurs to me how much I truly love the people I am working with.  They are more than just colleagues, they are family. I am grateful and proud to be among them.  Now that the long and tiring rehearsal process is just about complete, I look forward to letting go and having fun!
