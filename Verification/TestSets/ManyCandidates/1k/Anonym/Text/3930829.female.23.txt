 So much crap happens in a day and at the end of it when I'm left standing I just feel like saying Thank You and yet, I'm not quite sure where it should be directed.  To some black void in the sky?   To God, to the earth, to the guy that scans my groceries...?  For tonight I'll send it out into the endless labrynth of the internet, and let it fall upon anyone that crosses paths with my blog :)  Thank You.  And Goodnight.
I decided we should go on a vacation.  Now that I have plenty of time to sit at my desk and work and plan things, I religiously open up my planner and attempt to plan out all my time off.  For our next vacation we considered going to Florida but we were just there for our honeymoon and I've never been to Florida without being in Disney World so I really don't want to ruin the magic for myself!  (Yes, I know I'm a dork) We both really want to go to Vegas but to do it the way we want requires us to put it off till next year.  We then considered Atlantic City but were told by multiple people that it's ghetto so that is out.  My mom suggested this gorgeous place in Saratoga called the Sagamore but that's more of a spa get-away which only really appeals to one of us...so I guess we'll wait 'till next year and go to Vegas.  Enough of that mumbo-jumbo.  It's been a nice weekend.  We saw the Village.  For Erik it was a let down but for me it was a pleasant surprise.  I completely bought into the marketing scheme but was actually quite intrigued with the moral conflicts!   My first fondant birthday cake was a success.  I do so love to bake!  Kendra's surprise party was today and then we all played poker.  Boze's parties are always a pleasure.  Always a lot of people  and a lot of fun, people never want to leave and end up staying for like 12 hours.  That's one thing I'll miss about Newport.  We've had some fun parties here, despite any parking difficulties.  It was always fun to go down to Via Via at 1:45am and see the amazing spectacle of skanks and drunks parading around, basking in their own stupidity.  I'll never forget when me, Susan, Jim, Olaf and I think someone else was there on our roof talking to the people walking by.  Especially when we got the brody pony girls to eat that guy's pizza while he went to take a piss in the parking lot.  But our parties will be even better now that we'll live in Dartmouth and everyone lives within a 5 mile radius!  My first few weddings are booked.  It would be nice to get to the point where all I do is my photography but until then, work drags on.  Hey, at least I get my own holiday.  Administrative Assistant's Day is April 27th!  Beat that!  Thanks for tuning into my weekend u
