but everyone was gonna go anyway since nsg had pulled outta the comp. so everything was fixed. i was in a team, as was everyone else. we were about to leave when podmore gets a call from the nsg co-ordinator saying that they were still entering their team *kiz must be happy bout that* so then we had to scrap team B all together which is really slack. so now we have five people on team A + two yr 9 spectators. its really stupid cos now jono, weller and jack cant come T__T so now it has been confirmed that team A consists of:  me, bibhu, adro, koziol and alastair . the debate is tomorrow and i am grateful that i'm not in the first round --- i can spend some time doing maths... but i won't be at school tomoz...w00t!      we also had english off today cos we were gonna 'prep' for tomoz' debating. i really can't be bothered talking about it but the keywords include: edward davison, sexually connotated converstations, lack of preparation and laughter *when ed  fell off his chair  like 3 times -_-''*      i must leave this blog now as i need to do maths and then do a little bit of debating research -_+
Damn ye social sciences, why must thou taunt me so? I am so seriously hating history and geography right now. I've just finished my geo assignment and now have to complete a 2 page essay on women's role and attitude changes during and after WWII and it's actually worth  something like 10 percent of something or other.  AAARRGGGHHH!!! Plus and english speech. DOUBLE AAARRGGGHHH!!! Thanks Yi Long for helping me with the geo, you're the best.
i'm feeling empty  - i'm missing something. *sigh* i'm also feeling regretful for all those life changing mistakes. it's so hard to forget mistakes when they turn your life upside down. once again, i put forward the question, 'why can't we turn back time and correct our mistakes?' year 10 so far has been the most eventful year in terms of life changing mistakes. and i hate it so much... why can't everything stay the same ?   i miss the happy times... on the outside we say that we've forgiven...yet deep down we know that it will never be the same...      ok. enough of going all weird.  celebration! 2000 ppl  have visited our blog in less than a month! yipee! rite...i'll stop that now too...      haven't done much since the last time i blogged. last night we booked a table at  sushi suma  at surry hills but when we left chatswood, the harbour bridge was bloody packed?!?!?! wat the...? so we ended up driving around for ages and eventually ended up at neutral bay and went to some jap restaurant called  ponto-cho . it was really nice ^___^ i had this whole bowl of salmon roe...yum... it was ok price...i was so full afterwards...mm...      *too much h/w for cskool* doesn't the teacher realise that no one will do it?! far out...kevin -- where were you eh?!? g
