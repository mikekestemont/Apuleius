greatest hit album is a safe bet) and Tracy Chapman's  urlLink Collection  (ditto, actually I bought her Let it rain album before this).
Coffee count: XXX   I have this thing about numbers that borders to obsessive compulsive(OC). If I jog on the treadmill, the speed must be rounded or to the half kilometer/hour mark. So I either jog at 8,8.5 or 9 km/h. The period that I jog must also be rounded, its either 20 or 30 minutes and 5 minutes of cooldown. And the total distance must be exact as well. 4 or 5 kilometer. 4.3 or 5.1 kilometer is a big sin. Of course sometimes I do bend the rules and that is why I said it was bordering on OC.  Following through with this obsession, I am thinking of getting a heart rate monitor to do just that while I am jogging. Oooh, this is going to be fun.
Coffee count: X   I think I lead a pretty boring life but a complicated one on some levels. If I were to choose one film that nearly resembles my life, it would be Lost in Translation. If my life were to be made in to a film, I wonder who would play me?
Coffee count: XX   Wimbledon serves another surprise with the women singles last night. Maria Sharapova won by defeating Serena Williams. She totally deserved the win and hopefully we will see more of her winning more grandslams after this.  Now for the men's finals.  This is a picture I took when I was in Kuala Terengganu. The weather was nice, not like the "fabulous" English weather at Wimbledon.

I could only draw stick figures and sometimes they don't come out right either. As I progressed through life, I met new people and learned new things. One of the things that I picked up was the appreciation of art.   Yesterday, I bought a painting in a furniture store in Kota Bharu. The last place you would expect to find a painting.  I needed something to hang on the spartan wall at my place and while browsing through the the dried plants and vases, there on the wall hanged the painting. I did not know who painted it, but on the yellow price sticker it said "colouful poster". I am not sure if that is the title of the painting or the shop keepers name for the painting. I suspect the latter as there were another 2 variations of the painting also labelled "colourful posters".  The painting is acrylic on canvas, about 100cmx50cm and I got it for RM190. I consider that a bargain since some of the paintings that I looked at in KL was at least twice the price. I also had a reproduction of Van Gogh's starry night hanged at my place, but so far none of my friends were excited when they saw i
