one way. We had to drive all the way back around the airport.(Lap 1) Then we went in through the baggage claim and pick up line. Unfortunately you can't stop there unless the party you are picking up is ready. Back around the airport.(Lap 2) Then I thought I could find a parking spot on the side of the road, unfortunately they were reserved for limos and buses. My friend pointed out one that looked like I could park in, but I missed it. Back around the airport.(Lap 3) Yep, it only looked like I could park there. Limos and buses only. Back around the airport. (Lap 4) As we started our next lap my friend noticed the sign for short term parking...as we passed it. Back around the airport.(Lap 5) Finally, we got into the parking lot and found what we thought was the concourse she would be arriving from. It was now 9:55. so, we sat and waited. The plane arrived and everyone started coming off the plane. We waited and watched all the weary travelers being greeted by there loved ones. We waited and watched as the flight crew came off and then there was no one else. It was now 10:15. No Alana. We decided that maybe we were at the wrong concourse after all and walked towards another one. Half way to it I decided that was the only flight from Minneapolis and we were headed back.

Not to mention my friend and her kid, plus me and my other friend. My plan from there was to take my friend that was kind enough to go there with me home and then take my friend that I picked up, to my house. She had left her car at my house while she was gone, so once we were back there she could drive home. That was the plan. Only, we went the wrong way on the interstate. I ended up driving all the way to my house, dropped Alana and her son off at their car and turned around and drove all the way back past the airport to take my other friend home. Fortunately she was kind enough to let me sleep at her house. By this time it was around 12-ish. From this experience I have decided my "favor " days are over. I have truly been to hell and b
