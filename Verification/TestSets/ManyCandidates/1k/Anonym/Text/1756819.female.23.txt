up to a horse-drawn trailer.  Now that is a strange sight.    Since it was still early and relatively we decided to lose ourselves in the park.  We followed the trails as best as we could, but they were too windy and confusing.  So we simply followed whatever trails we happened upon and enjoyed the fresh air and sunshine.  Walking through the park was certainly a contrast to the downtown area of the island.  It was so quiet and peaceful.  With the exception of a few other walkers, the odd horse and rider, and an occasional bicyclist, it felt like we were all alone.  It was rather nice.   After covering a major chunk of the island on foot we stopped at a little picnic area to eat our lunch.  From there we walked back to the downtown and wandered in and out of the various shops.  And of course we stopped to watch them making fudge.  We bought a sample box, and broke into it while waiting for the next ferry to come and take us back to the mainland.  Back in St. Ignace we wandered through a bookstore, then stopped for a bite of dinner at a 50s style diner.  The strange thing was, the diner had no tourists, it was all locals, even though it was right across the street from all the ferries.    A great, though very tiring day.  I have pictures to share, but I need to download them still.
I had a very strange dream last night/this morning.  I was in some sort of US government organization that was looking for a treasurer.  They were taking nominations, and there were some people who were interested in the position.  But there was a catch.  The job would be in England.  Most people weren't too happy about that, but I thought, hey, sounds great!  So I got my name on the list.  I remember it saying something about my not having any advanced mathematics, but that I would be a quick learner.  Unfortunately I woke up before I found out if I would be moving to England or not.
Yesterday was a great beach day.  After church we grabbed a bite of lunch then headed off to the Grand Haven beach.  Unfortunately everyone else had also decided that it was a great beach day.  All you could see was a sea of bodies, and there was no parking to be found.  So, plan B.  We changed our minds and went to a local park, much fewer people, a less crowded beach, and best of all, available parking!  So we settled down on the sand with our towels, sunscreen and reading material to enjoy the afternoon sun.  Watched a mother bury her son in the sand, kids building sandcastles, couples walking hand in hand along the shore, and one family digging a big hole to bury their father in.  Upon returning home, we picked up some noodle soup after a bit of grocery shopping, and headed home to watch Minority Report.  What a life :)   urlLink    Samara and I at the b
