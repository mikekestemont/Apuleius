and has management experience and good decision-making skills. He's got most of the qualities that make a good leader, in my opinion. And he doesn't come from a background quite so steeped in Washington politics, like a lot of the other Senators, etc. who run for president. It's a shame that his public communication skills aren't the type that engender respect like some orators do. But at the same time, there's something about the way he speaks that doesn't sound he's "talking down" to you. He respects the position of President of the United States and takes his job as Commander-In-Chief very seriously.   Other republicans that I admire as leaders or whose beliefs I tend to agree with are people like John McCain, Rudy Giuliani, and Arnold Schwarzenegger. I like the opinions and viewpoints of people like Dennis Miller and Bill O'Reilly.   But there are many ideas in the more conservative, right-wing spectrum that I just don't agree with, and I think it's a shame that everyone who chooses to call themselves republicans get bundled in with that bunch.   For me, I think it's more about core values. It's amazing to me, and very telling, I think, that party lines tend to break along religious lines as well. By far the majority of people who say they attend church regularly also typically vote republican, and democrats refuse any mention of religion, many times espousing ideas and values that go against most religious values I can think of. There are always the exceptions, of course, but I just ask myself which candidate for president has the record showing most of the values I would want in the leader of the country.   For me, the answer to that most basic of questions is very clear, whether I choose to call myself a republican, democrat, or anything in between.

John Kerry is out jogging one morning and notices a little girl on the corner with a box. Curious, he runs over to her and says, "What's in the box?" The girl says, "Kittens, they're brand new kittens." Kerry laughs and says, "What kind of kittens are they?" "Democrats," the girl replies. "Oh that's cute," he says and goes on his way.  A few days later, John Kerry comes by with his buddy Ted Kennedy and he spies the same little girl with her box. He says, "You gotta check this out. Look in the box, Teddy, isn't that cute? Look at those little kittens. Hey, tell my friend Teddy what kind of kittens they are."  The little girl replies, "They're Republicans." "Whoa!" John Kerry says, "I came by here the other day and you said they were Democrats. What's up?"  "Well," the girl explains, "their eyes are open now."
