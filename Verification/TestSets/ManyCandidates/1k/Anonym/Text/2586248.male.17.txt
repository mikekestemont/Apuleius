are prsent in all hallways, providing fast T1 connections."  After our little tour, we went out to 116th and looked for a restaurant. I actually saw my RA from the Columbia program, Mike Kwon, in a grocery store and I was so glad to have seen him. We went over to the West End, where we had a very nice lunch.  After lunch, John suggested we see Union Square. So, we went all the way downtown again. But, it was definitely worth it -- we had a black guy dressed like an 18th century Englishman, with a cane and tophat and all, (eerily looking like Jeffrey the butler from "Fresh Prince") sing Marco a Hebrew song. We all chipped in for the donation. And, then! Courtney ran after a "6 foot 7 Jew who will freestyle rap" (a cardboard sign one of the members of his entourage was holding) who was, in fact, Jesus from Short Hills, NJ. He immediately came over and rapped for us. With his overflowing hair and facial hair, coupled with the white flowing shirt and pants (that had a huge hole, allowing us to notice that he had blue boxers on), he was Jesus. He freestyled rap something, whatever came to his mind and ended with something like, "Duck duck goose, duck duck goose..." We caught him later, feverishly waving his arms about, miraculously healing a boy standing before him. I don't think I've ever spent free time with friends that was quite as interesting as that.  We went up to Times Square after that and took Marco to the huge Virgin Megastore. John, Ben, Brian, and I were so tired we just sat down in one of the aisles while the others looked for music. We went to Coldstone Creamery, which Chrissy said was quite good, although John and I got split off from the group for a few minutes. We went and all of us, except Chrissy (who had a dinner with an ex -bf at 9:30) and John, got something-- I got Chocolate Cherry Cheesecake Chill, or something to that effect. I gave them a tip and the whole staff started singing, it was cool.  We broke up soon after that. I told Marco to give me a call before he left New York and I will surely miss John's lessons. But, I will take his advice, not to burn any bridges with him or the others. The guys from northern NJ want to put together a trip to Six Flags, but I don't know if I can make that this month. I hope Chrissy had a great time on her dinner date thing and, if I get to Georgetown, I want to see her again and probably before that.  Courtney knows that I was rushing to get to my train. But, I'm glad I stayed for the ice cream and for a goodbye that will probably be the last one for some time, especially to Marco (except online of course). I missed that train. But, you know what? It was worth i
