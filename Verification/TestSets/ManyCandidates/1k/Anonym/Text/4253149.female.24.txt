yet there are traits in each of them that one can find relatable. I’ve identified with each of the characters at various points. After more than a few late nights watching episode after episode, I felt like I knew them so well that I could just walk up to them in the coffee shop and join in the conversation seamlessly.  But just when I thought it was safe to watch mainstream TV in the millennium, it happened. This morning before I went to work I watched the sixth season episode where Miranda starts flirting with a new neighbor. This neighbor happens to be black, and is the first time in the history of a show, which is based in one of the most racially diverse cities in the world, that a black character is seriously introduced.  When I saw him my radar went up, and as much as I wanted to suppress it and just enjoy the episode, the questions begged to be asked “Are we there yet? Are we finally at that point where every man is a man, or do we still feel the need to subcategorize, scandalize, and otherize men (or women) who are not white? Will this character be treated as a man…..or a Black man?”  My first hunch towards the answer came when Miranda and her new male friend, Robert, are watching a show about an interracial relationship that mirrored theirs (black male, white female). In listening to the tv characters’ dialogue, Robert realizes that the couple is British, to which Robert- an upperclass doctor who works for the Knicks- replies “Gotta luv a brutha with an accent…”  In case you didn’t notice he was black, folks.  I rewound and replayed the line, holding on to hope that my burning ears were wrong and that a show that is otherwise ahead of its time was above this. But it was a no-go. The brotha was othered.  Other viewers may have missed that subtlely, and lest the writers risk that chance they made certain to unreserverdly other him for the rest of the show. Throughout the remainder of the show he was referred to as “a handsome black man”, “black boyfriend”, “black doctor”.  This is sooo 40 years ago that I don’t even know what to say that shouldn’t already be blatantly obvious. Color of skin vs. content of character? It’s all been said before. I am proud of being black, and I am proud of black people, in all the many colors and cultures from whence they come, and my criticism s not about erasing blackness-whatever that means. What I do want to erase is the racism that makes a physical feature as useless as race so prime that we use it to judge, categorize, and divide ourselves from others. I want to erase the racism the normalizes one racial group in mainstream TV, but otherizes all other people such that race is the primary trait that is used to describe and understand the non-white character. It is divisive, stigmatizing, misleading, useless, and unnecessary.
