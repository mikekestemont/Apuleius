The new uniforms are very different from the old ones. They fit alright except for the shoulder area is tight. The worst part about them is that they don't breathe. This became too obvious yesterday as I had my toughest day to date. The day was busy, and nothing I couldn't handle, but because the shirt doesn't ventilate very well, I was hot most all of the day. I was hitting it hard at about 10 p.m., and barely made it through the remainder of the night. Hence the title of this post, "Carry me home in a casket."  I am very pleased that today is my Friday. However, with all the stuff here at home that needs to be caught up on, I doubt that this will be a very relaxing two days off. But as long as the check comes, I can't complain too much I guess. However I am thinking that our superiors are demanding a lot of us. None in my department like the new clothes. The look is  tolerable , but the functionality is minimal. I'm glad I look decent in blue. At least it isn't a chicken or hot dog promotional-type suit. Thankfully we don't do that kind of thing.
Now I am not the most tech-savvy person around, but I am always glad that I can find my way around concerning computers and technology in general. At work I listened to some talk about technology, and I often have to bite my tongue, because a part of me wants to correct the person(s) in their erranious talk. Maybe I should have: I am gentle and understanding. Perhaps they could see the light from me instead of the annoying know-it-alls who would not hesitate to guffaw at first chance.  Maybe you should disregard that paragraph up there. I know how to operate computers, but as for the inner workings, there is plenty that eludes me.  I'm a little down tonight. Maybe it's just from the overload today.  To my credit, today went well. I made a bit less than $2 in tips, but for someone like me, and my position, that is something. I worked alone and thus it was my time to shine. I was even told that one of the high-ups would be hearing of my exceptional work. Still, I am down. I guess it is because it's finally sinking in that my old routines aren't mine anymore. I no longer have the freedoms I enjoyed a month ago. Plus I don't like the drive to work. I've been wondering if it is going to be worth it, with gas and all. At current rates, gas would be about $60-70 for two weeks. Man, when you think about it, that is a big chunk of change.  The people I have the privilige of working with are the ones who make an otherwise monotonous job bearable. This fondness that I have for them exceeds departments. God bless them every one.  Today will be the first day of wearing our new uniforms. This should be i
