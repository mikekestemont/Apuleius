mix of maturity and innocence. They love me any which way. Whether I am being preachy, bad-tempered or nasty. They smile and indulge me. They actually look after my needs so well. They spoil me rotten and I am thankful to them for that. They depend on me for the notes I can make out of the very difficult subjects that they never understand really and I depend upon them to tell me where I go wrong with my practicals. It’s a life that I am living once more when I was 18 when they come and tell me their heartaches and breaks, the boys they like and have crushes on. It’s an adventure with them and I don’t want to trade it ever for anything else. Never have I felt so great having such a great bunch of friends. Thank God.
Believing in the karma theory can be very confusing. For me it is more so because I believe only in one part of it. The Divine Justice that I keep talking about is something I know happens, but rebirths I don’t want. Do I want to know that all my actions will generate some fruits and if they are not finished in this birth then I take it to the next one. Do I want to take birth again? It’s difficult to believe in this theory when you don’t believe in rebirths.   Karma stays with you whether you like it or no. You have to know that whatever you do will generate a reaction and it will come back to you ten-fold. The sufferings you heap on others will be unbearable to you if you face it. The happiness you spread around will be amazing when you get it in return.   But there are few things that are out of our control. Like hurting others without meaning to. One knows that by taking a certain action, one is right. But it is wrong for the other person. And one suffers. You turn around and ask God if that was fair. But when Pandavas fought for their right, were they happy after that? They were unhappy because they lost their families. So even if your actions are right, it makes others unhappy, you can be sure you will be unhappy too. It’s a very dicey situation, one, which cannot be explained by anybody.    Hindu philosophy is very interesting. It gives you so much space to grow as a person. Its’ religious intentions are not to kill anybody but find liberation even if one is a non-believer. And it is not necessary to pray to find moksha (liberation). One can find it through dharma (duty), kama (physical) or artha (financial). But one can also find it by going beyond the mundane and realizing the self. Self- realization means being introspective and knowing yourself and trying to be as selfless and active as He Himself.    But I know one thing for sure and that is whatever I do, I will reap the benefits of it in this birth and not the next o
