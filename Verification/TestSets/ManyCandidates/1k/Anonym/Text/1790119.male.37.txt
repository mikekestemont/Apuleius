If anyone is waiting..found this on the A&E discussion board.  Sounds reasonable   "Yes, MI-5 aka Spooks, is returning in the fall to A&E. A&E holds the U.S. broadcast rights to the show. From the BBC, A&E bought the right to hack the originial show (Spooks) into bits, insert commercials and oodles of inane graphics. And yet, we watch! MI-5 is just that good.  BBC America can't air the shows because A&E has the rights to them. As for when they'll air Series III or Season 3 or whatever...BBC will air Spooks in the early fall and then A&E will follow 6-8 weeks later with MI-5. All 10 episodes are scheduled to air...we think. That is all we know because A&E isn't talking. Apparently it's a big ol' secret and no one will know it's coming back until it creeps up on us.   This new-fangled thing called Advertising or Marketing, or simply ANNOUNCING A RETURN DATE is far too complicated for the folks at A&E but we will persist in checking and reading BBC news to get the A&E news."
I've been playing with Google's new mail service called   urlLink Gmail   for a while now and really like it.   By jumping into the fray with a new approach (read: virtually unlimited storage)it has changed the capacity "ceiling" approach set by other free mail services (yahoo and Hotmail). Its also forced them to adopt a cleaner simplier layout approach.  urlLink Google  is where its at.   If you want me to get you a gmail account during this "beta" period let me know.   - Eman
