to what the hell is going on. Back on subject, please note that I haven't even attempted to go into reasons behind the effectiveness of any tactics such as protesting/lobbying voting/etc. But I do have three questions for you: 1) Towards what ends do you think the DNC and RNC protesters 'don't do shit,' your ends or theirs? 2) What do you think the protesters' goals are? And what are your goals within the same scope? and 3) Assuming they could be used towards the same ends, what is preventing someone from, say, doing both protesting and lobbying?
urlLink Who needs the nominated candidate anyway?   Yeah, Ralph, try to tear apart the state Green Party with the highest number of members. That's really helpful.
It looks like the Nader campaign is foundering.  urlLink According to the New York Times , Ralph's only made it on the ballot in six states so far. Compare this to 2000, when, as the Green Party nominee, he was on the ballot in about 43 states. He's not doing any better from a money standpoint, either; a quick check at  urlLink opensecrets.org  has revealed that Nader's raised about $1.5 million so far. Quite a drop from 2000, when he managed to raise $8.4 million.  It sounds like Ralph's glory days are over. At this point, I'll be surprised if he breaks 1% of the vote.
urlLink ...is hilarious.
Of course we all heard about how George W. Bush wants to be the  urlLink ">Peace President , but what you may not know is that libertarian candidate Michael Badnarik ran ads earlier in the season proclaiming  himself  the peace candidate.   (commentary on this  urlLink here ,  urlLink here , and  urlLink here .  I couldn't find an actual link to the ad, but I did see it more than once while it was out.)  What of Ralph Nader?  Of course, he devotes an entire page on his 'issues' section to  urlLink peace .  David Cobb of the Green Party  urlLink says : "I am a peace candidate, and we are running unflinchingly on that message."  And don't even get me started on the "Peace and Freedom Party."    But, for Democratic Nominee John Kerry,  urlLink Peace is Not On-Message.   So, we have 6 parties, 6 candidates, and 5 of them are talking up peace.  Which one are you going to vote for?
I randomly stumbled upon a blog today, and the guy seems to have very few readers, and he was complaining about having no one linking to him, and I liked the cut of his jib.  I could relate to all of those problems, plus he's a huge geek.  So I figured I'd give him some interesting link text:  urlLink a great blog!!!111@   I mean, why not?   I also added him to the blogroll.  I don't know why I do anything around here.  In fact, I suck at blogging.. but Cole is getting pretty good at it.
It's a link that, presumably, does not suck.  urlLink DC Political Report  doesn't really do commentary, but it has a wealth of daily election-related news l
