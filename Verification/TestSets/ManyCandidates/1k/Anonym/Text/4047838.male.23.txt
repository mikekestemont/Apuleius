on my work rate. If I keep stumbling along dead-end paths then it will take all the more time to get to the pinnacle.  For a while, it was hard deciding which mountain to climb. I would start on one, and after a little bit of trekking, I would decide that I didn't like the flora and/or fauna I encountered, so I would start on another, and before the end of the day I would have started on several different mountains but would find myself, again, at the base of all these different mountains, having made no ground whatsoever.  At times the path can be rough, and hard to walk across, but its never impossible, how far you can go depends on how committed you are to reaching the peak.  My problem has been:  Which Peak?
Sometimes you look back at your life, your experiences or your relationships. Then you look into the hypothetical present, and then you are left with the prospects of 'what ifs' and 'maybes'. But I think the worst of all, are the questions that begins and ends with 'Why?'

So what am I saying? ...Its rare for me to be mute, I am a very talkative induividual, in fact, when I was in pre school, I had my mouth taped because I spoke so much. Can you believe that? I was like 3 and they taped my mouth up! You don't believe me? You have to keep in mind that I was still in an Asian country back then. Ahh... Its always refreshing to laugh at yourself!
Every so often I will find myself in a state of confusion. I ask questions about myself and my life direction. New reasons arise for why I should do this or why I shouldn't do that. All too often it is easy to get carried away on these whims. Unfortunately for me, life isn't so fatastical. But then again, I never do regret the life decisions I make.
