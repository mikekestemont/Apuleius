short - it's hard to talk while I'm at work, and sometimes the cell doesn't get the best reception inside the building.  Anyway, glad to hear you are doing so well!
Just a few things to mention:  Diana - I don't know what keeps happening, but, once again, you aren't listed on the "Member" page at all.  Right after I sent you another "invitation" email, you showed up as being in "pending" status, but, now you don't show up at all.  John, Lis, Monica - get on the ball and sign up for goodness sake.  You've all been "pending" for weeks now.  We want your active participation here, so give us what we want.  Welcome to Lisa!  Lisa, I got the pictures that you sent.  Where the hell did the picture of Rob, RHODA VALPATEC [sp?], and myself come from?!?  I don't remember that occasion at all!  By the look on my face, it must've been while Rhoda and I were "going out"...  What was I thinking?  The big group picture must've been at some dinner party - was it a COUPLES thing?  That one is so good that I think that I will just figure out how to post it in a actual post rather than shrinking it down to fit on the side.  If I shrunk it, you wouldn't get to see everyone's bright, shining faces.  Oh, and the one of you 4 Purdue Ladies [that's what I named the photo] is just SO college.  Amber and Derrick have been sent "invitations" to join!  Amber is now completely aware of what we are doing here, but it looks like she might not be able to attend in December.  I'll let her tell you why when she signs up and starts posting.  As for Derrick, I found an email from him off of his personal website:   urlLink http://www.forchetti.org/ .  Oh, and exploring a little more there, I just found an MSN email address that I will try sending something to as well.  Haven't officially gotten his attention/participation, but hopefully we are on our way.  Oh, and I'm hoping that Amber can get us back in touch with Amy Davis.  She [Amy] contacted me a few years back, we lost touch, and a couple of weeks ago  I tried calling the number that I had for her but it wasn't an active number anymore...  I called Ream's parents last week and left a message on their machine asking them to pass along to Michelle my contact info.  Haven't heard anything from her yet, so I may call them again this week.  I did a search on whitepages.com for "Winquist" and "Chesterton" - assuming that HER parents were still in the same place - and came up with a Winquist on some strange street that I had never heard of.  Anyone know where she and Rob are [I'm assuming that they are married by now...]?  It seems like when I last heard from/about them they were both working/in school at UIC.  Actually, maybe that was when I talked to them at Diana's w
