her day. It is good to offload to someone else, as well as hear about how her experience is for her as well.  Tomorrow will be day 2 of getting enrolled. Lets see how that goes.
Well we meet again, this time I am in Oahu, a beautiful island part of the state of Hawaii USA. I arrived last night at 11:20pm Hawaii time. The flight wasn't too bad, around 10 hours duration. I am staying at the Ocean Resort Hotel Waikiki. It is great, close to everything. I am sharing a studio unit with a girl called Hege from Norway. She is here studying on exchange just like me. I didn't get up to much last night, Kerri-Ann my wonderful Hawaiian contact picked me up from the airport. It was great to see a familiar face, she presented me with gifts of a necklace, a flowers lei and a candy lei. It was lovely.  I got to the hotel and was famished, I had to walk 5 blocks to find a convience store to get something to eat, phoned home and then forced myself to lay and rest to help the time difference. It is 20 hours behind Sydney over here.  The weather today has been beautiful. I went shopping to Ala Maona. It is a big mall on the other side of town. Over here they only know two directions, the mountains is one way, and the ocean is the other. Kerri-Ann said I should never get too lost, cause all you have to do is just look around and walk the other way.  My experiences with American/Hawaiian culture have already cracked me up. The money is the worst, I have to make sure I look at the notes properly as the money all looks the same. The coins are a pain as well. I had to ask someone how much a dime was, I have since found out it is 10 cents, see my nan was right, you learn something new everyday. Getting the bus to the shops was funny as well, I went to pay the driver and he laughed, and instructed me to put the money in this little machine, and I said to him, do I get a ticket, and he giggled again and said well do you want one, and I felt a little silly.  Everyone has been really friendly, there seems to be a lot of tourists and visiting people here, so much that it almost seems hard to pick out who are locals and who are not.  The view from my room is breath taking. On one side you see mountains, and the other side is the ocean, blue and sparkling. Around the city it is very green, lots of trees and plants, it is a really clean and beautiful place. I will post some photos as I have a new digital camera now, but I will have to wait til I go to uni tomorrow so I can do it. I am using the hotel computers and it costs alot of m
