then back to Calgary and back to Korea again, without ever using. That was easy to get rid of. Some of it, I bought recently, decided I hated, and don't wear. That stuff was easy to throw away. Some of it I really like, but use very infrequently, and that's harder to let to. I thought of it in a different way tonight. I thought, "No matter how much I like this color, no matter how good it looks on me, do I really want to hang onto eyeshadow that I've had since grade 11?" Jeez, when I think of it that way, it's kind of disgusting. Really gross, actually. Spending July in Cheongju probably aged it as much as five years in Calgary did.   cleaning house... I came back from vacation to discover some weird shit happening with my drains. I think things are growing in them. Ewww. Which makes me doubly glad that I bleached everything excessively before I left. I meant to defrost my fridge as well, but didn't quite get around to it, so that's one thing I'm doing tonight. I should do it more often, it's helping cool down my apartment.  For those who know about living in hot, humid places, what do you use to clean? What kills bacteria and mold completely? Other than dousing the surface with alcohol and setting fire to it?   and cleaning out the closet. While I was on vacation, I changed my earrings a fair bit. Well, twice anyways, which is really often for me. And it started me thinking, why do I still have all these earrings in my ears? I have three in each of my lobes, and one at the top of my left ear as well. What kind of statement am I making? What's the point? I've had them for so long I don't know why I have them anymore, they've gotten to be a habit, and a kind of annoying one too. I think I might like accessorizing, if it didn't take as much effort to change all the earrings all the time.  It makes me wonder, how much of what I wear and do and think are just habits that I've accumulated, that don't have a reason anymore, that if I re-evaluated them, I'd actually really like something else much more. Maybe I need to do a little more intellectual cleaning, go shopping for new ideas and try them on, get rid of those old patterns of thought that I slip into just because that's what's there, it's comfortable and it's easy.
I am back from my vacation. I was having too much fun to blog about it. And no photos will be posted because, well, I didn't take any photos.  So, let's continue the guessing game, shall we? By the way, these clues are like annoying crossword puzzle type clues. So, when I tell you what the hell they mean, you'll be really really annoyed by how much sense they make, without making sense at all.   Clue 2: Once, stretching from Morocco to E
