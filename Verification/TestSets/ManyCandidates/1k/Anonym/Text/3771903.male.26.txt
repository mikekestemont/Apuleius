like the other ones   This can't be good   It's brown and darker   dark?   oh my god, was that the end? It couldn't' be,       my ..............    .............my shoulder hurts!   I feel pain I must be alive         The following ten minutes comprised of my laying there smoking three cigarettes and cursing the fact that I can't walk.  The following 60 hours have provided enough time to realize- that fall should have done me in. That was my second chance to get out- yet I kept myself here for 'something'. I can only say that 'something' is to 'feel alive'.  And i am     but I know I will die again
I sat there gazing at a whole lot of hazy nothing. 3 hour hike up a mountain, to bask in the glorious haze. I didn't mind so much, since I was amazed that I was there in the first place. I rested for about half an hour before I started down. Had I known that it was going to be the last time for a month that my arm wasn't gonna be in a sling, I might have made it 40 min.  I came to a spot in the trail that dropped off about 4 feet. Loose gravel and stones, but nothing (I thought) I couldn't handle. I grabbed a near-by branch for support and reached my foot over the edge. Unfortunately my foot kept going- loose stone doesn't make a good anchor point. My foot, leg, and body, all at once, began to fall. My first thought was- 'good thing I'm holding onto this branch'. My second thought was 'fuck that hurts' as I dislocate my right shoulder.  Most folks can go a week hiking with only a few minor bruises. I go 5 hours and dislocate an arm. It wouldn't have been that bad, except I still had an hour hike to just get to my car- the nearest hospital? Dammed if I know.  I don't remember much of the hike after that. Carrying a day-pack on a dislocated shoulder isn't something I'm used to, nor the accompanying pain. I don't remember calling my doctor or driving to the hospital. I do remember the lovely sound it made when the Doctor popped it back in place. I wish I could get a recording of that... that... Squishy crunch.  So, for about a month I have to keep my arm in a sling, physical therapy after that. Is the job worth this? Loosing the use of my right arm for the sake of a pay check. What have I allowed myself to become?  I could remember days I took off because my foot hurt- now I don't even take a day off when I dislocate a shoulder.  I guess this is growing up.            and I had promised myself I would never grow up
I feel like I'm dreaming. That as I look down at the highways and specs of towns, that this isn't really happening. I'm not sitting on this plane right now. I'm actually curled up in a ball under my blankets blissfully d
