cleaning out my closet (eminem...) i found this paper we did for creative writing in 4th grade. and i've come to the conclusion that i was insane. ill put the text of it in, complete with errors, because i'm supremely bored. here goes:  Teacher for a Day Hello, my name is Mr. Sikkema.Or at least it was a few days afo when I was the teacher for a day. THat morning i made four main rules.1.No eating or drinking in class. 2.No disrespecting your peers. 3.Act Safely. 4.No Homework !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. If you were to break one of these rules then you would get a warning. If you did it again then you would have to lick the bottoms of everyone's feet. Creating assignments was pretty fun. THe hardest assignment I gave was in math. It was doing the whole book;but if you didn't finish it by the end of the day, you could just stop.The longest assignment I gave was in English. They had to memorize 17 words and their definitions in one letter of the alphabet.  But it was all worth it: In gym we went bunjee jumping. Two really great things happened that day:A kid who just got back from Hawaii brought me a coconut and I escaped death.See, a psychopathic nun on the loose got into the school and shot at me. But I dodged the bullet with the greatest of ease and it punctured another kid's lung. The only hard part about being the teacher is yard duty.One kid broke his leg, another threw up, and another kid had a concussion when he fell off the seings. And all this happened at the same time!I was the only teacher out there so I just sat by the baseball fields. Things didn't get any better in class though: One kid forgot his name and another lost his desk.The worst problem was my student for the day. She jumped on my desk and started tap-dancing! There was only one thing I could do with her: Lick the bottoms of everyone's feet. I mad e some changes in class to make life easier: I made the lunches and gave them another half hour of recess. I tried not to make anything to hard for the students because i knew how it felt to get tons of homework.At the end of the day, I felt exhausted. I learned that being a teacher is the greatest job ever!  and that was it. 1ts 5.42 on the flesch kincaid scale....and that's cool for 4th grade. now ima haffa continue to pack my room.

this move angers me for a variety of reasons. i dont want to get into them, as i said before, but it should suffice to say this: today my parents flat-out told me that my opinion didn't matter. they said i could move out when i turn 18. as unlikely as that is, its nice to have it put out there that im not needed. and that is how my day has gone so far. fuck it.
