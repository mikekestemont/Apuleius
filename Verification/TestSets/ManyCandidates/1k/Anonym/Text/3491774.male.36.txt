he just admitted it?  People are being killed because of that decision.  I think it's over 1000 "allied" troops plus countless citizens of all nations involved.  The decent act would be to admit to the wrong-doing and act to remedy it.  The remedy would be to bring freedom to Iraqi civilians.    As it currently stands, we now need to stay in Iraq and stabilize the region.  Pulling out is not viable.  Iraq is now a haven for those who hate America because of the invasion.  We had assumed that Iraqi's would have a love-fest with us, their invaders.  We need to make Iraq  love  America.  Somehow.  In all the confusion, we have completely forgotten about our real enemy - those who instigated 911.  This is classic for America.  We get distracted by unimportant stuff.  Bush must go.    Maybe next election there will be somebody who I can believe in on the Republican ticket.  It most definitely is not Bush.
A quick interruption from my political meanderings.  I'm an Asimov fan.  Just saw an add for the movie  urlLink I, Robot .  I have a strong expectation that it bears no resemblance to the stories in the book.  Just robots and the  urlLink three laws of robotics .  Having said that, the movie actually might be pretty fun.  Here's hoping that I'm not disappointed!
I am quite frustrated by politics this year.  I was in 2000 also, but I wasn't blogging then.  My two bit description of my political views is that I generally socially liberal (please don't get in a snit about that word) but fiscally conservative (I'm a cheapskate).   I believe in freedom for all and am proud to be an American.  I'll state up front that I am not voting for Bush.  I didn't in 2000 and nothing he has done has convinced me to vote for him this year.  I am not a card-carrying Democrat, but I see no other choice.  My strategy is to remove Bush.  Since there are no other viable parties that I see being elected, I'll be casting my vote with Kerry.  I do not agree with everything he says, but he'll be an improvement.  I want to explore a bit, and this forum is as good as any.  Work is taboo, home can be taboo and I'd rather not get the family riled up with me, so the blog is it.
I've been putzing around with blogger and trying to find others' blogs.  There are links on my profile for state, city, interests, and the like.  From the dashboard, I can see recent posts by others.  But, that's it.  People cannot just go to  urlLink blogger.com  or  urlLink blogspot.com  and search.  Are there people actually trying to find others?  Or, must we sign in and setup as many interests as we can just to locate other blogs of interest?  Seems to be lacking a bit of user friendliness!  Maybe a "locate a blogger" that lets me plop in this information.  Maybe I want to see people in, say, Minnteonka, MN.  No clue how to do t
