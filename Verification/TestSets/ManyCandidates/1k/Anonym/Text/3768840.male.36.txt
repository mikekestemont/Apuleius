OK, here's a little something you probably don't know about me: I listen to  San Francisco's Classical radio station,    urlLink KDFC  , all day while I work. It's partially because I enjoy Classical music (except for fucking Bolero and Max Bruch's awful, insipid Scottish Fantasy) and partially because I don't want to bother my sweet, elderly Austrian neighbor with the subwoofer vibrations caused by, say, The Black Dahlia Murder or ADULT. I can't work with headphones, or else I'd miss lots of phone calls.  KDFC is a fine station (although I still pine for Boston's WCRB), and I like their radio personalities just fine. What I hate,   HATE  , I tell you, are their idiotic, cloying, drippy commercials. Some of the worst are for the Walk Shop in Berkeley ("...as you stroll down the Champs Elysees..."), Albertson's ( "...chicken breasts, moist and tenDERrrr, nintety NINE cents a pound in the Value Pack..." (no , wait, that's Safeway... more on them later)), or the Midsummer Mozart Festival ("...I'm Helena (imagine a supremely troublesome and unidentifiable but probably Slavic accent), the Festival director, and though I kid, and thank, the mayor..."). Apparently, the advertisers on KDFC are attempting to appeal to an audience that is a) old, b) in possession of plenty of leisure time, c) terribly status-conscious, (to a pathological degree, even) and d) fucking LOOOOADed.  The worst ads on KDFC, though, are easily the ones for    urlLink Shreve and Company  . They sell, apparently, something called a "Hearts on Fire" diamond (are you sick yet?). The chief suppostion of their marketing people is that everyone is shallow and anxious to give in to societal pressures, even at great personal financial expense (hey, that's probably true, actually). Most aggravating is that the theme of EVERY SINGLE FUCKING AD THEY'VE EVER BROADCAST is that women will pretty much pee their pants if presented with a "Hearts on Fire" diamond, and since a woman's involuntary loss of bladder control is the fondest wish of every groom-to-be, well... draw your own damned conclusion, I'm choking back bile just thinking about it.  The woman who does the weekly voiceovers for Safeway annoys me, too, but she seems to have been supplanted... hopefully she's suffocating under a great mass of those moist and tender chicken breasts.  --TPB
It's true! My recently finished drawing    urlLink shoukaiju   will be in a group exhibition called    urlLink Thunder Lizard Sushi Stomp   at Skeleton Art Gallery in Santa Fe, NM from August 13-September 16. If you're in the area, stop by and have a look, there are a lot of great artists participating.  I'm playing way too much NWN: Hordes of the Underdark.  --TPB
Just randomly, here are some titles that I think I&#8217;ll turn into drawings or paintings.     Is there nothing he is not?       If you cut them, do they not scream?   --or--  See How They Bleed       The Shaved Wound       The Sugar Miser       Raisin-Hearted      So there you go.    -
