as big a risk making the bet as you do calling it.  this isn't a cautious, one-dollar probe around your rectum; no, this is a spit-lubed finger straight to the prostate.  do you gasp and kiss harder, or do you wriggle free?  it's not about love, it's about satisfaction.  let's cut the bullshit.
Last night, by any account, was a slaughter. The innocent and meek were separated from their money with frightening speed and accuracy. A lot of it, I think, was just bad calls, the kind of thing you have to get out of your system before you can call yourself a good player.  The question that remains in my mind is: what do you do when you have a solid hand, but not the nuts... and a stranger bets $10 (half your stake) against you?  In some ways, it would be easier if you're playing a drawing hand. Memorize the  urlLink pot odds  and do some quick math. Of course, you have to consider whether you would be drawing to a losing hand -- but still, it boils down to a question that requires intelligence, not intuition, to answer.  (And anyway, pot odds dictate folding to a big bet most of the time.)  I read a while ago that a bet is at its heart one of two statements: I think I'm going to win, or you think you're going to lose. But that's I read a while ago that a bet is at its heart one of two statements: I think I'm going to win, or you think you're going to lose. But that's bullshit. People make all kinds of bets -- bluffs, semi-bluffs, bets masquerading as bluffs and semi-bluffs, bets to gather information, bets to increase pot odds, bets to decrease pot odds, bets designed to make people playing lesser hands feel confident.  It's really a language unto itself, and nobody wants you to understand what they are saying. There's a secondary language, of physical tells and subtextual clues, but you can't rely on it. You have to listen to the way people lie to divine the truth.  The problem with the $10 bet is that it's the equivalent of bellowing "I LOVE YOU!" in the middle of pillow talk. There's no way to know what it really means. Maybe it's just a massive bluff, maybe he's trying to kill anyone on a flush draw, maybe he thinks his kicker will squeak by yours, maybe he wants to establish a presence at the table, maybe he just wants your money, maybe...  So is it a bad call or not? You just don't know, and there are so few things that can help you figure things out.   Related reading:   urlLink Mind Games
This was Omaha Hi-Lo. I felt pretty good at the turn -- though I was a little worrried of 9-9, everyone had limped in when I bet after the flop. Maybe a few playing a wheel draw or something. The guy who won checked to me on the river, which might have been a courtesy or just t
