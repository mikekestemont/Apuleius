hi daddy. schools started, and as far as i can tell, its going to be a very interesting year. i have to ride two buses (transfer) and it takes like an hour. ive changed alot over the summer and im a very different person than who i used to be. i take walks late @ night because i cant sleep and i love the rain. i listen to mostly rock, and as always, i save jacob from shelby.   love, ellie
i guess things are back to what they used to be, right? me talkin to you, or what i think you are, and you stay confined to your self, a million miles away.
On Saturday we went through all the stuff in grandma’s and grandpa’s basement. Including your stuff. Mom threw away a lot of cords and computer parts, but lots of stuff she let us keep. I have a pipe, which mom thinks belongs to the Chief, two Zippo lighters, your diploma, the old ashtray, your grandpa’s glasses (grandpa Jack’s daddy’s), an old ring, your dog tags, a bracelet of grandpa Jack’s that says “JACKIE”, and some other stuff I can’t remember. It’s all been put away into the house we’re moving into in J-town. If you remind in an email, I’ll send the address to you. The subdivision we moved to has a cop living on every corner! One even lives across the street! Even though we moved, I and Shelby are still going to Highland, and Jacob still to Field. This year, im going to be in 8th grade, and my friend Liz has gotten a key to every locker, classroom, and one to the elevators! We plan to be remembered. We’re also getting a new principal. Mr. Hickman… something like that. Our new chorus teacher from last year quit! (Ha~ we made her quit!) So now the new piano teacher is going to be the chorus teacher. Well, that’s all for now…. Love, E
