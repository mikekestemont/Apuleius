as my own," she spoke as she soothed them, "and memory of Aethor's death has driven me to mercy."  And before she left the dungeons, she touched each of the five upon their brow, and eased from them their hunger and thirst and the horrors still near to their hearts. Long she lingered over the Aros himself, striving to undo much that she had done in the conquest of his mind. Only when his thoughts were knitted together again did she remove her hand, and with the rising of the light in the east, she did them a curtsy and departed.  The days that passed them seemed both short and long, for though they were no longer taken for new torment, and both food and drink were brought to them each sunset, it seemed as a new torture, for they knew not what might befall them next.  Then at last the Dark Queen returned, and she wore her grief about her like a cloak. Long she lingered without speech before she cried, "But to stand again before the forge and craft something other than death with my hands."   Levi raised his voice then, and said, "Help us then and I shall take you back to Rel Aren, and you can stand before the forge fire."   The Queen laughed then, and it was a dark and bitter sound. "Ah, so you would appease me Swan Knight? And what shall you offer me if I confess I miss seeing the forge fire reflected in my lover's eyes?"  She went then to stand before Eperial, and Eperial felt herself moved to compassion by the sudden pain she beheld in the Dark Queen's eyes. "Tirne, Lady of Aethor, beloved you still are."  Tears came to her eyes then, and the Queen remarked, "Long years it has been since any have called me by that name."  "I was raised in the House of Gilven, and many tales I have heard of the fair lady of Aethor, who was as a mother to his young brothers and a wall against woe to all whom she loved. Though I thought of Gilven as a father, and feared Aethor for his cruelties, it was the memory of Tirne I called mother, not the memory of Aleage."  Bitter then were her tears as she kissed Eperial upon each cheek. "Yet proud would Aleage be to see her daughter grown to wisdom, for little enough do I see of Gilven in you, and so I can claim you not as one grown in the House of Fire." And she went then from their cell and did not hasten to return.
I'm currently neck deep in family trees, maps, papers, and sketches for my newest work. Already this story is vastly different from anything else I've written (which isn't hard, since most of my stories are fanfiction). I'm hoping to put up the preliminary chapter drafts here, as well as some other things - vignettes, and journal entries as well as some writing exercises.  The rest of my stuff is archived at h
