if anyone forgets) Rachael I really wanna go to cedar point because poms isn't going. I guess we can talk about it at your house. We have lots to talk about... orlando, mullet, raccoon, etc.
Alright, so far I am having my movie night. Becca is supposed to call me today and tell me if she can or not. If she can't, i dunno if ill have one then. If i do, BRING MOVIES! I only have like 1 that we could watch. If we haven't seen them, or they are new, just bring em right over. You guys can prolly come over anytime after 11:00 AM. On Saturday you guys can stay as long as you want. If ya wanna bring anything else, you can. I'm so sorry we don't have a pool or anything. :( . Call me if you want to know anything! Brittany, I got your message. I'm so glad your coming!! Oh! and bring your pictures if you have them from Orlando. I'm thinkin we should all take turns and just tell all of our stories without any interruptions. How does that sound? Love, Rarch
Okay Rach I can't find my Buzz Book (it's usually in the cupboard with all the phone books) so I figured you'll probably look at this sometime before Friday.  I'M COMING TO THE MOVIE NIGHT!!!! Woo Hoo!!!
Okay.... that's all...
'''**'''Brittany Lou'''***'''
Ok where is everyone? WE SERIOUSLY NEED TO GET TOGETHER AND PLAN WHAT WE ARE GONNA DO. like movie nights or cedar point, that kinda stuff. Just call eachother and plan a lil somethin. Ok, if Krista doesnt have her movie night this week, i prolly will. So someone inform me when krista is having one. K? I got my pictures back a few days ago already and half of them didnt turn out. I really wanted some with all of the guys ( wink wink) lol. I am so angry that my whole week there, i didnt get any with them. That was practically my  last chance too. Oh well. Love, RAch
That's ok Rachael.. don't feel bad about not getting pics with them... the most fun i had the whole trip was in the airport... Yea.. pretty sad.. but it really was fun :-D
Hi guys!!!!  Orlando was soooo much fun!!!  I think I saw just about everyone except Becca... i saw your brother and a bunch of people from your group, but not you... Oh well, I'll see you at school or at a movie night if we do get around to having one.  Did you all have a great time?  I'm really really sad about Jenn leaving... I'm gonna miss her.  I'm glad I got to see her in Florida though to say good bye.     Yeah, that V Space thing was kind of retarded.  I didn't understand any of it.  And when she was in the hospital and she was almost dead it looked like they brought her back to life with mustard!!!  It was just too weird for me.  Well, I guess I'll talk to you guys later.  luvluv    Brittany L
