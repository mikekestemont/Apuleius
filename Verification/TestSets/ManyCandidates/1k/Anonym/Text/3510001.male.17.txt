nice.     And there is, for you, my readers, two situations that suck ass.
the more important question is if i even want to. but the answer to that question is yes. i want people to engjoy my blog. so how do i attract/entertain readers.   well for starters. i think an important part of any blog is to avoid alienating readers. if they don't know what you are talking about why would they read it. so avoid at all costs inside jokes. never talk to your friends as you would with them. and address them properly as if introducing them.   keep topics to theoligical, philosophical, or social debates. politics is good every now and then, but you don't want to become another news website. to include your audience use large amounts of rhetorical questions. because (1) it gets them thinking even harder and (2) they'll think you are requestion commments. when talking about these topics don't be afraid to be radical. let your guts spill. whatever you think write it. the more radical the more you may anger or enlighten someone and encourage them to comment.  make it personal. because the more personal you make it, the more unique it becomes. but when speaking personally be sure to explain. make sure that whoever reads it will know enough to understand the situation.   show emotion. be pissed, be happy, be depressed. just be something. goddammit.
Now I remember the cartoon. It was cool. But I wanted to know the source of this creative hero. And I found it "The Toxic Avenger." Known for being a gruesomely horrific satire of horror, super heroes, and modern (well the 80s) society.  &nbsp; The humor of Toxie was odd. The acting was horrible. And some of the horribly "avenging" Toxie did made you giggle more than squirm.&nbsp;There was plenty of blood and screaming, as well as horrible acts against innocents such as old people, little kids, blind people, and animals.  &nbsp; Melvin Junko the nerdiest guy in the world is a janitor at Tromaville's health center. Where his coolness is foiled by the hot chicks and cool jocks who tease him. A prank causes him to become into contact with radioactive goo while wearing a tutu. &nbsp; So he ends up a super-powered mutant freak who wears a tutu and cleans up vice with a mop... literally. &nbsp; He ends up with a girlfriend. She's a hot sexy blonde-bimbo. And she's blind so she can't tell what Toxie looks like. But she can feel his cock! Seriosly. There's a hot sex scene, er hot fuck scene. &nbsp; But the underlying political and social statements were good. Such as the ridiculous obsession of muscles and beauty. Then that church doesn't mean crap. And that big business and politicians are evil.  &nbsp; The acting may have been bad. And some of the actions scenes were too long and ended anticlimatically. But that's the point. Just watch it. And laugh. It's comedy. Sick comedy. &nbsp;  urlLink http://www.thetoxicavenger.com  &nbsp;
