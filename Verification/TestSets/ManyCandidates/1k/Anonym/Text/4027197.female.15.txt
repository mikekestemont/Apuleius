it ok, but every once in awhile I'll see something that'll remind me of him. My friends help me get through all those tough times, even though this shouldn't have been one considering he obviously didn't care, and it was only a little bit of time. Im very greatful for the people that are in my life. So now that My ex and I are over, I guess I have to start thinkin about other things.I went shopping. I love shopping. Its like Cher in Clueless.." I needed to find sanctuary in place where I could gather my thoughts and regain my strength...the mall...." haha maybe I'm not a shop-a-holic... On Friday night I went downtown with 2 of my "close friends" yeah...uh huh... it was fun, I saw Tobias, and Garett. I think you spell it like that... It was fun, some lady was handing out baggies of condomns to everyone, and hitting on Tobias. ha ha. That was prety much the highlight of my night. I felt bad b\c earlier that day a guy form my drivers ed class asked me to go to tha movies, I said I would, but I totally blew him off, I never do that. Thats not right, so people, take note....*dont blow people off* So I have to remeber to apologize. I can't get over the fact that a lot of shit keeps comin my way for no reason. I need to be happy again. I have to not give a shit about the stupid people that try to bring me down, and put my stress up! yeah, thats my plan. Today I went to Splash Country, and I saw one of my very few enemys, and she's a lifegaurd, and I was with my mom so not much I could do, so whatever, I guess I can say I went to the waterpark, and got some sun! lol that's always fun. My summer's been great. I've been having a blast. I've met some great new people, Im ready for my girl to get back from canada so I can have something to do! hahaha, well I'm going for now, this is alot of writing! byee
