no great things in life come easy so I sat on my thrown and fought him, for him lol. I tried to show him how magnificent he was in my eyes but I was running off of fools hope and stubbornness. He was everything wanted but I meant nothing to him in that way and to make this long battle a short story, I dropped the hat and we're best friends now.      You know I almost feel like the girl in Sweet November. I seem to have a new guy every month now. I met this guy named Ryan a few weeks ago, different Ryan then the one that left for Europe a few months ago, who by the way got back and realized he didn't like me anymore. But this Ryan is cool. He is 19 and is a soccer ref., he lives in the south and works at radio shack down in the south also. H's quite smart and seems fun. I talked to him on  the phone for a few hours last night before my mom almost killed me.. Not literally but yah. Anyway, it was fun, we talked about nothing and a lot all at the same time. Mostly the world as a whole and death and religion and life. He makes models of cars and other things. I've never seen them but I presume he's pretty good at it. He's very sweet, he must have my number written down somewhere good cause every time I call and he's busy he calls me right back just to talk. I'm not pushing it this time though, I'm going to take my time on this and see what happens. If steve's taught me anything, it would be take my time.     On another note. I don't really feel like talking much about this one, but the end of the year finished off great except for me failing social and having my science teacher basically threaten me and tell me that I will not pass Bio next year.      Also summer school, through all July I'll be talking summer school for pure Math 10, and I'm planning to get a good grade. My teacher is awesome and I feel really smart in the class lol. I get to sit under and Einstein poster, he's always been on my side; even at his state (dead as a door nail) lol      One more thing before I leave this journal entry for the sake that my creativity is drained and my headaches are starting up again. Dad called today hoping to get together and as mad as at I am at him for obvious reasons, I was quite glad to hear his voice and I really wouldn't mind seeing him this summer.     anyway that is that. I'm kind of tired.. But that was June and the beginning of July for me. Feel free to add comments if anyone is going to read this and has anything to say. I'm off to feed my cat and bird, sleep and dream. Afterall it's what I do b
