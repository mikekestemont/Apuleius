me that I was the first person he’d told about his mom.&nbsp; I asked him why and he said he didn’t know.&nbsp; We held hands and walked through the rest of the zoo.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were back in his car now.&nbsp; He looked over at me and asked if I wanted to go to the hospital with him and I couldn’t say no.&nbsp; No way in hell.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hospitals are always terrible, but it is a bit easier when the person hooked up to the machine is someone you‘ve never even met.&nbsp; It‘s less suffocating.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Mom?”&nbsp; Colin whispered as we walked over.&nbsp; Her eyes were closed and she was perfectly still except for her stomach slowly rising and falling with each breath.&nbsp; Somehow, she looked beautiful.&nbsp; Her hair was short and fuzzy and her hands were so small.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Mom, this is my pretty friend, Simone.&nbsp; She wants to go to Paris.&nbsp; I forgot to tell her that you used to live there,” Colin continued, sitting in a green leather chair next to the hospital bed.&nbsp; I stood next to him with my arms crossed.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colin got really quiet and sat back in the chair.&nbsp; After a moment, I took one of&nbsp; Bee’s hands and held it.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Colin took me to the zoo today.&nbsp; The peacocks were so excited to see us having lunch with them. You have the prettiest smallest hands. Nobody, not even the rain, has such small hands,” &nbsp;I was whispering now.&nbsp; Colin was leaning forward so he could hear me better.&nbsp; Bee barely squeezed and Colin beamed.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “She does that sometimes,” he said to me, “Mom, can you hear me?&nbsp; Squeeze my hand,” he said, taking her hand from me.&nbsp; She squeezed it and Colin leaned up to kiss her pale cheek.
We went for a walk and she held my hand a lot.  And that’s when I told her. 	“Ruby.” 	She looked at me and blinked. Her eyelashes were long and shiny and her messy black hair was in her face.  She pulled some of it behind her ear.  She put her hands in my pockets and standing there, she leaned her head against my chest. 	“I love you,” I said softly, “and I can’t let you treat me like this.” 	“Yes.  You can,” she said, never looking up at me.  And after a moment of quiet, she stepped back and walked away.  And without even thinking, I was following her again. 	And then I stopped.  I stood there and watched her walk away and she walked and walked and then she turned around.  I was in darkness and she was under the flickering streetlamp. 	“I can’t change. You have to be okay with how I am.  I’m okay with how you are.  And maybe I’m wrong.  Maybe we can be together,” she said. 	I just stood there at first.  My heart was beating so fast. So fast I didn’t know how long I could stand still.   	“Fuck you!” I hollered, before walking off in the opposite direction.  I didn’t take her h
