today, and I went out to try out the nerfed Double Strafe. I suppose I can live with the 0.3 second delay. It wasn't really that apparent to me actually. I seldom get the chance to whack multiple Double Strafes that quickly anyway.  This patch is also supposed to be the one where the Falcon attack is now of Wind element. So it can now damage Ghosts but not too great against Sohees. I can live with this too, since I don't really rely on my falcon.  I've been wondering how much it costs to go to the new maps. From what I can deduce, you take a ship from Alberta (that means $$$). The Amatsu map seems to be diagonal to the Gonryun map, so you have to walk through a field. Need to find out more about the monsters there before I go though. Anyway, I can always use my Teleport Clip to get out of danger. ^_^
I read that the Sakura patch will nerf archers and hunters yet again, by adding a 0.3 second delay to Double Strafe. Woe is me! for I rely heavily on the ability to do rapid-fire double strafes. T_T Well, I suppose it means I have to be a bit more nimble on my feet, and start running around... Or maybe I should start paying attention to traps... $_$ *sigh*  With the Sakura patch comes the Super Novice class, who supposedly can learn any of the skills of other 2nd level classes. Wonder if they can use bows? I don't suppose they can learn the quest skills such as the swordsman's walking HP recovery? How about teleporting? You can come up with some interesting builds... *deep in thought*  I'm still looking for good hunting grounds. Right now, I'm mostly dashing into Toy Factory 2, use up my SP and then dash out again before I get killed (I hate those Cruisers!). Sometimes when I'm bored I make a trip down to Morroc to hunt Hodes and Sandmans. Still, in terms of the value of drops and the damage to experience ratio I think the Toy Factory is still one of the better places. My brother tells me that if I wanna get rich I should go to Glast Heim and pick up after the bots there (and KS them too since they are mostly bots), but I can't quite survive there yet, plus I don't really like the idea of KS'ing people deliberately. ^_^
urlLink    Observng a would-be dancer going through her rites of passage in Comodo. Looks a lot like Dance Dance Revoluton to me. ^_^ It doesn't look easy though. The other hunter watching the dance with me appears to be her guild member, no doubt giving her encouragement. I hope I wasn't distracting them with my cute looks, heh. :-P
urlLink    The Kapra girl at Comodo is so cute! ^_^ She didn't say what her name was though. Now with the Sakura patch coming soon, and the new lands Amatsu and Gonryun, I wonder if there'll be more Kapra girls in R
