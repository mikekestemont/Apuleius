&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey all, Did you know 56% of couples end up divorced before there 40th year of marriage? well I’m guessing my the way things are going that my parents are gonna end up adding to that number. seriously, every frickin thing i say they have some snide remark about the other parent! take today when my dad picked me up from the barn, today you see i snapped i didn’t grin and bear it, oh no i told him off, heres how it went down me: it was to hot to ride today Dad: you couldn't ride? me: no it was to hot for presto Dad: did you drink enough water? do they have clean water at the barn me: yes they have clean water, it's not that hillbillyish Dad: My god! i was just asking a question! between you and your mother i can't even- Me:(interrupts, starting to cry) STOP IT i was joking around can i not even do that??! between the two of you&nbsp; everything i say is turned into a insult against the other parent! do you have any idea how hard that is???!!! then we were quiet for about 3 miles and then he starts Dad: so you did drink enough water did you do anything else? that’s it no, I’m sorry Meg, and no I’ll try not to make you feel like a go between in our stupid piety fights. My god really they have no clue how hard it is for me to have to be torn between the two people i love the most and have to watch their marriage deteriorate into a pile of ashes. it's scary that i have to find out the love isn't forever, that was something i really used to belie in and now.. now it's .. it's just gone so you know what? i think I’m gonna go in my room turn the radio on and forget them  You know you love me,  s
