never any question then of a space station or a moon city.  Professor: How do you mean "warned off"?  Armstrong: I can't go into details, except to say that their ships were far superior to ours both in size and technology - Boy, were they big!...and menacing! No, there is no question of a space station.  Professor: But NASA had other missions after Apollo 11?  Armstrong: Naturally - NASA was committed at that time, and couldn't risk panic on Earth. But it really was a quick scoop and back again.  According to a Dr. Vladimir Azhazha: "Neil Armstrong relayed the message to Mission Control that two large, mysterious objects were watching them after having landed near the Moon module (LEM). But this message was never heard by the public - because NASA censored it." According to a Dr. Aleksandr Kasantsev, Buzz Aldrin took color movie film of the UFOs from inside the module, and continued filming them after he and Armstrong went outside. Armstrong confirmed that the story was true but refused to go into further detail, beyond admitting that the CIA was behind the cover-up."

this is the greatness of my life. we sang, in loud drunken voices, the weird al version of "complicated", which is actually an avril song, which was playing on the radio as we sang it. no need for one person to start, we both knew what the other was thinking and sang the entire song together from the very first word. "extra cheese..."  we all make fun of all the top 40 songs on the radio, including eu's mom. when they were playing that song where they say over and over "sugar sugar how you get so fly..." she says "well duh, if she's full of sugar and sticky ooey gooey, of course she's gonna have flies all over her!" I still laugh my ass off at that one.  and, eustacia and i can never make decisions for the life of us. "should we take tomorrow off?" "I dunno...do you want to?" "I dunno...do you?" "Uhh...It'd be nice to sleep in..." "Yeah..." "So...are we gonna?" "Um..." So after work we went to walmart to find an 8 ball to solve all our indecisiveness. We didn't find o
