Houston (bustygirl@pdq.net)  Subject: Re: [ASP] ADULT FRIEND FINDER BIG RIPOFF   CoCo...thanks so much for saying that!!! I agree wholeheartedly, and am glad someone else finally said it!!! The men in my life have been of varying physical types, but I can honestly say that some of the best relationships I have had (and some of the best sex I have had) was with men who were not the most physically attractive..... a point to ponder for you guys :)  If you are plain looking that does not make you unattractive, and even if you are gorgeous....I would not want someone who did not have a good personality :)   Amber

Ripped from the flickr.com site:  "Tak showed me an old issue of Egg Magazine which he brought back from Japan. The theme is "ganguro" fashion (meaning "black face," the girls go for a tanned California look) which was quite amusing. Near the end of the issue was this, info on how to make your boobs look bigger -- I just love her pose." 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink Egg Magazine 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink robotgirl .
Well after a lengthy an often childish (on both sides) battle over the name Lindows, Microsoft has finally realized that every time they try to beat Michael Robertson in court, they're just giving him more free publicity. This is, of course, exactly what he wanted. So, to just settle the damn thing once and for all, Microsoft has bought out the Lindows name for $20 million. Of course, this works out great for Lindows... er... Linspire, as well. They basically get a $20 million investment with no dilution or strings attached -- plus a bit more publicity due to this deal.   urlLink Techdirt:Microsoft Now Owns Lindows
Apple makes me want to sell my ipod sometimes....  CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) - Apple Computer Inc. said the company is "stunned" at a move by RealNetworks Inc. to distribute software that lets customers play music from Real's song download store on Apple's iPod.  Apple said it is investigating the implications of RealNetworks' actions under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and other laws.   The company said it was "stunned that RealNetworks has adopted the tactics and ethics of a hacker to break into the iPod."   Apple said it is highly likely that Real's Harmony technology will cease to work with current and future iPods when the company updates the music player's software.    urlLink InformationWeek > Intellectual Property > Apple 'Stunned' By RealNetworks' 'Hacker' Ethics > July 29, 2004
