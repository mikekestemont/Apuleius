Very old show le... haha~~ Actually I going to sleep soon, going to school in the morning to print some stuffs coz it's cheaper over there. But just dunno why still dun wanna sleep. Yesterday I did nothing much. Laze at home, waiting for time to go to Music Clinic for choir practice. Raining some more... good time for lazing... And the practice is on diction. There's a difference between diction and dictation... anyway it's not important. As usual, my chinese diction is not good... but i'm glad that i can still remember some chinese words which some dunno... to think that i lost touch in chinese for dunno how many years...haha~~ OK.. time to sleep le... bui bui~~
As of my title... today's actually is another fine day for me... but someone twist it for me... and i suspect some of you all know who tat person is...  Today's should be a nice day... learn dancing mah... Then during in the middle of the practice... she came to me and said, "You did it again..." I said I did what. She said that I started to order the other choir members around. I said, "When did I order the people around??" She said, "Never mind, later I tell you..." From there, my mood start to drop... I kept thinking when did i order the people around. I just merely asked the choir member to gather, to listen when our dance teacher is talking. Nothing's wrong right?? Guys (from choir of course)... if you really think that I did order you people around... please tell me... I truely don't know if I had did that. Did I ever use a harsh tone to talk to people?? No.. Did I say "You better do this.. You better do that!!"?? No... I wonder if she is too sensitive already. Anyway, after that, I didn't bother to look for her to clarify the matter.. because I too sianz to talk to her... I even asked my dance teacher if I am harsh to my choir member or did I order them around. She said no ar. She said all I do is to gather the people around and to listen to her talking. That's all lor. I even asked some of my fellow choir members. They even said no lor. I guessed she's too sensitive le. Anyway, someone told me that there's one time that I did order my choir member around. And I admit that is true. For that, I got nothing to say... because I really did that mah, for the reason that I hope that all of us will have our best performance and maybe I was too eager to do so and didn't reallise myself for being demanding. For that, I'm truely sorry to my choir friends. And because of that, there's a period of time where I am quite quiet, didn't talk much to other people. Hiaz.. I dunno how to react in front of her... seeing her makes me sianz, makes me think that she got something against m
