well there's good news & bad news..   the good news:  I finished my last final paper-no more school work  ever !  the bad news:  Jacques quit Phantom Planet :(! (sniff sniff sniff!!)                               [your comfort is my silence.]
new blog template! this isn't one i made out of their templates, it's one of theirs, but it's so cute! and now blogger has all this crap like personal profiles & comments.. but i'll keep the message board link up so we can still have our argumentative long threads about nothing & plus i don't know how great the comment thing is yet.. AND i think i can put pictures in the posts. i still have to tweak it though so bear with me.  ANYWAYS! this is how i'm feeling:   urlLink  Lauryn Hill - 'That Thing (Doo Wop)'                                  woohoo!  [your comfort is my silence.]
i am so tired! today i graduated from SCILS (the school of communication) & tomorrow is the Douglass Graduation at 2pm, but there's a brunch at 10:30 am before it, too. this is all so weird... then comes partying it up this weekend like crazy-woooo! and then comes the sad part, leaving our little wyckoff street house & new brunswick completely... sniff sniff!! i know i want a change but i don't wanna not have this house to come to at ALL...and i'll miss alot of little things (& people!) here always. oh well, at least i finally finished!   ps. i chopped all my hair off!

sometimes all you need is 10 hours of bruschetta, margaritas, toenail painting, cheesy movies, and talks about children & how food is better than anything else with the girls! that's how my saturday was at christine's & it was really nice.  the night before was the last new st. party & i attained my goal of showing up to it already wasted! yay me! i was really enthusiastic that night for some reason but i had fun so that was good. everyone was so silly, at one point giant dice were being tossed about, & there was just generally a good vibe there.   those 2 days were refreshing after a horrible day last week that i won't talk about.   AHH! THURSDAY I'M GRADUATING & 1 WEEK FROM TOMORROW MOVING OUT OF NEW BRUNSWICK!                                   [your comfort is my silence.]
...to friends, rutgers, little house on wyckoff street, and all of new brunswick. i'll miss you... there were good times and bad times but i'll always have the memories from this part of my life and they are important to me. thank you.  love always, Rosanne  ps. i'll be in Portugal from may 27th to june 6th or 7th.
