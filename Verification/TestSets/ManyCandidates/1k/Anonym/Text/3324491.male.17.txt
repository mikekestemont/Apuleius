let me kiss you so...
I got your letter today, well I kind of knew I'd get your letter today since you'd have to send it by first class and if it was sent on Monday it would be here by Tuesday. I found out that Gemma is a lesbian btw, she kissed the pictures of you, I had to restrain her. I even read her the whole letter, it made me smile lots and has done a lot to placate worries that have been growing since you left. I'm really worried that you may be hurt or traumatised last night, I couldn't sleep cos I was worried that you might be. Well again the lineup for today is sod all but I had a dream last night, and in it I was looking for you, and I caught the bus to Gloucester and then when I got to Gloucester I realised that you wouldn't be there because you were on D of E... but I looked everywhere anyway... and then I woke up at like 9... which is the earliest I've got up all week... well since Saturday. I'm gonna go watch the video for Vindicated cos it's an amazing song... oh dear Gemma is trying to call your phone again... well she headbutted the phone cos I accidentally bumped her over with the keyboard... and that's how I'm going to interpret it. I'm trying very hard not to call you cos if I do I just feel more lonely cos you aren't there.
Raa, I missed you today and again you've only been gone for... well 24 hours now. Me and Gemma stayed in bed until 2 o'clock but she slept in till 4 cos she's missing you too. I've had a very lazy day cos I can't bring myself to do anything. I came online with the express purpose of blogging and talking to people but can't be bothered to talk to people. You'll have no idea how much reading your e-mail made me smile, well actually it was predominantly the picture of you which made me smile, cos I was in a downish mood and I saw you and it was like YAY! :) I haven't left any messages on your answering machine yet because it's going to make me miss you more, because I usually call till I get through to you... and this time I won't be able to. I was speaking to Alex on Thursday about slitting and she said that it wasn't a natural human response, I managed to disprove that notion, which doesn't mean I approve of it, au contraire I am very opposed to it, but it's comprehendable to me. Basically when people are stressed or depressed they need to displace this feeling into something else, now slitting is a physical pain. People have said why not do exercise? In exercise you push yourself as hard as you can till you hit pain barriers, similar to a degree no? Pain is how we push back our boundaries and stop ourselves bouncing off t
