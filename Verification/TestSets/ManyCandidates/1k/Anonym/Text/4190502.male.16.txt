your own country need to hear, we dont even have travel out of our own state or even zip code to find people who need to hear about God. That still did not answer my question on how I could influence someone. I am always to scared, and when the chance is there, I blow it because I get embarresed. I am not really embarred about what I beleive, but embarresed on what people will think of me.   Audio Adrenaline - Hands and Feet Lyrics   An image flashed across my TV screen Another broken heart comes into view I saw the pain, and I turned my back Why can't I do the things I want to? I am willing yet I'm so afraid You give me strength When I say  I wanna be Your hands I wanna be Your feet I'll go where You send me I'll go where You send me I'll be Your hands I'll be Your feet I'll go where You send me I'll go where You send me And I try, yeah I try To touch the world like You touched my life An I'll find my way To be Your hands  I've abandoned every selfish thought I've surrender everything I've got You can have everything I am And perfect everything I'm not I am willing, I'm not afraid You give me strength When I say...  This is the last time I turn my back on You From now on I'll go out Send me where You want me to I finally have a mission I promise I'll complete I don't need excuses When I am Your hands and feet I am Your hands and feet  Anyway tonight was work....again....blah. I went it at 4:00 because my mom and I had to pick up Kerriann. O' what fun. T.J. was already there playing the organ with MT (maddam truffle). Tonight was buffet and they had Macaroni and Cheese. Oh I could just here the hallelujah chorus. So when all the residents were done I got me some mac and cheese and roasted chicken (dark meat incase you are wondering), and for dessert I had mocha chip icecream with hot fude (I created a hot fudge explosion in the beaumont kitchen woops!, but i cleaned it up...hehe... Well I am gonna go... TTY guys later
Today me and my brother cleaned out his room yet again, or what he calls his newly refinished lair. It looked as if a bomb had exploded in it. At 4:00 we had to go to work but i got to see maddam truffle and thats always fun **truffle**. I brought her an egg! and a pad of butter.  It always annoys me when people think they are incharge, even though they arnt. Well anyway my brother was playing the piano and Andre said he was not allowed to. It makes me mad why should he always tell people what to do? But then again we always have to remember that even though certain people in our life annoy us God loves them t
