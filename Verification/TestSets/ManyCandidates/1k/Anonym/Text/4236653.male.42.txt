Suffice it to say I was good at what I did and I had self-respect and the respect of others (well, a little respect at least).  What do I do now? I deliver newspapers. Yep, that's it. The pay is pretty good that's for sure, but it's certainly a  HUGE  step down the ladder. But really, it does free me up to do whatever I want to do during the day...though that's not good enough for my wife's family. They want me to go and get a "real" job in addition to the newspaper thing. Yet they said nothing to my wife when she sat around on her ass playing Everquest when we lived in Illinois.  So now that's where I am. I totally and completely hate it here. No, that's not right. Hate is too weak a word. I  LOATH  it here. The only thing that is keeping me alive (that is, keeping me from slashing my wrists...and that's not an exaggeration) is my son. I have no feelings anymore for my wife really. She'll never know how much she ripped my life and my son's life apart to make herself feel happy. She said she would make it up to me, but that's really a pipe dream. As I said before, I've become a non-person. She says she loves me and she smiles and snuggles up to me in bed (and that's it really), but nothing more. She does nothing for me, doesn't go out of her way to do anything nice for me. She didn't even say "happy birthday" or even acknowledge me on my birthday. Yet when her sister or parents have a birthday...well, everything stops and we have to go to dinner and blah blah blah. Now, dear reader you may think that I myself am also to blame...what did I do for her you may ask? On  HER  birthday I bought her a cake, candles, decorated the apartment with happy birthday balloons and banners...I didn't get squat nor even a "happy birthday".  There's so much to get off my chest I don't even know where to begin...I just scratched the surface here. I'm in a place where I have zero friends, I don't know anyone here and I'm surrounded by people that dislike me. Her parents have  NEVER  liked me and it's been made worse since all this happened. They don't listen to anything I have to say nor take any advice in the areas where I know a little. I'm just a joke to them all. My wife has a huge support system with her family here but I have nothing. I have no one to turn to, no where to go. I am on nobody's side because nobody is on my side. The only refuge I have now is drinking myself into a stupor to where I don't have to deal with anything.  Basically I'm 42 years old now and am just waiting to die. I'm about 150 pounds overweight and I drink almost daily...so death is just around the corner for m
