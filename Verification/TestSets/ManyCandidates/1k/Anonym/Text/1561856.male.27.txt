sweet, just in case you have to eat them.  Always read stuff that will make you look good if you die in the middle of it.  Drive carefully. It's not only cars that can be recalled by their maker.  Eat a live toad in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you for the rest of the day.  If you can't be kind, at least have the decency to be vague.  If you lend someone $20, and never see that person again, it was probably worth it.  It may be that your sole purpose in life is simply to serve as a warning to others.  Never buy a car you can't push.  Never put both feet in your mouth at the same time, because then you don't have a leg to stand on.  Nobody cares if you can't dance well. Just get up and dance.  The early worm gets eaten by the bird, so sleep late.  When everything's coming your way, you're in the wrong lane.  Birthdays are good for you; the more you have, the longer you live.  You may be only one person in the world, but you may also be the world to one person.  Some mistakes are too much fun to only make once.  Don't cry because it's over; smile because it happened.  We could learn a lot from crayons: some are sharp, some are pretty, some are dull, some have weird names, and all are different colors but they all have to learn to live in the same box.  A truly happy person is one who can enjoy the scenery on a detour.  Happiness comes through doors you didn't even know you left open.  Have an awesome day, and know that someone has thought about you today....

I need a better system, a system to keep track of things to do at and outside of work, and&nbsp;ideas that just pop in my head. There has yet a day to pass where where I don't come up with something that i'd like to do, and I tell myself I need to write it down somewhere, but i don't. It's like saying i need to remind myself to remind myself, but i don't be cause i didn't have a way to remind myself in the first place. Argh. I wouldn't say that my life is so chaotic that i don't get anything done, i just know i could do more and maybe even save myself&nbsp;some money&nbsp;if i had a system. (heck, i was 1 week late in paying my property taxes!! i couldnt believe it!) So with that, i'm gonna take a look at   urlLink  David Allen's    system. I've heard some   urlLink  good things    about it, so its worth a try i suppose. Now let me make myself a reminder for that.... ;-)
rumours of my demise have been greatly exaggerated. ;-) I just got back from a road trip through the Rockies and Calgary. Now its back to the daily g
