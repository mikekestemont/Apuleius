DIE and reorganize with their wealth from oil.  Oh, if One-Term Sr. would have told W what he done figgered out!  We should be proud of our reluctance to kill civilians to advance our cause, keep our guard up on our own soil (cavity searches at the airport are a bit excessive), travel judiciously, and live with the risks.  Occasionally we need to keep an evil dictator in line and extend some humanitarian gesture, on the scale of the Kosovo invasion, which was effective for a mere couple billion dollars. Bush gave a rational, impassioned and effective speech to the UN as to why the world needed to restrain the mad Huessein.  I listened to the whole thing on NPR and I was impressed.  (No tongue in cheek.)  I felt that multi-national (not unanimous) financial and military support was ours but for a little patience.  A more sober approach, with a sensible budget was assured.  The radical Muslims's hate for the US could be partially absorbed by more significant allies than hapless England.  Still nothing would have improved in the long run, but my son and grandson and great grandson and their generations would have been a hundred-odd billion less in the red.  But Bush's spurs jangled, and he exercised the "clear and present danger" clause in international law and declared war unilaterally.  He said "weapons of mass destruction" and "post 9/11" about a million times, with that steely-eyed, I'm-serious, nobody's-home glint in his eye, and you all bought it.  Okay, I bought it, too, until he asked for $60,000,000,000.  Holy crap!  And on top of that, after no WMDs were being found, and everyone realized that Osama bin Laden was whose blood we wanted, our premise for war (presto-change-o) shifted to a humanitarian effort, oh, and we need $60,000,000,000 MORE for the blessed innocent souls in Iraq.  A post 9/11 $120,000,000,000 humanitarian gesture of futility.  Started by lying as to the premise.  We cannot afford to let this Yalie coke-snorter turned Texas hillbilly  run our country anymore.  Say what you want about Clinton, and he deserves a lot of his so awful it's almost comical reputation, and I voted for him and I'm a little embarrassed... but I think I'd vote for somebody capable of shooting porn flicks (for crying out loud) in the Oval Office, if he would spend money judiciously, inspire confidence in corporate and industrial America, and guide us to unprecidented prosperity.  That's what a president does. The polls are pretty sophisticated now days, hopefully not as sophisticated as they pretend to be.  I saw an outlandish projection that Bush lose the popular vote again and be relected.  Chilling and plausible.  Please, those of you who live in states where Bush or Kerry could win:  GET MAD AS HELL AND DON'T TAKE IT ANY MORE!!!!  I live in Oklahoma and we're a lost cause.  I will do my part, because I acknowledge the concept of noble failure.  I also acknowledge that my countrymen in other states will determine the  outcome of our country.  Pray reason reigns e
