calling me for closure (or what he sees as closure). I tried to calm down a little bit, and we started running the show. that made me feel a little better. it made me feel a little better until i was sitting with Dani and Christine, and they gave me another note. it was folded up and it said Cristin (hehe he cant spell christine right)in aarons handwriting. my stomach just dropped. i was like not again!!! They told me i absolutely could not let aaron know that they had given me that note. dani actually said "put it in your pocket! do not read it until you are home safe in your bedroom and you have locked the door!!!" so of course, at break i went in the bathroom and read it. even after jack had told me not to. i couldnt help myself. Dani and Christine came in the bathroom with me. As i read it, my eyes widened and i could barely stifle a scream. Dani and Christine were trying to shush me...it wasnt working too well. i counted to ten, went back into the rehersal hall, and sat down next to Jack. I thought i was saying "Jack, i read the note even though you told me not to" but i guess he couldnt understand me that well. "whats the matter, did he say something?" i told him that i read the note again. "Why'd you read it, jules?" i didnt know why. i said i had to read it, but i think i was too exhausted to feel suspense. i probubly would have if i was feeling normal. i gave the note to jack and told him to read it but told him to make sure aaron didnt see him. we did ACT II. when that was over jack beckoned to me. he said "is this really bothering you" and i nodded my head. then he asked me what i want. i asked him what he meant. he just said "what do you want?" and i said that i dont know. Then we had to go over to the trailors b/c Annie Get Your Gun had to rehearse, and they're a mainstage show so they have the right of way if you will. we sat down in the trailor and jack told me that it looks to him like aaron is talkin about all this depressing stuff like how bad his life is, but then he sees him laughing and acting normal, when im the one whose upset and putting emotion into it. he said he's trying to put me on a guilt trip and i need to just not think about it. then we ran the last scene and worked out curtain call. im inbetween jack and nick, and when the other line is bowing jack keeps using me as an arm rest. lol. he's great. maybe nothing will happen with aaron today...maybe... today we have the closing ceremony at school. next year we r gonna b eighth graders, and rule the school...hehehe. revenge! y
