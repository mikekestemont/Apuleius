good time with alfredo....who is good and kind and (as mentioned prior) lots of fun....and hanging out with someone you feel that comfortable with makes you realize that you can leave the country, move away, take on a new life, and still you remain the same....you never lose yourself....so what this means is i am back to late nights and g&t......i don't mind because in the end it's not about partying....it about people and relationships and good friendships and i am happy to know the people i have met here.....even if it means i have crawl in the door at seven am....tonight was my night off and we went down to the coast, sat on the water and ate fantastic italian.....and why?....because i said that i really missed that sort of thing given that i work six nights a week...so yes, things are good here and i think i will miss some people....and i have built some memories....things to look back on and smile about....my own little film.....and that's a good thing....  in addition, larissa and my mother left for miami this morning.....i hope they have a fantastic time and it's all too bad that i saw so little of larissa while we were both here but work and dengae (sp?) fever seemed to get in the way.....sucks eh?.....  alright, i'm off to smoke a ciggy.....find  my dog (wonderful loyal beast that he is) and go to bed.....ciao
good morning...i have been up for about fifteen minutes and have had two grand moments of stupidity....first of all, i got up and walked around the house looking for my mother, my sister, my father....anyone....nobody is here....nada....and i thought "that's weird".....and then i realized it's sunday....of course they are not here....they're at church.....secondly, i woke up thinking i forgot the two bottles of wine i bought at work last night in alfredo's car.....but they were nicely on the kitchen counter....how can i simply forget that?.....the answer....gin and tonic....i think....so....i've been out two nights in a row with alfredo who is one of my bosses and a good friend of ben.....and it's fun....alfredo is kind, funny, generous and ridiculously dirty-minded.....and he has rob dokter syndrome....he gives everyone the impression that they are, at that moment, the most important person in his life....good stuff eh?....we went out to tutu tango on friday and he took good care of me....shooed the yucky men away and observed the cute ones with me.....last night we were at mambo....saw a lot of the same faces we saw at tutu and ran into a couple (dick and petra) we had seen the night before....so the four of us had a good time, good conversation, good fun....i enjoyed myself....  this evening the boys i work with (juan and rugerio) are coming over to eat....i hope my head can handle it today....  uhm....  dames, ik bel jullie over een uurtje....1 uur hier, 7 uur daar...dan is juudje klaar met werken.....  r, bedankt voor je sms....ik ben precies hetzelfde....maak je geen zorg....bbq klinkt leuk....had er bij willen zijn....doe de jongens de groeten van m
