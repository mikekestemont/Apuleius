how God takes care of them... But there are so many times when I don't take my heavenly Father's blessing into account... I have it all... A family who loves me, friends who care about me, a church that is so wonderful that I don't want to leave, and opportunities to let my light shine for the world to see, but I don't because I'm scared someone may tell me what I don't want to hear.  So what's next? When will I stop repressing the blessings that God has given to me, and start sharing the blessing with others the wonderful gifts that have been given to me... Hopefully, I will wake each day to give and find new blessings that are poured out. Only time will tell what's next in my life... Hopefully God will let me see a glimmer of what is next to come... What is next that He is going to teach me about His ultimate love for me and His children.... Eyes up, Mel~
So I hear there is this thing called time. Supposedly we are suppose to manage it somehow... But it seems to me that no matter how much I try to manage it, it always gets away from me. I'm starting to think that this is like a teenager... The more you try to restrain and manage it, the more it will try and run away from the constraints that are put around it... Anyone agree? Or a better comparison would be that I am Willey coyote, and time is the Road Runner... No matter how many times I use my acme company gadgets, there is always the backfire of what is a fool-proof plan. I am gradually learning that no matter what we plan for, how we plan for it, or the intensity we place on our well timed plans, God always has a different plan in mind. Eventually, I start to see a pattern. I make a plan, God changes it. So I wonder if I make a plan that I would never think would happen.... Would God change that plan? Or would He allow me to go through the stupidity of trying to "get one-up on God" and then just laugh at me later... Yup... I think He would just laugh at me later... LATER~ Mellie L~
There are very few things in life that cause me not to be happy when I think about it. But one thing is for sure... An epiphany made me extremely happy this weekend. As I was going through my planner, I realized I only had 2 mods (2 sets of 18 day classes) left in my schooling... Which means I will be done with classes this upcoming September. So to all of you suckers who laughed at me because I was going to school all summer and would be miserable.... HA! To you! As everyone else is going back to school... I will be starting my new job, working in the medical field... THAT, my friends, is what has made me happy today. Peace, M
