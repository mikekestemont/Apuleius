about 6 weeks of experiments to do when I'm the most stressed I've ever been. They chose to send it in July, when everybody I've tried to contact about it is off on holiday. They chose to send it in internal mail so that I received it at 6pm, when there was nobody at work, and no way I could contact them about it. I'm really pissed off. I have issues with what the letter's actually saying, and suspicions that the reason I've received it is because of the situation involving my supervisor moving away. I understand that they're covering their backs, and that they're just doing their jobs, but I feel like I'm having to sort out all this crap and plead with them to allow me access to the library when surely the point of the university at this stage is to help enable me to write up, not to add more stress to an already overloaded brain.
I'm having another emotional day. I'm afraid I've been sobbing in the office for over an hour, and then wasting some time looking for hints on helping me write up. There were many many websites and articles, some with very complex models of thesis writing!?! which I scanned and then realised that It'd take 3 months to decide how I was going to do it if I read the whole article.  urlLink This one  I liked though. It made me chuckle a bit, and it's nice to know that not feeling human is normal.  (will substitute Belgian beer with Mexican beer though ;) )
Norge   well I've had a hectic time the last few days, but (apart from living in other peoples pockets) I had a fantastic time.  I loved Norway. I will have to go back so that I can see more of it (I'll have to get some more money first, the food and drink is very very expensive).  More importantly of course it was my friend's wedding (and the first one I'd ever been to) It was great. I had tears in my eyes as I saw her walking down the aisle with a nervous smile and eyes fixed straight ahead. Everything was beautiful. The weather, the church, the dress, the meal (2 main courses of reindeer!), the speeches, the guests... I could go on. I left (and I don't think I was alone in this) to go to bed feeling happy and content, knowing that 2 people who should be together were, and that the world is sometimes a very lovely place. (soppy I know, but both bride and groom are great people and deserve all the happiness in the world)
Prozac in Drinking Water  Thanks to  urlLink badly dubbed boy  for drawing my attention to  urlLink this  I have a strangely paranoid thought that this isn't the result of so many people being prescribed the drug, but may actually be deliberate. Perhaps the government are spiking our drinking water to make us forget about the war in Iraq etc... Anyway, back to my book. I'm reading nineteen eighty f
