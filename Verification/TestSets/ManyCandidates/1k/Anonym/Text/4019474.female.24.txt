the unfamiliar.  I am so lucky.  In a way, he is, to quote our favorite beer-drinking National Artist Nick Joaquin, "my Manila".  He stands for home and for everything that is dear to me.  The familiar smell of his cheek - a mixture of cigarette smoke and freshly scrubbed skin - is a sweet reminder that I am right where I should be.  It's an intoxicating smell, one which reaches in my chest and pulls out my heart, leaving me raw and vulnerable and completely, stupidly in love.    I love him and I love home.  They stand for the same thing.  The same overwhelming scents and the same comforting touch.  How am I going to get by without either one of both?
From the second floor where my bedroom is, I can hear everything.  Too close to the ground and facing the street.  No longer do I need a nightlight.  All I have to do is flick the switch and my room is flooded with the yellow glow of the lamp post from across.  I have three windows.  Should I decided to keep them shut, then I am closed off to the world outside, the proverbial catterpillar lying safe in her cocoon.  But I like to know what's going on.  It makes me feel safe.  So I unlock all the hatches and pull the glass windows up, and the sounds roll in like a tidal wave.     Right below my bedroom window, there is a grotesquely overweight black lady yelling in French at her toddler.  The little boy's face contorts into a disfigured display of emotion as he screams in between choked sobs and pinched phrases.  "C'est..hic...Mama...hic...no, mama.."   Tried words spill randomly from his tiny mouth, already covered in tears and mucus.  The fat lady continues to yell.  At night, I lay awake listening to the howl and whine of the numerous firetrucks and ambulances skittling up Amsterdam Avenue.  Each truck with a destination; why so many of them are needed in the dead of the night I have no clue, but people call for them anyway.  I suppose accidents are most likely to happen when you anticipate rest.  The sirens wail with conviction, then fade as the trucks extend into the distance.    Some other nights, I hear the audible murmurs of people conversing in the room below.  I can never make out the words.  They are often muffled versions of what I imagine to be arguments, confessions, damned invitations.  I try to make out their faces by tracing a picture in my head with the tones and melodies of each uttered word.  They seem lovely.  A drunken laugh, a worried cough.  People moving things in a lamp-lit street, moving and shuffling, arranging and rearranging.  Everyone in this city coming and going.  These are the sounds I will have to live with for 10 months of my life.
I got the semi-bigger room with the three windows.  Second floor, facing the street.  Ha. 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink room with a view 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink wasteofwhine .
