wuickly realizing that we don't know how to play.  I can remember bits and pieces but there are still a lot of holes.  I tried looking for the rules online here - but they can't be found.  Just second edition rules or universal first edition rules - no 1994 rule sets to be found.  So Justin - send them here buddy... we need them!
Things that piss me off about living with Reynold: 1) He doesn't post responses to blog entry contests; 2) He takes all the covers; and 3) He watches Crouching Tiger in dubbed English.  That's all - oh and we're having an apartment warming/ren's birthday party next Saturday (15th) - stop by and drink yourself stupid...
Reynold and I are now connected to the internet.  I haven't seen my roomie in over a day now and I really don't know when he's moving in... but we've got two computers hooked up to the net now - it should be all good from here on in.  Just to note that my back is still fucked up - especially after ren and andrew put my bed in the closet and I had to pull it out.  That hurt.  Arranging the living room so that all we can have decent conversation with guests and not around boxes.  That hurt too.  Filling the fridge with beer and emptying the scotch bottles.  Didn't hurt so much.  Email me if you need the phone number and address.

I just want to see how this Ecto software works for desktop blogging.  I don't have to go to Blogger everytime.  It'll be useful for when I'm stuck on dialup and don't want to clunk my way along.
urlLink From a Neil Gaiman speech:  "I've learned over the years that everything is more or less the same amount of work, so you may as well set your sights high and try and do something really cool."  He also talks about how comics are an industry of cranky old Jews
Back from a major hiatus and now sans ads this is discojivesuper5.  I use this as a place for interesting links and such.  Other DJS5ers do other things.  At least they have in the past.  Personally I'd like to see more blogging about Big Loud's new foray into university and musical exploits from that Alverstone drummer sometimes known as the Poor Choices.
