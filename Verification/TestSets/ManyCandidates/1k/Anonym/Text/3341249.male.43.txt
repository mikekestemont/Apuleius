I thought I needed a new coat!
Bob this one's for you.
A couple of wildflower pictures from Glacier
Spotted this church along the way.
Day six or something like that I believe. I am sure the spelling in these posts are ghastly, but bear with me. I am in Kalispell, Montana. I found a coffe shop about 5 blocks away that has internet. Pictures tommorrow I promise. I've been in and around Glacier National Park for the last three days. There is still plenty of snow up in the mountains. Steve, not as much as we seen in Rocky Mountain National that time, but a lot. There are so many waterfalls here that is on believable. I've seen about a dozen mountain goats since I've been here and a couple of eagles as well. No pictures of either of them. I did get some pictures of some bighorn sheep today and a couple of elk also. We had our orientation for the seminar tonight. We had to sign a paper saying that if we get ate by the grizzly bear it's out own damn fault for being stupid, or soemthing like that. Can't wait to start shooting tommorrow. We are working with a couple of the better known photographers around, so it should be great learning experince.  Okay, get out your maps... Find St. Ignace... Find Kalispell... Look at highway 2... Pretty cool huh? Only one road to get here... Of course it's two thousand miles of one long boring road, but it gets you here. Any one reading this?
Well, I finally got somewhere that I can log on and update this, although no pictures yet. I am in East Glacier, Montana. I spent about 4 hours in the park this afternoon. It was kinda of wet and gloomy, but I went on a couple of hikes and took a few pictures anyway. It is very beautiful here as one would expect. I have driven about 2300 miles since I left Fremont last Friday. I met another guy from Michigan here today that took highway 2 out here also. He sumed up the eastern 3/4's of this state in this manner, "I hate Montana. I don't ever want to see another blade of grass... ever." Now I   know where all that certified Black Angus Beef comes from, and yes unlike like my friend I just mentioned, I will eat it again. Bob, there are mexican resturants galore out here, so travel without fear. About the most interesting thing that happened on the way out here was in Wisconson. A bald eagle swooped down right beside the Jeep and grabbed up a mouse or some other rodent that was having a bad day. I also seen the grill that cooked the world's largest hamburger, and drove through the geographical center of North America. Don't worry, I have pictures! Tommorrow I move to my "permanent" spot, at least for a week. Hopefully I can find some internet hookup and upload some pictures. See ya.
I haven't left yet, but you've found the right place. Keep checking h
