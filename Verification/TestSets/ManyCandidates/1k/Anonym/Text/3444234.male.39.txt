work in the IBM Office in Seattle. We're writing the Certification Exams for the  IBM Certified Sales Specialist - xSeries  certification, which is quite a hard job. The exam is used worldwide to qualify sales people to sell the IBM xSeries servers and ... oh you don't really care about this do you? Anyway .. I'm looking forward to getting back home already. We have our big Bun scan on the 27th. Fingers crossed.
Well at  long last we had our Wedding Reception at the  urlLink Brisbane Marriott  on Saturday night, 10 July. It was exactly 3 months after our wedding ceremony, but we got to share and celebrate with all the family and friends who weren't around for the ceremony because it&nbsp;had been&nbsp;a surprise.   A truly excellent night - Jo had organised candles, lighting, and draping on the ceiling of the room so it looked beautiful. We had about 80 guests on&nbsp;nine tables which were themed as the Solar System - "Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", etc etc to "Pluto".   Jo and I stayed the Friday night in the hotel using some of my Marriott points, and on Saturday they upgraded us to the Presidential Suite of the hotel - very nice! Also our parents and many of our friends took the opportunity to stay in the hotel for Saturday night so I'm sure many of them had a great time. We certainly had the night of our lives!   Our MC,  urlLink Calvin Bradshaw , had to rush to hospital on the Saturday morning (poor Calvin and Mae, we're so sorry that they missed the event) but thankfully Jo's younger brother Tim stepped in at the eleventh hour and filled in doing a fantastic and professional job. I feel guilty because I think he was so stressed out on Saturday that he didn't get to enjoy the night! But thank you Tim!    We had a slideshow going through the dinner showing pictures of our lives together and in particular our times at Strathvea and our Wedding Ceremony. The speeches were all heartfelt: my dad Bruce Waite spoke and welcomed Jo to the family, Jo's father John Pike gave a great speech and toast, Tim Pike spoke lovingly of his sister, and Jo spoke and proposed a toast to absent friends. we cut our wedding cake which was a very nice white chocolate mud cake, and that was distributed as dessert.   Then I did my speech, which of course culminated in our now customary surprise announcement - that we were pregnant, and  Bun  is due in December. I introduced my sister  urlLink Jen , who performed one of her new original songs  "Love Comes Falling"  while Jo and I danced our bridal waltz. Beautiful. Finally the DJ started and we danced to the songs from our youth in the 80's and 90's until they kicked us out of the room. Jo and I went upstairs and just talked until about 2 AM, we were so buzzed up.   Photos of the magical evening will be available soon, when I get around to organising them! &
