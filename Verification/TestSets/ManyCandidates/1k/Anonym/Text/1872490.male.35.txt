up there are stairways made from someone carving into the rockface. Along the way there are a few little shelters with people selling drinks and snacks. Everyone smiles as we go by. There are oxen, lots of goats and monkeys. Every so often, Ravi makes sure that I want to continue up to the cave Temple which, of course, I do. We get there right before it really starts to rain and three monkeys and two twin wolf like dogs are standing guard along with a young guy who looks like Kobe Bryant.      The temple is very small and as you go in there are stairs leading up to a shrine of Ganesha. Same as most of the one's I have seen, you look through a doorway and there is a kind of ramp leading up to a decorated Genesha. Ravi, does his ritual and then we go to the right where there is a small passage way that you have to duck and climp up to. As you turn the corner, there is a leg sizzed hole in the rock. We look at it and go through to the other side and back around and out. I knew nothing abut the hole or touching the water but when we got out, a 69 year old man who had traveled 500 kilometers on his pilgrimage, asked me if I touched the water. I didn't understand but Ravi translated. Ravi told him that we didn't even try and he increduously sent us back in. Ravi, went and I wasn't sure why he was going or what was going on and he motioned for me to go, go!      We went back in and Ravi reach down shoulder length into the hole and pulled out some water which he drank. Then I did the same. Still not realizing the significance, we went back out. When the man, his friend and Kobe heard that we had gotten the water, they were very happy. We were blessed. They said that one person can reach in and get nothing and another right after might touch and drink the water. Its up to Ganesha whether you are a good person and if you are worthy. There were times when no one touched the water for 35 years and another time for 50 years. I was going to be very successful they said. After the rain stopped, on the way down the hill, Ravi said, "It's all real. God decides if you get the water. This is very good for the production." "Yeah", I said, thinking to myself about how seriously he and the others took this and that it was all sweet and harmless enough. No reason to reveal myself as a non-believer and whatever gives you hope is fine with me. The fact that they believed it and that it was an amazing experience was good enough for me.  News of our triumph travelled back to Shandilya Creations and everyone was impressed and happy that this had happened. Me too. I'll always have the story to t
