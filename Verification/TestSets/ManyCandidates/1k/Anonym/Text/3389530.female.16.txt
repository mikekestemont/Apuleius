mistake when he decided to go to war, although to be fair i do think saddam hussein needed to be removed from power. by going against the feeling of the british people (and ignoring the largest protest against war britain has ever seen) he made his position as representative of the british people untenable. i do feel sorry for him, as i feel he is in a sense caught between a rock and a hard place. he cannot afford to lose the favour of the usa, as with its transformation into moral guardian of the world it could be a very useful ally.   oh, and i've forgotten about the environmental impact on our physical surroundings of all this activity. the polar ice caps are melting at a faster rate than they ever have, america, possibly the world's greatest producer of carbon dioxide emissions has refused to sign the kyoto treaty, oil production is being increased to lower prices (so we can all fulfil our petrol-fuelled lifestyles) and fossil fuels are running out at a dangerous rate. global warming is becoming a bigger threat than ever.  as i said, the world's an interesting place nowadays. apologies for the rant :)
ah, i'm back. i haven't posted because i didn't feel like it... and then i couldn't be bothered... i'm like this with diaries too. i've been on deviantART way too much lately. i watch all these people so whenever i come online i've got like 50 messages waiting for me... bah.  exams are going well. i have four left, two history and two business studies. my revision's been pretty much non-existent, but i manage just fine anyway, being a genius and all 0_o we had maths calculator paper, and a history paper today. history rocked, i knew all the answers, but writing solid for two hours destroyed my knuckles... ah well. shoulda earned me my predicted a*. i hope.  life's been good. room's still tidy, zapp is back to his frog-murdering self, i handed in my note which means i'll be able to start drumming lessons next year (can't wait!!) and i've finally found what i want to do at uni. i've been umming and aahing for a while. for a bit i thought i'd like to do german, cos i really enjoy it and i'm good at it, but the same goes for economics (well, to be fair, i don't do it yet, but i can almost guarantee i'm going to find it fascinating). i was looking through the oxford prospectus, having already checked cambridge's, and i saw this course: ppe. philosophy, politics and economics. wouldn't that be fascinating? well, i think so. i really  really  want to do that. gotta get into oxford though. they ask for aaa or aab, which i should be able to manage, i hope (lol, at my last parents' evening, my english teacher said i should go to oxbridge. i smiled and nodded, then afterwards, i go to my dad, "where's oxbridge??")  anyway. i'll be off. perhaps i'll post again in a few more months :
