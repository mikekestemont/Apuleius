gain enough favor for the mighty armplates to replace my simple Acrylia Studded Leather I've been wearing for quite some time now.  If ever shall we meet may it be as brothers, and not as enemies. Ziggur
Two nights ago I woke from camp, and found Akcron peddling her Temperance inside the Plane of Knowledge, she said she was seeking an adventure, later while we were waiting for more people to join our adventuring party, an old friend Shimara arrived and wanted to also adventure. We joined together, not to do Mistmoore Dungeons, but instead the frightful Miragul Dungeons. I had only been there once before, and was not prepared for what was to happen.  We arrived and picked up a ranger and a Shadowknight, and proceeded into battle inside Everfrost dungeons. The first few rooms of the dungeon were filled with spiders and bears. Easy enough for our team to handle. But as we grew further back, we ran across Magic wielding goblins. The room we originally encountered these nasty threats seemed a basic room, with 1 goblin in the middle, and a couple on the outskirts that seemed far enough away from the central goblin that I should be able to shoot and arrow at him and have him run my way. Being low on Divine Energy I could not pacify the others in the room.  When I shot the goblin, all of the friends in that room proceeded to chase our party down. Our Druid attempted to evacuate us, but died while trying frantically to memorize the spell. then Akcron Died, and I decided it was best to beat a retreat. Most of us made it out alive. I ran back in to Rez Akcron, who then rezzed our Druid Shimara. We went and attempted again, since we had killed 3 of the beasts last time it seemed safer, so I began to pacify the room, but 2 spotted me on the side before I could pacify them, and they gave chase, again about 5 goblins mowed me down in seconds, and took the rest of the party.  We were determined though, even with our Ranger ducking out on us, I died again later on in the dungeon as the mage's in the dungeon were powerful. We eventually overspent our safe time in the Dungeon without completing our tasks and left a failure. My Shaman friend Kretais swore not to go back there, but I told him that we should not let thse set backs prevent us from these endeavours. I suggested we go back for vengeance, when properly outfitted with a Enchanter to assist us. As I know Ellektra, the finest enchanter I've met, would easily have prevented all the carnage that took place. She is wise, and powerful, and we definitely appreciate it when she is with us.  I laid down camp with a heavy head, and I only hope the next battle I go into, turns out better than the last.  If ever shall we meet may it be as friends, and not as enemies, Z
