for the UNDERGROUND?  All will be revealed...all will be told...nothing will be held back! The UNDERGROUND is coming.
god damn...hail! Marble sized...but hail!  I went over to my nutsy neighbor's tonight while he and his buds were working on their motorcycle...and it HAILED it's ass off! Richie accidentally let the dog out, and she ran right back into the garage.   It was TOO DAMN COOL! DAMN I love it here!
Have you ever had an experience where someone who once really mattered suddenly starts to hate you...and you have  no idea  why? It used to really bother me, but over time, you just stop caring, and eventually stop wondering why.
I love this political season. I love seeing each side fire it's salvos at the other....it's so hilarious! As Bush said to the Iraqi resistance "Bring it on!"  ...by the way, why the hell did he say that? I sure am glad he is praying to his god for  "less casualties."....hey, George, how about NO casualties? And speaking of casualties, have you noticed how the pentagoners are now starting to report "insurgent" deaths alongside American troop deaths? It's like..."Well, they got 8 of our soldiers, but we got 40 of them!!"...give me a fucking break.  "God told me I'd be President" - George W. Bush "God told me to kill my children" - Deanna LaJune Laney  ...I love election season!
Just 18 more days and I'll be celebrating my 1 year anniversary of leaving Va and moving to CO. I would be so bold as to say that it was the best decision I've made...ever.  Life is " urlLink Rearranged "...it's Eric's turn!  .  BTW, the Underground is still coming, and will reveal all...stay tuned.
Today started out pretty normally for a summer Friday. I got up, got Richie up, and Sean was "already up." I took a shower, got Rich dressed, packed his lunch for his field trip (since school is out, his daycare has trips), had my coffee and got ready to leave.  At this point, I noticed that the weather was perfect (again) so my bud Bruce and I decided to ride the  urlLink scoots  in. So, I loaded up the Richster and drove him to daycare and me to work. This damn  urlLink Yamaha  of mine if perfect for this place, and the gas mileage (about 70mpg) can't be beat.   We picked the kids up in the afternoon and had a little ride home...the kids absolutely love  urlLink these things , and so do the adults :-)  At any rate, a nice Friday!
OK folks...this is the start of YET ANOTHER website overhaul. It is prompted by my decision not to renew my domain. I never have the time to update pics and such anymore, so why bother with the trouble!     I'll be putting up a basic site soon, and emails will go out with the address. I also hope to put more up here (yeah, right). Oh, and forget about the UNDERGROUND....I had to give up on it, too much work.
There are a few changes going on around the website. Stay t
