spoke to a Luke.    Today, I called Luke 3 times, each time he said he'd call me back after a few minutes but he didn't.  So i gave up with him and called up and spoke to Sagna, she was no help, so i tried Jimmy again and he'd given me the wrong extension number and ended up speaking to some girl (didnt catch her name) who said Jimmy was busy with someone.    Then Luke DID call me back, woohoo! but then he said he had to go away and call me back later... boohoo..... Eventually, he called back then I realised I'd ordered a replacement card cos it'd been damaged but tried it anyway....  Only to get another call back to say it had been declined..... I can't use anyone else's card cos i'm getting an e-ticket!  Could this get any more stupid??
Stepping out of the cool air-conditioned car, and into the bloody hot humid and smelly air, just reminds me of being on holiday.. in Hong Kong.  Today must be the hottest day of the year so far or at least the hottest evening of the year so far cos I am feeling uncomfortably sticky in my room right now.    Dreading having to do another full week at work.  I feel quite sick of working.  It doesn't help that I'm looking at holiday brochures and stuff. Can't wait for my day off next week when I'm going Alton Towers.  Will be staying in a caravan... for the first time!  Should be loads of fun.
As I Mature I've learned that you cannot make someone love you.  All you can do is stalk them and hope they panic and give in.   I've learned that no matter how much I care,  some people are just assholes.   I've learned that it takes years to build up trust,  and it only takes suspicion, not proof, to destroy it.   I've learned that you can get by on charm for about fifteen minutes.  After that, you'd better have a big willy or huge boobs.   I've learned that you shouldn't compare yourself to others -  they are more screwed up than you think.   I've learned that you can keep vomiting  long after you think you're finished.   I've learned that we are responsible for what we do,  unless we are celebrities.   I've learned that regardless of how hot and steamy a relationship is at first,  the passion fades, and there had better be a lot of money to take its place!   I've learned that the people you care most about in life  are taken from you too soon  and all the less important ones just never go away.
Trade downloads were buggered today, and yesterday, and the day before.  Coincidently, haven't updated my blog since going to work on Monday!  Maybe it's stressing me out without me realising?  Makes my work more manual than it already is but it's the fact that they still not fixed it which annoys me most.   I'm going to take a nap now and hopefully wake up to dinner!
