IT SURE HAS BEEN AWHILE   So June was a slow month.  I had nothing interesting to talk about.  July is slowly shaping up that way too.  I don't know why, but there just isn't anything that I really feel passionate enough to write about.  I suppose that I could write about the election, or the beheadings in Iraq, but that is already being beaten to death (pardon the pun) by every other blogger in America.  I suppose I will just continue the sabbatical until something interesting comes in my head.  Until then, keep checking back...You never know when I will post something.

GOOD LORD IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME.    I realize that it has been over a month since my last post, but man did the really have to go and change the blogger.&nbsp; I do like that I can now upload pictures to the blog, and expect a bunch to come in the upcoming weeks.&nbsp; I will say that things have been pretty interesting over the last couple of weeks.&nbsp; I am waiting to hear about a full time Promotions Director job at the radio station.&nbsp; I am moving to a new casa on August 4, and we lost Digit, the dwarf chameleon we adopted in March.&nbsp; Keep checking back as a new look and newly updated blog will return in August.&nbsp; Until then, take care.&nbsp;   PS: Look for a complete wrap up of the 2004 Democratic National Convention early next week with my thoughts on the winners and losers as we count down to election day 2
