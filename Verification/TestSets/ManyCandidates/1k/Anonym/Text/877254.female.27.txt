out and about with the Suits who think they have found a piece of arm candy. The only problem: One of the Suits has a soul. At least that's the way it seems. Usually, they just come in, they want to talk, we smile, flirt, I get lovely gifts... but this suit is different. I didn't meet him at the BackPorch, I met him while on campus trying to figure out when, if ever, I could return to my education. I've been happy with my life at Hades, and I don't think I'm ready to leapfrog back to the lifestyle I once led--not that I could. Too much has changed. I think I forgot how to be the "upstanding, responsible" woman my family knew. At least I forgot how to pretend to be her. Anyway, the library is usually a quiet place to battle my conflicting thoughts, but this suit approaches me and asks to join me. He just sat there and thought too. Beyond strange, I know, and I couldn't think because I was wondering what the hell he was thinking about the whole time, so my thinking time was ruined.  I got up to go and he asked me to join him for a drink. He was a suit afterall, and a good looking one. Over a cosmopolitan I found out this suit was a Smart Suit, a Prof. We talked, agreed to meet up again. Honestly I can't tell you why I agreed. I didn't get but a drink from him... and I felt completely uncomfortable at the thought of lifting his wallet. I need to stay away from that place. So after a few meetings, casual, talks, chats, conversation that I never could have with a customer on the graveyard shit at Hades, I decided that he was dangerous to my chosen lifestyle. I didn't call him. I didn't even give him the nuber of the Phone in the Hallway outside my room. He knew though. He showed up tonight before the rush.  I was busy polishing a glass set for a few of the regular suits who wanted their shots in snifters, and I look up to count the number of them and find the Prof in front of me, collar up, hands folded on the bar. The super brief conversation that followed, well, I can't remember much of it. I was just shocked. The one thing that trew me for a loop: He told me I was the most amazing woman he ever met. And then he left. What the hell! You can't leave after that! Myra was busy with her end of things, and I watched him smile up to Bane with a confidence that ignored the fact that he was in a totally different neighborhood, a part of town I didn't think he even knew existed. He just left as if I should know how to react to that! What did that mean, and why do I care? Screw this writing thing, I need to find Myra... she'll knock some sense into m
