my results were::  Your subconscious mind is driven most by Peace   You are driven by a higher purpose than most people. You have a deeply-rooted desire to facilitate peacefulness in the world. Whether through subtle interactions with love ones, or through getting involved in social causes, it is important to you to influence the world.  You are driven by a desire to encourage others to think about the positive side of things instead of focusing on the negative. The reason your unconscious is consumed by this might stem from an innate fear of war and turmoil. Thus, to avoid that uncomfortable place for you, your unconscious seeks out the peace in your environment.   Usually, the thing that underlies this unconscious drive is a deep respect for humankind. You care about the future of the world, even beyond your own involvement in it. As a result, your personal integrity acts as a surrogate for your deeper drive toward peace and guides you in daily life towards decisions that are respectful toward yourself and others.
Here are some bad pickup lines that I've heard in the past few months...  ~*~Some guy came up to me, with his hand out as if to give me something...as he opened it up, he said: "It's my breath from when you took it away.  ~*~This one a guy in Morristown told me...He got my attention though. "Do you believe in love at first sight, or should I walk by again?"  ~*~A famous one, makes you think, but also gets a convo started and a little laugh. "Don't you know me from somewhere?"  ~*~Ok, this one REALLY got me, this guy tried hard, and it worked. This is how it went. "Excuse me miss? You dropped something back there?" I started looking around and I said "Where?!" and he said "Over there!" and again I ask "Where, what did I drop?" He answered back... "My jaw!  ~*~I personally liked this one, only because it made him look lame and it was funny-cute: "You make me want to get a job!"  ~*~This is one I get through IM alot, what's the deal boys?! Here goes: HIM: "I know how to please a woman."   ME: "Then please leave me alone."   I know there are a bunch of crazy pick-up lines out there... Guys, I know it's hard to pick-up a girl these days. They usually go to bars with friends, and if they are with other girls, it's hard to approach them without looking desperate, just don't try so hard. Most girls, who go out...wanting to meet guys, will let you know if they dig you via eye-contact or a smile or brushing up against you while walking by. Most girls who are excessively loud are striving some sort of attention. But...beware, they may want your attention and would be open to have you talk to them or something, but sometimes they can be the type of person who just likes general attention and isn't afraid to put you down - loudly. LOL.  Ok...I guess that's the end of this e
