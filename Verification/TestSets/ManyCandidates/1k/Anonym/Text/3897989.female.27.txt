ready to start painting. I'm getting excited now. My creativity has been on high frequency the past few days. I have so many ideas. The children are getting excited too. They question me every morning on when we're going to start painting. The boys decided they want a sky mural in their room. They want it with sky and clouds up to the center and blended into the starry night at the top. Now this is coming from a 3 and 5 year old! It's amazing to observe the chakras they are developing now. I'm really going to have to encourage my little girl's spirit. With her being 8 years old now, she has a lot of western beliefs being thrown her way by society now than she has in past years. I'm hoping by giving them the best of both eastern and western philosophies in our home that they will have less energy blockages than I did once I got older. They already know how to meditate, do several yoga poses, the Qigong Wuji short form, they understand the purpose of feng shui, fountains, certain plants, animals, they understand a lot of native American history and drumming. Native American music really seems to inspire my little girl. It' amazing to listen to her sing along in their native tongue. Of couse, this evening, she discovered my Jimmy Buffet song, Volcano. I've put a shortcut on the desktop for her to get to it easily.  A few months ago I was helping my Mother by cleaning her house since she had shoulder surgery; my Father came home for lunch while I was there with my 3 year old. Dad ate his lunch and told my little boy to be real still and quiet for 10 minutes while Pappa went to his meditation place. My little boy gets sweetly close to his face and says, "can I go too Papa?" He realized they weren't "going" anywhere. It was very sweet to have my Father explain to him meditation.  Speaking of meditation, I'm going to retire for the evening and do a little of my own. There's alot more I got to experience this weekend, like making a couple cheesecakes with my little girl, and helping her with her school project of 15 seed variations and 15 seashell variations (of which I can only find 3 different seashells in my house and my friends!!), did lawnwork, and so much more, but I'll save those stories for another time. I really enjoyed staying active this weekend (even though my hamstrings have still given me trouble) and meeting all the wonderful new people that I have and making so many new friends this week. I feel my heart is finally opening and bringing to the world the person who is being held so dear by many. I do miss my love and hope he is well. I send him great stillness tonight as he rests. May his following day go smoothly as the waters of calmness and clarity hand him forth serenity.  With love,  B
