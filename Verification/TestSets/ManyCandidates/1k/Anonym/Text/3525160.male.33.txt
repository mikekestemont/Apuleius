last one.  Now I have taken my own blog virginity.  I feel dirty, but I liked it.  Qualifies as one of those "moments" (see above).
Isn't it strange how life seems to stand still at times?&nbsp; Then, when it is ready to start moving again, it goes from zero-to-200 just slightly faster than the speed of light.&nbsp; Thank goodness that I long ago shed the notion that it was fair.  After working overseas for nearly 5 years, I returned to reacquaint myself with my wife and two kids.&nbsp; After about 2-3 months of being back at home, it became time to find a job and do the "man" thing.&nbsp; The problem is that the IT world here in little ol' Arkansas hadn't exactly had time to feel the movement out of the funk that was just starting to occur in the field.&nbsp; And, hey, in case you didn't know, savings don't 'xactly last forever.  So, finally, this past Tuesday, I accepted a low-paying position with a great retail company with the unspoken notion that, barring me falling flat on my face in this endeavor, I would be quickly heading up the proverbial ladder.&nbsp; We're talking about a type of Regional Manager role by the end of the year.&nbsp; THAT is quick.&nbsp; I would be called on Thursday to be told when to come in for orientation, paperwork, and to start the job.  But HOLD THE PHONE, MARGARET!&nbsp; An hour prior to this aforementioned phone call actually came, a great IT company called to request my presence for a little interview the following Thursday.&nbsp; Um... yes.

The female manager at this retail place is a fantastic human being that pulled a string or two to get me in.&nbsp; I do not want to betray her, or even be portrayed as though I am playing from both sides of the card table, though, in fact, this is actually what I'm doing.&nbsp; I am hedging every bet I can.&nbsp; I think this is prudent, wise, and responsible for the sake of my family.&nbsp; But I have this overwhelming feeling of loyalty toward the person who reached out and took in the "straggler" from a different industry on truly nothing more than a gut instinct.  I have resigned myself that I will "Come to Jesus" when I see her on Monday to do my initial paperwork.&nbsp; If this is presented in an honest light of "the money you're paying me is fine, but the other place will pay all the bills", she should understand.  Worst of all, I knew things would work out in such a way as this.&nbsp; They always do for me.&nbsp; I just never thought I would establish a loyalty toward a specific person so rapidly.&nbsp; Things look great in the forest.&nbsp; It sucks if you're in the t
