As it falls the drop is singular among many, distinguished from the other drops nearby. Striking the surface it is absorbed into the pool and its individuality as a drop is dissolved while simultaneously expanded to encompass the whole pool. Instead of reflecting the world from the outside of a small sphere, it reflects from the entire surface of the pool. As one delves deeper and deeper into the Self, more and more of creation is reflected on its surface.
EDIT:  Thank you to  urlLink John Fenderson  for pointing out  urlLink The Mitochondria Conspiracy  to me.  This one sentence sums up my point as succinctly as a sack of breaks falling on your head:  " Their real purpose?  Conquest!!  Eons ago these nasty wee beasties invaded the happy eukariotes off Pangaea'a shores, convincing them with slick tongues and fancy mini-chromosomes to enter into a bargain, and it was a Bargain With The Devil! "    Mitochondria organelles are found in cells of multicellular organisms.  They have been called the "powerhouse of the human body."  They are responsible for getting the energy out of glucose in respiration by breaking it down into ATP.  They exist in each cell of the human body and are responsible for the synthesis of proteins from amino-acids and the replicaiton of DNA. [ urlLink Mitochondria ]  In short, these cells are necessary for the most basic physical aspects of life and reproduction of organisms on a cellular level.  But mitochondria are not part of our bodies.  They have their own DNA.  They are another species living in our bodies that needs us for shelter while we need them for energy.  Mitochondria have their own replication cycle independent of the host-organism's, yet they regulate that host's own DNA replication cycle. [ urlLink Mitochondria: Architecture dictates function ]  The video game  Parasite Eve  for PS1 suggests that mitochondria have significantly evolved and have even begun to take control of their host organisms.  While this is only a video game, the idea is compelling: We have a foreign organism living in every cell of our bodies that we depend on for our own cellular reproduction.  A significant number of forces in human society are externalized communication from the DNA-RNA feedback system (i.e. awareness of the necessity of reproduction for continuing the species, whether as conscious analysis or intuitive urges).  How many of these forces are tied to the necessity of mitochondria reproduction, for which we are merely vehicles or vessels?  What memes have we developed solely for the benefit of these organisms but not necessarily our own?  As is said on the homepage of the  urlLink Mitochondria Research Society : "Mitochondria Means the Most to Us".   urlLink In study , it appears that mitochondria are also drivers of information processing in neurons, that is there is some link between neural activity and the mitochondria energy production cycle.  I can only surmise there is some link between our thought patterns, our bio-survival urges, and the reproductive necessities of the mitochondria we house.   Whose DNA are we competing for the successful evolution of a
