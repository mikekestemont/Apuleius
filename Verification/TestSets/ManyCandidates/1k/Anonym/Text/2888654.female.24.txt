hours at Nick's place I felt the need to leave because Nick's guest had arrived, Nick needed to take a shower, and I needed to call home, it was getting late. I had a long ride ahead of me. Nick told me he had so much to do with the guy from San Diego and him were driving south to San Diego and back. I left on a good note and he wished me an early birthday. We hugged at least three times! He warned me not to have a Scorpion drink at Trad'r Sam's the bar establishment down below his place. I had asked his roommate Sam how do they sleep through the noise and all. You just get used to it ! I hope I get to come back to his place someday again because I still would like to know what kind of music does he listen to when he is on or off the road. Until then in two days I'll be 24!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing is or ever be predictable in my life, it seems most days my life is plain unpredicable. Expect the unexpected!   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had&nbsp;a &nbsp;great moment for Mr.Know-It-All, he always inquires where I am going, why I don't wear my headset like I am supposed to, and anything business like, in other words he a narrow minded bossy head because well he has to. Earlier I had the privilage to buy Harry Potter jellybeans and one of them tastes like real dirt, sardine, or buttered popcorn. They are unusual flavor jellybeans and I enjoy striking out my petty revenge. So I had the privilage of giving Mr.Know-It-All a&nbsp;"Dirt" jellybean and boy he didn't like it! I had my moment.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I been trying to reach Nick but there hasn't been much success and I don't want to be too persistant because then I will scare him away and I don't want to lose him as a&nbsp; new found old classmate/crush/friend.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw Catwoman because the earlier showing of The Bourne Supremacy was sold out and when I did see a latter showing, the movie made me fall asleep and it made me dizzy too. It was the camera movements and the fight scenes that kept on spinning uncontrollably it had reminded me of the time I was at Todo Santo Park, in Concord, when I was 9.   &nbsp;&nbsp; I called up old classmates like Jessica and heisitantly I called Pete also but our conversation was brief. I am so over him but I will be his friend if he ever needs one and I know he will. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; I've am ridiculously popular in The Cole Valley neighborhood, I go on myspace.com practically on every hour upon the hour, been watching old episodes of Nip/Tuck on my DVD player, having the urge to try a new job because I need a new beginning, hmmm that's just about it but other than that I will 24 in a couple of days.&nbsp; I guess I'll just be spontaneous and all. Peace and all that j
