quickly advised him, "You will, Mr. President, you will."  Sidenote: A woman in my hometown, the wife of a policeman, currently has 2 kids under age 7, and is expecting quintuplets. Her husband is about to ship out to the war in Iraq, a war we shouldn't have been in in the first place. It's families just like these all over the US that are suffering for George W. Bush's mistakes.  (This message has been sponsored by the frustrated ravings of Tim French, and is in no way affiliated with the Democratic Party)  Tim
Hall√≥  I'm sitting here in the middle of the night checking out pictures from BCN and figured I hadn't bloged for a while. So I can't sleep have something in my throat and am about to work 8 hours and then go to school for something like 4 hours. Oh yes its first day of school but I still have two weeks left at work it will be hectic couple of weeks and Im almost counting on getting sick. The reason why I start now is that they have this class that we only take for three weeks and get full credit for it and I owe some. The course is called entrepreneurship and Internal Marketing and is thought by a teacher my school stole from IESE (reportedly the best business school in Spain situated very close to ESADE). Hope it will be fun.  I got a part time job at the bank I've been working at this summer which is very nice because it looks very well on a CV. The downside though is that I'm rather bored with it. I did tell Tim in an email the full story about big names in Icelandic business being my bosses and that I got great recommendations now but it was rather boring so I'm going to skip to something else.  Today (Monday) is an Icelandic day of called Traders Day-of. This is the biggest traveling and party weekend around here. Many people leave town to go camping with perhaps thousands of others and its a blast. The onces who stay at home try to have more fun than the once who left and I was one of them. I went partying on Friday, Saturday I had a bit of a cold on Friday and on Sunday my vocal cords just gave up and I could barely come up with a word anyone could hear.  Just before I came home I went to a sport bar to watch Chelsea-Milan with a friend. He had invited a friend of his who's girlfriend kissed me on Friday and we danced all night (She kissed me... To be noted). How do you handel situation like that?  Also I'm going to Hungary to visit my cousin who studies medicine there I'm also hoping to visit Adam and Edgar on the way back. It will be a 10 day trip with five days in each country. I'm going to call A tomorrow from work (its free there:D).  I think that's it for now.  L
