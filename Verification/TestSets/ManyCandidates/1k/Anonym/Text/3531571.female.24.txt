mine....  Jaymel..
be still, sad heart and cease repining; behind the clouds is the sun still shining; thy fate is the common fate of all, into each life some rain might fall,  some days must be dark and dready.
When I say I love you I do But this with you will not do I need someone I can lean on Someone I can count on too  Yes you are there sometimes For that I am grateful to you But I need someone there full time And that you can not do  You told me once you loved me That I could believe in you I was there when you needed someone Where were you when I needed someone, too?  The time has come for me to let go Never to expect you to care again People may come and people may go But my love will never end     ..i will keep on loving, even if its not you.... jaymel
Believe in the impossible, hold tight to the incredible and live each day to the fullest potential. This is how you make a difference in your world.
MASTERCARD WEDDING  &nbsp;   You gotta love this guy.....&nbsp; This is a true story about a recent wedding that&nbsp;took place at Clemson University. It was in the local&nbsp;newspaper&nbsp;and even Jay Leno mentioned it.&nbsp;It was a huge wedding with about 300 guests. After the&nbsp;wedding at&nbsp;the reception, the groom got up on stage with a microphone to&nbsp;talk to the crowd. He said he wanted to thank everyone for coming, many from long distances, to support them at their&nbsp;wedding. He especially wanted to thank the bride's and his&nbsp;family and to thank his new father-in-law for providing such&nbsp;a lavish reception. As a token of his deep appreciation&nbsp;he said he wanted to give everyone a special gift just&nbsp;from him. So taped to the bottom of everyone's chair,&nbsp;including the wedding party, was a manila envelope.&nbsp;He said this was his gift to everyone, and asked&nbsp;them to open their envelope.&nbsp;Inside each manila envelope was an 8 x 10 glossy&nbsp;of his bride having sex with the best man. The groom&nbsp;had gotten suspicious of them weeks earlier and had hired a&nbsp;private detective to tail them. After just standing there,&nbsp;just&nbsp;watching the guests' reactions for a couple of minutes, he&nbsp;turned&nbsp;to the best man and said, "F--- you!".&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he turned to his bride and said, "F--- you!".&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he turned to the dumbfounded crowd and&nbsp;said, "I'm outta here."&nbsp;&nbsp;He had the marriage annulled first thing in the&nbsp;morning. While most people would have canceled the wedding&nbsp;immediately after finding out about the affair, this guy goes&nbsp;through with the charade, as if nothing were wrong. His&nbsp;revenge.... making the bride's parents pay over $32,000 for a&nbsp;300&nbsp;guest wedding and reception, and best of all, trashing the&nbsp;bride's and best man's reputations in front of 300&nbsp;friends and family members. This guy has balls the size&nbsp;of church bells.&nbsp; Do you think we might get a MasterCard "priceless"&nbsp;commercial out of this?&nbsp;&nbsp;Elegant wedding reception for 300 family members and&nbsp;friends..........$32,000.
