need to understand. And that takes time!  Well, work is good - a bit tedious coz I dunno my topic too well, but I am getting there! So far smooth sail. No, I did not trip and break my incisor on the first day itself. It's allright. It would be wrong to say I do not  miss Netaphase - I miss it like MAD! But then this is good in its own place. Plus, I have a feeling it will get better with time. Like today I was speaking to this colleague who has a passion for modern jazz - man! It made me miss Sundeep all the more... There is so much happening in my head. Apoorva is off next week to India. I was scheduled to go but then the job happened. I will be home alone - that sucks! No one to listen to my sermons. Ok! Time to get home, pour a drink, curl up on the couch and give my views on the ways of the world. So to home I go.
It is  official ! I am no longer unemployed. That means I am employed. I actually  am ! I shall be joining a company called Corporate Publishing International (CPI) tomorrow as a Press Writer. I went today and signed an employment contract that told me so. My timings will be 8:30-6:00 with an hour-long break around midday to twiddle my toes and have lunch. My off-days will be Friday and Saturday giving me a 5-day work week *bliss*. I have been informed that my work shall entail both writing and editing mainly about Information Technology. For more info about the company (oh! My) please visit the corporate website:  urlLink http://www.cpilive.net/  Wish me luck. It is going to be tough waking up at 6 rather than my usual between 10 and 10:30 – plus ….it would mean not wearing my pyjamas for a majority part of the day – now that is sacrilege. From now onwards life in Dubai shall be divided into two time eras. Before Employment (BE) and After Employment (AE), the rest as they say has already made retail history! So now you have the official info...yes, once you sign a paper that says Employment Contract, its got to be official. Tomorrow will be my first working day after my last working day at Netaphase that was January 15th. Now I know I continued writing for them but then that ain't the same as smashing the alarm, getting grumpily dressed, eating breakfast in the car and running to your desk and replying to a gazillion mails. And coming home in the evening like a lump of tied knots. That is heaven. Going back to it after 6 months. Months of house shifting, getting sick, going to Al Ain, cribbing about the sun, shopping my heart out, having house guests, throwing house warming parties and getting depressed over change. *Sigh* life is what happens to you while you are busy making plans (betcha Apoorva would said "na re, it is wife not life"...*apprehensively s
