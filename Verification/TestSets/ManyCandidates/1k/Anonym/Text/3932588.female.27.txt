after 9:00 a.m. so you'll be fine there.  Get there a little early to get a good parking spot.  FROM THE NORTH:  I-5 Fwy.  Exit at Via de la Valle.  Head west (turn right). Turn left on Jimmy Durant Blvd. (street before race track). Jimmy Durant Blvd. merges onto Camino Del Mar (keep heading south on Camino Del Mar). Turn right on 15th Street. 15th Street end at the park at Ocean Blvd. Park on street.  There are spots on 15th Street and on surrounding streets (i.e., Stratford).  The spots on 15th are 2 hour parking spots after 9:00 a.m. so you'll be fine there.  Get there a little early to get a good parking spot.  Please let your mentor know if you cannot make the run.  This will be a beautiful, and yes, challenging course up Torrey Pines Reserve.  Will also include a 2/3 mile trail run.  This is one of our favorite runs and hope you enjoy it too!  Let me know if you have any questions.  To your health,  Wendy
Thank you Mary Kay, Debra, Wendy and Bonnie for mapping out our runs in some of the most beautiful spots of San Diego. Part of the excitement, in our Sunday run, is anticipating where the trail will lead us. Even though we had to run up HILLS, I have enjoyed the trails and the scenery. I loved running through the seemingly country roads of Rose Canyon, looking over and up the cliffs of Encinitas and La Jolla and checking out the homes in La Jolla.  Thanks again for your time and effort. It really is appreciated.
