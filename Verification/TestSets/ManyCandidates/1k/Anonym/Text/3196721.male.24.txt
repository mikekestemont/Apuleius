at night but Jimi can get him moving.  "Hear my train a comin'...hear my train a comin'.....hear my train a comin'......" And Jimi takes over on guitar.  Rock out and have a good night, everybody!
I walked home through the rain tonight and it was the most spiritual thing I've been a part of for a long time. I was left alone with my thoughts and the gentle tapping of the rain. It was like God was washing away all the worries and doubts.  I would like to write more about this wonderful night but will save it until tomorrow. I must get some sleep after a very long and confusing week sleep-wise.
I broke off surveilence early tonight. The housing story has turned into a very difficult story. The neighbours talked to me tonight and told a very different story of what was going on.

Now I know I shouldn't begrudge these people because they're working hard for what they get. I understand that but circumstance has so much to do with how far they've gotten so quickly. It seems timing is not my thing. I graduated in the middle of a mini recession and just when papers where starting the complete conversion to digital. I was part of the last class to be taught using film. Basically I'm a dinosaur in the pj business.  I'd like to go digital but have no money in which to switch over. It's the classic catch-22 situation. I need a digital to compete in the freelance market where I can make more money but I need money to get the digital to make money. And around I go on the merry-go-round. The trick is getting off the merry-go-round standing u
