night my parents prompted me to sleep in our new portable hammock, its really awesome, except i sleep on my stomach, so it was pretty uncomfortable. (think about it, its like i was doing some acrobatic move). so then i had guitar today but afterwards i went to turn my applications in to jimmy john's and panera. then i had a one dollar limeade from ben and jerry's which was very good. thats all for now.
This thing is amazing, check it out.  http://www.news.uconn.edu/2004/jun2004/rel04065.htm
i know, as usual it's been a long time since i've written. there is much new news. which begs the questions can news be assigned an age or maturity, and is old news still news? anyway, let's start from the top (pun intended), shall we? mt. top was last week. for those of you who don't know that's where i go bust my ass for jesus in tennessee. it was pretty fun i suppose. and i use fun not in describing the spiritual aspect but in purely the social aspect, just to clarify. i have been there, i have been on the 'right path' and it was...i dunno just kinda drab. so here i am now. i still go because it's usually a lot of fun, and was, for the most part, a good time this year as well. i met some crazy people (christin and ashlyn aka kristin) who taught me who taught me the greatest song ever. its called the rigabumboo (spelling?) song and its a classic camp song complete with hand motions. and i bought the coolest recorder ever from the goodwill store in tennessee. its all ghetto, like the ones you played in 3rd or 4th grade or whatever. its fun but its really odd to play, like i don't think i yet understand the way it works, because i'll cover up a hole and the pitch won't change. i need a flutist or a clarinetist to explain it to me. so we got home sunday night, and i did nothing really until tuesday, when i got applications for jimmy johns and panera. hopefully i'll get a job there. then some night in there i went to hazi's surprise party, which was rockin', let me tell you. there were probably 10 people there so me and vidmar left for some campfire where i didn't really know anyone, save megan and vidmar. so i stood there for about 20 minutes haha and then left to go to vidmar's to watch monster, which is a really good movie about this woman who looks like a man and her life sucks because shes a hooker and she becomes lez but keeps hooking guys anyway and... i'll let you see the movie. its really good, probably in my top 10 (which i really need to post on here sometime). speaking of movies, last night i saw fahrenheit 9/11 with caitlin. a hilariously funny and liberal movie, i encourage everyone to see it, especially conservatives. it might just change the way you think about stuff. that's all for now, l
