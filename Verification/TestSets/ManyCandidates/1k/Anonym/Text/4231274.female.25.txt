He told me how he’d fancied me for ages and really liked me and while part of me was reluctant to go out with him, feeling that we were better off as friends rather than lovers, in the end I was persuaded to give it a go. I still can’t figure out what it is about him that makes me be unable to get him out of my head. It’s not even like I really fancy him that much. He’s too tall, I’m only 5 foot 3 whereas he’s over 6 foot tall, he’s way too skinny and even though he isn’t even 30 is well on his way to baldness. He’s got gappy teeth and smokes. And yet I can’t forget about him, can’t seem to move on. Part of the problem is the fact that we work together. Not smart to screw the crew I know but these things happen. I should have learned my lesson after the last one but then girls never do, do we? He was a bad one, a psychotic, alcoholic Irish shit who started threatening my family when I stopped answering his calls. After him it took me a long time to trust a man again and look what happened when I did. The next one dumps me for a girl he used to work with. To me that’s worse that dumping me a person he’s just met. It makes me think that I was just a convenience, just a substitute for this other girl and that he was just using me because he couldn’t have her. I know this properly isn’t the case but I can’t help but feel that. I put my heart on the line for him and he squashed it, cast it aside at the first opportunity. Maybe that’s part of the problem, I give myself up too easily, allow myself to be hurt. I know it sounds old fashioned but I’ve never got my head around the concept of sex being something just for fun, to me it’s something to be shared between two people who care about each other and to treat it in any other way cheapens it. I don’t think I ask for much out of a relationship, just to meet someone who’ll cuddle me and hug me, who’ll make me feel special and loved. So far I haven’t found that and I’m starting to doubt that I will. To tell you the truth I’m beginning to wonder if the pains worth it so far I’ve given and I’ve given and all I’ve got in return is shat on from a great height. the real problem is that i have to work with him every day. it's hard and i hate it. because i work in a casino everyone knows my business, knows exactly what happened between us and how much i was hurt. part of me really wants him back and yet another part wishes it had never happened. he was my friend before he was my lover and i miss that. i miss h
