Bob, played by  urlLink Robert Musgrave  and Mr. Henry played by the ever popular  urlLink James Caan .  This is another movie from  urlLink Wes Anderson  who's done  urlLink Rushmore  and  urlLink Royal Tennenbaums .  The Wilson brothers and a couple of friends are trying to pull a heist to impress Mr. Henry and basically everything goes wrong.  This isn't a stupid-funny or cheesy comedy though.  It's the sort of smart-humor that can be found in a movie like  urlLink Napoleon Dynamite .
Saw  Runaway Jury  with Joe and Cheryl and Jim (a.k.a Superjew from the Springs) and his very pregnant wife Nichole. I'm not exactly sure how much I liked it yet. There were definitely some cool aspects to it like John Cusack  not  in a  High Fidelity - Grosse Pointe Blank - Say Anything  role (even though I own and enjoy all 3), Gene Hackman, Dustin Hoffman and Rachel Weisz, interesting plot, etc.  Some things I didn't really like was how the movie kinda advocated that gun companies are responsible for the violence that people act out with them. I'm sure many people disagree with me on this, as I so easily found out being at Taylor, but I really don't see the logic in that. Being a gun owner, I know that it takes a finger to pull the trigger. The gun is just a tool. More people die every year car related incidents then gun related incidents. So why don't people get 'up-in-arms' (pun intended) over crappy drivers all the time and sue the car companies? Ok, I'll get off my soapbox.  This movie was a decent court-room drama sort of thing that was a bit suspenseful and contained a few twist sorta things. If you're a Cusack fan I'd definitely recommend this - especially if you enjoyed seeing him branch out in  Identity.
People say that talking about this movie too much will ruin the surprise for people. I didn't find there was much of a surprise, but that doesn't mean I didn't like it.  In fact, I liked it a lot.  I would not say it's as wholly entertaining or surprising as  The Sixth Sense , but it's more intelligent. It's a movie to think and talk about.  Everybody does a great job.  urlLink Joaquin  Phoenix,  urlLink Adrien  Brody, and  urlLink Bryce  Dallas Howard were the most important characters and the best performances in movie. Finally, Adrien's in another good movie. It's about time.  People are freaking out over the fact that this movie doesn't turn out to be a typical monster movie. Who wants to see the same movie over and over again? This is going to be one of those movies that divides people into the love it or hate it camp. I'm in the love it camp.  M.  urlLink Night  Shyamalan is a good director. The unusual decisions he made in this movie -- shots from far away, extended and uncut close-ups, etc -- all helped give  The Village  a unique and distinct feel. Yay for Night. I hope he continues to do w
