flippin long to get to everyone. We get there at 2:36pm (our appointment if for 2:40pm) We sit in the crowded waiting room for a good 10-15 minutes. It's August it's hot in there and it's packed. Lovely. So we finally get to go in. We sit there for a good time again. The nurse comes in and weighs Megan. 15lbs 2oz yay Megan. She is now 61cm long and is doing great. Oh they grow so fast!  Then a Medical Student comes in. Asks a whole bunch of useless questions and then sits and chats with us for another good 10 minutes. Then finally the doctor comes in takes a quick look at the baby asks how everything is ( all of which I just told the student) she leaves and then the nurse comes back in to give the shot. My poor little girl. I hold her down while the nurse jabs this thing in her thigh and I look at her face as she cries cause it hurts. I quickly pick her up and hold her and the crying stops. Good girl! That's it we're done. Let's get the heck outta here! We get in the car and look at the clock 3:58pm! That was insane. Do they not here the baby crying, do they not care that she's hungry and was just stabbed in the leg with a painful fluid going through her? No I guess not. They'd rather make what could be a short and sweet visit into this long horrible one. Grrrr.  Megan went to bed at 7:30pm. Connor's not home... why am I still up?
Okay that was close. The problem was the bunny post. See what I tried doing was signing up for blog rolling, and I am trying to put the peoples blogs I read on the sidebar. But when I did that everything went screwy. Thanks  urlLink Jenny  for reminding me about the "too big of a picture thing" I did that once before too. I noticed yours and  urlLink C.E's  looked different from mine. I'll try again.
What the heck did I do wrong now. I shouldn't have touched it.
I don't particularily like Mondays. Tuesdays are okay I guess because I look forward to Wednesdays. Thursdays I don't like much either ( well except in the fall when Survivor & ER are on... :( no more Friends though :'(  Fridays are like Tuesdays for me, I look forward to Saturdays. Sundays are always nice.  Tomorrow Megan goes for her second needle. I'm nervous again. You'd think I'd be use to this by now having gone though it once already with Connor. But I think I'm more nervous because the last needle Megan got,she had a reaction of conjuntivitis from it. *thankfully* I knew what that was and what to do because Connor had it once. Having a second child is much easier I think.   Thanks Jenny... I'll see if I can figure it out.
