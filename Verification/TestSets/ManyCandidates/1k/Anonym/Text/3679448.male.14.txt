the question" But I'll just have to go :(  "Evanesence -  Everybody's fool" is like my favorite song right now. I gotta try getting it on mp3 ;) although I like "addicted" of "simple plan" a lot too... I dunno what it is, the last year, my interest for music has grown... I never liked music, now I cant live without. All off the sudden I don't like the vacation no more.. Please, please let me goto school in tha vacation! may sound stupid, but I just dunno what to do... maybe I'm just gonna learen myself how to skateboard, or I'm gonna buy me a pair of rollerblades or sumting.... I heard they are quite popular again, and it gives me sumting to do too :) well, I dont like wasting ur time any more, so I'm gonna stop typing. Bye.
just right now, when vacation has just truly begun, I hear that danique has a boyfriend... I dont feel like posting, I'm going to bed...
Hello peoplez, itsa me again! yesterday and today I was @ my grandparents's so I wasn't online... Haven't chatted with peoplez for like 4 dayz now, except for a brief moment with vince and a guy called tarik. Anywayz, its been great fun the last 2 dayz, but sadn @ tha same time. I had a really weird dream about Danique last night. We where doing all kinds of stuff together, but something everytime went wrong and just before I woke up, she walked off with vince... ok, I know that doesnt make any sence whatsoever, but it still made me feel very sad. What made me happy again was my grandpa trying to computer XP it just so rules to see him trieing and trieing over again :) ok, enough happy things.. gonna wait till my dad leaves the house, then I'm gonna cry my eyeballs out cause of tha stupid dream (I didn't had the time to do that yet XP)  peace out
wheeh! I'm still alive :) allthough it was close, I was almost drivven over by a car :0 I got a photo of myself on my comp, my dad was really happy and made a photo of me with a borrowed digital camera, but the photo is really screwed, XP I dont dare putting it online ;) dont really have much to say, I'm just such a booring person, I hate myself XP I'm really gonna find me a hobby or something, maybe I can play gitar again, or trumpet or sumting... but thats such a long time ago, I'm pwetty sure I cant do it anymore... maybe I need to go and learn like skateboarding or sumting XD but I'm acting obsessive again, so I need to go punish myself for that XP bye-bye :)
itsa.. me... yeah, well, I decided to stop blogging, cuz I really dont feel like writing no more these days.. I'm still happy on the outside, but on the inside I feel just terrible.. well, I hope someone liked this short blogspot XP yeah, well... byebyez :
