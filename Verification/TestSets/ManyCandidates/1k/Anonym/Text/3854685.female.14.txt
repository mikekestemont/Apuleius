roped me in so...mesmorizing so...hyptnotizing I am, captivated I am, Vindicated I am selfish, I am wrong, I am right, I swear I'm right I swear I knew it all along, and I am thawed,but I am cleaning up so well, I am seeing in me now The things you swear you saw yourselves...So clear, like the diamond in your ring. Cut to mirror your intention. Oversized and overwhelmed, The shine of which has caught my eye It rendered me so, isolated so, motivated I am..certain now that I am... Vindicated I am selfish, I am wrong, I am right, I swear I'm rightt I swear I knew it all along, and I am thawed,but I am cleaning up so well,I am seeing in me now The things you swear you saw yourselves...So tired, of the corners of your lips Bite them, and feel my fingertips Trace the moment for forever..Defense is paper thin, just one touch and I'll be into, deep now to ever swim Against the current..so let me slip away So let me slip away So let me slip away So let me slip against the current. So let me slip away So let me slip away So let me slip away So let me slip away. Vindicated I am selfish, I am wrong, I am right, I swear I'm right I swear I knew it all along, and I am thawed,but I am cleaning up so well,I am seeing in me now The things you swear you saw yourselves...My hope dangles on a string. Like slow spinning redemption.
I hate this stupid website. I really do. None of those worked!! Hopefully this on will! Gah, I am just gona..delete all the ones that didn't work. Well the last 2 or 3. Hmmph. I feel sick. My fucking eyeliner broke and I am realizing that my spelling sucks and needs definite improvement. Bah.
I do believe that my last post didnt work. Blooger is being a right ass this week now isn't it? I am...upset. But not. I know I should be angry but I don't feel any different than I did moments ago when I thought the freaking thing worked. I had an interesting conversation with Carrie. She asked me why I cut. I asked her why she cut. Neither of us answered. Isn't that the way it is supposed to be? No one telling anyone anything? So that nothing can happen to hurt you? I think so. I feel bad because I think it has something to do with her dad...and me. She may've started after I did. I think I might've helped her decide that she could. I don't know though. Who am I to judge other peoples thoughts and actions? No one. You know sometimes I wish I had someone to hold me and comfort me about the minor things, like losing something or someone and stubbing your toe. Or someone to hold me and comfort me for no reason. But then I think about how I would probably hurt them. Bu I amleaing now. g
