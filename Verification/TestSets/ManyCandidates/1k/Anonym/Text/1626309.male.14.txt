continue to compete in the Med Games. These sanctions will not be revoked until the The United Socialist States of Angolistica agree to these terms. They will however be allowed to keep the weapons that were manufactured as long as the are never used again unless absolutely necssary.
Well, I finally come up with something to write after having this window open for at least 4 hours and nothing written. But now I have. Over the last few days, intelligence has come out that The United Socialist States of Angolistica, propsed a trade with The Kingdom of Edenburg for biologicial weapons. Edenburg however, declined and was just as shocked. This alarms me greatly, Freedomstaki will not stand for this. As everyone knows of the  urlLink Sahara Crisis , in which one of our low-yield nuclear weapons went off in the Sahara near The Republic of Tripolis, which sadly led to sanctions against us. The general in charge of this silo conviced his second in command with the other key that, that part was unocciuped and this was a rountine above ground testing, which acutally in pratice has not taken place since 1995. Anyways, Freedomstaki has today since frowned upon these actions of trading of WMDs or using them. I propsed to the UN, the Neutron Bomb Act which would remove low-yield nuclear weapons. Also, some actions agianst WMDs were acted upon the region, but I believe we need more. We need a Mediterranean version of the The Stuttgart Treaty. This could help ensure a long-lasting peace in the Mediterranean for maybe at least the next 50 years. Not only will this include nuclear weapons, but biological and chemicals weapons as well due the recent trading by Angolistica. This may even go further to prevent other weapons such as a Space Weapons Platform, such as in the fictional movie  GoldenEye .   I will write more about this later. That is all for now.
Man. I hurt so bad. I fell off the steps of the Executive Trailer on vacation this morning feeding the dog. I cut my elbow a bit and it's sore. That's pretty much it except for my butt that's all. Took to the boat for a spin. Wrote down some stuff to be recomenended for the legislature. That's pretty much for it today, except for the news that the Freedomstaki Spirit traded Nomar.
Welcome to the offical blog of me... Padraig Mannion, the Taoiseach of Freedomstaki, this is new age, 21st cnetury equivlent of weekly radio address, but now it's daily or even hourly, or whenever I feel like it or remember it. Yes, I'm lazy or I'm just to busy or tired to type a blog entry for here or I don't have something to write down. Not only does this allow my citizens and people to get and touch with me and become friends in some ways, but it allows other citzens of other countries to check up on the daily of us Freedomstakians. Anyways enough with the grand-opening discussion, hoopla and hubub.  LET'S GET ON WITH THE SHOW!!!      P
