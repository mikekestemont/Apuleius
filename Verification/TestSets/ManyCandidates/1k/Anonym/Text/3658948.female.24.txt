the real entertainment value was listening to my brother-in-law go off about tribal politics on his reservation. Actually, the politics on my rez are slightly worse, but I can practically guaruntee that every reservation has a few crazies installed in key areas of tribal government that make life miserable for damn near everyone else.  Anyway, it was fun. I never got around to the Coeur d'Alene pow-wow, but my brother-in-law says that there are very few vendors there, which is my main reason for going to pow-wows. I mostly like to check out the jewelry and beadwork, and occasionally eat an Indian taco, if it's worth it. Yeah, the dancing is fun to watch, too, but I prefer to move around and shop.
Fortunately, I found a place to live off-campus, but comfortably close by. Unfortunately, it's in a skeevy part of the city, and I've yet to see how clean it is. It's a one-room efficiency apartment, partially furnished with a security lock on the outside of the apartment. I doubt anything bad would happen, especially since&nbsp;I've resolved to be a lot more serious about college this time around. I'm trying to&nbsp;see my shitty neighborhood as incentive to get my ass home at a decent hour, so hopefully that'll stave off any weird incidents.  John McCain has been appearing on a string of talk shows recently; a few nights ago it was Jay Leno, before that, the Daily Show, that putz Tim Russert, etc. Despite his evident lack of&nbsp;improvisational humor, he's still a guilty pleasure. I've never seen McCain in full throttle, but stories from my brother-in-law (he was once involved in Indian gaming politics in Arizona, and has now moved back to his own rez) indicate his tantrums are really something to see. He's got that rare mix of guts and principles that I love to see in a politician, but I guess everybody has to play the game at some point. It's not the blatant lie, "I'd really like to see Bush get re-elected" that gets me, it's the footage of him during the Bush/Cheney ad that makes me ill, and his campaign appearances with Cheney that send me scurrying to the bathroom. Yeeeeech. As has been often stated in the media and exemplified in Cheney's own behavior (i.e., telling Leahy to fuck himself), he's an evil, conniving, inhuman prick -- can't McCain see that?? McCain's Wikipedia entry shows a picture of him in navy dress whites accepting his medals on crutches, his hair prematurely grey and his legs nearly folding beneath him. Contrast that with Cheney's statement regarding his activities during the Vietnam War ("I had&nbsp;more important&nbsp;things to do," or something along those lines), and it seems almost obscene that he's letting himself be pandered to the voting public in this way, with these people. I don't doubt his courage, integrity, or any of his other qualities&nbsp;that turned me into a secret McCainiac, but I do wonder why he's falling in with those freakshows.  Oh well. He's human, I guess, and even Paul Wellstone had his flaws.  S
