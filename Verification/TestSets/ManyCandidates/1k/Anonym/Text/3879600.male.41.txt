urlLink    Who knew a morning could start so beautifully? 8:30, cool, sunlight coming down from my east window and onto my small futon. I’m relaxed, well-rested, and happy. My roommate and I exchange pleasantries, offering each other the bathroom first. After checking email, I’m off to the  urlLink Keystone Cafe  for coffee, oatmeal, and a side of blueberries. I have my Superman T-shirt on, and I catch people smiling in a “he’s-got-guts” way. I read Lois Wadsworth’s  urlLink review of Spiderman 2  while waiting to eat. She says she didn’t like its violence. I didn’t feel the movie was too violent but then look mostly for story (it was, in my view and as Roger Ebert said, “ urlLink the best superhero movie since the modern genre was launched with Superman ”).    urlLink   I spend the rest of the morning reading around the apartment. I enjoy a story in  urlLink Gunn’s anthology  of British Sci Fi (“Dreams are Sacred,” by Peter Phillips, 1948 -- probably the first story in which someone visits another’s dreams with dire consequences.) Also, I read a  urlLink Ballard  story in the  urlLink Interzone anthology  {which contains the Amazon review of mine of that anthology} and (almost) finish Niven’s  urlLink Ringworld  (1970). Ringworld is much slower than I’d hoped, but I’m almost through. At the bank, the young Russian girl is sweet, as usual. She doesn’t mess my transaction up; I think she’s decided I’m not dangerous. I shop  urlLink   at the  urlLink Red Apple , my usual grocery place, and buy the new  urlLink lower-sugar Quaker  Brown-Sugar oatmeal. On the way home, I wait a while while a train goes by. I think about life and how everything’s perfect, and what I’m going to say during the men’s retreat in three weeks. I will try to have the words come directly from God, the only words of any value anyway.  urlLink Writers’ Group  meets at the park. We distinguish between the short story and novel format. Amy has a good start to a story. I read my poem,&nbsp; urlLink The Lioness , and we discuss its problems,  urlLink   strengths. Sharon discusses Ian Watson’s  urlLink Mockymen  (2003), which she’s enjoying. We read a few passages from Henry Miller’s  urlLink Tropic of Capricorn . Then I finish by reading a short part of  urlLink Rust Hills’ book on short story . I feel like I do too much of the talking, though most of it is reading to the group. I’m flattered they like my reading voice and will keep trying to please them.  I watch the Director’s Cut of the movie  urlLink The Butterfly Effect . I was amazed. It was so much better than expected -- brilliant writing. (A warning, if you haven’t seen it:&nbsp;Watch the Director’s Cut first. It has an entirely different (and better) ending than the theatrical version. True science fiction vs. Hollywood hack.)  &nbsp;  My landlord calls during the movie. He and I will meet. I have rent mostly together. Before going to bed, I write my first blog e
