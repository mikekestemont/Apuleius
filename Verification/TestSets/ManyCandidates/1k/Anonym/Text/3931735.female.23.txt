need help through life.&nbsp; I know it was great for me to have Christy there mentoring me when I was in high school.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I miss Christy.&nbsp; She and her family moved to Portland for a season.&nbsp; She sent me a nice thank you letter for the scrapbook I made for her and Doug.&nbsp; I hope they are doing great.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Okay, I need to get back to work.&nbsp; I just wanted to blog because I won't be able to all weekend.&nbsp;
How did I come to start a blog?  Well, my husband Benjie just emailed me a link to our friend Rudy's blog.  It was his thoughts on our wedding (almost one year ago...July 19, 2003).  I had read Rudy's blog before, but this time I saw "Start Your Own" and clicked on it.  So now here I am with a blog.  Maybe it will be read by others, maybe just me.  I think it will be kind of fun, and cool to have an online record of life.  Today I am sick, so I am going to go take a hot shower now and go to bed.
Wow, a lot has happened since the last time I blogged.  The house is nearly finished being worked on.  The hallway floor just needs to be stained.  Sharon came back from Russia today!  Unfortunately, Benjie has to work all night, so he won't even see her today.  At work, I have been training people to use the new timeclock and online system.  It has been going better than I expected.  Change usually goes over hard.  We'll see how it goes when people start punching in on Monday.  Kelly had decided to drop out of SALT to do something on her own.  That is a MAJOR bummer.  She has a lot of passion, but I wish she could have the patience to stick with this group.  However, she no longer feels like it is something she wants to do, or that God even wants her to do.  So, maybe God will do something great through her somewhere else.  I hope so.  But I am still bummed.  At least I will still get to have time with her in our discipleship group that I am starting with her and Danielle.  I start school in 2 weeks, I think.  I joined Curves a week ago.  My first week was great.  I think I like it, and I already feel like I have more energy!  It is great!  We got our wedding pictures back from Jason.  That is cool.  There were a few missing prints, so we will get those soon.  I am currently reading Crime and Punishment.  Everyone speaks in exclamations!  Like this!  All the time!  What else?  Mom and Dani got a kitty!  He is so cute!  His name is Captain Jack and he is an orange tabby and very frisky and playful.  Awwww!  Tomorrow we are going to Marine World.  We are missing Grandpa's birthday dinner though.  :(  That is not good.  Benjie is working all night tonight so that he can go tomorrow.  :
