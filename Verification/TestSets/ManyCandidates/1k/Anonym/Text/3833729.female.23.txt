goes an Advil out form the closet. In and out of your ears is your mom’s early morning lecture. Do you wanna talk about it? She asks. A big gulp of milk to wash down that oily egg concoction. It all wants to come out again. It’s a weekend. Weekends mean no work… no greasy fingers and dirty tool boxes and screwdrivers that you turn and turn, ‘til your hands hurt and bleed and makes you not want to see another mechanical tool ever again.  Relief. An escape from the things that occupy you and makes you forget. Forget about your past. And how it betrayed you. Forget about how we all face hard times in our lives. Like what your brother said. It’s a weekend. And you remember well on weekends.   I made you stand up from where you were sitting. I threw your Jack Daniels and Marlboro 100’s in the trash. I caught your attention from staring into empty space. I gave you your life back again. And gave you company. I made you forget everything that is putting your life on hold. I set you in motion. I set you free.  Don’t go back into the dark… it gets so scary sometimes.
Tell me how much it hurts... and I will say to you I'm sorry. Show me how much I betrayed you... and I will calm you down as if to a lake. Should I turn back now and leave you to the wolves? Or protect you with all my love and soul? The latter seems more appropriate... but that is not to be deliberated. I give you my pain that which is love... and I give you my hell that which is my soul. Ease my suffering by easing the pain. Take me out from hell by cleansing my soul. I will give you my all while you owe me nothing in return. And this is how much I love you.  Kiss me when you see me... and I shall writhe in pain for it will be death to depart from you afterwards...  my love.
This morning I woke up with the smell of toasted bread and melted butter, with the strong scent of brewed coffee on a hot teapot. Quiet. Airless. Humid. Hot. My body is sweaty all over. My thoughts are throwing off pictures of yesterday’s events. Tears. Pain. Sufferring. Betrayal. The hurt in her eyes were unbearable. Sorry. Not enough. Her tail lights shining brightly while she cried on her way home. I know she did. Leaving. How can I bear the thought of losing her… never! Hot coffee on a teacup is strange, but then again, I am hungry. One sip, one bite. And I see her face in my mind. Will we ever have breakfast together again? When the door swung open I knew it’s time to go. It’s 7 o’clock in the evening, and my morning bird now sings, and it’s time to go to work once more. I will be waiting…  &nbsp;  you are my first thought in the mornings.&nbsp; &
