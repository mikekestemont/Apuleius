I just read in the Boston Globe that Washington state has legalized same-sex marriage. Washington is one of the 38 states that had ruled marriage is a union between one man and one woman, but a judge in Seattle ruled that denying marriage to these couples is a violation of their constitutional rights.   urlLink Click here  for the link to the article.
Donna Ann! That's horrible! im with cait in that im glad nobody got hurt - i could make some bad retarded jokes right now but i wont.  so here's my day - just to make u feel a little better but it's not as bad as yours!!! Today i was swimming some laps to cool down after such a hot day (and MAN WAS IT HOT! No ac and no fan at work makes for one unhappy krissy!) anyway...i was swimming and was in the shallow end - and my dog fell in the deep end.  well i panicked and set out after him and got him out in the nick of time - but not without twisting some muscle in my back because of how i turned and how hard i was pulling to get there in time since he can't get out of the pool.  but all is well.  ahhh yeah, and there was a frog in the pool too.... it's like my own little zoo!  this is my last week of school for the summer.... then one week of work and 2 of vacation! yippee.  went to a comedy club in the city on friday which was really great.  it was only 15 dollars and with a computer printed coupon it was 2 for 1 with no drink/food minimum.  annnd the comedians were funny and the show was long. anyway, i liked it - dee and d we should go one day.  that's all i have to say. got to search the net for lessons on "america's monuments" = anyone got an idea cause i ahve none. love to you all! k
