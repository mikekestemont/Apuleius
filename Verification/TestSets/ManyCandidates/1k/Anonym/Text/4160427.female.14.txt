well today was an 'A' day i guess it was better than wednesday, but still not very comforting. i had a really bad headache all day and to add to the pain of that my back was killing me from carrying like ten pounds of book in my back pack and sitting in the weird chairs that are completly different from the ones that i got used to at MMHS. anyways, at lunch i was sitting at the table i have sat at everyday so far and it got really crowded for some reason and a guy at the table in from of me pushed his backpack on to the ground and it like hit my feet and he looked at me and i looked at him and went back to reading and a girl at that table, im assuming it was one of his friends kinda pissed me off. she said in a really bitchie tone 'why the hell is she reading at lunch? god, i just hate the kinda of people who do stuff like that.' argg i wanted to just yell 'STFU you f***ing rude bitch'...but i kept calm and acted as if i hadnt heard her, arent you proud? the rest of the day went okay though as far as people and the classes went. we had our first lecture in history, watched a pottery movie in ceramics, took a diagnostic test in biology (i didnt know  any of it , it looked familiar but i didnt remember it from seventh grade) and in english i read the summer reading book that i didnt know i would have to read and all the other people were writing their AP essays... kinda awkward but whatever works, right? well im gunna go now, maybe i will post on my xanga, maybe not... love ya and ttfn(tatafornow) Caitlin
