front of you. yet you have sent Jesus Christ from heaven to save us from our sins.. thank you God!  i really hope to do something different in my life.. to help people, poor people..sick people.. people in dire straits.. instead of helping companies and corporates to earn more money, that would sucks!only thing i need to do is to be brave and face obstacles and make sacrifices to do so... we all have too many burdens and resposibles in this life that doesn't do anyone else good except ourselves.
my friend once said that blog is just a journal to keep track with our own crapy life...! well, he was right in some sense :) writing a blog sometimes is like talking to oneself. this morning woke up at 9... well.. who cares...
feel like not doing anything but rest... the thesis really is a burden that is in my mind all the time. there is so many homework to do but i just couldn't have the heart to do it. what is happening to me? i should be doing my homework rather than writing this blog! am i pretendtious? am i a hypocrite like all the others that i thought to be hypocrite? i feel confused sometimes.  damn.. i'm really tired.. got to take some rest and tomorrow morning i'll do my best, i hope i can put all my effort in my homework, cause is my responsibility.
Haha, today i finally learn how to publish my photo with the Hello software! my God it was so easy but i took me few hours to figure out how exactly to put my photo on to the blog. right now, i still don't know how to put a picture on the profile :p, hope i learn soon.... i learn things pretty slow.  slept the whole afternoon, feel rejuvenated... but depressed at the same time, cause when u sleep, is like going to another dimension, a new world where no one would bother you!(execpt for nightmares! haha) but when you wake up, no matter how much slept you've got, welcome back to reality :( there are loads of things waiting for us to do. i'm not a slacker, is just that the strike of reality is kind of cruel to me.  well, no matter how, i believe God would lead me through any obstacles in my life, which currently i have alot! :( pray!
