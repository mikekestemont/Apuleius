posting here at home!  Finally I am home yet I am leaving Friday to go chill with Jana and Nee in Altoona!  I had an intersting time at darin lake!  I am wating to here from someone special to me still! I am gonna work on gettin a picture on here while I am home tomarrow! But for now I am out!  PEACE!
I have a boyfriend Yet I seam to be attracted to other guys The one I want is the one I cant have The one I have seams not to have time for me The one who has time for me and wants to be with me Yeah I am wating for him to call me back And unlike the one I have he does call back! So the question is what to do and who do I really want to be with I know the answer but I cant have what I want! So then I suppose I should take my second best offer And break up with the one who is not good for me!
Randy and I are not really in a relationship I would say.  Because we never see eachother and I seam to see other guy freinds of mine more.  I dont know what to do!  I need to talk to him!
I am still wating for Randy to call me back I swear that boy does not know the meaning of I promise!  I hope he calls sometime!  I would like to see him!  Ya know having a boyfriend is more trouble than I thought!  I have not decied what I like to do more, be single or be in a realtionship.  I suppose if my relationship was a bit more communication freindly it would be better.  But ya take what ya can get!
Today I am hoping to see Randy!
I am happy as can be! I am hoping that Randy and I still have plans for tomarrow! I really want to spend sometime with him! I relly really really want to! UGH....Just to think Band Camp starts monday!...YUCK! But this weekend will ROCK! Friday-Buffalo for Uncle Ricks Birthday Party! Saturday- Off to Erie for School clothes shopping! For now being bored as hell watching televisoion!
Last night Randy and I started dating!  I am so happy!  I want a longterm relatoinship.  I hope he and I last for a long long time!
Well lets see not many things going on lately just staying home an doing nothing much.  Just woring about boys.  And actually for once they both are great guys.  Randy was to call me and never did but hey I am not going to hold anything aginst him.  Maybe he had to go somewhere.  I will hopefully talk to him soon and I hope he feels the same about me as I feel.  Because I would like to date him.  And Josh and I do feel the same for eachother.  But he made a valid point.  We should not date,  we should just be friends, until school starts that way we can see eachother m
