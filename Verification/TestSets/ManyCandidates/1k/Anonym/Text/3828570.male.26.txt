A brand new (and quite glowing) review of my short film,  Outcasts , was just published online.   urlLink Link   Here are a couple of excerpts:   To my delight,  the film works in its simplicity—it is intelligently made,  thoughtfully written, and it successfully updates Christ’s  brief parable of the Good Samaritan. I think the carpenter from  Nazareth would have been proud at how well Boatright translates  what is arguably his most famous parable. ...  With Outcasts, Boatright reveals himself to be a talented  artist with a message. He has made a short, to-the-point film  that will certainly challenge Christians to think outside of  the comfort zones, as well as let the rest of the world know  that not all Christians are as over-zealous as some of the characters  featured in this film. The film is so effective in its simplicity,  I am left with no doubt that If Christ had come today, he would  have directed short films.
Hello all...this is just a random update to let you know some of what's going on:  First, we've started post production on Sinners and You, and from what I can tell, it's going to be a hilarious film.  Pictures are still forthcoming....  Second, we're looking into having a local short film night here in Chattanooga at a great new coffeeshop/internet cafe called Cafe Aroma.  It's a Christian-owned cafe (and we want to make this kid-friendly), so we're looking for relatively wholesome content, but we will be taking submissions from the public.  Email me if you're interested.  Third, Jamie Watts and I have started developing the story for the "As of Yet Untitled DOA Remake", which will most likely be BBP's first feature.  We're keeping many details under wraps, but we can tell you that we're looking at setting the film in Savannah, Ga.  Fourth, we've been invited to submit some of our work to the first annual Firefly Film Festival (Oct 1, 2004), hosted by the University of Tennessee here in Chattanooga.  In addition to Outcasts, we plan on sending Sinners and You, which means it will probably be its first public viewing.  The venue will be Club Fathom on Market Street, so if you're in the area, make plans to come by.  Finally,  this weekend ProjectGod.com will be releasing my most recent directorial work...a short film called "Heredity."  Be sure to swing by the site and check it out.  That's it for now....stay tuned for more.  (Also...I've added a few new links to the right...check em' out.)
This week we shot yet another original production from the Beamish Boy, a satirical spoof called  Sinners and You .  Using the most scientific time tested propaganda devices, the film explains how to clearly identify and avoid "Sinners"....which are, unfortunately, a menace that exists all around us.  SnY was written by Justin Tarlton and directed by Chris Bookless.  Post production is beginning now, and the film should be festival ready within a month.  We'll have pictures s
