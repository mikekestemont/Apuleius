lower back tatoo that catch the boys eyes when i sit a certain way in the library). He was trying to pick me up but failing miserably- to my surprise who should introgect into the conversation to help me- my little atlerna-teen savior. If i hadnt have been drunk i wouldnt have known what to say to him. The thing is- we had a very close mutual friend and we should have met SOoO long before this. Maybe it was better that it finally happened this way- I was really pleased with the circumstances- the liquid courage was pumping through my veins and i decided to screw the fact that i had a boyfriend and he had a girlfriend- i was kissing those shinny pink lips if it was the last thing I did. So we talked music and who knows what else until we realized 'we should get out of here' and decided to go back to hot-pants' house. And when we got to his house- wrong as it was- we kissed and kissed and kissed... Such soft sweet kisses- tenderness with a stranger is so confusing. Guys, if you really want drama in your life, treat all strange girls you make out with like your girlfriend. I broke up with my boyfriend the next day but ignored the boy i had done it because of as much as possible- hed walk one way and id turn to avoid his path. I knew i was in trouble because im not shy with people normally. Actually under normal conditions im out going to a fault. Its just that I had this huge huge crush and didnt know what to do. Halloween came around and he invited me to a party at his house. I dressed up as a kitty and wore the highest of heels and tighest of shirts I had. God was he adorable and not too long into the night I was on his lap and we were stealing kisses once again. I wanted him to be mine- all mine and then it dawned on me- hitting me like a ton of bricks... he wasnt single. SoOo wrong of me to be doing this!  In a drunken stupor I left- but not before yelling about how 'i stopped chasing boys with girlfriends a long time ago,' turning, nearly falling off the high horse id been screaming from, and marching out of his kitchen. It was our first official fight. I think it should have been seen as a bad sign that we started out by cheating- were fighting before we were dating- and I was already convinced he was the dullest boyfriend ever. But have you ever just had a feeling that you'd be missing out if you paid attention to your better judgement? Thank god I ignored what my brain was saying....
