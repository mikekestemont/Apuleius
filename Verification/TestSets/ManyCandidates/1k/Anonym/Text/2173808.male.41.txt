 Down-ticket Republican candidates must be getting very worried.  With Kerry likely to win handily and with Obama looking at a blowout, they have to be thinking that they might just get swept away in dual landslides.    Also, what happened to the idea of running a sports figure?  Just because Mike Ditka and Dave Duerson turned them down doesn't mean they can't find someone else?  What are Minnie Minoso and William "Refrigerator" Perrry up to these days?  Here's another thought--two cast members of the movie "Predator" have already been elected to statewide office (Arnold and Jesse Ventura).  I say try going 3 for 3 by nominating Carl Weathers.
This is truly beyond my capacity for satire. First a guy into threesomes (note: I wish we had a legal system that would prevent me from knowing this). Now a man best known for losing miserably in a Senate race in Maryland and stage diving during his preposterous run for the Republican presidential nomination. That said, I would certainly skip watching The Simple Life to see an Obama-Keyes debate...
To help get some more ideas going, I've asked my friend Steve Teles to join me as a contributor to PolySigh.  Steve is an Assistant Professor of Politics at Brandeis University.  He has previous taught at having held previous positions at Hamilton College (where he was in my job for a one-year visiting stint), Harvard, the University of London, Holy Cross College and Boston University. He is the author of  urlLink  Whose Welfare: AFDC and Elite Politics  (1996, rev. ed. 1998)  and numerous articles on such topics as the logic of policy analysis, US-China relations, the politics of affirmative action in Britain, and the social mobility of British ethnic minorities. As you can see he's very narrow in his approach to politics!  He is currently at work on a book entitled  Parallel Paths:The Evolution of the Conservative Legal Movement , which is under contract with Princeton University Press. He is an avid skiier and hopes to drop ten pounds by the times the lifts open in November.
Hi...first post on this site. Just for full disclosure purposes, I should provide a bit of background on who I am. I'm a political scientist--that is, I probably qualify as a "discrete, insular minority" in the legal sense of the term. I'm a Democrat. Broken down further, I'm: a) quite hawkish on foreign policy; b) relatively liberal on redistributive issues; c) quite rabidly free trade and suspicious of other policy tools that distort markets (such as most tax deductions, agricultural subsidies, and command and control regulation); d) generally suspicious of the role of courts in policy disputes and; e) relatively conservative on "social control" issues (like crime and welfare reform) but fairly liberal on lifestyle issues (like gay marriage, which I'm for--if it's passed by a legislature, opposed if imposed by judicial diktat). So that's enough for you to figure out where I'm coming from.
As you can see, I've posted a running tally of electoral votes based on the most recent state polls.  The counter comes courtesy of  urlLink electoral-vote.com .
