wait until November.  So that was it, and my mom had left already. So I first went to the restroom then walked around and ended up outside in the front of the school. It was around 8:00 and the morning was very hot and humid and there was very little shade. But I waited until 9:00 and finally gave up and called my mom to pick me up. Cause I was not about to wait until the usual time she picked me up i.e. 10:00.  Anyways a very  funky  feeling started coming up around my stomach...yes it was the diarrhea.

Well I think people should see what I really look like and decided to add my picture. Don't be frightened by my appearance that's normal. Anyway be gentle if you ever do come across my face :( *sob*
Well Sunday I left to San Antonio to enlist in the Marines.  It was really hot in the shuttle and I was in the back and really packed........but next to a chick!  We lasted 5 hours in that van and finally got in to the hotel I find out that I wasn't in the list and had to wait and finally was given the card to go to my room.  I left my stuff in the room and me and the other guy that wasn't in the list looked around the hotel for all the rest of the people but couldn't find them.  I finally saw my roomate and he told me where the place to eat was.  I ate porkchops with mashed potatoes.  I then went to my room and changed so I could go to the excercise room and did the bicycle thing then the treadmill thing for an hour.  While in their I met a couple of guys and one guy helped me with the running t
