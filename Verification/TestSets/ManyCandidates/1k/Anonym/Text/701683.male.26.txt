the prodigal son?  Have you wanted to do things your own way?    Let me encourage you to drop it.  Times are crazy right now in the world.  You're hearing all kinds of noise and temptations, just as Indiana did in those brief moments.  But listen for that soothing, penetrating voice of the Father saying "Junior...Son....Daughter...give me your other hand."  Reach up and grab your Father's hand before it's too late.
Calmer than the sky Far away so blue Land of living God Grant your peace on earth  We can feel you move And cannot stay the same The winds are blowing strong God of heaven come  Breathe peace Breathe your peace on us So we might breathe you deep Breathe peace Breathe your peace on us The land of the living God  If we are in the way  Move us to the side God forgive our wrongs Rest your hands on us  All the world is yours Let us not forget It was you who bore the cross                           --R. Seay   Peace.  In times like these, there's no doubt that peace is much needed, but it seems to be scarcely sought with earnest.  Living in Waco, TX, I see my share of pro-Bush, pro-War supporters.  On the flipside, there's a good number of anti-war persons who make their voice heard.  I find my head spinning more and more as the tension seems to grow daily!   Where do we go from here?   Those in favor of war use the desire for the establishment of peace as part of their justification, while those against war stand on the argument that war brings not peace but destruction and distrust.  My own views are irrelevant at this point.  For right now, all I want is peace.  And I'm not talking about the absence of struggle that we so often define peace as being.  Regardless of whether or not we go to war, there will always be struggle.  I'm talking about the peace that Frederick Buechner describes as being "the presence of love."  It is the same love that covers a multitude of sins.  The same love that is driven by self-sacrifice and humility.  The same love that is defined by both the turning of the other cheek as well as the confronting of those who wish to disgrace God's temple.  It is that very love that looked on the lost and ruined condition of all humanity and rejected the idea of giving up on it.  Rather, this love gallantly rode into earth as the Prince of Peace....as a defenseless Jewish infant in a stable.  So is it on this love that we finally figure out peace?  I would say yes....YES!    It is with this declaration that I encourage you with the lyrics posted at the beginning of this entry:  Lord,if we are in the way, move us to the side.  Remind us that all the world is yours.  Its our hope that we can feel you move and cannot stay the same.  God of heaven come!  Breathe peace.  Breathe Your peace on us.   Peace for the n
