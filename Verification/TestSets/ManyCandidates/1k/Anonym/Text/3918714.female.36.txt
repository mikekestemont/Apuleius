she is.      I have so much to do and there doesn't seem to be enough hours in the day. I have between now and the first of December about 6 cross-stitch projects, a half a dozen books to read and prepare discussions for, group discussions....And that is only on-line. I want to read more my book collection I believe is up to 180 books and more keep adding themselves to the group.      I need a break. I want to go to my sister in law's baby shower but can't go it's too far from here. "oh, I think I'll have some cheese with my whine!" Well, I must be off...I have to check out blogs of a couple friends, update my wish list, and prepare my new database for my cross-stitching stash. Oh, gosh! I need to check out Writerspace.com for the new contest and enter them. Okay it will be another long night. Plus, I just realized I need to finish up When He Was Wicked by Julia Quinn. I'm going to hate giving it away but no choice in the matter. More cheese please.      Huggles to all and thanks for listening .......Marta
I need to blog today. It's been a while and yet still no time to devote to it. I have found myself very busy with with 2 adventures: Cross-Stitching (including the message board) and my CatMystery board (a moderator, leader of discussion, etc.) I love to read but I find as of late that working with my hands to create a beautiful piece of art work (cross-stitch) is very gratifying. Therefore, once again my historical romance passion is on the back burner on low heat. I'm happy just wish I had more time in the day.          But in a few weeks, my littlest one will be off to school 3 mornings a week. I hope to use that time for sewing, reading, physical activity, house cleaning....Things that are easier to accomplish without her willing fingers. God love her!          I had a wonderful surprise yesterday, Leya (wandeca - hope I remembered correctly) sent me a July in Christmas package - 3 books by Julia London: Beauty Queen, highlander Unbound &amp; Material Girl. The box also included a vanilla candle - yummy, post cards (which I love to mail to people) and a book mark (roses - my tattoo passion). Then I rec'd another book for my CatMystery group - Familiar Series and the beautiful historical cross-stitch.         The cross-stitch is called The Kiss. It would be a beautiful romance novel cover. It shows a lovely lady holding a cascading boutique of roses and the giver is behind her kissing the side of her neck. Romantic! I must figure out how to put pictures on this site, so you may see it. There is a whole series of these cross-stitches, I would love to have them all.         I best be off for now - mornings is my time before Sunshine wakes up. A little time to drink coffee, read, sew or watch the world start it's day. Huggles and Take C
