that i am invited to reapply in TWO years.   TWO YEARS?!  two years.  hmm.  so that's left me to wonder, am i going to get DQed by other departments and get "invited to apply" (doesn't that make the blow seem less?  yeah, it certainly does.  good choice of words, Sarg) in TWO years as well???   so right now.....i'm trying to figure out what i'm going to do.  my friend and training partner vassie is going to talk to Gold's Gym down in San Diego to see if he can hook me up with a sales counselor position, which would be great because it pays well, you get free membership, and on my days off and hours off, i can work out!  :)  (i know, i'm a gym-rat, really, it's sad.)  here are my options:  move down to SD, transfer macaroni grills, stay with karvin, keep looking for jobs while going through police testing with Oxnard, Oceanside, Escondido, and possibly Newport Beach....and go on from there.  (which means i'll be in SD, nearly permanently.)  stay in Vegas, keep roadtripping back and forth from here to SD for testing, which is incredibly time-money consuming, and does not go well with my employers here...  pick my stuff up and just move back to Blacksburg.  i don't know what to do.   meanwhile, as you've noticed if you've been watching my posts, i've been drawing a whole lot of anti-drug stuff.  it's all body for my graphic novel, "The Raindrop Branches," a story about a young girl who falls in love with a boy who becomes addicted to methamphetamines.  this is somewhat autobiographical of my friend Dan and myself, but some things are different which is why it is fiction.   but the emotions are quite familiar...  losing someone to drugs is hard.  it's like watching someone you love slit their wrists slowly - normally it would take a couple hours for them to die, but instead, it is elongated to a period of weeks or months.   as i mentioned earlier, my friend nicole's site:   urlLink http://www.inkyndallsname.org   i really want to get involved with some kind of drug-free/anti-drug nonprofit organization...if i could get work in that arena that would be perfect.  my long-time mentor dr. bob wrote me and is encouraging me to apply to LAPD and LA County Sheriff's Dept.  but LA County requires you to work 4 years in the jails before you move on to anything else, and there is a really high turnover rate at LAPD, which can't be good.  i'm not fond of the idea....just yet.   *sigh* friends, please pray for me!  i need a little direction here.  time to go gym.  but first i think i'll go to kinko's and scan in the heroin poster i finished today.
urlLink    another new meth poster featuring ophelia.   urlLink     did this one a couple of days ago.  i've been drawing quite a bit, and actually have a new poster to post here soon.  it's a heroin poster that i made for my new friend nicole who made this website for her sister:   urlLink http://www.inkyndallsname.org .
