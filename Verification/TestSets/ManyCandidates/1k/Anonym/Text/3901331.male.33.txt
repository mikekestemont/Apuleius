can’t even speak English." – Booster.  "Trying to hit on female mangers and not get fired." – Solomon
What is it that you dont like about tech support?   The customers.  I am not asking them to be fucking geniuses.  I am just asking that they have some common sense.  They dont even have that!  Johnny Silo  Getting interrupted while I am playing Unreal Tournament.  The database recovery prodigal fucking crashes it every time.  Cant these customer even wait till after 12 to call us?  Turk  Getting interrupted.  The customers are always thumping my killzone.  Booster  Having to come up with a last minute desperate solution to an impossible problem created by another person.  Unfortunately, I must do that a lot.  Solomon   How did you get your nick names?   I used to always joke I had a silo in my pants.  I was a little bit of a ladies man until work got so much.  Youre not going to print that, right?  Johnny Silo I think Solomon gave me the nickname of Turk.  He said I looked like Timothy Hutton and I think he stared in movie called Turk 162 or some damn thing.  Hell, I aint seen it.  Turk  My nickname was always Booster.  It comes from me having the ability to use both hands mostly when I am supporting our customers.  I earned the nickname Master Chief when I beat all the guys at Halo. That game fucking rocks!  Booster.  Solomon is my dogs name.  Im kidding.  Solomon is my middle name but I hardly use it much.  My nickname used to be God, but a very nice lady I worked with is highly religious so I changed it for her.  The reason the boys called me God is that I simply knew everything.  Customer looses his database or its corrupted, he mails it in to me to fix.  When he is praying for his data to be recovered, who do you think hes praying to?  Me!  Solomon
Thumping The Killzone  (Metaphor);// The description of when a tech support person is being interrupted by a customer while they are in the middle of an activity, most commonly a video game. i.e.,  I almost got through level 6!  This bitch is thumping my killzone!    Hello, everybody.  My name is David Overmind.  During the time frame of March of 2003, I conducted interviews with a group of men working in a tech support facility.  So that these men can keep their jobs, I have not mentioned their company name nor who they work for.  They already had nicknames so we will be using those when we refer to them as individuals.  This blog will allow these men to vent their frustrations, praise and some times, utter distain for their job.  Their clique even has a name of it’s own.  They are the  Lords of Hot Town .  Johnny Silo  Turk  Master Chief Booster  Solomon or more commonly known as The Artist Formerly Known as God  The interviews will begin shortly.    We are going to stand b
