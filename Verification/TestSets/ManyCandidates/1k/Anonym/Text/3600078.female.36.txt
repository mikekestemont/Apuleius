songs I've started. I know none of it is crucial to the turning of the world on its axis, but I promised myself this year I would keep writing and not let that part of my life wither away again. And with that thought in mind, it's hard not to think about the time I wasted in the last few years with negative things - but I think I can chalk all of it up as character-building and inspiration for a better life. No sense dwelling on the past, right?  So much to do!
You know, I honestly don't know that much about John.  I met him in the last creative writing class I took, and at first I thought "Oh, just some retiree who wants to make the most of the time on his hands.  How quaint."  But as the weeks passed and we we were all sharing our writings and thoughts and critiques, it became very clear that John was not an ordinary man.  First of all, he's a Federal judge appointed during the Clinton administration.  He still is a judge, and works downtown where I am welcome to visit him at any time.  I think he's in his late 70's, has a very halting eloquence when he speaks, and has indicated during class discussions that he's had quite the wild history, particularly during the 1960's during the White Panther era.  It's hard to imagine when you look at him.  He just looks like someone's grandfather who's had a white collar job most of his career and enjoys playing with model trains in his old age.  He's a large man, mostly white hair, and has an utterly charming humor about him.  I always enjoyed talking to him, or just letting him speak about things he's done or witnessed.  I may have a chance to get to know John better in the next few months.  I ran into the instructor for that class during aerobics, and she had told me they had started a writer's workshop at her house - totally informal and away from CCS.  John comes and shares his fascinating memories and experiences from the 60's via his short stories and poems, not really ever concluding anything but capturing his audience nonetheless.  She tells me she has been up to his cottage to stay with him and his wife, and she saw photos of when he was younger.  Apparently, he was quite handsome in his day, so the hints of his being a rogue in his day aren't too far-fetched.  I will probably start going to these workshops also, which will help discipline me with my writing again.  I think he still longs for those days of rampant wanton behavior.  Perhaps he regrets settling down, or perhaps, like the rest of us, there was nothing to do but accept age as it came and embrace the other things life had to offer:  his marriage, children, grandchildren, etc.  Nothing lasts forever, but you can certainly be grateful life offers a variety of experiences at any age.  Sure...I say that n
