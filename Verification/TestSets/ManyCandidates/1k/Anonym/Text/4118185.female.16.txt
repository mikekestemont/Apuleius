you can be wrong.  Sometimes you can call someone you're best-friend, accidents happen.  I have never been one to talk behind someones back. I have never felt it a good way to release any type of stress that or tensions they have put on me. Yet I had a friend(best if you will) once, who did that to me. Who used words such as "He, him, that guy" to describe me so that I wouldn't know.   I'm not stupid .  I decided to rant about this, because it has been bothering me for quiet the time now. Being unable to fully express what I mean on my other blog didn't help either. So let me sum up what I mean,  Fuck you . In simplest way, I just want to walk up to him, and stick my middle finger in the middle of his face. About 1 year, and all it's been is good time after good-time. To trash it like this and now. Our friendship was built on the beach, and then a 40 ft. tsunami blew it to the center of california. In a matter of days it shambled, mainly because he just assumed too much. Yet i said today, about awhile ago, that because he asked nicely, or because he was going to  bitch  about it, he wouldn't control me with constant nuisance and chilidish sub-messages. Hopefully you run into another person who'll stick by you, because as far as I can see, we're done. Posting on my blog about what you think I feel for someone, when you can't even express yourself is something of an unorthodox approach.  Too bad pal, we where destined to be great. Hell, I would have took a bullet for you.  -Cheers,   Rod
I'm moving away from xanga. Good-bye xanga.  It sucked anyways.  It was ugly, it was sloppy, it was everything I didn't want. I really want a journal. The old one will still be up, but I won't update ever again.  I'm happy that i'm with Jess now. Even if it ends another friendship, it's not my fault, I can't help but feel attracted to sweet people. Yet if this is how it's going to end, then let it be, because I will NOT give up something this great because someone else feels like they're going to cry.   Cry me a river.      I don't care.   I'm going to try to actually do what I set off to do with my orginal Blog. Which ended up being garbage compared to what I felt really. Yes I tried to think about making my posts private, but why should I censor myself to please other people? I don't, and I won't. So this xanga might be a little harsh, so if feelings get hurt-live with it.  Am I sorry about it? Will I be sorry about it?   No.   This wasn't forced upon you, i never force fed you the link. So you came on your own accord and if it upset you then i'd suggest you leave. Good god am I dick.  -Cheers,   R
