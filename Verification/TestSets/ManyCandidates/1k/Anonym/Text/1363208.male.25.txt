love out of nothing at all   Making love  Out of nothing at all  Making love  Out of nothing at all  Making love  Out of nothing at all  Making love  Out of nothing at all  Making love  Out of nothing at all  Making love  Out of nothing at all   Everytime I see you, well the rays of the sun are all  Streaming through the waves in your hair  And every star in the sky is taking aim at your eyes  Like a spotlight  The beating of my heart is a drum and it’s lost  And it’s looking for a rhythm like you  You can take the darkness from the deep of the night  And turn it to a beacon burning endlessly bright  I gotta follow it ‘cause everything I know  Well, it’s nothing ‘till I give it to you   I can make the runner stumble  I can make the final block  And I can make every tackle at the sound of the whistle  And I can make all the stadiums rock&nbsp;   I can make tonight forever  Or I can make it disappear by the dawn  And I can make you every promise that’s ever been made  And I can make all your demons be gone   But I’m never gonna make it without you  Do you really wanna see me crawl ?  And I’m never gonna make it like you do  Making love out of nothing at all   Making love  Out of nothing at all...
[mood:&nbsp; swinging]  [listening to: Radiohead - Creep ]  [current project: ]     Creep    Radiohead    &nbsp; When you were here before, couldn't look you in the eye You're just like an angel, your skin makes me cry You float like a feather In a beautiful world And I wish I was special You're so very special But I 'm a creep, I 'm a weirdo What the hell am I doing here I don't belong here I don't care if it hurts, I want to have control I want a perfect body, I want a perfect soul I want you to notice When I'm not around You're so&nbsp;very &nbsp;special I wish I was special She's running out again She's running out .... Whatever makes you happy Whatever you want You're so&nbsp;very &nbsp;special I wish I was special... But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here I don't belong here.
Siapa Di Hatimu   Terasa bagai ditusuk sembilu bisa  Pedihnya entah bila akan terhenti  Berkasih di rimba asmara berapi  Terbakar hanya ku sendiri  Oh mengapa?...   Kemana hilang janji dan sumpah setia  Kemana tumpah selaut harum kasturi  Apakah mungkin kan terulang kembali  Asyiknya cinta bagai dulu?  Atau serapuhnya mimpi yang pulang pagi?   Semakin ingin aku lupakan  Dan semakin bayang wajahmu kan menjelma  Dimana kah puncanya derita  Ku sendiri tidak pasti, sayang.   Siapa merebut seri cinta  Waktu aku buka jendela  Dikeheningan pagi indah   Siapa sejambak mawar merah  Harum dikamar hatimu  Hingga diriku disingkirkan   Redup senja dikaki malam  Menghilangkan warnai lalang  Dan cinta kini bagaikan berkasihan mimpi      Lagu ciptaan : Wan Zul  Lirik : Siso  Nyanyian: R
