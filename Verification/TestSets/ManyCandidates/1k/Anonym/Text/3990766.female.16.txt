not know and he is talking on phone with me till it reaches 12am it's my birthday and i thought he would want to sing me a b day song but end up he say to put down phone le.. haiz..  but i never thought of it.. he sms me ask me to open my door and i sneak out to open my door secretly as i do not want to wake my parents up.. to my suprise i saw him standing there holding a big bag.. jus like a santa clause and wanted to give me my b day present.. i'm really touch and shock.. i would never forget my special 15th b day... i knew he is made to be a gd bf but.. soon all this nice and sincere really did made me touch and i decide to give him a chance and we start steading..we seems like went through so much feng feng yu yu and we still together.. i still remember when i was working at kfc last year,end of the year holidays he will feng yu bu gai ,no matter what he will come and accompany me home till i reach my door.. then he go home.. i'm really touch and glad wat he did for me.. he told me he is a impatient person and yet he willing to wait for me so long whenever i finishing my work and also whenever i was late when i meet him..  and my parents are in the dark that i have stead.. as they are veri strict and dun allow me to have stead at such a young age.. one day unexpectly i was caught by my dad when he was accompanying me back home after my work.. end up.. my parents questioned me and eventually found out my parents and his parents kindda of know each other and both of our parents had approve us t be together.. i never thought they would allow.. the days with him are always sweet and happy.. everything was goping fine.. but since school starts i really dunno wat's wrong with myself.. eventually i felt that feelings with him were lost all of the sudden.. i'm wondering and questioning myself had i realli did love him before.. and i know.. he will be veri hurt if i ask for a break out.. i know.. he was realli feeling low and depress when i ask for a break out.. i didn't want to hurt him.. but if i don't break up with him.. i will seems to turn crazy.. perhaps is like i can't concentrate on studies both on realtionship at the same time.. and there was another reason for the break out.. but the secret will always remain with me forever.. but after it for so long.. i guess your wound have been heal.. i see that you are back to your happy go lucky life, i'm really glad.. but i really sorry that i've made a deep cut in your heart which made u hurt deeply ..     u
