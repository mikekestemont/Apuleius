than accusing a certain group of people and creating conflict they should instead try and forget, understand and aim to improve the relationship between the two groups.
Ellen’s Opinion  My opinion is that I am not on either the Police or the Aboriginal community’s side. I say this because I don’t think there is enough information against either side of the case. From the information I have seen though I believe that both sides of the story are partly at fault.    Most of the aboriginal community have grown up to fear police, I think that this must be partly white policemen’s fault because no community grows to hate another for no reason in particular, as Thomas Hickey’s aunt said “If you’re black and you see a police car you just run”. White policemen may have in the past or still do now abuse or wrongly accuse aboriginals for crimes, which they did not commit. This may or may not be true because there is no substantial evidence to show that this is true other than the words of Thomas Hickey’s family and community and the police case. Thomas Hickey’s family does claim that Thomas was assaulted last December, after being committed for a crime he claims not to have committed.  However Thomas did have a record with an apprehended violence order (AVO) issued against him, he was wanted for assault charges and also small crimes such as shoplifting. Thomas’s dad however claims that “He wasn’t a career thief. He was only stealing for a feed.” I believe though, under no circumstances is there a reason to steal food. I believe this because there are organizations around Sydney, which are willing to help people in need. I think the reason that Thomas Hickey stole for food even though there were organizations is because the most aboriginal community believe that they should be able to look after themselves without white society’s help to show them that they are independent.   The aboriginals have posted demands that they wish for the government, and police to follow. I think these requests are fairly reasonable but many of them will cost taxpayers money and it would require co-operation by the police. I think that the government and police should follow through on some of these demands to prove the innocence of the police that they are claiming and also to settle the matter once and for all. These demands I think are worth taxpayer’s money because if justice is needed than it will be served, it will provide everyone on how the aboriginals are treated and if there may be any other enquires into different cases needed. You need ask yourself why aren’t the police accepting the demands? (See blog called LIST OF DEMANDS……….)  There are two convincing sides to the T.J Hickey debate with both of them with evidence against the other. I have yet to make my own opinion to whose right and which side is wrong but I am sure that the police and T.J Hickey were both responsible to some degree for the a
