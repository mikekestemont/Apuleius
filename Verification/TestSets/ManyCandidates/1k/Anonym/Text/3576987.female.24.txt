need to start inviting people and getting together the party favors, but my time is limited, so maybe this weekend.  I couldn't find my old resume of course, so I need to do a new one by Friday.  I am going to be applying for various jobs hopefully this Friday, and next.  So the little spare time I have the next few days will be focused on this, and exercising.  I lost 1.5 pounds last week, but gained a pound this weekend.  Ate way way too much, going out to eat, late night eating,  and over at  Triple's parents house, oh and the drinking.    So I am back on track this week and will stay on track this weekend.  Friday I will have to work and Saturday we're heading up to see my Dad's side of the family.  Well, I need to leave for work in 5 mins.  So got to go.
Well last week was busy as hell at work, and I had no time to blog.  I have a little time now.  I had a good weekend.  I saw many friends and had fun hanging out with everyone.  Too bad the weekends go so fast though.  I am already ready for the weekend again and it is only Monday.  At least I am not working 12 hours today.  Hopefully this loan will close without a hitch on Friday.  The processor is out of town until Wednesday, this better not screw anything up.  I just want this crap to be over with.  I need to get my resume together this week and then next week I am going to be looking for a new job.  Maybe I will get lucky and find something before I leave.  Well I must get back to some mortgage crap now.
Well I would be in a pissier (is that spelled right?) mood, but I don't have to teach tonight, yeah!  so at least my day will end at a reasonable time.  (however tomorrow will not be so pleasant) It is nice and hot out, so I will be spending sometime outdoors getting some exercise.  Dealing with the loan shit, hopefully everything will go smoothly on this one so it closes next Friday without a hitch, but that never seems to happen, this is probably just wishful thinking.  As for the fuck that owes me $550 in appraisals, he is trying to get out of paying, long story.  This guy doesn't want to fuck with me.  I have signed documents by him stating he will pay these in the advent the loansdon't close, but it looks like we are going to have to send it to collections.  Luckly Jeremy's best friends own a collection agency, and he used to collect when he was younger.    This asshole is really pissing me off.  He makes like $10,000 dollars a month and can't pay his fucking appraisals?  I would like to receive the $$ before I leave for my trip, since my pay was  docked for these fucking appraisals.    Well I have shit to do, so will write more l
