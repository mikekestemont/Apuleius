going back on the 27th and he's gonna finish taking them off!!! So, I'll have them off before I go back to school, bitches! And then I gotta go back in on September 13th and get fitted for a retainer.           4 days, ho!
So, I just talked to my mom. She was like, "They said no to the surgery and the orthodontist is gonna call tomorrow about taking your braces off, so you can stop pouting." So, I'm cool now. Except the car, but I have until January/February.         Might as well have fun `cause your happiness is done and your goose is cooked!         Good song!
Eh.....       I'm majorly depressed right now. For starters, I went to the ortho today and we hadn't heard about the surgery, so I have to have my braces on for another month (until the 27th, at least), BUT when I got home there was a message on the answering maching about the surgery and they said I couldn't get it so my mom called the ortho, but I haven't talked to her all day because I'm pissed, so I don't know what they said. Maybe they said I can go back tomorrow..... *crosses fingers*      AND, the car I want was gone from the lot when we drove by. I guess it doesn't really matter because my dad didn't want me to get a VW Beetle, he wants me to get some stupid Toyota thing because it's a better car. UGH!!!! Old people! They don't care about image at all. Toyotas are for 40-something people, not a 16 year old. My parents have Toyotas. Not me. They're OK cars, though. But the VW is soooooo cuter!      Anywhoooo, went to the travel agent and got my plane tickets and everything and then we went to Olive Garden for lunch and then we went to Target and then Old Navy. Then I came home and did my exericse, but I'm not done with it yet, I'll finish it later tonight.      We also heard about a sweeeeeeeet new mall in Des Moines, and my ma said we may need to ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-check it out! Good news, good news.....
Yo, yo, yo!! What's up bizzzzitches?!?! 6 days until I leave. You know what's up!       Well, I'm working on packing right now. I don't know if everything I want to pack will fit in the suitcase. If the airline looses my luggage I will be pissed. I have good clothes packed (I have to look super glamourous).      Speaking of good clothes, I went shopping again yesterday. Got another pair of shoes from American Eagle and a pair of pants and a shirt I've been wanting forever from there as well. I got pajamas and socks, too. And I got my hair did and a pedicure! Now I got cute little rhinestone flowers on my big toenails!      Tomorrow I gotta go to the ortho and HOPEFULLY he's gonna start taking my braces off.
