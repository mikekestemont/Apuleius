that's right the big J.C. himself.    These two geezers were "upstanding members of the Fayette Southern Baptist church" notice they didn't say "community" because in Fayette County, if you ain't part of the baptist church, you ain't part of the community.  One thing that really makes my point hit home is if you look at the picture.  These two girls had to wear bulletproof vests to their arraignment.  This is because the true members of the SBC aka "community", want to kill them.  Hummmmmm, must be that eye-for-eye thing.  But if someone is truly full of shit, they can justify anything by dis-interpreting The Good Book.  http://www.ajc.com/news/content/metro/fayette/0804/08fayetteteens.html
CNN: "A 74-year-old murderer became the oldest U.S. inmate put to death in decades Thursday after courts and the governor refused to stop his execution."  OK, so Alabama killed a geez.  Not surprising in the least, but what really jerks my chain is that the same Bible-thumpin', conservative, dipshit that pulled the trigger (actually stuck in the needle in this case) is the same Bible-thumpin', conservative, dipshit that voted against a woman's right to abortion.  What's the deal?  Oh, I know, someone has to actually breathe air before it's perfectly sane to kill 'em.  That logic probably works in Alabama, but sadly, it's also the anti-logic of lots of other backward thinking people.  For the record, until men grow a uterus, vagina, some ovaries and other necessary tools, they have NO RIGHT to an opinion on abortion.  'Nuff said.

Well, as I said, I have to continue the practice of becoming the Almighty QFO so I'm taking off and going to my house.  I have to waterproof the foundation so we can finish building out the basement.  As soon as I can figure out how to post photos, I'll add some so everyone can see that I do actually do something.  Since I come to the office around 6 AM and read all the news stuff I can via the Internet, get ready for some real pinko liberal shit to hit the waves.
OK, baby bro suggested I start a blog like the millions of other folks out there, but I'm not sure my psycho-babble is worthy.  On the other hand, I don't get a chance to vent my superbly intellectual liberal jargon much considering I live in the ultra-conservative, flag-waving, right-winged, Bible-thumpin' deep south.  Besides, my employers stupidly decided to try to screw me, so I'm going to return the favour and continue to collect a paycheck while I hone my new skills as the "QFO" (not an acroynm I devised, but I think it's clever).  I'm the official "queen of fucking off" at Georgia Tech.  Shouldn't I get an award or a certificate or something?  Maybe I'll design something once I get more practice.  As this is my first blog, I'll keep it short.  I don't want to sound like a conceited little thing, but I can type faster than I can speak so I will probably have a tendancy to r
