 And I wish I knew you, the way you knew me I'd be alright, right now and I wish I could see you Like you see me, I'd be alright...  (Repeat Chorus)  Just let me be, what you want me to be... Tie me back down, take me whole Don't let me lie to you I've been here too long to trust you So I got to give it back to you Let you in my life Send me all you have for me And I promise you I'll do it right  (Repeat Chorus x 2)   You're always waiting for me...
I have felt so much in so little time No one wants to be the one who has to listen everytime So I'm staying here, waiting for you to speak But all the words you saying are they coming out so clear?  Chorus: No one needs to know the way you feel right now No one needs to bother you for these things But now that they are and now that you've seen Won't you give them back to me?  Don't speak the words you told me a million times It's all I know now and it's not going to make this right But don't worry it's not your fault you didn't mean to change And I wondering if you can see the sky now so clear  (Repeat Chorus)  Bridge: It's so clear in my mind but I can't make it out now It's so clear in my life but I can't make it right this time  Won't you stop and listen and know how I feel Cause it won't do you no good going on to bed Without first knowing that I love you and always will And that you don't have to turn away when this is so clear  Won't you give them back to me...

"  I want to complain about an expensive restaurant. The service was much too overbearing and condescending. I felt like I was buying a used car instead of buying a meal."    <>   "I'm really ticked off at these little lizards that keep drinking out of my rain gauge. How am I ever going to get a true reading?"   (Moron Award of the Day)    "    A woman at the supermarket was careless enough not to put the divider behind my things and hers. Soon I was purchasing her paper plates and shampoo! You would think they would learn!"         Teresa Heinz Kerry:     "Shove It!"         (Sounds like it came from a 4th grader)         John Kerry:       ESPN the Mag: Should there be a college football playoff?    JK: Yes, absolutely.  We don't need the BCS performing like Florida in 2000 .      (He's trying to lose Florida isn't he?)         Ricky Williams, ex-Dolphins RB:        "I'm retiring"   (What he didn't say is that he's retiring from the NFL so he can go to a foreign country and smoke all the pot he wants t
