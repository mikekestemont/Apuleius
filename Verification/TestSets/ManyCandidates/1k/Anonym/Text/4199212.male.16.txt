support to Apple's iPod allowing purchased music from the RealNetwork online store to be played on the iPod. Before, the only purchased music that could be played on the iPod was Apple's iTunes music service. Apple is considering a law suit against RealNetworks.
Today I had to wake up early and walk up to the school because last night I checked on our Web\Unreal Server via RemotelyAnywhere and I went to scan for viruses with AVG and it said that my license was no good. So I uninstalled the pirated version and installed the free version but I had to restart. Well after the restart I could start the web serving application (Analog X Simple WWW Server) but I couldn't start the Unreal Server because RemotelyAnywhere doesn't get along with Direct X applications. Any how I went into the office, started up the server without any problems. I went to Mrs. Cruz's classroom after that to see if everything worked with her computers and she said that her printer didn't print from her second computer in her class. I looked under the printer manager on the host computer and saw that the same printer was installed 2 or 3 different times. So I deleted all of them, reinstalled the printer and set it up on the second computer. Knowing her luck though it will quit working the first day of school. She gave me a ride home and I was bored so I played around with a program called NetCat. NetCat is the network swiss army knife. It is mostly used by hackers because of the ease of uploading and executing it to a web server through a web browser using unicode techniques. Once executing the hacker could telnet to that server. The reason that people like NetCat so much is because you can change the telnet to listen on any port. If you change the listen port to say 80 it will go through any firewall and automatically forward the telnet request from the outside world into the network. It is a really nice tool. After taking a nap I decided to work on my web page a little bit, I added this blog and added a chat room. Both are hosted by a third party company.
Okay this is my second blog that I have had, the other one got shut down after I didn't post in it for a while. Hopefully this one won't get shut down. My name is C.W. Frazier, I am a Junior at Maricopa High School where I am also the assistant network administrator. I love network security but anytime I try to do any hacking at my school I always get caught by my boss\teacher\friend, Chef. My friends (just to name a few) are Lacy, J.T., Chris, Harry and many others. My hobbies are Windows password extracting\cracking, network security as mentioned, testing software, packet sniffing, war driving, music, hanging out with friends, djing at school events and a new way to suck up time, web design and animation. I'm looking forward to this school y
