a good night's sleep for a few weeks now. I have almost forgotten how that feels like. I am paying for a house which I realize now I am not even able to appreciate.  I am asking myself....why the fcuk did I move down?  *cynical laugh   Looks like I'm going to have to reactivate my resume. Wish me luck....I'm going to come home...by hook or by crook. Fcuk the big city. I'm happy being an Amoi Kampung.
The stars are shining on me the last few days. I have finally moved into my own room on Monday and I love it. It's cosy, it's me. Sharing a room with Chloe was beginning to stress me out because I miss my privacy and it feels as if I have lost my identity in the place I now call home. Everything around the apartment does not belong to me and totally does not reflect my personality. However this is going to change! HAhah.      My room has been revamped. I even changed the white drape curtains to this transparent gold weaved Indian textile. Now, when I lie on my bed at night in the dark, I can see the sleepy skyline and lights of Old Klang through my NEW curtains because the windows are glass all the way down to the floor. I finally understand why ppl like to have full glass windows.      I brought my hi-fi down from Penang and I can now play any CD I like all night long. I can't sleep without having the music on. And none of my housemates share the same taste for music as me, so it had been quite a distressing month for me to listen to pop music all the time. I can play my Chemical Brothers, or my Underworld, or my Norah Jones whenever I want.  Bliss .      My next project is to revamp the whole apartment. * snigger       It must have been my lucky day yesterday. Two companies have verbally offered me a job as a Brand Manager.  Wow . I'm flabbergasted.      One a French-Australian construction joint venture. The other a Swedish healthcare company. Sometimes I wonder why anybody would trust   me   to handle their branding. I feel so young at times, but I'm probably in denial of my age...perhaps I have aged subconsiously....you think?  Hmmm ....      Of all the people out there who have more experience than me, who have been in the branding line of work for ages...they picked me. It's so unbelievable. I just can't get over it. I'm just so happy that I am actually worth something in the market...for a position nobody my age would ever imagine possible. I am just so grateful. I really am.      It's 7:15pm. Time to scoot off from the office. I'm going to meet Anne for afterwork drinks at Waikiki.      P/S -   Self prayer: Dear God. Please let the offers be real. Please don't play a trick on me and have the companies change their minds before giving me the offer letter. Please. I will not be able to take it. Thank y
