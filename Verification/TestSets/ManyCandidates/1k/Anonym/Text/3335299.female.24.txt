Bush  urlLink speaks truthfully  for once.
Those who rocked it out on the dirt floored wine-cellars of philly have a moral obligation to dish scoop for FatWhiteGeisha.  FatWhiteGeisha demands his scoop.  My own scoop is infinitely boring.  I pruned the cedar hedge at my mom's yesterday and cleaned the shelves in the garage today.  Tomorrow the bathroom gets a whole lot of lysolid loving.  Good god, what a glorious life.  Saturday FatWhiteGeisha flies.  Scoop please.
Greetings, everyone.  I've been at another wedding in the San Francisco area.  While there, I went to a Kerry fundraiser, ate Ethiopian food, purchased jeans, and so forth.  Anyway, here is the above-referenced list:  1. I saw no Bush-Cheney bumper stickers in San Francisco, not even one.  I thought I saw one, but on closer inspection, it said "Bush-Orwell." I get the point, but Orwell obviously does not even facetiously belong  on  a totalitarian ticket but rather outside of it, providing prescient commentary.  In any case, I also saw no Nader-Camejo bumper stickers in San Francisco, not even one, which is quite different from 2000.  People in SF are big into making their own political posters and hanging them in their windows for passers-by to see.  Despite the number of stylish graphic-arts types in SF, most of these window displays look as though they were word-processed using some sort of manifesto software and/or on an Apple II-C, and printed on an old-school dot-matrix printer where the paper has strips of those little holes at the edges that hook onto the printer and are later torn off.  2. I saw on IowaBlog that there's a rumor that Frank will retire after this coming year and that the university is in discussions with Jonathan Franzen to come in.  Does anyone know whether this is true?  I assume the same source that told Vu this has told one of you.  Please confirm/deny/discuss/masturbate.  3. The sweet corn here in Iowa is fabulous at present.  4. After having few visitors, aside from my parents, since Feb. 2003, we are receiving no fewer than 7 in the next month.  What the hell?  Perhaps everyone wants to see a battleground state up-close, or maybe they've heard tell of the butter cow.  5. While in SF, apparently, I got a stress fracture in my second metatarsal bone (the long bone that extends down your foot from your second toe), and it's killing me.  I can hardly walk, much less engage in aerobic activity or ass-kicking.  I suspect that some combination of poor foot construction (high arches), the high-heeled shoes I wore to the wedding, and my zipping through various airports with a heavy backpack created this situation.  So watch out, those of you who are similarly aged and whose warranties may be running out!  I hope everyone is doing well, particularly those of you who have recently been married or are soon getting married or are establishing a new life as FatWhiteGeisha.com in J
