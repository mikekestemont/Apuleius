car. And for those of you who don't know...he died. That's why I have it.   Anyways. If I have to trade it in. I want a 1998-2002 Chrysler 300M. But Samantha has kinda convinced me to take a step down and get a Chrysler Concorde LXI. Both are possible.   Who Knows...  More to follow...TTFN
Well...Once again, we have revised the entire floor plan of the house. Renovations officially begin in about three weeks.   What is currently the kitchen is going to be demolished, and rebuilt into a recreation room. Plans include a pool table, card table, huge chairs, and monster TV.   What is currently the living room will seamlessly transition into the new Dining room. The new Pellet stove will be installed.   What is currently the Nothing Room will become the new kitchen. This room will have a colour scheme of red and white, chosen, of course, by my colour blind mother.   What is currently Ashley's Bedroom will become the downstairs bathroom. Who else will have two 120 sq. ft. bathrooms. The upstairs bathroom, as well as the bed rooms will be redone next year.   Changes for my room. Well, I will get getting a new door, a new floor, and new walls. Good bye ugly pine paneling :-)  Mind you I had no idea any of this was happening until the credit card bills came in the mail, and my mom was complaining of a huge Visa bill. This, of course, prompted my questioning what a new stove, washer and dryer were for...  I had an idea that we were re-doing the kitchen, but I didn't know it was going to be translated 25 feet along the floor plan. But, they never tell me anything.   Now, I am faced with the dilemma of moving in with Uncle Dean, or staying here.   TTFN
Jew School is over!!  I hated it and its finally over. I will NEVER do that again. I guess next year I can't campaign to get some teachers fired. :-/  IN other news. Yesterday, right before work, we went to the cingular store to get new phones. Well...They were out of my LG 4050, and then said that we weren't eligible for an upgrade until march. I said that I was eligible since April, but I was waiting for my mom. And the guy said that for some reason our contract got restarted...  WELL....WRONG ANSWER, BUDDY. SHE RUINED HIS LIFE LIKE SHE DOES TO TELEMARKETERS.   Then we left all angry, and we decided that we were going to look into other cell phone carriers. Mom suggested verizon, but, to me its the same as Cingular. And sam was having some problems with her bill. :-/  I was thinking Nextel, becuase the walkie talkie thing is fucking amazing. Gary has it, everyone of my family in Eastern Mass has it, and we should too.   Phil suggested T-Mobil...but Well...  Anyways...TTFN
Nothing has really happened worthy of mentioning.   Sam, Phil, and I saw the village. It was crap. I dreamt I started a riot in my imaginary bank in Boston. It was cool.   T
