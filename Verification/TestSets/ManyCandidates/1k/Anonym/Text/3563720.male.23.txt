tonight...and get released...and go to the house...1-800-BAIL-GUY tonight..." I shouldn't joke about such matters. It is bad karma.  Plus, I already know a bail bondsman.
Can a person still be a vegetarian/vegan if he or she swallows certain bodily fluids during oral sex with a male?  My answer:  Yes; otherwise, it would be impossible for a vegetarian/vegan to kiss another individual or to reproduce. Even though human fluids seem as though they are animal products, they are clearly pareve (neutral). Animal products such as fish and eggs are also pareve (making oral sex permissible for vegetarians - since eggs are gametes).  In order to justify the act for vegans, however, a lesser scrutiny standard must be used. Since no killing occurs to produce consumable gametes, they should be treated like plants (a readily replenishable source of cells). Although this same argument can conceivably be used to justify the consumption of eggs and dairy products by vegans, that sort of logic seems flawed. If one consumes eggs and dairy products, he simply prevents the perpetuation of life. This concept should most certainly not bother vegans who are pro-choice and/or use birth control. The destruction of gametes (even potentially viable ones) has already been accounted for as morally acceptable to such individuals and, thus, should be permissible.  However, if the vegan happens to be religiously observant (in any of the major religions), this ruling is null and void. It is highly unlikely that this specific vegan falls under this category since the question establishes her moral standing in the community and deserves privacy protections.  And, no, I did not try to talk a vegan into giving me head, so don't ask.
One fine day  all the thoughts inside my head will turn away from dread I will want to get out of bed  My life would finally blossom if I saw my microcosm as awesome I would no longer be annoyed while lost in my emotional void  My head would be sober and my pain would be over I would stop fooling myself and care more about my health  I would reverse my polarity and would feel truly free  No more away messages sappy with rhymes so childishly crappy
Keep my fingers crossed. Almost through July. Can't jinx them.
My core realization for my period of blog inactivity is that I must continue to be a vocal advocate of personal liberty (as brilliantly articulated by Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, and others).     If these sages' ideas are lost to the sands of time and freedom becomes equated with modern progressivism/collectivism, then society will be damaged in myriad more ways. We owe it to ourselves to protect our individual liberties and retain faith in the inner good of humanity. Were we to reach a point where society were "fixed" through compulsory means, I doubt that most of us would be happy with such an outcome.     The tyranny of a popular majority is not inherently better than the tyranny of dictatorship. In fact, a benevolent dictator would likely be preferable to the deconstruction of the rule of law via d
