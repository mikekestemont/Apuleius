"I still have feelings for you but it's just not working out" that we've all done. I mean being absolutely 100% ~in love~ and still having to walk away. Because there comes a point when you just have to accept reality, accept your fate and start trying to get on with life. Questions like children and god have irrefutable answers - there's no compromise on the absolutes. On some of the in-betweens, maybe  - 2 and 4 could be resolved to 3 children without either person being ~particularly~ upset by the change, because it's still degrees of the same opinion. 0 and Any, though  -  there's no working them together to resemble anything like what they were before. 	I've known, twice before in my life, that no matter what ~I~ wanted so badly, there wasn't any future to be had. And from those two times in my life, I knew that the longer you wait, the worse it gets. 	So I knew that you and I had to say goodbye. It had to happen someday - I felt it had to happen before love grew any further. 	Maybe I was wrong. Maybe you disagree. 	I did what I thought I had to do. For my own heart, for yours though you'd disagree, but yeah, for my own. To be honest, I still stand by it. It's not pleasant, it hurts like hell. 	But I know for a fact that in 4 months, it'd hurt worse. I can't say for sure how much worse, and I can't say for sure if the joy we'd had together wouldn't be worth the increased pain - but you can't say for sure you know the reverse wouldn't be true. Always in life you make a choice relatively blind - you work off your assumptions, conclusions, beliefs, ideas - - but in the end, you just close your eyes and jump.  	I have now, 3 times in my life, had to say goodbye to someone when I wanted to say "I love you, never let me go." 	I miss you, something fierce.
His: Libra: (Sept. 23—Oct. 23) You'll disprove the old chestnut about nice guys finishing last by losing consistently while being a gigantic prick. Hers: Scorpio: (Oct. 24—Nov. 21) It's hard to tell someone who's always been there for you that you're no longer in love with him, but that's why you'll hire a publicist.  "He wasn't a prick, and I didn't hire a publicist. Mainly because even if I wanted to, I couldn't even afford to hire myself, but also because I wasn't in love. Not yet. But all the same, it wasn't--or wouldn't, in the future have been--a good match. And I find myself very very heartsick."     I set this heartbreak aside so long, but always knew I'd have to finish it someday. I find, now, it grew. Fed in the darkness of the rear of my closet, learned my secrets and weaknesses, and watched my smiles to know what I'd miss most.
