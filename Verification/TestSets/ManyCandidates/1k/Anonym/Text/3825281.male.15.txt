like Florida every day. (See two posts below) 80% of the people I saw were Chinese. Someone needs to do something about immigrants, and fast. *coughbushcough*  And I've decided that it should be against the law for someone to sing as good as Kelly Clarkson. It's just not  right . Breakaway is such a good song. That's all that needs to be said, so I'll end it at that.  Oh, and I'm pissed off that Diana is supossed to only sell 50,000 copies of her single. Do people not listen? It's  brillant.  Once again, it proves what this country is coming to. We choose Ruben in season two, and the Fantastic Burrito in season 3.  Terrible . Utterly terrible. First, we have Ruben who can't bust a move without breaking a sweat (haha Veronica!), and Fantasia "Bobo" (where the HECK did that name come from?!..), who sounds like "Donald Duck on Helium". They really should be shipped off to a faraway island with no means of escape. Anyway, I'm rambling.

I am by no means a 'stand-up comedian'. haha Just the thought cracks me up. If anyone besides Veronica is actually reading this, take that quiz and go post your results in the comments section.
So you've found my blog. I won't say much right now (actually, I probably will), except warn you of what's to come. Randomness, meaningless posts, and the side effects of when I get bored. Anyway, now that that's said and done...  I'm got back from Florida the other day. Cool. Not. I've never realized how much I hate this town until I spent three weeks in Orlando, Florida. Nothing but theme parks, sun, and illegal foreigners. That's fine it you want to come to America, but at least learn how to speak the language before you get here and have no idea what people are trying to tell you. Don't get me started.  I saw The Day After Tomorrow last Saturday. Not bad. Pretty entertaining. But a guy walking from Philadelphia to New York City in a storm that's supossed to freeze you solid if you go outside? Right...  I guess I better go.. Maddy and Tyler are here and are just waking up from their nap. Great. That means I get to drag them around outside all day while they scream and give me a h
