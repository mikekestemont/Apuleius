about Jesus or writing from the Bible on it...&nbsp;This picture was taken in Rosarito, Mexico around sunset.  urlLink
urlLink    I posted some pictures of the rose before...down the page more. This one was the clearest one but I never posted it because of the ugly petal....&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    A face only his mother could love&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    And it's gone....&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Ending of the sunset from the Carl's Jr parking lot&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    And yet one more.&nbsp; urlLink

urlLink    This is a picture I took one day while leaving my house to drive around to get good pictures of the sunset, this was my favorite one of about 30 (good) shots I took that night. Those little white dots are cars' headlights on the freeway.  urlLink
urlLink    The sky at another sunset from my house, powerlines in the corner.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Another sunset picture with some different trees.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    The sky at sunset and a tree by my house.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    I'm not gonna try to make this picture classier than it is. I took this in my backyard. It's some black cherry Kool-Aid in a glass that says 'Southern Comfort' on it...just turned to the back. I chose this for this week's challenge "Cool" because it was really hot when I took it outside in the sun and the drink was very cool. Not cold yet though. &nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    My grandma's dog, Lolita, through my cousin's "Diamond" (rather a diamond-looking thing made of glass) she got from the fair.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    I thought my cousin's towl holder looked pretty cool&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    And another&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    View from the freeway on my way home from Oceanside.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    I was at the beach in Carlsbad and I thought the view looked kinda pretty&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Clouds above my head @ the beach&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    My cousin and Lolita on the bach&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Another of the pier with a fisherman&nbsp; urlLink

urlLink    Yoga in the water&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    I chose a more current picture for this week's challenge than I had originally. I took this on tuesday at sunset down in Rosarito Mexico on the little private beach down there. My friend, Brittany,  and I were the only people on the beach because everyone else had left. It was such a beautiful sunset! urlLink
urlLink    My friend Brittany posing for the sunset.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    The ocean from the rocks at the base of the broken pier.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    This is the beach in Rosarito, Mexico by the broken pier with the sun  and clouds reflecting off the wet sand.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    This is a picture I took one night out of the car window when I was on my way back from Charley's (a fast food place...the best around...that serves burgers and fries, that is). I was tring to get the moon and the new freeway...and I guess it worked. It's an okay picture.&nbsp; u
