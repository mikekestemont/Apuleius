ten minutes. i cant let on that im a loser. &nbsp; on the subject of those surveys...i think it would be more productive to have serious questions, therefore actually getting to know who your REAL friends are.  &nbsp; example: &nbsp;&nbsp; " If some crazy Saudi was threatening to end the world but said that he wouldnt if you would kill either A. your mother or B. your first born child&nbsp;&nbsp; who would you shoot in the face to save all of humanity?"   &nbsp;&nbsp;  then after something like that you could soften the mood with a "whats your favoritest color" question.&nbsp;&nbsp; parry and joust &nbsp; i actually used to use the email survey to find out if chicks dug me or not. pretty smart for a 7th grader eh? i would devise this seemingly harmless survey with all the normal questions so that i would lull my victims into a brain atrophy and then spring on the "what do you think of the person that sent this to you" questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; also so i didnt look weird...id forward the first copy to myself so it looked like i didnt create the survey.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wow...so much for not wanting to look like a loser.
I've come to realize that our generation sucks. i wish i lived in the 70s. Dylan, Led Zeppelin, the Gong Show...this is what i need. Spaulding was right...reality tv sucks. my mom takes the tv guide every sunday morning and highlights in pink highlighter all the shows she watches for the entire week. this in itself is kind of weird...but the ONLY shows she watches are reality based. i told her that maybe she watches all of these reality tv shows because she, in fact, is upset with her own reality and finds comfort in watching other people fuck up all the time. she got really pissed at me and stormed out of the room. what does THAT mean. call me Freud bitch
Now i hate that Fandango commercial. I've heard the word TWICE since my last Fandango post which leads me to believe that the word isnt really made up. theres even a movie at Hollywood Video called Fandango...i think its about cowboys or something. oh   and its in that Queen song... "im just a poor boy nobody loves me" that one. it just sucks that something so clever as bag puppets have to plagiarize.     new favorite movie commercial: Fanta. wow     especially Kiki
so im going to Hawaii tomorrow. actually im flying to seattle, staying for a couple days, then heading out to Hawaii. Hawaii is the only thing in this post that deserves to be capitalized...unless i speak of God. anyways...i have this bias on Hawaii already. i think that right when i land everyone everywhere will be bikini clad. what about the guys you ask? what guys i say. hopefully ill learn to surf...and then i can find a secret tiki necklace like they did on the brady bunch. except my tiki necklace will be cooler looking. the one on the brady bunch was really clunky...very obtrusive. like double d b
