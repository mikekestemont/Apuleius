new bandwidth provider.  Unfortunately our old bandwidth provider for those worlds gave us absolutely no notice that they were ceasing trading, and so we've had to arrange an alternative at very short notice.  The worlds are being moved across now, to a different cabinet in the same buildling, and should hopefully be back up shortly (within a couple of hours I hope). I know this isn't the best time of day to be moving servers around, but we were somewhat rushed by the lack of notice. Sorry for the inconveniance.  The CET worlds won't work meanwhile so, please use another world, and I'll post again as soon as they are back. ThanksAndrew
August 2, 2004  Players may be thrilled to witness the addition of new random events today. The events you may come across in your usual routine of playing are as follows:   Maze  You might get teleported into a magical maze by some mysterious old man, but don't worry. Find the centre and you'll be released, along with a reward. The quicker you manage it, the bigger your reward! You will then be put back where you came from.   Strange Box  If you're given a Strange Box by a mysterious old man, open it and answer the easy question to receive a reward. Be warned though; if you spend too long without opening a box, or get a question wrong, they will start replicating in your inventory, so you will have more boxes to solve. You will only get a reward when you have cleared your inventory of boxes. The only way to remove a box from your inventory is to answer the question.   Mime  There's a mystical theatre hidden away which you may get teleported to. (Coincidentally enough, by an old and mysterious man). All you have to do is follow the Mime's performance by repeating his actions and you'll be released back to where you were previously along with a reward.  Note: If any mysterious old men teleport you to the maze or the mime they will do it immediately. If they instead stand there shouting your name, you should respond like normal. Ignoring old men in the hopes they will teleport you to a maze will not work.
August 2, 2004  Zamorak, our much-maligned deity of chaos and destruction, has informed us that he has some answers to players questions in our new edition of  Letters 22 .  We say 'informed', we actually mean 'threatened to suffer a horrible fate involving honey, rope, and a particularly vicious swarm.  Those intrigued to know what secrets might be revealed, and who wish to spare us honest, hard working Jagex folk his wrath, should make their way immediately to the Library of Varrock - please don't hurt us Zamorak!
