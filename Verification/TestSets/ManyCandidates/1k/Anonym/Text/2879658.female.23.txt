reading certain passages. Not a single student is listening or attempting to pay attention at all.  A bit of frustration sets in.  The teacher has me do mundane tasks with absolutely no audience and then tries to discuss how my classes at the boys school are different.  The final straw...a keitai rings, the boy answers it, has a conversation for a few minutes in the classroom during the lesson, and the JTE waits for him to finish his conversation and then continues talking without any type of reprimand.  I was not a happy person and felt that my time was being completely wasted which for an hour and 1/2 it undoubtedly was.    3rd period.  The bell rings and I find the JTE, the second of the day.  This is an English One (I) class. He asks me what we should do, yes the bell for the start of class just rang and we are still in the teachers room, and I asked him what they were learning.  He said he didn't know but would go get the book.  He can't find the teachers manual but off we go to class anyway.  The first 10 minutes are spent listing everything we can't do because of the lack of the teachers manual and the entire class is a bit of a joke.  He keeps asking me what I do in my other English I classes with the two other JTE's and I repeatedly tell him that all 3 classes are learning different things in different ways even though they are all supposedly taking the same course.  Again, I wasn't exactly the happiest of people as if he only would talk to me before class we might actually be able to do something meaningful and productive with the students.       4th period I had a class with the most decent of the three teachers I work with.  We had discussed it that morning and all went as planned.  Definitely a relief as English I classes can be quite boring but this one went smoothly.     5th and 6th is another double period communication class with the same JTE from 3rd period.  Again another two lessons without a discussion or any planning prior to the ringing of the bell.  It is a tedious and boring lesson and by halfway through the second period, the teacher said he was tired and that he doesn't know what else we can do so we ended early.  Yay for small little miracles!!!   Prior to arriving I expected Japanese students to be hardworkers and definitely disciplined, that is definitely not the case at Teizan and being someone who according to contract cannot administer any discipline, having a JTE that also refuses to discipline or maintain any control makes most of my classes, week after week, nothing more than a waste of time for all of those involved.  At least I have 6 classes a week at the Boys School which make me feel that I am actually making a difference in the classroom and that classes here in Japan can be r
