stoked to see the Beastie Boys and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs.  We have lawn seats so we are going to have to get there early and its going to be a long day.  Im looking forward to those $7 beers!  Well better get back to work....
urlLink    Christi and Cory's amazing new futon in living color!
So we just got back from a weekend of motorcycle mania.  It was quite fun I must say.  Not so excited to be back at work though.  My first full week in about a month.  Pretty much sucks even though I'm doing more of the emailing than the working...but whatever...I still have to be here which pretty much blows.  Why can't I have a sweet job that gives me the summer off and pays me for it.  Or shoot...why not the whole year!  What I wouldn't do for that job.  Anyhow, here are some highlights of the weekend: 1. Cory and 8ball on the walkie talkies.  I think their next occupation should be truck drivers.  They've aced the most important part of the job - CB radio kings.  2. Fixing Christi's car hood on the side of the 46 at 2am.  8ball mcguivered it with a license plate screw, strap, and duct tape.  The key to the job was definitely the duct tape.  What a sweet ride that was after its makeover.  The green machine definitely would have made the Top 10 list of Best Hoopdies.  3. Wine tasting.  Enough said on that subject.  I mean really...we all know I'm the wine queen!  4. Riding on a motorcycle with 8ball.  I was pretty much scared shitless and swore that I would never get on one of those death machines.  But 8ball finally wore me down.  I had a great time and am looking forward to riding with him again.  I just need the proper equipment.  My sister has pretty much stated that I will be murdered if I do not get proper footwear.  So I'm going out this weekend and getting some steel-toed boots that will save my little footsies from serious damage.  (And I'm definitely of the mindset that I don't really ever want to have to put them to the test!  So you better be safe with me Mr. 8ball!)  5. Motorcycle races at Laguna Seca (the whole reason for the trip).  8ball brought them up a couple of months ago and stated that he didn't want to miss THE races at Laguna Seca.  I was thinking that 2 days of watching motorcycle races was pretty much going to be the death of me.  But thankfully...they rocked!  I had a great time.  We sat in awesome seats, right on the track, in the Aprilia tent. Those guys ride SOOO fast!  It's pretty cool watching them on the turns and hauling ass down the straight-a-ways.  Very fun.  On the whole, the weekend rocked.  The Laguna Seca Race Weekend will definitely make it into the "annual vacation" register on the ol' calendar.  :-)  On a side note...can everybody say Kern River in one week's time?  WOO H
