don't to seem to have as much of the singy songiness effect as it did in the 1960's. Even in these media saturated imes, loud heavy metal-industrial bands like stalwarts Ministry can't be lound enough to get anyone's attention. But they are not alone. One nail on a nail bed hurts. Hundreds of them gives you quite a nice cushion. The art world is desperately fighting back against the waywardness of a country whose government is conducting it's business in a shadey manner sending a great democratic institution on a rollercoaster ride. So let's listen up, or we'll be dealing with an massive influx of out of work Americans looking to sell a story.  There are several decent documentaries out there that have been making more headway for the genre of documentaries and it's producers, directors, writers, and other affected people that try to get into the gory details of our current state of affairs, making Michael Moore look like a boyscout. There's award-winner  urlLink Morgan Spurlock's "Super Size Me,"  where gluttony and this continent's faith in fast food dining is taken to greater proportions. In terms of making a documetary, Spurlock's approach is just gross. Robert Greenwald's  urlLink "Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism"  takes a crack at dichotomizing the "Fair and Balance" approach to journalism that the network claims to provide to it's viewers, those lacklustre inbreds who tend to think in an unreasonably skewed view of things.  Here in Ottawa, Carleton OPIRG and the Ottawa Public Library, will be host to a special treat. A premier will be taking place Monday, August 23 at the public library on Albert St. featuring a film by American Christine Rose called  urlLink "Liberty Bound: A US Citizen's journey of discovery into the lies, oppression, and corruption that has invaded her country since 9/11."  Possibly a movie that will lend a more of a heavyhanded approach than Michael Moore's own pretty tough foray into the heart of the American Nightmare. Because Moore seems to have had to relax his smarminess to a certain degree in a tactical maneuver. The watering down of his movie, so that right wing loonies can't write him off as a eunuch, shows that were not quite there, yet. Now "Fahrenheit" and "Liberty" are movies of a seemingly parallel wish: to "Get Bush Out."  As Canadians, there isn't really much we can do for the American's but hope that Bush get's voted out, and that Kerry can show that he is any better. We can help them out by showing that we will see their best work in our little Seat of Power town, where opinions should be heard (as anyplace should.) Let them into the country so that they may go back saying, "Well, the Canadians liked my stuff. That should count for something... or , pay for something anyway. Now I can go ahead with the next project and do this touring thing all over again and hit it harder, faster, and smarter on all sides."  Documentaries as punk-rock, eh? What could be better than t
