Saxten and then a girl named Michelle.  Saxten moved out of state and cody and his brothers moved to Denver, Colorado so I never saw any of them again, but at least we all had good times
Truthfully.....Im not a natural born citizen of Florida.  I was actually born in Erie, Pennsylvania where I lived until I was about 10.  I was born into the family of James and Phyllis Young with two sisters and two brothers (Kim, Kerry, Brian, and Jason) and the youngest (Jason) when I was born, was ten.   Growing up, I was a cute little girl with high hopes and dreams that most little kids dream about but they never seem to come true.  I was always outgoing when I was younger; meeting new people and making new friends was what I always did and I was never afraid to do what I wanted to do.  My mom always says that I was such a happy girl when I was younger and that she doesn't know what happened.  She's right....I was happy then; I was practically pissing my pants (not really) everyday because I was so happy....everything just went right.  I guess I get entertainment of picking on other people because that's what my brother, Jason did to me.  When I was around 3, me and my family moved from our house on East Gore Rd. just down two blocks onto Brooksboro Dr. where we customly built our new home.  There, I met my first best friend, Holly Penco.  She lives with her mom, dad, and sister, Heather, who's also a great friend.  They actually lived on that street a few years before we moved in, so our families instantly became great friends.  We met our next door neighbors also who were Pat and Kathy Lasky who had two sons, Matt and Pat.  We never really became great friends with them though.  We also met other neighbors who became my friends.  For example, the Ross's son, Jordan, and my friend Megan Gillespie from pre-school also lived on my street.  As I was saying...it was all good!  I remember when Matt, Patt, Jordan, and their friends used to play hockey in the street and we'd want to play, they never let me or Holly play though.  Also, in the summer, me, Megan, and other friends would roller blade down the street after dinner and I'd always come home with this big arse scrape on my knee.  In the winter, all the neighborhood kids would go over to Holly's house and sled ride in her backyard because she had this mondo hill that her dad would make a path into the woods.  Then we'd fly off of a ramp he made and land into the woods down the trail.....its was the best!  To end the seasons..in the fall me and Holly would rake up leaves and jump in the piles.  Now up north the trees are different...so you'd get these big arse leaves....and Holly had more than two trees.  That's pretty much what I did growing up until I m
