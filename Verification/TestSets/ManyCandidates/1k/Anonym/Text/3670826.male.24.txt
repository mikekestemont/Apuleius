interesting or too silly to become words. In the coming days, you'll see some interesting moments of my life, inseparable bonds, forgettable incidents, crushes and some thoughts. I weigh too much about what others might think of my comments and complaints, read as introvert. This might be one reason why I  ain't,haven't shared my blog spot to my friends, and have concealed my identity.   Looking forward to move further with this not-so-bad start.  -Disciple
http://ohah.net:8000/wombat/uploads/Osho-mono.gif  ">. I ain't a follower of Osho, neither am I a blind beilever of relegion, but an ardent fan and admirer of Osho. My understanding of a religion is as skewed as any other person. Some books which deals with Osho's thoughts ignites a thinking process which makes you question everything you do in life, it makes you ponder for a reason for the purpose of action.

It twinkled a shade more, had the stars had had eyes to capture the sight, it would turn green every time she smiles. ohauh, it was a treasure a person could live with for all his life and re-births. Never have my eyes caught something this beautiful, those were the eyes which define beauty. Infinite never-before-occured emotions erupted and lingered in my heart, soul, body, mind, hmmm and consumed me in totality. And overwhelmed many unexplainable effects on me. May be these unexplainable effects were called by learned as love, the mysterious word termed to define the undefineable desire for a person. That is a state of infinite vulnerability.  Oh my, I felt weak and sensed a sharp pain, all the images dissolved into a black background leaving a big dark void. Eternal is only in words! A sudden chill strolled through my body, I stirred a bit and opened my eyes wide open...A peak of dissappointment with great uneasiness accompanied the day break. Was it all a dream? cursed the sleep, dream, and everything that came along way. It unsettled me, that is not something anybody would want to start a day with. Uncertainity is most certain. The unsettling feeling was put to rest when our eyes met again, pinched myself to ensure that I wasn't disillusioned again. Ofcourse I wa....  -
