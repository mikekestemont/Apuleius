love to put another fish in there just to see what happens...  I'm picturing tanks on every countertop with fish in various stages of demise.  Goldfish hospice.  I don't think we're zoned for that.

Life has been pretty hectic with my two favorite people having monumental birthdays on the same date this year, but the celebrations were worth every second of effort.     During the mayhem, I've tried to keep on top of my work, and I'm proud to announce I've delivered two commissions, been interviewed and photographed by the Chicago Tribune and done a Cartoon of the Week every week except one. (I got busted by friends for re-running an old cartoon that week.)     I do realize that blogging, general accounting and making new architectural caricatures have suffered but I'm catching up quickly. Yesterday I went downtown and took some great pictures for future pieces. The best part of going downtown was that I had a Zek sighting! For those of you not in the know, Pam Zekman is a legendary Chicago watchdog journalist. She's one of my all-time personal heroes. I've even invented a slogan that she doesn't use: "If you're life is a wreck, call the Zek." We watch the pathetically painful Channel Two News every night just hoping to catch one of her always entertaining segments. Whether she's chasing a mob boss down an alley with an outstretched microphone and screaming, "Why aren't you working? The city is paying you right now!" or having a door slammed in her face by the head of a predatory lending firm ("You Channel Two news? You Channel Two News?? Get out of here Channel Two News!!") she's the toughest broad in the Midwest BAR NONE. I love that woman. And I got to see her on the street yesterday. Too cool.     Ade the fish still carries on with her humdrum existence. I've decided she's just a low-tech fish. She refuses the great advances in the fish-keeping industry in favor of a clean water only existence. Whatever. As long as she gets healthy enough to be passed to her rightful owner. At which point I know I'll go down in the basement, see that new Eclipse Hexagon tank lying empty and run out to the fish store for a new occupant, starting this whole ugly cycle anew.     If you don't know what I'm referring to in that last paragraph, the story is in an earlier blog entry. But a now-scarred friend points out that I must warn you: THE LAST BLOG ENTRY REVEALS A MAJOR PLOT DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOPRANOS 2004 SEASON. If you are waiting for the season reruns or DVD release, and don't want to know what evil fate awaits a certain female character, DO NOT READ ON!     Do send your best wishes to Studs Terkel, though. He apparently took a spill over the weekend and is recovering at an undisclosed location. All the best, S
