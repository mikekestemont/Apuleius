I spent my entire childhood in maths lessons, or so I remember. 2. Geography. I'm also rubbish at this subject. It should be combined with Politics and Sociology at school to make it interesting, and they should do away with all that Weathering crap (physical geography should appear during Geology lessons, which should be non-compulsory). Although we should be forced to memorise all the capitals of the world (so that I might one day win Trivial Pursuit). 3. Electronics (as part of CDT, which I'll come onto later). Why couldn't we learn plug-wiring instead of burning our fingers on soldering irons?  The next three subjects are ridiculously useful and kids should be force fed them at every opportunity:  1. CDT. This is ultimately necessary so that TV-makeover disaster shows become redundant. Having studied CDT, I realised that I was good at making Ladybird Clocks but that Ladybird Clocks were my limit, and fitting a bathroom would be foolhardy. And can I just add that people who were excellent at CDT and not scared of the pillar drills were the objects of my envy. 2. Music/Art. Lumped together because they should be part of everything. For instance, if you do a particularly good English essay, you should be forced to illustrate its main tenets with 3D playdoh figurines. Equally, if you're trying to commit a course of events to memory for History, you should be able to sing them in the style of a Dufay motet. 3. Languages. Now I know most people aren't very talented at languages, but how jealous do you feel when you hear two of your compatriots switch between French and English or Welsh and Danish? I think the answer is 'very'. I'm in favour of Latin and French for everyone. If you want to do Spanish or Italian, you can teach yourselves once you're reasonably proficient in the former two.

Of *course* The Big Pit Museum. When I was at school, trips consisted of Big Pit, Cardiff Castle, The Black Country Museum, The Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust at Slimbridge and Newent Peregrine Falcon Trust. Also worth a mention were the Brecon Beacons, the Malverns and all the bleeding farms (I don't remember once going to a concert - why's geography more important than music??).
Note to self: You don't even like Twix bars (biscuits?) so stop bloody eating them!!
Why can't everything be as good as Five Live?  "...and later in the programme, your chance to talk to Denis Law..."
To all you unannounced, clandestine stragglers, it's time to get involved... I like having visitors to my blog but I need you to leave calling cards/comments (I mean, it's as much yours as it is mine). I know I talk in a very forthright manner about contentious topics, but it's not intended to intimidate or undermine anyone else's opinion, it's just a forum for debate. There's no need to be s
