a thunderstorm, and that, also, is most sincerely recommended (apart from lightning risks of course...) Got soaked to the skin and arrived back at Christina's with our clothes apparently glued to our skin!! Hehe twas ver' amusing though!  Queen off now, listening to "Shout!" by the Isley Brothers. ver' good!  Anyway, intended to write something deep, philisophical and totally unconnected to my boring life, but cannae... brain *appears* (:p now you just look stupid!) to have fried, so bye!
Have decided to write about my rather turbulent emotional state, in an attempt to "empty system."       ANGER   FRUSTRATION   CONFUSION   DEPRESSION   TIREDNESS      PEOPLE WHO SAY LOL I KNOW YOU'RE OUT THERE AM SPEAKING TO ONE OF YOU AT THE MOMENT STOP IT GROW A BRAIN GET A VOCABULARY AAAAAAAARGH.      /one rant down, just 1 million 9 hundred and 99 to go...      Right.      Parents... DRIVING ME MAD AUSSI. They are crazy ... or rather, *normal* argh. And very very very annoying and are upsetting me why why would they do that o yes tis their life hobby /draws breath tries 2 calm down fails miserably      Several other things are adding to my frustration and confusion. Many awkward situations, much not knowing where i stand and much interference. Craziness. Tom Mom has signed in joy of joys *that* should help, not. another loller, and a confusing one at that.       Ah now nay is online on AOL buddylist yaay sum1 i like 2 talk 2, real joys. /mood *slightly* alleviated!
Just saw Shrek 2 again, it's so damn good! I love it when they do "Holding Out For A Hero" at the end, I want the soundtrack... although in fact I *do* have the original version by Bonnie Tyler, which I'm listening 2 right now... Not many cds our family doesn't have between us!!  Puss In Boots is so damn cool, I love Antonio Banderas (and his wonderful voice) anyway, and tis a marvellous part! Just a pity he has 2 be an animated cat instead of his usual self *sigh* hehe!! But the cat is *great*!  Wearing my new top, tis ver' nice if a bit over-revealing, methinks for home use only! Got 2 start reading "The Poisonwood Bible"....  Can't seem 2 sleep anymore, tis ver' bizarre.... Ah well, *such is life*. Was up til 5am this morning, tis nicht so gut. /Me yawns!  Ever heard Genesis? No probably not... /damn my varied and unrecognised musical tastes!!  Damn this infernal icecream, etcetera, my diet has flown away on the wind... ah screw it.  Bttr go ... purely because i can't think of anything to say   [first time this has ever occurred in my lifetime]

Fever Stuck All of Maroon 5 Play Me Mr Bojangles Mr Tambourine Man I wish it would rain down, Phil Collins Do you really want to hurt me Karma Chameleon Victims I'll Tumble 4 Ya  And now I must go 2 eat, drink and be merry! (and watch malcolm in the middle...)
