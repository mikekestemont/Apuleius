a lot more subtle.    and on the crap side of the coin, my husband, who quit his job yesterday to take a new job in construction, just found out that the new job in construction isn't the sure bet it initially appeared to be.  not only has the guy hedged on giving him an accurate wage (he told me 10-12 but he wrote down 8-12) but now he's telling paul that he may have overhired and what with the rains and all... well fuck.  where would that leave us?!?!? i know i'm still not working yet.  i was really hoping to hear back from the hospital today but i guess not so tomorrow it's no more bullshit.  no more waiting arround for mannah from heaven. it's time to go full bore on the resumee warpath.  submit submit submit to every place who'll take one.  as many as i can online then bat clean up by doing cold calls in the am and seeing what I can't see from there.    the sad reality of our situation is we have exhausted not only our reserves but those of our familes as well.  our government is no help whatsoever.  apparently since i just went to school they're not worried and despite the fact that paul is only bringing in somewhere in the 950$/mo range (well below the poverty line) we're apparently too rich for social assistance.  i can't collect EI because i haven't made 700 hours since my last claim and paul may or may not be able to but even if he can that's only 55% of the 950 he was making before and will not take effect for two weeks or possibly even three.  what a fuckaroo...
well colour me enlightened.  looking at the pictures that other people have collected in shoeboxes and what have you, i notice that I'm not there.  I never was there and I don't know these people.  Who are they?  They look like my family but they can't be.  They don't know me and I don't know them.  Do I want to know them?  Sometimes but not always.  Sometimes I want them to know me.  But mostly I just want everyone to go away and let me live in my little brown box under a tree.    I am so full of shit.  I don't want that at all but (3 guesses keeds...) I'm scared.  What if they did know me and didn't like me?  What if they liked me and I did something retarded to fuck it up?  What if what if what if?  And SO WHAT if??? What could I possibly have to lose?   Yeah, well that's easy for you to say but you're not me.   Or am I?   Ever get the feeling like you're living in a Stephen King book and all of a sudden you're Johnny Depp burning down your own house?   Me too.  Allllllll the time.   Well not always Johnny Depp but always not me.  Someone else who lives in my skin and doesn't know their way arround so well.  It's not pretty, i
