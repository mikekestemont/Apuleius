the most important election I have ever taken part of.
urlLink Vice President Cheney told the MSNBC  a couple weeks ago that the Bush administration never claimed that Saddam had anything to do with 9-11.  He said that they had a relationship.  Well here is a  urlLink letter to congressional leaders from George Walker Bush March 18, 2003.  The letter is worded very carefully but it clearly implies a link between Saddam and the attacks on 9-11.  It was clear to me at the time that the link between Iraq and al Queda in regards to 9-11 were one of the main reasons that we attacked Iraq.  The Bush administration wants us to now believe that it was the relationship itself that was the problem.  Bush and Cheney still claim there was a relationship but provide no facts to back it up.  Bush and Cheney remind me of that Martin Short skit on Saturday Night Live where he plays the liar on Sixty Minutes.  "I didn't say that you did.  The media keeps distorting what we said".  I just wish Bush and Cheney's lies didn't cost so many lives.
I read the  urlLink speech  Bush gave to the Air Force academy last weekend and it really blew my mind.  In it he says our war on terror is unique and in many ways similar to our wars of the past.  He sites WWII as one war that has similarities to the present conflicts. It is unique in the fact that we attacked a country that did not declare war on us as Hitler did.  It is also different because, unlike Japan, Iraq did not attack us first.  The war on terror in Iraq is unique in the fact that the Bush administration went in with a fraction of the troops needed to turn that country around in a timely manner.  Bush sites the similarities between the Pearl Harbor and 911 attacks in provoking us into war.  Afghanistan aside, if Bush was president during WWII would he have attacked Peru?  I think our president should quit the analogies.  This is a purely unique war in Iraq.  Not only did they go to war on shaky intelligence but Bush has changed the reasons why we are there many times.   urlLink He claimed he didn't endorse nation building  but now he talks about how we are  urlLink going to liberate Iraq with democracy .  Talk about flip flopping.   Reasons for going to war aside, we went to war in Iraq in the worst possible of ways.  urlLink General Zinni, in a Sixty Minutes interview , said that it was the wrong time to go and the wrong way to do it.  We went in with half the troops we should have used.  Sure, they were enough to overthrow the regime but not enough to secure the country.  I wonder if there would have been fewer casualties if we had gone with a bigger force.  Let's not forget that no one(Rumsfeld)has been held accountable for this.  All there is from this administration are pats on the b
