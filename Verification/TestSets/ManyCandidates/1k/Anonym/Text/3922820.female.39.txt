be back to normal about a week after treatment. I have had mild issues with fatigue, leg pain, dry eyes, dry skin, brittle nails, and lip sores. My hair has also become very brittle and I imagine it won’t be long before it starts to fall out. But even with all those mild nuisances, I can function normally, work, visit with family and friends, and lead a pretty normal life. I really can’t complain. I’m not trying to tempt fate here. I realize the chances are pretty high that the side effects will increase with each treatment. I just take it  urlLink one day at a time .
As the week progresses I find my laughter louder, my smile broader, and my fatigue lessened. I do feel good and love that I have my normal life right now. The medical industry has made such strides with chemotherapy and cancer treatment and I am so very thankful. I remember a time when if a person was diagnosed with cancer, he or she would disappear for awhile during treatment and likely you wouldn't see him again.

What I have learned is that with  urlLink early detection  cancer is like a toothless lion. It looks scary as hell, but it won't devour me.
I know I only took one day off from work for the chemo; however, four days of “nothing” are difficult for me.  You know I have watched too much television when I begin to wonder if the game show “Lingo” is still in development and recruiting contestants or if these are just reruns on the Game Show Network.  Today, after a brief visit from the home health nurse, I came to work with joy and excitement.  How often does anyone say that on a Monday?  I am delighted to work today.  I am delighted to be alive today.  I am delighted that this first round of chemo was not so hard on me.  All those times I searched for the excitement outside of the routine and was frustrated with boredom, I missed the key point.  I was breathing the air, feeling the sun on my face, and had choices of how I could spend my energy.  Abraham Lincoln was right when he said, "Most people are about as happy as they make up their minds to be."  I am happy today.  I am most grateful for this day.   What are you grateful for t
