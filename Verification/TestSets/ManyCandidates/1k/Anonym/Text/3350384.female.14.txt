myself today i was wiping off danae's face witha paper towel and this nasty ass girl made a comment about it being cute. so i said "just wait until i start licking it off..." she gave me funny looks for the rest of the day i'd rather she didnt look at me at all creepy kid stares at me and danae a lot. god that kid is annoying every other word he says is 'fuck' and i just wanna yell at him to shut the fuck up and stop talking like a fucking moron. lol. i think the nasty kid finally washed his hair...still wearing the same clothes though ryan is here hes gonna have to go to church with us hahaha poor guy so long ass swim meet today. 5 hours. 3-8. i didnt show up until 4 though, but they were just starting anyways. i swam the first 2 events and the last 2, and had to sit around doing nothing for about 3 hours in between. loads of fun. especially with my many friends...so naturally, i took a nap i think i need to be less anti-social people tend to annoy me though and i suck at approaching people especially when i'm half naked wearing a swim cap very attractive, of course and there are like no hot guys at this art thing. unless you want to count one of the teachers... mmm still wondering whats up with the chiquita obsession...
god i suck at ceramics and a couple of these teachers are most definitely fags no doubt for the red headed one with glasses nothing against them though except maybe my sculpture teacher god that man is annoying "and what does that represent to you?" i thought it looked pretty, fuck off.
my grandma had gas tonight. oh my god. i wanted to die. we were sitting at dinner, and every couple of minutes she would let one rip. and they werent discreet, quiet farts either. full blown. and of course, no one wanted to say anything, because its grandma. and like whenever she farted, ahe wouldn't even acknowledge it, she just kept on doing what she was doing. i wanted to laugh sooo bad. especially after my grandma farted, and my dad looked at my little sister mckayla, thinking that it was her. lol but oh my god, it was so bad.  theresa called me last night at like 9:45, but we're not allowed to take calls after 8. so i didnt get to talk to her, and she wasnt home when i called her back today. so i dont know if shes going to call me tonight or not, but its already 7:30. it makes me happy that she called me though.  sarah moved out the other day, i dont know if i said anything about that already. im gonna have my own room! whoohoo!  im burnt. not too bad though.  i would be watching tv right now, but my grandma is over there. lol.
my grandma has hairy legs.
i feel like a bum, but i love i
