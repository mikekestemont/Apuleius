a bit more known and a bit more noticeable we become,... Shall we say if not particularly well semantically linked.....iterated a bit more and each sub -iteration and transactional iteration makes us more Knowable if only because of our ever burgeoning ubiquity. I pop up on Google in places I don't remember being before and I am listed in a "people with interests in:......along with about 15 other people with pictures that are interested in the same thing. My picture is missing... How did that happen? Hell, how did I even get on this, quite complementary, little listette? I am getting more popular without people have had to have read my writings or even link to my pages simply because what I have linked to my page has been linked back to me as me....Actually I like it. The Dumb IRS thinks I owe them 63,000 dollars in taxes for 2003 and I never made that much money that year... That's like 200% taxation rate. They theorize I did it all in sneaky stock trades....on which I actually lost money. But after losing the money I have lost and analyzing the trends I followed and the stocks I selected. I found out how to make money. Failure was a friend this time. I mean,.. I discovered that had I left alone almost any ( 9 our of 10 ) stocks I chose at any time in any combination and simply left them there, randomly chosen (which it appears I was a fantastic picker!!) I would have made about 500% gains!!

Definitely someone I should have listened to few years back. But enough of that,,,,,,, He has helped me place this little video of myself in here, and we are helping one another on a site concerning his mother. She was a mother of 6, he one of them,. One of fraternal twins. The site he is making has portions with each his own section about their memories about Mom, Barbara,.... Who died on Dec. 5th 1997. My role in all of this... Well you will find out if you follow the blog over time. My story, and so will their's, be told over time. And some day, if we keep adding material and going through it all; And there is a lot; Letters, Cards, Video tapes ( must be 40 video tapes in total including the ones I am no longer hoarding to myself).... We intend to make, with a page he has already started in memory of his mother, a bigger more enhanced page with a place for every family member to add their thoughts. It is a long and, and very odd story about the the intersection of our lives. But it happened, and almost none of us regret any of it. I know I don't and neither does K
