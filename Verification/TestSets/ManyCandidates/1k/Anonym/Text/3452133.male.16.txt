at the pool during the farmstay. Then we on the plane also got play alot... although its hazy. I remember talking to Jasmine and Juri about Cynthia... and they were like: "cYnNnThIaAaA~~". Haiz how i miss last time...  Time flew again.. a couple of months. I went back to band practise with Ju and Jas, and she came and asked for my number. Then we started sms-ing each other from there.  Then suddenly Suzhen come and sms mi. She essentially enabled the "iseedeadpeople" cheat onto me. But it was for the better good, because on the same day I asked for Cynthia to be my stead (which was... 2 weeks after Suzhen first sms), some guy asked Cynthia earlier in the day.  Thank God she chose me.  (P.S. I typed out every single detail what happened that caused us to be so close, but i decided it was too personal... everyone needs his/her secrets!) Well, here i am now, with this beautiful pretty girl as my girlfriend. She may only be 14, but I don't care about age and what people think anymore. I really love her, because of who she is. I wanna grow with her, I wanna be her knight in shining armour.  I have now resolved to be a better man. And with Cynthia as my beacon, along with all whom i respect (who are all my family and friends) and for the sake of finding out my true worth in life.  wahaha all of you who read this blog think i take life too seriously rite? dunt wori lah, i just typing all of this down so that i can prove to myself that i DID write this things down(  i feel i got a memory prob ).  Song Plug of the day that you won't even bother to download : Blink182 - Shut Up. (fuck, download EVERY blink song. You won't regret any of them.)  Went with Monkey to cut hair at Bapok. Haiz... made mi miss last time... I suggested we go eat ban mien for old time's sake. And we did. He took the guitar back too...  Kino signs off here.
Damn comp. I cant even open my webpage properly. But i've been looking thru the HTML and there's nothing wrong. I guess its just my computer. This lousy computer is as antiquated as a Soviet-era Russian oil rig (where the hell did i think of that?) and its holding up until now only because i frequently run maintenaince stuff. The only saving grace of this comp is the sound system (i feel its even better den Brandon's). Of course i not so kua zhang as Mama go and make surround sound lah, but this speakers sound goooood-ah.  Monkey is online. His nick is "tWinS cuMinG on 12 aUg 04... steady pals pls feel free 2 contact mi We can go there 2gether !!steady ma!! go la!! or else i psyco".wahahaha  I got crazy stomach probz... damnit.  2ml going crystal jade...  remind self to do hw and studi.
