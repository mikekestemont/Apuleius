i'll tell you a more detailed version some time, but for now i've got another thing on my mind as well, namely the fact that the upper bit of my left arm hurts for no reason at all, can't even break chocolate with my left arm cause it hurts :( oh wells, i'll just go to the doc and find out what it is, seen as its been like this for a few weeks :(  Anyways enough of me moaning!
Sweetie! Welcome back! I'm sorry to hear about this trust issue thing you got going on.. I hope it all works out okay for you. But remember, just because someone does something bad once, it doesn't mean that you can't ever trust them again - I don't know the whole story but they may have just made a mistake...  Think long and hard about where you want your friendship to go with these people before you do anything silly. :P  *hands you a bucket of love* wuv yoo
Well, don't really know where to start, so much has happened, some good, some bad, some things that piss me off alot ('cuse my language) and some things well that i just can't be bothered with.  Today i went to Manchester with phil, alice & danny. We met clare and heather there when we got there. Well it was interesting. I didn't really say that much, mainly because i've been doing a lot of thinking at the minute and would just rather not share some of my thoughts with people.   Theres a few people i don't trust, and i've got good reason not to trust them, and i don't think i'll ever trust them again.....its just the way i am, if someone i think i can trust, turns out to be someone i can't trust, then i just don't think i'd ever be able to trust them again. However there are a few select people that i trust a lot, people who've been there for me when i've needed them.  [will update later on when not so pissed off]

So, we'll go no more a-roving   &nbsp;      So late into the night,   &nbsp;    Though the heart be still as loving,   &nbsp;    And the moon be still as bright.    &nbsp;    For the sword outwears its sheath,   And the soul wears out the breast,   And the heart must pause to breathe,   &nbsp;A  nd love itself have rest.    &nbsp;    &nbsp;Though the night was made for loving,    &nbsp;   And the day returns too soon,    &nbsp;  Y et we'll go no more a-roving    &nbsp;   By the light of the m
