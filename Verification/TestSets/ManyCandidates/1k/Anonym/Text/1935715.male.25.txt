we might contemplate our shame -- Stuart Jeffries - The Guardian
And so to continue the story, at least for a little anyway.  We had a bit of a laugh watching the rugger because there were all these adds for Tooheys and Bundy Rum which had the common theme of Australian males (often Wallabies supporters) requiring either females or teddy bear's to help them out and to stand up for them. Needless to say these comments didn't really go down too well with the aussie males around us, but no bear came to rescue them.  Sunday, Kirsty from NZ & her brother who were over in Sydeny for a couple of weeks, came along to church, it was nice to have visitors. And her bro is possibly going to be over here studying. That would be good as he's a really nice dude. We ended up being very late to church though, and then I missed the evening service cause I was too slow. Not too excited about that. But cell was on on Tuesday, pretty low key. Ended up playing pool at the Clock in Surry Hills.  Much else news worthy, nope not really. I didn't get to the gym last night like I wanted to, but I did get some photos up on Flickr ( urlLink http://www.flickr.com/photos/roladex/ ), so I have some more images on the web. Wowsers. Check them out, ya'll.  I'm off to the gym, take two. Work is over for the day.   “Fashion is architecture: it is a matter of proportions” – Coco Chanel
What anice day to be blogging again, hey.  Havn't done much in the way of updating for a while, I've pretty much been flat out at work, but the team presentation is done, the work at home Bank hoiliday is complete and another weekend has passed.  Chris & I went to look at places at Kirribilli on Saturday. We really are pretty hopeless at looking for a new place. We got up at about 10am, got the paper &amp; headed over there. Turns out there was only the one place open for inspection in the paper, and we had missed that. So we headed into the agency there and they advised us that they had one open at 12:15. We went to the wrong place, then we missed the agent, and had to call her back. The place was a hole as well, and they wanted $420 for it! I for one was shocked. It really was nothing at all. Then we met up with Dave & Nicola for a brief chat. Then had some of the worst fish &amp; Chips ever in the park under the bridge. Wont be eating there again, methinks. But I still really like Kirribilli I must say.  Sat evening was spent up at the pub watching the Wallabies beat the Springboks. But more on this tommorrow, I'm off to the gym.   “The proverb warns that, ‘you should not bite the hand that feeds you.’ But maybe you should, if it prevents you from feeding yourself.” –- Thomas S
