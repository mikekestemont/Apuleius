everytime i try to get up from that far on te floor!!!!!)we went and picked up the lawnmower..then we priced pools..but we can't put one in till Eric sprays the fence so i guess this weekend we may get one..today i think it's a library day..they have to read over summer..since i think its good to keep the brains working..and maybe we will swing by a.c. moore or michael's and find a crafty something we can do together..if you have any ideas...feel free!!!
well..the kids are here and so far we're having a blast..of course..we played in the sprinkler for a while..no pool till the weekend..and we just went over to Shep's to pick up their juggling sticks..learn more about them  urlLink here  what i've gotten the kids are called..."devil sticks"..and became popular here in the '70's..they are great for teaching focus and dexterity..a wonderfully relaxing pass time for anyone..any information you may want is at the link including how to's and a lil history..well...lunch time is over and summer camp is on again maybe tommorrow we will go to Jordan Lake..it's near Pittsboro and although it isnt fancy..its only 5 bucks a car load and fairly close to home!!!!!..hey moms got any ideas for me?..maybe we can exchange some ..i want my kids to have a fun and educational summer
well...what a busy few days...we have gardened and grilled and hung out at Lake Jordan...we've played video games and croquet...we went to a sushi restaraunt and sat on the floor..the kids are great with chopsticks....i finally finished admission procedures for college...all that's left is to figure out where my high school records are..they are still missing...ugh...and the biggest news for me ----due to the missing records i may have to take a ged..ugh..this is awful...
There's something i'd like to share with you all....as long as i can remember i've told everyone the answer to every question is "chicken"..today i gave that nugget to my youngest son....BIG mistake    anyone with kids and even some without , know that kids can take anything and run with it..now everytime i ask him a question..he answers .."chicken"..funny as hell...
urlLink    the boys in NYC&nbsp; urlLink    Aren't they gorgeous?!
well it's been ages but we've been busy we took the kids to NYC had a blast..did lady liberty and the empir state building times square...and a double decker bus....speaking of which grey line tours is a rip off...just get a metro pass its cheaper and more reliable drew started a sketch book and josh did a lot of juggling...we've done a lot of stuff around the house and a few times to the lake..nothing really exciting..but really relaxing PS..Shrek 2 is NOT as good as the first one...the characters were flimsy and the story line was way too drawn out  the kids thought the giant gingerbread was funny..but overall they really weren't that impressed (translates into...didn't even MENTION it the next day)hope everyones summer is going well take care..oh by the way this is a pic of the kids on vacation
