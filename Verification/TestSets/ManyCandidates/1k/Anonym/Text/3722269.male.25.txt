Chicken on Rice, Hokey Pokey Icecream for desert.  Drinking:  Coffee, lots of it.  I had a dream last night, and like most dreams that we remember (which are only the ones we wake up, or stir from our sleep during) it didn't make a fuckload of sense.  It started with me and some (presumably) friends, sitting on some grass with back packs.. maybe school-esque, having lunch or morning break, but it turns out where on someones verge / front lawn.. but the section we're on is one of those ones you can only get to the back yard of, if you go through the house, now me and the people I'm with, sneak through this old ladies house, to get to her back yard, where the two kids boy twins from 'everybody loves raymond' are playing in a cubby house, and I'm all of a sudden walking on top of the fences that separate all the properties in the vacinity.. much to the dismay of the people around me. Weird. About then, my friend charlotte wakes me up with a coffee. I love dreams, they intrigue me. I think the random items in any given dream, can be sorted out.. but I think the dream is the association and cross-linking between seemingly random items in our mind.. I think when we dream, our mind is building this 'database' if you will, of what we remember, and how it relates to other things we remember. That's my theory. Choice.  What a cool weekend, it's always nice to have someone visit, and after being so rudely let down on the thursday night, by one person, it was nice to have someone come through with what they said they'd do. Charlotte loved her birthday cake, which ended up a 3 layer chocolate cake with blackberry jam and cream between each layer, frosted with chocolate frosting, and a crumpled flake over top, with 21 candles.. her 21st having past a week or two ago. Spent the weekend doing some of the 'us' things in rotorua, like indulging in our favourite onion rings (yes they're good enough to talk about) and making videos of racing around the city in the minis. Charlotte didnt expect the cake, at all, which was nice, nor did she expect the presents, which was also cool - suprises are great, especially when you get to see a persons face light up. What I didnt expect, was how much I enjoyed the visit.  Need For Speed Underground has pointed out to me just why some people buy steering-wheel setups for their pc's. It's very very sexy.. and plays so nicely. Makes the X-Box version look like a crudely carved piece of bison-board. I should get paid tomorrow, for the computer I fixed 3-4 days ago, this is a good thing, as I'm stoney broke. Ahh well... the cupboards are full, and I'm content :D  I must restart my strict eating plan, the sock-knows-best diet, and the jogging/walking.. Plus, now I've got a business plan to put together.
