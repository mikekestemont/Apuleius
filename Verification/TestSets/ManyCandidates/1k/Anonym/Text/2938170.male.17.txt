Food. People are trained on cold food before they can train on hot food. At the end of august starting with this friday, every single member of the 6-pack will be leaving. Kevin is moving to Ottawa, Kim has a job in Toronto at a lawfirm, Jenn has a job in Toronto at special fx makeup place, Sharpie is gettin another job, Michelle is goin to college and I of course am goin to university. Well I was a fast learner and the only one too learn hot food in one month flat,  out of the new 5 let's see Alan kind of knows how. Out of the 6 leaving we all knew both sections, and when we leave unless they can teach Alan to work 7 nights a week they are screwed.  speaking of work, I hate annoying customers. This one woman comes up, asks for like a shitload of chicken wings, I tell her it'll cost alot but she persists so I price em and give em to her. she comes back and says she doesnt have enough money but she'll come back. an hour passes, then 2 hours so I put em with the rest of the wings and they eventually get sold. she comes back and I tell her they're gone and she starts flipping out. Then she decides to get the bakery manager who tells her its not my fault and then she thinks we are all against her and runs out in a rampage.   met some university people in the same program as me on the message boards. got my meal plan and all that ready and I cant wait for move in day (september 5th). frosh week is gonna be so sick, at work michelle is like wong-fung at university you're gonna be such a pimp and i'm like 'yahhhh, i know' smilin like hardcore. i helped sarah close bakery tonight and when i was tellin her about my 'outings' last week with leanne and kimmy #7, she agreed 'wong-fung you'll be a major pimp at university' so i just smiled.  got a new everything, mini-fridge, boom box, lol and a bunch of lil stuff like an electric tootbrush, gel bottles, tissue boxes, binders and all that. this month better go by fast, but at the same time I want to meet a girl and have a meaningful relationship with a mutual breakup in the period of 3 weeks, that'd be so sweet.  august 14th is the birthday, but it'd be cool if me and leanne just chilled in the day because at night I'm goin to this surpise party for my friend x who may be reading this. it isnt even a birthday surprise party its for something they did or will do thats so worth it. my bro is goin out that day anyway and i think my rents are working so we cant do a family thing.  oh, and jess, if ur reading this, i finally did a real post ( boo-yah in yo face, but u still hot ;) )
