Around the corner I have  a friend,  In this great city  that has no end,  Yet the days go by  and weeks rush on,  And before I know  it, a year is gone.  And I never see my  old friends face,  For life is a swift  and terrible race,  He knows I like him  just as well,  As in the days when  I rang his bell.  And he rang mine if,  we were younger then,  And now we are busy,  tired men.  Tired of playing a  foolish game,  Tired of trying to  make a name.  &quot;Tomorrow&quot; I say! &quot;I  will call on Jim  Just to show that  I'm thinking of him.  But tomorrow comes  and tomorrow goes,  And distance between  us grows and grows.  Around the corner!  yet miles away,  Here's a telegram,  Jim died today.&  And that's what we  get and deserve in the  end.  Around the corner, a  vanished friend.  Remember to always say what you mean.  If you love or like  someone, tell them.  Don't be afraid to express yourself. Reach out and  tell someone what they mean to you. Because  when  you decide that it  is the right time it might be too late.  Seize the day. Never have regrets. And most  importantly, stay  close to your friends and family, for they have  helped make you  the person that you are today.
Love means...  a girl and guy were speeding over 100 mph on the  road...  Girl: Slow down. Im scared.  Guy: No this is fun.  Girl: No its not. Please, its too scary!  Guy: Then tell me u Love me.  Girl:Ok, I Love u. Slow down!  Guy: Now give me a BIG hug.  *Girl hugs him*  Guy: Can u take my helmet off & put it on? Its  buggin me.   In the paper the next day: A motorcycle had  crashed into a building because of break  failure.   2 ppl were on it but only 1 survived. The truth  was that halfway down the road, the guy realized  that his brakes broke, but he didn't want 2 let  the girl know. Instead, he had her say she Loved  him & felt her hug 1 last time, then had her  wear  his helmet so that she would live even though it  meant that he would die. Now if there is anyone on here that you love and  care for that much, say to him or her I love you and be sincere about it...
