 Today I found a worthy competitor to Scharffen Berger for "best chocolate" in the U.S.,  urlLink Dagoba  Organic Chocolate.  At the  urlLink Portland Farmers Market , there was a booth selling bars of Dagoba.  Founded on  urlLink Yoda's  home world, er, by a chocolate obsessed musician in Boulder, Dagoba has grown and moved to Central Point, Oregon.  They had two stand-out  urlLink bars , both dark of course.  The first is a 59% lavender and blueberry infused bar, the other a 74% bar called New Moon.  I've made  urlLink lavender shortbread  before, and this lavender chocolate is great - floral and earthy with a hint of blueberry flavor and occasional bits of blueberry.  Dagoba's claim to fame, is the "alchemy of  urlLink flavor infusion , an art they explor with "mystery and integrity."  Their lavender bar lives up to that billing. Dagoba also has their own unique  urlLink blend  of cocoa beans - also top quality.     Like many highly sought after things from Latin America, Dagoba comes in 2 pound bricks.  No nibs though.  You can buy Dagoba organic chocolates  urlLink here .  [Hat tip:  urlLink Beast Blog ]

urlLink    Dog blog Friday - Dakota after a bath, nice and shiney.
She's smart, articulate, and urbane.   Her blog is titled  urlLink Postmodern Courtesan , and in it she describes her observations on life from the perspective of a high class prostitute - to hear her describe it, it's not that unusual a life.   Her blog is erotic with a paradoxical blend of  urlLink intimacy and anonymity .  Her writing is straightforward and matter of fact; she sounds self confident and authentic, comfortable with her life and herself (no inferiority complex here).   She describes what its  urlLink like , how she provides  urlLink "cover"  for her professional life, her personal life -- from the  urlLink folks , to past  urlLink lovers . If you have questions, she will  urlLink answer .  Her blog handle is Olympia, and she provides a fascinating glimpse into her life.  I don’t feel voyeuristic reading her – she comes across more like a platonic friend telling you about her semi-secret life.  I just wish I had an image (a hand, knee or shoulder) to go with this post.
In what was a watershed event for me, this blog was bestowed some serious cred in  urlLink The Bronxxx Diaries .  I am now officially a "mothafucka", a considerable step up from my most recent designation, "asshole".   urlLink NAM:LIVE  and  urlLink Scream and Scream Again  are two great and very worthy examples of "non-commercial" creativity to be found on the web -- if you know where to look.  I was lucky to stumble across them both.  Sharing things I stumble across is why I do this -- and I'd love to hear from any visitors who have suggestions for music, literature, art and other pop culture.  Thanks to both Merlin and Chloe.
