at paint-balling this time as you had at the Dragon's Lair in Brentwood?
yes, it's going to hurt in many, many ways. but you only live once, eh? and at least i get to choose the manner of my passing.  or is that my pissing?
Dave, apparently you are an Edinburgh virgin and your going for the first time with Billy!  I must warn you when me and Patrick went up there for a few days we got pissed on the plane on the way up and didn't return to sobriety until at least twelve hours after we'd crossed south of the border.  This was mainly due to Bartram showing off his enhanced student lifestyle where if he wasn't at the radio station he was either in an establishment that specialised in the sale of alcohol or at home where his fridge contents consisted solely of Stella, Vodka and Cranberry Juice!  Plus you are going for some Whiskey tasting do!
what aboot far cry? and when am i getting my half life 2?
I've played it for about 7 hours now in an optimum environment of small dark room encrusted with speakers on my own and the more I play it the more boring it gets. There is literaly no variety - all the rooms look the same the monsters are dull and very very stupid. The weapons are crap and its not scary. Its pretty but not ridiculously so and it really is a big tech demo to make people licence the engine. As such it should be free and you shouldn't buy it. Just download the fucker and get bored with it and imagine what companies will do with the engine.  So there.
doom cops: the taste of mars justice.
No-one should buy doom cops its rubbish.
Damo, where are you getting Doom from? Play still say they're getting it on Friday.
Yeah, it's not the sort of game you play with other people around though to properly experience...it probably takes a reasonable amount of time to get into as well.  Either way it's got to be better than Soldner which sucked complete monkey balls.
No-one can come close to my 4 million in one week Keanu-a-thon. No-one. Ever.
i believe that i have made my daq-tactics clear in the past. i am still living in hope of a hostile knightley-takeover.
Did anyone notice Matt getting 2 million squid in the 'Daq in one week this week?  I think he wasn't far off three million too.  I reign supreme in the League Of Kings.
i played some doom 3 over the weekend at dave's. i was hella-disappointed.
I just had an email saying my copy of Doom3 is arriving tomorrow...cool.   Doubt I'll be able to play it though as turning on my computer for any length of time results in the room temperature breaking 40 degrees...heat and rotting flesh don't mix too well.
I think I may be allergic to mine....every now and again they hurt.
You get up and go to work on a Monday morning,  you're gonna have a bad time , ok?
do you concur? i do.
Fuck it up its stupid a
