amazing movie. Pretty funny: Road trip (2000), and amazingly awesome: Old School (2003). Eurotrip was an arse load of bad jokes, terrible physical humor, and a whole lot of breasts. It was like watching horrible soft core pornography. Garbage.   Anyways, I'm not here to be a movie critic. If you liked these movies then I don't really care. One thing you can do while watching bad movies (sometimes you can do this during good movies to) is pay close attention to the movie extras. The utter lack of acting talent in the extras is where the real entertainment is in most bad movies. I am not saying that all movie extras are terrible. I actually believe that the majority are very good at doing their job. There is the occasional horrible one that makes a funny face when he/she really shouldn't be making one, or walks or looks really weird. For most movies these days, paying close attention to the extras is the only way to justify your five or ten dollar entry fee at the theatres or whatever your local video store charges.   Here are some movies that you should avoid if you don't like having excrement rubbed hard into your open eyeballs. First on my Movies to Avoid list is The Chronicles of Riddick. Who even likes Vin Diesel anyways, pure garbage. Second is King Arthur. All I can say to that is what the hellâ€¦ Third is White Chicks. Even though it may provide some entertainment in the form of crude jokes and/or physical humour, it is pure garbage. Fourth is Garfield the Movie. Cartoon to movie conversions are always disastrous. Don't be expecting too much from this one.   Sorry I put you through my stupid ranting about movies I hate and like. I just felt in the mood to talk about some movies. And I think it is a good idea to warn people about upcoming, hour and a half long, shit throwing festivals. Don't go see this movies unless you are intoxicated, and try the movie extra thing, its pretty funny. Here are some genius movies that I really enjoyed a lot in case you care. For those who don't, don't bother reading this part if you hated the entire thing so far.   Confidence (2003), starring Edward burns, Andy Garcia, and Dustin Hoffman, was an amazing movie. Runaway Jury (2004), starring Dustin Hoffman once again, Gene Hackman, and John Cusack, was also a really good film. The Bourne Identity (2002), starring Matt Damon, is a really good movie. If you haven't seen these already, you should. Oh and Le Papillion, a French film, was a very moving story if your into movies that make you feel really happy about life at the end.
urlLink    When the sky is dark and cloud filled, and the thunder beggins to crack, some would run for the hills or duck for cover. I simply listen. I listen to the splendor that is thunder. If you think about it, the sound it makes pretty much represents power. So think about it.&nbsp; u
