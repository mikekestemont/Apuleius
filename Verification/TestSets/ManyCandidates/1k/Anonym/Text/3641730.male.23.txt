stance I came to my senses. This was Amanda’s sister’s friend. Whew! Another minute and she would have been a two run shot to deep right field. So, I go into the bedroom after I Scooby Dooed the situation in the living room and asked Amanda if we were running a homeless shelter. She said, “No”. I agreed. My attention was then turned to changing clothes and going out for some breakfast.     Amanda told me that she wouldn’t go out and eat breakfast with me this morning if I wore my Lightning Girls 16 & Under Fast Pitch Softball t-shirt. This absurdity almost made me lose my cool. I realize that the shirt is somewhat on the ridiculous side, being that I’m an overweight twenty-three year old male, but still. It’s not like the shirt has any holes, nor is it two sizes too small for my manly frame. I just couldn’t understand what she had against my Goodwill garment. Suddenly, lightning struck(pun intended)! Most of my clothes are from the Goodwill. I then realized that Amanda obviously hates charity and therefore hates my shirts by association. This thought brought tears to my beautiful blue eyes. I couldn’t believe it! My fiancée hates philanthropy.   After I cried on the inside for about an hour I tried to come to a conclusion based on the facts of the matter. I wasn't able to come up with an explanation that was more lenient towards the impoverished. Today is a black day indeed.
Here we are at the United State’s 228th birthday. Huzzah, I guess. Unfortunately, I feel like I’m at the birthday party of someone that I used to be really great friends with, but for whatever reason we’ve grown apart. I think I know why America and I aren’t pals anymore, but I honestly hope that we can mend our differences and resume a happy coupling.   I often wonder why I should try to repair my friendship with America. The Republic that I came to know and love seems distant and unreachable. I don’t know where the qualities that originally attracted me to America have gone. I miss the civil liberties, separation of church and state, strong and fair foreign policy, and the quality domestic economic growth of years past. The America that I knew would never let legislation rule the lives of its citizens. Corporations and the wealthiest 1% wouldn’t be able to legislate for the other 99% of the population. Where has the Republic gone and what has assumed its identity?   I don’t like the doppelganger that calls itself The United States of America. A sad and cruel joke has replaced the bastion of freedom and equality that once stood in this very same place. Perhaps in a few years America will turn around and remember what made it the greatest nation that history has ever seen. It is more likely that I will remember the United States of America’s 228th birthday as the final chapter of our friendship and the beginning of the long and terrible fall of the R
