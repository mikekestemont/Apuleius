i rent the bottom of a large, old house. i used to rent the top of it, but moved down to the bottom about a month ago. (separate entrances, so i don't share space)  i never realized how creaky the floor upstairs is, or how much you can hear from up there, until my new neighbor moved in.   he's a new resident at the hospital up the street. at 4 am most mornings i can hear him up there clomping around.   it never fails to wake me up.  and i haven't failed to be grumpy about it.  but on the 4th of july, my neighbor rang my bell and asked me if i could hear him up there, and if so, he was terribly sorry.   i smiled and said it was ok, that he can't help the creaking floor, and that i can sleep through anything (a lie).   this morning at 4 am, i awakened to the sound of clomping feet, but it didn't seem to bother me.  it was still dark out. i got out of bed, turned on the light above the garage for him, and got back under the covers.   and i slept.
