pocket gopher get fed Saltines from the kiddos. We'll tell Travis, the chef extraordinaire of the Mt. Lemmon Cafe, that he's a genius. We'll look at the white lights on a white tent and understand that white on white can be a good thing, especially at a cooler elevation. We'll watch the tourists and the townies and try to discern who is who. We'll wish for live music and then look at the wildflowers that grow on the moutainside. Afterwards, we'll go to Inspiration Rock or hike a portion of the Butterfly Trail. We'll look at the burn-out of a forest that's as alive as any of us, maybe more so. We'll feel our hearts in our throats and the sticky sweet perspiration that accompanies uphill climbs. We'll be sombered by the 25-mile-per-hour constant curves. We'll maybe personify the mountain as a woman and we'll give thanks for seeing a roadrunner in flight. We'll listen to Mozart, Marley and Matthews on the world rock station and then put concerto and nature in the same category of beauty.  Afterwards, on the drive down, you'll see an Arizona sunset and I'll be thankful you're in my passenger seat. The air will be hotter going down, but the memories will be sweeter upon decline.
Destination Reached, Journey Begins  Greetings from Tucson! A place where you may bring your water bottles in movie theaters, where residents know their cardinal directions thanks to the amazing mountains located to the North, East & West, where produce is fresh and local, and where "swamp coolers" and "air conditioning" mean two very different things. I am here. I am well. I survived a hailstorm in Shamrock, Tx. My load, consequently, is a little lighter, a little wetter than I expected, but washing machines and clothing lines dry out what I salvaged and saved. Here, the laundry drys in 20 minutes on hot days. It's taking a bit longer in the two days I've been here, but I'm patient and ecstatic about inhaling sun-dried jeans and underwear and t-shirts.  * * *  I bought a bed today from Corrine at Sleep America. I hugged her before she made the sale. She hugged me back and, if she understood how long I've been without this padding, she'd probably have hugged me harder. I have a red bedspread and white sheets and sheer curtains where Saraswati, my Indian muse from my friend Aruna, looks over me and my endeavors in art, education and life.  My roommates are amazing and they humble me. They are smart, have amazing vocabularies and are helpful, cheerful and focused. They are Quaker. I feel like they will help me become an even better Kella. I'm excited.  Tomorrow, I buy a bike. I'll swim at the city pool with my little sister. I'll pick up my bed. I'll set it up. I'll lie down and look at my white walls and listen to Howlin' Wolf and the barking dogs next door. Then, I'll take a deep breath and take a nap. I think I've earned it. I miss y
