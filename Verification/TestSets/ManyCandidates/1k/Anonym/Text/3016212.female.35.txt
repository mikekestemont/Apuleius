there. My other naighbors have teenage kids that stay outside on the street til midnite or later and drive backwards up and down the street and yell and whatnot and leave fast food garbage in my yard. I live in a upperscale neighborhood so all I can think of is that the world is growing more ignorant everyday....
I have figured out my problem and it seems to be OTHER PEOPLE. I would not say all ppl , just the majority of ppl. Im so sick of my neighbors telling me all about my yard because they have lived in this area longer than me & explaining how all the trees in my yard that are new trees are wild trees and how I should cut them down. I think the world needs more trees , I mean isnt thousands being cut down in our rain forests as I type ? I dont see the harm in a few trees being in my yard even if they are on the other side of her fence. I am told by my neighbors "my plants wont grow, they cant get sun !" you know cause of MY TREES. I dont think anyone in the world cares if her plants dont get sun and I do care If ya lean over the fence and cut my trees down.
Look at the big picture here folks, GEESH. We need more trees!
I have a friend , he asked me to not name him , he is 57 and has been a victim of identity theft thru his checking account. He understands the problems with identity theft and increasing technology and that losers exist that do this... what he cant come to terms with is Bank One telling him it could take 5 years to complete the investigation. He has had $2300.00 since February stolen from him and one amount in this amount was big enough that the bank notified the FBI. The biggest problem he is facing is that he has not received his money back from the bank. Bank One has no immediate intention of giving him his money back. He is retired. He once bounced his mortgage payment when the theft first occured. I just wanted all that bank with Bank One to know this. What if $2300.00 disappeared out of your checking account and you couldnt get it back.. what if all the money you had was in your account and then poof then next day its gone. What would you do ? The bank is going to do NOTHING and you my friend are SOL.
