forehead rapping, and find out why  Annie  is the best soap baddie since Alexis removed her gloves and those Gucci glasses to destroy Blakes defense in Dynasty...    Hey and the weather is back to hot! Woo Hoo!     Mike x
Just a quick hi to my flatmate Mark (the Lovely Glinda). Who I said I'd give a mention to today. Bless him he's finally got a decent tan without the use of rubber gloves or gravy block. And he looks darn sexy for it as well.  Well the weather is having an identity crisis as well, rain, heat, rain, heat, rain?! Oh well at least it's not cold.  Got my best mate Mark "Sue-Ellen" Holding round tonight for tea and a gossip. (and to watch Clue - quite possibly the funniest film of the 80s - well intentionally funny, Grease 2 was funny for all the wrong reasons). This evening is bound to deteriorate due to our penchant for bargain bin wine at rocket fuel strength. Well at least we don't pretend we have any class I guess...  Mike x
Well I finally got round to getting myself a blogspot. It'll be handy for me as much as anyone to know what I've been upto.  What a great weekend.  Went to Balans on friday for a delicious slap up meal topped off with irish coffee and brandy. Then back to bed earlyish for the next days festivites...  Brighton Pride on saturday was the most fabulous day I've had for a long time. The day started with a cooked brekkie at Dan and Stu's fabby new pad. Followed by a very nice train complete with the nice people at South Central (trains, not Dukes) decking out ' H  a  p  p  y   P  r  i  d  e ' carriages.  Got to the park and generally had a great day. Got nicely out of it and thought we were in Greece for half an hour or so. Which was nice. (although not that out of it to know that the lesbian couple with the baby that were taking MDMA while in charge of said baby was seriously    WRONG  ! )  Then more merriment and dancing (we were taking bets on how many times we would hear Lolas theme, which incidentally as any gayer will know we've had in clubs for about a year and are so past.) Before we shot off for the train back to Londinium. Deftly followed (well I say deftly. The train home took about two hours and stopped at every Lamp post, plus Dan was having a personal nirvana in trying to find a cashpoint near Victoria) by a couple of cheeky ones in Barcode and then onto XXL. Which was a good laugh.  More drinks and Chilling back at Dan and Stu's flat followed by three hours sleep meant yesterday was pretty much a write off. Was back home monging on the sofa and asleep by nine last night - what a good boy am I...  More wry comments and comedy when I think of some (hey it's Monday!)  Mike x
