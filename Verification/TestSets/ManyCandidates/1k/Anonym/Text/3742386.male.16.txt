sit there for an hour and a half waiting for our train to come to take us back to union station. there were the weirdest people there. well at the zoo too. there was this fifty year old lady whos butt hung out of her shorts. it was thoroughly disgusting. and then the eighty year old in short shorts and a tube top. her boobs dragged the ground. no lie. it was nasty. and there were about 400 amish people there. no lie. it was pretty funny. beard, hats, suspenders, etc. all the kids had the exact same haircut. all the girls wore these little hats. it was weird. we ran into them about five hundred times. the same ones. hehe. then the people at the hollywood station going back. omg. these two girls decide theyre gonna take off their shoes and run around in the middle of the three lane train tracks. i was like 'omg you retards move' and then a train comes and their dad is yelling at them to move their asses. and theyre like 'i dont see a train. where?' little did they realize it was coming behind them. so they move with about five seconds to spare and the train comes flying by at like 80. scared the hell outta me. lol. then we move to the other side of the tracks cuz we realize the train we need to get on comes from the other way. so we do, and theres this annoying guy who decides he has to try out every single ring tone on his phone for everyone to hear. then, out of nowhere, he starts making elephant noises for like ten minutes. thank god, the train came shortly. we got on, rode it back to union station. once there we find out the train back to bartlett doesnt leave til like 8:40. so we have a good hour or better left. we sat around til the train came, got on and had a hell of a time findind seats. we walked to the far end of the train to get some and even then, our car filled up really fast. the train back to btown took like, an hour or so. we pulled in at 9:40. i was home by like ten and dead tired. talk to anna on the phone for a bit and went to sleep. i was exhausted. in a fit of sleepyness i set my alarm for 8 thinking id have to be at work today by 9:30. i misjudged. i really have to be there at 11:30. so ive had three hours to just sit around doing nothing. gotta work til 5 something today and then im prolly gonna do something with anna afterwards. its 11:05 now. gotta roll soon. guess im done here.
