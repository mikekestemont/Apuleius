One reason columnists and comedians will be sad to see President Bush go is because of the loss of actual quotes to write and joke about.  He's a cornucopia of material. For instance yesterday the President spoke to a rally in nearby Annandale, Virginia.  As reported in The DailyPress.com (Hampton, Virginia):   "Bush criticized Kerry's plan to eliminate the tax cuts for those making more than $200,000 a year, saying that the "the rich in America happen to be the small business owners" who put people to work.    Bush also said high taxes on the rich are a failed strategy because "the really rich people figure out how to dodge taxes anyway."    Kind of reminds you of the clip in Fahrenheit 9/11 where the President talks to his supporters, "...The Haves and the Have More," at a black tie dinner. If I follow his logic we should do away with many of our laws because criminals figure out to dodge them anyway. Hmmmmm.   However there's a statement in the last paragraph of the story by a Bush supporter at the rally.  Talking about Kerry supporters who were protesting at the rally, she said,   "I just look at them and smile," she said.  "They're damn lucky to be in this country because they would be backslapped if they lived anywhere else. I just pray that they will open their eyes."    I have to agree with her that it is a privilege to have the freedom to express ones feelings, but I get the feeling that she's one of those people who think it's OK to express ones feelings as long as you agree with me.

I can't think of a better way to initiate my blog than by posting the exchange President Bush had with an American Indian reporter at a conference for minority journalists. Go to this link:  urlLink http://www.majorityreportradio.com/weblog/archives/000581.php  and get ready to both laugh and scratch your head.  When one reflects on all the gaffes and poor decisions (wrong, misinformed, uninformed, corrupt, cast with a blind eye, etc.) this president has made, I honestly wonder how anyone can:  1) Be proud to have voted for Bush 43 2) Speak up for him today 3) Vote for him tomorrow 4) Claim him as one of yours  In my years of voting eligibility I have never supported a candidate who was the embarassment that Bush 43 has been and currently is. In 2000 I said that I couldn't vote for a candidate who was no smarter than I. In 2004 I say that I not only can't vote for him, but I will communicate information and arguments to hopefully open voter's eyes. I hate to paint whole groups of people with a broad brush, but in this world of sound-bite attention spans I advance the following: In the 1980s I came to the conclusion that the Republican Party was the party of 'I Got Mine.' George W. Bush is the poster child for that party c
