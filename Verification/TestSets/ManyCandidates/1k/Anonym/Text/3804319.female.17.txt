thought it was fleeing from the rain, like most birds do. but then i saw it flash past my window again, so i left my bed and went to the window, and i saw that there were in fact 2 swifts. they were chasing each other across the rooftops, around and around in the same circle, out of my sight behind some buildings and then back around in front again, past my window. they looked as much as if they were enjoying it as they do when they're tiny pin-pricks flying higher than you could imagine in a blazing blue summer sky. i wished then that i had a video camera, so i could film them flying around and around in the drizzle, flashing in and out of view, with the backdrop of greys and browns of the wet town, and the doves grinding out of my cd player behind.
I can feel the length of summer holidays setting in. every day seems white and long and muffled.  i threw out all my old diaries yesterday. i found them in a shoe box under my dexk. it only took a few minutes flicking through them to realise there is nothing more painful and embarassing than old diaries. i wrote them when i was in high school, they're full of crushes and angst. it felt good to throw them away, it's probably a bad thing to run away from your past, but it felt good. at the moment, being rid of such memories is worth sacrificing a moment in the future when i'm all grown up, reading them again with a tear running down my cheek for my lost youth or whatever. what i really didn't like about them though, aside from the content, from what i actually wrote, was my handwriting. you could see in the very way i formed the letters how i was struggling between childhood and adulthood, and how i was in limbo, not in one place nor in the other. i could see the haste of an adult's writing combined with wide round letters and as much neat style as a child. i don't like the way i used to write. yes, the old handwriting distressed me. i'm waiting for the post. yes. now theres some nice handwriting, theres some handwriting i wouldn't mind seeing again. i wouldn't mind seeing my name written by that hand.
i bought a green silk headscarf today for Â£1.25 (extortionate price... but it is nice) from a charity shop. it smells like old ladies. i bought 2 t shirts, a shirt and a pair of mens jeans from various other charity shops. one had a changing room that smelt so pungently of medicine that i had to breathe through my mouth.
and then the world turned powder-blue, the pink people on the beach looked like a martin parr photo, the sailing boats on the horizon were almost sickeningly picturesque, the cliffs sang jonathan richman, banksy spray-painted the sky, and as the sea stole my breath i asked the seagull "is my life a f
