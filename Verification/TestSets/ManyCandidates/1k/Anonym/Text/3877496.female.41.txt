silence isn't what it's cracked up to be.
I spoke in an update about how some people have REAL problems.  I was taking school supplies to a local children's charity, which also houses the only United Way Food Bank in our area.  There were 3 families waiting in the hot sun for food.  Now  urlLink DJG  , her daughter, and I have worked at this food bank preparing the bags of food that are given out and it's not a lot.  They don't get the fun food. When I called back later in the afternoon, the secretary told me that they had served 121 families and the day wasn't over.   Here I am paying $11 a week to attend Weight Watchers because I've been eating too much and there are folks who get one bag a month from a food bank.  I know that they get food from other sources but it hurts my heart to see children that don't get Oreo's and Hawaiian Punch!  Visit your local food bank and take your children.  It's a humbling and eye-opening experience
The Richard Petty Driving Experience at Talladega is full for next Friday!!  Oh well, I'll just go another time.  My brother would've wanted to go with me anyway.  I prayed today to have the best day ever and to help someone else have the best day ever!  So I'm gonna get out there and look for someone who needs a great day!  If your day isn't starting out good, come to Alabama - I'll be looking for you!
Tonight, I helped do athletic physicals for our area schools.  Since I'm not clinical, I got to weigh the athletes.  Just for fun, I would try to guess the athletes' weight... I'll never get a job at the county fair!  I got a little cocky and told one of the guys to guess my age but, take off 5 years so he wouldn't hurt my feelings.  He guessed 35!!!!!!  It was like a knife straight to the heart - It's so terrible to think you're cool and then finally realize that you're old!   I still had a lot of fun and got much better on guessing weight.  Notice that I asked for the guy to guess my age and not my weight!  I was not the big loser at WW today - That's ok, I'll get 'em next week!  Football season is upon  us.  Go watch a high school football game, just the sound of the drums will take you back to the glory days.
urlLink DJG  and I are in charge of games at Wednesday Camp (Mid-week fun for the kids at church).  We've played FAITH (a spin on BINGO), Bible Baseball, a balloon popping trivia game... I need some help!  Our next night for games is August 18.  Bring on the ideas.  We have 15 minutes with 3-5th graders and 15 minutes with K-2.     This year, our Bible School isn't even serving red Kool-Aid!  Isn't that just wrong?   It can't be that they're afraid we'll stain the carpet... my broken nose took care of t
