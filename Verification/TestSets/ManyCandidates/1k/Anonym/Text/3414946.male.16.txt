Mood:  Happy :)  Listening To:  Nothing, too late  Wow, wasted Monday and Tuesday. Dossed, played games, surfed, chatted. Had a good bitching session with craig tho. Really dislike Mark; have no real problem with Ben, but how he begs it from ben and paddy is sorta sad.  Aidans grandad had a heart attack, hence the shortage of him. Jo was at Marks for 2 nights, hence her shortage. I'll be out to the cinema tomorrow, maybe with a review for the blog, who knows.  Reason for happiness?...Ryan. Pretty damn cute guy. Sweet, never been in a relationship before. Seems well decent, heh fallen in love (L) but yeah he's well cool and we'll prolly be meeting, w00t!  Short sweet post. I think I post more when depressed :/  PS:- Reading Dead Air by Iain Banks, pretty good so far, excellent Author.  End Transmission
Mood:  Fairly Happy  Listening To:  Bit of Elton John    &nbsp;  What can I say, I've been busy? GCSE's were fun...well tiring for sure, but everything seems to be ok. et up with a guy on the last day of exams, got quite excited about it...for nothing, the guy was a let down...pretencious and the rest.    &nbsp;  Saturday after met up with Katie and Alec, mates of Aidan, went to their school fair, dropped of a card because Aidans grandad died.    &nbsp;  Met up with Jo, Lucy, Aidan and Kerry the next Sunday to go and watch the mens final. Party at the common afterwards. Gathering on the common the next day.    &nbsp;  Since then its been on/off gatherings of mates.    &nbsp;  However last night I stayed round Aidan's, I mean nothings wrong with that at all. He's probably the person in the world ive most been able to connect with, whereas with Jo we can talk easily and we can just bond easily.    &nbsp;  Jo thinks I fancy Aidan, and this is where the pointless worrying begins, because when someone sayd you fancy someone else invitably it ends up happing if you find the other person attractive, and I think it may be. Which would be a waste of time. I respect his sexuality pretty much as I expect he respects mine, as I understand he's straight, it's just the pointless speculation and consideration which will do no good.    &nbsp;  I'm getting on well with this guy called Nick. Though he doesnt see himself being with a guy for the rest of his life which is slightly disheartening, however is the catch as all good things have in life.    &nbsp;  I'm pretty sure I'll end it there....for how long....I myself dont even know.    &
