you have figured what they might do and then they turn around and do the complete opposite. Yes, I know a lot of people are like that. That's life. I'm exhausted so here's a weird fact. Thinking about Eric reminded me of this fact. Guys that wear glasses, I find really sexy. It's not because I wear them. It's usually guys that wear the glasses for reading or driving. I don't why but it's really sexy when they wear those glasses. This is the case with a lot of guys I've been attracted to in the past. Eric, Steve, others.... Call me crazy and get it over with : ) I just love it : ) More later......
That's me : p No, really. I had a nice weekend, albeit a little crazy. Friday I went with Rory to see my friend Rameen in Ragtime. I've already posted about that. Saturday, set construction for Stage Door and a little rehearsal. We've gotten Act 3 , Scene 1 down to 23 minutes which is decent. Hopefully it'll be less than that tomorrow night. I stayed at the theatre until about 3:15 on Saturday. Then I went to my Daddo's 50th birthday party. We had it at my cousin's house. It was great. She has a pool and it was such a beautiful day. Lots of theatre folks were there and everyone had a great time. Ro and I then went back to the theatre to help put in the steps. Well, since neither of us are very good carpenters, we ended up writing Ro's bio and the directors' notes, finally!!!! The directors' notes are very good. A little sappy but we feel very strongly about this show and the young actors involved. Anyway, then I drove Ro home and we watched Road Rules and waited for Kathe to come home. When she got there, we read her Ro's bio which she thought was very high and mighty even for him : ) I went home and fell asleep late.  Then this morning I had to get up and try to get to the theatre on time. Of course, I didn't get there until about 12:30. There was lots of stuff to do, though. Finish painting the floor, clean the risers off, put another rack for costumes upstairs, put a railing on the steps onstage. Much, much stuff. And it all got done. At 7pm, we had a Q 2 Q and it was long. We got out of there about 10:15 or maybe even after that. I was so exhausted that I came straight home. Did I go to sleep? No, of course not. I have to finish the program and send it to the woman who is printing our programs. I better check my bio. I might be sending an old one. I hope that I'm with it enough to make sure I send the right one :) Rehearsal every night this week and we open on Friday!!!!! Oh my goodness. Are we ready? I sure as hell hope so. More l
