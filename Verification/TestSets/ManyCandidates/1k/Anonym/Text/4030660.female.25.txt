when I'm not aroundAnd I know that your eyes see straight through meAnd speak to me without a sound   I want to hold youProtect you from all of the things I've already endured I want to show youShow you all the things that this life has in store for youI'll always love you    The way that a father should love his daughter   When I walked out this morningI cried as I walked to the doorI cried about how long I'd be away for   I cried about leaving you all alone Sweet Zoe Jane    So I wanted to say this Cuz I wouldn't know where to begin    To explain to you what I have been through   To explain where your daddy has been... Sweet Zoe Jane"   that is... if papa was still here and if i am... ever gonna be wed...    someone that i used to know has left me once again... nuthin new in that sense... i guess he just finds joy in doing stuffs like that to me... ME- the masochistic... *sigh*      and i smell someone leaving me soon... for reasons so typical of someone with his track of mind... pity... not that im thinkin of holding him still... he wants me to look at him "differently" from the way the "usual" people look at him... i am giving him that chance... but my patience is near its end... and i being a cynic.. has no hope left in me...   i want to find a way out of all this...   i need to find me...

Away from the sun again   I'm over this I'm tired of living in the dark    Can anyone see me down here...    The feeling's gone-     There's nothing left to lift me up   Back into the world I've known      'Cause now again I've found myself So far down, away from the sun    That shines into the darkest place I'm so far down, away from the sun    That shines the life away from me    To find my way back into the arms That care about the ones like me I'm so far down, away from the sun again    It's down to this I've got to make this life make sense    And now I can't do what I've done    And now again I've found myself So far down, away from the sun    That shines the life away from me 'Cause now again I've found myself So far down, away from the sun    That shines into the darkest place I'm so far down, away from the sun    That shines the life away from me To find my way back into the arms    That care about the ones like me I'm so far down,    away from the sun a
