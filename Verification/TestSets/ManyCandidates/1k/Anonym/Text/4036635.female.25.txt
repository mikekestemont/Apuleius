according to this week, she's not pregnant...it's only a matter of time...        I don't care about Ricco's problems.           Claire and Mena Suvari's character, finally already. Ever since the first episode where they introduced Mena (Eddy?) you knew that Claire could not get enough of her electric personality. But, I have no bets on what will happen...although, being gay tends to run in families. I know of at least three families, personally, that have at least two children who ended up being gay. Then again, this is a TV show. I just like the whole struggle Claire goes through which she says something to the effect of "half of me wants this but the other half doesn't...but what if that other half doesn't want this because it's just scared." I dismiss ideas sometimes on the same premise, and then I rethink it because what if the other half is just scared.           They teased us last week with the rebirth of the David/Nate dynamic, which I have always enjoyed. And although there was less this week, I appreciate the nod to Nate's support of David's behaviors as a result of the random trauma from two episodes ago. But, I would like to see more, and it appears we just may as David continues on his downward spiral.     And props go out to Kathy Bates and Patricia Clarkson, whom I always enjoy. James Cromwell's character, love to hate him, creepy man--"that'll do pig."--Babe But let's wrap that up, shall we...      Hold up, Tracey Morgan is on Def Poetry.      OK, nothing really that impressive from Tracey there.         Anyway, I had a good weekend here in Michigan visiting friends and family, primarily in town for a bridal shower that was today's all-day extravaganza. Went to bed at 4:30am, got up at 9:15am to go set up for a bridal shower at 5pm. The event planners did a fantastic job, and I was pleased to be able to help out. Except for the loading and unloading of folding chairs and tables, taking them up and down two flights of stairs. We had help, but it was hot as hell out today, too. Anyway, the couple was happy and the party went well. Yea.       I've been able to spend some time with my most beautiful niece, who will be two in November. Sometimes I think I have never seen a more beautiful child. Makes me think maybe I will actually want one of my own someday, but then again there's no guarantee I will ever have such a cute, smart kid. The family says that they can't get over how much she looks and acts like me, especially comparing at that age, I'm flattered, but god help her at the same time!! She's fantastic though, and it makes my heart hurt to leave her and go back to Chicago. Love her.      I have been so inspired to write this weekend, but now that I am here, I guess I don't have that much poetic flow to share. Wow, KRS-ONE and Doug e Fresh have something to say...      O
