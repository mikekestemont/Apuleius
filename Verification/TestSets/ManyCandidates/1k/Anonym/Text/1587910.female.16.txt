don't kiss your best friend's ex boyfriend. you will not be forgiven. 2. if you want to lose your virginity in a way that your friends don't agree with, don't tell them. 3. if you really truly don't want something found out, don't tell anyone, including your best friend. 4. this has nothing to do with the price of apples. meaning: you shouldn't change all the things you're used to being if they have nothing to do with the way your friend got screwed over. and just in general, don't change for anyone other than yourself. 5. it's hard to get your head around not being friends with someone anymore. 6. when your mother tells you that you're not compatible with friends, listen to her. 7. if people feel the need to check up on you all the time, they're not your friends **with the exception of having serious drug related problems, which i DO NOT have. 8. i want to say something really mean here but i feel bad for the person.  that's it. that's my list. i think that sums everything up. i'm drained now. time to go read or something.  song of the moment: the last frame ~a match like memory  ``best friends till  the end  but not by my watch..``
its been awhile since i've posted, but nothing really has happened.. i've hung out with daniela a lot recently, which is really awesome, she gave me this amazing haircut and it just looks great.. last saturday stine's rents were out of town, so uhh let's rent a keg at 11:30 in the morning? lol.. boys + alcohol + empty house + renee = trouble lol, let's leave it at that. but that was a good day.. the parts i can remember clearly at least, lol. ohhh and i have pharyngitis.. yes, it came late this year, i thought i was done with that nonsense lol.. and they're still waiting to see if i have mono, so whatever. but anyway.. my doctor told me i had it, and i'm like omg is it contagious? and he goes yeah from "deep kissing" so i'm like.. that's chill then lol.. i think i've figured some things out, you know? except well i haven't totally, but i've narrowed some things down.. like kevin for instance.. i haven't realized it till now, but we've been talking/fighting since may, i think that says something.. even through the fights. i don't know. it's a weird feeling. but there's also someone else that's so.. new. and i want to say i don't know how i feel about any of this. but i think the biggest problem is that i know what i want to do, i just know it's not right, and very stereotypical summer of me. i guess only time will tell, right?      song of the moment:   little devotional ~taking back sunday (((warped tour today!!!!)))      ``do you think  she'd  be  better  at doing what   i do best  ?   i mean really, i know you're down for competition.   but  this could all be on purpose .
