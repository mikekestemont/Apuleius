day. My 2nd Aunt (my mum's side) came to my house in the morning to settle the stocks (bracelets) with my mum. I think she came about 11am which I was still lying on the bed. Then mum called me up to ask whether want to join lunch together on Vietnam foods. I quickly got up and meet my aunt.  Then another aunt came (my uncle's wife) to see the bracelets. They were talked and negociated almost more than 2 hours. After that we ahead to have our lunch. My 2nd Aunt called a set lunch for 4-5 paxs which have 6 different kinds of dishes with rice. Marvellous dishes and delicious!  p/s: I forgotten to take the foods' pictures cos I was so hungry and too excited to taste the foods! ;)  &nbsp;  urlLink    Lunch at Restaurant Vietnam Kitchen, Citrus Park, OUG.&nbsp; urlLink
Last Friday, for no what-so-ever reason I got to treat Michael for a dinner. As he said seem I earned some money from the freelance works should gave him a treat as I was a richer than him. :)  So I let him to decide where to eat but he couln't think of anything, so I just suggested just eat at Dome. We headed to Bangsar Shopping Complex. I called Spicy Spaghetti&nbsp; and Lime drink where else Michael called Fish n Chip (as usual) with Ice Lemon Tea. We called an additional food which for as our starter, Mushroom soup seem Michael was darn hungry. The dinner was great and cost me RM60++.  After dinner, we went to Cold Storage Supermarket to buy my ladies' stuff. There I bumped some Qoo drinks which was I wanted them so much seem is hardly to get them in Malaysia. I bought 3 cans which cost me RM6++. My favourite Qoo! Ahhh....~   urlLink     Dinner at Dome Cafe Bangsar Shopping Complex with Michael.&nbsp; urlLink       urlLink     Qoo drinks.&nbsp; urlLink
On last Thursday, me and Michael were having dinner with his friends (a couple and 1 guy who was reached almost we finished our dishes) at Esquire Kitchen. We called 5 different type of foods and it was really fulled uptight our stomach.&nbsp;We have a great talk; jokes around and talk about the couple's marriage which they have been planned almost a year ago.  Mostly the dinner was something like a mini reunion for Michael and his best friends as well a celebration of Michael's belated birthday.  &nbsp;  urlLink    Dinner at Esquire Kitchen, Mid Valley Megamall with Michael's friends.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink      urlLink     It's been away from here quite a while. I was so damn busy working which I met with the deadline for the publishing.  Therefore, not much happening in my life. Life was so unpredictable when it's gonna to be happened in the next day. But my life was simply normal and not much interesting to nourish.  Life was simple with the normal routine like work...eat...sleep. To entertain or to give a leisure in our life, then only have little of activities going on.  But I do cherish my life as what I am. :
