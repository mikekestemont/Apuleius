better... but today... this is my opinion.
You know I have a full staff of men working for me and one woman. After three days of working with me she quits. Well personally I don't see the loss but it certainly makes me see why I like male crews better. Less sensative. GET OVER IT!!!  Okay I have a question.... How sick and twisted is it when your ex-husband starts calling your current husband's ex-wife to carry on conversations about me. Can you say, obsessed! how about demented???? Jesus Christ Art. Move on with your life and stay ut of mine. I just that's what happens when you see your children as nothing more than meal tickets and in truth that's all it is. They want to come back to Colorado so he buys them each a dog. They said they wanted to come back because they would have their own rooms and space and voila they now have their own rooms. Of course we are going to ignor the fact that for the last year when they have been there Amanda and Randi have had to share a room because Prince Preston was the oldest and Jr. Prince Dustin was the youngest. But now that this will all come before a court they all get their own rooms. Of course everytime he get the opportunity Art makes sure to tell them "You better remember, Dustin gave up his room for you." Get real. no he didn't. He's 5 he didn;t have a choice, Art gave up Dustin's room for them. Ex-husbands suck. By the way Jimmy... thanks for starting to write on the rant again. I have missed it. For everyone else.. If you want some very interesting opinions on things and ways of looking at them check out my uncle's website at  urlLink www.angelfire.com/nv/2001/index.html  and then click on the link for Quad-Rant. I promise it's worth it.
Last night the local rodeo opened. JR, Dan and I all went because the bull riders were riding. Interesting sport i guess but still can't understand the theory behind some scrawny cowboy of 150 pounds getting on a 2000 pound bull and trying to ride it. Yea, its big. Yea, it's mean. and Yea, it can stomp your butt into the dirt. So what? JR says it's the way they're brought up. The "My daddy was a bull rider so I'm a bull rider" mentality. Well my daddy was a violent alcoholic who ran away and joined the circus. Sorry, I'm just not going there.  I did run into my friend Katie Marsh and her sister Jen. After the rodeo we all went to this little saloon called the Brush Creek. Pretty loud, very crowded and at times entertaining. Amazing how many people can;t hold their liquor and just get stupid. However I was impressed that as soon as we got there and walked in the door, Dan handed me the keys to the truck and said You're the designated driver Mrs. MADD Mom. Okay with me. Wish more people were like that. C
