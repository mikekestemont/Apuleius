buy the Inu Yasha episodes and the Yu Yu hakusho Movies so you guys can leave your suggestions for amine to upload in the comment areas.  On to site News I am planning to create some sort of anime shrine to place all of the anime that have been request but wouldn't be worth having a page also expect some media files within this week up, plus a photo gallery, Manga and a Anime TV feed but in the trial mode not to nuke the server.
Sorry about being away so long but I am working on a new site and I am getting all the episode ready to be put up for download and such.  It will be up in a weeks time
Its official the ugly looking boxed shaped design of the Nintendo DS has been changed to a new sleak design.  There were a few pictures released but not much info,  Tommorow in the Nook I will be posting all the info that I have that I have and a couple of pictures.  On the next note I am have the AnimeTV Listing to be posted up at the right time hopefully I will put it up by tommorow night or before.  Well anyway catch y'all later......
I can hardly stay awake but before I go to bed I thought I would make a post to let you guys know what is going on.  The only big thing right now is that a new fan fiction is on the way so expect that soon, and also the Inu yasha movie video I promised and I have a complete TV listing for Anime TV for the coming months.  Well till next time ......... I am out
Well I have added some new Inu Yasha Midis in the music section so you can go check those out.  Also since I know everyone is snxious for the movie I will post some clips soon from the japanese version that I own.  Other than that till next time ...
Well again nothing new to report since the last post except I put up some new videos today and I got some articles from the nook on the way.  But most improtantly I must say that I will not be posting as much now as before due to having finals coming up within 8 to 9 months of such.  But I my two weeks vacation coming up starting Monday so no posts for a little while but I'm going to try to go some new stuff up in advance so that you wont be coming here for nothing.
Well I can offically report that it is a slow week even though it just got started...Since I got no new new bye for now but in the meantime I have an announcement to make Friday so see you then or sooner.
Last night I got all of the media up on my Mediaserver but there is a catch you cant download the media only stream it, but enjoy for until next time as I am making plans to offer downloadable m
