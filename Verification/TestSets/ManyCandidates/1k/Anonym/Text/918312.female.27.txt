a barbecue all in excited anticipation of the main event. I would ask all day, is it dark enough yet? I couldn't look outside and see the sun was still up apparently. My brothers would sate me for a while with the screaming bottle rockets till finally, the sun went down.   Then red, blue, yellow, purple sparks light up the night sky. The sparklers, the roman candles, the jumping jack fire crackers that you'd light and stand far enough back or so you thought but then'd you'd have to run in another direction as they chased you all over the yard.  Fountains in every color, white streakes shooting into the sky then exploding with a loud pop. And even my families favorite, the egg laying chicken firework. Nothing says July 4th like a paper chicken shooting white hot colored eggs out it's rear end then bursting into flame.  I loved it all. My parents would sit back, drinking and watch us having a good time. You could see. They loved it. We'd always run out of the big stuff but never bottle rockets and those would be saved till New Years when at the stroke of midnight we'd set the last of them off too, standing in our pajamas in the freezing cold.   So here it is July 4th, 2004. I smell horrid from the Off Skintastic and being sweaty all day. I just got back from a bar with my friends. I have to work in the morning so I should be in bed. But instead I grabbed the citronella candle, a diet coke and sat for 30 minutes enjoying my neighbors shoot off their fireworks. My next door neighbors leaned on their deck and we chatted for a few minutes. All smiles and light. They complimented my new grill. I thanked them and invited them over next weekend for a barbecue. Then we quieted down and watched the sky turn colors and the wind blew my way and I got that smell. Fireworks powder.   I sat back in my chair and just did jack chit for a few minutes, thanked ole Tom Jefferson and the bunch for deciding they didn't like England and drank my diet coke. Said a small prayer to the fireworks boy and thanked him kindly for lighting my night up for so many years. Smiled for a bit and just watched the sky as new stars were added for a few seconds. Red ones, blue ones, purple, white, and green ones. Then they went away.   I grabbed my diet coke, took one last look as my neighbors set off a huge chrysthansimum looking firework. It streaked upward above my house with a golden tail, then popped and burst into the sky lighting the whole neighborhood up in a shower of purple then white. Then it rained down in little gold sparkles.  It reminded me so much of a saying. Life is not measured by how many breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away. Today was a breathtaker.  Happy Independence D
