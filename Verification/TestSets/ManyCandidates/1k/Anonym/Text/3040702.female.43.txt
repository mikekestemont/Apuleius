to your pattern over the week or the month. That's how you (I) become fanatic about dieting: keeping those "exceptions" under control, making sure they don't become the norm. It's easy to freak over one incident, because you're on such a tightrope. You're not supposed to obsess about food, that's bad, versus you're supposed to count all your food and keep a detailed food diary, that's good. Huh? Run that by me again?  Speaking of food diaries, I don't put my food online for two reasons: 1. I'm lazy. In fact, I'm too lazy to come up with a second reason. But I find it useful once in a while to see what other people are eating. It gives me ideas. So here, just for kicks, is the record of what I ate on Monday, June 28, with calories in parens:*     1 cup coffee with sugar, creamer, and Benefiber (38); half a can of Southwestern Chicken soup (120); / Healthy Choice salisbury steak entree (360); slice of fresh pineapple and some celery (40); / homemade vegetable pasta salad with parmesan cheese (445); lettuce and red pepper salad with oil and vinegar dressing (90); 1 glass wine (90); / half a cup of frozen raspberries (66). = 1249.  The slashes indicate breaks, or meals, or however you want to define it. One reason I'm getting away with such low calories for so much food is the proportion of ingredients. For instance, the vegetable pasta salad is 90% vegetables and 10% pasta. The oil and vinegar dressing is mostly vinegar. Here is what I ate on a higher calorie day, Friday June 25:     1 cup coffee with sugar, creamer, and Benefiber (38); 1 cup red grapes (110); lettuce and red pepper salad with oil and vinegar dressing (90); / half ounce cheese (86); 1 carrot (30); / 2 eggs (150); ground turkey (193); 1 cup red grapes (110); / 1 martini (240); salad with meat and oil and vinegar dressing (350); / half ounce cheese (86); 3 glasses wine [18 oz] (360) = 1843.  That last was during  urlLink Hungry Hormone Hippo  week.  I felt like I could NOT STOP eating, but in retrospect, it's not that bad. 1843 calories is not a huge amount of food. While I was looking back for examples of a high calorie day, I saw two situations in which I go way over my range (like 2400 calories): 1. When I have something other than soup for breakfast. It's hard to beat 120 calories and still eat something satisfying, so when I try something else I inevitably end up with a couple hundred calories added on before I've hardly started the day, plus I am still hungry, which leads to more eating. 2. Large drinking and/or eating in restaurants.  *Yep, here's that footnote, at last. The way I figure calories is thus: if there is nutritional info on the package, I use that. If there isn't, I use Netzer's "The Complete Book of Food Counts."  If that is inadequate (it's sometimes confusing) I use  urlLink this w
