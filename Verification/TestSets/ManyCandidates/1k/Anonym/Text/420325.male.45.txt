to be a 24-hour anime channel coming to America sometime in the near future, which should be pretty cool.
Went to the Anime Expo yesterday in Anaheim and took some pics of the funsters in another reality right here on good old planet Ganymede, uh, Earth. I met Peter from J-list, linkage over there on the sidebar under  urlLink Yellow Fever , and various and sundry not so readily identifiable peoples. If you're interested this will be the subject of a little review with more pics on my  urlLink other  blog , the one that I'm sending my potential employers to as examples of my writing. Don't feel obliged though, a few people that read this thing can't stand the other one, and those readers tend to find this one a bit juvenile. They should see the xanga one.     Met a new white guy in Di Vang tonight, Mickey. Ed and I always joke about meeting other white guys at the cafes, threatening to throw them out so we can keep the numbers down. The idea, of course is that we should try to make contact with the Vietnamese customers to expand our 'simplistic American' horizons. Of course mostly we just talk to the girls. At least I do. I've only met one creepy white guy so far, the rest have been OK. Mickey is pretty cool, a graphic designer and writer, and the girls seem to like him too. He's young, he's committed no crime, he can stay.  I went to meet the publisher of the local paper today, missed him, and wound up talking to the publisher of a local Vietnamese weekly in the same building.

I've given a copy to the lovely Monique to peruse and fill me in on what the locals are yabbering about so I can tailor something to the demographic.  Post Lakers (arghh!) the TVs are tuned to soccer, or as we say here, funny euro-football, interspersed tonight with Christina Aguilera videos. I was thinking about this today, and the reason why soccer (or euro-f-ball) is so popular is testament to the success of Empire. You know, the Spanish, French, Belgian, Dutch, and British ones. Here in the land of the free, we reject empire, and funny football, and rightly so. We've conquered Japan with baseball, but only after, you know, the bomb and all that. And we are slowly conquering Europe with basketball because of how much money we pay these guys, and we only take half their money in taxes (unless they manage to get good accountants, in which case they can write off the bling-bling as a business expense). We tried to do it with McDonalds' and Disney but the wackos still manage to complain while munching Royales avec fromage. Then they send their best guys here, their local TV stations get to fly here and cover the games, expense accounts are padded and everyone's h
