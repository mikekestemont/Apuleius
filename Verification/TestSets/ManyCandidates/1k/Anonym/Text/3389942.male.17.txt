would complain.  Anyway,  Susan,  if you like,  our conversation, is as faint as a sound in my  memory,  as those fingernails scratching on my hull. ------------------------------------------------------------------
Guh,  My job isn't that bad, but sometimes it can suck.  It all depends.  Anyway, I have Sarah coming over tomorrow, so its all good.  --Grant.
Alright,  I was in Physics class, and after the teacher finished the lesson, I sat back and started thinking.  I got this... somthing hit me. Not physically, no, an idea, or rahter, a path...  I don't know where it came from. I've wanted to be a programmer since I was 8 years old; i've been programming since I was 8 years old... but... While thinking about what I like to do, the aspects of my Job I enjoy, what I like to do while programming... I think I was _made_ to sell cars.  My brother Rob went through 4 years of Electrical Engineering at Queens University, and he now works at Ottawa Hydro; sure, he does random electrical engineering things, but want to know what the favourite part of his job is? Organizing meetings, networking with people, organzing and assigning people to do stuff; and he's good at it. enough so, thats pretty much what he does now... Thats what he would be doing as a car salesmen.  I really like working with computers, but all the mystery and appeal of working with them is gone; coding seems dry to me... but at my Job at the independant, i'm constantly talking to people; people who come through my cash usually come through again. I know a university professer, a women who owns her own construction company, a women who wants me to tutor her son programming... all these people who know me; even though I'm just a cashier at a grocery store.  I think I would really enjoy being a car salesmen. I think its what i'm built to do. And on top of that, the pay would be amazing, and I'd get tons of time off to persue other intrests [such as programming].  I scheduled a guidence appointment, and i'm going to talk to my dad about it, but yeah... nuts.
Alright,  So I've got the programming competition coming up on the 29th. That should be intresting.  But what i'm more looking forward to right now is the party i'm having after the compition. I'm having about 18 people over, its going to be pretty awesome.  anyway, --Grant

Alright,  Yesterday was monday. The drop dead due date for my anthro sumamtive was today. I didn't quite finish it... I just handed in what I finished on sunday.  On a topic totally unrelated to me not finishing my anthro summative, I had Sarah over yesterday. ^^'. It was fun, we watched tons of south park [all season 8].  ummm... My physics summative is due Friday, my Programming summative is due Friday, my Computer Engineering summative is... tomorrow, its a test.  umm...  I work tonight, for 3 hours [yay for $21!], I shouldn't complain, I need the money.  anyway, -
