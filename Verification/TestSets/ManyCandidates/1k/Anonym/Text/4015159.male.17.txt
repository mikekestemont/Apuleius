part of my task accomplished, the only part I could control, for the other part I could not, Lane 6 was my enemy...          The appropriately named Marshmallow Kimberley Anne Stirling seemed to be doing rather well, much to my taunts and boos. She was doing so well in fact it seemed that there was no way I could stop her victory. Anyway, after all was said and done Kim had beat me, BY 4 FUCKING POINTS!!! I was devestated, she'd only gone bowling the night before and got a pretty dim 50ish! I mean come on people, she had to be cheating. They had bumpers which kinda peed me off because if they didn't I would've pwned her ass. But I accept my defeat, and so the third fail occurred.          For those of you who are slightly interested here is the list of people and points (in order):          13: Daz, 38 points.     12: Fish, 39 points.     11: Drew, 68 points.     10: Hopper, 70 points.     9: Gemma, 75 points.     8: Anne-Marie, 78 points.     7: Jayne, 80 points.     6: Andy D, 83 points.     5: Phil, 84 points.     4: Becky, 85 points.     3: Steve, 99 points.     2: James (ME), 113 points.     1: Kim (BITCH), 117 points.          Love ya really kim :D          Anyways as you can see I OWNED all the other people, just seems I couldn't own kim      :(. Tomorrows task will be up tomorrow!
I've decided upon tomorrow's task people. This is something I've wanted to do for ages but usually don't manage to do it. I've done it once or twice but tomorrow will be the only time that counts... Here it is.          The Seventh Task          Tomorrow my task will to be the top at bowling. I must win everyone else there. I usually come 2nd/3rd but have only ever come 1st a few times (And that was only an arcade bowling alley). HOPEFULLY I'm taking my camera (if i remember) so I may post some piccies on here, should be a good night. WISH ME LUCK :D
The Recipe          Half a bottle of Yazoo Chocolate Milkshake     Cocopops     Milk     5 Tablespoons of virgin cola     2 tablespoons of vimto dilute     8 tablespoons of water     4 tablespoons of Oasis (Orange)          (Feel free to make it yourself and try it)          The Result          Well, there's the recipe and I can reveal that I will not pass the task. I have failed. It smelt like something able to injure a human, it tasted like something that would be used to kill rats! It was a random concoction and I didn't cheat by making a different one when I knew I couldn't do it. Sorry folks, thats 2 fails now :(. It looked like choccie milkshake.
The Sixth Task          Well people I've decided that for my sixth task I will be making a concoction (a drink with loads of crap in it, and consuming it, I will be getting a witness in the form of an MSN buddy over my webcam). This task will be passed, or failed depending on whether I can drink at least 50% of the entire t
