Summer. Not only that, if Ali can indeed make it over here this Summer, I have no way of meeting up with her without telling my parents about her. ...they don't even like me talking to people on MSN or AIM, let alone meeting girls I met online who I might possibly have sex with. They'll kill me. X_X
Sigh..I'm not having much fun, hehe. I wanted to see that Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban movie, but I have no money and had to watch my annoying lil brothers, so no go. Kyray kept going on about how it sucked and how the Dementors looked like umbrellas...XD. But whatever. I'll see it eventually. My fangirlishness depends on it. XD  On another note, I really miss Ali. I haven't been able to talk to her since yesterday night, and she's the only thing I've been thinking about all day..either I'm worrying about what's happening with her, or I'm thinking of all the romantic things I want to do with her...either way, I couldn't get her out of my mind. Mary suggests that I may indeed be in love with Ali...hmm..only time will tell on this case.

I don't know what is wrong with this site and my computer..haven't been able to create a new post in days. Well, whatever. ^^"  I *love* my new hair. Those pictures I posted at FC can't do justice to it.  It really looks that awesome. When I looked in the mirror, I for once actually liked seeing my reflection. I can tell I'm going to be a picture whore when I get my digital camera, hehe.   In unrelated news, my feelings for Sana have been lessening and my affection for Steph has been increasing, which is really, really good. I've recently started having dreams about Steph, so I know where my affection lies. ^^"
Wow, been so long since I've posted in this thing...crazy, hahahahaha. Well, since I'm bored, I may as well do a run down on my thoughts.  Ahh...school begins September 2nd. I dunno whether to be excited or downright nervous. I moved from such a small lil Christian private school (which started with only 3 students XD), all the way up to I think the biggest high school in my city. More than 1500 students. @_@ I'm going to dread having to go up to the board to solve a math equation I don't get, especially since I'll be looking like an idiot in front of so  many people. Gaaaaaaaaah. -_-  Let's see...Summerslam is coming from the Air Canada Centre (I think that's the arena) in Toronto, Canada, and is only a couple short weeks away. Yay. I'm looking forward to the Randy Orton - Chris Benoit match for Benoit's World title. I'm pretty sure Orton will come out on top and become the youngest World champion in the titles's illustrious history. :D  Hmm...things are going really, really well with me and Marcelle. We're in love, hehe. And our one month anniversary will be on August 18th. :O :O :
