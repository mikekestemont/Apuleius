after the intense "eye" report, they go immediately to the guy who went to one of the areas where the storm  could  have hit, but didn't.  He's bone dry, and usually it's sunny, or maybe just a little cloudy.  "Pretty calm here," he says, not missing a beat.  "Looks like we got lucky this time.  Back to you."  It's the same thing every time.  And it's awesome.    While the coverage of hurricane Charley does not rival the 21 day snack-fest of coverage that I went through during the DC sniper ordeal, it's as good as it gets when there is no other news.  Plus, this time some super intense reporter,  urlLink Jim Cantore , was telling people to get out of their homes and to higher ground.  He said, "I hope you heard me, because I'm serious.  Get to higher ground; you've got two hours, tops."  He sounded like a professional wrestler calling out an opponent.  To him, perhaps he is.  And his only opponent is Charley, all that is evil.    The coverage is made at least a little bit better because I'm in the middle of a feederband right now, watching my weather map in motion, trying to figure out just how bad it's going to get.    My buddy Ryan has to deliver pizzas tonight.  Gainesville is expecting at least 6 inches of rain, sustained winds of at least 50 MPH, gusts up to 90 MPH, with a tornado watch and flood warnings until at least 2 AM.  But Five Star Pizza is open for business.  Sucks for Ryan, but when I get hungry, I think I'll order one.    **UPDATE**  It's 8:30 now, and no sign of any intense rain.  Bumout.  But the pizza was awesome.
I am now officially a part of Team Martinez.  In other words, I am backing, and working for,  urlLink Mel Martinez  in the Republican primary for the open Senate seat here in Florida.    For those who don't know, Mel's story is an inspiring manifestation of the American Dream.  I am supporting Martinez because I trust that he will fight for lower taxes and smaller government, a stronger military, and a secure homeland.    The other candidates in the primary are qualified and would, no doubt, make excellent Senators.  However, Martinez represents our best chance of sending a Republican to Washington, and electability has its place in politics.    And given the  urlLink buffoon who currently calls himself our Senator , we sure could use some good old fashioned GOP relief right about now.  If you are interested in helping to send a conservative to the Senate, let me know and we'll get you involved immediately.
I've been remiss in my blogging.  But it's for a few good reasons.  First, I can be remiss right now because no one is reading this.  Secondly, I've been hard at work on my research projects, and playing Hold 'Em at  urlLink partypoker.com .    Expect more regular blogging soon enough.  Until then, go read  urlLink this book , and come back smarter.  Then go listen to  urlLink this , and come back c
