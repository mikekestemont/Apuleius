Matthew's camera, haven't developed the film yet, will post them up after their ready.  So anyway, we decided that since it was so hot in the gowns, we shall just take in chjimes in the gown, then we go take photos in our normal clothes at the esplanade. I mean..imagine if we walk all the way from chjimes to esplanade in our gowns, with tripod and all that? And its too troublesome to take off and put on again.  Singapore's cityscape actually not bad hor     This lion is so funky! haha      Different angles of the "durian"     I think this is a really nice angle     A bit dark, but the trees are really quite cute      Sunset     Alright, time to zzz.. gotta work tomorrow.. how i wish i was on leave the whole week like Karen
Fridays i always no mood to work, spent most of the afternoon surfing the net for ticket prices, hot air balloon companies, and bridgeclimb price.. everything so ex wor! Somemore i travelling alone, ticket more ex, coz most promos are for min 2 travellers. Anyone going to Sydney end year??? But then, my colleague's sister works in a travel agency, so he's helping me to see if got any promotions, so hopefully, i can get a ticket for less than $800. Royal Brunei is $760 incl taxes and surcharges BUT minimum 2 ppl, you say sian or not?! But i so long never go for a real long holiday that im really quite excited preparing and planning for the trip haha!  My colleagues are all so nice, i always get free meals and drinks til i really quite paisay. We went to Villag'e during lunch and coz OCBC credit cards got 15%, my colleague signed first, then she say don't need to pay her back. Then at night we went to this place to see some salsa dancing and my other colleague bought quite a few tequila shots for me. I think next week i really must treat them lunch. Better do so now while i still have some money, otherwise mid month will be broke again.  I'm  still  sick.. not sure if the tequilas made my cough worse, but i woke up in the middle of the night, or morning..645am to be precise, coughing and coughing non stop for at least an hour. It was so horrrible, the minute i stopped coughing i could feel another cough coming up. On the bright side, my eyes seem to be getting better. The infection started on Tues, so its Saturday now.. hopefully on Mon will be 100% recovered and i can wear my contacts, or at least not red or swollen can already. Mon take leave go take photos! hee  So anyway, supposed to go for dim sum lunch with my mom, aunties and baby laeticia, but somehow, my mom was busy and we didn't go. I can sleep longer, woke up at 3pm, just nice to bathe and change go meet podders at Cartel PS. Shall leave you with some photos of the gathering.. need to zzzz.. n
