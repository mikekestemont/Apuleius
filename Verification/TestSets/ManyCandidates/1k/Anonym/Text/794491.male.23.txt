THE PATRIOT, BERKELEY/CALIFORNIA GOP   Back in August 2003, former  Patriot  writer and CalStuff proprietor Kevin Deenihan  urlLink commented  on a Sex On Tuesday column on "sex positivity" (written by a friend of mine, actually).  Said Kevin: The fact of the matter is that Berkeley is already as sexually liberated as it can be-- intellectually. What's holding us back is biological or emotional. I don't know that a sex column about intellectual and linguistic inhibition can do much about this. Well, apparently  urlLink not much .  From the Daily Cal: Just two days after Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger dubbed California Democratic legislators "girlie men," California College Republicans are taking his message to the street.  Republican students all over the state are wearing and selling hundreds of T-shirts reading "Don’t be a Girlie Man" to rouse Republican support against what they say are special interests at play in the state’s stalled budget.   "The new apparel is part of a larger effort among College Republicans to help elect Republicans in vulnerable State Senate and Assembly seats currently held by Democrats," said Michael Davidson, state chairman of the California College Republicans in a statement. Hmm.  A well-meaning Berkeley liberal chimes in indignantly: "It uses 'girl' as a derogatory term. What’s wrong with being a girl?" said Pamela Bachilla, president of the Cal Berkeley Democrats. "I think it’s ridiculous that they think its [sic] a joke, but it doesn’t really bother me that they demonstrate how insensitive they are." Ok, of course she's right that there's nothing wrong with being a girl, but the bigger problem with the shirts is that they attack girlie-ness, femininity in general, particularly in men (The Queer Resource Center rep quoted in the article right after Pamela gets it).  That they refer to a 17-year-old skit is not an excuse.  And what does  Patriot  editor and  urlLink vigorous campaigner  Amaury Gallais think of all this? Amaury Gallais, managing editor of California Patriot, UC Berkeley’s conservative magazine, said when Democratic legislators behave "as little kids when they are elected officials, the 'girlie man' comments could not be more appropriate." So being a male with prominent feminine qualities is tantamount to being childish.  Glad to have you on record!  Coming from a  urlLink creationist   urlLink VCM member , of course.  But of course, flip-flopper that he is, Gallais follows that up with some boyish excitement: "I think everyone will be excited about it," Gallais said. "I found the idea awesome—I can’t wait to get the shirts." Regardless, CPW strongly endorses the sale of these shirts.  If the California College Republicans and their allies at the  Patriot  intend to spread the belief that only men serve (or should serve?) in the State Capitol, who am I to stop them?  By all means, embrace that position, Republicans!  (And by the way, there's essentially been agreement on the budget for a while now, the sticking point is that Schwarzy doesn't want to pass it until the Dems agree to support two un-related  urlLink anti-labor measures , thereby pleasing the Guv's own -- gasp! -- special interest b
