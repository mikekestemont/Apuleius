present, that will lead you that future. So, In my own observation and thoughts, I have come to believe that these 2 cannot be separated. Because the former is an onset of the latter. Fate cannot exist without faith. People from different schools of thought may differ, but to me what’s important is that we have faith in something. Faith in our future, faith in our family, faith in someone…anything and maybe even blind faith, the faith of GOD. Only when we can start to have faith, can we truly appreciate our fate.  No one knows what God has planned for us. But what we do know, is living each day to the best of our ability and our hearts. Of coz it would be nice to have that special someone around... But it's God's plan, we can only ask for his guidance and help, and as we all know, it will take faith. Because, like what a close friend told me long ago...faith is believing in what you cannot see, the reward of faith, is seeing what you believe. And I believed him.  The lives of many differ. But what has given the weak strength, is their faith, and who are those who have lost their own feet... allowing their blooming pessimism to grow?....those who have lost faith in themselves and the people around them. And that is why they do not appreciate the things that were given to them, and that is why these things were taken away. There is a reason why events occur or accidents happen…or your dog ate your winning toto ticket… or your beloved boy/girl friend left you…or vice versa…even your overlooked promotion…or even your promotion….or you meeting that special someone…or you helping a complete stranger…well, what ever it is, God had allowed these things to happen, good or bad in your eyes, because he has allowed your faith to see you through something better or worst, and that you will eventually be fated for something greater.
