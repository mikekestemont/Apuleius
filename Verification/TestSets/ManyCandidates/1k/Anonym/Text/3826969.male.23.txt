their beloved. What started off as a slow dance for this multitude, transformed into a symbol of defiance against a world clouded with broken dreams and vanished hopes. In the wake of the chorus, we became champions of truth, love and beauty. Men and women held onto to each tightly, desperately-for all knew the song’s climax would probably usher in many of life’s bitter realities. For a few brief moments Eric managed to gravitate a greater sense of transcendence into the lives of his audience. And we loved him for that. We worshipped him for that.   A natural high is the fastest of deaths. My ticket stub will probably be forgotten in a laundry pile only to be resurrected to a collection of other ticket stubs. Eventually, tonight will become a scrapbook memory, and all the visceral images and sounds will fade in the twilight of my mind. And I will hopefully become haunted again by the sounds produced by the likes of Carlos Santana, Neil Young or Pearl Jam. They too will foster this awakening of dread and wonder.     Will it ever die, this need to challenge those that have conquered the masses with their talents and passions? Will I be satisfied with myself once I have taken my stage, and am commanding beauty into the lives of others? Or will I be standing beneath a spotlight, wishing I was taking part in the dance below and wondering if transcendence was ever mine to bestow in the first place?    I’m not sure. But I do know that Clapton and his colleagues have earned this sort of reverence, not merely with talent, but through a tenacious desire marked by white knuckled perseverance In the deepest sense of meaning, each member of the audience had to come to terms with Clapton and his musical glory. It haunts every human being, this need to become fully manifested through the mandate of our Original Design. Clapton can draw such captivating brilliance from an audience, in large part because he exercises much of his natural, God-given design. And when we behold anything of true beauty it pierces us with both wonder and affliction; an eternal paradox reminding us of who we are not and who we should become. And for a moment, Clapton’s music allowed me to glimpse into the Person that any of us could become.
7.7.2004   Since, I've decided to not get initiated into the powerful Friendster mob family, I thought the next best thing was to go independent. Hopefully here, my thoughts and personality can roam a bit more, instead of having to live under the jurisdiction of a pyramid scheme website. And when I'm ready, I think I'll invite more than just 3 friends.  Speaking of, if you invite more than 3 people onto Friendster do you get something fancy like a trip to the Caribbean?  I really didn't want this to be a written protest against Friendster. I would have saved that objection for handcuffing myself to their corportate office. I guess this is what it means to m
