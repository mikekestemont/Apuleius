I hate zoos. THe whole idea of looking at enslaved animals within fake environments lost its appeal for me after Planet of the Apes -- the orignal one, not the crappy new one. This visit was even better than normal visits to the zoo because I got to see Asians frantically puttering about, shooting pictures with wild abandon. They were a lot funner (shut up. it's a word) to observe than the bears who, for the most part, boredly gazed at us with drunken expressions. It's still my contention that naming bears "Rosey" or whatever is incredibly dangerous in the way it humanizes wild animals that can easily crush your car into an aluminum can, but on the other hand, it sure is funny to hear Asians trying to pronounce Rosey while nodding in understanding at what must be, to them, cryptic remarks of the English-speaking tour guide.

urlLink    ...is that a mirage? &nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    The end is near!&nbsp; urlLink
