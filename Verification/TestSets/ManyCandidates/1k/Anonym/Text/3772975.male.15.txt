he was scared of donating his blood. ? .  Anyway I also got malas, so i skipped too. But I got dearly punished for playing truant. I got sick. I got a headache, sore throat, flu, you name it i probably had it. So the crosswords had to be left for tomorrow.  Wednesday...  Skipped Asiah. That was supposed to be good. Until I met one of the other guys in tuition outside. Crap .. wonder whats gonna happen to me next week.. Now the crosswords. We had 9 of them. And they passed it to me to pass to my mum so she could hantar the postcards. Slight problem. THEY WERE ALL BLANK!. ALL! MY STUPID "GROUP MEMBERS" DIDNT EVEN BOTHER TO DO ANYTHING!! NOT THE SLOGAN, NOT THE ANSWERS, NOT EVEN THEIR FREAKING PERSONAL DETAILS! Somemore i didnt have the clues to the puzzle, and it was night already.. i had to pass it to my mom the next morning! AND I'm sick.  But thats not all. I called Weng Yip, I called Roger, I called Wei Wei, I called Wenhan.. my supposed group members.  Weng Yip? He promised to call me when he thought of a slogan. Never got back to me. Roger? ROGER? THAT @#%% REJECTED MY CALL!! MY OWN "GROUP MEMBERS" REJECTING MY CALL! KINDA MELAMPAU RIGHT? DAH LA TAK BUAT, BILA ORANG NAK TANYA DIA BUAT SLOGAN, DIA REJECT PULAK! AND YOU KNOW WHATS WORSE? HE FREAKING SWITCHED OFF HIS GOD DAMN PHONE!! TALK ABOUT HELPFULNESS!! HE IS A  $%@$@#!#!%@%#%#Q$@#@%#$~~!!!! Wei Wei? The stupid guy went out to play basketball. Dah la tak ajak, tak buat pun crossword. Wenhan was the only person that helped me. But the both of us couldnt do it alone.  Thursday.. I was supposed to pass the puzzles to my mom in the morning before i went to school. I didnt. HOW COULD I? HOW IS 1 PERSON GOING TO FINISH 9 PUZZLES? 9 BLANK PUZZLES? WITHOUT THE CLUES? I really got fed up with those useless #$%^^. I just brought it to school, slammed the postcards in front of them and said "Look, I am fed up, I wont send. I dont want to do already" Then only they started to panic a LITTLE.. but not Weng Yip though. I think he wouldnt mind even if he got the freaking money.. he didnt give a crap about anything going on. And he expects a fair share of the money. If like that might as well give Terry a fair share also right? After all, they BOTH only  submitted their papers.. they didnt do anything more. Useless people.  Friday.. I didnt go to school again. Boring la... I managed to send the postcards through my uncle.. I only got the postcards at 11+ pm last night from Roger. Speaking of Roger.. he was at the police station last night. Wonder why? Ask him la. And now I'm typing this... This is really stupid. Im sick, I got stressed out AGAIN, I have to take 4 different kinds of pills, this s
