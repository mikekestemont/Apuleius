school is basically a giant vat of fresh testosterone and estrogen, everyone was too busy trying to stay afloat to actually be friends with anyone.  In fact, she even went as far, one time, as collaborating with uber-bitch Gretchen Lieb in one of her "let's be an uber-bitch" plans. It was a simple one, in which Jessica pretended to "have a crush on me. " I think I was supposed to fall for it, but I made the mistake of just writing on my return note 'Call me then.' I should have written 'You're full of it, but call me anyway.' Unfortunately, only writing "Call me then." meant that I fell for the joke. Bugger.  Anyway, by the end of 8th grade, we'd re-forged a true friendship. Soon after, we called each other "Best friends." This was new to me, since, despite the fun we had together in elementary school, I was frequently informed that I could not possibly be her best friend, because Nellie Bradford was her best friend. But she said it was ok if she was my best friend. Greedy bitch.  There are so many stories, which I will probably attempt to recount one-by-one, as I've been meaning to do for a while. When you get old, memories start to get hazy! Hopefully Jessica will drop by and leave some additional stories in the form of comments!  I think I had a point with all of this, but I've since forgotten it. But it was fun, anyway.
So, here I am, two years into a graduate program at the University of California, Davis. I haven't been TERRIBLY productive during those two years, although I have managed to get almost all of my class requirements finish (I have one more), and to pass the preliminary exams (it was my second try, but I got a clear pass!)  Anyway, I haven't really seemed to figure out how to enjoy research. It basically involves reading lots of dry papers, thinking about what people have already done, trying to do something new, and then writing new, dry papers about it. It sounds pretty lucrative, except for the "dry" part.  My guess is that the real problem is that I can't manage to get myself to do something if I don't enjoy it. Which basically means I'm going to have big trouble when I get a real job.  I'm going to say that a major problem is one of focus. I tend to become bored with whatever I'm doing within a period of a few weeks or months. So, I'm going to have to find a career that won't allow me to get bored. Some of you might suggest, say, teaching. "Oh, teaching is great, it's new every 4 months!" Ok, no. It's still teaching. You still write lesson plans, grade papers, and try to convince morons that they're not stupid.  So, what will I do? Will I stay in the PhD program? Will I get a Master's and move to Raleigh with Rob? This all remains to be seen. Tune in next t
