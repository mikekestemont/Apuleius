most amazing things I’ve seen.  It looked as if every window in every building was twinkling, like the person inside that room kept flicking the lights on and off, on and off.  Really, the whole city was like that.  We flew over the heart of Vancouver and towards Surrey, then back towards Victoria.    On the way back to Victoria, my dad had called my mom on his cell phone, to go out in the backyard when he said, and use his super flash light to see if we could see it from up there.  So when the time came, we saw Tillicum mall and counted the number of streets until ours, and surely enough, we saw the light blinking at us.  It was the weirdest sight, to see something so far down to the earth, from something so high above the earth.  We then flew over downtown, where we saw the Empress Hotel and the Legislative Building.  We flew over to where the cruise-liners dock, and surprisingly there were three there.

We packed up our stuff, checked to see if the plane was ready for the next user, and headed on back home.  It was convenient that we all live in the same three rows of houses, so we didn’t really have to drop anyone off.  We all went our separate ways, thus ending the night of flying, and new memories, to last us a lifetime.   -----------  I wrote this a few minutes after I got back from going out flying with Daryl my dad and Lee.
