time has given me a chance to think. I really need to find work that is better suited for me. Where I can be creative and use all of the edu-ma-cation I have earned.  More alone time with the boy, more play, more exploring, more just enjoying our love. It will be hard to part again after this week. One of the suckiest things about a long distance relationship ...  I am going to apply with purpose to all jobs that I want. Whether at home or in TO. I need to break free from this cycle. And with the new school semester I think its time to just jump in head first. Pissed off though. My course is barely part time which means I will have to start paying back OSAP unless I take a few extra courses elsewhere. A good thought but still have to crunch the numbers. Also have to wait till the end of the month to discover if I really do need to seriously find a new job too .... who knows if my contract will be re-newed, and if I even want to stay.    Note to self: buy the boy a toy and use it on him.
Finally a full day alone with the boy. Time to enjoy each other. Now I know my new favourite form of exercise :-D Thank gwad the boy enjoys exploring, and dress up and toys...      Dog has finally decided that yes, she can pee and poop in a strange neighborhood.      Had New Gen Sushi for lunch. If in TO you must go (  urlLink  http://www.newgeneration.7h.com/   ), the Crunch Maki set is very yummy. Wish I had millions of dollars to forever eat sushi, drink expensive coffee and buy pretty pink sparkly things.      Musn't forget went to Urban store, wanted to get new binder for studies. Will not in my right mind pay $22 for a binder - even if it is pink and has the Paul Frank monkey on it- except of course unless it write my thesis paper for me. However, I did get a sweet purse. Oh my I am turning into a girlie girl!
Day #2 - OK off to the cottage we head! Sure its Sunday just before noon - who is going to be on the roads now?  Apparently half of the freekin' GTA.  It took  3.5 hours  to get from Canada's Wonderland to just out side of Barrie. Wooo hooo! Let the good times roll! Finally get to cottage, sigh of relief.   Remember to look up Christadelphians.       Day #3 - Sun, sand and sleep. Dog apparently does not understand the concept of the boat and does splits trying to board. Ahhh so nice, but can't wait to get back to the Big City to spend some 'quality time' with the boy *wink*.      Day #4 - Head back to the city. Thankfully traffic has subsided. Note to self: get diaper for future road trips as a spastic bladder is not pleasant to deal with!  Looked up Christadelphians:  urlLink http://www.christadelphian.org.uk/ .  Sure, whatever makes your boat f
