hottest and for those that go to school (like me) they have to get ready to go back. I've got the added bonus (HA!) of moving about 900 miles about two weeks from now to Houston which is even hotter (I'm so glad it's August) than St. Louis. I did get accepted to  urlLink University of Houston - Downtown  though, so I don't have to worry any more about what I'm going to do this fall. I'm planning on going to Houston for a few days either later this week or early next week so I can register for classes. I don't start until August 23rd (almost September by then) so I've got a week of living in my dad's three room apartment or trying to figure out some place else to chill out of town for a few days so I don't go crazy having to be so close to my family. Anybody want to house and feed me for a couple of days with no chance of receiving money for your services?  urlLink Still haven't gotten that fucking bumper fixed... DAMMIT!

I had actually gone to Enterprise to see if I could get the car before I had to turn in my Altime on Sunday, but they were closed. While I was there with my brother I happened to see a similar Jaguar sitting in a spot and I jokingly said to Keegan that I wanted that one. I think the only difference between the two is the color. As the papers were being signed the Enterprise employee was practically begging me to take the $15 dollar a day insurance coverage in case of an accident, but I passed 'cause I'm a badass driver and the only time my car gets dinged is when it's parked and some other jackass decides to hit it.I'm probably going to have to return it Friday, when the trusty Kosmobile is supposed to be returned to me, but I'm going to enjoy it while I can. I've been getting some funny looks from people as I cruise by. I bet they think I'm somebody important. Those f
