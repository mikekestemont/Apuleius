other than removing the Taliban.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sure Osama and his merry band of Mad Bombers were there, but we still haven't  gotten them.&nbsp; We did make them less effective, but they're still alive and  3,000 americans are still dead.&nbsp;    Iraq became the next target on our list of Terrorist States.&nbsp; We spent  12 years trying to ensure that Saddam was disarmed, and we failed.&nbsp; We  threatened force over &amp; over again, but never did anything more than a  bombing raid or lob a few cruise missiles.&nbsp; GWBush went to the UN and said  "Enough already, we've been attacked by one group already, and Iraq's been  threatening us for over a decade.&nbsp; Resolution after resolution, we tried to  get him to disarm and agree to inspectors and Saddam refused to comply, even  though he lost the war back in 1992.&nbsp; It's time for us to pay back our  promises in full.&nbsp; Are you with us?"&nbsp; The UN said No.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp;  Why not.&nbsp; No one in the UN really ever liked us except the Brits, and only  because we've saved their asses so many times it ain't funny.&nbsp; The French  are in the same boat, but they'd been turning more and more Anti-US since  Charles DeGalle.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Germans we'd beaten into submission 50 years  ago, and I don't think they've forgotten it, so they obviously don't want us  exerting any more power.&nbsp;&nbsp; And the Russians, well, c'mon&nbsp;you can  take away the Soviet titles, but they're the same old commies, only now they're  broke.&nbsp;&nbsp;    So we went to war with Iraq in hopes of finally ending the Greek Tragedy  that it has become over the years.&nbsp; The Iraqi government fell within weeks,  Saddam was caught a few months later.&nbsp; We've been rebuilding their  nation.&nbsp; Oh but what about all those soldiers that have died??&nbsp; What  about them???&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew you'd ask that, so here's my answer:&nbsp;  These brave soldiers, airmen, sailors, and Marines all joined up knowing that  there would be a possibility of laying down their lives in the service of their  Nation.&nbsp; Every recruiter tells you to go home and think about that before  you sign anything.&nbsp; Remember, this is their job.&nbsp; They've spent weeks,  months, and/or years of training to go to war for a reason: war  happens.&nbsp;&nbsp;    Another thing you lefties start talking about is all those innocent  civilians that George Bush, Dick Cheney, and Haliburton have killed.&nbsp; 20,  30, 40 thousand innocent people killed for oil.&nbsp; Bullshit.&nbsp; More than  half of the civilians who've died in Iraq&nbsp;are killed by their fellow  Iraqis.&nbsp; Suicide attacks, truck bombs, roadside bombs, mines, mortar fire,  all of these things are aimed at the US, but hit civilians as well.&nbsp; If you  read the reports of US soldiers dying or wounded, they go something like this:  "2 US servicemen killed, 14 wounded in action near Najaf, 34 civilians killed,  over 200 wounded in same truck bombing"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess you can blame  GWBush for those deaths, because if it werent for him, the Iraqi "freedom  fighters" wouldn't be fighting against the US Oppressors and Occupiers.   &
