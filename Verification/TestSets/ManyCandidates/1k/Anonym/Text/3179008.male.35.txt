first Monday of the rest of my life. And it is the first of two before I leave on vacaction.   Todays goings on:  * One student is not here ( window breaker ). She may not return, even just a week since we were told to dig in with her. Which was a couple of months after they told us she would be leaving anyday. And so it goes  * Another student is not here ( sleeper ). He wasn't here on Friday either, rarely is. His mother lets him stay home. He has her rapped around his finger. She is to passive with him and his brother.  * We got a new student a couple days ago. She is very much like another student that we have had for three years. That is not good, er, ... it is challenging, the behaviors she presents. A sixteen year old girl with a five year old mentality. She is very vocal, and has poor boundaries with peers...gets into others business frequently.  Gotta go... taking thursday off,...helping to prevent burn out moment by moment.
What a great weekend. Three wonderful days. I was able to neglect thinking about work for about 95% of the time. I did many physical and natural things. 4X4 ing up in the mountains... discovered a sweeet water hole. I'll be there again.  Now to the fun.  Last week, on Friday, one of the students in my class broke the window of the teacher in the other class ( more on her blog...maybe ). Anyway, that class was able to leave early for their outing. A positive way to look at being scared shitless fromm a dual-paned window being smashed into their room when they were quietly doing art-type work. It appears that the house in which the window-breaker lives neglected to give her her medication in the morning. Considering she is bipolar, and schizo a bit, that was not good. The straw that broke her back was seeing a return student, boy, that she had a crush on. Her head must have been a blender of thoughts and feelings.   Anyway, break time. More tomorrow, maybe.  D
It has been a while. I had a break for a week. Loved it. Now I am back doing a Day Treatment component of our school. We do a lot of social skills building and recreational challenges. Today we took the kids out on a lake to canoe. Wow, what a challenge for the staff and kids. We have quite a few kids with us for this part that we the staff don't know. That is not cool. Some of them are just being "baby sat " by us. We are not being monetarily compensated for the services provided. We are doing favors for foster parents, providing respit. Whatever, I am feeling good about having had vacation, and the possibility of having a new position next year.  Maybe salary, and a raise. I do know that I will be in a different class next year, with the older kids. Right on!  Peace Out, D
