...will be the first ever blog post by me.  This is Nurse Kelly speaking. I am 36 years old, married with children.  My husband is Jeff and he a great husband, a terrific father, (I hope he reads this lol) and the custodian at Calvary Baptist Church.  We have been married for 15 years.  Matthew is our 13 year baby boy that enjoys baseball, paintball, playing his guitar, being online talking to msn friends and just having fun.  Erin is our 10 year old baby girl.  She enjoys being on the go all the time.  As far as activities she plays fast pitch softball, basketball, and cheerleading.   We make up the Harperhome along with our rat terrior, Rocky.  He was born Sept. 11, 2001.   We have all made professions of faith and have been saved by the precious blood of Jesus and are looking foward to our eternity in heaven.....striving daily to be Christ-like in everything we do, trying to let the light of Jesus shine.            I am a registered nurse and work at a long term care facility with the position of staff development.  Basically, what that means is that I teach nurse aide classes, educate staff with in services, employee health, and other duties that will just bore you. For the most part, I do enjoy my work.  I just get tired of the long hours and want to be home with my family all the time but that just isn't an option at this point in our lives.  I LOVE being a mom.  We have lived at the ball park this summer but it has been wonderful.   I have lots to say but my friend, Stu is wanting me to hurry up and post so he can see if I have done everything right.  Oh yea, a very special thanks to "Stu" for introducing me to blog.  Thanks Stu.   So til we meet again,  Huggz.
Amazing!! What a wonderful service of cleansing and worship the Lord allowed us to have.  We as a "church body" were obedient to His precious will and presence.              All I have on my heart is:              Amazing Love how can it be? That you my King would die for me.  Amazing Love I know it's true..it's my joy to honor you...in all I do...I honor y
