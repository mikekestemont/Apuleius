It was the Musical,  the best show in the world, its the musical... i'm never gona do a thing like this again  Opening night, i walk out on stage, the lights shine down, bright in my eyes. now i'm staring out, into the crowd. waiting for my que to move... ... closing night, we had a blast, it's all over, over at last. i made so many friends, and i hope to see them all again!  in next years Musical,  the best show in the world, its the musical... maybe i'll do a thing like this again (Musical, Mike Splain)
well it's been along time since my last update... last week sucked.. alot of stuff but clases are now over.   Friday: First review day, in gym we played hockey which was awsome. Pat, trying to do a slapshot, missed and hit my leg with the stick, breaking it in half. It really didn't hurt much but it was funny.  Sat and sun were filled with studying for exams and sun we had the gloria concert. It sounded great.   Today we had our first exam, Math, and i think it went well. Afterwards we went to the frosh awards cerimony. My dad gave out some fathers club awards cus he's the 9th grade representitive dad.. or watever it is.... Later near the end, i got a special award for Music. The teachers vote on the kids with the highest GPA in that class and choose who they think worked the hardest and they like the most. I was really suprised. Afterwards my mom, dad, and i went to unos for some food. Then we came home and i studied for awhile then i went for a bike ride... i went for awhile, about 5 miles through the park and the pathways.   Now i'm off to studying for this impossible Spanish exam tomorrow... i'm so excited...
