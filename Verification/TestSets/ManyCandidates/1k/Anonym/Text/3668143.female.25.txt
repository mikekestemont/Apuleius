time together, aside from your skills! Hihihi :D)      Phone sex  (not!) -- I remember those many, many, many times (daily?) that I have to call her - she should have charged me $1.50 per minute, that way she doesn't have to work anymore!!! My fondest memories would be singing with her on the phone (yup, she's a closet singer too) til 3 or 5 am (and then the next day my throat hurts), and probably "sleeping on" her -- that is, on the phone, either 丽婷 or I would fall asleep because we were soooo stupid we're both sleepy and would not put down the phone.   Night visits  -- There were those times when 哥哥就就 and I would visit her at her home at night and we'd spend a few hours chatting on one of the cafe's in Tomas Morato. 哥哥就就 was very fond of her, and its good that her mom likes 哥哥就就 and even considers him a handsome guy (haha!). I'm always very happy being with my 2 favorite people then.   Overnighters  -- Her mom probably wonders from time to time whether her daughter is gay because I would spend occassional overnight stays at her house (well her parents would not let her sleep at our house anyway)! And I give flowers during Valentines' Day, or even during birthdays? (Did i?)   Hippiest times  -- shopping at Mango, and eating (or rather piging) out! That was during the time when we were still getting $$ from our former American boss M.S.   Naughtiest times  -- Singapore (hihihi) where the underground clubs are soooooooo great and where pink vodka is sooooooooo delicious that she sipped the pink vodka straight for 20 seconds and boom -- she got tipsy she needed to hold the table to be able to stand stright.  Hey that night was the bomb we were really able to wear the skimpy tops that we bought! And I remember I also "went down" on Richard- on the dance floor that is. (Oh sh*t, I just remembered something, Ludy went with us back to the Hotel and spent the night there! Now I feel bad not sleeping with her LOL, I just realize I could have been more sensitive...dannnggg. Obviously she could go back to her apartment anytime even at wee hours... eeek my imagination running wild again)     ===  P.S. I have to continue this again some other time, or else I'd write and write and write until morning!
Happy 16th monthsary, sweetie pie!  Congratulations for NOT giving up on me in 16 months ;p (yup I am still in a bitter-sarcastic mood, sorry) If we were really together and had irresponsible but  reproductive  sex on our 6th month, we would have a one-month old baby by now hihihi, whoever the mommy will be.  So where are you? I haven't heard from you since... yesterday! It is odd, sometimes I feel like its been so long already that I last heard from you, but in reality its only been like 24 hours or so... I am probably just getting older.  Aimeishu. A
