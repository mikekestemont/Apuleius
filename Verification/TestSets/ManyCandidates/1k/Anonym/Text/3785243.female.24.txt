Today's Biscuit of the Day is  urlLink  A Dog's Tale   by Mark Twain.  The full collection of short stories can be found  urlLink here.   Urgh, it's been a busy week.  I'm just about done with finals for the summer semester!  Saw a beautiful Italian movie this week,  urlLink  Il Postino  .  It was pleasantly bittersweet, and the landscape of rural Italy was breathtaking.  The lead actor, Massimo Troisi, literally gave his life to make the movie, as he passed away 12 hours from severe heart disease after all the shooting was done.  He knew he needed treatment for his heart, but refused to go to the hospital, as he felt the movie was more important.    --  Aeryth
Today's Biscuit of the Day features a small company called  urlLink Frog Design .  Any of you in the audience who use the Dell website, who use Windows XP, or like the bleeps, bloops and beeps in OS 9 and OS X have these people to thank.  It's interesting to see how MS and Dell went after this company to do their design after Frog did work with OS 9.  Monkey see, monkey do?  ;)  -- Aeryth
Here's a neat quiz showing you what element you are.  It's actually pretty fitting for me.  [Image omitted by Blogger]   Your Element is Night. You're a loner who is very creative but never show your work to anyone. You may smile a little but sadness or loneliness surround you and other can feel it when they're near you. You have a dark or unusual beauty that makes you mysterious and you probably have a lot of secrets that you've never told anyone. You're beauty is intriguing and unorthodox but the real thing that makes you special is your eyes. Something in them makes them like Diamonds in the Rough.    urlLink   What's Your Element (girls)?

Today's Biscuit of the Day is a website by a British man who is transplanted into the lush landscape of southern Spain.  He rents out vacation houses to travelers seeking a respite from the busy world.  He has a wonderful photo gallery of a Spanish gypsy betrothal, as can be seen  urlLink here .  At the bottom is a photo gallery showing how olives are harvested and transformed into the yummy goodness that is olive oil.  I've been extremely busy and haven't had much time to prepare dinner.  So I've been busy buying crusty Italian and French bread and putting  urlLink Lucini's olive oil  on it.  To make it really good, you can crack fresh peppercorns over it, although the Lucini's is high enough quality and has a bite of its own that that's not really necessary.    -- Aeryth
Today's Biscuit of the Day is  urlLink  The Happy Prince  , by Oscar Wilde.  Many thanks to  urlLink Short Stories  for hosting this nice collection of Oscar Wilde short stories.  This is one of my favorite tales I remember from being little.  Enjoy this with a nice stout Irish Breakfast tea in honor of Wilde's Eire roots.  -- A
