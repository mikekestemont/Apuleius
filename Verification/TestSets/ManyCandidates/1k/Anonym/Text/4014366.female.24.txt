too much to talk about except for talking and complaining about the work, since i am out of the game already, i wasn't really participating anymore, my mind was somewhere else. in the end leng invited to her house next weekend, i said of course, but will i really go? don't know if u understand how i feel; well when we used to work together, we had the same enemy (the boss), and we fend the fort together, now that i have a new job, we are left with nothing else in common, so what is going to hold us together in the future? everytime i think of this i feel sad, but i guess that is how life goes.  however, i have another dinner arrangement with another group of co workers, heheheh, my popularity is just unstoppable!
forgot to mention something on the side..  u know when i first started using the internet 10 years ago, i signed up for this stupid lovematch web, after a few emails i never touched that site ever again. i have no idea how this guy managed to find my profile (perhaps after 1000 pages) and wrote me an email. this guy EMPHASIZED that he was a in the modeling business, and he provided me a link to see his picture..and EMPHASIZED that he was DISCOVERED, not applied..he emphasized it so much he even underlined the words "modeling" and "discovered". hahahhah. so what u r good looking? u r still a dumbass after all.
ray, wayne and anita were going to the jersey garden mall, and asked me if i wanted to tag along, actually they didn't need to ask, why would i ever say no to shopping?  the traffic was more than just slow, it PAUSED. this black car in front of us was so freaking slow which made the idling traffic even worse! one of the reasons why i never drive is because i'd be a furious driver; at one point i actually opened the door and tried to walk to front to tell that guy to move his fucking ass! but ray stopped me because i think my violence shocked the girl sitting in the back, well i forgot her name by now, but she is a tourist who came with anita. that girl asked anita:"does everyone in new york act like her?" no sweetie, if i were the direct representation of all new yorkers, new york would've been a warzone.  okay, the shopping part was rather normal, so i am gonna skip it and jump right to my next program...met up with keith, serena and lazybuddy, the usual crew for dinner, lots of chatting and shit talking, then we proceeded to the movie:the bourne supremacy...another matt damon's "not-only-i-am-cute-i-am-immortal" or "after-many-fights-still-no-scar-in-my-face" movies. a typical guyish movie i reckon; totally action packed, but with an uncomplicated story. i think i've complained wayyy too much tonite. anyway, it was a fun night, totally hung out with the right peeps!  just found out joy came back, greeeeaat! another person to hang with in my time o
