draft secret debate contracts called Memoranda of Understanding that dictate precisely how the debates will be run – from who gets to participate, to who will ask the questions, to the heights of the podiums. The CPD merely implements the directives of the contracts, shielding the major party candidates from public criticism. Walter Cronkite called the presidential debates an “unconscionable fraud” and accused the major party candidates of “sabotaging the electoral process.”Open Debates (www.OpenDebates.org), a ten-month old nonprofit organization, is engaged in a multifaceted, national campaign to reform the presidential debate process. In addition to aggressively exposing the antidemocratic practices of the CPD, Open Debates has formed a genuinely nonpartisan Citizens' Debate Commission to sponsor future presidential debates that address pressing national issues, feature innovative formats, and include the candidates that the American people want to see. Seventeen national civic leaders from the left, center and right of the political spectrum serve on the Citizens Debate Commission (www.CitizensDebate.org), and over sixty diverse civic organizations serve on the advisory board of the Citizens’ Debate Commission  Our campaign to reform the presidential debates is picking up steam:  On May 24, the Citizens Debate Commission announced sites and dates for five presidential and one vice-presidential debate to be held in colleges and universities around the country.

Read the Times editorial:  urlLink http://www.opendebates.org/news/relatedarticles/gloves.html  A new book exposing the corrupt presidential debate process has been released, “No Debate: How the Republican and Democratic Parties Secretly Control the Presidential Debates.” More info about the book is available at:  urlLink http://www.sevenstories.com/Book/index.cfm?GCOI=58322100234970  Open Debates filed legal complaints with the IRS and FEC against the CPD, relying on secret copies of the 1992 and 1996 Memoranda of Understanding obtained from a whistleblower. View the secret 1996 Memorandum of Understanding:  urlLink http://www.opendebates.org/documents/1996MemorandaOfUnderstanding.pdf     Now, President George W. Bush and Senator John Kerry must decide whether to participate in real and transparent presidential debates that maximize voter education, or stilted and deceptive bipartisan news conferences that maximize major party control. The Republican and Democratic nominees will only participate in debates proposed by the Citizens’ Debate Commission if the political benefit outweighs the political cost, and that calculus will only be achieved if sufficient voters demand democratic debates from them. Please help us exert that pressure; visit our website –  urlLink www.OpenDebates.org  – sign up for our infrequent Action Alerts, sign our petition, and make a financial contribution. With your help, we can restore voter education and transparency to the presidential debates.
