only possible through Him, He is God and we cant get to heaven by any other way! And we as the Children of God become offensive to the world as Jesus was because we believe and see Him, and we speak and live this message.  That is why the suffering comes to the Church, the Church that Live and breath the Gospel.  It was also interesting to hear that the western Church is in the minority, we are a privelaged few that are not being killed for our faith, where in other countrys people are being killed for their faith, daily. over 250,000 Christians are killed each year for their faith! But we in the west still have freedom...how long for? Who knows, and what will we do with that freedom?  I wonder if we are still asking the Lord for sight, so that we can see and know what we can do in these days of such change and intolarence towards Jesus and the Christian faith?  I had a great evening lastnight with my Girlfriend and some friends, I cooked a meal Spaghetti Carbonara (Is that the right spelling?) I cooked it from scratch, it tasted good... No one was sick, Praise the Lord. I was worried because you cook the sauce with 4 egges, raw, and they are supposed to cook by the heat of the pasta...it worked!  I am at work now, www.cornerstonevision.com, if you are interested. We are a design and publishing comp.  My Best friend Jon has a Blog too! We chatted about it, I am not sure why I am writing on this thing, perhaps it is just an outlet for my thoughts, even if no one reads it It will be helping me!  God Bless,  Mathew
I know, it sounds like I am talking about my apperience don't it. Well, sorry, I am talkin about the way I see things, and why I see things the way I do. We all have eves, dont we? But do we see? I hope that I have sight, and I also pray that you do to. I wonder why we dont all see things the same, I wonder why we see in ways so strange. What is it that we are looking to see, what is it that we strain to look, see? I know that I have been seeing only the way I wanted to till now. I know I still only see what I want, but I hope that as I look, what I see will become more clear to me.  Peace, Love and Righteousness!
