back tonight to respond to the night's big speeches.
***DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION***       &nbsp;  Former President Jimmy Carter finished his speech to the delegates at the Democratic National Convention&nbsp;in Boston a little while ago.&nbsp; It was a great speech.&nbsp; It was rousing, critical, and inspiring to the Democratic Party.&nbsp; He was a lot more critical of Bush than Gore was.&nbsp; I will be back in a half hour or so to respond to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Former President Bill Clinton with their speeches.
***DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION***     &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are a little bit into the big speeches of the first night of the Democratic National Convention.&nbsp; the rightful President of the United States, Al Gore, spoke at about 8 ET.&nbsp; He delivered a great speech.&nbsp; It war rousing, respectful, and inspiring.&nbsp; He joked a little bit in the beginning about the 2000 election and the recounts.&nbsp; He mentioned the word "Bush" only once.&nbsp; He laid out the case for Bush's re- defeat.&nbsp; All in all, it was a good speech.&nbsp; We are now waiting for former President Jimmy Carter in about 10 minutes.  *I will come back to blog later in the night and throughout the week to give my thoughts.
The 7 Minutes of Confusion
Many have been saying that they were surprised that Kerry didn't get much of a bounce from the DNC last week.  He didn't get much of a bounce probably because there was nothing to bounce to.  Only about 10% if that of the voting population are undecided, and those people probably won't vote in the end anyway.   urlLink http://http://www.slate.com/id/2104745/  Go here to see a credible person talking about how the polls are good for Kerry.  I would bet that Kerry will win and will probably win by a fairly large margin, maybe 5%.  That is a lot for this election.  Most of the undecideds will go for the challenger, Kerry.  Kerry victory in November.
I really do not like one "Democratic" Senator.  Zell Miller of Georgia, says that he is a Democrat and he is leading the GOP coalition group "Democrats for Bush".  He is  NOT    a Democrat.  You can see the transcript from his interview with Tim Russert  urlLink http://http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5574180/  here.  He is against a woman's right to choose, he is for the Marriage Amendment, and he is against Gun control, just to name a few things.  He fully supports the War in Iraq and has complains about how the Democratic Party has gone too far to the left for him.  He says that it has changed.  Well Zell, things have changed since the 1950's!!!  You are a Republican!!!  Just switch parties and get it over with.  The Republican party has also changed because issues and situations change.  Communism isn't an issue anymore.   If you want an example of flip-flopping,  just look at Senator Miller.  He delivered the keynote address at the 1992 Democratic National Convention that nominated Bill Clinton.  He supported Al Gore in 2000 and in 2001 spoke about Senator Kerry in very kind words.  He should leave the Party now because we don't want h
