before,  or perhaps,  CAUSE HIS MUG’S IN THE PAPER EVERY DAY.  Also,  Colin was not being mean to her.  Hard to believe,  I know,  if you read his stuff.  But again,  I’ve seen the tape a dozen times,  and he was actually gentler with her than I would have been and I am a tree-huggin’,  no-meat-eatin’,  gay-marriage-lovin’,  death-penalty-opposin’,  of-course-the-war-was-wrong LIBERAL.  Moments before he questioned her,  THK was babbling something about un-American and unPennsylvanian (??) traits creeping into something.  If anything needed clarification,  it was this.  And instead of just not seeking a follow-up with her and blasting her weird ramblings in the next day’s column,  Colin quite politely asked THK what the hell she was talking about.  Have I mentioned I’ve seen the tape a dozen times?  He said,  “You were mentioning something about un-American…….”  Leading her to finish her own statement.  When she shrieked that she hadn’t said that word _ even though we all have seen the proof that she freakin’did too say it _ Colin actually backed off and asked her, all right, what did you say then?  Which I think was more than fair.  And instead of clarifying herself, THK said shove it and bolted.  I cannot tell you how it galls me to feel like I have to stick up for Colin. But he’s right here. And she’s wrong.  And have I mentioned SHUT UP ABOUT IT?
I loved this: “I don't care if it's Sandy Berger or Warren Burger or Veggie Burger who walked off with 'code word' documents. . . . It's . . . the fact that it could happen -- that concerns the Committee."  Rep. Thomas M. Davis III (R-Va.) Don’t worry Mr. Davis,  most men like to think they have big secrets in their pants. Rarely is true.
In my perfect world, Subway would sell iced tea as good as the iced tea at Wendy's so that when I go out for lunch, I don't have to make two stops.
Man, this morning Pittsburgh was as smog-covered _ excuse me, OZONE-covered _ as I've ever seen it. In 10 summers, it has never looked as bad as it did on the way to work this morning.  You couldn't even see the top of Mount Washington. It just looked like the inclines were disappearing into a big, brown marshmellow.  I remember the day Isabel gave me a lift into LA and very helpfully pointed out that the thin brown line of haze on the horizon was "smog." I wanted to say, "That's not SMOG! Come to Pittsburgh in July and I'll show you smog." Except we don't call it smog. We call it ozone, which makes it sound like a good thing, but it isn't.  Bums me out. Cause really, I know I tell all of you this all of the time in my fruitless campaign to get everyone I know to move to Pittsburgh, it's not a dirty city. It's really clean. The steel mills are mostly gone and we're all civilized now, I swear. But the smog every summer bums me right o
