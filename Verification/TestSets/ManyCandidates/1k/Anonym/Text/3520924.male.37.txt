Newberry Medal, this book tells the story of eleven-year old Adam Quartermayne, son of the Roger the Minstrel. Set in 13th century England, "Adam of the Road" provides a fascinating glimpse into itinerant and medieval life.   The story opens with Adam enrolled at the school of Saint Albans Abbey, a situation he finds both irksome and temporary. Despite the reassuring presence of his loyal dog Nick, safely ensconced with a school neighbor for a penny per month, and his serious and studious friend Perkin, Adam longs to be on the road, living the minstrel life with his father.  Finally reappearing from his journeys in France to learn more minstrelsy, Roger, now in the service of a Lord, sweeps Adam up on to his gift of a warhorse and they're off. Author Gray shows a real skill for portraying the daily activities of the medieval life, the long meal preparations, the elaborate rituals of tending to a knight, the vibrant markets. At the same time, and in particular in passages tending to Adam's life in the home of the noble de Lisle family, Gray captures the interplay between young friends meeting for the first time, the petty jealousies and insecurities, and the budding friendships. Much as boys today might bond over an X-Box or a Sega system, Adam builds bonds with the other boys in service on the de Lisle estate during play jousting.  When Roger takes once again to the road, after all minstrels aren't generally kept full-time in service, Adam begins to learn some difficult lessons. Some gambling gone wrong with the wrong person eventually results in Adam's beloved Nick vanishing without a trace. In his haste to find the dog he loves, Adam and Roger are separated and a young boy of 11 is now roaming the English countryside, desperately looking for both, alone.   In part, the accomplishment of this book is showing that, while hardly common, it was not unusual to see an eleven-year-old boy on the English country roads. Adam encounters his share of challenges, setbacks, and kindnesses along this journey. As with the earlier sections of the book, Gray vividly portrays the homes, inns, fairs, meals, pubs, and churches of the time. Some readers will, no doubt, be surprised to read that Adam gets ale with his meals. Capturing the image of another time, its essence, its smells, its hue, is the art of seeing the sublime in the ordinary. Gray has an eye for the sublime and sees it in the ferrymen, in the Winchester Fair, in the songs of the minstrels, and in the regimented life of medieval monks.  "Adam of the Road" is not easy reading. Gray has produced a dense 317-page book with an impressive vocabulary and rich detail. As one reviewer commented aptly, young people who can easily digest massive Harry Potter tomes may have considerable difficulty with "Adam of the Road". For young people less than 10 years old, this is probably a "read it to me" book. The payoff for both parent and child is well worth it.   R
