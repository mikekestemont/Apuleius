for more than 30 seconds  - You are day dreaming for sessions of 5 minutes and above  - You are still laughing at shit that happened last nite  - Your typing has a stutter from the shakes  Gonna back it up again tonite :)
mmmm 2am finishes - who doesn't love them.  Especially when you are required at 8am.  Ahh the stories I'll tell my kids!!!  And in other news, the dilemma lost the problem. So in a little sadness I guess she doesn't throw away her life and is once again free to choose her own path.  Don't get me wrong, I am sure she would've made it work, but wow tuff choice.  Sadly there will be no eagle bar tonite.  One - i cbf and two - the second week usually doesn't pull the crowd.  Might opt for a quiet sip somewhere else.  Over  urlLink here  things have become a little more intricate with the  urlLink N  word saga.  I am too tired to even bother re-reading this for grammer and spelling.  Apologies up front! q.
Yes, it is wednesday night again.  Can only mean trouble especially if  urlLink this  fool is in town for the event!  Once again off to the regular and most likely bump into the dilemma.  Frankie will be off to the doctors tonight for a 3 day stay.  Hopefully he'll be back by monday.  Went and saw the  urlLink team  last night.  All is well there, with some guys doing well in the malaysian open.  Good news.  Even better will be my return, hopefully on Wednesday night.  Will the knee hold up - well there's only one way to find out.  check you later, Slater q.
So one name has popped up repeatedly.  Will put that in the memory bank. Also another lead has the names of those present on friday night.  I am sure through a simple process of elimination we will find out those responsible.  Odds on favorite that the same name will appear in this group too.  Then just match up the names to the photos I have been provided.  It's all too easy.  'Boy I'm glad I called that guy' - I AM that guy :) q
I tried to use that 'post a blog from email feature' but it never came thru.  But I think I am probably to blame for that.  Now, memo to the turds on friday nite.  If you want to play with the big boys children, be prepared to get hurt along the way.  Don't be surprised when you turn around and there is 115kg of 6'4" anger behind you.  You will be punished and wether it is one person for the team or the group of you receiving the punishment - this is up to whoever i get first.  Remember this - what you did to my car, I will be returning.  And I WILL find out who you are.  It has already begun.  hmm is the above just for my own benefit?  probably.  I mean, they may never read this.  Either way - it will happen   q
