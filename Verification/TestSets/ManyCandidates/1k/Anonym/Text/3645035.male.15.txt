Heres how it stands, slightly crooked.  Actually a lot of things are slightly crooked.  This is mainly because of the audacity of the ground, and the wooden spikes stuck in it.  Hey, thats how things work in Italy.  If it cant be built by sticking wooden spikes in the ground, and putting huge masses of marble on them, its not worth doing.  Take Venice for example, nice dont you think?  Not so nice however when you realize the whole city is being held up by small wooden spikes in the soggy swamp ground.  Niiiiice, now everybody knows how things collapse.  Speaking of collapsing, the colloseum has.  You know why?  Some genius started with wood.  Now all we have is half a colloseum.  Its true.  Ever seen two halves of the colloseum?  If you have, you know one of them is only half of a wall.  You know Pisa?  I don't think I need to explain that one, or alternatively look slowly back down the page(a process called reading) and understand why.  Wood.  Not only the buildings are crooked, so are the shady street vendors selling "follexes" and bags by "Guchi".  Would any of you like to know why I sound bitter?  Because I've been happy since I got on the plane, I need some time to figure myslef out before the smile Im wearing engulfs my body.  Alternatively its because im drinking gasy water(thats is awefull) and lusting after eurpean buties(men+women) oops... smile getting bigger... must get angry... cant contain all happiness.
