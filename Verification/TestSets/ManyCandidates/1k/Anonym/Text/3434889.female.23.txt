the dog decides he wants to make friends with our dog and starts running full pelt straight at our fence in the hope that through some strange turn of events the fence will cease to exist and he will reach the other side. well on Friday he did just that - the fence ceased to exist - well kind of anyway.  its all sorted now - at 1.46pm on monday arvo, but to cut a long story short a new fence was needed and now. So my darling Karma has been staying at my mother in laws house where she is no doubt being molested by their 10 year alsation regularaly and I now have a fencing contractor in the backyard putting up the new fence. wow, you must be thinking what a woman of substance and finesse to acheive so many results in so little time - I'm sorry to say I didnt. you see we ordered the fencing materials six months ago and have been trying to convince the neighbours that its kinda important to fix it sooner rather than later - only now with a massive hole in the fence did they realise that there might be a 'bit of a problem'. cut to Friday afternoon and me having an argument with the neighbours landlord who was choc-full of classic one-liners such as 'well its not my problem' and 'alrighty then' who finally agrees to send someone over from his building company (!) to put the fence up. We spent much of satday arvo pulling down the fence with no help from our gracious neighbours, and then spent the following day tearfully farewelling his sister (again-but ill get to that another day) who was leaving for london. so I cranked a sickie today - go on hurl your rotten fruit and stones at me - I deserve it. I was also out there this morning watching him do the string line that would determine where the fencing would be placed - just to make sure this didnt turn into some kind if land dispute! grrr paranoia! I promise, promise, promise to go back tomorrow - if I don't, then I think we'll have a serious problem!  so as you can see the moral of my first ever blog post is that I hate my neighbours, my job sux and that fences can be knocked down by small over-active staffordshire terriors.  I will leave you with a thought from the great Edgar Cayce - which has nothing to do with fencing and everything to do with what went wrong this morning - on my first day back when I cranked a sickie.  ' The mental is the builder. Hence the mental attitude has much to do with the physical conditions of the body, but it does not set broken bones, neither does it strengthen ligaments.... The attitude of the mind, if it is from spiritual forces and desires, will bring that which will build a life and an experience of peace, harmony and happiness.'                                                                                           - E.
