was easter weekend, and i went up to pa. during easter dinner appetizers i developed strep throat. went to the doctor monday only to find that they no longer accept our insurance, went to cvs to pick up amoxicillin, only to nearly faint in there, got a ride home from a really nice woman only to have to pick up my car later. missed two more days of work, bringing me farther into the negative.   last weekend was full of absolutely gorgeous weather. james' band came over to play in the afternoon, and while they played, i sat outside sipping a limeade cocktail or several and read my bookclub book. it was james' birthday, and after they left, we had a few more beers, decided to not cook dinner, and went out. a really perfect day.  sunday was 90 degrees. i finally got my car cleaned, vacuumed, and pinstriped! it feels like a new car. tonight we go see stereolab. that's all i have for now.
i was in a store this weekend that sells really cute clothes that are pretty pricey, mostly rightfully so and/or due to the fact that they're expensive brands. the store also has accessories. i saw that they had ribbon belts and quickly hurried over to check them out, since i had recently purchased materials to make a ribbon belt myself. they were $28. for oh, two ribbon lengths, two D rings, and (i think) some webbing inside. total materials cost: about $4. yes, horrifying. i went home and made mine instead of continuing to put it off. it took me about 20 minutes, and mine is a) more complex than the ones i saw and b) much cuter! i am sporting it today. here it is.
lately i've been thinking about drawing.  Sites like  urlLink this  and  urlLink this  have helped spur these thoughts. there was a time that i was drawing all the time, and i was good at it. it's been years since i was consistently drawing, and it shows whenever i attempt it. yesterday i resolved to begin a journal, one with words and pictures, but mostly pictures. i will use pen and be unrepentant about my efforts. i will force myself to keep at it until it comes back to me. i know it will, it will just take some self-inflicted ego wounds.   i'll get started as soon as i make the journal. and a little thing to hold my pens. i have all of the materials. just need some time.
css-based. wish i could say i made it from scratch, but i didn't--it's one of the blogger ones modified. one day.
obviously, blogger comment code does not like my template. that means a redesign is imminent, just not now, since i am super-busy at work.
this is just a test....
I did not get the Zebrano. Instead, I am now the proud owner of a brand new Marin San Rafael. It is shiny and silver and gorgeous and feels  good  to ride. I can't keep my mouth closed when I ride--I'm too busy smiling. Bug-Eating G
