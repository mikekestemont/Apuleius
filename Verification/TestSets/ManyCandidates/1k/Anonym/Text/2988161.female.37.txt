for hopefully a LONG time since he was a little bit wearing while we were out running errands after our hike.  I am taking the time to catch up here and then will do some reading and chores if time permits - probably in that order.  I should also be planning more time to visit my friend who is dealing with her breast cancer and with mom and dad as mom recuperates from her bilateral knee replacement.  I have actually spent 2 nights at home now.  I'll give mom a call soon and will probably go back down there tomorrow.   & maybe over to my friend's this afternoon.  Her birthday is Thursday and I need to get her card in the mail.   I am just rambling now.  I guess I should be less esoteric here except I don't think anyone is actually reading my blog.  So it's okay to write solely for myself.  Along those lines I have decided to not share my blog with anyone I personally know.  I just wouldn't want to write anything unintentionally that might hurt their feelings - what would that gain?   Now I'm having trouble completing my thoughts so this is all for today.  Maybe I'll feel more literary another day.
Well, I made it through another few hurdles, timewise.  My mom had her double knee replacement 2 days ago.  We drove down the day of surgery and spent time with her that afternoon/evening.  Then we drove back down last night and I spent the night with her so Dad could go home and get a good rest.   It's rather ironic, but Mom is a nurse at the hospital where she had her surgery and yet she is DEATHLY afraid of being left alone at the hospital because she is certain the nurses / caregivers there will kill her.  I think that is a very sad statement about nursing care in this country.  You would think that she would be 'wired into the system' and be able to get the very best care they have available in the hospital - but it doesn't quite work that way.  Granted I think she is somewhat phobic and paranoid without cause, but she has had some very questionable care while there.  Having been in the hospital quite a bit over the last 2 years - during my pregnancy and my son's RSV hospitalization I have seen some very dramatic differences in the quality of nursing skills.  With all that said, Mom is trying very hard to get released from the hospital ASAP which will leave my father as her primary caregiver at home.  I think that is a huge burden for him but he is a trooper and will do the best he can.  I am afraid that his best is often not good enough for mom - but they have managed pretty well for the 38 years they have been married.   The next few weeks will be busy with shuttling back and forth to visit mom and take care of DS and the store, etc, etc.   Gotta r
