a bit scary, but that's just because I was traumatized. The way I see it is that if it's creepy, poke it. Then, based upon its reaction, do it again, and again, and again. Then it'll just cry a lot. There, now it's not creepy anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp; :P  &nbsp;   {Geoffrey}
Yeah this is my first post using this system...I'm not really sure what I'm doing but oh well...  My Live Journal: www.livejournal.com/users/blacklight05
It honestly depends on the situation, but seeing as how they are usually played by toothless carnies trying to screw with little kids' minds I say they are creepy.&nbsp; Maybe not to the little kids, but to me they are.&nbsp; Plus there's almost never a girl clown so it's always just a bunch of guys doing stupid and sometimes randy things to one another.&nbsp; ... but that's just me.  --Ashley M.

Hello all!&nbsp; This sounds fun... yet another distraction... help me remember my friends during college.&nbsp; Well... let's get this thing started huh?&nbsp;    Topic of discussion: &nbsp; Clowns: creepy or funny?
Ooh, this should be an interesting blog! I wanna have a cool "business-type" title! What can I be? The CEO will appoint me, I suppose. Okay, well, bye for now!
-- Yup. Uh huh.   Always,  Jacob
Hello all!&nbsp; Well, this will be a wonderful way for us all to discuss whatever it is we want to!&nbsp; I am very excited for the potential this blog holds.&nbsp; As the first person besides&nbsp;Geoffrey to post on it I think I shall proclaim myself his Executive Assistant.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I shall.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; Anyway, I look forward to the probably&nbsp;mostly random things that will&nbsp;appear on here.&nbsp; ---Ashley--- &nbsp;
Another blog is created and another adventure is to begin. This blog could turn out to be a very exciting place. It could have crazy arguments and debates or it could have hilarious limericks posted by a few of those randier people. This should be an alltogether wonderful experience. I hope you all enjoy.    &nbsp;   {  Geoffrey}
