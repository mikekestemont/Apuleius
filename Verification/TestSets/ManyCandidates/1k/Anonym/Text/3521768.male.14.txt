was all like, "Aw you girls are leaving?" I was thinking 'OMG! DAD!!! SHUT UP! >_>.' But anyways, We went shopping alot and I got some sleeveless shirts, a hemp necklace, a bathing suit, and some goggles.   We met some People from England too. They were really nice. The mom and dad weere Trevor and Mandy. Since thye had an accent, she said it like 'Mundy" so my dad kept saying Mundy instead of Mandy. >_> It was annoying. They also had 2 daughters, one was 15, Jo Ann,  and ther other was 12, Jemma. Don't worry I didn't do anything with Jo Ann, she had a huge crush on my brother anyways. She was like a 'party animal' I guess you would say. She drinks beer at home and has all night parties in the forest. Jemma was cool though. I guess, never really talked to her much. I didn't really talk to anyone much when they were there. I was like the odd one out almost the entire trip. It was my parents and their parents, Taylor(my bro) and Jo Ann, Lauren(my sis) with Jemma, and Me with....me and my thoughts.  The rest of the time after they left, I was still the 5th wheel, my sister would like hog my mom, because she's just like that and my dad and brother woul just walk around and leave me there, again, with my thoughts. It gave me alot of time to think about what I want to do with Laura though. Which is a definite plus. On the fourth, My dad and I, the first time I wasn't really be myself outside the hotel, walked along the beach, watching the fireworks. Everywhere I looked, I saw couples. It didn't really help me missing Laura a whole lot. All I could think about was how much I loved her and how much I wanted her there with me to sit on the beach together and watch the fireworks.  Also, before the fourth, there was this group of army guys getting ready to go back to Iraq, and the eldest, Jason, was the son of the manager of the hotel. And they were right next to us. They kept making my dad chug beer from that funnel and tube, Lauren was freaking out, it was great. Anyways, they took my brother one night to a strip club, the night before I went deep sea fishing. Boy was that fun!   Lauren, my dad, Taylor and I all got sea sick, in the order. I've never been sea sick before and it suprised me. I only got sick at the very end though so it wasn't all that bad. Cept I didn't catch anything >_>. Oh well, It was still fun.  Basically, the rest of the trip was the beach, swimming and eating out. Oh and playing NCAA 2003 for my GCube. I finally beat lauren, she was invincible in that game. Then, of course, she accused me of cheating... But anyways, the trip was a blast and I'm glad I'm home.  -
