a PHANTOM OF THE OPERA CD!!! They are the coolest aunt and boyfriend uncle ever! whoohoo! We played on the car. I got my butt all wet with the windshield fluid. (I'm sort of lame like that.)   Today, The Brain Drain Machine: Sat on my butt and watched Monk. It is the best show on television. I think. I don't watch enough television to say so, but it captivates my interest for 60 minutes of my day, so it must not be bad.  And now here I am ignoring my siblings. I should probly go and make sure they're sleeping at 1 in the morning. Just a thought. Goodnight. Farwell. I wish this blog could sing like in the Sound of Music. That would be cool.
First of all . . . Lauren, tomorrow you WILL! I really wanna go to HOM!  So . . . I got a letter from Mr. Suppon. He is one of my favorite teachers, if not my favorite teacher. I love photo way much, but I am pretty darn good at screwing things up in that department. Cheating is bad, especially if you are a really bad cheater and you end up making it look like you were cheating even more than you were before. Yeah, so, that made no sense. However, I did it. I muddled up coppying the end of a simple paper into turning in the wrong paper and looking like a total lying idiot. I suppose I deserve it though. But how lame is it to end the year with an "  INCOMPLETE  " in your favorite class? Extraordinarily lame. So, now I have to do this stupid paper for the fourth and possibly fifth time to compensate for getting a low score on it the third time around because I didn't have my study guide anymore. I am going to go and sit on my butt and finish this dumb thing as neatly and perfectly as I possbibly can to ensure honesty and completion. Yikes oh mighty. I'm like the fugitive or something. A bientot!
