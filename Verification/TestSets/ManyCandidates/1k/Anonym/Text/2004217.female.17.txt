didn't want to leave, and I went home and to bed, where I didn't sleep. I don't know why, but I just didn't. Not until about 5am, anyway, which was a bit pointless because I was up again at 7am to get the bus to Nottingham. I was met at the station by James, who promptly whisked me to UGC Nottingham where everyone else was to see Shrek 2. Lots of hugs and kisses and "let me carry your bag"s occurred, and then we went in to see the film, which was absolutely hilarious. Go and see Shrek 2, I'm a total convert to the whole thing, after hating the first one. We went back to the meeting house, and lots of games were played and diaries kept and cuddles had. Sean and I got really close this weekend, brought together by various things I never knew we had in common, he let me share his duvet and lean into him when we sat down... he made me think, too.  So now I'm back at home again, far, far away from everyone I want to be close to, missing them all like crazy, and none of them are online. I want a hug and a kiss and to keep my diary and play Honey If You Love Me or Ratchet Screwdriver, but I can't because no one else gets those games, or the way we are at JYF. 17th September seems so far away...  Ceff x   It's just a little crush, not like I faint every time we touch
I feel so drained today. I don't know why, as I've done nothing that's really required a lot of energy. Well, I had a driving lesson; they always seem to take it out of me, seeing as they're so damn stressful. We did awareness, anticipation and planning today, all of which I was rubbish at. I'm so envious of people who can drive.  The Leavers' Ball is tomorrow. It'll be the last time I will see a lot of people with whom I've spent the last 7 years co-existing, so it's going to be happy, sad and strange all at the same time. Maybe in 20 years I'll run into someone in the supermarket, someone I wasn't that close to, and we'll squint at each other, and say each others' names unsurely and then have an uncomfortable conversation about our lives now, and whether we still talk to anyone from school, which we probably won't. Alternatively, even worse, I could run into Laura/Becky/Debbs/Selina, with whom I'd lost contact with over the years, and we had nothing to talk about. I think I might just move to Leeds. And then JYF finally occurs on Saturday! Huzzah. My sorry ass will arrive in Nottingham at 11am, hopefully, and then for the next 36 hours much fun will be had by all. Twice.  So here ends my first day as a proper grown up. Thoroughly wasted, I think you'll agree. Only 3 more months of them to go...  Ceff x   If I only had a n
