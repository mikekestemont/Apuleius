a way of lifting the spirits. That may or may not be true. I kinda just made it up but I'm sure a change of scenery won't hurt. Anyways, I must take care of things here right now.
The Cure show was awesome.  We didn't get in for free as I had hoped but it was almost worth the $36.  I talked to Andrew before we left and he informed me that Muse was going on at 7.  This was unfortunately at 5:30 which give me almost enough time to make the drive if I don't stop at all.  It turns out that I hit some construction on the way up and, well, had to push my little Escort to it's limits.  I had told Brandon to go ahead without me but I figured he hadn't left yet so I met him at his house.  Well, we were both starving at that point so we stopped at Wendy's and the gas station.  So we get off at the exit and stop to see how much the scalpers want for tickets.  They offer us 5th row for $50 each.  I had looked online and it said tickets were $17 to $51 so we passed thinking lawn seats were $17.  Wrong.  We end up paying the $36 at the door which is a bit more than I'm acustomed to but we could see and hear Muse playing and we couldn't turn back.  We got to see about half of their set.  They had a great light show which would have been much cooler if it had been dark.  Then we watched Interpol for their first song.  Then we went back to the second stage to get a good spot for Thursday.  I must admit I haven't listened to Thursday for about a year and a half but I was pretty impressed by their newer stuff.  The Cure was next and I can't say I'm super into the Cure.  They played their new single third which I thought was kinda odd.  Another oddity was that they played all their older hits right in the middle of their set, at least all that I could think of.  Anyway, Brandon and I left early and spotted a very strange looking tree.  It looked like it had people in the trunk.  I took some pictures which will be up shortly.  Then we rented movies and watched Waiting for Guffman until I headed home.
So, I got this letter from school veryfying my grant moneys and there's a little more than I expected.  Turns out I qualified for a Pell Grant also.  It appears that I have more than enough to cover tuition and books now.  That makes me very, very happy:) .  So happy that to keep it going I'm going to try to go see the Cure and Muse tonight.  We made a very loose plan to get in and such while we were drunk Saturday night.  I'm not sure if the person that the plan depends most on remembered that plan.  We will find out soon e
