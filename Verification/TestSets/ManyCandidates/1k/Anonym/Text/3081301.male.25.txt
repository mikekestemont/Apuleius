informed people also say that Michael Moore has an agenda of his own. Of course he does. Is it just his imagination that the world has deteriorated over the last four years? Who wants more of that?  Bush hangs his hat on the war in Iraq, the supposed "War On Terror". All the while, he is ignoring the main problems here at home: poverty (though, not in the Bush house), unemployment, and the completely bogus Patriot Act. Now, now, some of you might be saying that the Patriot Act is a good thing. It keeps the terrorists from attacking us. Ask yourself this one question, though. What evidence is there that the Patriot Act is doing anything other than inhibiting our freedoms, especially freedom of speech? Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if I got a "visit" in the near future for writing this. Whatever. This was the kind of talk that led to America being born over a bicentennial ago.  I hope that people thinking that everything is okay, just want to see the movie to see what the controversy is all about. I want those people to pay close attention to Flint, Michigan resident Lila Lipscomb (I'm going to refrain from making fun of this name, in order to not deflate my message). I'm not going to say why but I hope that viewers go through the same cerbral process this woman did during her struggle. And then see what a great job you think Bush is doing then.  Ignorance is bliss, people. The fact that so many think everything is hunky fucking dory is because they don't have a fucking clue as to the reality that surrounds them.  Also, I realize that this was more of a soapbox moment and there was no real anger or humor contained in this post.  Tough shit. Go see  Fahrenheit 9/11  and don't be a dumbass come November.  I, hereby, get off the soapbox and smash it into kindling.
I have realized that, as many people that I have met over the last 25 years (dear God, it  has  been that long), that I have never met someone named Brian that wasn't an uber-tool.    What's that? I lack evidence. Is your name Brian and claim not to be a shitlick fagwoman? I haven't met you, so I guess I should reserve judgment before calling you a raging bitchtard. But if you need proof, click on the title of this article and check out this cock-kneading swallowhog. And since this is my forum to say whatever the hell I want...fuck you, Brian and fuck all other Brians everywhere in your silly billy goat asses.  In fact, I would like to start a petition right now to eradicate the name Brian from every language and replace it with this:    Fuck-Brian    No wait...    Fuck-brian. There's no point in capitalizing such an unimportant word.    So please feel free to tell this particular fuck-brian and all other fuck-brians you know exactly what you think of their sad, pathetic, shaft-longing homo-cracy.    I guess I feel a little bit better n
