kids around and we were always prepared for it when it happened. But this one was different. In the middle of lunch at camp, we all hear the air horn (the signal for a Lost Bather) go off. I got up and ran towards the lifeguard shack to check on what was wrong and get a description of the kid. I never got that far. Ig got a description from Ryan as he was running to the bathrooms to check for a Kevin last seen wearing blue shorts. So I sprint over to the fields to check over there. The fields are all clear, so I spring back over the water. I don't think I have ever ran that fast in my life and as I learned from campers, who were watching the whole thing from the Nukem court, that was like a blur I was running so fast. At the water, I ran into the lake where I linked arms with the other counselor where we would rake the lake with our feet to try to find the kid in the water. Now, at this point, none of us knew whether this was a drill or the real thing. We made about five sweeps of the swimming area before we finally moved beyond the ropes and started to sweep the other sections of the lake. At that point, we were all call out of the water and up onto the beach. Lifeguards and counselors were crying left and right. We were all told to sit down while the head guard ran over to check on what was going on. He came back and told us it was all a drill. You cannot believe the relief we all felt when we heard that. People were really shaken up after that exercise. But I was really surprised with myself. I was not effected at all, not even a little bit. I was so focused on our task at hand, finding the kid, that no other emotions or thoughts took over. I was sure that I would have felt something afterward, but there was still nothing. Very strange indeed.  A lot of people were angry that we were put through that, but I think it was one of the best things I have ever done. I showed exactly how I would react in a really life emergency, and I was extremely happy with my results. I was also extremely pleased with the actions and reactions of my fellow staff members. We were perfect in that situation. We made no blunders or mistakes and if there had been a kid in the water, we would have definitely found him or her before significant brain damage appeared. Again, I am extremely happy with how both I behaved and how the staff reacted to the situation.  Wow, I'm glad I got all that off my chest, it was starting to get really heavy. Well, typing all of that tired me out for the night and off to bed. So go away and leave me be.  O
