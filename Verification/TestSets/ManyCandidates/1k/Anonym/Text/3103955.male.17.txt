I was from, and when I said Banbridge, he told me he knows someone from Banbridge, Kerry Shields, who I also know (not personally though,but I know her sister . . .). Pretty damn strange, it really is a small world! Also, on the jet boat thing, and old Canadian guy started telling me that he was Irish, just like every other person in Canada I'd met had, but he actually knew Banbridge, and was able to rhyme of all the small crappy villages and other towns surrounding it, so I'm guessing he has more reason to say he's Irish than most, even though he sounds Canadian, ay? Anyway, now I'm with the Synkowskies(spelling?) and they are cool.It's a different experience from the Voices, because Port Dover is a wee small town compared to big Niagara City, and also because I have a lot more freedom to go walk-a-bouts and stuff, and they actualy let me help out around the house a bit, so I don't feel completely useless!!! Anyway, that's all I could be bothered writing, I could go into a helluva lot more detail, but whats the point, no-ones actually going to read this anyway!!!
Yay!Exams are long finished(well,a week ago, but it seems a lot longer), and I am currently writing this blog from the Voice's house in Niagara Falls!!! This place is great, I'm a very big fan of Canada at the minute : P(booo America). Because the city is the biggest tourist city in the world(joint with Paris I was told), there is a lot to do as you can imagine! The actual Niagara Falls is great, you really dont appreciate how large it is until you stand right beside it (or behind it as I did yesterday). Its one of those things me being me would goand stare at everyday for a very long time. Then there are casinos and arcades and museums and shops and cinemas and other touristy style stuff, very nice indeed. I saw Spiderman 2 last night too!!! . . . It actually sort of sucked . . . It was a good movie, but it didnt' really live up to the Spiderman legacy. Canadians talk pretty much the same as Americans, except they say "aboot" instead of about, and they throw in "eh" at the end of every sentence, just like a Northern Irish spide says "like".Everything is written in English AND French, because of all the Quebec people, so I'm relearning all my GCSE knowledge in the morning times by reading cereal boxes! Everybody here is Irish or Scottish or English, nobodies Canadian :S On Sunday night some guy told me he was Scottish, English and Irish, so I told him you could tell by his accent.I dont think he likes me very much anymore . . . :P Anyway, I could go on and on and on, and on a wee bit more, but I'm not gonna, because I dont wanna sitin front of this computer for any longer 'cause it's such a class day outside!!!Talk to you l
