hey i was looking through old xanga entries and found this entry in which i was talking about time and was reminded of the discussions about time we've had so i'm just gonna post part of that entry here:  time is weird... this morning when i had to write this essay last minute, the minutes went by like seconds and now its 3:50 and it seems like it was 3:45 so long ago.  sometime i believe time is a measure of something immeasurable... or rather that time just can't be measured... that's why its so impalpable.  i've always had trouble measuring time.  like when someone asks me how long i've been waiting on line or something like that i feel inadequate estimating and i'm sure i estimate wrongly all the time... maybe its because i don't carry watch ever but i just think that time is something you can't grasp really if you're someone who can look a little beyond the reality of everyday life... in this case, the smarter you are, the harder it is for time to sit well with you, or something like that....  ok peace out people!
i biked today!!  my friend had ridden her bike to school so as we're leaving she's like, "erika, how bout i help you bike?"  at first, i adamantly resisted.  there were a lot of reasons not to: it was the senior lawn, that just something you don't do on the senior lawn; i was wearing a skirt and flip flops; i had no gear and i guess i'm lucky i didn't crack my head open.  but then she seemed to be mad at me and then i thought, hey she has reason to be.  i'm being a dumbutt little goody goody.  so i did it and it made me so happy. ok, i'm not a pro yet but i did it on my own for at least six cycles! lol. that was so refreshing...  suitable is a sore to the soul.  do something unsuitable everyday, or at least once a week.
With the new computer, I'm able to add more effects and able to work faster on the 'project'. HOWEVER, the scanner from the old computer doesn't work for the new one. So I can't really get any developed pictures unless sent by e-mail or me taking a load of time scanning it in the old computer and transferring it to the new one.   So my point: It would really mean a lot if you guys could send me pix thru email or something. I think I need to fill about a little more than a minute. I don't need a lot though. Group pictures are preferred, please!  Luv ya!
have fun all of you!  : )
