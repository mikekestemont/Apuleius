urlLink    Here it is!  There is gravel in the yard because it was recently a gift shop and this was the parking lot!  We will have it moved and a nice pretty green yard by next summer, I hope!  The wheel chair ramp will also be gone.  Landscaping needs some touchups, but the current owners said they will try to do clean it up a little bit...  as long as they are doing all the painting, I'm not worried about it.&nbsp; urlLink
Well, I've been wanting to do comments that have a popup box instead of a separate page, so I installed Haloscan. Sadly, I knew that doing that would erase all the previous comments I had gotten. So, because I love you all so much.... do this for me... COMMENT! Please? Even on old posts if you want. Even things you have commented on before.  I just look so unpopular (haha) without all of your input.  Please?  If you love me, you'll do it.   Don't you love me?   Ok, if you LIKE me, you'll do it.   Don't you like me?  See, I'm all sad. My comments are all gone.  Make me happy, por favor?
Two major things have been going on.   ONE :   We are getting our house!!!  Hooray!  We were able to agree on a price, and now all we have to do is work up the purchase agreement and do all the appraisal and termite stuff and then close.  I am so excited!  The people we are buying it from are doing all of the painting (in my choice of colors), shampooing the carpets, and doing anything that needs doing to pretty much.  Bub and I already went shopping for new furniture because we have a huge greatroom to fill up.  Hooray!   I am going to post pictures as soon as I can.   TWO :   Went to the doctor today to see about getting back on some sort of weight loss pills.  Long story, short: About 3-4 years ago I was really fat, got on Adipex, and lost 30 pounds - down to size 4-6.  Since then, the weight has been slowly creeping back.  Even after lipo last summer, I still continued to gain weight in other places (fat lady arms, helllllo).  So now I am RIGHT back to where I started when I was really fat.  I have made attempts at exercise though; Steph and I have been walking in the mornings abouuuut 1 mile and a half maybe?  I am also going to start walking with my mom and Laurie in the evenings... they walk 3 miles at a time.  So today I walked a total of .... 4+ miles!!!  Maybe close to 5?  Don't know. I also have only eaten a Sonic salad today, and that is only because I bought it last night before I remembered my parents were cooking supper.  I really hope I can stick to it this time.  I don't like feeling crappy about myself.  So that's my progress.  Wish me luck with the house and the not eating.  I'm gonna need i
