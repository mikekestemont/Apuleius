This girl..well...we will just call her the hore...well she wirtes all this stuff about diante...how he is a sexy porn star and dumb shit.. and then they go out to the movies yesterday...ok me and this hore were supposed to be cool and everything...me and diante were trying to work things out and she and her horeness try and move in on him...come on you know that is horeish??? Or maybe i am over reacting but...I am still calling her a hore! What kind of girl does that to another girl they know and knows that there are still feeling between me and diante...I dunno...a hore!! O well i am over it she is a hore....So cheer is today and my body could hurt more...weight lifting, running, conditiong....I am going to die!! Going out to dinner though so at least there is food to look foward to! Oh and i got to thank my best friend karen...I love you...my lil rock...I would be in the middle of the ocean drownding if not for you....Hey there is this thing..a house party flyer we got last ngiht...we want to go...but you have to be 18...anyone got fake ids??? ha ha
ok first off this "blog" is called in cursive because i used to have a book i wrote potery and stuff in and one day my best friend, Karen, noticed when i really felt deeply about my subject/topic I wrote in cursive...so that is that! moving along. Today..well to really know me you would have to know this boy named diante...whom i am unforteantly utterly in love with...for about two years. There has been an unbelievable amount of drama, crying, broken hearts and so on between the two years of us. Well so we had evrything going great and then all the sudden thign hit a brick wall..like a million mile brick wall, for nothing in this world can blow down that wall...I cried to him last night telling him how much i cared for him and wanted things to work out....his responce...I am tired! WTF!!!! I was so pissed so i hung up..talked to him today on the internet and he says he needs time..i am nto the girl to sit around and wait...hey it has been two years..don't you think he would know by now if he cares about me and wants to be with me....i think ashlee simpson put it best " these are times when i realise i am 19 and a girl" well i am not 19 but i feel that way! Hey i am just a dumb girl what do i know! Well i have a million urges to call this boy but i am not going to..i will be strong! My best friend is helping me out and we are not going to get down..cause we are wonderful girls and no need for boys right.....Hey there is always the option of being a nun!!Well i have high hopes for tommorow....cheer and working out...everythign should be g
