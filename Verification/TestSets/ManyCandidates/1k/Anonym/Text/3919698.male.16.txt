before they attack.  He is likely to reduce our troop commitments in Afghanistan and Iraq, and he is unlikely to militarily intervene in any additional terrorism-sponsoring countries.  Kerry is likely to return to the reactive and appeasing policies of the Clinton administration.  He would wait for a terrorist attack to occur and then he would respond symbolically and ineffectively, similar to Clinton's cruise missile response to the 1998 embassy bombings.  Kerry would likely return to a carrots-only policy to get North Korea and Iran to dismantle their nuclear weapons programs, based on the incredibly na√Øve assumption that dictators will be good if we are good to them.         The most horrifying reality confronting the civilized world right now is the possibility that terrorist groups can acquire or manufacture weapons of mass destruction.  All other issues are insignificant by comparison.  Consequently we can never return to a reactive counter-terrorism policy.  Democrats, still assuaging their Vietnam-induced guilt, cannot be trusted to proactively prosecute the War on Terrorism. Whatever other virtues Senator Kerry may have, his inherent pacifism and predictable reactivity to terrorist threats makes him unqualified to be a wartime president.

The video was made by a local news station in 1971.   It directly contradicts Kerry's own website headline: "RIGHTWING FICTION: John Kerry threw away his medals during a Vietnam war protest."  Kerry's campaign refused comment Sunday afternoon, citing a policy not to respond to the DRUDGE REPORT.
