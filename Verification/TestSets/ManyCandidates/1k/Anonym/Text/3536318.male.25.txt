...is going to a House Music Party in some club because his roomate works there and he gets a Euro for every person that shows up with the flyers he's signed....  I'm taking bets on how long I'll last...  (I can hear it now: 6 hours of BOOM chick BOOM chick BOOM chick BOOM chick...)
Someone out there is having the best day of their lives... someone is falling in love, someone is crying because they're so happy, someone is having sex, someone is having a baby, someone is starting their first day on the job, someone is learning how to play an instrument, someone is moving away from home, someone is making a new best friend, someone is having their first kiss...   Someone is doing something they'll always remember...   Someone is reading this blog (I'm sure THAT'S something you'll always remember!)    Are you doing something worth remembering today???

Oh, one more thing... If you were unsuccesful in the past (I'm talking about the comments here), and you have a pop-up window blocker running on your computer, then:  Try changing the settings on the pop-up blocker to allow you to click open new windows  Or, an easier way is to hold down the CTRL button while you click the link that opens the new window.
