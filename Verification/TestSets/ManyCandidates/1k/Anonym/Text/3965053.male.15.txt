downright terrified.  as for the story, it's coming along fairly well, but it's certainly not the games strong point. there are a few mysterious elements that are interesting enough to make you curious, but it ain't no  half-life .  the more i play, the more this game seems faithful to the original  doom  games. as a  huge  fan of the originals, i'm confident to say this game really is the original formula with a ridiculous engine slapped over it. this creates some problems, but they are no match for the better parts. it's not complex, it's not deep, it's just a game thats light on strategy and extremely heavy on straight-up action and tension.  more updates will follow as i blast on through the giant floating heads, rocket-launcher skeletons, and demonic bulls. stay in touch.
if you ever have the chance to go to  ireland,  do  not  pass it up. for me to describe how much i love it in words would take a whole different blog, so i'll just say that - other than my bed - it is my favorite place in the world.    i managed to make it home in time to pick up  doom 3  the day it came out, august 3rd (as if you didn't know) and i can honestly say i'm scared.  the first ten minutes or so of play is action-less, just lets you and the controls get introduced, creates the setting and the mood, establishes a plot and characters, and builds some tension (if you pick up anyone elses PDAs, you can see eerie clues of the forthcoming disaster). Then, all at once, in about three seconds - excuse the pun - all hell breaks loose. Almost immediately after meeting an edgy scientist who is transformed into a rabid zombie with glowing eyes, the entire facility is torn to shreds. the lights are constantly jittering from bright to complete darkness, the walls are falling apart, structures are collapsing, and all around you echoes the tortured sounds of the others trapped in the labs, accompanied by hellish howls and abstract sounds, with some creepy whispering and alarmingly loud bashes thrown in for effect. you'll encounter various demonic enemies and pop-out situations that will have you leaping from your seat as you travel from room to room. so, i'm a little more than two hours into it and yes, i will admit, i am scared.  but it's just too much fun to stop playing. i'll keep you posted as i journey (as spoiler free as i can) through this crazy environment.     the futureheads  have been compared to  franz ferdinand , and while that is valid in some ways, i think that doesn't give them enough credit.  the futureheads   do  create dancy-pop-rock type of music that you can't help but sing along to, but they infuse the songs with their own stylish touch that keeps them from sinking into anonymity or simply being labeled as a  franz  rip-off. you should definitely check them out at  urlLink www.thefutureheads.com   sounds like ..::.. radio 4, franz ferdinand with more b
