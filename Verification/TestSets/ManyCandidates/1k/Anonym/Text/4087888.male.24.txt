The art of the deception is just that, an art.  So when I walked into the theater this weekend to see The Village by M. Night Shyamalan, I expected to see someone at the very peak of his profession. What I discovered was a different monster altogether.   A short synopsis goes as such.  A small farming community located in western Pennsylvania has an isolated way of life.  The town's citizens never venture past their own borders for fear that the creatures living in the woods might attack them.  The creatures, M. Night doing "creature" better than anyone else, are shrouded in the unknown and evoke fear as well as any of Night's previous creations.  The cast including Adrien Brody William Hurt, Joaquin Phoenix, Sigourney Weaver and newcomer Bryce Howard all give focused performances.  Howard, basically the main character in the film's second half, is the reason to go see this film.  She is striking and powerful as Ivy Walker, although someone forgot to tell her she was blind in some of the movie's earlier scenes.  As a movie, The Village is a transition work for Night.  Not his best because it strays from the singlular conventions that made him the moneymachine he is today.  Yet, this is not a negative in my opinion.  The acting here flourishes where the sublties of Phoenix and the strength of Howard carry the depth of emotion that is necessary for an audience to root for the characters instead of merely passing time to see the twists and turns Night delivers at the end.  Brody, playing a mentally disabled villager, may seem underused but rather his simplicities are some of the best examples of deep seeded envy and love in the film.  The one failure here is Weaver who with her limited screentime didn't seem to make an impact opposite Hurt.  There seemed to be a storyline there that Night never bothered to explore.  The other part of the film, the part we know Night from, where he uses his Hitcockian flair is surprisingly just a diversion in this film, a tool at his disposal.  A few brilliant scenes from this mode only appear sparingly throughout the film.  When Night wants to scare and decieve he can do so at will, but here it seems he did so only to draw in the audience to his character piece.  It was as if Night couldn't decide what he wanted his movie to be.  In Night's wake is a puzzle of parts that some audiences will determine is worth the price of admission while others will feel they were cheated.  The true result, however, is a director growing beyond his boundaries and for the first time taking his actors along with him.  He only asks that you join him on the journey.
