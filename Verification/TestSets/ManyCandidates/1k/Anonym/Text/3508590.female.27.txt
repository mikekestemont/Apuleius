blocked by trees, so no one could really see what is going on. The scary thing is, I was planning on leaving work earlier because of the long hours I have to work tomorrow. I'm glad I waited. The only setback is I won't be able to watch clear, crystal movies on DVDs. I'll have to go back and rent videos for awhile. But I'd rather deal with that inconvenience than be in ICU or a coffin.
My story has nothing to do with the Anime film. It is a warning for those who still enjoy blowing large bubbles while chomping on one of the most popular confections in our country. This afternoon I was reminded why adults should not blow bubbles while chewing gum. About half the piece stuck to my face after I blew a huge blue bubble while driving in my car. The piece that took away my dignity: Dubble Bubble bubble gum. The cheap, chalky gum you used to get in boxes of Count Chocula. It all started Friday, when Kevin, one of my co-workers brought in a bag of gum. Several of us in the newsroom spent the day regressing to our childhoods as we chewed and popped bubbles while writing our stories. On Saturday, I stopped by the office to pick up a notepad and looked inside the wooden box on my desk where we keep candy. To my luck, there were a few pieces of gum left. So I took a piece and popped it in my mouth as I left the newsroom. Driving back home, I returned to my youth, when my friend Tiffany and I would enter bubble gum blowing contests in South Bound Brook NJ (where we used to live). I began to blow bubbles while listening to music, forgetting my age and how ridiculous I must look to other drivers while stopped at traffic lights. For those of you who are gum aficionados, you know how well Dubble Bubble works in bubble blowing. As I was driving home from the grocery store, I decided to blow the largest bubble I could. I pursed my lips and exhaled steadily as the blue sphere ballooned. The mass grew larger than I expected, nearly touching the tip of my nose. Then the bottom gave out. The bubble collapsed, smacking onto my lips and chin before imploding completely. I pulled the remainder of the piece in my mouth and continued chewing and touched my chin with my hand to feel how much remained. When I pulled up to the house, I looked at the mirror behind the sun visor in my car and saw blue goo all over my chin and lips. I rushed into the house and took a piece of ice from the freezer to remove the gum. It took me about five minutes, ice and hydrogen peroxide to remove the gum. I'll leave bubble blowing to the kids.
