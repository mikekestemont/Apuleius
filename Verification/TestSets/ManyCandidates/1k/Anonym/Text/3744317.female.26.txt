I can't close the deal on this Woddy Allenish protype from my improv class. I'm all "Helllooo purr.." and he's all "What?"  Today I woke-up horrified. Why can't I close the deal? I looked in the mirror.. nope, I'm not a sea hag. I'm bright, funny marginally neurotic and cute as a fucking button. I am at my wits end. And I have a lot of wit.  There are guys that are out of my league... and this guy is not one of them. If anything I'm better looking than he is. I have ZERO DEALS.

I'd probably bag more dudes.

I`m a 26 yo molecular biologist, currently employed and working in Basel, Switzerland for a pharmaceutical company but coming from Croatia. In the beginning of September, I will start my PhD program at NYU, School of Medicine and I will be doing my research at the Musculoskeletal Research Center, Hospital for Joint Diseases on 14th street.. This is why this area is great for me. Unfortunately, I will be working here till the 25th of August and will be arriving to New York on 29th. I have booked a hotel for 3 days hoping I would be able to find something during this time. I'm a funny guy who enjoys a good laugh. I am very sociable, like to meet people and go out with my friends. Have only one criteria when judging people: they are either good and kind people or they are not. Everything else doesn't bother me. And that is it. Hope you got an idea of what kind of a person I am. Hope to hear from you soon!

I am sorry for asking you this but how much is the apartment? I would love you for the rest of my life if it's 800 dollars. I will take care of it for you and everything.
