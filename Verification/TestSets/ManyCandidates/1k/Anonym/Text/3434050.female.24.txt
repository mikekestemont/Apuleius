marathon and pig out on junk food and talk and stuff.  So that's what I'm expecting.   We go out to dinner.  We meet Zack.  He seems like a nice enough guy.  I'm reserving judgement.  Then it turns out Mandy is NOT coming over for the sleepover party.  Keep in mind that I have driven over two hours to see her, we have planned this for 2 months, AND Nelly and I have spent the whole week together.  We don't need to catch up.  We're caught up.  I wanted to spend time with Mandy.   Okay.  I can deal with the non-junk food binge.  I'm trying to lose weight.  We still have the concert on Sunday and possibly hanging out time on Sunday.  Wrong.  We call Mandy at around 3 to tell her that we are meeting at the tram stop for the Arena at about 6:30.  She says yeah she'll be there.  She is currently watching a movie with Zack.  Fine.  Then she calls at 6:30 as we are about to leave.  Guess what?  She can't go to the concert because she has work stuff to do.  Bullshit.  She was soooo doing Zack.  I was so mad.   So here we are, an hour before the concert with an extra ticket.  Nelly hangs up the phone.  I say "fuck it" let's just go.  I was steaming mad the whole way there, but then I told Nelly I wasn't going to think about Mandy anymore, I was just going to enjoy the concert.  We agreed to to just that.  Man oh man.  That concert was just.... AWESOME.  That's the only word I can come up with.  Saliva played first.  They did all the songs I like: Raise Up, Always, Click Click Boom, Rest In Pieces plus some from their new album coming out August 17.  I sang my little heart out on Always and Rest In Pieces.  That was just a warm-up.  Kiss comes out.  The place explodes.  Everyone is on their feet.  Everyone's screaming.  I screamed my lungs out.  I am actually whoarse today.  They started with Love Gun.  They did all the greats.  Detroit Rock City.  Unholy.  Got to Choose.  I Love it Loud.   Then during "I Was Made For Loving You", Paul swung out on this rope thing and got really close to Nelly and I.  He swung right above us.  I was going nuts.  I seriously was about to die I was so happy.  I wanted so bad to be able to hit a pause button and stay in the moment forever.  They ended the show with God Gave Rock N Roll to You and Rock N Roll All Night.  I was screaming the lyrics.  It was just such a great experience.  They had all kinds of pyrotechnics, confetti, blood, you name it.  There were people of all ages.  Probably 3 or 4 generations of people.  Past, Present and Future Kiss fans.  These guys have been doing this for over 30 years and they are still tearing it up.  If you ever get the chance to go, definitely do i
