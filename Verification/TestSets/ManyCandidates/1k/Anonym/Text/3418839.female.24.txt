I finally got to go to Medieval Times tonight...soooooooooooooooooo kick ass! And yes I was a muthafuckin' princess!!! I'm sooooo wearing my crown to work tomorrow!!! We had an awesome time! Of course my knight lost..but it's ok...cause he was the hottest knight in the place!!!!! hahaha. Anyways, the people who crapped out...you missed a good time! After that Sunshine and I jammed out to a different bar...Beemers..which was pretty kick ass. And I must make a point that...I BEAT HIM IN ONE GAME OF POOL!!!! yes, Mr. Pool Shark himself...I WIN!..again! yeah I rock! Anyways, i'm home now...sleepytime for me seeing how I need to be getting up early in the morn. to go play at FDU yet again. So until next time....
Tuesday was such an AWESOME day!!!! The day started out by Melissa Joe and myself gettin up early to drive down the shore.  We spent the day out on the beach at Sleezside.  The weather was beautiful and the ocean was even better!!!! No jellyfish and lots of shells!  Sunshine met up with us down there in the afternoon with enough time to check out the beach scene.  We played around on the boardwalk for a little while...along with some lunch/dinner and beers.  Then It was time for fishing!!!! We stocked up on beer and headed out to Point Pleasant to go bluefishing on the Norma K III.  Fishing was so fucking awesome.  BLOODBATH!!!! And yes, we deflowered Melissa, this was her first time fishing!  The two of us put ourself into the fishing pool before we headed out to sea.  Needless to say the two girls on the boat kicked all the guys asses and won the pool!!!!!Yeah that's right we fucking kick ass! Our fish was almost 11lbs.!!!!  Covered in scales and fish guts we got something to eat and headed home for much needed sleep.  We got back to Hackensack around 4-something in the am, showered and passed out.  One of the best night's sleep in a long time! Now today, I opted to not go to FDU and sleep instead!!! But it's ok...I'll be there tomorrow.  Tonight we are going to Medieval Times, but not before going to the Whiskey Cafe to pregame for a while.  I am finally getting to go to Medieval Times!!! I'm very excited.  For one day of my life...I will be a god damn princess!!!  I'm sure this day is only gonna get better!!! We'll just have to see what happens!
