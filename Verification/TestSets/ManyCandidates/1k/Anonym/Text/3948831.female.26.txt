Wednesdays though. I think mostly, I just like the familiarity of it. I like going in, seeing the same waitresses still there that were working there when we would frequent the place every night just a few short months ago. It's almost like "Cheers" for me. Not really, but it's at least my one "go to" place on the peninsula. Yeah, not everyone knows my name, but they probably vaguely remember our faces. That's not the point. The point is, I like The Brit. I like the Brit, and I miss hanging out and doing things in general.
Why is it, on the days that you just want to sleep in a little bit, it never happens? I went to bed at like midnight, kinda sad thinking of only the 6 hours and 45 minutes of sleep I was going to get after a very long weekend. But instead of getting every ounce of that time in, my body decides it wants up at like 5am or 5:30am, something like that. It's nuts. But I mean, there is only so long you can lay there in bed without getting up on mornings like this. Maybe my body just feels relieved Summer Camp is over and I won't have to see any kids until at least 2:30 this afternoon, maybe it knows all the stuff I have to do that I was honestly going to put off a few days and it's saying "wake up, wake up! you have too many things to do." I can't promise, but hopefully my will of wanting to relax will win over my body's natural reaction to want to bombard myself today. I also don't feel a bit guilty over that (okay, maybe just a little). In all honesty, I think that whole "Cycle of Vista Life" is starting to set in on me. I'm not sure what is supposed to be happening at the 5-6 month point, but I'm totally jumping on the "I work for less than minium wage and  you want me to do what? " bandwagon. Yeah yeah, I know, it's a good thought,  volunteering  for a year and all, serving my country, blah blah blah, and I'm really and truely one of the few Vista who can honestly say without cracking up that   I really like my job   and would venture to say that as far as Vista positions go, I got it made. I have a great position, I get to do fun things at work, and work with a great staff and supervisor. So yeah, for the most part, I come to work, ready to work because I love what I do and where I work. So what am I complaining for? I just want to sleep, thats all. That's all I've wanted since Day One in California. I want sleep until my alarm clock goes off on work days, I want to sleep past 10am on weekends. I'm tired of this getting up with the birds on the EAST COAST thing. Anyway, thats just how I feel this m
