to get blogger to cooperate with me regarding date formats and the correct time zone.  Hopefully I haven't managed to FUBAR my blog....
For some reason, I recently became convinced that my iBook was approaching its 3rd birthday.  When my power adapter died this weekend, I began reconsidering how long I've had it.  So I dug into my iBook records and checked the receipt... I bought it on 11/24/2002, so I've had my iBook about 20 months-- it's not quite 2 yrs old.  This seems important, primarily because I was thinking that my sweet little iBook was becoming a dinosaur... I mean, it performs excellently to this day (aside from the dead power adapter I had to replace today-- which had some cool side-effects-- see today's earlier entry)... but I was thinking that it was getting up there in the years, so far as technology lifespans go.  Anyhoo... while my iBook may be "middle aged," it's still a fresh-faced youngster to me ;)
I've been trying to get a part-time job to supplement my income... so that I can pay off my exisiting credit card debt... and perhaps one day actually have enough cash on hand to buy a REAL shower curtain ;)  So, this is interesting. This weekend, my iBook's power adapter decided it was its time to croak. The only thing worse than a laptop with a dead battery is a laptop with no way of charging the battery... or even running the machine. So, I checked out apple.com/store to see how much a new power adapter was gonna set me back... $79! Man, I love my mac, but it sucks when things break because it's expensive! Anyhow, I HAVE to get this power adapter because I have work I need to do on my iBook that's time-sensitive. So I figured I'd stop by my local Apple Store this evening... at Northpoint Mall.  Then, I realized something-- why not see if the Apple Store is hiring??! Apple, being it's super cool self, has a job search on its site... even for retail jobs. So, a few clicks later, I'd sent my resume to Apple for a Mac Specialist position at the Northpoint Retial Store. And I'm excited at the prospect-- this sounds like a part-time job that I could actually enjoy. An employee discount at the Apple store would rule, too.  Needless to say, someone from the Apple store called me this afternoon-- talk about turnaround!  I've got an interview on Wednesday for a part-time position.  I only hope that my somewhat limited availabilty (primarily weekends, holidays, perhaps a couple weeknights) doesn't pose too big of an issue as far as getting the job.  I mean, obviously I'm not concerned about my qualifications.  Frankly, I'm overqualified for the position, but that's the point in my seeking part-time gig.  I mean, it's certainly more appropriate than most of the part-time jobs I've been considering.  I really think it could be a fun job... it's the only position I've been really excited about in my recent search for a second job.  Here's h
