you hope in your final outcome.    Isaiah 55:8   God's thoughts are not our thoughts, & His ways are not our ways. We want what feels good right now, but God has something far greater in mind.   We are constantly trying to figure out something we do not understand or trying to make something happen now that is not happening yet. It seems as if we are always trying, but  believers are supposed to believe!   "Why, God, Why?" and "When, God, When?" can be two statements that keep us frustrated & prevent us from enjoying peace. Many times we do not understand what God is doing. But this is what trust is all about. Let God be God in your life. Give Him the reins. He knows what He's doing.   Trust yourself & everything to God who judges fairly & deals righteously. Deposit yourself in His hands & watch what He can do!   Wow...Amen to that! After what Bro Jeremy preached during CG last night made me felt even convicted about trusting God in the impossible.   Came across this earlier on:  Whether our dispute is a personal or a public matter, we quickly reveal whether we possess a servant's heart in how we respond to those who have offended us. We always have a choice. Will we choose to hold on to the things that have hurt us until we've erected monuments of spite that divide our once harmonious relationships . . . or will we choose to create lasting legacies of forgiveness by forgiving those that hurt us and then releasing the offense. . . canceling the debt? Don't miss those final words.we release people from the guilt and no longer hold the offense over their heads. When we choose to "cancel the debt," we unshackle people from the dark emotions lurking in our hearts that say, "Never. Never let this go." In fact, for those who have experienced life-altering offenses, choosing to forgive and release people can be an ongoing process.   When Peter asked Jesus, "Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? Up to seven times?" Jesus said to him, "I do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven" (Matthew 18:21-22).    Servants must be broad-shouldered people-big enough to go on, big enough to remember the right and forgive the wrong by releasing the offender of any guilt, pain, or grudges.   Knowing what I ought to do now certainly released me from the burden of worry & building up of hatred for this friend. Whatever it is, it's all up in God's hands who will decide what He'll do about this issue. I still believe that somehow God will bless me greatly about how I've handled this after struggling with it for sometime already.  I'm so thankful for being able to look upon God when I'm faced with problems in life & knowing that He goes thru every struggles in life with us.    La 3:24   I say to myself, "The Lord is mine, so I hope in H
