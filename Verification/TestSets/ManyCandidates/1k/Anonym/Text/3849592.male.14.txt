 (Cartman:)Hey, you're screwin' up my song Hey, What's goin' on  (Chef:) Come sail away Come sail away Come sail away with me chidren  Come sail away Come sail away Come sail away with me children  (Cartman:)No, no, no, no, like this, like this!!!  Come sail away Come sail away Come sail away with me (you guys can't here ya')  Come sail away Come sail away Come sail away with me (you guys seriously)  Come sail away Come sail away Come sail away with me (seriously you guys, screw you guys)  Come sail away(you guys seriously) Come sail away Come sail away with me (you guys seriously)  Come sail away(you guys seriously) Come sail away Come sail away with me (you guys seriously)     i know this song is what you call ancient but its just a funny song and i have a copy of the cd. i searched for the lyrics because i just put that song in my ipod and i cant understand the words. anyways, i tried to find the deeper meaning of this song and i think that cartman is trying to say, that one day we would have to leave our past and carry on. we need to set out for our future, trekking different paths and leaving our past. all our memories are only things that will inspire us to carry on.  althought we may miss the past, we should go on with our lives. and here in the song, although this is explained comedically, cartman described that the world is big and we should find our future on every shore. we shouldnt give up because we hit road bumps. and he said that the road is not an easy one. you will meet people and problems along the way but we must go on.  anyways, to make it short, we must persevere always. we cant be lazy at anytime although it is hard, we should. god made us into who we are right now, not to just lounge around. we should work for our good and the good of others.   heheheheh, i am now wondering how i made this song meaningful... wahahahhaha =)
tomorrow, we will meet our new adviser. air guinto is really leaving and we are all sad about it.  but, i accepted it already because, if he stays it will be awkward because he doesnt want to be our adviser anymore. he would rather have fa over us. well, he will still be our ap teacher and we will have a new teacher which i am sure that will love us as much or even more than sir guinto did.   anyway. i tried to think about the bright sidde about this and this came out..... "at least wala na maguutos sa atin ng sobra". am i mean or am i just honest. i really think that our lives would be easier without those requests and orders that sir gives out. i hope that whoever our new adviser is, i hope that he does not give out requests to often. =)) sorry sir guints! =
