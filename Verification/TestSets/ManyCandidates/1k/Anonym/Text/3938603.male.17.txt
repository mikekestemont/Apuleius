Like suicide's the only escape for the weary, admiration is the poison of choice for the soul.  Breathing's just a sliver of satisfaction, in this put-on world we digest. You're all made up and ready for your show, but you jest in your quiet, you're a bleeding heart like every fans you touch, and fame is just a word.  Live like a snowflake and be prepared to tango, it's a quick descent but you're dangerously unique. Wait until the dusk for a perfect sunshine, and pose for memory, this is as good as it gets.  And it sounds flimsy to say and all, but happiness is what you make it.
Bending and breaking, enigmas all their own -- unfairly connected, conjoined at the bone.

Whoever works, works in unknown ways. But like the beat of a drum, we follow lifes rhythm, and blame it on the wind, and blame tragedy, and luck and tuck away shame. Who we are, as people, is the definition of what we are, as beings.  Like the completion of a sculpture, the earth has molded together so well. The sky and grass reflect each brilliance towards the middle; the stage, the spotlight. If you find yourself searching for answers -- looking for love or victory or assurance, know that it first must be from you. It always shows in your eyes. Like animals, it is the sense we see and fail to recognize except in the pit of our stomaches. Like a great intuition, it is the lost connection, the missing piece to who you are, to who I am. The ability to control this emotion, like we control everything we breath.  In the pitch black a star is welcome, because even the sky hates to be alone.  And if you asked me "Who are you," now, I don't think I'd have an a
