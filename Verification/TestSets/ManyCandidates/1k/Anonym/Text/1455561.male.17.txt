 well here's some news: everyones just as nuts as you, possibly more so.  As for your lack of confidence, GET OVER IT, confidence is faked almost as easily as pleasant surprise is faked on christmas morning.  all you have to do is act it more than others.  if you dont believe me then think about an interview: you're scared as feck before but the second you walk in and shake their hand, you get on with it because sitting there in silence is not an option.  you idiot.  3) If you find yourself in a room with a bunch of screaming neanderthalic spongemonkeys (eg the big brother house) it's ok to choose to let them get on with it, and you can watch from afar as they create a cult to their new god akkyakyakakakak and construct a shrine to him using some cardboard boxes, lilt and a curly whirly (or whatever they do).  Not getting on with people is fine if they really arent your sort of person, chances are there are others there who dont like being made to worship at the temple of curly whirly who you can speak to.  However, dont speak too long, particularly if they start preparing the holy cress of ritual sacrifice.  4)get confident you psychosomatic little shit.  5)Are you just pretending to lack confidence to make you seem more interesting: the crazy neurotic guy who is quirky and loveable.  Well, you arent. it's like people who pretend to be hyper after drinking a minimal amount of fizzy drink as an excuse to generally annoy everyone and alleviate any responsibility because they were supposedly rendered incapable of reasonable thought by some sugar.  Are you diabetic? no? then surely you can cope.  get a grip.  6) If you have a serious problem with confidence, why are you reading this? do something about it.  If you carry on reading, i am only going to insult you further and thats not going to help, is it?  you ugly useless unbalanced joke.  you are too old as well.  and your hair looks stupid, all the time. loser.   Like i said, im not exactly world champion of confidence, but i am world champion of hypocracy, so there you go.  And before anyone gets upset, im not making fun of anyone here, Im insulting a reader, not anyone in particular.  You all know im only joking anyway.  well, joking some of the time .  ok, joking occasionally.  the bit about hyper fizzy drink sippers is true, they really annoy me.
I learnt the best party trick in the world last night in my martial arts class.  Take one plastic chop stick.  Place one end in to the soft bit of your throat.  Place the other into the palm of your hand.  Push chop stick into throat till it breaks.  Honestly, i can do this. Took a little bit of training last night so you shouldnt just try it without knowing what to do and how to do it as safely as you can.  All about chi apparently.
