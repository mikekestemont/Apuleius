online and chat with you one of these days. Who knows, maybe I can do it today. :)  &nbsp;
One would thing that being single and restless at the same time is a bad combination and I tell you - IT IS! What comes to mind though is that these single people who experience some sort of restlessness ends up doing something stupid or WILD in an attempt to assuage the feeling. But in my case, I was born tamed so no such wild thoughts sprung up to my mind. I guess some people are just born "behaved" *wink*. It doesn't mean though that I don't have any "wild" ideas of my own, it's just that I don't succomb to the temptation of&nbsp;doing something wild since&nbsp;I'm scared of things that are "un-doable".  &nbsp;  It's Friday and guess what? I don't even have any plans&nbsp;this weekend. What a pathetic&nbsp;life! I'm 27 and single for goodness sakes! If only I was a flirt, I would be out with some guy this instant, but I'm not and I'm not even sorry that I'm not. I don't wanna go through all that trouble of dating just for the reason of dating.&nbsp;Nways, Mel won't be around this weekend or on the next&nbsp;2 weekends after that&nbsp;so I guess I'm on my own for that duration.&nbsp;I'm not at all&nbsp;worried or grouchy about not going out. I'm just saving some energy for the mid-August. I'm planning on going out-of-town and going&nbsp;to some beach and&nbsp;be&nbsp;a bitch. hehe. I hope the weather won't be such a killjoy though.
Oh well, I'm just talking here about some nonsense. I better go and watch some ovie at the mall. Prolly eat a bunch of popcorn. I miss jan though. I don't know why I keep on missing him. I mean I miss him in the morning, at night, why watching movies, even right after we talked on the phone. It's kinda scary and pathetic. I just hope he misses me the same way or just plain misses me sometimes. I sound like a loser I wanted to cry! Waaaaaa... But no, I'm not gonna cry. I should count my blessings! I have a good-paying job and what else.... I'll&nbsp;save the rest to myself.
Gotta go!
P. S. I miss miss miss him soooooooooo much!
I am physically, mentally and emotionally tired! I'm sooooo not happy with how my life is going and I don't know how to fix it! I maybe stressed or maybe I'm starting to hate my dad, but no matter what, I just dont feel like going home. I also miss janu but he's so not here and I wanna call him but I just don't have the time and the means. It's sooooo expensive to call. I hope he'll drop me a line at this blog just to make me feel better. Anything will do or else I'll go crazy! I feel sooo alone!!!
Im actually using my mobile to do this blog and it takes ages to type! Oh well,im not complaining coz im happy i can do this anywhere and anytime i w
