how will Randy Orton react to be jumped by his supposed friends and mentors in Evolution. What direction will go? Who will his friends be? Will he even have any?  His character has so isolated himself with Hunter, Dave and Ric that to put him with anyone else after his antics with Foley, The Rock, HBK and Race among others would seem thoughtless. He can't very well team with Shelton and Edge will be a heel soon, but I'm tired of those two wrestling each other already. People are already talking about Randy possibly holding the title until Wrestlemania 21! I sure the fuck hope not, that's quite a bit longer than the Benoit reign and completely undeserved. I sort of hoped he'd drop the belt to Benoit tonight, but wishful thinking in today's Triple H structured WWE isn't right thinking. I see him possibly holding it through Survivor Series where he'll job it to Hunter or maybe Edge or whatever. Rumbles of Hunter vs. Randy at WM21 though, so who knows.        What will happen with the Kane-Lita marriage. The only way to find out is to tune in next week, huh!?  Will Lita go through with it? Will Matt Hardy show up? How 'bout HBK? He wants a piece of the Big Red Machine too! Maybe Marty Jannetty will show up, Rocker Drop Shawn and announce he's the real father of Lita's baby and he's full of Martyittude. Ya, never know.        Will Edge finally turn to the dark side? Will Christian return? Will he heel his brother or what? And when exactly will Shelton Benjamin return to the IC title picture?  I really thought Edge was going to job the title last night in Toronto to Batista with some Christian interference, but I was way off...it's only a matter of time though. There's a bunch of young dudes in the IC division, most are healthy now and aside from Trip and Regal it's a young man's game on RAW now. Kane is stuck with himself and the rest of the boys are just that...boys. Shelton will get a run with the IC gold soon I think, at the hands of a heel Edge which is a good enough reason to see Unforgiven where I bet he'll heel(get it?) on either Benoit or the World Champ himself under the right circumstances.       Will Rhyno and Tajiri get the gold?  I'd bet the house they do get the gold at the PPV, La Resistance - while entertaining - aren't as over as a nice run with Taj and Ry would be. They're both underused and need something. I wanted to see a Rhyno-Benoit World title fest but to n  o avail.       Find out all these questions and more next week, eh? I'll be back with random blurbs and shit and I've got some movie thoughts I want to get down in the next few days. Smackdown is of course Thursday - with a constant Bret watch in effect since Saturday. He could pop out of his gopher hole anytime now.     RAW Rating: 8
