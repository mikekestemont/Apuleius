now all I have is the practical and I am done!  Had waaay too much coffee yesterday, so when I got home about 11pm I was wired and couldn't sleep so I started my square for the yahoo group I joined. 2 people are matched up and they knit or crochet 1 or 2 6" squares for each other, when those are done you let the list know and they match you up with another person and you start again. Then you take all your squares and put them together to make an afghan or wrap or something. I started mine in Plymouth Encore in a raspberry color - I am making chris cross cables, I got the pattern out of  Beautiful Knitting Patterns by Gisela Klopper.  It is a fun way to try new patterns.
I handed my paper in last night - not my best effort, but at least it is finished and is in on time. Tonight I have my written final for Med Massage - I haven't studied - I just can't get my head wrapped around books - especially when all I want to do is wrap yarn around a needle!     This is the mexicali ole sweater I knit for my nephew - he looks wonderful in it. I think I have this picture thing figured out - yeah!!! More pictures to follow.  My mohair poncho is coming along really great - I love the effect I am getting. I can't wait till it is cool enough to wear.    This is the shawl I finished before the weather got really hot - it's done in Tahki bunny in violet.  Well I guess that is enough pictures for now, don't want to over load the page.
Happy Monday! Well my path paper is finished!!!! (well it is written, I just have to finish typing it today) I will hand it in tonight and the biggest part of my "things to do before I can graduate" list is done.  David and I drove the boys up to Boy Scout camp yesterday in the pouring rain. Of course I had to take a new project with me. I have one ball of King Cole Mohair in Barcelona (I think) it's teal, hunter, raspberry and yellow fuzzy yarn, and 2 balls of Woolease in Pines, which is a teal, dark blue and green mix. I cast on 76 stitches on size 17 needles with the mohair doing 3 rows of K1 *YO K2tog* then changing to the Woolease and doing about 4" of garter stitch then back to the mohair and so on. Gotta tell you, I am really please with the results - the colors set each other off perfectly and it feels incredible!. I am thinking I will keep knitting till I run out of yarn and if it is long enough stitch it up to make a poncho - otherwise it will make a beautiful shawl.  David still has not set up space on our ISP so pictures are not yet available, but are coming soon - I p
