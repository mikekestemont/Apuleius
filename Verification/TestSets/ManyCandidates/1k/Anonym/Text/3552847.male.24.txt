gratitude mean to the veterans.  i know i cant.  but its the least we can do.
Well let me be the first to welcome you all to August.  August is historically the worst month of the summer as this is when it gets really humid  and  really hot in the northeast.  The best part of August is that it leads us into September which I consider fall because I still mentally go by a scholastic calender.  Fall is the best season in New York by far.  I am sure to include Fall as an item in a blog coming up so please stay tuned.  1.  Jesus Candles.  I have been collecting these for a while and have some good ones.  My favorite candle is the Prayer of the Roses to the Virgin of Guadalupe. Let us pray: Oh Mother and Queen, Virgin of Guadalupe, how miraculously you appeared to the indian Juan Diego when You manifested your presence with divine roses.  Accept this candle with the perfume of roses, oh Guadalupana, a small offering of my devotion in order that my prayers and the sweet fragrance of roses may be brought to your divine son, our saviour, Jesus Christ.  Amen. ps.  this candle smells nothing like roses so I think I am lying to the Virgin everytime I recite this prayer.    2.  Pink Floyd's  I Wish You Were Here .  All I do is crave acid or mushrooms everytime this is on.  Very psychadelic and nice to listen to.  Please send acid or mushroom donations to 333 River St. #1149 Hoboken, NJ 07030.    3.  I dislike Harold Bloom's  How to Read Well and Why .  I'm not sure why I bought this but I think I remember Josh speaking about him...am I correct?  I'm willing to give this guy more of a chance but this book is so uninteresting.  It makes me not want to read which I think is the opposite response intended.  It consists of him giving felatio to Shakespeare and rehashing everything I heard from my proctors in college.  Maybe they were just rehashing this guy's shit but it still doesn't matter.    4.  Entourage week three.  This was very amusing.  Dillon had me laughing a few times this episode and I hope they continue his absurdness in the future episodes instead of his irrelevence in the previous two.  Next week I want to see boobs.  Come on, don't these kids go to strip clubs?  I know I would go every Sunday for brunch and have roast beef sandwiches if I had that kind of cake.  5.  Women with machine guns.  Wow, does this turn me on.  Thank you terrorists for helping me come to terms with my attraction to chicks with guns.  Tomorrow after work I am going to try to hit on the female national reserve guard outside penn station.  Wish me luck and please have your cellphones on in case I become and enemy combatant.    and that my friends is my post for the third day of Augusto.  Take care and I'll see you on the r
