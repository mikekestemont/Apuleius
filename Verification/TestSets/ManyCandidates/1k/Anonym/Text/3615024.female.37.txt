my mother did... Just loved me.  I still miss them terribly.... I still talk to my grandmother all the time... and I sometimes think I feel her presence with me... I can't believe it's been 18 years....
Update on the Feathers theme:  Three times in the past 10 days I have found feathers on the floor INSIDE my workplace... not down type feathers, but 4" - 5" regular feathers.... As I consider feathers to be messages, or signs, what do you think that means??
You know, it should be illegal for me to try and think when I'm tired. I get so pessimistic, and things bother me too much. Although, I consider myself a defensive pessimist. I don't expect things to work, then when they don't, I'm not disappointed. That is a hard habit to change, you know... I'm not sure, even, how to change it... I'm sure things are going to work out between R and I... I won't let it be any other way. I feel too safe with him... Starting another relationship, creating the trust, and getting to know another person from ground up would just take too much out of me, I think... R is safe, and he loves me. What could go wrong about that?? Plus, I guess it's better for our kids if we stay together...  ~*~*~*~*~*~ It's 102 degrees with a 36% humidity level... Would be nice if I had my air conditioning fixed... R keeps telling me that he can fix it, he just hasn't got around to it yet... Can't afford to pay someone to do it...
I realized this morning that I am scared to try again with R. The time we were together, my personality disappeared. It morphed into being a female carbon copy of his.  Also, his "lifestyle", (i.e. his slobbiness, his pack-rat mentality, his lack of self discipline) wear me out. It is like fighting a tidal wave with a teaspoon. It wears me out just thinking about it. I don't want to deal with all that again, although since he moved in here after getting his utilities shut off he has sort of taken over my home too... it isn't even close to as clean and neat as I want it, but I am sooo tired of fighting a losing battle... Is there even hope that this will work?? I am NOT changing my ways. Clean space is a necessity... and piles of dirty dishes in the sink, and dirty clothes in the living room are just not going to cut it with me... I don't ever seeing him being disciplined enough to "clean up" his act, either... *sigh* Do I sound like a broken record?? We really have not been apart much, although we have been officially seperated for 5 years... he keeps following me, and something always happens that I end up letting him move in... I think HE can't live without ME...maybe he is the dependent one, the submissive one.... I didn't take him on to raise, though...  Oh well... I don't know what the answer i
