permanent condition. Rather, it was brought on by a series of traumatic events that I refused to deal with. Namely, the death of my Uncle from AIDS, followed immediately by a career setback, topped off with the death of my grandmother on the first day of my second year of law school. All within six months.  Now in the Black community that I exist in, depression is a White problem. God forbid should a Black person go to a psychiatrist, or have to take medication. My entire life I’ve been told that if you are sad or upset, you should just “suck it up” or “get over it”; that I should “count my blessings” and move forward. But I learned that there is only so much you can “suck up”, there are only so many times you can “count your blessings” and there is only so much you can “get over.” An unfortunate side effect of this revelation is the knowledge there is a part of me that will always be ashamed that my pain became too much for me. My superwoman cape fell off and was replaced with a green bathrobe that I lived in for almost two months (don’t be alarmed, I kept it washed and pressed). I do consider myself blessed, however, because I have family who cared enough to worry when I didn’t call and who eventually tracked me down like “The Fugitive.”  So I took a semester off of school (not like I was going anyway), went on anti-depressants for a year (Paxil: it’s not just for social anxiety anymore), got psychological help, and dealt with the grief that was taking over my life.  The person I spoke to had also gone through a period of depression. And he asked me whether or not I sometimes felt myself sliding back into depression. I answered no, but after talking to him about it for a while, I did have to admit that I’ve seen changes in myself since then. The only way I can describe it is to compare it to a broken bone. Once you break your arm, you can get it set and it will eventually heal. But that bone will never be 100% again. It will always be slightly weaker. It will always be somewhat fractured. And that is where I am now. Because of what I went through I’m just a little weaker, just a little more exposed, a little more vulnerable. My soul knows its breaking point. And although I’m a little sadder for this, I’m also much wiser. And just a little softer around the edges.  Why the story? Well, with September 11th coming up, I realized that there are a lot of people out there like myself: fractured. And although this past year has allowed for a lot of healing, our country and the people in it will never fully recover. Our weaknesses have been exposed and we have become vulnerable. But this has also made us a little softer around the edges, and a little more caring for i
