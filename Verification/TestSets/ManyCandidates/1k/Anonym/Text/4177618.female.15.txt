that did it in the end.). The french class in which I became an open hypocrite, because I mentioned that I liked Dare You To Move, by Switchfoot, and he countered that he liked Meant To Live, by the same, better. I then turned to Carrie and said that yes, I preferred Meant To Live as well, but realized that I was becoming a hypocrite, and added that I wasn't sure how Dare You To Move went, as I had not heard it in a while, and Carrie sang a bit, and I said that yes, I liked that one too. The night before grad, when I asked him to save me a song. The grad celebration. The dance after the celebration, in which I danced with quite a few boys, and whenever I did try to find Kyle, he was either not there(as I found later), or had another partner already. He was popular, after all. The month that followed, containing me wishing I could tell him I liked him, him probably not being oblivious but acting it, as I am always blatantly obvious when I like someone, whether I want to be or not. The second last day of school, where I had my yearbook(grade eight's, because our school is stupid) with me, specifically so I could get him to sign it.

And if I didn't, it's only because of some sort of self-control I didn't know I possessed. I had hear that I'm going to "that school" or the "smart people school" or whatever else they came up with since May, which is when it became widely known. The thought still almost makes me cry. It's not like I want to leave them all... Seeing him and a bunch of other people in the mall, and not eating the rest of my hamburger until they went away(they took their sweet time, too.). The Pretty in Pink/ Ender/ Ten Second Epic show in the community hall. Him sitting on the other side of Adam while TSE played, singing along as if he were alone in the room. Heh. The most recent conversation, about who I am. He had forgotten again.  Yeah. That's not even all of them. Those are just the ones I remember right now.  I'm going to miss ESSMY. Why did I do this to myself?
So. I now have a blogger blog.  Goody.  I think I'll wait until tomorrow to dig into the angsting. I'm a bit tired, and I can't be bothered. *shrug*  And it b
