my mommy last night (its a show on MTV not a hoochie show...just incase you were wondering what is was Jessica) and she was laughing soooo hard, i dont think ive ever heard her laugh so hard, but they said a few bad words here and thurr so we had to turn it...made me sd cuz it was purty sillarious. i had a weird dream last night, but i dont think ill write it out in hurr. oh well, ill leave you guessing as to what it is. anywhoways, these last 2 days have been really boring for me, all i did was sit on my fat butt and gain 57 lbs. not really, i probably lost that much weight just by sitting. *siiiiiiigggggggggggh* caitlin, sorry i but i threw away the letter, i decided not to send it. jk i didnt throw it away, i waded it up and put it in my secret hidding place forever. well, thats about all the nonsense junk i have for you all today. byebye
thats right, caytie has cool hair, it is brown and cool (not crappy)...anyways, tonight was awesome cuz i got to see a good/muy coolio friend of mine...thats right...caytie. and i havnt seen her in a very looooooooooooooooooooong time. we saw "the village" and stuff. then we went into the elevator thing and we stood there for a couple minutes and it was not moving...turned out i forgot to press the button that said "1" on it or something like that. but it was a cool elevator cuz it had not 1, but 2 doors!!!!! i ve never seen anything like it before!!!! i was so excited! i ate skittles. ya, after the movie ended at 9 we waited for my mother to pick me up, but she didnt come so i called and she thought it ended at 920...silly mother...and then i got really fuzzy and started feeling numb in my face, arms, legs stomach, and later on my tongue. and i was scurred. then i ate skittles and felt better. so im thinking my blood sugar was low, which is weird because last time i was tested, i wasnt diabetic, so i dunno whats up with me...probably my body being retarded again...DONE  caytie, lets not wait a whole year before we see each other again...stay cool (just like your hair)
