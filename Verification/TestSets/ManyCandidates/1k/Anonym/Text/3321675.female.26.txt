that they could see me with my hands in my pockets or rather, reading the newspaper.   My feeling about all this is, why put someone from another store in my store when the store already has someone who can run it just fine...if not better than Kevin.&nbsp; We'll never know I guess.
For the past couple of days, I've come to believe why used car salesmen have such a bad rap. In a previous entry, I stated that we had just purchased a Rodeo. Well, on Tuesday, Giles Motors, the dealership, repo'ed the vehicle. When I called about it, I was informed by Nancy, the salesperson, that "my husband is a lying sack of shit and I don't have a chance on God's green earth ever getting my Rodeo back." Now, under different circumstances I would have gone off on this woman. But, I was so shocked that she took my vehicle that all I did was hand the phone to my husband and told him to call her back and handle it. Nancy told us that Chris had stolen a blazer from her company a few years back and now we won't be able to get ours back because of it. Chris has this little habit when it comes to vehicles...pay for it outright, make no payments. That was until now, I figured that hey we'll get a vehicle and start building our credit at the same time. So, with this info, we both know that it's not Chris who supposedly "stole this blazer". And besides, she "can't find the paperwork on the blazer to give us in order to fill out an identity theft report on." Which makes me wonder...is trying to build a file to say that it was him. Make up a place that said that he lived there and forge his driver's license. If that's the case, she's going down. Tomorrow, I'm going to talk to an attorney about the whole situation. Hopefully we'll be able to get something done on that end. Plus, I'm truly hoping that my bank will give us a loan so we can buy this vehicle outright from Giles Motors and take them out of the loop. Seeing as how she won't release the vehicle on grounds that the Bank she uses won't allow her to release it. So, if I can bypass Giles and hoping that the vehicle isn't "hot" I'll have my vehicle back by Monday. When this all went down, Chris had to take the night off so I could go into work. He can have someone cover his shift, there isn't enough people working at job to do that. So, we lost over a hundred dollars in just one night...plus maybe even the vehicle. So, here I'm sitting wondering what else I can do to get this vehicle back. I'm even thinking about a lawsuit for slander against Nancy for what she had said about Chris.  NO ONE TALKS ABOUT MY HUSBAND THAT WAY BUT ME!!! And especially not someone who doesn't even know him. She's going d
