it now. I guess saying that makes me sound like I'm complaining about how miserable I am, but I'm really not - I'm just, well, bored! The title of the site is actually fairly misleading - making boredom fun is not really possible, cos once you start having fun then you're no longer bored, so it's not boredom, so all you've done is kind of  kill  the boredom, so when it comes back it isn't fun anymore, and then...OK, basically, the stupid website insisted that I come up with a title, and I'm shit at things like that, hence the aforementioned misleading title. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to change it, but if I am then rest assured I will do so as soon as I think of a better title. If I  do  change it then none of what I just said will make any sense, but that's life.  See? Boring! Even I admit that that whole big fat paragraph up there is utterly BORING!  So what is this thing? I guess it's kind of a diary, but it isn't really - well, the ones I've read before seem to be quite different to most people's diaries, although I guess that's understandable. Who the hell would put their diary on the  internet , for a load of freaks to gawp at? Certainly not me. Anyway, past attempts at keeping a diary have been somewhat less than successful, which is what makes me think that I will give up doing this thing after a few days. Ah well, let's see how far I get!  I've just realised that although I set up this whole stupid website thing, and just wrote all that, nobody but me actually knows how to get to this, or even knows what it is. So, if you're not me and you're reading this, hi! You are either:  A) Someone who types in random names into this thing and, by chance, came up with mine. I'm flattered that you've read this far without actually knowing who the hell I am, but I also think you're kind of sad.  or B) This one is infinitely more likely - I decided to tell people how to get to this site, so they can read whatever shit I feel like  writing as and when I please. Oh my God, I finally have a proper site to put in the "my website" bit of my MSN profile! I will do that now to increase the chances of somebody actually reading this - if you do so, please leave a comment in the comments thing (dunno where else you would leave it) so I know you're there!  It's just struck me how fucking sad this thing is, but it's also kind of fun, and I prefer typing to writing, so I think I'll carry on with it.  Bye for now (even though there's nobody reading this except me, so I'm saying bye to myself, which is ridiculous, unless I was about to die, and I don't think I am (touch wood)) D
