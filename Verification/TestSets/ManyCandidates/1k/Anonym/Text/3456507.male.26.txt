Fruit Market of the South" is great for grapes, mangoes and guavas.

Because of its rich stone resources, Bangalore is also known as the "Stone City", for its granite deposits.  God knows ... will I enjoy hear ???
Recently, Rogers Cable Inc. and Yahoo! Inc. unveiled what they call a “new integrated broadband experience.” Combining high-speed Internet with a large suite of services like news, music and videos,  yahoo.rogers.com  is designed to provide a media-intensive trip for ‘Net addicts and media junkies.  The Rogers-Yahoo site features an email system with anti-virus and spam protection; 2 gigabytes of email storage; unlimited storage space for uploading photos; a messenger service; an intricate system of parental controls; and music, videos and games. This incursion comes one month after Bell Canada introduced a similar co-branded Web portal,  Sympatico.MSN.ca , with Microsoft Canada Co. However, both these new portals don’t come free: To use the yahoo.rogers.com portal, you must be a subscriber of Rogers’ high-speed Internet services to use the perks, and Sympatico.MSN.ca demands that users pay for premium services. Looking beyond the fine print, it becomes obvious that these two converged giants are looking to capitalize on this growing Web trend, and are working to shape an “if you build it, they will come” corporate strategy. The creation of these two new portals also suggests a new generation is being born from the information superhighway.  In the early days of the Internet, consumer demand called for speed and a stable connection. Now, with broadband connections being far more common (especially in Canada), the name of the game has become content. The current generation downloads everything, so it was only a matter of time before corporate think tanks would start churning out ideas to capture this growing market.
Dear Reader,   My guess is that the listing would be  @ 1200  or more, because there will definitely be a huge demand from Mututal Funds for additional quantities. TCS will soon be a major component of indices and every MF will want to have TCS to have an average weightage of  5 %  in their portfolios to match with Infosys and Wipro. They sure have already bought some but will buy again after listing, as they have a tendency to buy in lots periordically as they generate cash, with a wait an watch approach. This demand will have a chain reaction later by way of demand from Foreign Institution and then lastly from retail investors. All the retail investors who invested now are lucky, but they should still be carefull and keep watching it continuously for price movement and book profits periodically if rises above 1250. Otherwise in any case it is a sureshot long term bet. You can keep it for your children. They will make a fortune. It has the potential to become a Microsoft. The Company's strategy is to be among the world's top 10 Tech firm by 2010.       Saurabh B
