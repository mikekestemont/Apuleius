(7 years now) I awake my sweetie with a special breakfast. For some reason the tradition became turnovers. This year it was apple turnovers. Such a lucky guy :-)  Tonight we are celebrating just the two of us with family on Friday and friends on Saturday. I have a big presentation tomorrow for my Accounting course so tonight he will be lucky enough to hear my portion 7 times. Was told in a communications class that to be prepared for a presentation a person must practice 7 times.  Because of school I have not really started the CPA studying. The assignment for this week is two chapters. I plan to do this on Saturday and Sunday. However, I am reading the practical advice section and learning a lot on how the test is scored. For example, I did not know that missing a multiple choice type question does not reduce your score. Getting the correct answer simply raises it. For this reason they say to answer all questions, even if you have to guess.  Did I mention that I cannot wait until the semester ends?
While I was sick I registered for the Bisk CPA review. That was an interesting conversation with my voice almost gone completely. The review started yesterday. It is on-line with instructor led assignments over the course of 7 weeks. I think this is going to be very good for me.  Interesting thing is that they do refer to the prep time for the CPA as studying. Instead they call it "training". In fact I was reading the hints and general information last night and a lot of the information sounds like what I read as I prepared for my half marathons. I suppose I am preparing for a marathon of sorts. This helps since I know that I was able to complete two half marathons with my training and determination.  Hard to believe only 40.5 weeks until graduation
Last week I was sick - hence the lack of postings. Last Monday I was not feeling good at all, Tuesday was much worse with me barely making it through the day. Wednesday I awoke to barely a voice. I even went to the doctor. That is pretty sick. Sinus infection. It was bad. Missed three days of work. I made it to work yesterday but the normal daily activities wore me out. I am still not at 100%. My focus now is to get to 100% and then focus on staying healthy. I plan to sleep 8 hours a night - this is an important one for me, eat my fruits and veggies, and do some form of exercise daily.  This week is a stressful one, but exciting.  Tuesday - Accounting Group meeting Wednesday - my Sweetie's b-day Thursday - Accounting Group Presentation - end of this horrible class Friday - Family celebration for my Sweetie Saturday - LAN party Sunday - Marketing Group Meeting  I am counting the days until the end of the semester, 7 until everything is due, 9 until last class.  Then two wonderful w
