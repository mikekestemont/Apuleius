All They Had Was Jeans &amp; Crappy Shirts! After I Got Done Shopping For Clothes At The Mall We Went Over To Kohls (Probably Not Spelled Right) And I Got Some More Clothes! After That We Headed Back To El Dorado To Go To Wally World! At Wally World I Got Some Undies (Box Briefs And Boxers For Those Who Want To Know), Socks, And Some Basic School Supplies! It Is Kinda Hard Shopping For School Supplies In HS Since You Don't Find Out What You Need Until The First Day! I Ended Up Just Getting A Notebook, Mechanical Pencils, And Pen- I Already Have A Binder &amp; A Calculator! After That I Came Home, And Here I Am Typing To You! GoodBye!
I Was Typing A Post, And It Screwed Up So This One Is Going To Be Short! I Didn't Do Much Today, I Cleaned The Living Room, Played With Silver Ryan, Watched TV, Played On The Computer, And Finished All The Laundry! Tomorrow I Am Going School Clothes Shopping, Kewl... No, Horrible....Yes!
Well....I Got Silver's Caged Cleaned, Worked A Little On The Laundry, And Watched TRL, Yeah, I Got Everything Done! I Recently Figured Out Our New Neigboors (We Live In A Apartment, They Live On Top Of Us) Are College Students, And So Far I Can Tell There Are Going To Be Atleast 3 People Living Above Us.

I Have Plans To Watch TRL @ 4, Work On Getting The Laundry Done, And Cleaning Silver's Cage.... After That, Its Back To Doing Nothing! I Think I Will Go And Clean Silver's Cage Know! Oh And BTW, It Feels HOT Today, It Is Only 91 (91 Is Hot, But Better Then 100), But It Feels Like It Is 100 Or So, To Hot For Me!
Today I Am Finally Back Home After Another 2 Hour Long Drive, I Am So Sick And Tired Of Being In A Vehicle It Isn't Funny. If You Can't Tell I Kinda Did This Last Weeks Monday-Thursday Blogs Today, I Just Changed The Date So It Would Appear I Wrote Them On The Date On Which The Events Occured. I Come Home To Find We Have New Neigboors On Top Of Us And They Are Being A 'Lil Loud, Ok, That Are Being Way To Loud! I Only Got 49 EMails From When I Was Gone, I Figured I Would Have 100 To 150! My Gerbil (Silver Ryan) Surivived The Week W/ Me Being Gone, I Was Happy To Find He Survived, But I Know Deep Down He W
