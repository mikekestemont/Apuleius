people who are passionate about their sports and not about the spoils of their talents. If they want to go pro after competing so be it, let them make their money. Capitalism. As for the Olympics, let's keep it amateur; let's do it for the spirit of competition. Competition ISN'T the Dream Team embarrassing the Chinese Basketball team... speaking of which the American coverage of those games are&nbsp;hilarious. The commentators keep referring to 'American Basketball supremacy'... [ TANGENT TIME] LOL, China isn't a 'basketball country'. Lets have a new Olympic games... "The Math and Science Olympics" lets pit American highschool youths against Chinese elementary students. The Chinese would kill. That's not important, what's important is sending over Professional NBA stars to affirm American power. It's Like Korea or Vietnam all over again. We know you're the best USA. We all know.  The competition is dead, for we dunked on their heads.   Money already owns pro sports, lets go for amateurs instead....  What can we do? Well, lets watch the water polo, lets follow the fencing and peek in on the pole vaulting, cheer for your table-tennis tandem, support your amateur athletes, support the true spirit of the Games and don't watch the commercials, because if you do, we might see athletes representing Nike instead of the Netherlands and Adidas instead of Austria.  Let's not let it get that bad.  -Fadniz   Questions? Comments? Raving Disagreements?   [  urlLink fadniz  ]
I got this string of emails from a friend of mine who works in the government. She sits in a cubicle  next  to recipient/responder. It cracked me up. The kicker is the last line of the email.  When did we become so oblivious to the people around us? When did work turn us into robots who come in, stare at a computer screen all day, and leave without any sense of human contact? We send emails to people who can hear us typing them, and who don't even know we exist.  I changed the names so that she doesn't get in shit, but between you and me, what the fuck?   -----Original Message----- From: Matherson, Marie  Sent: Thursday, July 22, 2004 3:35 PM To: Forsythe, Tom Subject: web site?
