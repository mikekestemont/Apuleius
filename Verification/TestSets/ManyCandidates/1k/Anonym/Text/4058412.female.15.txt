and it dragged on forever, and then the ending was full of action and drama. it also made me want to kill myself.  you know on star world, they have those advertisements for movies. they would put the actor's/actress's name, and then underneath that they'd put the name of their character in quotes. does anyone notice that they do this for the director as well. like, Shawn Levy, "director". or maybe i was just hallucinating. or maybe the people at star world really don't like shawn levy. i need a new handkerchief.
okay so i've just had something extremely traumatising happen to me. well not JUST, it happened at 3am. i was hungry and i found this weird mudpiecake thing in the fridge so i stole that, and then after a bite, i discovered a weird gooey long thing in it and i've concluded that it was a rat tail. it was horrible! like all long and yellow and there were weird bubble things at the end. i almost puked everywhere but i didn't anyway. so yeah, i'll never be eating any form of dessert anytime in the near and distant future. *yechhhh*      so now we're going to singapore on the 17th for a week. i can't wait to go and raid hmv of all their cds and posters. but then i doubt they would have like half of the cds i want because they are idiots who don't stock up on nice cds. but i still have a week to go hunting over all of spore. AND THEN AFTER THAT I CANNOT WAIT TO GO TO AUSSIE AND GET MUGGED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WOOO \m/SUCKONTHAT\m/.
I GOT MY LIP PIERCED! OHH YAhhh babyyy!!!!!   I GOT MY LIP PIERCED! I GOT MY LIP PIERCED! I GOT MY LIP PIERCED! I GOT MY LIP PIERCED! oohhh GCSE results out on the 10th? thats bulll!! they cant mark them that fast... stop kicking up a fuss!
hello mofos. it turns out right that our igcse results are being released on the      10th      and not the 26th because they are stupid retards who only know how to ruin my life. i had this fool-proof plan of staying in the empire a few days before the exams came out and on the day they did, well there was a nice big sea for me to drown in. but noooo they had to mark it quick so that i wouldn't be able to enjoy the rest of my holidays bloody british. now i'm worrying about whether or not my parents will send me to aussie, because they only will if the results are to their SATISFACTION i.e. A*A*A*A*A*A*A*A*A*and C for malay. i considered running away, but then i realised i couldn't do it at night because the security guards prowl around the grounds and lurk outside the house, and i couldn't do it in the daytime because there are more people prowling and lurking. i will lock myself in my room until i rot and die, because that is easier than facing parents with igcse r
