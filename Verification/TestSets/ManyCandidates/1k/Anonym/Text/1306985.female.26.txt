If it were a real date, the both of you would want real food and a place where you could really talk things  through. Don't go out with a guy to a movie on Friday night if you're really serious about him. Going to a movie is more like treating him like a "filler" just because you had nothing to do on a Friday night so you might as well go out. Topic. Ha! You wouldn't be talking about chikang artista, chikang opisina or argue if the one girl's boobs are real or not. You would be probably talking about sensible, quite personal stuff.  &nbsp;  */I therefore conclude that platonic relationships are never complicated; people just have tendencies to complicate them./*&nbsp;  &nbsp;
u can't make people love you--we all know that. but we can love ourselves the way nobody else can, & that's the most wonderful thing  when you're stressed & overwhelmed, turn to people around you. value your friends. hold on to fun & loving moments that make life worth living.  we will always encounter challenges that make us feel less than we really are. what matters is that we can pick ourselves up.  the darkest hour is the best time to see the stars. it is when life seems most harsh & painful that the most wonderful blessings arrive.  follow your hopes & dreams. some opportunities come once in a lifetime. it's better to try than always wonder wat could have been.
(They Long To Be) Close To You Carpenters   Why do birds suddenly appear Every time you are near? Just like me, they long to be Close to you.  Why do stars fall down from the sky Every time you walk by? Just like me, they long to be Close to you.  On the day that you were born The angels got together And decided to create a dream come true So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold And starlight in your eyes of blue.  That is why all the girls in town Follow you all around. Just like me, they long to be Close to you.  On the day that you were born The angels got together And decided to create a dream come true So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold And starlight in your eyes of blue.  That is why all the girls in town Follow you all around. Just like me, they long to be Close to you. Just like me (Just like me) They long to be Close to you.
