be filled up the way they are? What if they understand on some level that if I were to smoke I would be less emotionally available to them?   I have never nagged a person about smoking. And I have never been the type to refuse to buy cigarettes on the theory that to do so is to aid and abet another's destruction. I allow people to smoke in my home and in my car. My attitude has always been that I value the person and want that person to comfortable when in my company. I have never disqualified a person as a potential friend because of smoking. Being around a smoker doesn't bother me.   But now, in light of this new perspective, I find myself thinking about it somewhat differently. What if the emotional distance I feel from my partner is caused because he smokes? Will he ever be able to (or choose to) make more internal space for me? If smoking fills him up inside, will there ever be room for me?
The spell lingers and every mundane touch evokes comparison, whispers of you.  Resting by the street, I settle myself into the wooden contours of a sagging bench and feel it waken, forsaking decades of jaded indifference. Its arms and legs are yours and so I sit a while, savoring the embrace, public in its privacy.  Sunlight finds the shoulder still dusted with your breath and my skin quivers, alive in reverie.    jcr/8/7/04
I want no more things to bind me! All this stuff much too narrowly defining me!  Wife. Mother. Child. One day soon I will just go wild from knowing I cannot get free.  I want to listen to the sea... to catch my thoughts in poetry and vent my fury when its riled. I want no more things.  I want to wander endlessly, marvelling at eternity. I want to lose myself, beguiled by that which was before reviled. Dancing through the stars, joyously... I want no more things.   jcr2003
Strength to Share  Hope flies all around and through me. It's magic in the air: more real than wishes made for free, or even pious prayer.  Hope shows us how we long to be: dancing the way we dare, our souls as open as the sea, released from needless care.  No way to prove what you can't see, believing makes it there, flying all around and through me, giving me strength to share.   jcr2003
"When a trout rising to a fly gets hooked on a line and finds himself unable to swim about freely, he begins with a fight which results in struggles and splashes and sometimes an escape.  Often, of course, the situation is too tough for him.  In the same way the human struggles with his environment and with the hooks that catch him.  Sometimes he masters his difficulties; sometimes they are too mcuh for him.  His struggles are all that the world sees and it naturally misunderstands them.  It is hard for a free fish to understand what is happening to a hooked one."  ~ Karl A. M
