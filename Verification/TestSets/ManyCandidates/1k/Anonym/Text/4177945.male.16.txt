Me,angeline,frawley,jun xiong,joanne,  amy  and  bee leng  went to  City Link Mall and Suntec City  as the gals wanted to shop... but we went to eat  KFC  first before shopping.. haha the gals esp  Amy  took a long time in each n every shop they went to...  me   n   jun xiong  had a 'wonderful' time waiting.. haha.. but it was fun.. seeing the gals trying on clothes.. they all look very chiobu.. haha.. the shopping spree ended at 8pm as most of them was tired by then.. so we all went home by MRT except  bee leng  who took a bus.. damn tiring day... but an enjoyable one too.. n btw, about the strawberries that i bought for that girl yest, i didnt give her coz i was to scared that she'll be shocked to death and i'll be embarrassed.. once again.. i failed to show my sweet gesture..  Loser .. i feel that something is holding me back.. feel like i'm not suitable for her coz she's soo high-class.. but i still wanna try..  lets see as time goes on .....
