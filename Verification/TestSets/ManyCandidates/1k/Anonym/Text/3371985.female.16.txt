asked me to wait at the Mercury Drugstore there.     AND LOOK WHAT ENTERTAINED ME WHILE WAITING!!!!    Maid in Manhattans having an EB! I can't picture the look on the girl's face. Either she's just   shy   or   nadidismaya   sya. (i am guessing its the   later  . hehe =þ) The guy looked like a   kargador   at greenhills. (im soooo sorry for being a laitera,its just part of what i really am..)  Anyways they decided to leave just in time, Rosa Isabel came!  (Haaayy..sa wakas..)  HaHaHa  We went to   TUP   to look for her mom. Kukunin kasi namin yung perang pambili ng libro nya. E paalis yung mama nya,so we went to SM Manila muna.   (im tired and im not in the mood to tell what happened..maybe next time..or look at Rosel's blog if she wrote it there na.)  Basta pinuntahan kami ni Jeff dun sa 7-11 sa Morayta. Nakita kami. Umuwi na ko.  OK  On the ride home may nakasabay akong mga jologs.    WHY JOLOGS?!?    I know..I know masamng manglait..pero totoo naman e.  There were 8 of them. 6 guys 2 girls.  Nakakairita sila.  Let's start with the two girls:  One looked really trying hard to be pretty, but she isn't. She's just payat. Gawd!   WALA NGA SYANG @ NGIPIN SA HARAP E!   Nakakahiya! Ang daldal pa naman nya! She was arguing with her boyfriend. According to her may invisible barrie daw sa gitna nila. WHATEVER!  The other girl was malandi. She was hitting on the guy,who looked 25+ years old (i suppose they're 17-19 years of age.),beside her. She wasn't doing a very good job.  AND YOU KNOW WHAT I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THEY HAD TO BRING A ROLL OF TOILET PAPER! (WALA BA SILANG PANYO?!?!)  ok dun naman tayo sa lalake.  Namention ko na yung 2  yung 4 pa..  i have nothing againts the two guys at my right side.they were tahimik.  PERO YUNG NASA KALIWA KO ANG EPAL!  Trying-hard Wannabe-Rappers! (oohhh..Jam* Hates guys like these! haha =þ)  What's more irritating is that may sumakay sa 2 matanda..An old lady sat between the two girls. Still nagaaway pa din si feeling-pretty girl and her gwapo-wannabe boyfriend. Finuck-you yung girl nung guy, and of course magrereact sya    KNOW WHAT THE REACTION WAS?!?      "TANGINA WAG M KONG GANYANIN HA!"    Sobrang nakakahiya sila..haayyy..ako yung nahihiya para sa kanila e..T_T    NIKEI's MOOD FOR THIS DAY:  HAPPY!  kase..basta! hahaha    *: Jeff=Rosel's boyfriend Raymond=Rose's bro Jam=Jrock from friendster!ü
