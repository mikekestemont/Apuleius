Thursday, and Jen says I suck at it.  So this is for Jen's pleasure.  DONG.  This weekend was rather mellow for me, my children.  I did, however, reunite with Brother Jimmy's on Friday evening.  I did not get kicked out, cut off, or even blackout.  Mel and I are proud of ourselves for not letting ourselves get out of control.  They must of missed us because my bill was either $14, $16, or $18... Im not sure exactly what it was because apparently on my cab ride home on the phone with Matt i quoted many different prices... Oh well, it was a deal and Im all about that.  I have painted my apt. my friends.  Mel and I braved the humidity on Sat. and went to B, B and B (Bed Bath and Beyond).  Mel needed an AC and I needed some hoot new curtains and a dish drainer.  People in stores are annoying... they are even more annoying when the humidity outside is more than 90%.  All I remember is some old bitch in lime green pushing our shit out of the way to get to the ATM machine which she didnt even know how to operate.

Of course I hoped that neighbor Melissa who has a spare set of keys would be home, but no... she's at the boyfriends getting boinked.  At least someone was happy.  I debated on knocking on doors to see if i could climb out a neighbors window but it was 8am and I didnt want to wake anyone.  Then the genious in me struck-- "Go to the roof and climb down, Jim... thats a grand idea..." I say to myself.  I did just that.  Its pouring at this point and I have hardly any clothes on and really bad shoes...  I heaved myself over the ladder on the roof and began my descent down to my second story window.  I think people saw me pass their window, and I simply told myself they were lucky to see an ass like mine first thing in the morning to make myself feel better in the situation.  Finally, I got in.  Then I began to paint... ALL DAY.  It was a project, but it paid off.  I think Im going through paint fume withdrawl today, though.  I'm debating on going home and licking the w
