city. Driving was slow especially with the bad road but we had no idea since it wasn't raining when we drove from Bacolod. But before we came here, we visited Pio's grave at Rolling Hills Cemetary. It's always saddens whenever I go there but I try to be cheerful and be thankful for the gift of life. Anyway, traffic was bad especially that it's peak hour. I was so nervous about my driving but thankfully I get off from there... hehehe... It seems like a long way coming here but at long last we arrived around 11a.m. here.
here i am sitting in JRS internet cafe, it's sunday around 3:35pm in the afternoon. too many events has happened in my life since i came to bacolod. saturday 4a.m., as i sat in the bus waiting for the time to travel to bacolod city, i recalled the happenings the night before and recalled that i had a great time with my girlfriends. we ate at Shakey's and boy we really had a great time eating cheese pizza, mojo's and shakey's combo meal. lots of laughter and fun. afterwards, we went to see a movie, "Ella Enchanted". Anne Hathaway is really fit to be a princess. the movie was funny, enchanting and had a little bit corny on the side. hehehe =) as usual, after the movie we went to East West to have some drinks and later on went to Time Zone to play Daytona's Car Racing. I was 1st place 2 times in a row...        the whole trip going to my parents' was a blur. i was asleep the whole time except for the occasional stopover where we ate our breakfast. around 12:30pm, i met with my cousins Diane and Angela as I got off from the bus. my parents weren't there to meet me since they have a Braveheart meeting at Bacolod pavillion from 8-5pm. Lunch was great since Mama prepared my favorite foods,i.e. adobong manok, shrimp, tinoling manok. It was nice eating foods prepared by Mama... =) In the afternoon, I spent it mostly sleeping until it was time to meet Pio's family to have dinner. It's Nang Ging2x's birthday and I invited them to dinner together with my family. We ate at Buto't Balat. It's the usual filipino cuisine, there's some Lechon Kawali, Sinigang na baboy, bulalo, camaron rebosado and fried chicken. unfortunately, Daddy and Mommy(Pio's parents) weren't able to come due to car trouble and bad health. still it was fun seeing Ng Ging2x and Ng Neneng. We haven't seen each other in months.       Sunday... I spent it sleeping again and around 12noon, my cousins and I went to Bacolod Pavillion to watch my parent's dance the Rigodon dance, part of the program of Couple's for Christ. They were great. Unfortunately, they only got second place but I don't know why they lost. Around 2:30pm, we went home but we got off in Robinson's to do some shopping. We dine out again and ate at Robinsons till it's time to go home. It was a great week... =
