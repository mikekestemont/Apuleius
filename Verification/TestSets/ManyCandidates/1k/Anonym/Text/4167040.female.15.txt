in God...because he's real      Did you know that Jesus loves you? Yes      The Future . . . (dramatic "oohs" and "ahhs")       Do you have it all planned out or are you just going to take life in stride as it comes? A little bit of both...but mostly take life in stride as it comes      When do you get out of school? Um...when I'm 18      Excited? Yea, it will be nice    What are you going to do this summer? Well, my summer is almost over...I hung out with friends, went to movies, slept in...      What grade are you going into? 10th      Are you going to move away as soon as you’re out of school or stay where you are? I guess it depends      So do you know what college you’re going to, or if you’re even going to college? Nope       If you are, what do you think your major will be? I honestly don't know      Do you plan on getting married, provided that you meet the right person? Yes      If so, do you want kids? Yes      If yes, how many? 2      Tearful Goodbye . . . (sniff sniff)       What more important, more practical thing could you have done instead of filling out this survey? Um...nothing else really, lol...      About how long did it take you? Almost a hour, lol      Was it worth it? Kind of, because I'm bored      What are you going to do now that it’s over? Talk on the phone with my best friend      I guess it isn’t over yet, is it? I guess not...
Hey. My 2nd entry of the day. How exciting. My Xanga is a little messed up right now but I'll keep writing in that too because that has like records of everything I have gone through. Jeff is over right now and he's sad because he doesn't have a dog...and the only dog he owns...he shot with a tranquilizer gun. Anyway...I'm all happy now. Michael finally called me...and he wasn't suppose to, but he did anyway...lol, well that's Mike for you all. Jeff and I have just messed around the whole time. We even drew in our driveway with chalk! It was lots of fun, people thought we were retarded though...lol. I've also tipped my computer chair over twice so far...lol. Well, I guess that's all for tonight. Luv yall.
Today just feels crazy. Yesterday I was so happy...and today it's totally opposite. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm still happy...I guess today is just not my day. I really don't know why either. I guess I just have a lot on my mind with starting school, tryouts, acupuncture, possibly getting my wisdom teeth out this up coming week, registration...and not one of those things I want to do. I wish I was able to just live a free and normal life...do what I want to do, but I guess everything happens for a reason. I'm waiting for Michael to call today...he said he would, so he should. Well...I guess I have nothing more to say...so I hope everyone that reads this has a great d
