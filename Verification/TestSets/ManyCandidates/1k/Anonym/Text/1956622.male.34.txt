how she spent the day at Sarah's and how there were a bunch of kids there.  Today being Tuesday and the day before school starts it kind of makes me wonder if she is really visiting Sarah who works as a nurse or if she is going to some kind of day care or something while   SFW   does whatever or whomever in search of money for her attorney fees.  Regardless talking to Karissa lately has been extremely pleasant and a lot of fun.
Karissa and I talked today although it was not a long talk.  She spent a lot of time talking to Uncle Martha.  When I told her Miss Debbie was coming over she was very excited but I had to tell her she would have to wait til next week to see Miss Debbie.  Other then that the day was pretty uneventful.  With school taking up most of my evening.
Karissa called and she started by telling me about her day at the beach and how many sea shells she found, of course no day at the beach would be complete without sand castles.  She also told me the water was freezing.  I apologized to her for putting ice in the water and she giggled at that.  Simply saying you were at home so you did not put the ice in the water.  She asked me to play I spy with her.  I said you silly we can't play I spy you are at your house and I am at my house.  Karissa put down the phone and said Mommy I want to go to daddy's house.  Then she picked up the phone and said daddy I need you to come get me.  I wanted to say "Oh hell yeah be right there!" Instead I simply told her we would need to talk that over with Mommy.  She asked to talk to uncle Martha and I obliged.  She and he talked for a couple of minutes and then she told him she went to Jamba Juice.  He gave me the phone back and I asked if I could have some because her kind was my favorite (I don't even know what kind it was) she said daddy you will have to go get your own and then giggled again.  Other then that we exchanged kisses and hugs and concluded todays conversation.  The rest of my day consisted of nothing more then yard work, laundry, house work, and emptying the pool so I can clean it.  I did go work on a friends computer and while I was doing that he told me that he and his wife are getting a divorce.  I think that sucks there is way to much of the divorce virus running around.  It needs to go away like a bad habit.  The only other thing I guess is I would loved to have had a chance to go to the concert tonight with the guys from work but I am so poor I cannot even afford the 15 dollar tickets.    Oh well there will be other c
