addled nerves a second wind.  I’ve had 3rd, 4th and 5th winds since seeing as it’s now 10:45pm Pacific time and I haven’t slept in two and a half days!  I managed to get through customs in good time although nearly got into trouble with a man with a very big gun for taking a photo inside the customs area.  Apparently this was a threat to national security.  Funny how compliant one will become when faced with a sidearm bearing homeland security full metal jacket type.    Robyn and Steve’s friend, the lovely Gratia (pronounced Gray-shia), met me at the metallic and futuristic looking SFO airport.  We trundled my gear around and onto the BART (Bar Area Rapid Transport).  BART whisked us underground north through and under the greater Bay area.  We traveled through the city, Berkley, Oakland and eventually arrived in Layfette where Robyn and Steve live.    Lafayette is a sleepy SUV laden city fully furnished with parks and trees.  It feels like a small town built in a sparse forest with all the trees and hills sprouting out from the manicured lawns.  Gratia was the ultimate host.  She fed and watered me and we went for a fascinating drive around the local area.  We stopped at a cute super market and discussed the properties of Root beer with the locals.  American super markets are something to behold.  Talk about choice.  We bought a tub of vanilla ice cream to have with our root beer floaters – the American equivalent of a spider made with root beer.  Then we sat in the shade at Robyn and Steve’s leafy abode and watched squirrels, robins and the cat all frolic together.  The cat got a bird and I felt compelled to intervene and rescue it.  That was a drama in itself.  I’ve only been here one day and already I deserve a complementary Sierra Club membership.  Robyn came home from work, Steve was in San-Diego for the weekend so haven’t met him yet.  We had Italian for dinner before I finally collapsed into bed.  I have a 6 hr flight to NY tomorrow which should be fun.    ---    Observations:    Every second house having a US flag on the porch.  It’s kinda cool that people are proud of where they live and think  bout what it means to belong to a bigger community.    Americans like really big cars.  The kind they open new iron ore factories to build and generally have massive 4.5 – 5 litre engines.  They are everywhere.    Soccer moms.  Gratia explained that these are the types who have big glasses, permanently attached cell phones and ferry little Timmy to and from soccer practice in their goliath sized cars.  Maybe they are expecting to traverse a river or gorge along the way?  Ahh – the illusion of safety.    The people are really friendly.  The laid back approach of the Californian’s is apparent.  The wonderful hospitality of Robyn and Gratia was much appreciated.  Thanks heaps guys!    Finally - seeing a squirrel!  They have puffy tails.  Tee Hee.    ---    [end]
