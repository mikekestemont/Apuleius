to think about. It evokes emotions so as to cause people to become sick. By referring to those words ,&nbsp; it clearly stated to us the horror of war.&nbsp;
This is my first enrty for EDU 3234 course. On the 8th of July 2004, we have had a long discussion on positon and research paper with Dr. Edwin, but the focuses are more on how to choose title and construct the thesis statement for both paper. As usual Dr. Edwin carried out brainstorming activity in order to tackle our understanding. According to my understanding, thesis statement should be strong, assertive summary of our own interpretation. Thesis statement of a literary paper cannot be too broad or too vague.   Some examples given by my lecturer's are :-  1. Women upliftment in society is through education.  2. Unfulfilment in marriages lead to infidelity.  3. Emily is a victim of a patrichal society.   I am still looking forward for my thesis statement for my position paper as being assigned by Dr. Edwin as a homework for this week. I think I would like to work on poems.   (112299)
As I go on writing my position paper, I find out that there are many quotations to deal with...I think it is tempting to insert many long quotations in my paper and use my own words only for connecting passages.I do this because I feel the author of my sources are better writers than I am.But, I do not quote excessively... long series of quotation gives the impression that I cannot think for myself.I use direct quotations only when the sources is particularly clear or expressive.One thing for sure... most all of the time I used my own words to summarize and paraphrase my sources and to explain my ideas....Actually I  am still not satisfied with my position paper...
I got some problem in linking one to another paragraph without discernible bumps,gaps or shifts.If I let the problem occur continously my sentences and paragraphs will not flow smoothly.So.. how am I to improve this skill?         After talking and discussing to some of my friends and doing some reading,I get to know some of the techniques...First rule, a topic sentence should tell readers whether the information they are about to read supports the thesis statement directly or supports a key idea in the essay which in turn support the thesis.Second rule,reprtition of key words is an important techniques for gaining coherence because if too much information seems new, a paragraph will be hard to read.To prevent repetitions from becoming dull we can use variations of a key word.         From those two rules, I'll try to connect my ideas briallantly especially in order to bind together text that looks too choppy.Another point that I must remember is by using certains words and phrases signal connections between ideas. For instance, to show addition; further,furthermore and moreover can be used AND if to indicate logical relationship, we can use therefore,consequently,thus or as a result. I will remember all those things to help me in writing my position as well as my research p
