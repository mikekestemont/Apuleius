the challenge, cracking in not one but two goals and believe me they were not happy. We kept it up and defended magnificently letting in one goal about half way through. We got away with a few lucky scrapes, they were hitting posts left right and centre, but we still held that 2-1 lead. We had held them right up to the final seconds when a slight lapse in concentration on my part (sorry lads) let a little whipper snapper round the back from a corner to score a goal with, would you believe it, the very last kick of the ball! Lads we were seconds away from our first victory. But hey we scraped a draw and our first points on the board.
Come on lads - Now we can start playing. I've bagged us some footy shirts so we don't need to look like the team who just strolled in off the streets. The only thing is.... we need to start playing like a real team. Looks like we've got 6 players tonight and it's a late one because our last game is at 9.45. I'll bring the new kit along, all you need to do in return is play like you've never played before. I think we've got some pretty decent players now - we just need to gel.   Chase every ball and earn every touch. Damage limitation is not a mentality, winning is.  see you later chaps
True to form the last week was just as bad as all that went before it, a couple of losses, we played OK but there are no prizes for coming last or are there&hellip;      urlLink      urlLink      urlLink      urlLink        urlLink      urlLink      urlLink     &nbsp;       &hellip;well boys all the embarrasment was worth it after all. Because of the sheer bloody mindedness and some would say stupidity of turning up every week for a sound thrashing by all comers, we were awarded the award for most Sportmanly team.   I can honestly say it's been emotional. Those emotions are usually anger, dissapointment, embaressment or pain, but still emotional. I hope that everyone is out on the lash next Wednesday, details to follow, but I think Clem has a few ideas if you know what I mean!   Until next time
Sorry guys I completely forgot to do this week and my memory is so laim I can't even remember what happened. If anyone has any recolection of what horrible fate became us please post then in comments. Cheers.  I believe that Tony Susi, Hutch, Stuart Wakeman, Roberto Spicer and myself played but that could also be wrong ;)
We got very wet and got beat again.  5-2 DECHERT (a dribble) (Hutch,Lee) 4-1 REAL MADRASS (a downpour) (Hutch) 4-0 LUCKY MONKEYS (torrential) ()  Man of the match may as well be Hutch this week, seeing as he whinged the least and scored 2 goals. Full effort to all who turned up, it was a pretty horrible evening. The last game was just insane, playing footy in torrential rain, with lightning as a back drop, brilliant :)  Better luck next week b
