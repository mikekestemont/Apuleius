As for your show, you know it's been extremely successful, and "every aspect of [it] has been praised in the media."  Enough with the whining already.  (I must also add, since I know he'll do it if I don't, that  urlLink Dockgoose 's mother was Conan's high school Spanish teacher.)

It has long been said that Marshfield, Wisconsin is the New York City of the Midwest.  Both cities have people, and stores, and some grass here and there.  But while these cities are indeed strikingly similar, if you think long and hard some differences can be found.  For example, here is what locals are most concerned with in their respective cities.  *NYC.
