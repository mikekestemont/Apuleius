think that the 80s represented the very peak of the huge ego trip that had been building for some time, as with most things this was strongest in America and spread from there. In the 80s people were just enjoying everything that they had created for themselves up to that point, and it drove them a bit mad. The 20s were similar to a slightly lesser extent, they represented another peak. After these decades things begin to decline a bit, as though people realised how crazy things had gotten and started to feel a bit self conscious, therefore they throttled down a bit, resulting in the uncertain awkwardness of the 90s. Where things were just a bit too quiet and plain. I like these peak decades a lot, as I already mentioned, especially the pastel suits and music of the 80s, there was something about this pop and new rave that was so lame it became kind of cool to me. However recently I’ve started to think that more interesting were the build up to these times, it is with these decades, specifically the 60s and 70s that we can really see how our society moved and evolved, there’s a lot we can learn from our actions at these times, lessons which have to some extent been lost or dulled over time as we revert to our old ways again, however I guess that’s inevitable, if we follow the pattern we have for the last 80 years or so, I refer to the decline and fall I describe above, with society reaching its peak and reverting again, from history we can see that the most important things that changed during these times were our actual attitudes towards a lot of things but most importantly towards life itself. It is these attitudes which interest me some much in the 60s and 70s, it seems that the predominant feeling during these middle decades, when we try to find ourselves and do most of our questioning of our values etc is one of total indifference, a wonderful disregard for the system that has brought us this far, a yearning for change, a wish just to enjoy life, an openness towards everything. It is this mindset that I am in love with. It is this mindset that brought about the birth of the greatest music ever, rock, and specifically my hero Jimi Hendrix. It is through the drug haze that more greatness than has ever been seen before came. I refer to the hippie set and the summer of love, but more widely I refer to most people at that time, who in some way experienced society changing. In fact it has been suggested that the freethinking individuals of the 60s/70s directly led to the yuppieism of the 80s, this may explain why they both hold a special place in my heart. Anyway, I put it to you that 1965 - 1975 were the greatest years that man has ever known; there’s nothing more to say. Damn, I really was born at the wrong t
