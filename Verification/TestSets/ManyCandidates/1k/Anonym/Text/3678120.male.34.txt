a clear and present danger to this country because it goes directly against what this country stands for.  They’ve gotten in through the back door as far as I’m concerned.  The tyrannical regime that defines these rules of political correctness has not done so through legislation, but through pushy and snide comments and this attitude of being superior.  There is just this large manifestation of their beliefs out there, and we being a kind and decent society have started to buy into it.  We want to be good to people.  We don’t want to offend anyone.  But this is getting out of control.  It’s turning us into sheep.  For when we start to compromise our pride, and start to feel ashamed of our flag for fear it may offend a visitor, we’ve started to lose something that is a magnificent gift.  That magnificent gift is Freedom.  Beware my friends; don’t be tricked by their “good” intentions.  Think for yourselves.  That is freedom.      Now, to my fellow Americans:  Perhaps I’ve gone overboard with linking the terrorist attacks with Political Correctness.  But I’ve done it to make a point.  The point is, united we stand.  Every time an American Flag is taken down, that is a small victory for the bad guys.  Every time we compromise our pride, the bad guys win a small battle.  Every time we give up our Freedom, the terrorists get what they want.  As a former United States Marine, I truly believe the best defense is an over powering offense.  I believe the best way to secure Peace is to prepare for War.  That’s right, Peace, through superior firepower.  We don’t want to be the bully on the block, but we do want to be able to whip the bully’s ass.  And united, as one country, as one nation, we will.    Now, I ask that each and every one of you pray for our country.  Pray for our leaders, military and political.  Pray to give them the courage they will need to see this through.  We cannot stop with a missile attack here, and a missile attack there.  This enemy is not a new enemy, but a dedicated one.  We've fought terrorism for years, but with the objective of punishing it.  We must now fight terrorism with the objective of eliminating it.  We must make it a goal for each and every country on this planet to combat terrorism at the heart.  I think as the World leader, it is our responsibility to lead the way.  To accomplish this goal, we must be patient.  We must be dedicated to the end result.  We must elect officials who will continue to fight this fight.  We may get weary.  We may get tired.  We may get fed up with our sons and daughters dieing in this war.  However, as tired as we get, we must stay the course.  We must see it through to the only acceptable end.  And the way I see it, the only acceptable end, is Victory.    God Bless America  Cary M.
