Yesterday was speech day. After more than a  month of ardous training, the day finally came. Rahul even thought at first that our speech day GOH drill itself was a rehearsal. That is how hard it is to tell the difference.  I'm quite sad. The two people in my line are Jordan and Weiting, who for some reason keeps on getting screamed at by Herman.  Here's what happened on Saturday:   Morning -  had bible quiz training b4 the drill.  L8 morning -  drill practice, drill practice, drill practice.  Lunch -  Leonard predicted that it could have been komala (is that how you spell it?) but instead it was  pieces of meat and vegetable in between two pieces of bread in a styrofoam box  in which the general idea of the compliments can be summarised into the word "rotten".  Afternoon -  THE TIME HAS COME. we thus showed our superior drill to the inferior mortals of the other uniform groups.

Always "stand straight, chins up, chest out", have a sharp jerk of head when taking dressing, sharp turning during whatever  pu-sing , etc. 10.Remember to keep in line (Quote:"It is very easy to see how you are not in line from far away!" - Herman)  Extra Special Tip: 11.
