and some classic games... You'll have some of the best fun in your young lives and see what crap game designers are passing off on you today. And for the older gamers, if you've still got your systems, break them out. Memories of days past are lurking, and they want out. You won't regret it. Me? I'm already hitting up E-Bay for old games I've lost or sold.
If you know me in real life, you already know this about me. But for those who don't, I'm a HUGE fan of professional swimming. I used to swim in high school, and still do it for fun and to stay in shape. Now, I was above average in high school, but nowhere near good enough to do anything with it. But it's fun, a great workout, and exciting to watch.  NBC is broadcasting the US Olympic Trials from Long Beach, taped earlier today. My first comment is that I'm pissed that I forgot it was going on - I would have driven up there to see this live.  Michael Phelps is an 18 year-old phenom of the sport, who has set a few world records and is so good that Mark Spitz (a world famous Australian Olympic swimmer, and multiple world record holder) has been quoted as saying that this kid could break his record of 7 Gold Medals. He didn't even show his "A" game in the 200m freestyle, and whooped up on the competition.  Natalie Coughlin, who was widely regarded as an "up-and-comer" in 2000 (but then suffered a devastating shoulder injury), started her comeback a few years ago, and she is ON. She's the ONLY American woman to ever complete the 100m backstroke in under 1:00. (If you don't know swimming, that is GREAT.) Well, she didn't get a great start off the block, but she did it AGAIN. 0:59.85. Oh. My. God. AND she's a massive hottie. Where do I go to meet her?
We're headed for destruction; don't you want to go?  Sorry, I was trying to think of a clever title for this first post, and an old Jackyl song just popped into my head... I had to finish the intro. ;)  Anyway, I've been trying out a bunch of free blogging sites lately, in an attempt to find a good, quality (and free) blogging company. I'm a little broke right now, so I can't afford to pay for the monthly hosting fees.  Let's see how this goes, and I hope I'll see you back for more.
Oh yeah, this class looks like it'll be fun.  This is a Political Science course on Voting, Campaigning and Elections. First, this can be fun because of the timing - I'm taking this just before the 2004 Presidential and Congressional elections. Second, the teacher is pretty cool and funny. Professor Galderisi is a Jewish Democrat from New York; he loves to make fun of the Democrats, and relates a lot of the course lessons to what has happened in previous elections.  Oh yeah, there are a few hotties in class, too. :
