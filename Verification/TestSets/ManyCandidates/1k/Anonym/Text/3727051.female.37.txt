and filled out my very first missing person's report.  Sure enough, 3 hours or so later, guess who pulls into the driveway?  After saying a brief prayer of thanks to God for bringing him home safely, the first words out of my mouth were, "Get your shit and get out."  For no other reason than pure laziness, I won't recount all the angry words (my side only), tears (my side), firmness (my side), and more tears (still my side).  The upshot of all this was, my husband finally admitted he needed and would seek help.  He made the first calls, took the first steps.  I let him sleep in the RV (I admit I felt sorry for him), then on Wednesday morning, we talked.  And talked, and talked, and talked.  Really talked.  For the first time possibly in our marriage.  I love my husband, but I will not be a victim.  I also will not give up when there is hope, and I saw hope here.  Marriage vows are sacred, and I promised to love him in good times and bad, in sickness and in health.  I will not desert him while he is in that dark place in his soul - not when I know he wants to climb out of it.  Alcoholism is a disease.  We can't cure it, but together perhaps we can conquer it.
Now begins the descent into madness.  What a fool I've been to assume the drinking would stop.   What kind of man says he's off to the grocery store on a Sunday morning and doesn't return until early Monday morning?  I guess it doesn't really matter.  In the intervening hours, I have come to a decision.  My marriage is over.  It's just not over yet.  I must steel myself to do what women since the beginning of time have done.  Be patient, wait.

I shall endeavor to be a good wife and mother, and all the while, I will be working hard to pay off the bills while beginning a savings account of my own.  One hundred and fifty dollars a month to start, direct deposited.   I found that there was very little emotion this time.  I have become apathetic to the whole thing.  I want my life back, I want myself back.  I don't want to be shut in with the paranoia, the distrust, the rub of feeling that is too painful to bear.  I want to be free of it.  But, I want to be free of it on my own terms.   I am a strong individual.  Perhaps I was never meant to be married in the first place.  Perhaps I was naive enough to believe that he wouldn't stray into the depths of his disease after so long out of them.  Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.  I want my strength back.  So now, I settle down to wait.  I can do that.  I've had lots of p
