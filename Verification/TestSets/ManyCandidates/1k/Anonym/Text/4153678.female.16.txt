to buck up on chinese too. *sighs again* There's always too much things to do with too little time. I lack the self discipline too, tho i know i have to determination. It's very strong in me, to keep myself going and not giving up. But somehow my fatal point is my lack of self discipline to start work. I'm always easily distracted. * sigh* But.. i'm going to put all these behind me.. i'm going to start ANEW!!! Until then will i finally attain my 'Hakuna Matata.'
Yoz yOz..today's my first day using this blogger thingy.. hahaz still not used to it.. hmn..well  we celebrated National DAy in school today.. *HoOrAy*.. There's a long holiday weekend..No School till Wednesday... *ya hoo*  =P    Well the highlight of today's celebration was AJ race. It was fun but i fell along the way, on the concrete pavement outside MacDonalds near BIshan ITE. Suffered a few scratches on my palms,elbows and knees.. *Ouch*  *suay* -_-!!   Minor ones though..applied antiseptic already.. :) HeY!!! Our class was the first JC 1 class to complete the race!! Guess it was because we didnt had many stations and we were practically running thru out the race. When we returned to school we played 总集密码 while having milo and oreos. Hahaz.. this was the most fun game today. Miss Chan,Hui Zi, Michelle, ShiQi, JunJian, Boon Han, Zhi Qi, Diana did forfeits. They were really sporting. Esp Junjian, Shiqi and Boon Han Zhi Qi. Our class kinda scandaled them to do the forfeit in pairs. Each pair had to finish a bottle of water in 20 secs. Really fun. TOok many photos too. =P After the celebration we went for class lunch with Miss Chan. Not everyone went tho. Had lunch at Sukara Thai restaurant. Nice lunch. Found out quite some stuff about Miss Chan's past too. It seems that she's quite into sports too. HoneStly I admire her adventurous spirit in trying out so many various CCAs and activities.             As for how i am going to spend this rare long weekend holiday, i think i'll probably just stay home and catch up with work. There's lots to do and i'm really behind time in studies. I'm a little afraid for the upcoming CT and promo.. Grades have not been optimistic..Come to think of it there's not much time left either. Guess this makes it more crucial to catch hold of the remaining time.             CLDDS alumni is putting up a performance (drama) on 13th and 14th AUgust.. Tickets have not been selling well honestly, reckoned it's due to the clash of CT and probably because it's because it's put up by alumni and not students ourselves, so it's more difficult to persuade fellow friends to come support this event.                        Hahaz..hmn.. 'Singapore Idols' is going to be broadcast on NAtional Day.. wonder how our local talents are. Mom says it'll definitely disappoint me. I don not know. However i still believe that there'll be surprises. We shall wait and see.           GUess i'll stop here for today. HOpe my blog turns out n
