sleeping off a slight hang-over), we headed back to WEM and spent the afternoon at the World Waterpark for some serious watersliding and wave-riding. I think we even managed to shop a bit too! I couldn't have asked for a better birthday excursion, it was one of our best trips and it was all packed into a day and a half.
Ah... Life seems so tame after 2 weeks of house buying insanity!  Nothing much is happening in the aftermath, but apparently my wife has some sort of secret surprise planned for my B-day this weekend.  All that has been divulged is that it's in Edmonton and my buddy Andrew is going to be there.  My first assumption is that there's a band playing somewhere there, but I haven't come across any big shows for the weekend.  I don't want to ruin the surprise, so I've been decidedly not seeking out what it may be.  Should be a blast whatever it is.
A sad day for us Albertans.  Calgary just lost the Stanley Cup.  It seemed pretty clear from the first two periods that Calgary was just outmatched in Game 7.  Tampa Bay was unrelenting and by the end of the 2nd period, it was 2-0 for the Lightning.  But Calgary came back in the third for a fierce battle that was missing from the first 2 periods.  Scoring during an undeserved power-play (Thanks Refs!) and laying it on shot after shot.  But TB proved unstoppable denying all but the one goal, winning the Cup with a final score of 2-1.  A well deserved win for Tampa, but it would have been amazing to have the Cup back in Canada with the Flames.  They did there best and proved there worth all the way to the end.  Good work Flames, maybe next year we'll see the cup a little closer to home.
Today I got the call.  The financing is finalized and all conditions for purchasing have been fulfilled!  We got the blueprints for our house to be and we're stoked to see it built.  They already have the foundation dug and poured.  We are the proud owners of a hole!  The framing is going to be severely delayed due to the high demand and lack of labourers here, but by November 1st we will have a brand spanking new house!  Can't get much cooler than that.
I know all you readers(yes, all 2 of you) are probably bored sick of hearing about the new house.  Well suck it up, cause thats what keeps me posting!   Picked out the colors for the outside of the house today and should have a rendering to approve by next week.  I'm also pleased to report that they've  finally  started framing!  And since we're out of the condo in 14 days, we've got our mailbox all set up.  The new areas of town have whats called a "Community Mail Box" which has a box and key assigned to you.  This allows us to start receiving our mail at our new address 3 months before we move in!  How c
