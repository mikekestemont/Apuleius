him, all the memories come flowing back, all the promises, everything. And it was seriously a huge shock for me to look at him with his "girlfriend" and his kid. It was merely painful actually.     &nbsp;   but yeah... i'm not a whimp i can deal with it     &nbsp;   life goes on......     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;
Okay, I don't even know where to begin, camp venango this year was remarkable. It possessed its ups and downs, but the complete turn out of the camp taken as a whole really really shocked me. I left there with a new perception on existence, and on myself.  I am just going to give details on the last night at camp, that would be a Saturday night. Oh, wow, a frigid night. The air was crisp, the stars were brilliant, and there a hundred plus youth stood underneath a pavilion. A lot of lives were altered that night, I am assuming a lot of first time dedications were taken place, but for me and a few other people it was just a superb occasion to honor our God, and hopefully get back on track with our spiritual walks in Christ.  The thrill, for me at least, started with the splendid praise music, that kind of just hyped me up, and got me excited about the Lord. They, then encouraged us to break up into small groups, and just pray, implore to the designer of the universe. Okay, first off, if you need to know anything you need to know that I love breaking off into groups and praying. There's something about hearing people cry out from the floor of their hearts that gets me all anxious. So when they propose that we fracture off into small groups, I have to confess I was pretty darn excited.  So in the circle it was me, laken, Josh Mumau, Kaitie (chick from meadville), nathan (my little brother), Ryan Riegner, Tyler, and Raul. I think that's it, but if I am forgetting anyone, sorry. So anyways we got in our circle, and Tyler said that he needed prayer, of course we were all wondering about what, and when he started explaining how he has been absolutely numb to "God" this year, I couldn't help but feel really guilty. Because after all I have been to. I have felt like the biggest fake this year. Okay taking into consideration, I have had my points where I was entirely on fire for God, there was a lot more "spiritual ruts" this year. Anyways following that a few other people spoke up and were like, yeah seriously, I need something in my life.....  OKAY, so the praying began, wow, it was so amazing. Its not anything I can put in plain words. I have had people ask me "What does the presence of God feel like?" Well to be straightforward that is an unanswerable question. It has no answer. It has no words to describe it. Your heart races. You transcend, and its incredible. Seriously unbelievable.  So I leave you with this:    GOD is a
