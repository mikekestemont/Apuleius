they can be). Trust me. There will be a time when you want to really say  something  about someone! If you are a sucker for compliments about you abnormaly cool site (like me and mine;-) get readers!  2: Do  NOT  give up your url in your resyme! You're job takes up 70-80% of your time. If you can't blog about that, then what's left? Not much I tell you. I've had that problem for quite some time now. Untill I found out (today) that I didn't put my  current  url on the resyme *evil grin and satanic laughter*. Now that whas a relief!  3: These are the golden and unwritten (untill now) rules. These should not be broken. If you already have broken one or two of them. Then follow this third rule. MOVE!! Change url as fast as you can dammit! Save your freedom of speach as fast as you can.  And that ends our brodcast of the day. Good night, and don't lett the bedbugs bite.
Yes, new layout. This one is a template, sligtly modified. I'm just to tired these days to fix my own shit, and besides, this layout is so zen :) But for some reason unkown to me it doesn't seem to work just right. I don't know what's wrong and I can't seem to get it fixed. Maybe it's just my Explorer (that wouldn't be the first time) or maybe it's a html error. Give me a beep if you fint out  what  it is.  Bye bye y'all...
Something's wrong with the  urlLink sitemeter  counter. It keeps giving me  "unknown"  on most of my refferals. I'd understand it if I'd been editing my webpage on my computer a lot, but I haven't. I haven't done anything on my template for a long time. So why does this happen? It's damn annoying, that's what it is...
ATTENTION ALL READERS:  This site will be taking a short break (well, actualy the break's allready begun, as you might have noticed....or not) while I give my new  urlLink GreyMatter  powered layout it's last finish. That may take some time as I'm a total newbie to the layoutsystem in GM. But, anyways...that's what's going on right now. Keep in touch!
Shit! I've got all the stuff working for  urlLink MT  over at my new  urlLink portland account  and then I find out that I'm missing the DB_File module! And portland isn't exatly known for their fast responses when it comes to support. Crap!  Still looking, any ideas?!
Fuck!  urlLink United.net.kg  has gone bye-bye without notice. That's one free host less. Crap! Where will I find another good one?  This is taking way to much time, I want  urlLink MT  workin' now!
NOTE:  This is just the old bloggerpowered site. It's not updated anymore, nor is it looked at that much. But feel free to have a browse, and leave a comment or two. But if you do, you have to let me know on the mainpage ;)  Peace out!
I have no idea on why the archives are gone, nor can I get them back. S
