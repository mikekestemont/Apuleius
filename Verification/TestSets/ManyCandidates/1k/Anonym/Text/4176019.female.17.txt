I’ve written them here. And perhaps they are. But here I will adopt an existentialist viewpoint: Things are bleak, they always will be so all you can do is keep on going and try lessen the bleakness…  Anyhow back to the question at hand…. Both viewpoints seem so mutually exclusive and yet I find that I believe both… and I don’t mean to say that in such a way that suggests I believe one in some situations and the other in others… I believe them both… simultaneously. I believe both that everyone, every person, every being share the same essential core, not of humanity… but of… life, I suppose. Though that isn’t even quite the right word for it. I believe that because of this core common to all that we are all intrinsically connected… kind of a collective unconscious of all life… But at the same time I believe that we are all isolated from everyone, and everything else by our access to the world. Everything we see, we know, we are told, is filtered through our senses, our experiences. I truly believe that no one can truly understand another person’s feelings or experience even if they have gone through the same… I suppose an easy example would be someone who likes mushrooms as opposed to someone who doesn’t. They both have eaten the same thing… but both have come to completely different conclusions… and perhaps even taste completely different things.  Wll anyway yet another reason why I tend yo consider myself one big bag of contradictions…. Heck just look at the characters that pop into my head… all of them have come from me and really are just different aspects of me. I sometimes feel I have more personalities than someone diagnosed with the disorder… Its just that all mine are blended together in one mix that is then what the world sees…. Or doesn’’t see thather…. There are some personalities that are much stronger than others… at least on the surface. Scathach for example represents a darker more aggressive side of me… but though it seems a strong piece it is really quite buried under the rest of my traits… which is probably one of the reasons I enjoy writing her character so much… it allows me to unbury that side of me and just get some of it out.  Well, anyhow, enough from me… its almost 3:00 and I’ve gotten enough out of my mind that I should be able to sleep now… sometimes I think that writing these Random Musings, as I’ve taken to calling them, is really just a non-magic version of a pensieve (A reference to Harry Potter for those who started giving me weird looks at that moment) they allow me to just lay thoughts that are swirling around my head too quickly to quiet them… and then they lose their urgency and sort of return quietly to the back-shelf until next time… anyway I have to work tomorrow so I tear myself away from these writings with some reluctance. Until next t
