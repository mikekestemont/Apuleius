safe. We lived in a non-western area, strictly Chinese and very old, the homes were about 400 years old. We grew to know the people in the neighborhood, and played with their children, saluted their grandmothers and conversed with the students.  I will write more when I get my head clear, I have had five hours of sleep in two days. I am feverishly working to get all my yards done and I will leave for Colorado on the 6th to help my daughter get ready for the home birth. I sure look forward to catching this baby. I never thought I would help in the birth of my own grandchild.  I thought about all of you and your kids when I was away. I was immersed in a community that generally takes care of it's members and I thought of how much we Americans could learn from other cultures. I also thought about all of the generations it will take to put Iraq back together, the families who have been rent asunder there, and all of the bad things people, Iraqi and American are doing to each other. There are other ways of being, I have faith we will evntually find them. Love and peace ladies. Adele
I don't know if any of you are still reading the web log, but if you are, I want to direct your attention to the Links section at the bottom right of this page. I've added some links that might be useful to you (Mothers Opposing Bush) and your soldier (GI Rights Hotline, Iraq Veterans Against War), in addition to the generally supportive MFSO site and Bring Them Home Now. Check them out. Every time someone visits a web site, it moves a little higher in the web hierarchy and becomes more visible to people doing searches!   If you know of any others that might be of interest to our members, let me know.
Hey ladies! Stacy and I are mentioned in this weeks online version of Business Week on the front page article about military families. The baby was born by emergency c-section on Thursday the 5th at 1:11 am, the midwives were great and the labor was strong, but the baby's ear was facing where the top of his head should be, and he could not move once the water broke, so the 24 hours of hard labor did not budge him into positon and she had to have the c-section. Mother and baby are fine. His name is Tyree Nathan , he was 8lb 3oz, and he has more hair than most adults. Long, black, hair, a full head. As soon as I get a digital photo I will post it. So much is happening this summer. Off to Japan in 11 days!!! Let us hope the army does not declare her fit to serve after the operation in two months, I am hoping the publicity alone makes her too much of a hot potato for the army to redeploy. My best wishes are with all of you, love, and peace, A
