hello everyone  &nbsp;  well. what a week hey.  &nbsp;  i've got nothing special to talk about this week.  &nbsp;  my boyfriend and i aren't doing well at all, at the moment. but everyone is telling me to just hang on and see how it works out.  i guess i can do that.  as long as he doesn't hurt me again.  &nbsp;  umm  &nbsp;  i'm going ice skating tomorrow. a good start to a new week, i think.  yeah.  &nbsp;  i like ice skating. very relaxing. i'm taking a morning session, so it should be pretty quiet too. (good for speed skating:P)  &nbsp;  i told dad i didn't want to play superleague on sundays anymore.  he hasn't had a sad at me that big for a long time!  he's the coach you see, and for the last 8 weeks of netball i've only played half a game or less, which REALLY sucks, as i feel i haven't made any sort of contribution to the game or anything, so i decided to quit.  &nbsp;  meh.  &nbsp;  i'll miss it, but i'd rather not play, than only play half games every week.  &nbsp;  one less day wasted in the week.  &nbsp;  one more day to organise fun stuffs.  &nbsp;  or to sit here.&nbsp; &nbsp;   hmm&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; i wish i could get some sleep...&nbsp;
see above? &nbsp; i wish.. &nbsp; four days with no sleep whatsoever REALLY does suck &nbsp; i am sooo tired it's not funny. &nbsp; can someone tell me why i can't sleep!!!??  please! &nbsp; i hate thinking. my brain hurts my body hurts i think i'm going insane. &nbsp; *Sigh*
