am, wondering what to do. we've talked about it, and he cant get past the built-up and day-to-day sadness enough to talk to me, laugh with me, share with me... well, love me. i need more, and he cant give it. the worst thing is that if i break it off, he'll only hurt more. but if i stay in it, i'm just waisting time, energy and emotion.  sigh  its been such a draining day. this is just the tip of the iceberg. i'm going to go get drunk with one of my best friends, S, who i love with all my heart and sometimes think that one day i'll end up with him. S and N are really good friends. how fucked up is that for ya?
so this morning i woke up especially pissed off and cranky. my left eye is all oozy and gross because of allergies and dust and god knows what else. so thats been annoying me. i decided to completely scrub out and just basically get out of bed, put jeans on and leave the house as is. sometimes that feels liberating.  i made my way up to the avenue and realized that i slept like shit and was so tired that sitting on the nasty pavement while i waited for the bus sounded just fine. so i leaned up against the deli, put my bag in front of me and took a load off. a few minutes later some old polish guy comes walking up the street. when he passes me he drops a folded dollar bill into my bag and keeps on walking, despite my protest of "what? i dont need a dollar!"  honestly though, i didnt have any cash on me. so that was kindof cool. i went into the deli and grabbed a coffee for 50 cents and that fucking rocked.  this is the coolest thing that has happened all day. i suspect it will probably come in a close second to the turkey club i'm going to have for lunch, though. the magazine i'm working at this week buys everyone lunch when theyre neck deep in a special issue. this place is my own personal hell. when they hired me for this particular stint, they expressly told me that i was to not talk to anyone on the staff. if my memory serves me correctly, i never have besides pleasantries such as 'good morning' or 'hello.' such pleasantries, i was told, were also off limits. this is one of the wierder things ever to happen in my working life.  today around the office is particularly amusing, mainly because i must have missed the outfit memo for today. the theme today that ive noticed is some kind of mix between easter-sunday-in-indiana and buffy-from-the-country-club. its all pastel and skirts and even sweaters over the shoulders. its fucking wierd. the wierd thing is that i swear EVERYONE changes styles at the same time. the chicks here rock the worst style ever. tomorrow undoubtedly will be something else that is god awful, perhaps pauly-shore-in-encino-man-meets t
