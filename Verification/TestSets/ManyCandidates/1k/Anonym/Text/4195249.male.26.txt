that their 400-year-old open enemies of freedom, justice and equality are, all of a sudden, their "friends." Furthermore, we believe that such deception is intended to prevent black people from realizing that the time in history has arrived for the separation from the whites of this nation. If the white people are truthful about their professed friendship toward the so-called Negro, they can prove it by dividing up America with their slaves. We do not believe that America will ever be able to furnish enough jobs for her own millions of unemployed, in addition to jobs for the 20,000,000 black people as well. WE BELIEVE that we who declare ourselves to be righteous Muslims, should not participate in wars which take the lives of humans. We do not believe this nation should force us to take part in such wars, for we have nothing to gain from it unless America agrees to give us the necessary territory wherein we may have something to fight for. WE BELIEVE our women should be respected and protected as the women of other nationalities are respected and protected. WE BELIEVE that Allah (God) appeared in the Person of Master W. Fard Muhammad, July, 1930; the long-awaited "Messiah" of the Christians and the "Mahdi" of the Muslims. We believe further and lastly that Allah is God and besides HIM there is no god and He will bring about a universal government of peace wherein we all can live in peace together. 3.) Isn't Allah simply Arabic for God?Allah does mean God in Arabic. For example, in an Arabic translated bible you will find that God is interpreted as Allah. However it is important to realize that the CONCEPT of Allah in Nation of Islam doctrine is radically different from the Christian concept/understanding of God. The Allah that is spoken of in the Koran (according to NOI adherents) is actually the person of "Master Fard"! There is no way someone can intelligently say that "Allah"and God can be used interchangeably. Anyone who tries to allege this is simply ignoring the facts. 4.) If the NOI is so obviously different from Historic Christianity then why does Minister Farrakhan quote passages of scripture from the bible?This is a tactic that continues to shroud the NOI's beliefs in secrecy. Historically, during the NOI's beginnings, both Elijah (Poole) Muhammad and Farrakhan relied somewhat heavily upon the bible because they were more familiar with it than the Qur'an's teachings. The bible is still used extensively during Farrakhan's speeches (whenever it does not conflict with their own errant doctrine), and his followers carefully discuss the bible and try to use non-threatening terms when discussing beliefs. It is important for them to align themselves with Christians in order to win and deceive as many of our people as they possibly can. This tactic proved to be very successful during recruitment for the Million Man March that occured in October of 1995. Please note that wherever the bible contradicts NOI doctrine, the bible will then be accused of being tampered with in that particular s
