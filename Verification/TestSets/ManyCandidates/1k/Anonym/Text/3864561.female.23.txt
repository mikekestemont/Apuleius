we know what we're going to call it (Christopher - after my brother).  Anyway, watch this space for an update this afternoon......
I read somewhere that if you put your audio player on random play and list the first ten songs, that it offers an insight into your personality. So, here are mine:  1. Feel - Robbie Williams 2. Stop Stop Stop - The Hollies 3. Heard It Through The Grapevine - Marvin Gaye 4. Misfit - Amy Studt 5. Tainted Love - Soft Cell 6. 9 To 5 - Dolly Parton 7. Generation Sex - Divine Comedy 8. Act Naturally - The Beatles 9. Stupid Thing - Aimee Mann 10. Walk This Way - Aerosmith (with Run DMC)  All that tells me is what I already knew; I have an eclectic taste in music. Not exactly rocket science.
I'm not having a very good day. I had three things I wanted to get done today and none of them are looking likely. They are:  1) do all my washing ready for going on holiday. I've been avoiding the overflowing laundry basket for the last month or so and am now paying for this; I have about seven loads to do and am still on the first one (the machine is inexplicably taking over 200 minutes to do a 90 minute cycle). At this rate I will be finished at......about lunchtime tomorrow. 2) set up my blog to do a little message at the end of each post with what music I'm currently listening to. With mp3s this is difficult. With ATRACs (which all my music files are, due to me having been stupid enough to download SonicStage on the basis that I could get a free song download with every Big Mac), it is apparently impossible. 3) add a thing to my blog that shows referrers. The preference of most bloggers for this kind of thing seems to be "TrueFresco", but the only one of theirs that will fit in my sidebar is the one which only tracks referrers over the last 24 hours. For a blog that gets anything between 3 and 5 hits a day, this seems somewhat pointless.  If anyone has any advice as to how I might be able to solve any of these problems then please do  email me . (Obviously I don't expect too many responses for the first of the three but any suggestions for the other two would be greatly appreciated.)
I can't believe that Mattel are resurrecting  Atmosfear  (I've just seen an advert for it). I remember my friend Pauline having the original version in the early 90s and, not to put too fine a point on it, it was shit. There was a video that came with the board game that was basically a disembodied head that occasionally yelled at you for......not playing fast enough, or something. I also seem to recall that before the game started you had to write down your worst fear and I always used to put "Pauline", just to piss her off (yes, I was funny even t
