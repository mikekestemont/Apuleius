happy! Listening to: Counting crows - colourblind :) at Rachel, Sophia, Louo  arg, I need sleep :s 4 days working in a row :( bleh!  Insomnia sucks ass on many levels.  Had a good day on Thursday and Friday!  Thursday I went to meet Sophia (who's on work exp) down Mumbles... she neglected to tell me she's workin in a flower shop!  We wandered down the pub and I had a good laugh at her apron :p she was unimpressed :p but we had a good chat and caught up on everything in the 3 or 4 months I havent spoken to her for!  After her lunch break was over I wandered to town... aparently Ayat saw me :s was probably in a world of my own as usual :p.  Went to find my mum a b/d pressie... ended up in hmv with no ideas at all!  Located a stone roses cd... she likes most of their stuff, infact she has a scary taste in music in general (I literally found her listening to my Maralyn Manson CDs in her car :|).  Friday: I met Rachel :D hehe, we got on really well, she's lovely!  We went for a bit of a wander to Toys r us b4 meeting Ian and grabbing lunch... I got a few strange looks for eatting large amounts of complimentary sugar :$ hehe and went to the cinema :p.  A few people we know were there... bit of a nasty confrontation, Ruth, Chris, Jay and Jo: Ian vs Ruth.  Ouch.  They point blank ignored each other :| Ian talked to Chris, I talked to Ruth about a very stupid thing Fran'd done :p we went to get tickets... aaaaaaand obviously, Chris told us to get tickets for the same time as they were going in.  Last film Ruth and Ian saw together was finding nemo.  Which they spent almost entirely making out.  So I coughed it a few times under my breath and wound Ian up :p hehehe!  Shrek 2 was awsome :D Ian and Ruth sat a long long way from each other still denying each other's existance!  Silly buggers :p.  Ian wanted to go home (mood soured a little by Ruth :s) and Rachel was gonna go too... I'd missed my bus by about 5 mins, so she offered to wait the 55 mins till the next one which was absolutely lovely!  We sat by the entrance to the Quadrent on the grass by the church chattin about anything and everything... time went fast :$ hehe, and (it being my mum's birthday) I had to be home to go out for a meal with my parents.  Blah.  lol.  Had a very good day though :)  My mum's been winding me up a tad recently... well a tad is an understatement :| she's been pissing me right off!  Whinging about everything, critisizing all that I do... raaar.  So I'm locking myself in my room for now :p blasting music at her :D mwahaha  Anyway, I'm off over Jonsey's in a min, probs post more l
