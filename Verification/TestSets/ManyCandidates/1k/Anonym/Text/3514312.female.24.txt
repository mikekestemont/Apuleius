prescribed me something that'll make me grow an extra appendage or a third eye or something.
having put it off for the last 2 weeks, I had to bite the bullet and go to the doctors about my lower back pain. I dont like being on the verge of tears because i feel like im being punched repeatedly in the kidneys, so it seemed like the only thing to do. having made my appointment, i foolishly thought that they would actually stick to the time, and I'd be in and out in about 15 minutes. Oh how wrong I was. the woman who went in before me walked into the office like she had the weight of the world on her shoulders and it too her about 3 minutes to take 4 steps into the office from the waiting room. that I could handle, until stupid mum and her spawn of satan showed up. The 2 angels (Evan and Laura-names which now bring me out in a cold sweat) started off nicely but after a few minutes, darling Laura got abit restless so decided to play with mummys keys. fair enough, as long as she keeps away from me. She did, but managed to hurl them at an old man sitting opposite. Did mummy tell her off? did she pants?! "Laura, dont throw mummys keys" not "Laura, dont throw metal objects at strangers and then laugh about it you evil little troll".. Laura then made a bee-line for my bloody wallet and tried to snatch it out of my hand..little fecker. Evan then decided to wind his sister up by getting her to scream as loud as she could, then they tried to do a tag team effort and open the door into the doctors office!(im sure the lady in there would have found it hilarious to be exposed in front of the entire waiting room). When mummy tried to get her keys back from Evan she said something like "they're my keys Evan" which he translated as "MICKEY MICKEY MICKEY" and proceeded to chant that into my face. Its so bloody hard to sit there and ignore stuff like that when its going on around you, and then have to smile at the mother when she looks at you..I gave her a sarky look and said "you must be so proud" I hope she found the sarcasm in my voice, considering inbetween us, laura was exposing herself to the room and making a squealing noise that only dolphins could hear.. and Evan was trying to pull the curtains down.
