too many people who simply adhere to the *concept* of looking professional without actually putting any human thought into what they look like.  Slacks and a buttondown with a tie can be so grossly misinterpreted, clowns would be embarassed.  Just because it *is* a shirt, and they *are* slacks, and it *is* a tie, doesn't mean they should be worn in attempted coordination.  Chaos is only beautiful in mathematical theory, not in fashion, thanks.  Hotshot young broker/designer/banker/publisher fools should also note that clothes come in other flavors besides Banana Repugnant.  Please learn to dress, and in doing so, learn to shop.  There are colors out there, and textures, and other materials besides stretch-everything.  Christ.    Note to Frenchmen everywhere: suits are *not* sweatpants.  Please wear them with a *belt* and perhaps, if you can find that famed-but-not-oft-seen "class" that you are somehow God-given and genetically endowed with, please tuck in your shirt, just so I don't feel strange for being the only one who does it...  much appreciated.
So this is it, I've made that step into the world of reality internet where people who have nothing better to do sit around and read about your life while they get high on their Sanford® King Size™ markers.  I'm not necessarily doing this to catch up with the world as much as I'm doing it for the world to catch up with me.  Unfortunately if you're trying to catch up with pre-today events, you're screwed.  Maybe I'll set up a time line fo'yo ign'ant asses.  Whatever.
I recently reinstalled my air conditioner, an exercise in pure functionality.  ie. mostly the dysfunctionality of my room when the A/C was sitting on the floor and robbing me of almost 4 square feet of space (that's a king's ransom in this city).  While I am sad to lose a good portion of my view onto the world, as well as my access to my porch (read: fire escape), I am happy because I can now relocate my hamper *behind* my bicycle and free up some floor space.  The bugger A/C wasn't bad to lift off the floor and install or anything, and I was greeted by all make and manner of dust, grit, grime, and filth which had been communing underneath.  Once I got past these little commonwealths, I entered upon the almost forgotten trove of CDs which had been slowly making their way further and further into history and out of my memory in the months I couldn't gain access to them.  It was, for lack of a better phrasiology, like Kwanzaa in August.  Or Christmas in April.  Or whatever.  Today, I will be raiding more of these CDs.  Either before or after my jaunt to the marshy, broken up land of Breuckelen (and hopefully to the sovereign of said land, Lord Peter Luger).    Pete of Texas is supposed to be in town tonight but I don't think I'm going to be able to see him, being that it's just the start of the workweek and he'll undoubtedly want some party-time into the night.
