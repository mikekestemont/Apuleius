wash the sand off my ass. And this one huge wave hit my ass the last time I did so, and my ass became exposed... lmfao..  Yet at the waterpark on that really fast slide where I felt like I would fly off, nothing happened to me..
I've come to the conclusion that most of Sarasota is filled with republican dumbasses missing half their brains. Ugh. I really wish I lived in Boston still. People had brains there. They were fucking assholes, but they had brains.
So, my sister called up this morning, and we started talking about my parents and I driving up to Boston to stay with her, then her coming back down with us to Florida. We started talking about how we would go to the water park, and then of course..  She starts talking about how we should go out to eat at a steakhouse. And I was like "ew." And she said "Oh, yeah. I forgot. Well, you can eat a salad."   Me - "I don't like salads." Her - "Come on" Me - "I don't eat salads..." Her - "Oh my god. Come on Shelly. You can't force your beliefs onto other people. Just because you're a vegetarian doesn't mean you have to make other people be one."   Lmfao. All I was saying was that I didn't want to go to a fucking steakhouse, and that I usually don't eat salads. And it makes sense that I wouldn't want to go to one, since I'm a fucking vegetarian. Jesus christ. And its not like my parents would go to one anyway. They stopped eating red meat.   Anyway, then she called back and talked to my mom, and in referring to me she said something along the lines of...  "You spoil your children and let them do whatever they want so they grow up to become spoiled horrible brats."   How am I spoiled? I simply don't want to eat dead animals.
hahaha ok I'm a bitch.  I told a lie.  too late.
Yeah, anyway. I think we're seeing the Manchurian Candidate today. That should be fun...  Yesterday I went shopping for school clothes. Crappo, I have nice clothes. Most of them were pretty cheap because there was no state sales tax, and many people were having sales. lmfao. I got 2 pairs of pants from one store that were originally 48 dollars each, but i ended up getting them for like 42 dollars all together. So they were like 21 dollars. I think thats pretty good considering the jeans actually fit me and didnt look ugly. Seriously. Whenever I come across cheap pants, they usually fit me just right, but they're way too long. Or they're the right length, but they're too baggy.  But you know, nothing in wetseal fit me, and their pants were like 40 dollars. Well, I got a shirt that was 5 dollars (it was originally like 15 or 25, I forgot)...  Yeah, yeah. I'll stop talking about clothes.  I think I'm gonna eat my salsa even though its been out for like... 4 days. :
