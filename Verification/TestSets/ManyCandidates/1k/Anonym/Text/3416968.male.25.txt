this leaves me totally open to heartbreak, but I don't care, i'm taking this chance. I actually pick up the phone and call him (he calls me as well), and I do it because I want to. I actually want to speak with him! You know this is HUGE for me. I actually spent the night with him on Saturday night, and there was no sex...he didn't even try. He just held me all night. Awwwwwww, LOL. I don't know...he compliments me all the time. He likes my body just the way it is...I feel secure around him. Okay, let me go, I'm just gushing now, LOL. For real, this one is a keeper I think. I'll have to let you know how this goes =).
Okay, I need to really evaluate what is really going on with me. I finally have a man that truly fits me, and it seems to not be enough for me. I'm engaging in self destructive behavior and I can't seem to help myself. What is wrong with me? CJ is a really great guy. He's honest, sincere, attractive, mature...everything I say I want in a guy. We get along great. Yet, every chance I get, I seem to be looking for more. Am I not as ready to settle down in a monogomous relationship as I like to think I am? I seem to have more questions than answers. I'm so used to being single, and being able to do whatever I want to do, I guess old habits are hard to break. I spend a great deal of my free time with CJ, whether it's me going over to his house after I get off work (or if I'm working days, I'll go over and spend the night and leave from there), or him spending the night at my apartment after he gets off work or leaves school. In any case we're spending a great deal of time together. I guess I'm feeling a bit smothered. You know how much I really enjoy my "me" time...but I do realize, I need to come out of that. I'm not going to give up on him yet though.  Is it selfish of me to want to keep CJ, yet see other people on the side? I mean we haven't technically made it official yet...but I know I shouldn't be seeing other people, it'll only lead to drama. Is that going to stop me...probably not (at least right now anyway). So I guess I'll be being deceitful...but I feel like I need to get this (whatever it is) out of my system. This dishonesty is so not me.  I met this guy Rob on the internet a few weeks ago...but we never met in person. Well, that's going to change tomorrow. He's supposed to come over tomorrow. He was initially going to be a "jumpoff", and still may be...but we'll see. Well I really don't want to discuss this anymore, because I don't like what I'm seeing in myself,  so I'm going to go. I'll holla t
