morning and vacated our crappy motel pretty quickly. My mom had gone out on a walk with Cynthia, her friend who lives locally in San Fransisco, and had just come back when we my sisters and I were waking up. We left our car at the Cynthia's and walked down the Fisherman's Wharf where we caught a tour ferry and rode around the bay for an hour and a half. Then we walked up to Ghiradelli Square, had lunch and stopped in at Cynthia's house for a while. She has a projector, screen and surround sound system in her bedroom! :) :) Exiting the city, we drove down Lombard street (the windiest street in the U.S.).  It took us over 6 hours to drive to LA (well, actually Vernonia - an LA suburb that Six Flags is located in). It's interesting: we've driven  exactly  1000.1 miles from my front door to the front of this hotel... We've got a picture to prove it. :)The hotel that I'm staying's within sight of Six Flags in a major way... it's like the only thing you can see looking out the windows (hehe)  Btw, my sisters and mom are trying to sleep so they kicked me out of the room and into the bathroom where I'm finishing up this post now ;)

This is getting pretty rediculous... We reserved a room with this hotel here but they somehow overbooked, so they sent us to another hotel which didn't have room either, so now we're back again and have been wating for... over an hour... this is really starting to piss me off.
Well, here we are screaming down the road at over 100mph.. My mom's at the wheel and it feels like we've got a couple jatos strapped to our butt. Our average speed's been around 85-90 the  entire way  out of Portland. It seems the max we've had to slow down had been to 70 in heavy ish  traffic. A bit ago we stopped in Redding to change our windshield wipers (yes, it was actually raining earlier, though the windshield's been coated with an enzime that stops rain from sticking so you almost don't even need the wipers). I picked up a pair of sunglasses for 99 cents (hehe). If they last me the rest of the week, they'll have been worth it.  Btw, I've had my eyes closed for most of this post... (spl check works wonders)
Listening to:  Unwritten Law - Blame it on Me   Well, we're sitting here in the car on the highway just south of Roseburg... sitting, not really driving. (lol) The bright orange "Wreck Ahead" signs littering the side of the road and the fact that the left lane's blocked off with cones offers some explanation as to why.   This laptop's starting to become an annoying weight on my legs so I might put it down soon but I don't really feel like it yet.  Yeah, we just passed the accident site... from the looks of it, a 'fifth wheel' camper came off its frame and fell onto the r
