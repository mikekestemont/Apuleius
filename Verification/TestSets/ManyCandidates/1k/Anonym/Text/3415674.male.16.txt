the rest, fuck the test Always play the game on the edge I’m not insane, cause you see my point I stand my ground, only to avoid. Face the fact that your angel of lead Wont give you the advantage here  Theres a point I’d like to prove But you just pull away From me...  Storm their homes, raid their lives The more you take the more you die Feel the rain crash down on your soul Now ask why as you lose control Reverse the tide, start to slide Reap the worst you Jeckyll & Hyde  You are the anti-christ You are the bullshit Don’t concern me with making profit I see, and I believe But you just nuture my disease
Wish I would have called you Wish I would have done something Wish I could have shown you that That life is so much more Than bleeding into nothing Your picture still haunts me It tries to tell me that you're alright Mabye I should believe it, and follow you.
Am I nothing to you anymore? Did all the feelings just pack up And leave me for better? I can see you breathing now I can see you bleeding out Or is it just me? Your echo, it still resides In(side) my head, it won't subside Would you just, look at me before I die?
okay, I still have a damn writers block knotting itself more and more in my brain but I found some older stuff I wrote at school sometimes to pass boredom in science and socials when I had nothing to do when I actually did my work, so here it is.    (nameless)   Packing memories in suitcases And throwing them into the ocean Leaves me free to be opened and broken I say I wont let them get to me anymore But I know its too early I have the awnsers to their questions But I wont let them know the truth disconnected, for what I shouldent be   Numb   Everyday is colder, my body is growing numb I've never felt like this before It feels like nothing can be done I look at all the photographs Of summers that have passed and remember all the memories and all the times that we laughed but then the clouds came again and I wish that it would snow and I wish that you would be mine again but this game is growing old.   Gone   I see through you Like you see through me We play this game but we never leave All I know is that I can't control My soul inside/I'm letting go  Look away cause I'm not here Insignificant for many years The shell is strong The love is gone So I'll stay here like I always have but I wish I could reach out and destroy the past  Ink stains the hands as a reminder of the past toxic like the memories I wish I didn't have.
again, writers block, I hate it... every night I try to write something but nothing comes out... well, anything that isn't c
