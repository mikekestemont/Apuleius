 =)  Then went to look for Mrs. Lewis with Kailing (never found her) and went to go look for Mrs. Wendle (didn't find her, either).  French:  HORRID. But at least Gould can speak French better than Alexander.  People: Ning, Andrew T, Kathryn S, Tavvy, Andrew Chang, Ramon, Leslie H.  Not bad, all in all.  Lunch: I LOVE YOU, YINI.  THANK GOODNESS YOU HAVE ENGLISH SECOND.  PE: I ACTUALLY KNEW PEOPLE.  I was so happy.  We had the choice to dress out or to not dress out and spend the day playing games with the special ed children.  I chose to dress out.  And this is for the rest of the semester.  But then if you do the special ed thing, no time to do hw.  So yeah.  Hw time outside of home is very important.  People: Christina C, Megan S, Angela C (who apparently remembers me from first grade, but I can't remember her...), Jennifer F, Kim.  Not bad, for PE.  =)  Chemistry:  Biguenet's voice is... annoying.  It grates on my nerves.  And I think there was something wrong with our experiment, because we got 5 NRs....  But I heard that happened to lots of other groups, too, so I'm not TOO worried.  Lots of people: Meng, Andrew C, Su, Stacey, Grace Y, Gary, Qin, Ning, and someone else whom I've forgotten...  AP Human Geography:  OH MY GOD.  THIS CLASS...  TOOOO MANY PEOPLE.  There are TWO white people in the entire 36-student class.  Mr. Stanton popped his head in and said, "Oh, boy."  hahahaha.  When I told Roelofs I went by Sunshine, someone started whistling "You Are My Sunshine".  It was... interesting.  People:  Gabriel, Melanie, Grace Y, Grace C, Lisa W, Qin, Katie Y, Jack W, Irene, Amanda S, Alex A, Bing, Didy, Ning, Chuan.  Oh, I made quasi-amends with Chuan.  Figured it'd be easier, as he sits diagonally behind me in GAP.  (Hahahaha.)  Then I came home, and Mrs. Bartley called me.  B: I talked to Mrs Booth, and she said you wanted to continue with orchestra this year.  Is that true? Me: Yes... B: So why'd you drop it? Me: My parents made me.  I had to take PE, or else I wouldn't graduate in time. B: In a perfect world, would you still want to take orchestra? Me: Yes... (I couldn't very well say no...) B: So would you mind if I go talk to you counselor? Me: No, of course not.  (YES, YOU CRAZY WOMAN, YES.) B: So if we could work something out, would you be willing to join orchestra again? Me: Sure.  (NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO...) B: Because we always have a spot for you in our orchestra family.  You're a really valuable member. Me: Alright.  (I DON'T WANT TO BE A PART OF YOUR "ORCHESTRA FAMILY".) B: Okay, I'll see what I can do tomorrow, then. Me:  Okay!  (NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO....) B: Bye, then! Me: Bye!  (FINALLY.)  NO WAY AM I EVER GOING BACK TO ORCHESTRA.  NO FREAKING WAY.  Anyway.  I'm calm.  Really.  Shorter posts now that school's started.  Will of course, post everyday from now on, though.  =
