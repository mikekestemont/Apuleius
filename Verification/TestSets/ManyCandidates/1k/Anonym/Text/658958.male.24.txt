urlLink dvspot review: Canon Optura 20
So I keep forgetting that today is April Fools Day, but I did remember long enough to play a little joke on  urlLink my sister .  Lindsey's friend had a baby last night, and Lindsey borrowed my camera to take some pictures of the baby.  Tonight she was asking me to send the pictures to her.  That is when we had this AIM conversation (which has been edited for content as well as to cover up my inabilaty to spell):   Session Start (NatoriousFAT:carebeardillon): Thu Apr 01 19:02:26 2004   carebeardillon:  hey can you PLEASE send me those pictures i took last night?!?  NatoriousFAT:  well crap  NatoriousFAT:  somehow they got erased off of my camera  carebeardillon:  WHAT?!?!  carebeardillon:  no they didn't...  NatoriousFAT:  i dont know  carebeardillon:  they can't  NatoriousFAT:  i have the pictures of zach on there  NatoriousFAT:  but nothing else  carebeardillon:  nate  carebeardillon:  stop it  carebeardillon:  please send them to me  NatoriousFAT:  stop what?  i'm being serious!  NatoriousFAT:  i can send you the pictures of zach's hair, but you dont want those do you?  carebeardillon:  well send them with the pictures of corben  NatoriousFAT:  that's all i have!  carebeardillon:  nate!  NatoriousFAT:  wait, here is the problem  NatoriousFAT:  i dont think you took any pictures  carebeardillon:  yes i did!  NatoriousFAT:  look at this  carebeardillon:  there were 7 of them  NatoriousFAT:  this is the last picture i took with my camera  *** carebeardillon has received IMG_2890.JPG.   NatoriousFAT:  and this is the first picture that was on there from last night  *** carebeardillon has received IMG_2891.JPG.   NatoriousFAT:  it is a picture of zach  carebeardillon:  nate stop it!  NatoriousFAT:  the numbers go from 2890 to 2891  NatoriousFAT:  that means that there were no pictures taken in between  carebeardillon:  that's not funny  carebeardillon:  fix it  NatoriousFAT:  how can i fix it???????  carebeardillon:  find them please  NatoriousFAT:  there is nothing to find  carebeardillon:  zach was messing with it  NatoriousFAT:  i copied all of the pictures from my card to my computer  NatoriousFAT:  and that's all i have!  carebeardillon:  ahhhhhhhhhhhhhkhsahaaaaaaaaaaakhfkaljadsjfklasjgahkldfkahklfhaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  carebeardillon:  >:o  NatoriousFAT:  what is that supposed to mean?  carebeardillon:  i am angry!  NatoriousFAT:  at me?  carebeardillon:  at the situation  NatoriousFAT:  what am i supposed to do about it?  carebeardillon:  i don't know  NatoriousFAT:  they were just pictures  NatoriousFAT:  it's not the end of the world  NatoriousFAT:  i think you need to calm down  NatoriousFAT:  and remember what day it is...  carebeardillon:  uh they were the only pictures i have of my best friends baby that i waited and waited and lost sleep over  carebeardillon:  i won't get to see him again for at least 2 weeks or more  carebeardillon:  and he will look different then  NatoriousFAT:  ok, and what day is it today?  carebeardillon:  ahhhhhhhhhhhhhdklfhalkfhksdfhlj!  carebeardillon:  i am so mad at you!
