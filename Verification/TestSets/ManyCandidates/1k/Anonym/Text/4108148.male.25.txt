can get enough done to have this coming weekend off.    I've been on this weird AM radio kick lately.  It just seems like there are no good call in shows anymore on FM, and that local talk radio is dying for the most part.  I was listening to a show where people would call in with the best life lessons they have. One of the least profound was that some guy called up and said his was "Always keep your beer cold".    I did go to the track today!  Tony wants me to do a bit at a time to build strength and test my tendon to see how it feels.  Track, watch out!  You are going down!
Last Night, I went out to work on getting some play in the work to play ratio.  I went out with Ms B and her BF, and ielle.  Then, I saw Nothing, R, Enser, Pam, Alan(Happy B-day buddy!), Clint, Jermaine, Tommy, and Chrissy out.  It was a great times.  After working my booty off without much fun time lately, I definitely needed the break.  It was good to catch up with K-lo over the phone too earlier.  With only about a week left of putting in extra time for work, I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel.  After this, I plan on catching up with everyone more.

I remember as a kid I would ask my mother how long it would be before dinner or something along that line.

Now, when I think about something being an hour away, I think what short time I have, and how an hour never seems like enough time to get whatever done before its on to the next thing.  My grandmother tells me that for her the years now pass by as days did when she was a young child.  It makes me feel that we need to slow things down and value what we have.  After all, time is not an endless well.  I've been thinking a lot lately on the concept of lust.  I am inclined to think that something about our society and culture is lust driven.  Maybe, its part of the American myth of being bigger, faster, stronger, newer, and then that trickles down into our daily personal  beliefs.  It just seems like the advertising agencies and other areas take advantage of this.  I could really go off on this, but just think how you lust for fast food, or how people lust for the images of two dimensional characters on the silver screen.  Does this sow the seeds of internal discontent along the masses by making people dissatsified with themselves and their l
