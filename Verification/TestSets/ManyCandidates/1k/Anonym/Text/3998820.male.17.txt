desk and ask him if anyone ever drowned here?&nbsp; It seemed a bit grim, but I figured I had nothing to lose.&nbsp; I had come all this way.&nbsp; I should just put this thing to rest.&nbsp; I approached him.&nbsp; "Good afternoon, sir," I said.&nbsp; "Good afternoon," he replied, "may I help you with something?"&nbsp; "Yes," I said, "I know this is a bit of an odd question, but has anyone ever drowned in this lake?"&nbsp; He looked at me, obviously surprised.&nbsp; "Funny you should ask," the old man said, "If my memory serves me correctly, it's been eighty years this week since the only two drownings on record occurred here.&nbsp; I was a kid then, but I remember it.&nbsp; It was a big deal in this town.&nbsp; Two teenagers drowned.&nbsp; One jumped off the sailboat they were on, and then the other tried to save him.&nbsp;Everyone who was on that boat is dead now I think.&nbsp;&nbsp;From what I heard, they all went to their graves&nbsp;with much guilt hanging over them.&nbsp; The kid who tried to save the other one, his death could have been prevented.&nbsp; He was still above the water, but his friends headed back to shore, leaving him to die.&nbsp;&nbsp;They initially blamed&nbsp;it on the&nbsp;booze they drank that night, but they&nbsp;later blamed themselves.&nbsp; I don't&nbsp;believe any of them ever&nbsp;accepted it.&nbsp; It's a sad story."&nbsp; I stood there shocked.&nbsp; I was incredulous.&nbsp; I&nbsp;thanked him, turned around, and&nbsp;headed out the door.&nbsp; I took one more look at the lake, and then got into my car.&nbsp; I didn't like the feeling I was getting there.    I decided that I would try and find the town's cemetery.&nbsp;&nbsp;That had to be where those two were buried.&nbsp;&nbsp;I drove around for roughly a half an hour until I finally found it.&nbsp; It was nestled in the woods, on the outskirts of the town.&nbsp; It wasn't a big cemetery at all.&nbsp; It was hilly though.&nbsp; I drove up and down the hills, looking for those elm trees.&nbsp; Then I saw them.&nbsp; I parked the car and got out.&nbsp; I ran over to that hill and walked up it, examining each stone.&nbsp; For twenty minutes I looked and looked.&nbsp; Suddenly, I saw a stone with the name James on it.&nbsp; "James Edward Turner" it read.&nbsp; The date of birth was June 16, 1905.&nbsp; The date of death was July 28, 1924.&nbsp; It was him, no doubt in my mind.&nbsp; I stood there for a minute and took it all in.&nbsp; Then I continued searching for the other one, the one I had been.&nbsp; A few minutes later, out of the corner of my eye, I saw it.&nbsp; The stone read "Henry Gerald Thomas."&nbsp; Unbelievable.&nbsp; Absolutely unbelievable.&nbsp; The feeling that came over me at that minute can't be put into words.&nbsp; I looked at the dates of birth and death "May 28, 1905 - July 28, 1924."&nbsp;    I sat down on the grave for a few minutes, and closed my eyes.&nbsp; I saw nothing in my mind.&nbsp; There was nothing for me to say.&nbsp; I stood up and left.      &
