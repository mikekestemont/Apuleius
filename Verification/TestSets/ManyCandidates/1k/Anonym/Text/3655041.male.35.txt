no on seems to stay on one team for very long… and how the Red Sox futility has gone back a long time.  In 1918 my Grandparents were still infants.  The world was just coming out of the ravages of the Great War (later history would label it World War I).  The Titanic disaster was still as fresh in people’s minds as 9-11 is in ours.  The roaring twenties hadn’t happened yet.  And George Herman Ruth was a still pitching for Beantown.  In September of 1918 the Boston Red Sox had just won the World Series of Baseball.  Their owner decided he needed an infusion of cash to finance his other business ventures.  He sent Babe Ruth packing to the New York Yankees for something like $100,000.  That is still a lot of money.  In 1918 it was a fortune.  The money was actually used to fund a play on Broadway in, of course, New York City.  1918…12 years before the stock market crash.  Forty-two years before John F. Kennedy was elected President.  Forty-five before he was un-elected.  Fifty years before a man walked on the moon.  And the last time the Red Sox won the World Series.  It’s called The Curse of the Bambino (one of Babe Ruth’s numerous colorful nicknames).   They haven’t won a championship since he was sold to the hated Yankees.  Hell, they sure have come close enough.  Since last winning, the Sox have lost in the 7th game of the Series on four occasions.  They were one strike away from winning it all in 1986.  One strike.  And things fell apart once again.  The most infamous incident in that horrid 6th game breakdown being the ball that got between Bill Buckner’s legs.  Never mind that he had a splendid career in the major leagues.  He will always be known as the goat that cost the Red Sox the World Series.  But I submit that if the owners are given accolades when their team wins, they should  also  be given the blame when they aren’t successful.   I watched Nomar Garciaparra play today.  I saw the crowd at Wrigley Field give him a standing ovation as he made his debut in his blue Chicago Cubs uniform.  He had a hit and an RBI in the Cubs victory. At the same time Boston played a game in Minnesota - and lost, when the player they traded for booted a ball and cost them the winning run in the bottom of the ninth.   If teams are going to continue to give up their talented and, even more importantly,  popular  players, how are they ever going to win a championship?  Curses aside, when you make dumb moves like that maybe you don’t deserve to win.  Chicago could very easily take the World Series this year, then making the Red Sox owners look even more red in the face.  But it would be nice for Chicago.   While it is true that Boston hasn’t won the World Series since 1918, Cubs fans have waited even longer - their last was in 1908!  ~
