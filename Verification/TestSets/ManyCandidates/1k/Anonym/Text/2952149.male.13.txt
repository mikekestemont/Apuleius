that fun. All I do is sit around, watch T.V, and play videogames. Maybe once and I while I will hang out with some friends but that is rare. So...ya nothin else to say....
The Tampa Bay Lightning won the Stanley Cup! Yeah that kicks ass! Sorry I haven't posted in a while but yeah....not much has happened and it has been a boring summer....ciao for now. "Equal rights for southern whites"....Im lovin it lol.
Today was kinda boring. I was looking forward to having a relaxing day but of course I knew that wasn't gonna happen and while I was on the computer my mom went to go to the bank and the car wouldn't start. So then we hed to wait for the tow truck dude to come and THEN we had to go to the car place and wait for TWO HOURS until it was ready. Then when I finally got home I was able to relax. I talked to Stacey on the phone and on AOL and I also talked to Stacey's friend Brittany. She seems pretty nice and I am always happy to make a new friend lol. Well thats pretty much it today. Bye.
Sorry that I haven't posted for a while....we think the computer has a virus. The computer is working right now tho....but I am making no promises lol. I really want to call Stacey but whenever I have free time it is either late at night or I don't have time because we are about to do something....*sigh* oh well. And I would call her now but we are about to watch a DVD...."Scary Movie 3" cuz my parents never saw it lol. Oh and I wen to go see "The Day After Tomorrow"....It was good, the effects and stuff were cool but the story was kinda hmm....weak but it was still good and y'all should go see it.
Hey people. My dad is TRYING to get AOL back on our computer so I should be back soon. Im at the library right now so thats how I am on. Even though I haven't posted in a while I really have nothing to talk about lol. I am learning to play "Slither" by Velvet Revolver....I really like that band and especially that song. You gotta love Guns n' Roses lol. I have probably purchased like 10 CD's since I last wrote in my blog......Slipknot,Velvet Revolver, Best of Guns n' Roses, and some others. I talked to Stacey yesterday to get her address because her B-day is comin up so I knew where to send like a card or something. I spent the night at Chad's house the other night and we had tacos for dinner and we both put a whole shit load of tobasco sauce on them and...yeah...it wasn't too fun lol. Great pain inside my mouth...lets just say that. Well thats all that I can remember to talk about so hopefully my internet at home will be working soon or else I will just have to come back to this G-d damn library p
