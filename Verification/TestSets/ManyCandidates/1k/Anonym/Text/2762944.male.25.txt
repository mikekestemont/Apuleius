keep stock  With a tick-tock rhythm and a bump for the drop  And then I bumped up  I took the hit I was given  Then I bumped again  And then I bumped again, I said  How do I get back there to  The place where I fell asleep inside you?  How do I get myself back to  The place where you said   I want something else  to get me through this  Semi-charmed kinda life baby, baby I want something else  I'm not listening when you say  good-bye   I believe in the sand beneath my toes  The beach gives a feeling  An earthy feeling  I believe in the faith that grows  And the four right chords can make me cry  When I'm with you I feel like I could die  And that would be all right  All right   And When the plane came in  She said she was crashing  The velvet it rips  In the city we tripped  On the urge to feel alive  But now I'm struggling to survive  Those days you were wearing  That velvet dress  You're the priestess, I must confess  Those little red panties  They pass the test  So slide up around the belly  Face down on the mattress   One   Now you hold me  And we're broken  Still its all that I want to do just a little now,  Feel myself with a head made of the ground  I'm scared but I'm not coming down, no no And I won't run for my life  She's got her jaws just locked now in smile  but nothing is all right  All right   I want something else  To get me through this  Semi charmed kind of life  I want something else  I'm not listening when you say  Good-bye
... until my birthday, so if you haven't already bought me a present then hop to it eh!!  Meanwhile, in other news :  The Broncos actually beat a team lower than them in the premiership on Sunday.  Karmichael Hunt scored four tries, which is a big boost to my fantasy team on Virtual NRL.  We won 60-24 this week and still lead the table as the highest scoring and best defensive team.  Go Ridley Revolution go!!  State of Origin is tomorrow, and the only thing that worries me about Queensland's chances are that they have never won at Telstra Stadium in 7 or 8 attempts.  Darren Lockyer is the key and if he is on his game (gut feel is he will be) the Queensland will get home.  Australia beat Sri Lanka in the cricket test in Darwin and it was great to see Michael Kasprowicz take seven wickets in the second innings.  Hopefully a better batting pitch in Cairns will make the second game more of a contest.  Haha, now this is funny ... was at work yesterday and they filmed a TV commercial to air up here and I get to be the main person in it ... lucky me, especially since I had been working for ten hours at the time and looked like shit.  Sheesh.  More later ... enjoy .
