downtown.  Instead he was an ass and told me that he had to pick up his female boss and that Rob could pick me up and then meet him down at Dave and Busters.  PARDON?  I made a smart ass remark like, “oh, so then you want me to be the designated driver?"  And he replied, “Well, you and Rob need to figure that out."  OUCH!  I guess Rob and I were asked to be the DD and pretty much be his bitch.  I played along and acted as if Rob was my date the entire night.  He introduced me as his girlfriend but treated me like trash.  Yah wasn't really feeling the love.  I acted aloof all night and actually ended up having a good time with Rob and John.  We met up with my girlfriend Carolyn and enjoyed our evening.  JD actually had the balls to ask me if I would take this girl home to her hotel and then drive his car to my home.  I initially said yes, but then found out that JD would not be riding with us and that I would have to drive his car alone to my house and then have to pick up his sorry ass the next morning early.  NO FUCKING THANKS!  Thanks for asking.  I pulled him aside and said that I didn't feel comfortable toting this girl's ass around.  I didn't even know this lady.

Didn't find any but found a HUGE home with 4 levels and 2 wine cellars.  It was amazing.  Brenda and Dave called and Bren broke the news that they had gotten engaged!  I then attempted to call JD again, and we made plans to go over to see the couple.  JD never called.  After several hours I called again and he ended up just wanting to meet over at Dave and Bren’s house.  ASS.  We met over there and JD was an ass.  Bren's ring is amazing.  I can't wait to help plan the wedding and reception!  YEE HAW!  JD and I talked in his car for almost an hour on Bren's driveway.  He thinks we rushed into things and that maybe we need a break.  Huh.  Not what he said a few weeks ago.  Wonder why he had a change of heart?  Wonder what the fuck is going on?  I will fill you in on Friday when he returns to Denver.  ARG  What should I d
