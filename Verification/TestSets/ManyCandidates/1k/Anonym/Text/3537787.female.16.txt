path onto which I do not wish to go I question who I will be in life and what I am to know  I fall short of all my dreams and aspirations too All so helpless and incomplete I don't know what to do  Completely unsafe and not sure if I have the stuff to make the cut When I drive too fast and keep shifting gears I throw myself in the rut  I think of all the good people and blessings in my life And how I don't deserve them all when I fill my world with strife  It is I who makes my trials and I will break them too For I see the sun and feel the light when I think of you  You show me to those open doors and lead me to the sun When I've given up for good, with you I've just begun  Freshly new and waiting to go, a melting of the heart A sunny day even when it rains, a clean slate, a brand new start  I know I can do anything when you wrap me in your love The bluest sky cannot compare to my guidance from above  Each experience brings me joy, for I don't know what's in store It's all because you love me and so I know I can do more
If the sun could shine brighter still It would carry me away If the joy in my heart could overfill It would do so every day  If I could laugh a thousand times too clear So you could feel it too I'd do so without hesitating I'd give my light to you  I feel like I'm sitting on a cloud Light as I can be And the wind on my face drowns out the crowd It's just the breeze and me  We're dancing away without a care Or a worry in the world No one can stop us, we are too free Mr. Wind and the golden girl  Diamonds and yellow and white tipped wings Seem to burst from the lids of my eyes I don't mind for the rain, for it's going to shimmer Each morning and night a surprise  Under the exterior of the house, in the wall Is magic and fantasy, and love It's divine intervention that chases the clouds A substance that comes from above  It all happened in a valley, on a quiet street Where the girl spent each solitary day Then things started to change, and her dreams rearranged When her heart turned outwards to pray
You wonder about me Where I am coming from Why I feel the way I feel But that is a mystery  A mystery is a mystery And will remain to be so There is part of me you can't see Except the way I wish to express it  Hello world I'm writing you a letter You're not listening Just asking questions  So see me See who I am Go with the flow and read between the lines You still won't see whose there But she'll see y
