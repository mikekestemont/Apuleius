European town with cobble-stone side streets. Three years here and then to Colorado Springs, high school graduation and subsequent college days in Greeley, Colorado. What a strange adventure so far...  Then came a year in Northern Ireland, another four seasons in Colorado and the departure to Niger, West Africa.  There are too many stories to tell, to many emotions to go with each place and time... so many secrets that I will have to keep to myself for now.
He didn't have much except vague snapshots of memory from time before then. He'd only heard stories of him crossing the busy four lanes of mainstreet traffic, clad only in a diaper, in order to climb up on the gleaming red tracktor parked in the sale lot across the street. He remembered the shine of the bright red paint that he could almost taste as he gazed at it in infantile wonderment, the feel of the hot vinyl seat he sat in when they were around to prop him up there, the hard steeling wheel.

That was the universe he'd arrived in and that would frame on some level the rest of his experiences in life.  They often laughed over those stories during the breif time they had to spend together during the rare holidays when the family was all together and the Denver sky was bright blue as leaves rustled or snow fell slowly over the ground.

Secluded and unknown to the rest of the world, it was to him infinate. He climbed around on long-abandoned and rusted Japanese army tanks and tiptoed along the jungle paths that led to empty, cracked and potholed roads where frogs slept in warm puddles. He explored his world with the lust for adventure that lives inside every child who has discovered the limitless possibilites of how far his bare feet can take h
