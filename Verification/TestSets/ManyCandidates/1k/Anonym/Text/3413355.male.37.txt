something."   In Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, about 260 miles to the east, Dick Haugen said he was driving to work at KVMI Radio when he saw a flash that he took to be lightning about 2:40 a.m. - then learned there were no lightning storms anywhere in the region.   Ralph Gaume, head of astronometry at the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., said he knew of no likely source from outer space, such as a passing comet or meteor cluster or shower, but added that meteors commonly appear at random. Another possibility, he said, would be "space junk" such as spent rocket engines or satellites falling from Earth orbit.   Astronometry is the branch of astronomy that measures the size and location of celestial objects.   The Skinny On Meteors/Meteorites By: Scott Sistek, KOMO Weather Producer   While nothing has been confirmed as the source of the flashes and explosions, the reports are consistent with a meteor explosion in the upper atmosphere.   There are trillions of dust particles and tiny rocks floating in outer space. The good news is, the Earth's atmosphere protects us by making sure those objects burn up before they reach the ground.   Some of the particles are moving at a very fast speed, plus the Earth is moving at roughly 67,000 mph as it orbits the sun. As the object goes from the void of outer space and enters the outer fringe of the atmosphere, the friction from the air resistance causes the object to heat up -- much like how your foot feels warm when you drag it along a carpet.   The combined speed of the object plus the intense amount of braking force the Earth's air provides causes the objects to heat to incredible temperatures, burning them up before they get anywhere near the ground.   However, if the objects are larger, it can take longer for them to burn up. What might have happened here is you had a rock or something that was large enough so that instead of disintegrating in the first seconds when it hit the atmosphere, it managed to survive in one piece quite a ways until its temperature reached a critical point and the rock just exploded in the sky. That would also explain the thunderous sounds, and why there was a significant delay between the flash and the boom (sound travels at only 700 mph, and figure 5 seconds for each mile away.)   You can see this general process any time there's a meteor shower. Those occur when the Earth enters dust trials from past comets and those tiny particles burn up upon reaching the atmosphere, making those gorgeous streaks across the sky. Sounds like this object might have been larger, though.   In checking, we are in the initial stages of a weak meteor shower -- the June Aquilids -- but there's no word if the two events are related.   There are rare occasions when the rocks survive the atmosphere and can strike the Earth's ground (those would be called "meteroites") but we don't have any reports of that happening in this c
