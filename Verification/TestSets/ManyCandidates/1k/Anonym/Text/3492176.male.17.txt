 Bill, thanks for the Hybrid CD, and for lending me "The Butterfly Effect" I'll be re-watching that with Guy today. I'll burn Frou Frou's "Details" album for you.
Few updates. Today I woke up at 12pm and I ate fried eggz & bagel with philly cream cheese. Sooo good. I watched some tv, I surfed some net...then Tom called at like 2:45, and told me he's coming over. I called my mom to check if we're doing my physical today - she said no. So, when TOm came I showed him my house and he liked it. We went to some place with lotsa gravel and Tom showed me what a 'shitty' looks like...that was fun! then we got to hs house, noone was there. So, we went to some auto body shop past the middle school. He got some tag replaced. We got back, and there was his cousin and 4 kids I don't know of, 2 are from Florida. So we tubed, for a while, then wakeboarded, then we went on another boat, wakeboarded there (I didn't wakeboard) at about 7, we got in the house and ate some good food Tom's mom made. We went down, and I played some games (Ghost Recon, Wrestlemania X8, and Rogue Squadron II) then Chris &amp; Bob came in (I don't know the reason). Then they left. Tom took me home at 10:30pm  And now, Im feeling kinda tired, headache, not good. My ears feel hot, must be the sun.  Tomorrow we suppose to do something with Bill, which I'm looking forward to.  -0- : listening to Sasha &amp; James Zabiela on Annie Nightingale show. Good mixxxx - but I feel down...don't know why.
Ok, now this was fuckin' gay. I leave the school tennis courts with my mom, and then we start having a conversation about how my mom takes all the humor so seriousely with me. So I get mad at that shit, and dont realize i'm goin 43 on 30. So i get fuckin' pulled over for the first time. So fuckin' gay. I'm never gonna drive with my mom together again, it seems that every time I'm behind the wheel she always criticizes my driving, and it makes me really mad. I know she cares for me - but she needs to lighten up!
I just got back home from Plymouth, we went to the 9:55 show. Well, first thing, I already knew the twist (I asked for it). So watching the movie with knowing the twist - wasn't that interesting. The movie is fair, certainly isn't Shyamalan's best work - The Sixth Sense will remain his best. There should've been more creature scenes. It did look fucked up! There was a lot of talking scenes but hey, it's a movie, it has a story, dialogue matters. Can't complain there, but M. Night could've at least spiced it up somehow, he's the genius and all! Some great acting, Bryce Howard, did wonderful. Joaquin was great. The movie's pretty okay-ish. I can understand why it gets bad reviews though. Overall 6/10 r
