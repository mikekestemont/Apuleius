Hey there! Sup everybody? I'm just listening to Ashlee Simpson!! Today has been ok I guess. I didn't really do anything besides go to walmart and buy a cd. I called Zach to see if him and Brett could go skate at the High School, but Zach couldn't. Last night me and Liz went to Zach's to skate. I like skating better than skateboarding.. it's cool. I used Liz's old ones and they are bad, but oh well..lol. I can do a toe/heel mannual!! Hmmm.... I don't know what the heck else to say, oh yeah!! Zach gave me this cute ankle bracelet and he also gave me a t-shirt that is so totally awesome..lol. ;)

I saw the movies "The Terminal" and "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban". They are good good movies!! ;) I talked to Zach and I bought him stuff. I missed him soo soo soo much!! He is on vaca now and won't be back til the 20th of July which isn't bad, but I haven't seen him for about a month. Brett is over at my house right now and him and Liz are playing a game on the xbox. I don't really know  what else to say.. sooooo later gators!!!!
