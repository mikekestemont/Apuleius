 well, this was short as far as my blogs go but that's cuz I didn't have much to talk about. Oh well...^ ^;;
Xenosaga....Xenosaga... your graphics are pretty and your sound is good too, you plotlines good in the beginning, but in the end stink like poo. (tch...least it rhymes...)  How could you go wrong Xenosaga? You had all the makings of a good game. Good graphics, good sound, amazing cimatics, basic RPG characters (smart chick, main heroine, tough male figure, etc.) and even a couple of girls in skimpy outfits so that guys would actually play it. It is sooo good to play, but in the end things kinda fall apart.  It's still an excellent game, but man do the plot ideas in the end SUCK. A guy who looks like a 12 year old who is really a synthetic human (kind of a humanoid robot) loses his 12 year old girlfriend, also a synthetic human. They go to get her back, for she has been kidnapped by some pyshco who can regenerate anything(I mean anything. Head, arm, leg, anything) ,and thus some DBZ remnicient yelling and power-upping ensue.   Then a dude with a crow-like mask and purple (yes, PURPLE) sith cape thing show up. Then the crazy limb regenerating dude runs away in his mecha( I like his mecha a lot. It has wings on it and it is HUGE. so pretty ^_^) But it is just such a weird thing because NONE of this focuses on the real main girl, Shion Uzuki. In fact, it just focuses on the 12 year olds. Now I don't know about you, but cute stuff, for the most part, nausiates me. This is cute angst. This is so nausiating I wished my dad didn't keep locks on the gun cabinet.   Yes, it's that cute.   But don't forget the human rights and environmentalist stuff! Oh yes, play this game and you get to hear Shion spout off every five seconds on how these sythetic humans and androids and cyborgs should be treated as equals, and how you can't  take the life of another human and blah blah blah...   I don't play a game to get nagged at. I play it for the pure entertainment. Not for the morals.   This brings me to why I am so happy they made KOS-MOS, the android, the way she is. 1) She is probably the strongest fighter in the game. That's pretty much a first for any female in games. And 2) She is a ruthless killing machine. You get in her line of fire while she is fighting and you better be praying for your soul. And she never stops in a fight. If she runs out of ammo with a gun, she beat people off with it. She really doesn't have much emotion. She is cold as 0 degrees kelvin most of the time. Sometimes she is somewhat nice and sympathetic, but that is pretty rare.   I give Xenosaga a 4/5  Mood of the Day: 1x2 supportive Bishie of the Day: Balmung of the Azure S
