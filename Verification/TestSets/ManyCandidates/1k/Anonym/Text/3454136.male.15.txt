on telling u what I no about her. But, I won't. =D.  It's so strange sometimes, how a total stranger can become such an important person in ur life in an instant. I really enjoy talking to her. More so than perhaps even my closest friends(that doesn't mean I don't love u anymore... u no what I mean). Maybe it's because she's a total stranger. If I had to open up to someone who nos me, I'd have to get them to unlearn what they already think they no about me first. But to Shannon, I can start whereever I want.  I never really went to those online chatrooms, but I wonder if I would've had a similar experience if I did. I don't think so though. It's o so difficult to find someone who'll accept u as u r. I've always struggled with that. That's y I thank God for Shannon.  Anyways, almost all my Cotton Yarns are Cloths now. So, cya next time. (Bows and exits)
Hey, everyone, I'm back. I no I haven't posted for quite awhile and I'm sorry about that... But hey, there haven't been comments for my posts for way longer than so y should I feel guilty?  In any case, all I've been doing these days r housework, playing FL, SCII, DDRMAX, watching anime, etc. U no, usual boring summer stuff. Oh ya, I got Soul Calibur II and Unreal Tournament for PS2. Both are oldies by now, but who cares... =D  Yes, there is something interesting today. Yet another revelation. I was pretty upset for awhile... Anyways, I'm just really tired of trying my best and not being good enough. I mean, I spend 45 minutes washing the dishes to the best of my ability only to be yelled at for making a mess. They don't even give me a chance to clean it up... Can't they c that I'm doing the best I can? And that the only thing yelling will do is plant a seed in me that will sprout and make me a just-as-bad parent? Can't they c that?  It's just like gym class. Even the teacher said I tried my best and still gave me a 78. A seventy-eight... U no what that's like?! Admitting I tried my best and then giving me a 78 is like giving someone a Christmas bonus and then firing him. It's the cruelest thing possible. U no what they teach in the early years of school... It's better to aim higher and miss than to aim low and achieve. Well that is total bs. The real world isn't a comforting place that u can survive in just by trying ur best. It's harsh and cruel. There's no conselation prize for trying ur best and failing, just the harsh reality that constantly remind u that u failed. Well, screw this world, I hate it. There's no sin in hating the world, since it's so evil, right?  That felt good. =D. I miss blogging... Anyways, cya soon. And for my sake, someone please post a c
