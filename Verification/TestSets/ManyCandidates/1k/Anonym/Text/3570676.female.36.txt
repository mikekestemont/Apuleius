on a more personal level. Assignments could be posted. This would be great when weather is bad, a student is absent, or students could work ahead if they knew about a planned absence (i.e. vacation). Principals could communicate with teachers during the school day provided each class has a working computer that does connect to the internet. The Bowman Blog could be a catchy name for my blog.
A special welcome to Lynn,Chad, Deborah, and Jerry for creating and posting to the class blog.  I must admit that I wondered what we were about to get into when I was asked about "blogging"!!!  I liked your thoughts about how to use a blog.  Do you have any other ideas about how you would use the blog in your classes?  carol deal
I just created a blog and it was easy.
This the first time I ever heard of blogging. With dial-up access you tend not to spend a lot of time conversing over the internet. I still prefer a telephone or face-to-face conversation - you can't read body language or voice inflection in a blog!  It can serve a purpose but too often we get caught up in the technology bells and whistles and we lose sight of the human social interactions that are being replaced by technology connections.
I must admit that when I saw the directions from the instructor regarding a "blog," I began scratching my head and wondering what the heck she was talking about. I may be a bit behind in this technology-savy world, but I had never heard of it before. After reading further, I discovered that it is very much like a public discussion board or forum...maybe even identical with a unique, eye-catching name for it. I think it's a great idea for people who have similar interests or have some other kind of common bond. I too think it could be a good tool for a class, but it needs to be relevant and useful...not something to use just to say you use it. Teachers must consider the types of, the ages of, and the academic level of students, among other things, before incorporating this resourse, if they want to use it effectively. OK...so I've voiced my opinion and made my post! Now, I'm moving on to something else.  Chad
I have heard of blogging and have often wondered how one could incorporate this technology into the classroom experience in Language Arts.  It seems as if it would be a wonderful way to inspire reflection and dialogue about interaction with text among students but the big question, as always, would be about making it meaningful.  I have to admit that, with a few notable exceptions, my experiments with technology in the classroom have led to somewhat mixed results.  Students either digress too much or get so excited about the minor points of the process (graphics, sound) that real interaction with the content is remote.  I'm wondering if anyone has successfully incorporated blogging into their content area and, if so, how they did it.    Lynn
