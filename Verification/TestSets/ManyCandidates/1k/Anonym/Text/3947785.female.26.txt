rich gringos to ride horses.  She thinks I can get in there as a trainer.  That would be AWESOME.  To get out of an office and back with horses would be a dream come true. I am starting to get excited about the move.  It won't be easy, but nothing worth doing ever is easy.  We are still looking for a place to live, we would prefer a house, but it looks like more apartment life up there.  Hopefully we can at least get a downstairs apartment.  I hate stairs.  This morning Josh brought me a second millipede.  My first one (herbie) hates the second one (kirby) ...  Luckily Kirby is the larger and more placid of the two, so I don't think either one will get hurt. I gave official notice to my boss yesterday, one month's notice.  He is going to promote Sheila, our telemarketer to office manager.  I have a month to train her.  I hope she can do it.  To be honest I have my doubts.  But I am a total control freak, and I sincerely belief that no one can do this job as well as I do.  But Sheila has been here for well over a year, she is loyal, hard working, honest, and she like my boss, is Jewish.  I think if she can master the computer, she'll be ok. Well, it's time to start my work day.  Still trying to learn a new program for my boss, so I can teach it to Sheila.....  And it is NOT user friendly!  Cat
Today I came to work and broke the news to my boss.  I am planning to move.   Married or not, there is a shortage of good men in this world, and I am not about to let Josh get away.  I find a man who adores me as much as I adore him....  and that was pure luck.  I can find another job, especially if my boss writes the letter of recommendation that he told me today he would write.   So the first step has been taken...  Now, I need to sit down with Josh and work out details.   The only bad part of this is Alan is going to start school here in Tucson, and then in a month or two, he will be relocated to a new school.  He's strong and smart ...  and young... and it is for the ultimate stability in the long run.   I love my ex-husband's mother, Debi.  She is a wonderfu person who lives for my daughter.  Debi thinks Ravyn is the best thing since sliced bread.  I'm afraid moving will really hurt Debi, but she has to understand that Grandma's arnt everyday, and that Ravyn and Alan got dealt a bum hand when it came to a father... but Josh is willing to pick up where Jamie didnt bother to even try, and Daddy's are everyday. I know that Debi will cry, and be sad, but it's only 120 miles. She will still see Ravyn a LOT, and it's for the best.  Wish me l
