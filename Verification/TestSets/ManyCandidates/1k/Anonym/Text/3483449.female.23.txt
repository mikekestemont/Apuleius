of posting by adding pictures without any insightfulness (is that a real word?(spellcheck told me that it was not, but it sounds good for now:)).  I received the awesome Chai shipment Chrissy sent me, I can't wait to try it!!! MythicalDude was kind enough to link my blogs to his new blog, so those who choose to read mine, whomever ye may be, check his out as well!  I am trying to convince my husband to go to the Sterling Renaissance Festival this weekend, but I fear that my pleas fall on deaf ears.  We were supposed to go to the Falcon Ridge Folk Festival but some friends backed out and tix prices were way too much to justify going, so again, i am stuck trying to figure out what to do with the weekend.  I feels good to sit down and find a moment to write again... hopefully this will be the start of an ongoing trend to maintain consistency on this thing....I have been researching some interesting topics, so hopefully tomorrow the Chronicles will be updated...if not, it will definitely be Saturday.  Adieu, to those who are nice enough to take time out of their day to read this! Until tomorrow...

Saturday I found out that I am PREGO!!!! (It's in there!).&nbsp; The one bun in the oven (good lord, i hope it is only one!) was confirmed yesterday at the OBGYN and tomorrow I am having my first ultrasound.&nbsp; It still hasn't fully hit me yet.&nbsp; Michael is very excited and proclaimed all weekend "I did it!", that became frustrating after 2 hours.&nbsp; Tonight we are going over to Michael's parents to tell them the joyous news.&nbsp; I am feeling very , very tired but no morning sickness yet, heaven hope that I am one of those lucky women who don't get it, but I am not counting my chickens.&nbsp; Saturday we are going to see Shindell at the Falcon Ridge Folk Festival, I am looking forward to that...might as well start infusing the baby with good music.&nbsp; Time has been scarce lately, which is why it has been rather hard to update this thing, but i&nbsp;hope to work on it more this weekend.&nbsp; Until then...
