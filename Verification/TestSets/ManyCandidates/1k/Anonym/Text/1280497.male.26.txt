Alright, so Alan goes and challenges me with his "I have a post more recent than you." What else can I do but start posting to my blog again? Stanley is great, arching his back and getting mad during the day, but sleeping pretty well at night. He makes eye contact and coos. He smiles and seems to enjoy contact with us. I feel like the King of Spain whenever we have a little cooing conversation, regardless of how silly I undoubtedly look when I'm leaning over him, making cheesy smiley faces at him and emitting falsetto chirps.
I need to be a little more gaunt, now that you mention it. I've long had a desire to be one of those enviable types of people that runs every day or at least consistently, but I haven't. I have run three marathons, but training for those marathons were the only times where I actually ran consistently, and then it was tough. Why aren't scientists looking for the consistency gene? That's pretty much all I need....
Stanley, my son,  learned a new trick today. From lying on his stomach, he pushed himself up on his hands until his head and most of his chest were off the ground. Then, he leaned to the right and let the disproportionate weight of his noggin' turn him over! It was quite a cool thing to see. He's a week shy of three months old, so it's not phenomenal, but it's cool to see. I guess we'll have to start really watching where we put him so he doesn't fall off. Like the roof of the car. And the roof of our house.
Golf is a tricky game. I have come to the realization that if I want to be a bad golfer the rest of my life, the best way to do that is to just play a couple of rounds a week. If the last couple months are any indication, this will guarantee not only mediocrity, but perhaps more ineptitude as time goes by. This promises to be a rewarding way to spend five or six hours a week (or more).  Can you feel the frustration? Well, it's more like a resignation to a given course of action, since I really do want to become good at golf, and so I am going to practice more. But it's so clear that it hurts sometimes. I went and played a couple holes of golf today, thinking I might get some practice, and I did. The problem was, I could have done the same thing in half the time by not even bothering to go out on the course. But playing the official course is always a temptation.  This post isn't very i
