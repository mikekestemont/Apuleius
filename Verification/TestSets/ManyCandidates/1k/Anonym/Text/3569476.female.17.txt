heart So what is home but a relative term For home is where your family is  Each year I meet my family And play my summer away They may not be blood related But they love me just the same So what is family but a relative term For a family is people who love  Each year I go where I am loved And laugh my summer away They may not have a reason but they love me anyway So love is not a relative term Because when I'm loved I'm home
My childhood lies in ruins It is the swing that hangs by one chain And the jungle gym set in pieces on the ground I watch the weeds grow They grow around my memories quickly Covering up the past so easily as time moves on My field is overgrown With grass and dandelions that grow in patches They were with the younger me before she passed I want go back to then When life was simple and fun didn't end But my childhood is still slipping from my grasp My recess is over It been over for years but not forgotten Now it's gone completely, a memory of happier times I cry for my loss of time But I still watch the clock ticking away the days As my last moments are wasted on wishing for more
