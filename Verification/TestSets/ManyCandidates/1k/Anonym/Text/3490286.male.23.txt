moment we learnt Criminal and Civil Procedure back in Semester Three), we had written notes to each other during lectures.  Because we were bored, and it just so happened that the lecture (usually an afternoon lecture, between the hours of two to four) was even more so.  It was mostly gibberish. I would write some greeting and declaration that I was bored, and then passed it to the one sitting next to me. Most of the time it would be my friend Sarah (whose hair I had once liked to mess up, and who liked, in retaliation for my messing up her hair, to kick me in the shin or, if situation permitted, get me into an arm-lock until I tapped). She’d then write an equally similar declaration of boredom on the same piece of paper, and then pushed the said piece of paper back to me.  And this pattern is repeated until the class is dismissed, or until we got bored of it. Whichever comes first. We often came up with wonderful correspondences that way. We don’t write notes to each other anymore, because we are no longer sharing the same classes. And because the time for playful camaraderie during horrendously boring classes is over. Some of us are graduating by the end of this year; most of us had graduated and is now doing the Honors programme.  But those were good days, the early days of law school. When everybody was everybody’s friend and we all got along quite well. Life was a Sunday afternoon picnic by the sea, and we didn’t even realize that it had passed us. Things are different now.  Until I had picked up a piece of paper, and saw Sarah’s handwriting on it, which generally contained our written bickering and other gibberish.  And on another piece of paper was Ilya’s handwriting, declaring that she was bored and am thinking about buying new shoes later today, and is enquiring if I’d like to tag along for the trip. And on yet another, Norwen is stating that he is enjoying the choice view of a particular endowed female colleague. And then a note from Fendy, saying that classes was cancelled.  And Farrah wrote on another piece of paper that she would like a ride home, and would remind me to not forget about it like the last time, or else I’d be treated to a projectile shoe. And then there was a reminder by Aleena to go out and get myself a girlfriend, because all the other girls are worried that I’ve been single for far too long.  Suddenly I had forgotten that time had passed, and I felt as if it was only yesterday. In a way, it was.  We wrote those notes just less than three years ago. It seemed like ages now. Good days, those.  Ah well, now I know why Sarah Kay can feel old and nostalgic despite being only twenty three.  For the record, after searching three boxes of past life, I finally found what I was looking for.  Thank y
