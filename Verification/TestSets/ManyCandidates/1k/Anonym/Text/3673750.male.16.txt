to the cop than "Pity me, I'm black and have money." Now I'm sure we have all seen or heard about the R. Kelly scandal, and then some other rappers occasionally getting imprisoned because "THE'RE BLACK!" No, I'm just kidding everyone...."BECAUSE THEY'RE STUPID!" Now, these are all just my opinions. Judge them as you like. Thank you...and remember, judge wisely.
Ok, so yeah. Sometimes, I can't stand my parents. But I guess we all can sometimes. Not my real Mom though, I love her to death. But ok, it's my Dad and Step Mom. My Dad always fucking yells at me for no reason. He is a dick about everything and i swear he hates me. I found out he does, when a couple of days ago he told me, straight to my face "I'd rather you leave then my wife." Ok, I know you haven't been around in my life for all 17 years, but what the fuck? Found out from my Mom yesterday that he never even wanted kids, only cause his Parents pressured him into it. No wonder he has had so many exwives. He is going on his 4th now, and each and every time he puts them before me and my little brother. Take this. His last wife, Allison, total bitch from hell who had 3 rotten step daughters. They lived with him in this big ass fucking manchine. My brother moves up to live with them. The nasty bitch doesn't want my brother to live in their guest bedroom so they build a bull-shit room in the garage with a bad, a tv, put up with fucking plastered wooden walls. Is that not the biggest hunk of crap you ever heard? Now he is with this girl Gayle. She started off in the beginning being really sweet. But then, she turned out like the rest of them. She's used to living by herself and doesn't like to hear my music or having me around. So then, she bitches to my Dad who then blames it on me, whcih really pisses me of cause she doesn't have the balls to say it to me herself. Then, when she calls a family meeting, she cries about it and becomes all emotional. Well guess what bitch, your not the only one living here!! Even my Dad, who I now hate very much, agrees with me. I woudl move but I have nowhere else to live. I live in a big nice house which has its set backs, but it's better than nowhere. I'll be moving out in 2 years after completing highschool. Thank God! and i'll never have to see them again. I know we all get mad at them every once in a awhile. But do they love or care about me? NO! She told my Dad even that she wants me out, and that it is either me or her! Sorry if I'm swearing do much, but you can see why.  Now, these are all my opinions, just them as you like. Thank you, and remember...judge w
