leh??   more n more ppl r teasing me abt him...  another collegue Tang...said Ur L's outside leh...sure can handle...when i asked him to help out with the customers at the sandwhich bar...
HAiz....  Guess wat I'm most afraid of is going to happen le....  Heard from one of the old witches that he's gonna leave....wat i man here is that he's resigning....  I dunno y but the moment i heard abt it .... i almost ended up in tears.... I curbed myself....but tears just kept welling up.... When i asked Tang abt it.... the qns that poped out of hes mouth was that y are u so concerned if hes leaving not?  Then the next thing i knew was that i saw him confronting the old witch as to y she told me abt it...the reason she gave was that it was better th sooner i knew the better.  Haiz....  that time when i knew abt it was on Sun.... till now i m still not over the shock somehow...  SO SAD!!  I asked him abt it.... is it true that ure leaving on the 18th? I got so down n disappointed that i kind of threw myself into nothing but work.... n refused to look or talk to him for a few hours...  And know wat?? he seemed to understand n let me work out my frustration...  Then when he asked me over to sign for the cashier stuff.... i was kind of ok n asked him if he was coming back to Singapore anymore.... then he began saying that he actually wanted to tell me that very day.... n was very puzzled how the old witch knew abt it....He said that he would be there for at least 3 mths....kaoz....3mths leh....!!!! i missed him loads liao when i dun c him for a few days leh....now that i hear 3mths i wonder how i'll b able to cope with it....  He told me that he ll speak to me later aft work but becos we ended work late....there wasnt a chance to do so...  Now thinking back... i think that that day he wanted to meet up with me was to tell me personally abt his resignation...  When i was home, i msg him to ask if i could go out with him b4 18th not.... his response was v positive but still i was v sad abt the news.... haiz.... guess i kind of took it for granted that he ll be working there forever....  Haiz....im scared of crying during work when i dun c him there...  Though i must say that this cannot b considered the end but .... to think of it manz.... already when hes in Singapore, it is so hard to meet outside of work....wats more hes overseas??  Is it possible to stay in touch??
