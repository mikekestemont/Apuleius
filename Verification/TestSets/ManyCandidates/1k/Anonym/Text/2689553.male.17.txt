much else to talk about...thats pretty much it.
Im sitting here, in the band room, listening to the jazz band perform.  The wind ensemble and the percussion ensmeble have already done their thing.  Unbeknownest to me, however, until tonight, were 2 solos by Goss, our perc director, and Steph Miller, a fellow student of mine.  Although, technically it was a duet for steph, cuz Mrs. Klinger was playing as well.  Personally, I didn't like Goss's piece...it was too...random? yeah, thats the word.  It was "out there", so to speak.  One thing I really dislike about percussion ensemble, and the percussion section in band too, is that only 2 or 3 percussionists get the good parts.  Okay, well, they're all done now, so I'm outta here.
Tonight is the last concert of the season.  And we have 74 days till band camp.  Its gonna be a looong road....i'm gonna go through so much band withdrawal it won't be funny.  Anyway, I guess i SHOULD talk about something not related to band.  Lets see...well, I'm going to the prom with Kristine Smith.  I got her corsage today.  I don't really know her that well, my friend Brenna set us up.  I called her last night, and we talked for like a half-hour. She's a really nice girl, I'll probably call her again tonight after the concert.  Finals are over, so theres a good thing.  Not much else...
urlLink    Okay, so this one here, this one was actually taken before the one with Brenna.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Okay, now we're outside behind Brenna's house.  That's brenna standing next to me.  She was going to go to the prom, but her boyfriend had too many detentions, so she couldn't go.  It's a shame too, she could have had so much fun.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Another picture, this time my mom got out of the way, but now I look really annoyed, or bored or something.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    The first picture that Brenna's mom took.  As you can see, we got our corsage and boutinner(sp?) to match.  And my mom looks kinda ticked in the background, maybe she's upset cuz she couldn't get out of the way in time.&nbsp; urlLink
Well, last night was the prom.  Willow Valley is one of the 10 nicest places I've ever eaten in/danced in.  Of course, its probably #1 on my list of the 10 nicest places I've ever eaten in in Pennsylvania, and since I've only ever actually danced like that twice(the other being post-prom), its #1 on my list of places I've ever danced in.  The food was good, some of the best chicken breast I've ever had.   The dancing, well....I didn't dance to the fast stuff at first, cuz I'm no good at it, and I didn't want to make a fool of myself.  But I did dance with Kristine to the slower stuff.  Post-prom was fun, but got really old around 4-ish.  I put at least  like 10,000 dollars worth of prize vouchers into the bucket for the PS2 and didn't win a thing.  Gotta go now.  At least it was play money. Pictures t
