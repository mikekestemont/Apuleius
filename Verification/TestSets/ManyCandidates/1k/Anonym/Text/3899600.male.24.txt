own life...his own, seperate, not including me life.     I should've known when he said he was a writer.
Hey,      This is the blog where I tell you the reader not to take my stuff too seriously. I think sometimes people write things and they get really worked up over things and get caught up in the moment and they wind up saying or writing things that they look back on and wish they never wrote.     It's kinda like in Jerry Mcquire...he stays up all night long writing this mission statement, thinking it is the right thing to do...then after he wakes up in the morning, he realizes the mistake he has made.     I'm not saying that I think I have written anything really harsh or even that important...it's just that I want to warn people that I might say things that sound preachy...but that's not really the way I feel about things.     One of the things that we often forget is how everyone is so different than eachother...everyone has different goals in life...even different reason for being at the circus. And one of the great things is that each person has something they truly love outside of advertising. I love to read books and watch movies, someone else might love art, someone else might love hip hop, someone else might love sports....the important thing is to realize that everyone is different and those differences are what give us power and individuality in our creativity. Having a passion for anything in life is what will make your work unique...and relevent. Our passions are what help define our voice and give everything we say and write character.     I also think that by writing in this blog, we are sharing a lot about what makes us who we are. And the fact that the class can read it can be a cool thing (letting us all in on the secret of who you are)...but it can also be a dangerous thing. Becuase like I said, sometimes people let their emotions get the best of them and write things that they don't really mean...or wind up coming off as something you really arent. I think that making our blogs public is a priveledge that shouldn't be abused. What people write is often what they cannot say. It is often the very things that sting them the most. It is how some of us vent. It is how some of us warm-up for writing ads. It is how some of us search for the real truths behind creativity. And to use those words written from the heart to hurt another person or to deface another person would be an injustice to what the circus represents. An open community of artists who are here to learn from one another and to push their creativity to the limits by experiencing and writing about it.     We should not forget that by being allowed to read other people's blogs we are being given the ultimate priveledge of getting inside the mind and hearts of our peers. We should always respect t
