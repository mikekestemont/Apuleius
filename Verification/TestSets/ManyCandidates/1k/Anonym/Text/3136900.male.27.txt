 urlLink Jazz in the Square .  urlLink Dave Samuels , formerly of  urlLink Sypro Gyra , was on hand to give notes on stage to school-aged jazz players. The Liverpool High School Jazz Ensemble has some pretty remarkable players, including a fantastic tenor player and a guitarist who is probably playing in some punk band that is boring the hell out of him because  that boy can  play  . We caught the Mood Swings, as well, and then moved on to  urlLink Onondaga Lake Park , where we set out on the walking trail for a little while.  It was on the walking path that Kai and Monica were introduced to the meanness of sea gulls, the seemingly cute, white  jerks  that populate shorelines and mall parking lots. Monica took the leftover bread from Kai’s open-faced steak sandwich and fed it to the gulls, who promptly walked all over each other and pecked at each other as they scavenged for a bite. We then met an even meaner child as we walked by the marina. While his guardian of the moment was on a boat making some adjustments, this kid, who must have been 5 or so, was throwing rocks at a group of ducks, who were sticking around because they evidently thought they were getting food. I’m not sure I’ve ever had as big a desire to grab a kid by his life preserver and throw him in the lake.  We then returned to the jazz festival for some of  urlLink Jon Seiger and the All Stars’  set. Seiger has evidently been studying Louis Armstrong for years, because he’s got Satchmo’s voice  down , which made for a wonderful set of popular jazz. We went back to the apartment for a bit so Monica could meet  urlLink Binky (in the top photo) , and then we headed back downtown for dinner.  We walked into  urlLink Kitty Hoynes , and were greeted by a band setting up in the small bar. We were ushered into a loud but not annoying dining room where we loaded up our bellies on traditional Irish fare: Corned beef and cabbage for me, shepherd’s pie for Monica, and fish and chips for Kai (it all came to less than $30, by the way). Heading out through the bar area, we found that the band,  urlLink Wild Geese , was fun, in a get drunk and sing-a-long way, a la the  urlLink Drunk Stuntmen . Bellies full, we went to a now  packed  Clinton Square for  urlLink Dave Samuels’  set and then headed out.  The lesson here, the appeal, really, is that you find someone with a different cultural background to share experiences with. It’s interesting, rewarding, and gosh darn it, it might even make you a better (or at least more well-rounded) person!  Incidentally, if you made it this far, thanks for reading this post.
