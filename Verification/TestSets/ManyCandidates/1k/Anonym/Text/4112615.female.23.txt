want to get out from Singapore to have some fresh air.life is so stressful here.Planning to go KL for some shopping spree & makan with friends in Sep.I really miss the hokkien mee there .Cant wait to have it now! It's just so yummy!      Two day ago went to watch the movie "Village" with my Pig brother. I thought it's those scary movie that will make me scream, yell and hide under my Tee. But it was just unexpected.Story was really well written .More like a love story to me! Wondering will i do such things for a guy.Cant imagine myself running in the wood alone ..Love is the strangest things in the world . It can kill a person But also can bring ones with happiness ... But no matter it apply to who i will always ask myself " Is he worth it ?"   There's always going to be people that hurt you so what you have to do is keep on trusting and just be more careful about who you trust next time around.No one is worth your tears, and the one who is, won't make you cry...       Finally my papers is over, but i didnt really did well.. just pray hard and hope to get a PASS...

It's been a hard day night. Was resting at home when my brother called and asked me to buy something urgent for him.... I’m dead tired and almost want to faint on my bed.Argghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...trying really hard to drag myself out from my house to causeway point. What to do? He's my brother and I can’t reject him. Happen to drop by Fiesta at causeway, bought the original favour cheesecake for breakfast. Wow it’s smell good!! Feel like taking a small bite now...keke.  Feel great at home now.My eyes hardly open now ...guess I am getting old...no more stamina to stay late at night...  Better tuck in early and got to wake up early to catch my 168 bus .....
