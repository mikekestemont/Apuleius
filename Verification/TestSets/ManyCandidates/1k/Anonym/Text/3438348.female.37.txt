someone else might want to read. There's nothing in my life's experiences that would lead me to this thought. I am not a writer, not a good story-teller, and don't have anything in particular to say.
FireGirl is now sold. And, I don't know who I am, or what I'm supposed to be doing with my life.
My mother called to tell me my stepfather (Carl) is urinating blood. They are making an appointment with a urologist, but in the meantime, she's a nurse, and seems to think it could be one of three things: 1) nothing; 2) prostate - and if it's prostate, it could be something benign, or it could be prostate cancer; or 3) bladder cancer.   To report that Carl is 80 years old is to deliver a not-quite-accurate description. He's healthier than I am. He is fit, trim, in good shape, and in perfectly good health... except for the pissing blood part. Oh, and except for the dizzy spells. About a year ago he started experiencing dizzy spells. The doctors discovered he has a partially blocked artery in his neck. An operation would be very risky, so they've opted not to do it. So, occassionally, he'll be driving along, and will almost pass out. I asked him whether he thinks he's still safe to drive, and he says, "Well, when I start to get dizzy, I pull over." Nice system.   That he is urinating blood is scary. I always expected him to die of... well, maybe I never expected him to die. But, I especially cannot picture him wasting away with some disease. Maybe it's nothing. Or, maybe it's something, but easily curable. Still, having him be sick, even a little bit, will force me to face his mortality. As much as we've disagreed and fought about things over the years, I am definitely not ready for him to die.    I  am not ready for him to die. Yep. It's all about me. What isn't?
I've received two calls about my Beetle. The first call was from a guy who was looking for a diesel version of my car. Mine burns gasoline. The second call was from a salesperson, trying to sell me an ad on  urlLink The Big Lot . I can't say I'm encouranged.  I'm still scheduled to close on the business tomorrow, but the buyers won't get here today in time to count the inventory. We'll have to count tomorrow, but all delays are making me nervous.   Yesterday, I rode my bike 4 miles to a meeting, and then the 4 miles back. I know it doesn't sound like much, but since getting the bike, I haven't been very sure of myself. I am especially not sure about going up hills. So, the longest trip I had taken on the bike up until then was about a mile. Granted, it was a mile that included a VERY STEEP hill, but still, it's just a mile. After going the 4 miles, and then actually making it back, too, I felt strong and capable. I guess it's all r
