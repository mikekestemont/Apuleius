has lots of Bacardi and all that good stuff, we had mad parties in the hot tub (include beverages mentioned above). It was good times.  When Gary got back on Sunday, we basically still did our own thing, which meant shopping a lot and crusin around the city. We did Pier 39 like twice, the wharf, ghiradelli square, chestnut street, we did chinatown twice, Little Italy, the Castro, Haight street. We went to the aquarium and went through those neat little glass tunnels with all the animals all around (I haven't been in one of those in years!), we saw two movies at the Metrion too! We saw the Bourne Supremeacy, which was good, Morgan didn't like it, but I thought it was pretty good. Especially since I never saw the first one, it still made sense. It was all action-ish and whatnot....I liked it. Then a few days later we saw The Villiage! That was the best movie in so long! I really liked it, the ending was so unexpected, it was crazy good. I thought it was awesome. Y'all should see it!  I guess that's all we did, I mean we did a ton more than that, but that's all I can think of right now...but there are lots of good stories y'all can hear later if you ask me! Like when Emily got hit on in the subway by a guy who was cracked out on herion, it was pretty funny. So yah...we conquered the San Francisco. We came home this afternoon, our flight was delayed about 40 minutes or so....(not cool but whatever) and I felt so sick right when we got on the plane. I don't really know why because I'm not afraid of planes or anything, cause I fly all the time, but I think it may have had something to do with the caramel macchiato I got at the starbucks in the terminal. There were these two people of asian descent operating the joint and I'm not sure they really spoke English, and I am positive that they did not know how to properly prepare a beverage. But I drank it anyways, and I think it made me really sick. But after I ate on the plane I felt a lot better! oh yeah, the plane on the way home was one of those tiny little ones that you walk up the stairs to get on to...we got a ramp, but you get it....I've never been on one that small before, crazy...now I have! score.  I'm glad to be home, I always am after a vacation. I mean I never want to come home. Ever. But once I'm home, I'm really happy to be here. Life is so happy here, no worries, just happiness, plus I missed everything...now I'm home. For now.  Plans for this week: --Finish AP book and do that dumb essay --Do nothing else, and sleep in every day --Les Miserables with Emmy on Saturday --Party at Morgans on Sunday  That's my life....like it, or love it. Till later. Good n
