Half way across n we bump into a float.  Swim diagonally and we get kicked by a wild uncivilized leg! Swim vertically and the juniors swim dangerously wif no regards to me who s already half blind by my misty gonna-haf-to-chuck-it goggles! sigh.  Such s the danger both of us haf to face in the pool.  But the sun was fab! I and fiance feel so fab!!  Watching the repeat telecast of Anugerah now.  The RUFFEDGE is it? urm... they're more superb than I tot they were se! My fiance loves them since a long time back.  He's busy studying now.  I wish him well for his term test tomorrow.  His reservist is also tomorrow.  Sigh. I'm gonna miss him again.
