night was pretty much over and I could sleep, but before I could say that, he suggested we rent a movie from blockbuster.&nbsp; Well, of course I agreed! Watching a movie with Joe beats out sleep anyday! So we rented the butterfly effect and sat on the couch and cuddled.&nbsp; Man talk about WONDERFUL!!!! I've been sitting here with a cheesy grin on my face all night long!&nbsp; All my co-workers keep tellin me "gross, yer in LO0O0O0ve"&nbsp; I just giggle and say "thanks!"  &nbsp;  So, except for&nbsp; a few minor set backs, like my ex being an ass, trouble with my car, and failing entrance exams for college, I've still managed to maintain a good outlook on life.&nbsp; And, short of a MAJOR CATASTROPHE, I'm on cloud nine and I plan to stay there for a while.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Soo... off I go.... back to work with my head in the clouds and my feet planted firmly on the ground.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
Well here I sit, at work, bored bored bored.  I've done everything I was supposed to do and a little bit extra.  And it is only 2:45 am.  I'm gonna be here until 8:30 am!!!! UGH!   Anyhoo..  A lot has been goin on the past few weeks.  I've enrolled in school FINALLY! :) YAY.  School starts the 30th.  I am taking Anatomy and Phys, Chemistry, and Psychology.  Not too shabby a work load since I haven't been in school in a few years.   I am really really looking forward to this.  So I went out and registered for school, got everything all settled, I only have two very important things to do before school starts, #1 PAY FOR SCHOOL, and get my reimbursement from work.  and #2 BUY BOOKS.  Buy Books?!?!  My god, those things are outrageous, I sure hope I can find some used ones for sell.   Anyhoo.. Joe is so fantastic.  He is really being supportative about me going back to school.  (but more on him later) So, yes, I am really gonna be a school girl again. GO ME!  (and hopefully I can keep my grades up and still keep a grip on my mind as well *hehe*)  Next thing that has been fairly big, is the fact that Joe and I are moving into a bigger and nicer apartment.  It's a one bedroom with a den.  I'm really excited about it.  Finally, I'll be about to get out of the apartment complex that has been nice, but it was 'cursed' for me from  the day I signed my lease when Joe says to me "yeah Jen and I lived there before" *UGH* so now that we are moving into these new apts, hopefully Joe and I will have soley our OWN memories of our apartment.  Yes my friends, it has been a busy few weeks, and it is bound to get busier as the days go on. So I must leave you now as we have a new admission that needs admitted.  I will write more about Joe when I return again.  But for now T
