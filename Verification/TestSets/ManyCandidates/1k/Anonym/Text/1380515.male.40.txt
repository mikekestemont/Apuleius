be.   - The Recipients -  (disclaimer: The use of the word 'man' or 'men' is generic and is to mean all people regardless of sex)  So who would get the news first, men of science, the army, men of the cloth, politicians? Who would best serve the populace and be able to present the information in such a manner as to not cause mass hysteria in the public? These are difficult questions to answer as it might take input from all these different positions to adequately prepare the public for the annoucement. Safe to say that the news would need to be presented in a factual, serious and perhaps contemplative way. Again, the permutations and ramifications of such an announcement would go well beyond anything ever presented on this planet. Finding intelligent life on another planet would probably be the most important thing ever to happen to the human race and I believe would change our species forever. In the next few entries I'd like to look at different aspects of the UFO phenomenon and delve into some of the facts, figures, places and people who have been the cast of what some skeptics have touted as the theatre of the absurd. I will also throw in a few of my own theories on UFOs, what they may be and a surprising twist on the origins of these aliens.

There are many scientists who will cringe at the thought of calling anything to do with UFOs a science and certainly not the study of them, but in this case my study will not be of the UFOs themselves nor of the evidence or lack of, no my study will be of the meaning, the possiblity and, dare I say it, the need for there to be extra-terrestrial life. The reader might be familiar with a FOX television special from a few years back called "Alien Autopsy", it dealt with a supposed video of an alien cadavre undergoing medical examination and dissection. Well the video ended up being a hoax, but the host of the show, Jonathan Frakes, who is famed as portraying William T Riker on Star Trek, had an interesting line when he mentioned that even if the video wasn't real it begged the question "What if it were real". My blog will do just that and examines the repercussions and ramifications of UFOs and extra-terrestrial l
