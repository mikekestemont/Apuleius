Re-creating the breath of a T. rex for a huge model dinosaur in London’s Natural History Museum posed challenges all of their own.  “We spoke to paleontologists, who gave us a description of the dinosaur. Basically, the bigger the creature, the smellier they were,” said Knight, who is passionate about accuracy. “The dinosaurs would have had open sores from fighting, and rotting meat stuck in the gaps between their teeth. We needed all these features in the eventual odor.”  The T. rex breath turned out to be so revolting that the curators instead opted for a milder swamp smell to evoke the creature’s natural habitat.
