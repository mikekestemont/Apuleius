life...but I doubt he shall find his answer from the shrink he is seeing now a days!He he!  Monday morning boos (or was it blues?)....and today gives me no particular reason to deprieve myself off the pleasures of being grumpy....and keeping a perennially constipated expression on my face...but come to think of it...it actually works...the boss thinks I have been up all night trying to prepare my data....and my friends think I have been kept busy all night by well endowed German babes called Natalie and Sophie...neither of which happen to be true.  Being celibate and constipated really contribute majorly to waking up as was described above...though for today I shall draw the line at just being celibate...as virgin as mother mary...and hopefully going strong on the path for a few years to come!  Back to square 1.......why talk about views not changing unless we are the lead dogs?? Frankly...I dont know..and I dont care.....but hey...lemme admit.....it really feels good to have the view that I currently enjoy...it remains to be answered whether I am a canine or not...lets leave that question to another monday shall we??
Seems paradoxical to say the least.A beautiful sunny morning,nestled in the heart of a beautiful country in Europe,good money,good food,good job and for those of you who value bachelorhood....no wife as well!So,could a guy who has seen a quarter of a century go by (almost!) be any happier? I asked myself...and others as well...usually over a nice kilkenney or  a chilled draught beer at the Irish pub...that explains the title of my first blog......sadly I didnt get much from this...except for an irritated chin that I scratched so that it would seem as if I was musing hard on this philosophical question and maybe lost some weight...its amazing how much they charge u for the "free Irish spirit"!! Ladies and gentlemen,boys and girls...the answer I narrowed down to is procrastination...I had to sieve carefully thru the opinions and advice given to me and trust me it wasnt easy....but when the answer hits u...it really hits u hard...that its not worth doing today what u can put off doing until tommorow.Unfortunately my boss agrees to disagree on that...but then we share our differences in opinion in other matters as well....my opinion being that all bosses are  to put it mildly...a pain in the far end of ur ailmentry canal.So,anyways coming back to where we started...or was this the universal solution to all our woes??I am sure procrastination would have at least avoided the current crisis in Iraq though! Before I loose my way in the maze of my thoughts....lemme just conclude my first blog by advocating that do not do something today that d better be done tommorow..and do not do something that ur boss tells u to do anyways... Nothing explains the chaos and mayhem in this world better than smart ass people taking decisons and acting upon them sooner than was necessary. and in case any1 wonders.....today was that tommorow that I had thought of months ago that Id start blogging.....so much for p
