up a couple times.  Probably more than I can remember.  Wend lifting this morning.  Nothing to do now.  That's my story.  You can read last year this time, I was saying the same thing.  Nothing to do now.
I really don't have anything to do with these and it doesn't seem like any of my friends want them.  (USED UP!)  Please use only one.
Well I'm done with that and now I have almost nothing to do I think.  I'll post some pictures of the before and after.  It should be something fun to look at.  I know not many people read this.  Maybe if there were just more fun things to look at then more people would read and watch.    Before    After  Amazing, right?
I've applied for jobs.  I just might get myself one in a few days.  Then when that day comes, no one will be able to say 'get a job' to me.  I was supposed to have an interview today but that fell through for whatever reasons.  So I'm just sitting here pretty bored, with nothing to do.  After I post this I'm going to go to the bathroom and clean my desk.  One will take 2 minutes.  The other will probably take 10 minutes--if I really do a good job.  That's my plan.  I'm just kind of sitting here wondering what I can do.  There are probably a trillion different things I could do.  Probably more than a trillion.  Theoretically nothing you do is ever the same.  One cell or one atom is different in each.  It's amazing if you take 20 seconds to think about it like I just did.  I like Jazz radio because it keeps my mind stimulated so I don't scratch my eyeballs out while sitting here.  I suggest you listen to it.  I really like some of the upbeat stuff they play lately on SmoothJazz.  I'm going to be an uncle soon, I've discovered.  I shouldn't say discovered because that makes it seem like I didn't know and that someone was hiding it from me.  The truth is that I realize it all now.  Crazy.  Why is it that the internet seems so fast.  Fast, I don't mean in how fast your page loads... but just how everything seems to be to the point.  That could be partially fact or it could be just that I've developed an unchangeable habit of skimming everything I read.  We got a new couch the other day.  It's a very nice couch.  I'm trying to keep the dogs off it.  I don't want dog hair on it.  It is a very nice couch.  I want it to continue to be one of the only places in the house you can sit without getting white and black hair all over your clothing.  (I have a dalmation)  So every time I see Luci on the couch I get mad and yell and get her off.  Then I do my best to get every single hair off.  It's crazy.  Alright I'm actually going to do something now.
