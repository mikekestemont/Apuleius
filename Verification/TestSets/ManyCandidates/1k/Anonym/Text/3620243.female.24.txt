it out.) This really nice guy (Charles) responded to my ad and told me he would be going out of town for some undefined period of time, some time in August. (I don’t think he could have been vaguer about it if he’d been a politician.) Anyway, the stars aligned correctly, Charles got his plane ticket, I packed enough undies for a month, and hopped on a bus to Philly (from D.C.) (I went through the most grueling six hour bus ride, that was supposed to be two hours… but that’s another story.) So Charles left, Kate and I had a wonderful time just being goofy and spending time together, and then Charles came home.  So back to last night: Charles came home to do some work and ended up needing some emergency help cleaning one of his properties. The new tenants had already moved in and the place is filthy. Charles asked me if I would clean it for him. I have not really done anything productive since I’ve been here, so I agreed to help him out. It was nice to have something important to do with my time. I spent eight hours cleaning the kitchen and the bathroom. How could one person spend eight hours cleaning two rooms? That’s what I have been wondering. The bathtub looked as if a herd of hippies had been camping out in it. I wouldn’t have washed a stray dog in that thing. When I was done, the tub was three shades whiter than when I started. (oops.. off on a tangent again.)  The point is that I spent an inordinate amount of time scraping some one else’s filth out of an apartment, and I was exhausted and famished by the time I left. Charles and I decided to go have dinner, but first he invited his friend. His friend came over, and we had a few drinks. Well, actually, I only had one but I had a hard time walking down the stairs after that first drink, so it’s probably best that I didn’t have another… until later.  We ended up going to this little sushi place in down town Philly. I got drunk and spoke drunken Korean to them. Charles commented that it was like Wayne’s world. I’m not sure I can remember why. We managed to kill a giant bottle of sake between Charles’s friend and myself. Charles doesn’t really like sake, so he drank a few beers instead. The sushi was good and the sushi chefs were entertaining.  At some point, we went back to Charles’s house, but I don’t remember that part. I only remember being drunk and silly out on the back porch with Charles and his friend. I think I got into an argument over lesbianism, men and who was more qualified to operate whose equipment… but that’s all I’m going to say about that. At some point Charles changed into a wrap around skirt thing. I don’t remember going to bed, but I guess I did, because that’s where I woke up this m
