WE SAW NAPOLEON DYNAMITE AND WELL IT WAS PERHAPS THE FUNNIEST REAL MOVIE I'VE SEEN BESIDES WEEKEND AT BERNIES 2.  NOTE I SAID REAL MOVIE NOT CRAPPY GEORGE EADS EVEL KNEIVAL MOVIE JESS!  BUT ANYWAYS GO SEE IT ASAP.  TO SEE THE ADDED SCENE THOUGH YOU HAVE TO SIT THROUGH THE CREDITS.  THE THEATRE WE SAW IT AT WAS SORTA CRAPPY AND AS A RESULT THE HEADS WERE CUT OFF ALL THE CHARACTERS.  ALSO THE "DELICIOUS!" SCENE WAS NOT IN THE MOVIES. OH WELL I STILL LAUGHED A LOT AND  IT WAS GREAT ANYWAY AND I ALMOST PISSED MYSELF DURING NAPOLEON'S BIG DANCE NUMBER.  I WON'T GIVE ANYTHING ELSE AWAY.         OH AND IF YOU WERE WONDERING WHAT I WAS LIKE FROM  THE AGES OF 4-8 JUST IMAGINE NAPOLEON AND DEB HAVE A FEMALE BABY AND WELL.........  I REALLY WAS LIKE THAT,  I HAD VERY DEB-LIKE HAIR (YES, THERE WAS THE OCCASIONAL CRIMPING AND SIDEPONYTAIL ALONG WITH PIPPY LONGSTOCKING BRAIDS THAT ACTUALLY STOOD OUT), I THOUGHT I KNEW VARIOUS FORMS OF MARTIAL ARTS (THANK YOU POWER RANGERS), I REALLY LIKED NUNCHUCKS, I HAD A FEW DRESSES AROUND THE AGE OF 5 WITH BIG PUFFY SLEEVES, I DREW TONS OF UNICORNS AND OTHER HORSE-LIKE CREATURES WINGED AND OTHERWISE, I MADE KEYCHAINS AND VARIOUS OTHER TYPES OF CRAFTS AND ATTEMPTED TO SELL THEM ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION, AND WELL I'M GOING TO STOP WITH THOSE DETAILS BECAUSE WELL THOSE WERE MORE THAN ENOUGH AND WELL I DON'T WANT TO LOWER YOUR ALEADY LOW OPINION OF ME.      IT'LL BE A FEW DAYS UNTILL I POST AGAIN BEAUSE MY PARENTS ARE LEAVING FOR A FEW DAYS AND I HAVE THE HOUSE TO MYSELF FOR THE MOST PART AND I'M GOING TO ENJOY THAT.  SO INSTEAD OF COMING HERE AND WRITING TO YOU I WILL BE AT  HOME IN MY UNDERPANTS DRINKING A BUNCH OF COFFE AND PLAYING VIDEO GAMES FOR 2 DAYS.  OH YEAH I THINK MAYBE JESSI IS SPENDING FRIDAY NIGHT SO I GUESS I'LL HAVE ON PANTS THAT NIGHT.      BIZARRO I LOVE YOU, TAGUE
