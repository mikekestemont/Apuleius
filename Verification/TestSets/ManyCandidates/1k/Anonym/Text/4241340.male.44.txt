Bush flew down there to survey the damage and to promise aid and support for those devastated by this disaster. Of course, the media is spinning this as a political move since Florida is a swing state. Sorry W:  Damned if you do and damned if you don't . Those dickheads don't cut you a single break, do they?
Just reading how the Hollywood elite is complaining about their right to free speech is being infringed upon and they are hesitant on speaking their minds for fear of fallout. Bad news for you wieners: If the government causes you grief, then you have a complaint.  But  if your fan base of the general public gives you grief, that is their right. If I choose to boycott an actor (Like Susan Sarandon) because of her political views and her outspoken nature, that is my right as an American. Let us take Linda Ronstadt for example: Escorted from the Aladdin Casino and Resort for dedicating a song to the American Hero: Michael Moore. If I were a member of the audience, I would have walked out as many did. Her departure from the place was not because her right to free speech was violated, it is because she violated the terms of her contract: Sing songs and entertain. It took guts for the president of the casino to do this and this is the reason I have chosen to stay at the Aladdin during my stay there this week.  And Michael Moore: I have one word for him: Cortislim! You fat, frumpy, Un-American bastard! I guess the 911 Commission's report kind of took the fire our of Farenheit 911, you half-truth telling jerk.  And Janeane Garafalo. What qualifies you to insert your two cents? I heard the encounter you had with Larry Elder and your remarks about him being a schill for the Repulican Party and calling him a "House Negro". This remark after calling members of the Repuablican Party racist.  Oh the double standards applied by the liberals of this country.
Well  , it looks like the troops are again rolling toward  Najaf . I have no problem with what they are doing. Just wish they would finish off with this little coward. Seems the only time he calls a truce is when he is getting his ass whipped and needs the bullets to stop flying so he can regroup and refit. What the US needs to do is have some well placed snipers around the clock to wait for the opportunity. But those are just my thoughts on the matter.  Fortunately Brother Ron was in vacation in Thailand when the shit hit the fan and is stuck in Babylon until there is a lull in the fighting.  What else....Oh. Getting ready to head to " Sin City " for a few days of fun in the sun. Not much on gambling. Probably sit by the pool and have some pool drinks. Old army buddy  urlLink   Frank    will be there for work related issues. Great time to get together.  That is all for n
