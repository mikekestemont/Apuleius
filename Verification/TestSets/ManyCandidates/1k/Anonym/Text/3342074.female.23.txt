at Christopher's before we got there.  :(  I'll never see little Davey again.  Though I blame him entirely, since he didn't call me back last time I was there... Hey, I forgot that Dave Nader told Kelly I was a bitch last time I saw him.  Whatever, bitch was distracting Chris Daly so you could do Kelly, slut.  Not Distracting!!  You know what I mean.  Talking.   Anyway .  I missed my grandpa twice--we drove by the house on Saturday and Sunday before we left, but it's ok because he's coming to MO with us to see Pat on the 12th.  Most importantly, tonight my best guy is going to meet my best grrl!  Danielle and I have not seen each other since  before Christmas  and... I can't wait.  Homegirl arrived last night and was not able to make it to the China for drinks (drinks=electric blue kamikaze shots), but it's cool.  It had been more than 6 months since I have seen Dan Yell, people.  Remember how it used to be?  And now it's been 6 months.  Ya'll might want to stand back.  Luckily, we're not taking the same car out tonight so there won't be any rapping, but there'll be plenty of dancing and singing and drinking.  Just like in the olden days.  Awww.  Dani!  Twenty-nine days til The Move, and I'm very excited.  I've started planning my room, and it's going to be fabulous.  Well, I don't think my furniture's going to fit, or my clothes, but durn if it isn't going to look pretty.  I want a recliner.  There's an AWESOME one on  urlLink Bob's Discount Furniture website  that I might just have to put on lay-a-way.  =P  Actually, I doubt a recliner is going to fit in that room but I totally want one.  For my kitten to sit on.  Meow.  Anyway, Tequila Rain tonight if anyone's interested.  They're advertising Amsterjam, but we know the real main event is Daniellapolooza!!

I've moved!  As of Saturday, Erin and I officially became Norwood residents.  Well, Erin already was, but whatever.  Our apartment is adorable and fun and easy to get to, and you should come visit.  The only thing that sucks is that my commute to work is significantly longer (was 10 min, is now about 30), but it's still doable.  I do miss my mom's cooking, but there'll be plenty of that, I'm sure, as work is so close to my parents house, it's not a big deal to go over there for dinner.  The only other big news I have is that I am getting rid of my horrible old phone and switching to Nextel.  Yay!  Is that sad that that's the big news I have?  A little bit, but there's not much else exciting going on.  Six Flags is still on the 14th, and you should still come.  Or E
