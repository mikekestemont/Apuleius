but its pretty well ingrained in me.  Last night Jeff and I went to see a few apartments in the Marina area. Though obviously not my top choice of areas to live in, it would be an ideal area for Jeff to commute from, and convenient enough for me to get to work. Not to mention that the Marina is a beautiful area, with the water front within spitting distance. Despite my bias, I wanted to be fair to Jeff and consider it in our list of areas. The places we saw were mostly not that nice for the price. We did see one fairly decent place, but it is right on Van Ness, and not as nice as other places we have seen elsewhere for the same price or even less. I think we've realized we're better off in another area. Pheww... and I didn't have to seem like a total bitch for just not wanting to live there.
Pardon my complete obnoxiousness, but people have been asking... not that anyone is required to buy me a gift, but if you feel the urge, here are 10 things I'm wishing for:  1) Dirty Dancing Havana Nights on DVD (Don't everyone rush out at once to get this) 2) Le Creuset non-stick spatulas (I lost my other ones in my last move) 3) Dagoba chocolate bars!! 4) Lavender smelling things 5) Pictures of puppies, b/c I can't have one and I'm that annoying person now 6) New agey things like crystals and incense (J/K) 7) Something from Good Vibes ;-) 8) Mani/Pedi gift certificates!! 9) A copy of your favorite book/CD 10) Queen-size, at least 300 thread count Egyptian Cotton sheets - for those of you on a budget!  However your PRESENCE at my birthday celebration on Friday night would be the best gift of all! ... first at Blowfish for dinner, then onto a Mission bar crawl. If you can't make it, gifts will be accepted!
Did the weekend really go so fast? I feel like I had hardly a moment to enjoy it, relax, study for LSAT, etc. Jeff and I managed to spend just about every waking moment either bouncing between open houses, or searching for new listings on Craigslist. And after probably 15 actual viewings, 10 or more drive-bys, and hours (6+) looking at hundreds of listings on craigslist, we have about 3 possibilities. We have only submitted an application for one of them and are keeping the other 2 in mind for back-ups IF we find nothing else, and they're still available. It is such a tiring process looking for a perfect place, and when we finally do, we have the whole headache of moving to deal with. Not to sound too down on the whole thing, I am so excited to live with Jeff in a new place (a new area probably), re-organize and downsize all my stuff, focus on LSAT studying, and then take off on our two week trip to Hawaii! I just hope once we do find this place, we stay there for a
