will do a halleluja dance when she does.&nbsp; I remember saying I couldn't wait until my&nbsp;oldest started walking.&nbsp; People would say that it would be harder then, but I never thought so.&nbsp; They just&nbsp;get that much more fun and you don't have to worry as much about them picking little pieces of crap up&nbsp;off the floor and eating them.&nbsp; Their faces are not nearly so close to the ground then...&nbsp;   Okay enough about&nbsp;that.   The other stuff I have been up to is making ATCs (Artist Trading Cards)&nbsp; and I love it so much I am addicted.&nbsp; See&nbsp; urlLink http://www.cedarseed.com/air/atc.html &nbsp; for a fabulous explanation about these.&nbsp; I wish I had a digital camera so I&nbsp;could take pictures of the ones I finished, but alas not.&nbsp;&nbsp;   So, I guess I should get to those dishes, huh?&nbsp; She says as she sees that&nbsp;she has spent two hours staring at the computer screen and tapping little keys.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
