Challenge. I chose the title  Fear Of Flying  to write about. I am asking if my storyline would suit the title. I want to touch on the metaphorical 'flying', not the actual physical one. Yep.   Ya know what? I gotta get going now. I am so darn tired! See ya next time, eh? TaTa! Night blog!
Hey Hey! What a jolly day! Jolly well! Jolly well!  Yes! Today morning was quite nice. Very nice. I was reading fics and such. HaHa. I forgot the links... Oh yes! There's one.  urlLink The Worst Happiest Day Of His Life   A very very hilarious fic! Tis H/D slash. HaHa! HAHA!   Right. In between reading slashes and watching QianQian and eating dinner, I waited for 2 to come.  I am supposed to meet Hann and his PW group at Woodlands Interchange. I was slightly late and only Hann came. Heh Heh. The other people are still coming over, so me and Hann explored around Causeway Point.   His PW members started arriving. First there was this YaoHua. She gave me the impression that she was quite cold. Then this MiaoMaio came. She waved hi. Oh i meow! Er...I forgot the last one's name. She waved back too.  I brought them to my house to watch the video I helped them record. HaHa. I was busy with my other stuff, naming surfing FictionAlley.   HaHa. Later Hann came in and I helped him with his project, which is finding plastic surgeons to interview. HaHa. Soon we are all sending them emails. Actually, I helped to type their emails, because I did that before.   Yeah. They did project till 6, then they left. Hann has to stay over to do some more project work. We went out to eat dinner.  HaHa! It was refreshing to chat with Hann. Catching up with old times. HaHaHa! Always great to catch up with old buddies! We chatted and chatted. Ha! We even talked about that rat MCP. OOOO! I've found out that he talked about me and CQ toHann, say what, we are always together and not with the class and don't know why/how we can be together for so long. That's none of his freaking business man! Ergh! I am so telling CQ!  Right. When we came back, it was already 7+. HaHa! I bathed first, then continued to chat with Hann and helped him with his project. He left at 8+, and I walked him to the bus-stop because it was raining. We sang "Home" all the way there. HeHe! Glad to have him around! :D  Right! After that,I came back and read Per Solum Lacuna. New chapter out!! Weee! Harry and Draco finally met! Oh my my!! What a cliffhanger! Oh yes! A very badddd cliffie! Now, the main concern is: How are they gonna turn from enemies to lovers? Does it happen over the next chapter or span across agonizingly over few chapters? O.O!! I am so excited to find out!   Why yes! My video for "Centennial Charmed" has been downloaded completely! Gotta go watch it! TaTa! Night b
