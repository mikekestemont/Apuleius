to Saigon. For the next two months, Communist forces repeatedly interdicted these and other key supply routes critical to Saigon's survival in an attempt to strangle the city.  in 1949, President Harry S. Truman signs the National Security Bill, which established the Department of Defense.  1821, Missouri became the 24th state.  it's also the Colorado Primary, George Tenent has been replaced, and it's my birthday.
I'm coming around to Kerry -- shocking, I know. I listened to his speech again, this time on the radio, and it was far less horrifying than watching it. In fact, it was even good. The good thing about this whole dilemma is that I don't really need to like him anyway. It doesn't really matter what I think.   I predict a Kerry victory and Democratic control of the US Senate (and of course the Colorado one too!).    I know it's a few days late (as are my blog entries these days), but check out  urlLink William Greider's  take on the virtues of the Democratic Party.   An excerpt:   The contemporary Democratic Party has also drawn back from the kind of up-close engagement with ordinary people that used to be its hallmark. It is still very much a top-down operation, despite this year's efforts to knock on doors and talk to real people. The mass-market technologies of television-driven campaigns encouraged this distancing but have also weakened the party's ability to listen and learn, to grasp what's bubbling up in people's lives and how Democrats might respond imaginatively. A disconnected politician can still win elections, given the uses of big money, but he may also be blindsided by political upthrusts he didn't see coming. He loses self-confidence. He relies more anxiously on abstracted analyses from polls, policy experts and pricey consultants. Kerry's career and campaign reflect these limitations. Within his party, losing touch is a low-grade disease.
who knew? for those of you that didn't take part in the Iowa Caucus chapter of my life, you can stop reading.  I'm in full agreement with  urlLink David Yepsin 's critic of Governor Vilsack's apology to the Latino Caucus for championing the "English Only" bill in 2002. In the Des Moines Register's article, Yepsin calls this nothing but pure politics, not true conviction. Why after all, would a Governor issue an apology for legislation he supposedly regrets from 2,000 miles away, to no one from that state, and not inform the state's local media? Well, it because he only wants to apologies half way -- knowing the popularity of the bill back at home -- and is only doing so because he wants to win a seat in the Kerry administration.  Sorry to my friends in Vilsack's office (matt and franny), but I'm going with Yepsin on this one.
no entry the last few days. i'm absolutely exhausted from this campaign. trying to get the average american voter engaged in the political process is like banging your head against the wall over and over again. the apathy in the american public is absolutely draining.  am in going to make it 92 more d
