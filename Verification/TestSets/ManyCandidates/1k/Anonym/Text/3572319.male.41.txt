What was the funniest/coolest/most touching memory you have of the 2004 MassSTAR Citizenship Conference?
Hey all! Be prepared this is a long one, but there were a lot of things to be answered and discussed so that is my excuse.   I would love to see MassStar alive and well in five years. I want to see us continuing to touch the lives of high school sophomores. My biggest hope would be to have a solid core group of returning volunteers, especially alumni.  I would love to see us moving with the times and continuing to educate students with classic leadership skills as well. As ten years go by I hope that our numbers would continue to grow, with a strong alumni support system.  I would hope to see new and improved platforms and discussion panels.  My hopes for 15 years would be the same, maybe by this time we would be starting to expand into other states.  I am not sure 15 years is along way down the road. MassStar will always be in Massachusetts but maybe like I said before we will start expanding to other states.  If we do everything right (like we normally do) everyone will know about us.   I believe with the intelligence, experience and passion of our volunteers that our curriculum, workshops, and activities can only become the best out there.  We are a young educated passionate group of leaders working to pass along our knowledge. Our curriculum, workshops, and activities will always be deeply embedded with classic leadership qualities, however we will always progress with the times and the students that we are trying to reach.  I am not sure how many students will be involved, but I would hope that as word travels among schools that more and more schools would wish to participate.  Parental involvement is something that I have always wanted to see more of, however I am not sure how to get that to happen or in what capacity to use the parents.  I do feel that if the parents are involved it will continue the growth process after the students leave the conference.  Brand new things will always occur with so many creative minds working together.  This is one of those things that we are just going to have to wait and see what the future and our creativity brings us.   I know that this is rather longwinded and the answers are not completely definite, however we are involved in something that has so many variable all we can do is continue to work and do what we love, passing leadership on to the future.  Smile everyone.
Question of the week:  Where do you want to see MassSTAR in 5 years? 10? 15?    Some things to consider...  Where will we be?    Who will know about us?    How good will our curriculum and workshops and activities be?   How many students will attend our conferences?  How many parents will be involved, and how?  What brand new things will we be d
