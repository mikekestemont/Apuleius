house and have it done in September.  I wish I had a picture on-line to show everyone.  Anyway, when we got back to our house on Sunday, we had 7 (!!) contracts on it by the time we got back.  How crazy is that?  Needless to say, we're getting more than the list price for it, which is great.  That same night, I found out my mom was having surgery on Monday.  You know how I said she never tells anyone?  Well, I think she purposely called us over the weekend when she knew we wouldn't be home to let us know she was having surgery.  And I'm pretty sure the only reason she called is because my dad made her.  I went to stay with my mom and dad in Maryland for a few days to help out around the house where I could.  I went back this weekend for Mother's Day and she's doing really well.  So now I'm looking for apartments for Dale and I to live in after we sell the townhome, but before we move into the house.  We also have to figure out storage and all kinds of fun stuff like that.  I'm hoping to have a professional move everything so we don't have to worry about it, but we'll just have to figure it out.
It's been over two months!   I know it's been a long time since I've written in here, but I hadn't realized it's been over two months since I last posted anything.

Dale's got his home-office set-up going on  for him . I keep reminding him that I specifically asked for some desk space of my own that was out of his way and where I could work without bothering him. Somehow, we ended up with a super huge desk and plenty of space for one (Dale) and zippo, zero, nothin' for the other (me). We'll definitely have to remedy that.  The doctor said I need to lose weight. I knew I was putting on a couple of pounds I didn't want, but it seems so bad when a doctor tells you you need to drop them. So Dale and I went out jogging this morning. I really have no stamina, but we went for 30 minutes, so I have to be proud of myself. There's this  urlLink Atlanta Bread Company  place around the corner from our apartment complex. I wanted to run there and grab breakfast to walk back with, but Dale, who doesn't eat breakfast, vetoed that pretty quickly. I'm still proud of the fact that I dragged my butt out of bed and got running. That in itself is an a
