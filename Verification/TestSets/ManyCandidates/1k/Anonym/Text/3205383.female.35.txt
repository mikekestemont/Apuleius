too great a respect for people to call anyone that name. I know that sometimes a person has to be described by the color of their skin, but its only a part of the descriptors that I ask.  It made me angry and sad at the same time.  I hope they do move back to Montana.  I had ofcrs on the way to a call with a gun. My questions were completely appropriate and respectful.  I'm going to bed
Has a very relaxing day the last 2 days of my weekend.  Working an extra day had made me more tired than I expected. On Tuesday I saw the detective that was working on my background check.  He said you're not supposed to be here... I said I'm working over time. :) We had a nice conversation for about 15 minutes and I continue to feel that they are real people.  They do their job because its part of who they are but they haven't lost their humanity.    Here's another little bit from soulcraft.  I'm not sure yet why this spoke to me as it did.  I decided if I wrote about it I might understand better.

He listened attentively.  Then I asked him if there was anything he wanted to say before I left.  Immediately, and for the first time since I began to talk, he moved. He hopped about a foot to his left beneath the roof of a small boulder in a pika sized cavelike room.  He sat comfortably in that cozy spot as if he had just arrived home from a long journey.  He looked up at me with his big black eyes and smiled.  Then he hopped another foot beneath a tiny spruce and chewed on some seeds he found there.  He looked at me again.  Okay I replied, as tears escaped by eyes, thank you pika. You be well too.  God bless you and yours.  I found his message to be as eloquent and stirring as the lines from a favorite poem by Derek Walcott:  The time will come when, with elation, you will greet yourself arriving  at your own door, in your own mirror and each will smile at the others welcome  and say, sit here.
