large part to play in that the liberal use of AC’s (god bless the soul of the man who invented it) notwithstanding.  One thing I have to mention  though is that internal colony roads in Delhi are a shade or two better than the average main road in Bangalore and zipping around on Delhi roads just makes you realize how pathetic infrastructure in this little village actually is. Yes make no mistake Bangalore is little more than a village. A very wet puddle of a village these days.  I did watch a couple of movies while in Delhi both of them were (surprisingly) pretty decent. ‘Lakshya’ makes it a double directorial success for Farhan Akhtar who has won himself at least one faithful audience for his next venture whatever that might be. Though not accomplished with the same masterful ease as ‘Dil Chahta Hai’  ‘Lakshya’ does have its moments and manages to touch a cord or two while managing to tread the fine line between stirring patriotism and jingoism.  Could have done without the silly romance angle though but the average crowd has to be catered to I suppose. Which of course brings me to Miss. Zinta. Your dimples not withstanding ma’am what were you thinking???  The other flick I watched in those oh-so-comfy seats at ‘wave’ was Troy. Peterson does a competent enough job though he did take the story a couple of times round the proverbial block. Brad Pitt (surprisingly) did not look ludicrous as Achilles. In fact I think he carried the weight rather well. The real surprise of the movie though was a large tub of popcorn. You see I’m a big guy (read fat). And when a portion of popcorn is large enough and buttered enough to make me pause, just for a bit, before delivering my coup-de-grace it is truly something to be admired. Be in no doubt the outcome of the battle between the tub and me was as decided as Achilles Vs Hector but that popcorn earned my respect. (or maybe I’m getting old.)  One thing I discovered in Delhi was that hukka smoking is not for me. I’ve tried them all now from cigarettes to bidi’s through cigars onto hukka’s and every time I smoke it literally tears my throat to shreds the next morning. So I’m officially off all forms of smoking for the rest of my life. (apart from the luxoriously fruity delights of Bangalore busses coupled with the heady aroma of bangalore’s auto’s )  Tequila is not too my liking either though I must admit I did not have enough of it to test the old adage (1 tequile, 2 tequile, 3 tequila…… Floor).  Food in Delhi remains unconquered unlike the city itself, which has changed hands throughout history rather frequently.   So here I am back in this soaked, pothole infested village slogging it out with traffic once more at what is supposedly a flyover construction but looks like a battle zone (its more like a massacare). I am seriously thinking of calling for UN aid and international a
