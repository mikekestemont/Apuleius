condition as being in a way, a terminal illness. It is the thing that will kill me in the end. (**make that cellos, more mournful**) Unless you've been there, you don't get it. And even some people who have still don't get it. Suicide (dum dum daaaaaaa!!) is not caused by one shitty event. You can walk around feeling like that all the time, like "why the hell do I bother?!?", doing all the hard work that amounts to nothing but more hard work, and you just carry on. There are good bits, and people who's feelings you care about. It can make friends and relatives who are left behind feel abandoned and rejected, like they failed you somehow, failed to fix the world for you. Not being conceited about how important I am in their lives, I just know how I'd feel if one of them took the "big step".  All that the one shitty event does is just make the part of you that really couldn't care less about other people, and what their reaction might be, turn around and go,   "What now!? MORE crap?! Crappier crap!? Hey, you won't even be here for all that "boohoo" rubbish, look out for number 1 for a change, look after your own needs! We don't have to stand for this, it's getting us nowhere, carpe deum, sooner's better than later, old age looks like it sucks ass! They'll respect your decision, they know it's crap too. If they really love you, they'll know this is he only way you can stop feeling this bad! There's only more of the same on the way you know"

I'm stuck in this shitty house with 2 people I can't stand, with no money to get away from them. Neither short term by going out and letting my hair down, nor long term by getting out of this house. I'm paying off a huge loan for a dumdass holiday for the next 7 years. A holiday I didn't even make the most of because I believed the word of a liar, and held back, not wishing to ruin something that it turns out didn't even exist.  I have no space, no privacy and no peace and quiet.  The one person that I could always turn to when I felt this low has betrayed my trust so much that I couldn't turn to them even if I could stand them right now.  All I have is my one shitty room, and a bunch of junk in it. I can't even guarentee that I have that. I can't tell if my privacy is invaded to the extent that my room isn't even truely mine anymore.  He was completely right, all the things I like are useless crap. I am not a person people want around and I am s
