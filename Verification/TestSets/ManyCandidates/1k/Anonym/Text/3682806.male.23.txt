events as we speak? We go through these same things all day everyday. Why is it interesting to watch jessica and nick order chinese food and decide what movie to watch?     I think in a year from now we will have reality shows about people watching realty shows. Then VH1 can do a show where a they "re-cap" what happened during the show and all these stupid comedians can sit and do the commentary and make fun of the whole thing and talk about what a stupid show it was and how dumb the people were who were in it, and how what they did and how they dressed is so "5 minutes ago" now.      How can VH1 sit and make fun of all these shows and videos that they used to play and advertise not too long ago? Man... they seriously have the best formula: Make a product, convince everyone that it is cool, when the heat dies down make a show about how stupid and gay it was to begin with.

For the love of God, please don't watch mtv or vh1 !!!!!

Sometimes though, I feel like life is composed of a trillion or more beautiful moments and it's almost too much to take in. Think about it. A slightly overcast day, sitting with a really good friend, you're both on your fourth beer, and in the middle of a conversation about your plans for a future that leaves you both with this feeling that life is laid out ahead of you. Whenever the sentence crosses your concience, out loud or in your own mind, " It doesn't get much better than this " you have to give thanks to whatever power put you here in this life. Be it fate, God, or some collection of peaganistic fancies. Moments like this make me think that all of life is like this and the only reason it doesn't seem so is because sometimes we forget and refuse to accept it.         Does the "good" in life outweigh the "bad" or the other way a
