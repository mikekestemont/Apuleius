weird (just a warning, if you rent this MAKE SURE you get the DVD cuz the ending is really crappy... the alternate ending is so much better) but yeah, i wouldn't exactly reccomend it... it had a pretty confusing plot and everything. prolly best a second time when u can actually understand what's going on. i think the creepiest part was the monsters tho. but yeah. i dont think there's much more to say about the days since my last post. haha i think this is the longest post yet. itd be a lot longer if i was able to go into detail about last night, but its almost best i dont... just in case the wrong person happens to come and see this blog... yeah anyways CRAP its almost 10... bleh well i should prolly end this since i have nothing left to say but I LOVE ERIC MORE THAN ANYTHING!!!!!  :: I LOVE ERIC!!!! :: :: woo woo woo go power rangers ::
,.:'`':., 8/13/04 ,.:'`':., ยบ*~ Mood: nothing actually ~*ยบ  GOD i haven't written in a long time! i actually forgot about this site for a while... ive been so stressed... yeah. anyways, i got LOTSA stuff to say... if i can remember.... well the biggest thing was that eric and i broke up... yeah it sucks but hey ill move on... eventually... it sux cuz its SO hard to find a guy my parents actually like, and eric was the first one they DID like... but i got my sights set (maybe) on one guy my parents do like... it might happen, dunno tho. pretty sure he's interested in me, not sure. haha i jus realized today is friday the 13. nothing bad happened tho. yeah we went to anza (my parents have a house in the desert) with my bff jessie. we went up for a meteor shower but it was really cloudy so we didn't see a whole lot of that. but this morning i woke up at 7 to a thunder storm and watched that till at least 4. that was awesome. the most ADORABLE doggie came over from another property... looked a lot like a dingo, but she was so sweet... she kept dragging her butt on the ground and leaving little lines from her butt everywhere. it was so cute. so yeah, not a whole lot has happened... well there's a lot of details about eric but im not gonna go into that cuz last time i went into detail about my emotions on this he got really mad at me.... so yeah it only lasted about 2 1/2 months. well yesterday it would have been 12 weeks, which is 3 months so it really sucks. 3 months to the day would have been in exactly a week. aaaaanyways enough of that subject. since i can't think of anything else that has happened, im gonna end this post. sorry i haven't written in a while!!! im gonna try to write more.   :: woo woo go power rangers!!!! :: :: I LOVE.... NOBODY!!!!! :
