my audience :)
Hello to no one who is reading my blog!&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm finally, after a lot of soul-searching and several false starts, restarting my blog.&nbsp;   I have done some research on what people do on their blogs.&nbsp; I have seen people who use a blog to comment on news with their political views, to mock, to inform others about their embarrassing illnesses, to make cryptic comments, to make themselves look better than other people with blogs, to start revolutions of words, to get previously unpopular ideas into the mainstream, to be pretentious, to give us too much information, to comment on other blogs, to document every time they use the bathroom, or to make inane comments.&nbsp; You'll probably get a piece of almost every type on this website.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can guess which ones I will avoid :).   But first, why is this the purple pen.org?&nbsp; Primarily, because my life is not-for-profit :).&nbsp; However, it isn't because purple has surfaced as my favorite color.&nbsp; Actually, a  urlLink study  conducted by the Pilot corporation and published in an  urlLink article  on finding Irish jobs.&nbsp; Read the study - its silly, but interesting :).&nbsp; By the way, I have about 40 pens at my desk, many purple.
I had dreams about catalogues for black preachers last night.  Catalogues that apparently listed our SAT classes without any hint of location.   And then my backup 6:40 alarm went off and I cant go back to sleep.  So I'm posting to tire myself out.  I really do throw myself into my job.  How many other people would be reading a message board about the new SAT before 7am?  or checking their work emails before then, either.   My old boss STILL hasn't announced that i've switched jobs, even though he promised to do it multiple days ago.
i say touchdown because it will be short :).  i missed  urlLink stina  tonight because I ended up coming home and cooking dinner right away, so by the time i called her back, she was ignoring her phone. but i made my own pasta sauce, which was exciting, and bread and pasta-from-a-box.  when i grow up, ill have my own pasta maker.  the daily show's interview tonight was wonderful - no, thats not why you had the rapid response team there...BAM!...jon stewart giving a smackdown.  check it out, you westcoast people, dont miss it :).  finally, work wasn't frustrating today, despite making 60 phone calls :).  off to bed, eric must catch the 7:20 train tomorrow, which means im driving him in 7 hours :).
If we were curious, I'm not going back to college until I marry rich. (As in money, not the kaplan trainer, though the kaplan trainer graduating harvard med with the MD and the MBA might be the same thing, but ill stick to my lawyer and leave megan to rich) If you want details let me know, but im pissy.  My magic extendonails are off...to leave my real extendo nails!!  if i hear one more thing about a bounce, ill kill someone.  And  urlLink Menckles  found my blog :
