to wherever it's sunny, anywhere in the world!  Like maybe they wake up one day in Canada and think ' oooh it's getting a bit parky innit?  Let's us all be off to Africa where it's nice and warm'   And off they go.  So when I grow up, I want to be a goose.
urlLink    Errrr...  I have no idea how this injury was sustained, only that it happened on Friday between the hours of 9pm and 5am.  I have no memory of what happened between these times (which may be a good thing?) but anyone kind enough to set me straight will win a prize - ta! xxx&nbsp; urlLink
Blinkety flip - Is it Friday again already???  Last Friday was rather stupendous as I spent the evening with my lovely bendy friend T - she's a yoga teacher don'tcha know! Anyhoo we got rather squiffy round at hers and then she sent me off into the garden to harvest lavender for her to sell at a flower show market thingy she was doing the following day. It was great.  I had a whale of a time happily pruning her sweet smelling bush in the moonlight. (oooh er!)  Then S came over with promises of doing something exciting with a trout, but by the time he arrived none of us were capable of any kind of trout handling so we had to dial out for food. Easy enough you might think. Well, yes, under normal circumstances there would be no problem. However, that night I had noticed that T had said the word 'Chicken Kebab' a lot!. I think I was noticing it even more through my fuzzy haze of squiffeyness because usually T is very veggie. Anyhoo, that night T was positive she wanted said 'Chicken Kebab.' And some bright spark decided that the responsibility of food ordering would be left to me. Not a very good plan under the circumstances because as I dialed the number, I was suddenly hit by the hilarity of the word 'Chicken Kebab' and I realised that there was NO way I was going to be able to speak to a person in the straight outside world AND say the funniest words I had ever heard, without turning into a guffawing baboon. But it was too late! The nice outside world lady had answered and was asking me things! And no matter how hard my rational and by this point very hungry self told me to 'hold it together hippy' my anarchic wasted side just wouldn't listen! So poor outside world lady just got me saying 'Yes' * giggle*  'Can I please hahahahve a Chik heheheh - OH BOLLOCKS!' * hang up fall to the ground laughing*  Finally T came to the rescue and did manage to place the order with only a few muted giggles (whilst me and S snorted with hilarity in the background) and we were saved from starvation.  Full of food and wine and things we rounded off the evening with a good old sing song and games of charades. Bloody H
