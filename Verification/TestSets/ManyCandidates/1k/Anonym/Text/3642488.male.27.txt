FREAKS!
I have never used one of these "BLOGS" to post what goes on in my otherwise screwed up brain, but I figured what the hell, I ain't got anything to lose except my self dignity, my life...well just my dignity otherwise, but its my world otherwise so I figured why not...You know I find it rather interesting how I have come this this point in my life where I am seeking more but wanting less.  Allow me to clarify, at the ripe old age of 27, I am seeking what only a handful can actually grasp...PURPOSE (Please keep the "Matrix" comments to a minumum) Seriously now, I wonder what I am actually here for?  I mean what PURPOSE do I serve on this planet, in this life?  I tend to wonder about too many happenings and mishappenings lately, but I feel I need a PURPOSE, I need a reason to be here.    See if you can follow me, when we are children, we don't care about anything, just our toys and our food.  When we hit our preteens and teens all we care about is sex, chilling with our friends & partying.  When we hit young adulthood & adulthood, well we still care about sex and partying, but now there are bills and (for some) children, family.  For me, since I could remember, all I really cared about was PURPOSE.  I remember asking my mother when I was 10 yrs old, why I was here?  Her response was that I am acting silly and I should go out and play with my friends (I have since come to the realization that this was her way of getting rid of me so she can have some "alone" time with her man)  I would ask these questions to family, friends, teachers and whoever else would take the time to listen to me ramble.  I was told once by my uncle that I have an old philosopher's soul trapped in me and I am trying to figure out why (damn drunk), my teachers would just brush me off and say to write down what I thought was my purpose in life (damn school system) & my friends could really give two fucks about my questions (damn losers).    But still I seek the answer to my many questions...What is the purpose of me being here?  Why am I here?  What kind of difference can I make to this world?  I try and self meditate and seek the answers within, but I only end up with more questions than answers.  Interesting enough I have answered some of my many questions, and they have produced some great conversation pieces albeit with myself but nevertheless great!  I don't know, maybe I am crazy, maybe I am a genius...I just don't know.  But that is the greatness about life and it's ever changing ways...yes we have questions and yes we can debate the answers until sunrise, but maybe that's what gives us purpose.  Maybe my PURPOSE...OUR PURPOSE is to find the answers to life's many questions...I just don't k
