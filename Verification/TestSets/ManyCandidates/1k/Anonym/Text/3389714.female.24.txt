a movie that on the scale from 1 to 10 would fall at a 7… wasn’t all that scary however after the movie my friend and I sat in my yard swinging on the family swing and started analyzing the film.. soon after …we headed to bed ..and I being nocturnal just lied there hoping that sleep will take over my lifeless body… while I lie in bed it is customary and a ritual that my brain runs through enormous amounts of useless information that is not even relevant to me.. so basically I’m always thinking ..about stuff that I can’t even remember the next day.. while I lied in bed around 2:20am this morning with my eyes shut tightly knowing that I’m still awake.. I felt it… a large object behind me… I knew exactly what it was …the scary beast from the movie dressed in a red cloak… then I felt him grab my shoulder… I stopped breathing and waited for the hand to release my shoulder… then I screamed as loud as I could all with my eyes closed… when I opened them.. I saw my friend who was lying to my left get up and attack me with her sharp claws.. and bloody fangs….. at that point I shoved my head in a pillow and waited for all of it to stop.. I guess in the back of my head I knew it was a nightmare and I just had to let it pass… about 5 min after I grabbed my cell phone and left the room.. I called up a friend and told him I just had a freaking nightmare and I had to get my mind off of it.. so we talked about silly things and I soon returned back to my room..now I was deathly afraid of sleeping in the same bed with my friend who has earlier attacked me in my nightmare..i grabbed a blanket off my bed and slept opposite the footboard on the floor…every time she would twist and turn in her sleep I would turn restless.. this lasted for about an hour and a ½..soo I finally realized why was I so scared of my friend ..big deal it was a freaking nightmare get over it.. I got back into bed and asked her if she was awake ..she stated “yah”..and then I proceded to question her if she heard me scream.. she was like “yah but I thought I might have kicked u” .. little did she know I was being attacked by her and the beast from the movie.. I told her about my nightmare and we laughed it off… but I think I seriously need to stop watching horror movies… I don’t think my psyche can handle and process them in a logical manner.. yes they are fun to watch but the nightmare aren’t.. so from now on .. I refuse to watch horror movies… and hopefully it will put an end to vicious nightmares…   Question of the Day…  What is it like when u have n
