Design to my Legislative Process class -- trying to hold their attention for a full three-and-a-half hours.  Good luck to me.

This is my first blog.  I'm trying it out because I largely don't understand the phenomenon of blogging.  Where have all the journals gone?      I figure it provides some kind of release for a good number of people, and since I stay fairly stressed out it might be beneficial.  We'll see.
That's the theme of my life these days... gettin' big.  i feel like i'm getting big.  my dog is getting huge.  i can barely lift her any more.  the semester is shaping up to be pretty big.  my headache at the moment is really big....
