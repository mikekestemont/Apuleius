about not having money. No worries, I can't have babies...LOL just makes me sad to see a baby and know my baby days are over.  Gotta go make myself useful now.
Tonight I am wondering what is wrong with people. To me some things just don't bloody matter. My friend came to me tonight feeling sad and upset and rightfully so. She is a widowed mom of one. She was 29 when her husband passed away. These things matter. What shocks me is people who complain about the littlest things and can't see beyond their own noses. It is lucky for these people that one cannot just reach into the monitor and choke the living shit out of them like Homer would do to Bart.  I have great friends though. They love me and support me. They encourage me. Without them life would be different. There was a time when I was just an angry person and I thought I had nothing positive about me. My friends have taken the time to show me what good things I can do. I love them all for that.  The internet is my way of escaping from the Patch. I live in a great town really but it seems boring here. Yet there is so much to do. Just an hour ago I could hear the fireworks going off just as they do every Wednesday and Saturday throughout the summer. It is a quiet town really and nothing dangerous ever happens. We have some crazy drivers but what town doesn't.  It is almost bed time and time to settle in for the night. My dd Susan has to go to school tomorrow, she has assured me that she will wake up LOL.

My passion is car seat safety. I am just that way. I drive some people crazy with my endless stats and pushing for laws. Finally got the law to 8 years and 80 lbs starting next month. OH yes and who can forget my hot head. I tend to enjoy that though so we won't go there LOL. More about me I am a mom, I am good at that job although I wonder if I am being tested at times and I fail the test. I have two girls they are the loves of my life. My oldest is 10 and the younger one is 4. I have two cats, a tabby and a tuxedo. Both are fixed but sometimes I think they are broken LOL cuz they do gross things.  I drive a school bus but now I have my air brake endorsement so I am happy that I can drive anything but a tractor trailer now. My goal is to drive c
