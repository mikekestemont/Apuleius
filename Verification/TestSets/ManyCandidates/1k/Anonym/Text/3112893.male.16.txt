never been good at threatening people, so, until recently, whenever it came time for a threat, I would just use someone else's threat. Well "Expect a beating from a certain girl with short hair and glasses" isn't a great threat it turns out. I thought it was good when Megan used, I don' know why it worked then and not now.
I just got back from a birthday dance. It was fun, I danced with a total of three girls, I danced about six times, for a grand total of two moves (swing basic, waltz basic). After quite a while came the time for the cake, they turned down the lights, Pat asked, "Why are they turning the lights down?" I was tempted to say, "So the ugly girls have a chance to dance," but I figured I probably shouldn't. They weren't any ugly girls there anyway; it's bad enough to call an ugly girl ugly, but to call a pretty girl ugly...  While I was standing outside, George, the brother of Margie (the birthday girl) came outside and said, "I hate it when that happens!" I said, "What?" He said, "I got a burrito in my pants." I looked at his knees and there was a lump and a wet spot from the sour cream and salsa. What's funny is that he said it as if it's happened before.  At the house they had some pictures of Bush dressed up as a fighter pilot with some real pilots, and the first thing Charlie notices is that they're all wearing cups. I think wearing cups is a perfectly reasonable thing-- what, with all the triple a's and the missiles flying at you all the time, you need some protection*. You don't want a SAM, or God forbid, a SCUD (just in case you accidentally hit one on the way) in that particular part. Plus, according to movies, the joystick is right in that special spot; if you slam on the brakes really quickly, that would hurt.   *"Ma'am, you husband was shot down, this is all we recovered of him."
If someone with multiple personalities gets caught just before trying to commit suicide, he should be charged with homicide, rather than suicide.
Why did they pick arrows to go with bows? If you put a row of weapons out consisting of a sword, an arrow, and a flail, we all know the person will go for the sword or flail. Most likely the sword. Why? Because it does more damage. So why not fire swords out of bows?
Here's something that will get you thinking (as if anything doesn't get something moving in one's brain): Are you being sarcastic, or sarcastically being?
OK this is what I think: Blondes are the bombshells, dark-haired girls are the bombs.
Next time I hear someone play an instrument before me, when they've finished I'm going to say, "You're really good." Then later, if they ever bring it up again, maybe say to their friends, "[Insert my name here] thinks I'm good at the piano," I'll just say, "It was a m
