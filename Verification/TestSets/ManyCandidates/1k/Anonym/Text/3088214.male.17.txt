followed by a global ice age is pretty unrealistic.  But as long as it reminds people of global warming and the problems that it could eventually create, then I'm all for it!But, anyways, not enough of "the governments" money goes into research for global warming and, while the process is irreversible, it would be worthwhile to research how we could slow down the process that we're now heavily involved in.  However, although the issue seems like it would be pretty un-controversial, there are many scientists who actually believe that global warming is not something that humans cause, that it is simply part of the world turning and getting older.    In the last century on the earth's surface (keep in mind that this is on the ground, not in the actual atmosphere), there have been increases of at three degrees Fahrenheit, which may not sound like much, but it's caused the sea level to rise from six inches to about three feet.  Of course the increase in sea level is caused by ice sheets melting from the increase in temperature.  It's all relevant!!!  And, if these changes had taken place over the last thousand years, it really wouldn't be that big of a deal.  Wow, the earth changes....what a concept!  But the fact that over only 100 years so many changes have taken place...well, it's worth getting into.  You guys, please respond to this one.  It's important, and we need to move on from the gay marriage and abortion topics.  I think that everyone has said what needs to be said, and it's time for something else.  Later!  Bethany
this place has been inactive for some time... ms. Clark was the first post in a month... wow... not much goin' on. so, how's everybody's summer going? anyone want to share their AP grade.. i got a highly discraceful grade...a 2... =( and i thought i did exceptionally well on the MC and alright on the essays....
Hey students...I am settling in and have already started working.  Next week is my third week at Shorecrest.  I hope everyone is having a relaxing summer but I hope you are still all thinking and learning...there is no evidence of this by looking at our blog...did anyone see Farenheit 9-11...?  My new email address is stephanie.clark@shorelineschools.org.  I would love to hear how you did on the AP test.  Remember it is a difficult test and set up so  only 50% of the students paww with a three or better.  In addition only 8% GET A 5.  Also remember only the top scholars in the nation choose to take these tests...so pat yourself on the back for your effort and the amount you learned despite your score or regroup for a better effort next year.   For those of you who did well  and I am sure some of you did congratulations.  Rob-how is the ASB retreat going?  Enjoy the rest of your summer and I hope to hear from some of you.
Summer has been great,  i got a 3 on my AP test.  Hope everyone is doing well.  ~
