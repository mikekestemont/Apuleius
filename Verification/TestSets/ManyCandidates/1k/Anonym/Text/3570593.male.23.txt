is nearing six and my prospects are looking grim for the rest of the evening.    Tomorrow is my temp company appointment.  I am not excited, I'm sick of forms, surveys, applications, writing my social security number and most of all I am sick of being cheerful for strangers.  I do it well though. I appear very quiet and unassuming outwardly, polite.  Inside I am cursing the whole goddamned state of affairs.   I miss my friends as well.  I am only a phone call away, but it isn't the same.  I have been a friendless wonder down here for nearly four weeks and it is getting to me.  I am beginning to crack.  Marital relations offer only so much, but you experience the boundaries of where you're allowed to go, allowed to say without causing trouble.  I want to cause trouble though.    My other problem is with the narcoleptic that occupies the sofa all day, snoring to inane daytime television.  Court shows, COPS reruns, MTV, it all makes me wretch.  I could go to my bedroom, but I don't like being cooped up in one room all day, remember I am still jobless.  Perhaps once I get that elusive job, I will be more than happy to stay in my room.  She's not all bad, she bought furniture for the back porch and she hasn't seemed to notice or does not care that I drank two of the four bottles of wine that she bought the other day.    All in all though, my life is without major problems.  My complaints are minor, there is not much that I need, no life threatening issues.  I should be happy.  Well.... maybe later.
So I am going crazy, again.  For time 6,093, I am finding myself in the position of having to make that fight or flight decision, this time the stakes are a bit high.    I also feel like I have no creative outlet.  I don't think I've had an effective creative outlet for years and none in which I haven't taken myself much too seriously.  I'm not sure when I made the change from naive, cause of the week, pretentious college student to pretentious, world weary, pompous asshole.  Perhaps it was about the time I quit college, moved to an unfamiliar city and stopped doing everything.  That was a long process, but I think it is all coming together well.  So now I am unemployed, I am kept, but unemployed, this bothers me to no end. I try, but somehow, it never really gets too far.  I have some prospects, but nothing seems to be working out.  I can't get past this corporate culture that has permeated every human resources office in the country. "What are your goals", "Where do you see yourself in the (insert company name) corporate tree". Maybe this would not annoy me so much if I wasn't applying for jobs that pay in the area of $7.00 an hour.    But I'm not all complaints, I have grumbles, hang-ups, problems, too.    Oh well, many months to write on these subjects.  G
