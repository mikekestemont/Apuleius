she lied about not smoking.   busted.  ...... what else?  he is still being a fucking lame-o regarding it all. you know. he and i. but he can be so pervy....  i dont like heavy doses of the perv. its not ok. men, i tell ya.  seems weekends travel a lot faster now that i am old... its getting bad.  i wonder if the boys back home are graduating from college here soon... some of them have to be, right?   i am determained to marry a man with sleeves. how hot..
so when someone really cares about you, dont make that impossible, or they will stop caring.  ...however i havent yet. but im close. so. where are you.
sorry.  ive been around.  saw napolean dynamite. loved it.  thanks guys.  so yeah, when things get better, more interesting, i will be back. until then, still taking a cyber rest. this is seemingly a waste of my time.
654694677 I wonder sometimes what it is that she thinks about me. She never just says she misses me. She only says it after I do. So I think I just wont say it until she does from now on. I wonder how I am in her life. I have such a hard time trying to figure out her moods. Sometimes she seems really really into me and interested and others she just seems so ambivalent. I go back and forth in my head about this all the time and I feel like it is starting to take over. I just start to feel so lost and I cant think. I don't know what she is going to tell me this weekend. I don't know how I will react to it all. I am so scared right now to know and it is eating me up inside. I should have said it. I think she could feel it that day on the curb. But I didn't know how she would react. I didn't know if she would say it back or even if she feels that way about me. I just couldn't imagine her driving away after that. I'm starting to freak out again. This is hard.
i think i have decided to get stars tattooed on my chest. below my collarbones. h-o-t.  so life has been pretty ok. work is awful, but i work hard and i am not so sure why.  i did get my raise though, 10%.  still.  so yeah, how ARE you?  my mamason and little brother are flying out next month. california here they come. i dont think my bro will dig it. its not his thing, i am sure.  so a member of the wnba told me she was going to crack my skull. because i wouldnt give her her money back for her 8ball record. oh, the ghetto bitches of the sparks. please.  pathetic, that people are this way.  im missing on a lot of people back home.   .
