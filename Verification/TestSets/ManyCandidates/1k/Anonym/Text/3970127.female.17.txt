I could feel the blood rush to my toes!!! But the few of the lake was beautiful. Today we're biking to Signy centre to go shopping!  All summer we've been going to 'Differenciels', this is the place to be in Nyon. It's really funky, they have great paninis and salads. yum yum ! So I recommend it :-) ( urlLink http://www.differenciels.ch/ )
I LOVE this time of year. Another gorgeous day - I will set the scene: I am surrounded by fields & forest, blue sky, a glimpse glistening lake and mountains on both sides.      but.. there's Paleo....fete de Geneve...there are even jazz bands playing in Nyon! Lainey is back! yay!!! It had been five weeks since I had seen her - with trips to N. Ireland, Tanzania, Nottingham, South Africa in between, so lots of catching up to do. And I leave on Wednesday again, so it will be a short catch up. We going to have our boggle rematch, bike to the lake, swim, then go on all the upside down rides in geneva. fun fun fun :-) It is scary thinking how we first met when we were five years old...:O Now we're signing up for our driving first aid courses & theory courses &amp; applying to university!! how time flies.   right : walk dog & work. (although, don't think I'll get much work done:) )
I read thru this today (my utmost for His highest devo), and it really struck me:  "It is not true to say that God wants to teach us something in our trials: through every cloud He brings, He wants us to unlearn something. "  and  "It is by those very clouds that the Spirit of God is teaching us how to walk by faith. If there were no clouds, we should have no faith. "  and "The clouds are a sign that He is there. What a revelation it is to know that sorrow and bereavement and suffering are the clouds that come along with God! God cannot come near without clouds, He does not come in clear shining. "  This is a devos from a few days ago, but it was nabbing away at my subconscience (sp?). I've been thinking a lot about it because a friend was going through a rough time, basically asking, "Where is God? Why isn't He near?" and another friend has had a really rough year, not being on fire or motivated, and just struggling. So it really stood out about unlearning, and also how God does not come in clear shining. Just thinking about obediance &amp; faith. :-) This is what I was thinking about today whilst I was walking Ryan up at La Dole, and it was so beautiful, the sun shining, with no clouds. (it was b-e-a-utiful)...sigh.   On a lighter note: Happy 1st of August (The Fete National of Switz). I'm going to my commune's dinner tonight, to show my face, (I have been accepted by the federal, and its now back to the commune to be voted on in Sept for my Swiss n
