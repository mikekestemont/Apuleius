and we went on a short fishing trip in his 21-ft DuckWorth jet boat (nice boat indeed). It was quite the adventure getting out of the docking area... not only was it congested with boats but the log boom surrounding the dock had been moved making the boat ramp/dock entrance wide enough only for about 1.5 boats... also the chop was pretty bad (the usual mid-afternoon). These conditions made it difficult to maneuver. As we waited to leave the dock, the back end somehow swung close to the dock, much endangering the prop. I rushed back there to push us away from the dock... my grandpa turns the boat to avoid this... and we end up into another boat. I am back there pushing us away from the side of the other boat as grandpa powers away... leaving me in the drink. COLD WATER... indeed. Fresh off Mt. St. Helens. I later caught two trout, which I cooked (in butter w/ lemon and onion) in tin foil over the campfire. This is definitely the best way to eat trout.  Independence Day today... still no plans.  Gotta love randomly babbling on about worthless information.
The  Oregon Crusaders are DCI Division III Champions ... yay, FIRST PLACE.... good job guys (and girls), you know who you are I am proud of... many congratulations! Yep, your over- assured and over-confident posturing about being the best was not just that.  I wish I had decided to join the corps this year... Damn... and of course, you can all blame Mike for the big win  (I am big Cookie Monster fan) .   I went to Clark College today to register for Fall quarter classes. I feel somewhat lucky as I got all the classes that I wanted. I am only taking three hours of classes early in the morning and have the rest of the day off... and I will still get more high school credits than the regular 6-hr day. I am somewhat scratching out a schedule/plan hoping I will be able to get an associates degree by HS graduation. Free college is sweet... go Running Start.  I bought the 9/11 Commission Report. I have been reading the PDF version but got sick of it and decided I definitley prefer the tangible 'sit wherever ya want' version. This is probably the only interesting and actually-readable report that a commission has ever concocted... very, very worth while.  Tommorrow I go to the Clark County Fair to visit and help my friend with her pig exhibiting... that and I have been  lusting  for Fair food for about a year now. The destruction derby is also good for destroying summer boredom.
I found a photo showing the mess of boats out 0n the Williamatte watching the Flugtag...  urlLink click here . This photo was posted in the blog of one of the folks that was apart of the Pigasus team, which is also featured in the photo. Be sure to watch the Tonite Show w/ Jay Leno on Wednesday to see John Melendez report on the Portland Red Bull F
