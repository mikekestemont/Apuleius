been the best thing that could ever happen to me.  So the moral of this story? Well its just easier to be yourself in the long run. And its better too. So wipe the cum off your face, get off your knees, and wear something respectable. Thank you.  &nbsp;  Today I restrung my electric guitar. And played it.. its been a while. I havent used it since&nbsp;the band broke up.. I miss it. Not just the guitar but the band. Especially the band. I think we were supposed to jam sometime this week.. thatd be really nice. The biggest problem was that we started things too seriously. We didnt play for the music anymore.. we just played because.. why did we play? for gigs? just to say we were in a band?&nbsp;I dont know. Whatever the case was, it wasnt fun anymore. Maybe we've all grown up a little and can make it work this time.    &nbsp;  Somehow I doubt that.    &nbsp;  Can't wait until tomarrow morning..    &nbsp;   If you want to destroy my sweater,     I don't want to destroy your tank-top.     Hold this thread as I walk away.      Let's be friends and just walk away.     Watch me unravel, I'll soon be naked.      Hate to see you lyin' there in your Superman skivvies     Lying on the floor, lying on the floor     I've come undone
WELCOME BACK LAUREN    Im so excited you get your very own post. Its great to have you back. Our walk was fun and I got a chocolate bar, which is always good. I ate so much crap today though, I need to run.. I walked home is that good enough? My mom yelled at me. She is "disappointed" again.    &nbsp;  No work until Friday, when I work -what? A 4 hour shift? Swickedness. My feet hurt though.     &nbsp;  No one is on so Im trying to convince myself to go to bed... Go to bed. Hopefully it will be sunny tomarrow so that I can sit outside and do nothing and tan  all  day. I love summer.    &nbsp;  I wrote Kate a&nbsp;letter today. I was talking to her mom at work and she said it isnt too late to send one, and it reminded me that I should write one. So I did. Its pretty long too, and its basically me reminising [ach! I will never be able to spell that..] about our countless good times in ancient history. When both of us showed up that is.    &nbsp;   Listening To : Nirvana Unplugged in NY , the newest cd to my ever-growing collection.
You've got the disease.    Today I:   Worked,   Ate kraft dinner out of a bag,   Talked to Lauren!    &nbsp;  Who is getting home tomorrow. I cant wait. I cannot!    &nbsp;  I might be [hopefully] doing a cover of a No Doubt song with Grade 10 Girls. ..Aka Tyler Matt Cory and Corey. Which is amazing and I hope that Ill be able to do it because its pretty high.    &nbsp;  Cleaning out my room.. not cleaning, cleaning OUT.    &nbsp;  Work Sched:   Mon 7-3   Fri 3-Close   Sat 8
