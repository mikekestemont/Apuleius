night. I got to see Fuel, Magna Fi, and The Clarks. There was another band, but they blew, so I won't mention them.  I do believe that I am part of The Shallom Revolution beginning here in Mt. Juliet Tennessee at a lovely music club called Cafe Express. We are believers in God. We are 'Christian'. But we do not whore out the term to make money. We are here to fight out the ideas of 'different is bad' and that you must look and act a certain way to believe in god and that Christ is your savior. We're the ones who are breaking down the boundaries of religion and are here to accept anyone who wishes to join.   I started up with it because I never felt comfortable in a church. Well, my new church is held in a music club. We are young people who have a passion for their beliefs..and are there to speak and to listen and to let the Lord God speak through us and into other people. We don't, I repeat, we don't want to push religion down someone's throat. But if you were to ask, I'll say. We walk in love to the degree that we can. Our enemy is the syndicated, whored-out industry that religion falling under the name of Christian has become. That's what we all want to change. That's what I want to change.   Granted, I am moving to North Carolina within the next week and will not be able to attend meetings anymore. But i will be updated..and I will spread the word of the revolution to people in North Carolina. It's what I want..it's what I need..and it is a calling that I have come to answer.   Heh...No apologies for the rant there. I needed to say those things. Even if no one reads them, at least I know they're out there. And that there's a chance that someone may say, "Hey..y'know..that's pretty cool" and ask me about it.  I've changed a bit since I even last posted. I don't think I'm nearly as hyper as I used to be...but then again....i've been through a lot since then.   Attempted suicide, parents nearly splitting up, moving again, and the constant wondering about God and where He has a place in my life. At least one of those has been settled.  I'm starting my Junior year of Highschool on August sixth of this year. And I'll be starting it in North Irdell High School in NC. I hope to have a GLSEN chapter open (What? GLSEN? Christian? HUH? I believe in equality. I live a lifestyle of love and acceptance and support of those who need to be supported.) and hopefully spread the Revolution to some folks.   This should be interesting...seeing as I definately will be posting more often.  God Bless.
wow..   I've moved to North Carolina. My only computer access is the computer with the sticking keys at my dad's work place that I'm having to deal with right now...and my contacts are itching and I forgot the solution. P
