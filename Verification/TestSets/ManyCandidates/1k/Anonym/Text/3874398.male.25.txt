necessarily score runs.  What a great problem to have!!  I salivate every time I look at the lineup.  Womack    .293 Walker       .321 Pujols         .319 Rolen          .338 Edmonds   .300 Renteria     .294 Sanders      .252 (Reggie is in a funk, and with his weak glove it's the one place where I can complain). Matheny    .253 (Matheny is worth his weight in gold via his golden glove behind the plate).  V.  The two players that were "to be named later," have been named: Chris Narveson (AA) a 5-10 Southpaw who was a promising prospect (he has been strong as of late) and John Gall (AAA) outfielder, batting .297 with over 20 homers.  Neither have seen MLB action.  Seems like great tidings for the Cards, but many Fred-Bird faithful don't realize that with Walker comes a surplus in the OF.  Ray Lankford, who was scheduled to come off the 15-day DL last friday might ask to be released rather than be demoted.  You can't help but love Lankford.  Here's wishin' him the best--whatever decision he makes.   VI.  At some point I might have to demand that we do the impossible and find someone that wants to pay Cedeno his outrageous salary.  Trust me.  He'll clear waivers.  I'll be here all week.  Try the veal. -CJ
Interesting. Very interesting. Walker, for a minor leaguer and two players to be named later. AND Rockies agree to pay 7.5 M of Walker's 2005 contract. I like-a lot-so far. Who are these two? Walker received a standing ovation and was key in the 2-1 victory over the Mets earlier today. But are the Redbird faithful applauding a tad prematurely? I hope not. LaRussa is all smiles. I hope--as I have chanted so many times now-that we don't need to add better pitching instead. -CJ
A. Can't ask for much better.   B. Seems like every division leader is starting to seperate itself.  Cardinals are still 9 1/2 better than the streaking Cubs.  C. When Rolen reaches 30 homeruns it will be the first time in Cardinal history that 3 players hit 30+ in a single season. (Edmonds, Pujols)  -CJ
Deadline has come and gone.  I suppose the Card's big-wigs know more about this stuff than I do.  I kept hearing the same refrain from players and "importants" alike: "We don't want to upset the balance."  Marching to the beat of "If it ain't broke don't fix it," the Cardinals silently went through July 31--confidently.  We will see if this will be another year of the "sins of the past."   Most important transactions:(in order of importance)  A. Cardinals staying put  B.  Nomar-Cubs think they can make a run at the post-season by improving a glaring weakness.  Once they get there, they are relying on pitching getting healthier.  This trade should worry the most confident of Cardinal fans.  C.  Loaiza-Yankees gain a VERY quality starter to an already stellar rotation.  At what point will the Bombers stop spending $$?  Does Steinbrenner have a limit?  How much CAN he spend?  Shouldn't teams at some point wisen up and stop selling their "pennant-souls" to the AL NYers?  -
