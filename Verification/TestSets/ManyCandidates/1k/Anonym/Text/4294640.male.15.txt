trip post? can find character counts in fULL pERSONALLITY PROFILE, I BELIEVE. fuck, caps lock rememeber this:  urlLink http://www.ratemyteachers.ca/  it's a link Amanda sent me and I should look at it, adn she's talking to me. rememeber it. too baked to do it noooooowww. I can't spell. fucking stoned. no longer positive of immentent possession and or takeover. yeah fuck, now I'm afraid that this is being cause d by the aliens. cause that presents an element of the unknown, and ghosts pose more of a similiar, I-can-read-about-your-kind-in-a-textbook-somewherw kinda way, and Aliens are entirely unknown, making them scarier. I wanna post now, buh bye. beebur. brianna. banana. bbebur bananabriannablack. goodnight night.
this times not quite a million.  but for sure badness.  Alleah got the foodle sick.  Alleah feels bad about that.  Foo's diary reads, "badness!  I'm sick with what Alleah had.  Now how did I get that?"  yesterday was tons of fun.  Alleah, and Lo-Bo came over to the foodle's domicile, but they got distracted by Melly Belly.  and ended up being four hours late.  meh.  they eventually arrived, and me, Laura-Gator, the foodle, and 'lexis-girl went bush jumping (surprisingly amusing), and sitting on other people's lawns.  the foodle and I tackled each other constantly.  I have discovered that a lower centre of balance because of being a woman, coupled with intense shortness equals lots of tackling fun.  I've discovered that there is a distinctive difference between my typing and the foodle's typing.  I capitilize, and he does not.  hahaha.  ok, so it's not that funny.  Alleah discovered a sweet ass book yesterday.  it's called Oopsy Daisy's Bad Day, and it's all about bad trips.  Her cereal hates her.  It's alphabits, and they spell I Hate You, and it's funny.  this blog is surprisingly incoherent.  Surprising, because Alleah is writing this, not the foo.  You would think that with Alleah typing there would be some point, but no, no there isn't.  foo is on the phone right now, and we keep sniffing at the exact same time.    no smokes to smoke no drugs to toke and alchohol makes me choke.  that is why i'm bored. from the foo
Foo has just made a blog like all the other blogging whores.  Woo-hoo!  Foo is also talking in third person, because...he's Foo.  OK, you caught me, this is actually Alleah who created the blog FOR him, because he is without computer currently.  Somehow I'm going to have to remember his password and username cause he won't.  PALINDROME!!!  Foo, and I are palindrome buddies.  air five, Foo!  Anna.  hannah.  race car. 23:32.  he says, "sux0r mux0r."  hey!  nobody ever said this blog would be coherent.  anyways, Alleah, Blog Creator of God-hood is off to see if she can remember Foo's username and password!  which I won't!  boo-yeah!  see you all on  urlLink my blog , which we all know is the originator of cool blogs.  buh bye, all!  oh, and Foo?  I reserve the right to post on this blog at any time night or day, just because I know your password.  tyrancy in kingdom b
