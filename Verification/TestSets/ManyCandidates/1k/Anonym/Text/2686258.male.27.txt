around lately for my parents to go out to eat so I can tag along to get my fast food fix. I have pretty much wasted the last 3 weeks. And the next few aren't looking much better.  Why am I sharing this? Why should you care? I have no idea really. Maybe some of you out there have been through the viscous cycle that creativity ensues. When it works, its beautiful, when it doesn't, it's torture. But whatever, rehashing this stuff isn't helpful.  What I need to do is deal with the feeling of helplessness. I know it's all mental-- well, computer problems and alternators are very real. But if you really think about it they're only symbols of a larger problem. Just like the alternator, I'm not letting my starter engage, I'm not properly channeling my power to my engine. I'm just sort of sitting around like I'm waiting for something. Course sometimes I get sick of my own metaphysical bullshit. What I really want to do is just go get a job and get a nice little DVD collection like everyone else. I want to buy nice clothes for myself for once in my life. Or a bed. I want a paycheck that I can rely on every week. I want to feel financially responsible again. I'm tired of living hand-to-mouth. I'm sure its possible to be financially independant in Lubbock doing something you love... but apparently I don't have what it takes.  Or maybe my hearts just not in it anymore.  So I dont know what to say.  I dont really have another plan.  I've got a wierd timeline that I have to deal with.  I'd like to have an hourly job NOW making at least $10 an hour.  But I've got 2 more caricature events at the end of September that I've already invested in.  So I can't very well get a job and request off nearly 2 weeks right after I start the job.  That doesnt make the next 6 weeks any easier.  Who knows maybe after making a little money this weekend again will make me feel better.  But we'll see.  We'll see what the rest of the signs point to.   --Will

Circles   An old friend gave me the greatest compliment tonight.  It really made my day.. er.. make that my decade.   The last 8 years to be exact.  Good stuff.    --Will
I'm not usually into taking quizes, but this one seemed interested.  I don't know how accurate it is.  I never really considered myself the hub of society.  But whatever.       Category I - The Hub     You're a 'people person'.  Networking runs in your blood.  Consequently, you can move through most social circles with ease.    urlLink   What Type of Social Entity are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
