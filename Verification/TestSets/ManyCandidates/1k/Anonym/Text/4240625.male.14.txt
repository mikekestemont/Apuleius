with his trademark red coat. He wandered the planet then, living the life of the carefree gunman we know and love so well.Eighty years later still, he was back at the SEEDS ship. With an older doctor (certainly the same now from eps 20-21) and young Brad in the background and a young Jessica at his feet, Vash was going through the records of the people who had come from earth in the ships. Much to his surprise, he found the records of a man related to Rem! Revnunt Buskus, governor of July city**. Overjoyed, Vash decided to go see this man and tell him about Rem.Arriving in July City, Vash was horrified to find the governor recently killed and lying in his own blood. Knives was waiting there for him, too. Knives's only excuse was that now Vash would have nothing left to tie him to Rem. Knives lectures him then, saying he is the proof of human folly. Why can't he see it that way? But what's the good; why grow at all if you only grow to be more sentimental? Knives pulled a gun on Vash then, to which Vash responded by aiming both Colts, the guns Knives had made, at his brother. But Knives was faster this time, and shot Vash. Only his shot took off Vash's entire left arm--the arm that had been holding the black Colt. With a snap of his fingers, Knives then triggered the Angel Arm sequence in Vash with the intent to force his brother to dispose of the humans there---only semi-coherent, in-pain Vash had no idea what was going on, and only knew it was as scary and hurt like hell. But he was coherent enough to do one thing---aim the transforming gun at Knives. "Are you really going to shoot me again ... VASH?!" And so Vash did. Before the Angel Arm was fully formed, he fired at Knives, hitting him straight in the abdomen. But the Angel Arm created a terrible sphere of destruction like when Knives had fired the black gun before; the sky turned red, and the entire city, one of the Seven Major Cities, was completely destroyed. But no humans died as a direct cause of the gun: the millions only started to die later from exposure, and turning on one another in desperation.When he recovered and found himself alone in the rubble.. Vash... remembered nothing.With only the memories from before the July incident, he went on with his life as before: a wandering gunman, keeping in loose contact with his "family" on the orbiting SEEDS ship. But he had a new focus now, too: to find Knives, who he could only guess as being the ultimate cause for July. His brother, who was also now more dangerous... because when Vash had woken in the ruined July, the black Colt had been taken, and Knives now possessed that, even if he was now too injured to use it... for now. And so Vash vowed to find Knives.. and stop him, no matter what that might t
