mr anwar, i am so sorry for not always paying attention to you.) eeee...... boo to physics!   my life in poly is pretty cool.. i have had a lot of fun but i miss sam and sarah every day... :( hey, the queen's so lonely.... i mean i do have a lot of friends there but nothing beats having your bestfriends by your side!!   i have had lots of happy things going on for me! first of all... I GOT INTO STAGEARTS!!! i'm so happy... okay, i have to brag a little so bear with me... " HOW CAN I, THE EVER TALENTED QUEEN, NOT GET INTO THE SOCIETY?? " ha ha ha! i know i sound like a bitch but hey, everyone's a bitch at one point or another... i just let my side show pretty obviously... hee hee.... the drama -mama is back at work in full force again....   i'm still having withdrawal symptoms...no, the drama queen is not doing drugs.( what? you think i'd stoop so low?? geez...thanks a lot) no, i had the withdrawal symptoms since i left the dior boutique without buying THAT bag!!! boo hoo hoo!!! it's so adorable. when i was in there with ryan and stef, the bag was like " come, lilah, come... get me... i'm all yours..." sigh... my credit card was like lying in my hands and saying " come lilah, use me, use me, use me!!!" (man, i sound so looney and dysfunctional...eee....so scary) i nearly bought the bag when my mom's voice came to my head.." bone,(?!) if you ever use your card to get something so expensive, you can forget about having any money ever again" grr.... so yeah, she woke me up. i walked out of the boutique and since then, the symptoms never go away... oh save me! my heart is breaking....   p/s ryan and i are good friends again. we had a long (very long) talk and he talked to keith too... though keith still refers to ryan as the bastard and still cannot trust him, he has allowed me to chill with ryan as long as i tell him. cool huh??   i went back to school on the 31st of july for speech day and it was fantastic. i took like 71 pictures ( i think) and they all turned out goooooood.... i took a shot with charmer but that scrawny yi hong had to sneak into the photo as well... grr... i had shots with my drama folks too... eddee had his arms around me in every photo. ha ha ha so funny! i got a plaque for my distinctions and i was so proud when mom and dad place it in the living&nbsp;room so that everyone can see it...sigh... the whole event was very fruitful. i feel like i've finally graduated from chai chee... it's so sad... but then again, ties will never be broken as long as we persevere to preserve it... oh no... the drama-mama's eyes are wet!!! see lar.... my emotions and hormones are going haywire again....crap m
