less movement and more of brain power. Every thing that happend this week was  my fault ,should have done the Siemens interview right.
Being an outsourced system administrator without any real training is just waste of my time.I know now where all the companies lose their money,in unneccessary positions.  I know only to trouble shoot the network and take care of the system requirements ,update patches and anti-virus.This is no big deal .Anybody ,who has a decent knowledge of computer settings can do it.I am not the person,who did the networking in this place.I just have to detect the source of any error in the network.  I have to do an extra job of taking backup of anything that the users do. Well,my mistake began when,I got a mail from the region office to update Windows2000 patches,he also wanted me to do it before quitting. I just did it.I applied the patches to all the computers including the branch manager's . The next day,the manager calls me to his cabin and says" where are the mails,Iam just gonna lose my fucking job".I am caught in a fix.i called another Outsourced System administrator in another branch office.He told me that ,I have to just uninstall the patches to keep the Outlook Express working ,but the mails are lost forever.  I called the regional Administrator ,he says"You should have  tested it first before applying ,and,did you take the mail backup?" Oh,my god!I didn't take the backup,i mean do I have to take the backup? Well it all simmered down to after the weekend and a letter to their head offices saying that it was all my fault.  Ok,I don't have any problems taking the blame,as long as,the company outsources to my company.  Well,I have learnt a lesson.Always wait for others to take a step,before taking yours .You may never know!!!
Trying times for a nobody.I was thinking about this ,am I going to die as a nobody? I don't have a fast and trying career ,where I had to break my head to stay in a company.This is what others are doing. You know what,lift operators and security gaurdsmen in my country are the only ones without any career.They just have a stagnant life,they reproduce and they die.  Since,the life of an outsourced administrator is no better.The manager here in the metlife site is forcing me to have an insurance policy.The catch, he has to sign the customer feedback form at the  end of every month.This is called harassment at work.  I get a phone call from my parents everyday,after my brief illness.Mother says it is dad who is worried about my health. First few days ,I cut up cucumber and tomatoes for salad.My brother-in-law insisted that ,I eat cooked food.When ,I started cooking potato ,I again got a call from my dad.This time was,I could get gas in my  stomach.  Still ,I am cooking potatoes.I watch a lot of T.V.Atleast a movie after coming back from work.I find it hard to start studying when working and cooking man.It is quite tough for a b
