went by much more quickly than most days. Usually I can tell when it is the last class of the day, but today I was ready for one more. With that extra energy, Jennie and I walked home making fun of the demographics of our town.   lol, I could not think of the word "demographic" so I went out into my kitchen and gave its definition and right away my brother Jon pops up and says it. My other brother Ben just looked at him and started with the, "Haha, Jon is a bookworm!". I thought it was kind of funny. I asked him what it made me since I was looking for the word in Jon's defense. I did not stick around for the response. I did not want to know.  I need to walk or something, hearing about the "hott chicks" at robotics totally slaughtered any self confidence that I had today and I really feel as though I need to do something about it.   Arg, stupid bad weather.    ::looks at watch impatiently, waiting for 8:45pm to roll around::   I am looking forward to the two assemblies that I have tomorrow. One is for the seniors, then the rest of the school joins in. It is a slide show of pictures and memories for seniors...they play sad songs...speeches I think. This is one of the big things I had been looking forward to in High School:   In the auditorium, each class has their own section and it moves across the establishment. I believe that it is Freshmen - Seniors - Juniors - Sophomores. Well, after this assembly, the seniors leave for their senior outing and the order changes. Juniors bump up into the Senior position and are welcomed as the WLHS's newest graduating class. It is awesome and extremely symbolic...which is great for me as seeing that symbology is a big focus for me. Sentimentally n'such.  So, looking forward to that. Then, the Aces High assembly where I get to do a lot of public speaking...on stage...with a microphone!!!!!! I also get to do a bit of competition-wear and attitude for the day. It will be fun.   Robotics rarely ceases to make me happy. The only time it did not was when a person who was unafiliated was giving me a hard time and now that was a long time ago.  Now, I get robotics and Tycho to look forward to :-D  I also wish to apologize to anyone who tried to talk to me before the middle of 2nd period today. My mood was very foul and I should not have acted in the manner that I did.   The tech department, Riso, and thinking better of the situation on my mind brought me out of it and as most of you will notice had me back to normal by lunch.  Extremedies breaking off...hmph. :-P lol  Anyways, as Rils said to me earlier today "Sorry about my verbal diarrhea..."  That is pretty gross huh? I was amused. Talk to y'all later, hopefully some sooner than others. Take care!  -
