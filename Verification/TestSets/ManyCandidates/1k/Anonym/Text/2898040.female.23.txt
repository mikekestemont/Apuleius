drawn up a solid list for just yet). I basically know that my ideals are so unrealistic, even if I knew them, that I am doomed to a lack of any discernable social life. I have been completely screwed over by so many people in my life that I am highy hesitant to allow anyone that finds me even moderately attractive to be in a position to hurt me.  This has been the "sappy, poor me post." I promise VERY few of these in the future.
I try to stay myopic and stay out of most politics. But I have been eating up the NPR coverage of the Democratic National Convention. What a crock of crap. Even in the week following, I hear sound bytes of stirring speeches about nothing, and promises of making intangible things, like "hope," completely tangible to the common man. No one talked about the issues. What about gay marriage? What about abortion? What about the freaking war?! Granted, in this election, it's pretty obvious who to vote for in the "Lesser of Two Evils" race. But when there is actually an evenly matched pair of candidates, it seems to be based on who gave the most intensely middle-class oratory.  Let me speak in terms of something I know: catering. Let's say that I am going to throw you a party. It's going to be awesome! I'm not going to tell you where it is going to be, what you are going to eat, who is invited, or even when it is. In addition, I am going to suck about a third of your paycheck out so that I can pay for this awesome party that I am not going to tell you about for the next four (potentially eight) years. But it's going to be super cool, I swear!  How is it we can elect our leaders based on who promises us the coolest party? Ralph Nader is definitely promising the coolest party, but his party is on Jupiter or something. Totally out of the realm of reality. Kerry is promising the most elaborate party for the best price, which boils down to pans of Italian beef at the VFW, which is better than no party at all. Bush is promising the party with the most fireworks, but how many unqualified people have to blow their hands off with fireworks before we can get the festivities rolling?  If I could, I would run for office. A keg on every lawn! This would actually be cheaper than supporting welfare "baby-factory" mothers, donating to future terrorists overseas, and rebuilding the flaccid space program, combined. Who gives a rat's ass what is going on on Mars? I care about how I am going to keep my job in a downward spiraling economy, wherein a degree no longer matters, it's only how tight of a choke hold you have on your current position, no matter how shitty. If you can dig up some good dirt on your employer that helps too. (No luck on that one, my boss is an a
