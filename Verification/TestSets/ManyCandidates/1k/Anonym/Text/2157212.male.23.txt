at least go underwater). This made things interesting for the first few days of the week, since the weather wasn't very good and the water was freezing. Unfortunately, it was during these days that I was on a horrible losing streak, and I probably went swimming an average of three times a day. My luck improved slightly by the end of the week, but I still spent a lot of time in the water.  Also on account of the weather I only got in one good sailing day. It started out windy but way too cold, and then it got sunny but calm. But at least I got to sail some... I'd have been very dissapointed otherwise.  I got to spend lots of time with my cousins and my uncle and aunt, which is always nice. There have been years when I've been out there for three weeks and not seen as much of them as I did during this one.   They're all from the midwest, so a lot of them (well, just the men, now that I think about it) are republicans, which makes it somewhat interesting. My uncle tried to bar politics as a subject of discussion, but that didn't hold up very well considering the DNC was going on, especially after my cousin Tom showed up with his Sean Hannity book entitled "Deliver Us From Evil: Defending America From Terrorism, Despotism, And Liberalism."   Man do I hate Sean Hannity. I read over it a little, and there wasn't a single page that didn't disgust me. There was one part in his book where he said "As everyone knows, Bill Clinton turned down an offer from the Sudanese government to hand over Bin Laden, a miscalculation of enormous proportion" (or something to that effect). As his source for this claim, he references  his own book . I remembered this from Lies And The Lying Liars Who Tell Them- the whole story was based on the word of some private individual who claimed to be acting as a middleman for the Sudan, and he said they would give us Bin Laden in exchange for dropping the sanctions against the Sudan that were in place because they shelter terrorists and still practice slavery, among other things. But when the US asked them about it directly they didn't make the offer. And yet Hannity faluts Clinton for not dealing with a shadey guy claiming to represent a shadey country. Moron.  But anyway, I enjoyed the hell out of my vacation, other than the fact that it was too short. I'm just glad I got to go at all, considering I've only been working three months and I was allowed to take a week off. I would have been very upset to break my streak of 23 consecutive years of going to Canada.
Well, over my strong objections, I'm back from Canada. Lousy cushy job... oh well. I'm now about ready to collapse due to the whole time zone thing, so don't expect much out of me by way of an update just y
