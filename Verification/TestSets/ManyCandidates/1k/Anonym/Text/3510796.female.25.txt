complain about my "water tubing accident". On Sunday, the first day of my vacation, I went out on the lake for some high speed, water rushing in your face type of fun. I was doing fine for awhile, holding on tight~ like a virgins pussy ~ until my dad thought it would be fun to swing me through two waves coming together from other boats  PLUS  the wake from his boat. I ended up flying off and landing in the water, not knowing which way was up. Thank God for those life vests. Other wise I might have swam to the bottom thinking it was the way to air. The tube hit the waves so hard, the outer lining came off the inner tube. Once I got back to the pier, and walked on solid ground, I was told that I flew up in the air about three feet before I hit the water. My grandma was spotting and she said it looked like I did a cartwheel in the air. She wouldn't spot the rest of the week, nor would she even watch anyone from the shore. Pretty scary stuff I guess. But it didn't stop me. I went back out on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. Monday and Tuesday were rough because I still had a stiff neck and shoulders, plus the sun burn. All in all, the vacation was much needed and well worth the minor problems. FYI-the keg was gone Friday afternoon. I was surprised it lasted that long. But it only meant we had to go buy more beer for the weekend.   I       much to young to look that good....    Along with all the adventures, Friday brings most of the regulars on the lake. So around noon on Friday, two guys, I guessed they were about 17 or 18, walked to the ski doos that were next door to our cottage. Started to take the covers off and got them ready to take out onto the water. I was just looking, enjoying the view for the time being and my aunt says,"That one has some muscles." I just laughed. I was still thinking that they had to at least be  legal.  Later on that day, my uncle was getting the fire started and he asked one of them how old they were.        15!!     .......end of story.          good ole' war movies and some eat....    I came to the realization that a man, well, at least my dad, cannot go a whole day without some type of war movie and a good meal. If those two things aren't part of his day, cravings start to rear its ugly head and everyone fears Pops.            ~  peace.  Y  .  dmb  ~
