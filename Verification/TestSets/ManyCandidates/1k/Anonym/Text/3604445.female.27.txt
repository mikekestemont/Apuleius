He has known all of his colors for some time. He loves coloring, also gluing and cutting with scissors. He's pretty good at cutting- a lady at a church we visited said he's "advanced" for his age. Yep, huff-huff, that's my boy! Anyway, I'm gonna move on and see what all else this blog thingy has, I think it'll be fun! ~Ali
I have been getting stricter on Quaide about going on the potty. He's just sooo content with going in his diaper! Ughh! He does pretty well with peeing on it (that is, when I prompt him to) but he's never once went poo-poo on it. I'm really hoping that he's completely potty trained before he starts kindergarten! Haha. Quaide is recognizing all of the letters in the alphabet. His favorite thing to do lately is say all of the letters on our shirts or whatever else has lots of letters for him to read. I'm thinking he'll be reading some by the end of the year! He's so smart and I just pray that Trey and I can keep up with his capacity for knowledge. Quaide's been doing somewhat&nbsp; better with minding us. After our 3 week trip to Oklahoma, he came home a little more spoiled than when we left. :) He's slowly learning...
Having problems uploading pictures so none this time. We are finally home from our whirlwind visit to Oklahoma. 3 weeks still just wasn't enough time to visit with everyone that I wanted to. Quaide was so excited to be around all of his old buddies and now that we are back, I anticipate him having withdrawals. It helped that we were able to see his new friend, Jack, today. It's been sooo hot here today that it feels a little like home except without air conditioning. What is up with that??? Apparently, nobody has a/c around here. They say you don't really need it or something crazy like that but I say, it's worth it even if it is for just a couple of months a year. Why torture yourself for the sake of saving a few extra bucks??? Anyway, tomorrow my baby turns 3. Yes, 3 years old! I can't believe it. He still isn't minding me any better.... I'm waiting for that day to come. A lady at the ball field told me tonight that he'll get better when he's 5. Man, can I wait that long? Guess I don't have a choice. He ran away from me and Trey as we were going back to the car- he ran right to the play structure after we specifically told him to stay by us. He doesn't care what we say, he dances to the beat of his own drum as they say. His punishment was no toys or anything when we got home. He went straight to the bath and then straight to bed. He didn't seem to even notice. Ughhh!!! I love him though and tomorrow I too celebrate the birth of my own motherhood. I am so blessed to be his m
