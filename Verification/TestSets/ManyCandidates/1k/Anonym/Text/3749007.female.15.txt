I swear it did. It's the sun's fault. All the sun. Darn the sun.      I think that's all.   I shall be on my merry little way now.   Enjoy your life.   Go have a pickle.      Much Love--   Aub
It's been a while...please accept my apology, because it's only going to happen this one time.  That's all you're gonna get.  If you don't accept, then I don't really care.  There's not too many ppl that are actually reading this anyways..so I almost feel like I'm talking to myself, and if that's the case, then I fully accept my apology.        On to more important things..   DADDY'S HOME!!!      Friday, after Band Camp, Katie, Aly, Chelsea, & I went to the Sandwich Shop and had us some sandwiches...

Then Katy &amp; Aly skiied..and then we went back up to the house..Katie Guess had to leave..then we decided we wanted to go to DCI..but I had no other changes of clothes, so I found some of Katy's to wear..
