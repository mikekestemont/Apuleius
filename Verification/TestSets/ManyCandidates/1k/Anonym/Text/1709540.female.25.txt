who returns home after being medicated out of his gourd by his psychiatrist dad for all of his life, and leaves his meds at home. And, ostensibly, yes, yes it is. But it is oh so much more!  This is the best. Film. Ever. There are scenes in the beginning where the grainy texture and greenish light and film angles and everything threw me back to the days where I was so numb and blind and sick that it was the way I perceived the world around me. There are scenes where I laughed so hard I couldn't breathe, like Sam's "individual" dance. ("Bleaah!") There are scenes where I laughed so hard I cried, and then there were the scenes where I just wept, like when Andrew and Sam are sitting at the bar, discussing how if you don't laugh, you won't keep going.   urlLink BP  said last week, when I was feeling horrendous, that I needed to somehow finagle my way into a sneak preview of Garden State since it wasn't yet playing in D.C.  He said it would renew me, or just put everything in perspective.  It did both.  I went to bed last night brimming with ideas, wrote some of them down, and slept a happy exhausted refreshing sleep.   I'm already planning to get tickets for another showing this weekend, and this time, I'm bringing a box of Kleenex.  I don't think I can possibly do this movie justice without seeing it nine more times. But one more thing:  best.   urlLink  Soundtrack   . Ever!!!!!
Or rather, the housewarming was just warm.  Humid.  Hot.  Tropical, even.  Our a.c. decided to go on the fritz right as guests began arriving.  So what did we do?   Drink more rum, of course!  The  foggy bottom  was a hit.      Yum, Malibu.  The party ruled for 12 hours.  While there were no women passed out in the  cabinet de toilette  or people going home with their feelings hurt (at least, not to my knowledge), I would say that it was a good time.  Plenty of booze (a shout-out to the liquor store dudes at 17th & Corcoran for not laughing at us everytime we returned for more ice), plenty of food, plenty of people, plenty of everything.   Thanks to all of you who came and rocked with us, and a double thanks to those who brought clothes/cash for the Central Union Mission.  We raised nearly $100 and also have several bags of donations... not bad when most of your partygoers work at nonprofits.  My state at the end of the night was best described as "stupid drunk".  I suddenly realized my room not only reeked of gaggles of sweaty bodies but also of smoke, and that my bed had be the primary seat for this said party.  It didn't bother me at the time, cuz hi, it's a party, but after a while I freaked and told John I had to leave.   Who leaves their own party?   Does it make it better when I tell you I got a big greasy nasty Big Slice?  M
