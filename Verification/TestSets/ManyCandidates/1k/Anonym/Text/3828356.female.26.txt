we both WANT children, when is a good time to have them, are we ready, what about finances, etc, etc.  And some days, the itch is stronger than others.  For some reason, I was thinking about my rocking chair - yes, we even have a rocking chair, which, for me, brings out the momma urge even more so.  But first, a little background.  Dave and I were married on November 10, 2001.  We went down to Oregon for our honeymoon, and while there, we stayed in a place called Bend.  They had a store that sold hand-made Amish goods, and the store was filled with the most wonderful, home-made, solid furniture.  There was bedroom furniture, pie-safes, rocking chairs, quilts, etc.  My Grandma S. had given us some money as a wedding gift, and had told us to buy something with it that would always remind us of her.  Well, we bought a rocking chair!  It has arms and braces made of willow that's been molded, with boards of oak.  There's even a foot stool!  Anyhow, this rocking chair holds a special place in my heart, because I'd like to think that someday I'll be able to rock my babies to sleep, soothe their tears, and cuddle with them, all in this chair.   But with these dreams comes some fear and angst.   What if Dave and I can never have children?  What if that rocking chair remains empty?  What if we never hear the pitter patter of little feet on our hardwood floors?  I know that it is senseless to worry about such things, when we haven't even BEGUN to try to conceive, but it's a niggling thought, just in that back, dusty corner of my head.   I pray that God will bless us with kids...but what if it's not in His plan?  It's just a scary thought.  In my line of work, I see so many people who are pregnant, and don't want to be, and are there for an ultrasound, just to make sure that the pregnancy is still early enough to terminate.  And, it breaks my heart.  The gift of life...so precious and fragile, and so easy for some to discard like a piece of trash.  I SEE the 6 week fetus' heart beating...living...unwanted, and tragically, so unfair.  Anyhow, I DO pray that my rocking chair will hold my babies, and that we will have a wonderful family.  And if the Good Lord has a different plan for our lives, I guess we'll just have to deal with it.  -J.
I slept in this morning, and woke up feeling really blue and blah.  Do you ever get those "it's the last day of the long weekend blues and I have to go back to fricking work tomorrow" blues?  Well, if so, then you can empathize with me.  And then, this Elton John song popped into my head...which has nothing to DO with MY kind of blues, but it just felt right to post the chorus, courtesy of  urlLink Sing 365.com     "...And I guess that's why they call it the b
