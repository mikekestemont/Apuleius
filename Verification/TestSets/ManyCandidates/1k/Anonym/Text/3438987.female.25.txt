see friends when they're not working or otherwise occupied!  I even have to schedule time to see people!  I have to sit in traffic!  I can't walk around outside in my PJ's!  (scratch that-- I did it yesterday)  If I don't like a situation for some reason, I can't just leave town.  On the other hand, I drive 15 minutes to see people, rather than 8 hours.  I've slept in the same bed for a week-- and it's a bed not a sleeping bag!  I actually run into people I know!  If I can't see DC friends this week, I can see them next week!  I can eat a variety of refridgerated and even frozen food!  I dunno.  It's an adjustment.
...and I can hardly believe it's been 2 months, a nearly perfect 2 months. Somewhere along the way, concepts like Time and Home lost their meaning, and the question "what do you do?" signaled the start of a somewhat philisophical conversation. When I quit my job I had the sense that the summer wasn't an abberation but the beginning of a lifestyle, and I feel that even more strongly now.  Someday I'd like to call a place-- not just a town or city, but a specific building, Home. Now, however, things like rent checks and furniture and accumulation of any sort seem distasteful in a way. I hope I have learned to hold tightly to the important things, just as I've learned to let go of the inconsequential.  Introspection aside, here's a wrapup of the trip. Miles driven: almost 10,000 (average miles per gallon: somewhere around 48, best in the mountains and worst on the flat stretches) Total trip time: 2 months, 2 days New car name: Quark New CDs acquired: approximately 30 Number of states visited that I'd be happy to live in: 7 Nights spent scared out of my mind (for ridiculous reasons): 2 New beers to recommend: Alaskan Ale, Fat Tire, Moose Drool My only regret: not having my bike Item I'd like never to see again:  my green pants Item I didn't miss a bit:  blow dryer What I'll miss:  waking up in a tent, wearing a sweater in the summer, constant time outdoors, hostel lounges, fresh roadsite/farm/orchard fruit, friends' couches and porches...on and on  By the way, I keep meaning to say this-- if I saw you on this trip and didn't write about it on the blog, don't be offended! You'll notice I didn't really write about anybody. Half the people reading this know you and half don't have a clue who you are. We had a fantastic time, but it's hard to describe it for an audience. Thanks for your hospitality and for spending time with me-- seeing friends really made the trip.  I'm not sure what'll happen to my blogging habit now. I will probably continue to mull over the trip online, but don't feel the need to subject yourself.  You all are wonderful for keeping up with me!  Like I said, friends made the trip-- in person, over the phone, or e
