waiting for machines and I HATE that SWEATY smell. But I like my ass when it fits into my jeans.
urlLink    Find it  urlLink here . If you like fractals, this one's for you. I guess I could go into detail about how the jewel tones interact within the piece, blah blah, but I don't want to sound like some pompous art critic. I like it. That's all there is to it.
and therefore cannot be held responsible for my actions. Or lack thereof. Or any napping that may occur due to sugar crashes. Or strange warbling noises coming from my purse. Oh wait, that's my cell phone.
There is a small animal making "scratchy scratch" noises in the ceiling above my head, in my bedroom when I am trying to sleep. I think it's making a nest so that it can later come forth, and multiply. It's freaking me out. How do you get rid of the "scratchy scratch" type animals in walls and ceilings? I don't want them to die, they would start to smell. I just want them to go away.  The pudding (cat) is completely unconcerned. Next time I promise myself, I will get a fully functional kitty that hunts-down and frightens-very-much, scratchy-scratch type animaliosises. They do not belong in ceilings when I am trying to sleep.
Like the big mac I had for lunch. Get your mind out of the gutter.
N.B. I spent the entire weekend with the Golden Boy. 4 days of his unrelenting company. I did not want to kill him, not even once. This is good.   In fact, I think I love him even more now than I did on Thursday. Which is hard, but I guess it's happened.    Friday:  out for overpriced dinner at "Miller's Tavern" at Yonge and York Mills.    Saturday:  drive down to Niagara and help the Golden Boy set up for dinner for 13. Rest of day/night a little wine riddled haze. Excellent times.   Sunday:  wake up late, read and clean up while Golden Boy mows enormous lawn. Prep for another party - this time at a friend's house. By the time we arrive, most of the boys at the party are total train wrecks. One can hardly walk, and keeps falling down on the  lawn. There is a fierce slip and slide competition going on, involving many small injuries and a great deal of cursing. We leave the party early, not standing a chance at catching up with the drunks. Play a game of "The Simpsons game of Life" and sleeps it is.    Monday:  Back to Toronto to have dinner with Brother, a couple friends and Golden Boy. Go and see the Bourne Supremacy (quite good). Pudding (cat) is howling her head off for some reason, again. Tuck her under the covers and all is quiet. Sleep badly, strange dreams and now I have about 2 hours of driving to do, so that we can get some proposals signed.  Ugh.   Update  Two hours wasted as was pawned off on secretaries both times. Have spent entire morning driving around Toronto to no a
