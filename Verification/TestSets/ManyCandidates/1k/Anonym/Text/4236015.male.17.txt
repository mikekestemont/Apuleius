my attempts to revive the situation till I’m tired. Nothing is going to help save the situation. My last resort would be to mask myself, to put on an act. For the next two years things were rather under control with only occasional frays.  It was like a time bomb, ready to explode anytime and I know I would not be prepared for it. I had to continue masking my true self to delay this explosion as long as possible. I was successful till now and nothing had happened. Everybody was faking everything so as to prevent the ultimate tragedy too.  However the poison in me still runs deep. I know very well where I stand. I am just an accident who my dad had wanted to give away. He refused to visit me when I was born. I shouldn’t be here to disturb their peaceful life. Without me, my dad would not be stressed up about and money and played in stocks. Without me, my brothers would still be living happily with mum and dad. I felt very guilty. This guilt is even worse than the conflict between my love and hatred for dad.  Having masked myself for two years and be the clown at home, I had totally lost myself. I learned to be evil, practical and critical to protect myself. I could not afford to let myself get hurt again. I learned how to be a clown, a stupid clown to be laughed, for entertainments sake, without feeling lousy. That is just shameless in short. I had grown used to it. The worst is I became very sensitive and read a lot into things. To me, everything poses as a danger to me, my natural instinct made me be aware of everybody around me. I trust nobody and to a certain I am putting up an act in front of them. But now, I am really very tired. I want to stop all these right now, before my mind split between the true and false me.  My true self was locked up somewhere deep in my heart where I could no longer find it. But it still haunts me very often. At night when everybody was asleep, I would be crying alone. Boys shouldn’t cry. I told myself not to cry anymore ever since I told myself I had to put on a mask for as long as my dad and mum were alive. But the pain, emptiness and fear were intense. When people look at me and my family, who would ever understand how unbearable these feelings are. I really wish there is someone there for me, to encourage me to carry on for I fear I might give up halfway through. Deep in my heart, my true self had yearned for somebody to free it. Till now I am still unable to find that someone but I truly believe there is one out there, waiting for me and I really hope I can find that someone soon in my life to release the voice in m
