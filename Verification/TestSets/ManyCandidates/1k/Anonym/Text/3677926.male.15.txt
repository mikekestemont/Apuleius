opposing teams a tough time. Djemba-Djemba or rather should I say Djemba put in a good performance with some good tackles and he showed some aggression reminiscence of the glory days of Roy Keane’s career. Our second midfield of Kleberson, Liam Miller, Darren Fletcher and Djemba-Djemba should be good enough for the lesser teams. Smith could also play down the left side of midfield if called upon.  Our strikers are top quality. Van Nistelrooy and Saha will be our first choice with Smith and Solksjaer our second choice although Smith and Solksjaer will be playing a lot to allow van Nistelrooy and Saha some adequate rest. This will be something like what Sir Alex did in the trophy laden year of 1999 where he implemented a squad rotation to keep his strikers fresh to terrorize defenses in Europe and in England.  Arsenal on the other hand looked great for the post-Vieira situation. Their defense looked solid and should be even better if Campbell stays with all the rumors stating that he may flock to Juventus. I think that Ashley Cole is the best left-back in the world with Roberto Carlos. It really puzzles me why Ashley Cole isn’t used in the left side of midfield but they may do that when Ferdinand comes back. I can see Gary Neville (or Wes Brown if Gary keeps giving us rubbish) as right back, Ferdinand and Campbell as the two towers in the centre and John Terry or Ledley King as a make-shift left back. Ashley Cole could be in the left side of midfield with Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard in the centre and Beckham on the right. The attack of England could even be better with Wayne Rooney and Michael Owen and with the emergence of Alan Smith getting more experience in Europe, England could be a force to reckon with. Furthermore, with the likes of Owen Hargraves, James Miller, Kieron Dyer, Jermaine Defoe, Jermaine Pennant and Nicky Butt among others getting regular games and match experience, England will have the strength-in-depth that it has lacked all this while. I think that Paul Scholes still has the desire to play but I think that he wants to be assured by the new England manager that will come, that he will play in the position that he desires which is behind the two strikers in the hole and he will be guaranteed a starting place.  The midfield of Arsenal looks a bit stretched but still it looks great. New additions will be good for them although I doubt that it will be able to withstand suspensions and injuries. The attack of Arsenal still looks Henry dependent (although less) even though they have got Reyes firing at all cylinders.  The season will be starting for Man United this Wednesday and lets hope that they get serious. But, that aside, when all the big guns come back from injuries and when Rio starts against Liverpool, all the others in the EPL will be moaning about the dominance of Manchester United!! – Daniel Teh Chee M
