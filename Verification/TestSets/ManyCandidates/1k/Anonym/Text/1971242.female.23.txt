the next full paragraph or block, cuz these arent really paragraphs, but its for my own interest....  i guess i was having really bad cramps cuz i wasnt shedding it all.   so now im feeling 90% better than i usually do and im not overdosing on midol.  the only thing that really discombobulates me is why my legs get so sore.  thats really weird, but my body is weird.  just enough discomfort for me to want to stay home, but not enough to make me cry and writhe in angony...lol @ writhe.  so i think im done for now. bbl
so my birthday celebration ended up to be really nice.  everyone had fun and all the important people at least called me, came to celebrate, or took me out for my birthday.  i guess we are all going again this saturday, so it seems as though they had just as much fun as i did. unfortunately, my wish didnt come true, but i guess its not time for all that.  my whole weekend was actually good.  i got a massage on saturday that was great and my evening plans went well also.  sunday, stevie had a dance recital and it was soooo cute.  that night rohya and i went to jamaican gold and although i didnt stay, it was cool.  afterwards was great.    im glad that i have true friends and that i can count on them to be there for me just as much as i am for them.
"all the lonely people where do they all come from? all the lonely people where do they all belong?  I look at all the lonely people I look at all the lonely people"  i guess my wish isnt going to come true, cuz today is the 7th and i see myself.
so melissa and i went and saw miss Yaisa and her family out in ATL.  we got back 2 days ago and It's sooo nice out there in convington county. there are soo many wooded areas and everything just looks so different from california.  I need to get me a vacation house out there when i get older with a half mile driveway like this one family's.  people stare a lot out there thought, but i guess its just cuz they can tell that we werent from out there.  they are on that whole "cali girl" trip out there, but whatever.  there are ghosts out there too...   i feel like shit right now though.  i left work this morning feeling like someone was stabbing me in my uterus, but then i went back to help out cuz one guy took today off.  the herbal stuff was working really well for a minute, but i dont know what happened...i guess my body got used to it.  thats all bad though cuz i thought i was cured naturally with natural supplements, but i was sadly mistaken.  maybe i shouldnt take them so often and that might work, btu i need to do something
"why you gotta do me like that?"   life is crazy i tell y
