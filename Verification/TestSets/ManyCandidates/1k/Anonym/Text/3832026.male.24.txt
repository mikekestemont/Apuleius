after a 2hr consueling session wif one of my friend last sat night, i finally manage to let go of everything. It's their job now, not mine, they shld work according to their own style & if they screwed up, it's their heads... so with that in mine, i juz couldn't be bother anymore. Jeremy ask me to vet through the VAS for today &amp; i said no. It time he work independently. I have this feeling that I do not recongise Weixiang as my understudy. I juz feel that he's there as an extra helper, some sort of general office helper. I cannot bring myself to teach him anything. He doesn't seem really interested as well, disappearing from time to time and didn't bother to approach me. So who cares.. not my problem...  Great feeling, did some adjustments to my leave forecast &amp; found that hey.. 1/2 more day to go before the great holidays.. heehee... nice...
Wahh Lim mood liao right.. haha can feel the happiness you're in right now. Finally waited for this time haa..  Hmm for me rather stress this wk.. Though it's only the first wk and so-called orientation wk, but it's stressful adapting to university life. Always tot it's quite similar to poly life but i'm wrong. Here.. information regarding modules, tutorial n lecture schedules, even the programs for the orientation have to find out by ourselves (no more spoonfeeding). What's more.. feel abit of loneliness cos majority of my coursemates have known each other thru orientation camps n also some were from the same JCs. So for me it's like kinda outcast liao hee..  Haha.. but it was quite pleasing to meet Tang last monday. He's still the same lah.. but we chatted alot more than we used to be in camp. What's more surprising is we both actually saw LTA Loh, our ex PC! He's in engine yr 2 now.. Also saw LTA Azmin, alpha PC. He's in the same faculty as Tang.  By the way, did u guys went for the fireworks display at Esplanade last sun? I went and it was quite spectacular lah.. There was a big crowd ( the most pple i've seen in esplanade) but the actual display last a mere 5 mins though we waited quite long from the intended 8pm. Hmm not a wasted trip i would say.. But those who wished to see dun be disappointed. Last wk was performed by the US and this coming sunday would be Singapore (who self claim to be the best) and the following by Hong Kong. So make sure dun lose this opportunity again huh.. Bring ur loved ones for those who have or ask ur frens along!
It's been a long time since I woke up at this kind of time.. 12:10pm...haahaa, very nice weather & nice rain. The usual game playing again the whole day. So nothing eventful happen. Geez... There's really nothing to do. I can't live this kind of lifestyle for the next 4mths... i'll grow old, fat &amp; become useless... Hmm... muz think of s
