school. and this may sound kinda strange, but im kinda excited about school and all. i mean, i get to see everyone, i get to be in drama 3, and i even get to be sophomore class vice president! i think its gonna be awsome! ill prolly think its kool until we're a week into it all, and then ill be counting down the days until summer again. thats just how i am when it comes to summer and the school year. when its the school year i want it to be the summer, and when its summer i want it to be the school year! confusing and stupid...i know! anyways, i dont know if people are even reading what i write about anymore, cause i dont get any more coments from people. well at least not in the last 3 ive written. nat doesnt write anything anymore, holly wrote a few blogs on her site, and then i think she got bored with it, emily wrote one thing, and i dont think she knows what to do, lol, and kenny doesnt have the internet...or so he says...lol! and ellie is the only one that comments frequently on my site, and she hasnt for the last few blogs ive written. ya, well all of u guys better get with it...CHOP CHOP! lol! its about 10:22 P.M. and i have nothing to do and nothing to talk about. im talking to conner from oregon and thats it. and kenny was supposed to call me back today. but ive kinda given up on believing him when he says he'll call me back...cause he never does, lol! and its kinda getting on my nerves, but theres nothing i can really do about it, and chances are, me writing this is worth nothing cause he wont read it, lol! so i might as wel stop no and go leave him a long random message on his voicemail until it cuts me off cause im really "that" bored. and, dont worry, ill make it annoying! ;)
urlLink    sorry ellie...i couldnt resist, lol! this is to all my close friends; no matter how different we are as people, we'll always stick together as the best of friends...  urlLink
hey everyone! i havent written u all in a while, at least not since i headed to tracy last weekend. it's probably been because ive been hanging out with friends a lot in the past couple of days. and id rather be doing that than sitting at home doing nothing, lol. this summer has probably been the best one so far that ive had. not only because ive been hanging out with my friends more and having tons of fun with them, but because ive been building stronger friendships with them as well. and im starting to get the feeling that these friends are the good ones. the ones that i'll be spending most of my high school years with, and the ones that will last...even when we're old and grumpy, we'll be asking eachother to pass the prune juice...lol! ;
