done with the last one.  I could always up my membership to have 5 or 8 movies out at a time, but, really, that's just decadent, and normally, when I'm busy and working, that's not realistic anyway.  I'm almost done, anyway -- up to Season 5, disk 2 (hopefully arriving tomorrow).  That's one of the things I miss about not being on the road -- I don't get HBO at home, although, now that  Sex  is off the air, what do I care?  I liked  Six Feet Under , and can't remember if I heard they're bringing that back or not.  I'll have to add their latest season to my queue....  I'm going to end this post, for now, so as not to bore the poor reader to death.
urlLink    Siberian Iris&nbsp; urlLink     This Siberian Iris grows in what I call my "oak tree bed" near the front of my house.  I planted it at least five years ago, and it comes up reliably every year.
I've decided to create an on-line gardening journal, of sorts, after I found this exceptional blog site.  I hope to be able to post some pictures from my garden, describe my plants and plantings, rave over successes and moan over failures, and perhaps share links to great gardening websites I run across.  Thank you for reading my very first posting!
urlLink     Rose - 'Blue Girl', photo taken in my garden, May 2003&nbsp; urlLink     &nbsp;  Up until this year, the rose in the photo above was the "bluest" rose available, and, as you can see, calling it " blue " is a bit of&nbsp;a stretch.&nbsp; There are definitely faint&nbsp;tinges of periwinkle/lavender on the edges, but really, any&nbsp;normal person taking a quick glance&nbsp;at that rose would call it pink.&nbsp; You have to look really hard to see the " blue ".   There's a very&nbsp; " purpley " rose called  urlLink  'Rhapsody in Blue'     that's been available in the UK&nbsp;for a few years and is being tested by AARS in the US right now, and as gorgeous as it is, I think the average layman would still call it purple.&nbsp; That won't prevent me from including it in my garden though -- I love the color.&nbsp; I've read it will be available for retail sale&nbsp;in the US&nbsp;by 2006.&nbsp; I can't wait!   I do have another " blue " rose that grows next to 'Blue Girl', called 'Lagerfeld', (both are Hybrid Teas),&nbsp;and it&nbsp;is even less "blue" than 'Blue Girl', but since blue is not a color natural to roses, beggars can't be choosers.  &nbsp;  Until now.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  There has been some recent,&nbsp; urlLink ground-breaking research  in the area of blue roses, and we could see them in florist shops as early as next Valentine's Day.&nbsp; (Wouldn't that be an  interesting  message to send your loved one -- a bouquet of  blue    roses!)&nbsp; A biology/biochemistry/botany geek might appreciate a more scientific explanation  urlLink here &nbsp;and  urlLink here .  &nbsp;  I, for one, cannot wait until such a true- blue  rose is available to purchase as a shrub to be planted in my g
