today was great. I woke up around 11 or so and got my shower and went to the grocery store with mom. When we got back we ate lunch and we had to fix a cake to take to my aunts to cook out since my dad has to go to Pennsylvania tomorrow. well we fixed the cake and while it was cooling we went to the peoples house who we're buying my puppy from and i got to pick her out. I'm gonna either name her Libby or Corona. She's SO precious!!! only 2 more weeks till she get to come home with me!!**YAY** then after we came home justin called again around 4:30 and said he'd be at my aunts around 6. then we went to my aunts and when we got there daddy shattered the back glass of his bronco...how in the world...i dunno...i guess it was just too hot or somethin, who knows?! then we swam for about 2 hours i guess and Trey and Cole and Brandon we're all over there with Mason...so they swam with us. i got out and changed and go ready before justin got there then when he got there we ate and talked for a little while. Then Justin,me, and Tyler all rode over to Goospond Ampatheater and met up with his mom and dad and talked to them before the fireworks started. then we watched fireworks and the last couple of minutes we left to try to beat the traffic well we did pretty good i reckon... i think i counted only 4 people that walked/ran by that i didnt too much half any respect for...justin counted like 20...lol..nahh but there was a lot of em'.LoL. then we stopped by sonic. and he brought me home. but all in all today was great...i got to see my baby and i got to be with him to watch the fireworks. oh yeah i left out 2 things...LoL...*i believe they we're "togedda" for real!! dont you?* and ☼i forgot to tell you this but somebody asked me today when our wedding is gonna be, to let them know. i was like...hehe☼  welp i'm out...i have another long day ahead of me.        ~☼*I Love Justin E.
