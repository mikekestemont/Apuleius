exactly what I love about him. His love and passion for what he wants to do. I remember that a long time ago when I posted that personal ad, I wrote that I was looking for someone who was passionate. I said that I didn't care what he was passionate about it could have been insects for all I cared the keyword was passion. Ask and you shall receive. I got what I wanted and I wasn't even aware of that until recently. Another thing was how he described all the things that were going on in the theater. Because it was the movie theater he used to manage, he knew everything about it. He told me how that was his life for about 11 years. The funny thing was that when he talked about it he talked as if he was still part of the company. This made me realize how much it affected him to loose that job. In a perfect world I wish I could give him that dream back. He used to tell me how he created this midnight program where one night of the week they would run old classic movies that a lot of people didn't get to see in a big screen. He was like a God to all these young kids who were interested in seeing movies that came out when they were babies. Years later he still "The movie guy". When we went to San Francisco for his birthday we went to see "Spartan" in this old little theater house it was so nice and cozy. I wish we could have that. Buy an old theater, make it spiffy and have him be the King of the theater. Men are hunters and they crave that "King of the domain" position. He can have the limelight. I'm fine with the supporting role. If having that will make him happy, then I'll be happy. I know it can be a financial risk but I believe I can help make ends meet. I'm going to try visualization. A loft in San Francisco, lazy Hobbes & Brando on the couch, Carl owning a theater, me helping people with massage. Life will be grand!! All we need is a little push off of this plateau.
So Atif found himself another name and decided to pester me yet AGAIN. Now he has the nerve to tell me that I love him. I tell him to leave me alone because he's crazy and he says that's my way of showing my love for him. It's one o'clock in the morning in Pakistan yet he says he's been waiting for me to talk!!! What the fuck is his problem? I put him in the 'ignore' list but he goes and gets another name in order to talk to me. The guy is a complete lunatic. I mean I've had my share of experiences with weird people online but this guy is seriously crazy. On the other side of the spectrum though, I did find a really cool friend. Hi Mike :
