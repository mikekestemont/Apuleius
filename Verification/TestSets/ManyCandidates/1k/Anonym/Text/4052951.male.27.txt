And who can forget Norman Mailer's novelization THE NORTH MEXICO ALL STARS (later made into a semi-successful movie starring Mark Harmon as Steve Garvey)?  I certainly haven't. Nor have I let Karen Stanfield's indispensable SOUTH CALIFORNIA MOMENTUM: HOW THEY GOT THERE leave my bookshelf. And the fact that Schwartz's book touches on humor is  hardly  revolutionary. This non-elusive topic has been covered in no less than three excellent books - and I'm not including '84 Padres pitcher Tim Lollar's hilarious inside rag IN THE BULLPEN WITH THE PADS: JOKES AND STORIES. The books include:  1. LAUGHING ALL THE WAY TO THE PENNANT by Ken Maxwell (includes the famous "egg incident." 2. SLIDING INTO FIRST BACKWARDS: THE 1984 PADRES AND THEIR QUEST FOR WINS AND LAUGHS by Justin Mortimer (doesn't highlight the "egg" incident, but gives invaluable tidbits of humor from utility player Tim Flannery and outfielder Carmelo Martinez) 3. IS THIS IS A STADIUM OR A COMEDY CLUB? LAUGHING WITH THE 1984 PADRES by Wilm Polhelm. (Translated from German. Though the translation is sometimes confusing, Polhelm gives timeless anecdotes about Craig Lefferts and Champ Summers attempts to outdo each other on a Philadelphia road trip in May, 1984)  And still also notable are the many biographies and memories written by members of the 1984 Padres, eight in all - which I won't mention here. I will say, however, that the best of them is by Kevin McReynolds: SCOTTISH IN SAN DIEGO.  So I didn't even bother to read HITS, HOMERS, AND LAUGHS: IN THE DUGOUT WITH THE NL WEST CHAMPION 1984 SAN DIEGO PADRES, ONE OF BASEBALL'S GREATEST TEAMS by Ed Schwartz. Sorry Ed, but I've read it before. You can teach a new dog old tricks. But unless the tricks are compelling enough to maintain an audience, the dog will lose interest and might run away.  - Andy Black, Andytown.com
