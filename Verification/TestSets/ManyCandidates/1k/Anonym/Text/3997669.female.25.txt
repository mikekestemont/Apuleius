checked the little door to their hutch and the hinge has been attached so that they can go outside from the hutch but can't go back in. After trying to think of what to do, Guy grabbed a large stick and poked it through the fence to hold the door open and then weighed the end of the stick down with a large post. This kept the door open and one of the rabbits went straight for the safety of the hutch while the other one, scared, stayed in the furthest corner from us. Then we realised that there were other rabbits inside the hutch and some of them were coming out and going back in again now too.  Pleased with ourselves, we started praising each other's kindness and walked back to the house (the whole fiasco had taken us about 25 minutes) While walking back, I said to Guy "You don't think they were deliberately separated because of their sex do you?" to which he replied "Don't even say that" Anyway, regardless of that, the ones outside should have at least had some shelter and food outside, which they didn't.  Tonight we're off to see The Streets in St Kilda - if you don't know them, they're some guys from the UK who sort-of rap (I don't know what you'd call it) about everyday stuff, for example "Fit but don't you know it" about a good looking girl who knows she's attractive. It's mostly blokey sort of stuff - checking out girls, drinking beer, etc. The songwriter/singer is from Birmingham but moved to London in his youth so he's got a half and half sort of accent. Should be good.
Well I'm back to reality now - Guy and I arrived back from Newcastle yesterday afternoon. It was lovely up there, but it didn't seem long enough (never does!) We spent a great 4 days just hanging about mostly - I was roped into upgrading my Dad's PC to Windows XP and then sorting out my Mum's laptop with Windows 98. They had never done any Windows Updates so it was having loads of problems. Anyway, we had my Stepmum's birthday on Friday night and I got to catch up with all of my relo's, we also went out on Dad's (small) yacht on Saturday, then out for dinner with Mum and John on Saturday night. It was about 4 degrees warmer than it is down here in Melbourne, but the temperature dropped from about 18 degrees during the day to about 4 degrees at night, so we felt it more than having 14 degrees during the day and 8 degrees at night. Those 4 degrees certainly made a difference though, especially with the most beautiful clear blue skies you have ever seen!  The rats were happy to see us back and we're taking them to the Vets again tonight to get them some medicine for their mites as the spray hasn't worked. Apparently you can give them a small dose of sheep/horse medication for worms/parasites so hopefully it will w
