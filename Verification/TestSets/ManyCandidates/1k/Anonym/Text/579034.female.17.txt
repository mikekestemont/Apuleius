to cry, it was torture, you have no idea.   Chicago Part 2:  very brief... only for one night, didn't do much.   The Hamptons:  It was great... Mick and I had a great time... we went to the beach, shopping, I got interviewed for a thing on CNN but they didn't use me... out to eat every night.. we saw Howard Stern, Kelly Rippa, and Candis Birdman.. we went boogie boarding, Mario and Mick became best friends.. it was great... being with Mick after we were havin all those problems was really good... it was great to be with him but it wasn't as hard as it used to be to say good bye... i missed him and still do miss him but i was okay when i got home i drowned my sorrows in a bag of pizza flovored Goldfish.  So now i'm home... i saw people yesterday, saw the girls at track and then hung out with deb and the boys... it was great i really missed all of them... today was pretty boring, i did nothing, had no one to do anything with... erica was away, deb was at the beach, melly was with greg... and im sure everyone else had things to do too... so yeah.. maybe tomrrow will be better. x0x
well... i'm home... not that i didn't miss everyone, but, god i wish i was still there... if i were to do a rundown of every day and every funny word or phrase or how i felt about this and that it would take up so much space that blogger would just like burst... all i can say is the whole time i was away, i was in this sureal fantasy world... filled with laughing for 10 minutes straight, hugs, staring contests, scary movies, tears, more hugs, pools, hot tubs, ugly guys from Ohio who wanna drink all the time and have bad teeth, awesome accents, disney world, universal studios, risk lord of the rings style, james eating restaurants out of business, chicken, getting injured in some way shape or form just about every day, beating james at air hockey, james calling me fat (told you i would never live that down lol), elliots abysmal language around young childern, elliot stealing all the coke from the "tean jam", james and his indiana jones hat, pigs that walk n wiggle their noses, teddy bears, running around disney resorts, running to catch monorails, catching the last 30 seconds of the half hour fire work show, failing to cheat propperly at mini golf, more hugs, weird noises, james flexing his back muscles, not-cho-cheeze, and a few more tears.   i love those guys... god broke the mold... i been a mess all day and forcing myself to sleep so i won't have to think about how much i love and miss them... james thanks for the kind words, shawn thanks for having shoulders, elliot thanks for putting up with my long showers and not hiding other the covers every morning when i woke you up.  here's to the nights guys  x
