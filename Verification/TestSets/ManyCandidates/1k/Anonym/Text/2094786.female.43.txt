Daniel Boone Logan Jr. was born Oct. 6, 1896, and is the youngest of the four children.     From the Lawyers and Lawmakers of Kentucky - Published by The Lewis Publishing Company, Chicago, 1897.   	 Daniel Boone Logan, of Pineville, was born in Carter county, Kentucky, on the 23rd day of April, 1858.  By his life he has honored the name which he bears and which is so inseparably connected with the history of the state.  The family name, too, is closely interwoven with the annals of Kentucky, for the great-grandfather, James Logan, came to the wild and undeveloped region known as the "Dark and Bloody Ground" long before there was any attempt at government organization.  William Logan a native of Scotland and the first of the family to come to America settled in North Carolina, whence he removed to Kentucky, locating near Shelbyville.  James Logan was then a child.  He afterward participated in the Indian wars and was shot, scalped and left for dead at the battle of Blue Licks, but life was not extinct and many years afterward he told the tale of the cruelty and treachery of the savage.	   PS.  I have proven, with James Revolutionary War , urlLink pension application that James was from Washington Co., PA.  Also, I have never proven or disproved the ancestry of James Logan.  According to the pension application, James Logan came to Harrison Co., KY, not Shelbyville, KY.  The pension was disallowed by the Federal Government because his service was in 1792 and the Revolutionary War ended in 1782.  Henry Razor, below, was at witness to the pension application of James Logan.  See my web page for a complete viewing of the pension application. Henry Razor, b. 11 July 1771, d. 7 Feb. 1869, buried in Slaty Point Cemetery, Farmers, Rowan Co., KY.  Henry Razor's wife was Elizabeth Gantz.  He was born in Shepard's Town, PA.
