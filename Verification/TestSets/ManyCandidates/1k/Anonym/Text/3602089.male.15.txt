her hair done.  She is being a bridesmaid for her one friend this afternoon.  Her hair was halfly-braided, halfly-twisted, with small butterfly clips everywhere and small curls in the back.  As soon as I step foot onto Paris concrete, I am going to buy fifty-four crepes...fifty-four because everyone else always picks a stupid number like "fifty" or "fifty-two".  Why did Coca Cola get rid of their "Surge" line of soda?!  I thought it was quite good...I know it's weird for me to be talking about it now since it happened many months ago (before Christmas), but I am just now realizing how much I miss it.  I like most all sodas except for Diet Pepsi (Pepsi One is ok though...).  I love the vanilla colas.  If you like both Vanilla Coke and Pepsi Vanilla, check this...v. coke contains artificial vanilla flavorings while pepsi v. contains pure vanilla extract.  Also, I mentioned in an earlier post that C2 contains phenylalanine that causes cancer in lab rats...Pepsi just introduced Pepsi Edge which has half the sugar and carbs (same thing as C2), but does not replace it with the fake sugar!  Amen to that, Pepsi!  They seem to be thinking more about what's "healthy in an already bad-for-your-body soda"...which is enough for me.  Even though Pepsi tends to go the natural way, I still buy Coca Cola more now just because the shape of the bottle is more appealing to me than the regular Pepsi bottle...lol...what a tart...
Since I got my iPod from Apple about three months ago, I have gotten very poor quality output of bass and terrible sound distortion on my favorite kind of music, Russian Techno (specifically, the artists Русский Размер, Вирус, and Руки Вверх).  I have used a little music format converter for a while and decided to fool around with the bit rate and file type.  I converted some .WMA files into mp3s because Apple won't play windows media audio formats...go figure.  Lol...anyway, I discovered that the songs sound perfect, except there is still not enough bass to satisfy me.  I don't exactly know what I did differently this time to change the format because all of the settings are the same as last time I did this.  Anyway, I have only eleven more days until I fly to Europe for twenty-one days, which is going to be very fulfilling for my travel craving for a few months.  The drivers' saftey classes I have been taking all of this week and will continue to for the length of next weeks is total hell.  The teacher acts like a younger version of Mr. Rogers on delta-9 tetrahydrocanabinol, or even crack cocain...it doesn't matter, he's a little too happy in the mornings but is annoying at the same time, which is nearly impossible for the rest of us.  Now, I must look for my camera tripod before my trip so I don't miss the perfect long exposure shot of the Notre Dame cathedral...this house is such a mess I'll never find it in the piles of shiz flooding my "
