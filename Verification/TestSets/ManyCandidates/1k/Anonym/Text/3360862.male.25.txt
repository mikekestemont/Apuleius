was swimming and fireworks by the pool, and me talking to a girl from Steven's Point, crap, I'm really bad with names,,,but she was really nice.  The Woodbury Fireworks came on for a little bit, then after that, 3 hot chicks came by in short skirts and nice shirts.  They were in the pool about to get naked, when "cry baby hot chick" said she couldn't continue stripping her clothes since her panties were attached to her skirt.  What the hell, almost the awesomest thing in the world was about to happen, but NO, i was shot down by the stupid "Panty-Skirt In One" deal, again!!!  I had conversations with Susie as she remembered what had happened the last time we were together (@ Perkins @ Pete's party).  And I kept saying, "i'm so sorry" and "i was a jerk" and "i think you are cool."  Which is all true.  I was laughing at her when she was trying to get the CD player to work, it was very funny.
I will be attending Dan's "kick ass" party on July 4.  I'll be in La Crosse Friday night through Sunday mid-afternoon, and I'll drive back to Dan's for Intoxication and Fireworks (my two favorite activities,,,,, besides getting laid).  Last night produced another fine fine night, involving St. Paul Saints, hot girls with nice ass pants, and a Saints schedule magnet for my fridge.  Shaggy, Dirty and I sat in the left field bleachers.  We had an excellent view of "hot girl" and "devil girl."  Shaggy kept his mouth shut while Dirty and I had a blast telepathing with "hot chick."  I said "Stand Up Hot Chick,"  and, she stood up..."Awesome."  I said "Touch Your Boob Hot Chick," And, nothing happened.  I'm disappointed in my telepathing abilities.  Dirty and I went to the ATM, and as I was getting cash from the merchandising shop since the ATM was broken, Dirty spied on the ATM maintenance people and saw them put in the combination for the lock.  He jotted it down in his memory, of which was translated into my cell phone later.  We joked about stealing money or selling the combination to the Mob, but we're pretty much all talk.  I got 2 cell phone numbers yesterday.  Two people had lost their phones at the game, for which the announcer repeated the numbers over the loudspeaker, and using quick thinking and finesse, the numbers were stored in my cell phone as "Lost Phone" and "Lost Phone #2."  I called one of them, and asked for Bill (bill murray), but they said "Jill?" and I said "yes."  They said wrong number, then I hung up.  Fun Stuff!!!  Rachel joined us later in the 5th inning.  She drank with us, and then we decided to go get a brat.  Rachel ordered first, and I hear the brat guy go "no more brats."  I was exasperated to hear such a thing.  I had to settle for a burnt hotdog with a crappy bunâ€¦.Yee Ha.  I woke up at 11:30 today, therefore, late to work as a
