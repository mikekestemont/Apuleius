from our first visit to North Suburban Family Physicians. We thought there was going to be an exam etc, but it was mostly paper work and educational. Jessica did have to give blood and she was very brave. I don't know if all of the stuff has sunk it yet, but we go a lot of papers to read through later. We also took care of most of the insurance paper work and filled out our admissions form for  urlLink the hospital . So now, when It's Timeâ„¢, we just call ahead and go right to  urlLink delivery .  Our RN Pam was really nice and I'm glad to know that she also works the phone line so we can call if we need something.  Lastly, we got a free diaper bag from Similac with a free can of formula mix, an insulated bottle pack, a coupon book, a booklet on breast feeding (interesting from a formula company) and a teeny little amount of diaper rash ointment. Let the free stuff begin!
Jessica cut a full foot of hair to donate for  urlLink Locks of Love , so I'm posting a photo of her new hair style (and her donation).     And here's another pic I took, just for fun
Saw the doc on Tuesday for the first monthly checkup. Everything went swimmingly. We had the chance to listen to the baby's heart beat as provided by a doppler. I must admit it was pretty cool to know that a tiny little heart's already beating. Jessica was so excited she teared up!  And, of course, we had a way of recording the moment. So you can  urlLink listen to the heart beat  yourself.
I seem to remember hearing that it will get better when you are done with the first trimester.  Well, I have always thought my due date was a little off.  I think I am really due on the 26th of Feburary.  The fact that I threw up four times already today seems to lead me to believe I am right.  We shall see.....  We haven't done much this weekend.  We went walking twice. And we just got done watching "Cheaper By The Dozen".  Yeah, we won't be having 12 kids.  That was out of control.    I am really looking forward to next weekend when pre-season football games are on.  GO VIKINGS!!!
So I am getting really excited for this first trimester to be over. For some reason the nausea has seem to come back full force. I have decided that TUMS are evil. They only make the situation worse. But enough of the complaining.  Mark brought home another freebie baby bag the other day. It was from Medtronic. It had all kinds of samples and things in it. But the best thing of all was a baby shirt that says "Future CEO" Medtronic. It is stinkin cute!!! I heard they also make baby scrubs and so we'll have to look into getting some of those for the hospital.  We go to the doctor again on Monday.  Can't wait to hear the heart b
