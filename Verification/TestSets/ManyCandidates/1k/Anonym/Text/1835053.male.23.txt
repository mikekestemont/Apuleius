I developed a liking to them suddenly. Probably am missing home? Or probably I want to be in my dad's position, listen to the songs and feel just like he feels. Watever the reason be, I'm homesick now!    I am thinking of the nights that I used to spend at Hyderabad, my first home. I used to be at the Officer's mess library or with a friend in the DRDO colony at 7pm. I used to leave for home around 9. I remember the lonely streets outside the quarters. They were so peaceful. My driving was so fast on these streets that my nose would be numb by the time I was home. I can still feel the long lonely drive back home, the wind that blew my hair and the autos that used to pom-pom as I drove by rashly. Home was so relaxing. I knew that there was nothing being expected from me at this point of time, and there was in fact nothing to do at all. My mind would be totally blank while driving, and oh boy, how awesome an empty mind is! The same routine would follow on returning home: eat, read some novel and sleep off.

As I keep thinking, I get more and more of them. So I stop and get back to my books to study for test, remember? And here I am again thinking how I used to study, either alone or with Narsi and stud or with Pondy in his hostel very very late at night.    Huh! wish I could get those days back. Life here is not so jobless at all. There's always tension on my mind. ALWAYS! Even on weekends when I'm enjoying I have the feeling that I gotta do so and so. That's what makes me feel I should be getting the good old days back.    This reminds me of a talk with Meling, a Chinese lady here. She was showing me some new born cats. I said I wish I was just a child like them. She looked surprised and said,"You must have had a really good childhood." That's the only time in my life when I felt I really had a GREAT c
