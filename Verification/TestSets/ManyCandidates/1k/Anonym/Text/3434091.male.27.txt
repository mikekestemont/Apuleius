of how to provide password information to each user.  I don't believe giving the password information over the phone, or by mail, is a good idea.  Perhaps allowing each user to create their login information when they actually go in to vote would be a good idea.  Alternative forms of authentication, such as smart cards or biometrics are not feasible in the short term future, since they would require a significant rollout of the new technologies.      Replication   A website hosting a key government function, such as the Internet Voting Initiative, could one day be the victim of a cyberterrorism, or a physical terrorist attack.  As such, it is important that the project be set up as a multi-node, distributed application, with database replication.  It may even be a good idea to get several universities involved in hosting the application.   Architecture   Personally, I have spent the vast majority of the past four years working with Microsoft technology (ASP.NET, C#, and Microsoft SQL Server), so I would be hard-pressed to make good decisions on the architectural implementation of this project.  In general, I am a proponent of highly organized code and object-oriented development.  As the application would also need to be highly scalable, I would lean toward recommending a combination of J2EE and Oracle, hosted on a Linux server.  I know that vendor lock-in would not be desired, but perhaps Sun and Oracle would freely support such a benevolent project, based on the positive publicity they would receive.        Accessibility to General Public   One of the key issues to implementing this project would be to convince the government that we would see wide-scale acceptance and usage.  It will take a long time for the general public to become familiar with concepts such as blogging, metamoderation and flamebait.  The Internet Voting Initiative would see fierce adoption by the political blogging community, and, most likely, the Slashdot community as well.  It is true, that, in the beginning, the results of such online voting and commentary would be skewed towards technically inclined.  According to  urlLink this BBC News Report , half of all American households now have Internet Access.  The internet is becoming more and more essential to everyday life, and by the time this project was ready to be deployed, the vast majority of households will have an internet connection.           Computer hardware and networking equipment is cheaper than ever.  Publicly accessible computers are available in libraries throughout the United States, and it would not take a great deal of expense to provide dummy Linux terminals with limited access for free public use in more public places. I do not believe public accessibility to internet accessible computers will be a major within another two or three years.  How do we proceed?  The Internet Voting Initiative is a feasible project that could effectively be used to provide greater accountability between the United States government and the nation's citizens.  The biggest hurdle I can foresee is convincing the government of the need for such an initiative, along with showing that there is support for project among the general p
