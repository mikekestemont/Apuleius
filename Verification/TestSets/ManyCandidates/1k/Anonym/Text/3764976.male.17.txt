ass and, in conclusion, I was fucked over by my own actions. God I am such a loser. If you need proof of this, look at how large this post is. I am a douchbag. Well, a cuddly, lovable douchbag, but one nontheless.
I'm trying to write some real killer lyrics right now, but nothing is coming out of my head, thus why I am updating this. I noticed that I am mainly a pop-punk lyricist and Hardcore music is harder to write for. Usually, I write about the thing I know best, heartbreaks, and seeing everyone has had them I feel that they can connect with it easily. I'm not a big angry writer because it always gets me thinking about things that make me mad or people who have angered me in the past. I'm going to try to avoid those people, as many of them don't realize they have done anything to me, so I don't think it's right for me to crucify them for it. What I need to do is just sit down with a close friend and just talk. I really need to do that to get a lot of things off of my chest. The only problem is that no one ever really wants to step up to being that person. Sometimes I even feel used by my friends, kinda like the person that no one really wants to hang out with one-on-one, but in a group it's a-ok! Like I'm a different person in a group than I am with only one person. I've got news for you, I am. It's a fact and I can admit it. Actually, I am a much better person when I'm with one person, mainly because I don't have to strive for attention because I know I am getting it no matter what. I am just who I am naturally in that situation, instead of being Mike ver. 2.0. Some people would probably be shocked to find out how naturally calm and relaxed I am, instead of a jumpy crazy kid. Sometimes I just wish I could be more like myself instead of who people want me to be. Oh well, that's more than enough for tonight's words of wisdom. Lets see if anyone actually responds to my comments, or if my blubbering goes unnoticed for yet another wasted week.
That was an odd five days. All started because Adam and I went job hunting and ended with Blaine's party. From Thursday thru Monday.  It's been a while since I've updated, but the server fucked up a little bit and it wouldn't let me log on. I have also been kinda busy. This is kind of random, but as a wrestling fan I have to say it. Randy Orton became the youngest champ ever! He is the man. Still don't have a new car, but soon I will. By the way, got some band info coming soon, as a new one is just over the horizon and it will finally be one that I can be proud of. S
