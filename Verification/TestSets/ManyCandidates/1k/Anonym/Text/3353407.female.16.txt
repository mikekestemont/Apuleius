just good to talk to someone within a few years of me. (by this time i'd already had plenty of the oh-so-loved family time and was ready to get back to my friends.)We hung out friday night and then saturday morning we went to the mall.  We were only suppose to be looking for shoes but she ended up getting a 3rd hole in her ear.  It's so not fair because her parents wouldn't even  notice.  But that took us an extra hour cuz she had to pick out some new jewelry and a new belly button ring.  Then we drove down to Captiva.  I was just happy that we had some time to hang out.  Captiva was pretty fun.  It felt like it lasted waaay more than 3 days but i was just anxious to get home.  We went to captiva to see all my dad's college buddies-who i call aunt or uncle, they're not related, just friends.  These guys were completely crazy-but they're fun to hang out with.  For pretty much the entire weekend all of them were drunk.  Its kind of sad because ALL of us had been drinking... but im proud to say that my parents were the most sober of all of the adults.  I got to have many a mudslides, magaritas, and dak-a-ries (can't spell) last weekend.  But the funniest thing of all was that the night before we came home all the adults went out to dinner-inturn dumping ALL the kids on me to babysit- and got really wasted.  My rents weren't drunk at all but they didn't trust themselves to drive back so they called me and my cousin ryan(he's also 16 and in my opinion looks just like bogan but more muscular) to come get them.  So it was kind of funny, kind of scary that me and ryan had to go get them but atleast they all made it back safely.  So Monday i wake up at 7 FL time -6 our time- and we went to the air port just to find that our first flight was delayed by about 3 hours.  We didn't get out of Ft myers until 1 or so.  Then because of our last delay we missed our flight from atlanta so we had to wait another 2 and a half hours just to get from atlanta to huntsville.  The day was not a good one.  We didn't get to huntsville until around 7.  To top it all off, the air lines lost my entire family's bags.  That made my dad sooooo mad.  He was suppose to leave yesterday morning-the morning after we got home- on a business trip and he needed his bag.  They finally found our bags and the air lines delivered them that night. Thats my vacation for you.  Im gonna write for tomorrow and today on another post because this one is getting really long.  Overall i had a really great vacation.  It makes me sad to think that i only have two more with my family before i leave for c
