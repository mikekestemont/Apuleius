a complaint is made, the FCC determines whether the incident was indecent."  There is a very real  urlLink possibility  that CBS will be fined upwards of $550,000 for Janet Jackson's Super Bowl Breast Escapade. So just the  urlLink FLASH  of her boob is deemed to be an indecent amount of sexual content, while the  urlLink Victoria's Secret Fashion Show  on the same network, which I think was billed as the "sexiest show on television" or something like that, was totally ignored by the FCC. hmmm.......  While we're talking about sexual content, let's read the  urlLink lyrics  of a song Janet sang earlier in the Super Bowl program. Little bit of sexual content? I'm thinking yes. But nobody's talking much about the indecency of that, are they? Or the fact that her boobie popped out while she and young JT were simulating a sexual assault? Nope. Nobody cares about that either. It would have been perfectly fine to subject kids to that. It's the ACTUAL NAKEDNESS that we find objectionable. nice message, American prudes.
Help. I think I'm hooked on  urlLink Charmed . Dammit. I can't even make the argument that it's got some other, deeper meaning like, say,  urlLink Buffy . No, Charmed is just another slightly-better-than-crappy escapist drama. They even recycle plots from things like  urlLink Ladyhawke , and the Harry Potter books. yeesh.
There are so many things about  urlLink this  that disturb me. A bunch of adults rolling around on the floor in their PJs? Why say no to kissing? And if these parties are relegated to the mentally and emotionally sound only, well, I guess there will be about three people in attendance.
Yesterday was my birthday. It was one of the lovliest ever and I thank everyone who shared it with me.  I like to think that every experience comes along to show us something, to bring us to become that people that we are. The last couple of years have been kind of rough, but I've learned that I'm a tough chick. I've also learned that there are miraculous things that happen in the world, that nothing brings me to breathlessness faster than the majesty of the ocean or seeing my little sister with her children. I hope this year and the many to come bring much much more.
My favorite weekend of the year approaches. Yes, it's  urlLink Decatur Celebration . Be sure to catch the Razzle Dazzle Goodtime Parade, either in person or on WAND-TV. There's nothing like watching a bunch of factory workers trying to wrangle gigantic Macy's-parade style balloons through the cramped streets of dowtown Decatur. And then there's the Shriner's giant bicycle. It's, well, a razzle dazzle good time. If that's not enough to entice you,  urlLink note  the great entertainment. Yes,  urlLink Gin Blossoms . Yes,  urlLink Los Straightjackets [sic]. Yes,  urlLink Presidents of the United States of America . But the one  I  will be sure to catch is  urlLink  The Black Diamond . An "unreal Neil experience" indeed. Bring your lawn chair and come early, because this guy packs em i
