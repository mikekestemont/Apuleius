running (not online though) with DNS, WEB, web-hosting services, SSH, FTP. That's all I can remember now. Been trying to config Sendmail now, but having no luck. Just won't work. I have planned a reinstall of slackware during the weekend, and I think I will upgrade from 9.0 to 9.1 or maybe 10.0 if I can download it. I just got a tip to try using Postfix instead.. Should be heaps easier to config and get up and running. Have to try that over the weekend... I'll be thrilled if I get it up and running. Been thinking of a server like this for ages. Thanks to all the people on #slackware who has helped me, and all the people taking the time to write tutorials for us newbies out there. When I get a little more elite, I'll write a few tuts myself. Both in Norwegian (my native tongue) and English.
Finally. I've had a chance to play with my server, and I've connected a small network at home. Late saturday night, I reinstalled Slackware 9.0 with only the bare essentials, and I started playing with DNS (BIND) and apache. I've set up apache before, so that wasn't the problem. Getting BIND to run, and VirtualHosts in apache was the pain. However some reading of a few norwegian tutorials, I fell back to a tutorial at  urlLink linuxhomenetworking.com   urlLink Chapter 6  is the exact location. This tutorial was great reading when I allready had read about DNS. If you've played with linux for a short while, and know the basics, this is the best tut I've found out there. They also have a lot more tuts on their site. The HOWTO and  urlLink tldp.org  written by Nicolai Langefeldt was to long, and contained much more info than what was really needed. That was only confusing. After fixing a few typos in the config files, BIND started and played like a charm. I changed httpd.conf to match my server name and other basic things. The next step was VirtualHosting. Everything was so simple when the basics was there. Now I have two domains running on my server. I'm not online with the server yet, but that will come. The next challenge is getting e-mail up and running for the domains. I'm using the Sendmail chapter from  urlLink linuxhomenetworking.com  Hope toget it all working soon.
I've revived a hobby of mine that I haven't cultivated for some time now. Photography.. I've even put up a section on my website  urlLink www.linuxboxonline.net  about photo. My linux-server at home is now awaiting my upgradeing to Slackware 10.0, but that might be a while. I find less and less time to "fiddle" with my server. I did manage to get some time to take photos the night before last. Nothing spectacular, but I hope I managed to cature the lightning-flash I encountered. If I did, I'll post it in my gallery when I get that up and running. I also post to  urlLink www.foto.no  and  urlLink www.photo.net  when I have pictures I'd like to have others v
