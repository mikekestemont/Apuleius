chin up.  That's the way.  One thing I need to learn, though, is how to walk into an office, or wherever, and tell whoever it may be, in a most polite manner, that I don't like them, I don't like what they're doing and for that reason I'm going and not coming back.  It's a true art, I'm sure.
I'll go in tomorrow morning.  That way I'm guaranteed to pick up my cheque, and I can hand back the security card.  Whether or not I do the rest of the week I can ponder on the train, or discuss when I get there.  To be honest, I don't think I will; I was expecting something rather different, perhaps being taught something interesting or being given some responsibility.  But perhaps that's too much to ask for an insignificant little 16-year old like me.  Age and qualifications matter so much.  Any qualification I get in the next 5 or 6 years would not help me with the business, and yet they don't trust me with anything.  I don't expect to funcion like a normal employee, because I havn't had the specific training, but I expect them to trust me, maybe even take an interest in what I have to say.  I can't name specifics, but I just wanted to be treated like an adult.  Nothing, and I mean nothing in this world infuriates me more than being treated like a child.  We saw that at the end of last term.  I may only be 16 years old, but I am an individual with my own opinions.  Patronising, that's what it is.  School, work experience, whatever.  Patronising.  Treat me like a teenager, expect me to act like one.  Expect me to be restless, easily bored and bad tempered.  Expect me to give up on things.  Don't expect me to sit in your beautifully furnished offices gawping about for 8 hours a day, dreaming about how when I grow up I'll work for your wonderful company.  Put me in a situation with nothing to lose, and I will happily go and lose nothing.  Why should i stay on next week?  For the sheer enjoyment of 5 more 10-hour days packed with thrilling nothingness?  I don't think so.  The only thing I lose by not going next week is possible future employment in the company.  And I decided earlier this week that I didn't want it thank you very much.  So I shall step aside, let some other poor lamb take my place or, if it is too late for that, relieve the lovely people at Man Group Plc of the burden that is me.  Because that is how they see me.  They are most happy when I am just sitting in the corner reading a book or the online news.  I can do that at home.  But at home I can also look at less reputable internet sites, get up later, practise kungfu, socialise.  This wonderful myriad of options.  As I have been so brutally reminded this week, I am still young.  I'm gonna enjoy i
