with. In a convenient slip-up, Rachel called Morgan "Jordan," and the guys got an inkling that she might know she's playing "FLOM." Morgan vaulted into the lead in lovin' as well as cash, and Chris was sent home.  LAST COMIC STANDING  (Tuesday and Thursday, 8 p.m., NBC 4) It was wild-card week, and the five booted contestants competed for the chance to get back in the game. No surprise that the underrated Bonnie McFarlane finished last and the unfunny Corey Holcomb was next to last. ANT was a disappointing third, and the one voted into the final six was ... Jay London? Well, if Carrot Top can have a career, we guess he can too.  BIG BROTHER  (Saturday, 9 p.m.; Tuesday, 9 p.m.; Thursday, 8 p.m.; CBS 10) We suspected Holly would be the Four Horsemen's Yoko Ono, and we looked more right than ever when Drew put Holly and Nakomis up for elimination.

Thus did city chick Meagan introduce "Amish in the City," the world's first Amishploitation show. Actually, this is probably one of the least exploitative reality shows, as the young Amish adults brought to Los Angeles to live with six city kids are going through their  rumspringa , a traditional coming-of-age period in which they experience the outside world and decide whether to return to the Amish life.
