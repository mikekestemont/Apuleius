Hey look, I'm a guy and I'm posting in a blog. Aren't I cool? Anyway, today is not a good day; in fact, it's it's the perfect  BAD  day.&nbsp; I got into a car accident. Before I tell you about that, I read my sweet hearts blog today and it seems I've been leaving her out a lot lately when my friend Ervey is on. I'm really sorry sweetie, I feel stupid and I take full blame, I should have payed more attention to you.  You guys, Dev is  incredible . Dev goes out and buys all this expensive stuff just to play with me on SOCOM II, a Playstation 2 game. It's like the sweetest thing anyone has  EVER  done for me; because she did it to play with me and spent a lot of money on it! I know she loves me and I love her too. You spoil me Dev!&nbsp;Dev dev, YOU are the greatest!  Okay, this morning sometime after Dev went to bed, I got on the couch and layed down. I quickly realized that this is how most of my accidental naps take place, so I got up and decided I will take my Dad's car for a "spin" to get used to driving that stick shift better, and mostly to drive fast. Boy was I in for an unexpected surprise.  >_  >_ Skip the bloody details and I'm okay, just scratches and a banged up head; and can't forget the fucked up car. This repeats in my head: I could have died. I'm sitting there shocked at what I have done, scared half to death of whether I heart myself bad enough to die, and whether I damaged the car enough to blow up, concidering it was on it's fucking side where the gas tank was. From my standpoint right now, as far as I am concerned, I don't ever want to drive again. I hate people, I don't trust them. I wish I could walk everywhere, but I can't, so I'll get over it, and drive later.. like much later. I'm afraid.  I love you Dev.&nbsp;I'm now glad I'm still alive, but I&nbsp;am still pressured. My parents are still gone on their week&nbsp;vacation thing to Reno,&nbsp;Nevada. They know, I called them. &nbsp;  By the way, if it means anything, I buckled up. [ Insert fake chuckle that I never really did, but might would have if I wasn't so pissed off ]  &nbsp;     &nbsp;   Until next time.. *
