to, how will this effect the drama? is bird two's bread lust be strong enough to fight his potential laziness? in short, i was fucking with these birds. i was starting conflict and sitting back to watch. hey...and...i was FEEDING them. they were hungry and i was just trying to help them out...and...hey stop looking at me that way.
so, yesterday, when i hit up the little convenience store hole-in-the-wall in the lobby of my building to buy smokes on my way home, i asked for my standard (as of late) camel lights (funny thing, my cigarette brand swings, this is my third switch this year. i went from camels to marlboro lights (i don't even like them, what was i thinking?) because they were like 15 cents cheaper and i was THAT poor, ok? and that madness lasted a year, and then to american spirits for a bit when i moved to sf, and now (thank god) back to camel lights.) and the lady told me they had either 100s (which are actually called 99s when camel makes them, because they are so innovative i can't stand it) or soft pack. although i have bought them several times under similar duress, i think the latter is just an asstastic idea. so let me get this straight...are these for the adventurous types who run with scissors? (i just paid 5 bucks for this pack of cigarettes and i like the dangerous feeling of the increased risk that they're all going to be crushed like a car at a junkyard. i live dangerously.), or the rich people? (i just paid 5 bucks for this pack of cigarettes, but if they get squooshed, i'll just by another one.) the dilemma in this case was not a dilemma at all, and like the sensible gal we all know me to be, i picked the "99s". the woman at the register rang it up: $4.95. right on...hand her a five...collect my changedoggies and go. i go out and light one up because i am the queen of instant gratification, and a thought hits me: i just got more cigarette for my money. the 100s are the same price as the regular cigarettes. the stirrings of a second thought played freeze tag in my head for an instant. considering that getting more always means paying more in every other instance i could think of, is it actually true that this is a chance to nickel-and-dime consumers that has been overlooked by cig big wigs? oh, shit, i hope nobody working for marlboro is reading this blog or there goes what may be the last outpost of non-assfuckery by corporate america.
