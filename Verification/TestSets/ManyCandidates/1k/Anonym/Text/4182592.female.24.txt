think that to apply knowledge management to an organization in this way would cost a fortune paid for designers. As a manager, I prefer to manage my own office in a way that doesn't cost too much and save money to the business. Money should work hard to make more money!  2. Slowness in personal relationships. I reckon it is important for us to nurture our relationship with others, to spend time and efforts on understanding their personalities, feelings and the like. According to a management guru, a successful manager is an interesting one who is interested in people. Then, slowness in our daily contact will make sure that we show our interestes in others, build the relationships stronger (which is a very essential skill: relationship-building) and more importantly, to gain more tacit/explicit knowledge that probably shared during our interactive. However, I still chew in mind one question that needs answering: What are the techniques to be effectively slow in relationships? Do we have enough attention to pay while we are working an extremely busy and stressful day?  3. Knowledge management is increasingly important in organizations. In other words, in future, managers will pay more attention on creating a learning organization.  4. 'Knowledage' questions. Victoria put forward a very interesting quesion on how to put questions and gain knowledge. I agree that people normally ask general questions, so why don't we change the questions to HOW yoo do it? With this way, I believe managers will get more knowledge/information beyond their expectation.  5. A small issue to think: how to make people to realize or value their experience and being share experience? I actually don't know.  REFERENCES  1. Drucker, P.

Today I have tried to finish a dish of vegetable which I normally don't like. I believe you are what you eat. So, I'm gonna look younger and heathier by taking in more greens.
