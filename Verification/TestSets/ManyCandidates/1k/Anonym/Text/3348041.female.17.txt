ok. life is shitty right now. and i think it's meant to be that way. its like people don't even realize i exist anymore. i'm getting quite tired of people not listening to me, or what's worse; acting like they are listening but then pass me and what i say as nothing. it makes me sad. oh well. what else is there to do but deal with it?  kill myself... yah right.  the pessimism in this room is suffocating. maybe i should open a window or something.
well, that's weird. who ever thought the title of one my blogs would be a Britney spears song.  but dude, i love this song.  i can't help it. I mean cmon, she dies in the video (kind of). but don't worry. i fixed it. i'm no longer listening to britney spears. yay afi.  but seriously, i feel like so much crap. that song is like exactly how i feel. i think i need to get it all out because i surely have not told anyone else.  JP and i broke up... kind of. it was initiated by me and i feel absolutely wretched about it.  well, i cheated on him with sam.  the guilt was just overwhelming and i couldn't deal with it.  i can't tell him that happened cuz it would hurt him more than anything. his old gf used to cheat on him all the time and i didn't mean for it to happen... but it did. and now im obviously a horrible person. we are just on a break right now, but it still hurts.  we've been apart for like 3 days and i miss him so much already. i really do love him alot. i hate not being together. i hate that i did that. if i tell him, he will never forgive me... i know it. and i dont know how to initiate our reconciliation. ironic... i had no problem initiating our estrangement.   and everytime i try to fly, i fall without my wings, i feel so small i guess i need you, baby and everytime i see you in my dreams i see your face, you're haunting me i guess i need you baby  ::sigh... i love JP
