 you guessed it right!  working overtime for saturday's features pages.  argh.  i don't know how i got stuck with staying five, six hours beyond my time doing advance pages.  i'm starving, haven't had dinner, although i have one of our "weekly rations" courtesy of a food joint specializing in home-cooked meals.  i'm starving but i still haven't eaten it.  don't know why.  i'm right now craving for a veneto's chicken cutlet parmigiana.  or friday's mushroom, chicken and mushrooms.  or that breaded thing mikko and i ate at bubba gump last monday when we met up with his ex-officemates.  oooh, my grumbling stomach!!!  i hope our plans on saturday push through.  i'm really looking forward spending time with the rest of the brats.  we have a lot of catching up to do.  i miss our deep, intimate, not-so-deep, sometimes far out but always frenzied conversations over dinner or while simply lounging around.  i miss laughing with them until our sides hurt and we all get teary-eyed from laughing so hard.  i miss fooling around with them.  i miss them.  i want to go home.  now.  i still have to wake up early.  we have badminton tomorrow morning, er, make that later at 10.  oooh, my grumbling stomach!!!

after, more or less, four years of constant use and abuse, our family's beloved monitor finally gave in.  it's so devastating.  really.  i was only then that i realized how much a rather big part of our lives revolve around the pc.  now we can't do anything else but sit in front of the tv.  hahaha.  and because i'm really, really, really short in funds and it is still five long days until the next payday and because i got a new discman recently (funny because it is, technically, my first ever--the other one's really mommy's, though i sort of claimed ownership of it--i could just imagine my seven-year-old kid's incredulous face when i tell him or her, "but, sweetie, mommy got her own discman at 23..."), i couldn't get a new monitor, as much as i want to.  it's so unfair, really, how other kids could, in a flash of daddy's or mommy's shining, shimmering credit card, indulge themselves in the most foolish of whims.  and then there are those kids who have to patiently and agonizingly wait for life's, errr, simplest necessities.  i know, i know, i'll shut up, i'm starting to get a bit trifling.  by the way, in case you're wondering how i was able to post an entry, i'm still in the office and a very kind soul let me use her internet a
