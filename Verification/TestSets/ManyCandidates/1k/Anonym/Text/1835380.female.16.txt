answer and voil√†! it's a rogers video representative or someone else from another company that i applied to, offering me an interview. damnit i need a job. anyway, maybe  i should stop complaining and have faith, i'll get one soon.    demo, you need to get recorded soon!!!    i need to get my demo recorded soon ( and i mean really soon ) so that an awesome  urlLink punk  band can say "baby stew we want you!". it's just so hard when you're as underprivileged as i am and dont have a mic and almost no one who is willing to help. there's so much i wanna do and i want to be in a band by the end of this month so i can organize a show this october...perhaps  urlLink the brat attack  or  urlLink arms to illustrate  and a few others would be interested...i dunno. maybe you don;t understand...this is my dream...maybe you're laughing at me because it's a far-fetched dream... i don't know how many people that are in bands can relate to me with what im about to say, but i feel so empty when i'm not making music. maybe im an addict. whatever it is, it's slowly grabbing hold of me and plunging its teeth into my face. and damn don't let anyone tell you that that doesn't hurt. cause it does!  i don't know what else to say...i've always had a problem articulating logically when i'm feeling so...so something. if you want me as a vocalist and live in the durham region, click  urlLink here .    love, stewey

i am still groggy from just recently grudging myself out of bed, so please excuse my lack of.... interestingness?  i spent the last few days in bowmanville visitng kate, whom i feel quite sorry for. she came down with the flu today, so i came home early. BOWMANVILLE HAS GOT TO BE THE MOST UNEVENTFUL SMALL TIME HICK TOWN EVER. i thought whitby was bad. i swear the coffee shops have tabs for their regulars. i wondered where all the teenagers were and regretted looking for them because they were all so freaking ugly. and when we arrived at the movie theatre sunday night, kate and i hit the "jackpot" of 13-21 year olds. but finding the cash wasn't that rewarding anyway because they were ugly also, and most of them were staring at me and considered me an outsider. excuse me if i raised your village's population to 5001. the worst part: i am moving to the town beside bowmanville, newcastle, which is considered quite boring and uneventful by bowmanvillers.
