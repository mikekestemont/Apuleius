fade away
please don't ever change
please don't change your mind
no matter what they say
i'll always wait
and as days go by, the memories remain
i'll wait for you
and as days go by, the memories remain
i won't let go
these days remain the same
pictures fade away
i hope you never fade
as you drip through my veins
shine on, shine on diamond eyes
shine on, shine on diamond eyes
shine on, shine on diamond eyes
and as days go by, the memories remain
i'll wait for you
as days go by i swear i'll try
(i'll wait for you) until i die, anything for you
[to fade]
well its been an odd start to my yrip. while we were on the road we were stuck in traffic on the freeway for an hour because there was an awful wreck! soem people died. and then i find out that constitine(sp?) bryces car is broken forever! i loved that car so much. oh well. so i guess bryce and angela drank beers and watched porn together last night. hmm. that sounds odd. and it is. wow. he tells me he wont drink without me and he does, but angela says that he was stressed so i guess its okay. its kind of like i was at his house when he was gone and dring beer and watching porn with anthonie..i mean its just odd and im kind of weirded out by it. i trust both of them but i just am a little sad about it. well im done whining to whomever is reading this.
god i suck ass. so today was so fucking great. i mean doing jack shit in summer school, falling asleep in the arms of my bryce, playing video games with friends... need i say more but then i just had to screw it up. its like something was tempting me to, taunting me, ya know. so i did i got hella fucking stressed. bryce pulled me into the other room and i broke down. it sucked. just looking into his eyes, i could see that i had screwed things up. he looked so hurt. i just couldnt stop crying and then when i finally calmed down i just looked into his eyes and saw how upset he looked and i got more stressed out. he just kind of shrugged it off like it was no big thing but i could tell that he was extremely hurt. why the hell do i always turn good things bad? its just a curse i guess. damn i hate myself. i hate the way i make bryce feel when i do shit like this. he doesnt deserve it, but he puts up with it. i dont get it. i love him so much. the last thing i want is to screw things up with the one i love. im trying hard to stop stressing so much and i guess it will all be good in due time. why cant that time come sooner? i just loved being in his arms. i felt so safe and so loved. i wish i could just lay there forever, wraped up in h
