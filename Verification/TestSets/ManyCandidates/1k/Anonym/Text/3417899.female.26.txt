of her fantasies, posts links to her favorite pornographic stories and material, etc. In her latest post, she had written an eloquent piece about how women occasionally like to be "taken", more forcefully conquered, without necessarily playing the whole sentimental game. I thought it was well put, and quite true, and was careless enough (as usual) to post a comment. My simple comment ("Hear, hear") is not the careless part, it was the fact I signed with my blog address that was careless.   Ever since (It's been a few days) I have been getting hundreds of hits on my blog, from people who clicked on that comment. (Once again, I know this courtesy of  urlLink Blogpatrol ).  Well, my fellow porn lovers, I am sorry to disappoint you, but this  not  a pornographic blog... Despite what my comment may have led you to think. At least it isn't  yet ... ;-)
I've recently discovered  urlLink blogpatrol  which allows me to see the IP addresses of the people visiting my site, (as well as the referrers they come from, but more on that later). Then I discovered that with the IP address, I can find out the actual location (City, State, Country) of my visitors. (Yes, it is kind of Big-brother-is-watching-scary).  I was pleased (and surprised) to see people from all over the world hitting my blog: Germany, UK, Italy, Spain, south Africa, Canada, Singapore, and obviously USA.  So far, so good.  But a few days ago I noticed someone from Brooklyn has been reading my blog. When I saw this is a returning reader, my heart missed a bit.  I had just finished reading this  urlLink confession of a fellow blogger , in which she tells the world her Mom reads her blog. Notice my comments... (Recap: I would die if my family read my blog).  Well, my father and uncle's family are in Brooklyn. Are they reading it???   Paranoia is taking over me.    So - here is my plea: If you are my Brooklyn reader, and my sanity means anything to you, please post a short comment letting me know you are not my dad, uncle or relative.  Please . You can post anonymously, of course.   And if you, dear Brooklyn reader, are a family member as I fear: then I deeply apologize if my musings offended you in any way, shape or form.  urlLink Who said our family was normal ?
In reading  urlLink this article,  I didn't know whether to laugh this off as another weird patent, or to be in awe of what could, potentially, be a huge new invention.   In late June, the U.S. Patent Office took the idea seriously enough to award Microsoft patent number 6,754,472&#8212;titled "method and apparatus for transmitting power and data using the human body."  Can you imagine?  Transferring files to each other while holding hands... or making out... ?  Electrocuting your baby while she's breast-feeding?   Hmmm....
