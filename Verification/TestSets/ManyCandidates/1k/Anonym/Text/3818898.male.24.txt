anymore. So why do I care so much and why is it so hard for me to let go? Anyways, it's kind of a shitty thing that i must go through; What a fucked up situation to be in. I have become so reclusive. I do not want to think of another girl at this time and she is already seeing people. On top if it all, she tells me that she loves every second of it. Shitty.  It seems to me that when it rains, it pours. I am doing my best to keep my chin up and my feet moving, but I still miss her. I really want to talk with someone who cares for me about these things, but the emptyness inside me consumes my motivation to go out. Sooner or later, this pain will die. I will fill in the holes during a series of my future posts.
This is my first entry into this blog website. I have been through alot these last few weeks. I have started to keep a journal on my laptop, but I will begin to transfer everything to this website in the form of future posts. I will attempt to keep a daily listing of the daily events of my life as well as my feelings and expressions. I hope any readers of this blog (if any at all) can relate and hopefully take something away with them as I discuss my life. If you ever feel the need or would like to comment, reply or give advice, please do not hesitate to do so.    I suppose the proper initial entry should be used to introduce myself. My name is Lucas. I am 24 and just graduated from California State University in Fullerton. I am a good looking, white, middle-class guy raised in the suburbs of Southern California. I recently obtained a job/potential career at a small financial planning firm in Orange County. I will be a Financial Planner/Advisor; and a good one at that. As you will probably notice if you continue to read my entries over time, I am a stand-up, honest, and trustworthy individual. I am Christian but do not practice (or should I say go to church) on a regular basis. But that has no effect on the faith I have in God. For the most part, I am your typical guy. I am not a partier, bad-boy, choir-boy, hoodlum, gangster, asshole, etc... I am recently single (against my will). My ex-girlfriend, Kelly, broke up with me two weeks before my graduation to date other people. I will comment more on that in the future. That has been a large portion of my life these past few weeks. To be quite honest, my heart has been broken and I am struggling to regain control of my life.  This will be the end of the first post. For those who read this, those I know or don't know, there will be more to come and I hope everyone has an opportunity to enrich themselves and myself through these p
