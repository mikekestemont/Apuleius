the job hunt, I'm interviewing with "The Director" at the JCC on Tuesday, and with the really nice guy for the PT Admin on Wednesday. The best scenario is getting both positions, but I'd happily settle for one. There are no other options. Larrett's sister is coming down tomorrow for a week, that could be very interesting. Lastly, just for a chuckle...
•Mood: cheerful       •Music: Something Corporate - Ruthless   I'm Prince! I changed my ebay username to a symbol. I really need to list a ton of crap, it's just such an effort, particularly with clothes. What am I whining about?! I'm in no position to be too lazy to create income! I gotta get outta this city. It's pointless to stay. The cheapness involved in living here is such a shackle, going to practically any other city means a drop in standard of living. However, I don't care anymore! It's not worth it at  all . How anyone can be a Phoenix lifer is beyond me--save yourselves! get the hell out while there's still time! before getting entrenched! I woke up this morning and thought, I'm going to use exclamation points today like they're going out of style!
•Mood: full       •Music: Sigur Ros - Njosnavelin (Nothing Song)   I'm not a fan of her style, but if there's a winner of this Monopoly game we live, it's Oprah, and you have to respect her for it. After all, someone like Bill Gates essentially started the game with more than the standard $1500, quite a bit more in fact. Oprah, on the other hand, figuratively began as a debtor, and now she determines what's on the New York Times bestseller list. That's quite an accomplishment.
•Mood: blah       •Music: Alphaville - Forever Young   If you see a small perfectly opaque balloon from a few feet away, there's really no telling what's in it. I suppose you could eliminate the possibility of helium if it wasn't bobbing upright, but otherwise, it could be pudding, water, shit, a deck of cards, or it could be...nothing. I'm a nothing balloon. I tend to fool people who only see me from a distance, they assume I'm filled with something good, like pudding. I retain power by never letting them get close enough to discover that I'm absolutely empty.   I used to think I had all the answers, and it was comforting to know that. But did I really believe it deep down? Maybe I did, for a while. I'm not sure though, I don't think I remember the past very accurately when it comes to how I felt. I can associate joy and misery with individual events; but I don't really recall what the baseline was, it's all a haze, merely marked in spots by those specific events. How do people find a point or a purpose without religion? Suicide rates are higher in industrialized nations--we have the time to think about this kind of crap, and we're also forced to participate in capitalism. Money, love, consumerism, procreation, can this be all there i
