not analyzing our realtionship and every move we make. I think that thinking has made me forget to feel... at least a little bit. Sure, I understand the passion and actually analyzing everything has made everything seem more passionate becasue I've relived each moment over and over again while writing about it. I think maybe it blinded me to where we were headed. I love you, you know that. And I always will love you. I can actually see myself growing up and still loving you, still being with you, maybe even marrying you and having a family someday. But that's a long long way off and if we don't slow down... God, I don't know what's going to happen, but we're going to be in some deep shit sooner or later. I know you've said that this is fast. I know it's fun, very enjoyable but that's the problem: It is so enjoyable that we're liable to end up going much further than we know we should. I trust you but you and I both know that you're only human and only male and you can lose control sometimes. And we both know that we can't count on me to stop it. I love you and I trust you within an inch of my life but I want to put more security there we that if you can't maintain control and I don't stop you; so that we won't go too far. Of course no one's ever 100% secure but we need some kind of limit, obviously. There's been many a time when we could have done way more than we did, thank God. I don't know what we can do to put limits, to give us some security but we need it. If you can think of anything... please tell me. Jsut know that I love you and I always will.
GO TO GAIA!!
I'm posting, really with nothing to say. Otherthan I like how the Streaking Guild's "E'rebody in the Club gettin' TiPsY XD!" shows up in the URL. Random, I know.   And today my Granny came over and she's still here: Cleaning. Even though she knows she doesn't need to clean. Our house is clean. And she has breathing problems that I can't spell here and she's using chemicals. She's folding clothes... my clothes... my underwear that's jsut going to get crumpled up into a drawer anyway. Who folds underwear? I can understand folding things like shirts and jeans and maybe even bundling socks together but not folding underwear. And the things is when she folds my underwear she always has to comment about it. "Kell?! Kell!? You really should throw this pair out. It's too thin here." or "Kell!?! Where are you? When you folded these clothes you didn't fold your underwear. Come back and do it right." So who folds underwear? Grannys fold underwear. I wonder if she fold her own underwear before she puts it in drawers at home... She probably does, as if anyone can see if your underwear has a wrinkle in it... *
