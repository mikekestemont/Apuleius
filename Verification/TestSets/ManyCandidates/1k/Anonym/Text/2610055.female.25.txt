we wait to die.  Painting, writing, looking out the window and thinking, are more directly involved in life by their freedom of will-power.   Life  to me is experience.  But if what I'm experiencing is programmed by someone else, it seems like a dirrivative (second-order) experience from someone else's direct (first-hand) experience.  It is the first-hand experiences that I'm really looking for.  I don't want to just wait around for something to happen.   I  want to happen!
I have three blogs that I now have to be clever for...I don't think I have that much cleverness to go around. but we'll soon find out just how clever clever is!!!  so this band thing is really takeing off eh? Some of our friends are trying to get i on the band action, which is cool! but...you shouldn't be like "hey, alisha said I could be in your band is that cool"...when in fact alisha said nooooo such thing.like...dude start your own electro-raunch band and stop trying to hone in on our talents for writing great songs!!!!  heh...you know who you are!
stacey! i thought it would be cool to have a communal blog where we could post together. in fact, we should get other people in on it too. or maybe it can just be for our band and for us. i don't know. but communal blogs rock. what do ya say?
so...we on way back into the "studio" (meaning alisha's room) to rerecord some of our songs we didn't really like the first time around...such as it's so hard..and pornado. pornado will be a lot thesame with the same words and the same beat...hopefully, but will just be better. it's strange to me that people we know sorta but not really have been checking out our.  we had a guy we sorta know through school/friends (we both know him throught different people) came u[p to us and was like I really liked pornado!..that felt cool  it felt like that for one qucik second in time I was famous......  nah it was actually kinda weird and creepy that someone we didn't really know knew who we were. well I was creeped out anyway.  but it's back to the note books for me to start on some lyrics for some new songs. we need to get ths party started!!   w00t
so, we've been doing a lot of  recording ourselves being silly to regular beatas these past few weeks. It's been fun and some of it I think we're going to put as a hidden song at the end of our first album. we sing silly songs and make fun of each other and our friends. it's good times.  that's about it really. I think I might go over to alisha's house to rerecord some old songs that we don't really like that much. for example,...pornado can be sooo much better!!!
we are gonna be superstars, and this new song is proof.
NEW SONG!!! NEW SONG!!!  GO TO OUR PAGE AND CHECK THIS SHIT OUT!!!!! no, really go...it's our best song ever..you thought we were good before..now we're hot!!!!  urlLink C
