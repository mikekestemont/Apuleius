was the back of the necks of some soldiers and a bright light. When some farmers were interviewed about a 'landing', they all came up with different information. The army came in to dig up whatever was on the metal detector; it was a small chunk of iron, which can be found anywhere.
Did NASA con the world?   Did NASA con the world about the landing on the moon? The photos are certainly fakes, with wind, shadows & no stars. So should Armstrong really be famous? Find out next Wednesday at 9pm on C5. I definitely wont miss it.
Vote us out of the EU   I caught the last few minutes of the BBC news, where they wanted us to vote ourselves out of the EU. I didn't catch any of the arguments but made a few of my own. I, for a start, am strongly against the euro (partly because I hate frogs), but mostly because I am proud to be British and love the Pound. It is one of the srongest currencies in the world and I think that both the EU and America want Britain to join their currency; because if we did, it would be by far the strongest currency. To be safe from the Euro, we must leave the EU. We don't need the EU. There is a higher rate of unemployment within the EU than out of it. Not only will we be safe from the Euro, but we will be able to be a seperate country, have our own laws...

Exams   Today I had my first proper exam day. Previously I have only had Art and English litterature. Today I had Geography in the morning, One hour of sunbathing, half an hour of football, an hour of sitting around talking (in the sun) and then a Biology exam. I finished both exams in good time, which I am rather pleased about. But why is it that even when I finish the paper, I still manage to get a bad mark?
I can't believe that stupid Swiss referee disallowed Campbell's goal. England beat Portugal in the match last night, and the w***** took it on to extra time and penalties. But I would like to congratulate Portugal. They scored two very good goals, and the goal keeper played very well.
