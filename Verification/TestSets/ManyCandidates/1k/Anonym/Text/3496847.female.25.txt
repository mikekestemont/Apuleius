studying.  I'm also going to start watching some French TV.
I have not had any luck this weekend.    Wednesday, just before 5, I got my finger caught in the safe at work.  It hurt - a lot.  I'm still surprised that I didn't cry and/or curse.  I have a pretty high tolerence for pain.  I'll make a show of it, curse and complain, but I can handle it pretty well.  I've broken bones and had things pierced and been okay.    So I got my finger jammed, freed it and ran to the kitchen to put it in cold water.  Under the nail had turned pruple immediately.  A co-worker ran and got me ice.  It wasn't broken so I went home, taking the ice pack on the subway with me.  I woke up Thursday and it hurt more.  It was swollen, the purple under the nail had expanded and turned black.  I spent Thursday in pain, and advil wasn't doing anything.  Friday my finger was even worse.  It throbbed.  I had to keep it elevated and if anything touched it I was near tears.  I went to the dentist for impressions of my crown.  The freezing wore off before he was done working.  More pain, just what I needed.  I then visited a friend, walked around TO to try and get my mind off my finger and picked up a few things at Wal-mart.  I walked from the Eaton Centre to Bay & Bloor and then around the U of T campus for a bit.  My mind never forgot about my finger and then I was tired and cranky.  I took a cab home from Wal-mart.  I tried to change my clothes once I was home and when I was taking off my shirt it touched my finger and it hurt - I was in tears and had to sit down.    So I went to the clinic.  I knew what had to be done to get rid of the pain, but it didn't sound like fun.  The doctor needed to drill a hole in my nail and let it bleed to relieve the pressure.  He held my hand down - I was lying down thank goodness, held my finger tight (pain) and started to dig a little whole with a needle (more pain).  He got through the nail (lots and lots of pain) and started to squeeze my finger to force the blood out (pain).  After about two squeezes I could feel the pressure letting up.  He spent about five minutes squeezing my finger.  He kept saying that I should of come in sooner, and that this is a terrible pain to endure for two days.  If the pressure comes back then I hould go to a clinic right away.  I promised I would - and I will if necessary, it hurt while he was doing it, but I'm much better today then I was yesterday.    My finger hurt all night from the squeezing, but I slept like a log and woke up in less pain.  Typing hurts, so that's it for n
