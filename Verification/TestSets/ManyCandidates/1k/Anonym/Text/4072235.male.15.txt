their return. Because of their exile from FM, they're switching to satellite. Now its not that much money, u don't need to take out a fucking second mortgage for 13 bucks a month, but I am a Jew... hope I can get the episodes commercial free of bit torrent.  Alright thanks for listening to me rant kiddies, and good night.
As a general rule of thumb I do not attend anything with my family involved unless i absolutely have to. It isn’t that I don’t like my relatives, although I do despise them, it’s the fact that I am sick and tired of watching old people complain. (ie my aging relatives bitching about those infernal horseless carriages, while simultaneously making sure their depends haven’t been filled with brown goodness yet, to celebrate my great uncle's birthday.) Not to exaggerate how terrible it really is, there are other elements to these events other than a constant state of whining. How could I forget the sugar free, carb free, fat free, taste free cake they'll serve later.  in the event that something like this does come up, i attempt to come up with a medical excuse (But mom, that tramp from last night gave me crabs) not to be there.

As I examined my terrible pasty white skin, I realized that damn near a third of the beach had skin whiter than me. And this is quite a fuckin accomplishment. I have Casper the friendly ghost just snorted a line of coke before taking a load of man juice to the face-white skin. An albino compared to me is a Rio de Janeiro beach babe. The people on this beach were just ridiculously white. I just thought of the poor artist who would have to paint this scene. “No sir, no other colors. Four ten gallon drums of white. No, not tan. White. A light pink will never work, white. No sir, definitely not a light peach. White!”  Other than that absolutely nothing happened. A complete waste of a perfectly good day. O yeah, I had to retell my trip to Europe 5 million fuckin times. By the time I finished my 53rd retelling of my London hotel room, my throat hurt more than a girl’s from d
