Alrighty, well.. those should keep you occupied for a while. Tata for now.
So... this blog thing isn't going too well for me. I'm all like "yeah.. I should do an entry" but then I don't. I guess I just have to start getting in the habit. So anyways, these past two weeks have been awesome! First I had Girl's Camp, and then I got back from EFY Saturday. Both were way fun and way spiritual. I really wish I could feel what I felt there everyday of my life. I don't know, they both put a lot of things in my life into perspective, about what really matters. In addition to the spiritual aspects of both weeks, I was able to meet a bunch of AWESOME people. My props go to Eva, Jessica, other Jessica, even another Jessica, and Ryan. You guys are awesome! My EFY group's name was Beware of Dogs. and we won the cheer! whooptie! our name wasn't as cool as Katie ( urlLink http://katiedidnt.blogspot.com/ ) and Steven's though.. Bowels of Mercy. Their cheer made me want to crap my pants.. literally. (gross!)   Hmm.. so much happened it's hard for me figure what I should and shouldn't talk about. The classes at EFY were awesome and I learned a ton. My family wanted me to share what I learned during them, last night. And, I talked for like 45 minutes just on the spiritual aspects of Tuesday, then they got bored. I guess that puts into perspective to all of you reading this how much I truly learned-- to be able to talk that much about 3 50 min. classes.    So, Wednesday I get to fly in a plane for the first time (yeah, don't laugh at me)... which should be cool. We're going out to Oregon for a family reunion. I haven't seen that side of my family since I was a year old. So, it should be interesting. BUT! I get to see my brother Drew, and his wife Steph, and their two adorable girls Kimmi (almost 4) and Alli (almost 2). Yeah, I haven't seen them for almost a year and a half. And then, after we get home, they're flying out here... So, I get to be the aunt every day! :-D They're beautiful. I'll try and post some pics on here sometime. Anyway, I better go to sleep. I'm working out early in the morning with Laurie (yay! go me! ) Love ya'll (or as ryan would say.. 'WUBZ!') Megs    Ryan: ...I told you my parents were old   His dad: What'd you say?   Ryan: I said, aren't my parents young whipper s
