love and more...
Have you ever spilled a package of dried capellini on the kitchen floor? You have no idea how difficult it is to pick it up. How on earth I found playing pick-up-sticks as a child is beyond me. Thoughts on Biology - what does knowing about glycolosis, the Kreb's cycle, and the electron transport system have anything to do with my life. I'm so grateful that my cells are respirating, but let's just leave it at that. Prince rocks. I'm still awed by his talent. How many years of being a fan and I'm still completely enraptured by his music. If I were to be on a desert island, I shall take with me for sure "When U Were Mine", "Joy in Repetition", "Anna Stesia", and "Sometimes it Snows in April". And thinking of these songs makes me miss Kenny Wilson even more so. I'm not going to have those deep conversations of His Royal Baddness' LoveSexy philosopy with him again - "Have U had Ur plus sign 2day?" So, I shall continue to funk in his honor, much the same way that I spin in honor of Billy Limbo. Peace, Q

Well, here we go - Quinn C. joins the blog generation. I have no idea what musings I will be posting up here, but it seems fitting that I have a place on the info-superhighway to present my musings and ramblings and inspirations and creations. But now, it's time for bed. Namaste, Q
I have had numerous folk this week comment on how ducky it is that I have this blog. However, I had one comment that there was no recent posting placed upon the site for anyone's perusal! So, I submit this in an ongoing quest to keep the ball rolling and try to put something up at least once a week if not more. This evening, I have been asked to spin at this party in the Valley where I have been asked to play a variety of RnB tunes before the guests are whisked away to the Al Green concert at the Greek Theater. The first level of joy in this process is in pulling records and CDs to play. Going through my tunes, just the mere sight of titles gets me all warm inside. Here's a list of some of the classics that I have glanced at that really lit me up: Lovely Day - Bill Withers Rock Steady - Aretha Franklin I Don't Want to Lose Your Love - The Emotions Running Away - Roy Ayers Was That All It Was - Jean Carne I Want You Back - Jackson Five Love's Theme - Love Unlimited Orchestra Oh Happy Day - Edwin Hawkins Singers (ok, this is gospel, but it makes me very happy!) Clouds - Chaka Khan You Are My Friend - Patti LaBelle Move On Up - Curtis Mayfield Ah...They just speak for themselves, better than I can try to put down in words. And especially in anticipation of their delivery on a warm Summer afternoon in Los A
