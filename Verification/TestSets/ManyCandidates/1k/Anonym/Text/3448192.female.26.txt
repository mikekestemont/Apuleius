way to bring Loobz here and he did, about two hours later. He called me on the phone saying, "Yah lor, my friend Ah-Boy got problem ah! I go Loyang first ah. Wah lau eh, kan ni nah si bei pwobwem ah!"  I scolded him on the phone. He was supposed to bring Loobz here, not save his friend from a gang fight in Loyang (he's a pseudo cop)! All upset, I told Bobo this. Her eyes lit up and she said "He's coming! Everyone, he's coming!"  I was confused then I remembered... 'gang fight' in 'LOYANG' - that's where WE are! I couldn't believe that I was SOOOOOOO...... distracted.  Ahem.  So the surprise really turned out well for him, you could see it in his eyes when he arrived, all ready for a showdown with some people to see us instead, of all people.   We ate a lot, I ate four times and we all drank. Mummy didn't scold us, she just said Loobz should drink slower as he turns red easily (!?).  We played street soccer and our team won 10-7.
Going to bed at 7-something a.m. just makes you want to stay in bed forever.   So at 5.30pm, I woke up. Couldn't remain under the duvet like that - I've got spas to edit.   While Jelts spruced up the battleground of the previous debauchery, I drank milk and chain-smoked in front of the PC, working. At 8, we left for Shazam's. Met up the crew plus Sandra's sister, Celine, for the first time.   Dinner at Kiruya Dining was really good. I mean the food had always been so but where we sat, at this warehouse-looking smoking-enabled area, felt like we were somewhere else, not a shopping mall restaurant.   The plan was to boogie at INK after dinner but Jelts was feeling a little fragile. I didn't mind either way so I volunteered to take him home. As if I would have it any other way.  He's mine!  I get to take him back with me!  Finished Back to the Future 2 and I fell promptly asleep at  the beginning of number 3...
Called Yvonne in the afternoon to tell her that I couldnâ€™t go to her Cosmo party tonight. Been nursing an infected eye. I am now re-enacting my school years with my geeky look No. 1.  I was also too disorganised to dress up on that Friday.  I was in the office till 9pm. Met Jelts up at the cow for a gratifying ale after work and that quickly became like eight or nine (I actually tried to count). Shazam came through later. Eric was supposed to come at first at 7pm. Then it became 10.30pm, then at last we met him after midnight. By the time Sandra arrived afterwards, we decided to go home. By then we were suffering from alcoholic/ toxic poisoning. Off our postal codes. Big John and Mann turned up at a later time. I joined Jelts in kissing the ceramic throne on more than one occasion. We had guests till around 7am.  Blasting n
