of us with our knowledge with the programs, as we are her assistants in a way. We help her out in class with other students needing help with the class assignment.  Last week we took our Microsoft Word Exam and got an "A". The Exam consisted of 50 questions open book and got to pair up with a partner (so yes my hubby was my partner).  Tuesday in medical law and ethics/therapeutic communications we had our first test and I missed two (which wasn't bad for not really getting a chance to study much for it). Medical Law and Ethics terminology is so much to know, but thank goodness the instructor isn't to worried about it right now, but said he will help us know them later. Therapeutic Communication I actually enjoy learning the most. I find that class more interesting and fun for me. I am behind on my weekly articles for both subjects and need to hurry up and catch up.  Wednesday in A&P II last week, we went over the blood and the heart. The blood confused me, but the heart I picked up pretty easily, surprisingly with heart being so detailed with all the atrias, ventricles, muscles, and how the blood flows through the heart. Tonight I have 2 tests to take and they are over last weeks lectures. I honestly haven't had time to study both of them and seriously need to today. So I hope I do ok tonight on the two tests.  Thursday in english composition II we went over compare and contrast. The instructor had us watch two different versions of Romeo and Juliet. Did I understand what they were saying No LOL :)  I decided to do my compare and contrast over my mother and I. She and I are so much alike but yet so very different. It was amazing what I came up with, it's like the old saying goes, opposites attract LOL :)  Don't get me wrong, I love the relationship and cherish deeply the relationship that my mother and I have. I would not trade it for anything and she knows that. When she called me over the weekend, I told her I was doing this essay and she just laughed with me at our differences :)  The rough draft is due tomorrow and I haven't even started writing it :( And it has to be 1500 to 1800 words, that's 5 to 7 pages long.  So hopefully I can get it done tomorrow, as I have to drive my husband into work tomorrow morning just so I can take my kids to school and then pick them up and pick him up so we can go to school tomorrow night. Boy am I going to be exhausted. My other car is still out of commission, but hopefully will get fixed this weekend (at least it better LOL).  But that is my update for this week anyways LOL :)  Got to finish getting things ready for the kids tomorrow and start studying. Will update next week :)  T
