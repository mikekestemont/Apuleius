I quit my job and went on leave for the last week of July. What bliss! I had the opportunity to go to Knysna for a few days with friends - we stayed in the cutest little lodge in the Goukamma Nature Reserve. Our view was a beautiful little vlei, with geese, red-knobbed coots and even a blue heron! And don't forget the bokkie - we called it our one-bokkie welcoming committee!  When Jen started talking about all the lovely hikes that we could go on, I felt my heart sink into my boots! But after a bit of arm-twisting I found myself on a boat crossing the Goukamma river with a pulley system! And then our 8km fynbos hike began. It was tough, but exhilirating. Lots of sandy uphills (with stunning views of the reserve, the river and the sea!) and downhills. Eventually we made it to the beach - and also halfway mark of this particular circular route - where we had a picnic.  A cucumber and tuna sandwich never tasted so yummy delicious - ever!  Then we were off again, this time through fairy forest. They were sleeping though, since it was daytime. Fairies are night creatures, you know. We did see a vervet monkey.  When we returned to the lodge, we actually had a "middag slapie". We were just bushed (no pun intended)!   Knysna, as it turned out, needed a bit of red paint, and we obliged willingly. Had the most awesome prawns, wine - and a weird drink of port and brandy! (Our dinner neighbours chatted up Jen. As it turned out, they were from England. And,yup, you guessed it, the port and brandy concoction was their idea! It was actually quite pleasant, especially on a cold Knysna evening.)    Luckily, day two brought showers, so we couldn't go on another hike. Instead we did a bit of shopping in Knysna, got soaked, ate and then we met Fransje van Riel and Gareth Patterson, the lion dude. See link below. We had such a fantastic time with them and their four cats and three dogs. http://www.garethpatterson.com  Day three was sunny, so we headed off to Buffel's Bay and decided to walk the 12km to Brenton on Sea along the beach. Fantastic! I picked up loads of pretty shells, peed in the wild, and saw whales!  After that, we went canoeing on the gentle Goukamma river. Ahhh. We floated past a cow having a sip of water. It was very cute! Moo!  Sadly, we had to say goodbye the vlei and the birdies the next day and take the long road back to Cape Town. Did miss my kitties immensely and was glad to be back home. This was one of the best holidays ever.  A good, refreshed way to start a new job, which I did on Monday, 2 August! Loving it, by the w
