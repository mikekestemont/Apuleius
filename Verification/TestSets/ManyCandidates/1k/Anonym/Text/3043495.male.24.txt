that we hung out with them pretty regularly.  Was that clear? I think writing up these stories will be a good exercise in writing clearly and concisely, because things can get pretty complicated quickly and you don't want to clutter things up with too many unnecessary details, but you also need to flesh things out enough to make them interesting.
I have a lot of small world stories, so I thought it'd be fun to write them up from time to time and post them here to share. I'm thinking of letting other people submit their stories, too.
It's been over a month, so I figure a post is long overdue.  Summer of 2002 I was in DC interning for the  urlLink Institute for Policy Studies . One of the other interns, Mike, had to call up a bunch of people in Mexico, and maybe elsewhere in Latin America, to see if they could come to some conference or something. I heard him talking on the phone in Spanish while I was doing work in the intern office (which was generally overcrowded, so I tried to work from home when I could).  That fall I started a year with the  urlLink Lutheran Volunteer Corps  (LVC). In January I started volunteering at the  urlLink DC Employment Justice Center  where another LVCer was working. I did Spanish language intakes at their workers rights clinics. I liked doing some direct service (while I loved my placement  urlLink Quest for Peace , I was doing advocacy work that often felt pretty removed from the people I was trying to help), it was good Spanish practice, and I also had an ulterior motive.  Anyhow, one evening I'm at clinic and I can hear this gringo speaking to a client in Spanish. I can't see him because he's doing the intake in a cubicle. I'm like, I recognize that voice and accent. It was Mike. It was cool to bump into him and see him at clinics and we even did an intake together.  So far it's only a mid-level small world story, if that. Peace and justice people get around and our circles are smaller than they ought to be, so it's only natural that we bump into each other from time to time. But it gets better... You see, Mike went to Williams. I knew a guy in Alaska named Jason C. who went to Williams. In elementary school we were in the same "gifted" program. I moved to California when I was 12, but he was good friends with my two best friends in Alaska, Geoff and Jason S, with whom I kept in touch. I saw him the summer before college when I was visiting my dad (who still lives there). So I ask Mike if he knows him. Williams is a small school and they were the same year, so it's no big surprise that they do. They don't just know each other, they're good friends. They both did crew and rowed together  in the same boat.     And that makes the story worth w
