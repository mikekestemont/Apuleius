King Rat. The imagination of Michael Moorcock, author of more than eighty books, has fathered two of the most significant figures in fantasy writing: Jerry Cornelius and Elric. Geoff Ryman is the author of Was and the bestseller 253, among other books.
My thoughts: The book was incredible. A great collection of stories by authors new to me. I did have some questions on the third story like; What is the point? Where is this story going? Why did anyone bother putting this in such a good anthology?
Over all I think anyone comming into the genre of Science Fiction and Fantasy should read this book. It is a classic example of the talent and worlds/characters a reader can find in the Sci-Fantasy genre can find.   READ IT!!

From book cover: Martians invade Great Britain, laying waste to turn-of-the-century London. This tale of conquest by superior beings with superadvanced technology is so nightmarishly real that an adaptation by Orson Welles and the Mercury Theatre on the Air sent hundreds of impressionable listeners into panicked flight forty years after the story's original publication.
My thoughts:  H.G. Wells uses a character that is by far too removed from his emotions and the events that take place right in front of his face. While Wells writes a compelling story, he should have told this story from a third person point of view, and even proves this with his shifting to another characters perspective almost forgetting the original character.
He by far, did a wonderful job of creating a story that feels plausible and strikes fear into the hearts of the readers, even if the dates are long past. It is incredibly smoothly written, even when jumping from one character to another, although he does tend to get lost when he does this.

From book cover:In the heart of Victorian England, an inquisitive gentleman known only as the Time Traveler constructs an elaborate invention that hurtles him hundreds of thousands of years into the future. There he finds himself in the violent center of the ultamat confilct between beings of light and creatures of darkness.
My thoughts: This being the first time I've read anything by H.G. Wells, I was mortified to find how real this story felt. Wells' talent of only making the reader accept a little bit of unreality, and folds a story out of that one simple idea. Very few authors have been able to do so much without pushing the reader to the edge of unbelievablity.
Political Undertones: I do not believe that Wells was going for a Political Writing when he sat down to write this book. I do believe that his feelings of the Upper/Lower caste system, of the time he wrote this book in, had a great impression on him. But one would be pushing the limits of their imagination to align this book with anything more than a romantic tale of a
