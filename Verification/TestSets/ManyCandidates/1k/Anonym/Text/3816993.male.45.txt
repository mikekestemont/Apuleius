one of those who was on the side of the “little guy” (along with God) against the powers (of the world). Yet, when taken from a larger, systemic perspective, as a  group  we easily could be lumped in with those labeled “proud”, “strong”, and “rich” for, after all, each of us had lived and continued to live a relatively privileged existence compared to the world’s “humble”, “poor”, and “vulnerable”.  Several people were unhappy with this interpretation. They asserted that God viewed everyone equally; that is was unfair to “lump” all Americans into the same group; that the notion that the Divine shows a “preference” of one group over another was antithetical to Friends’ belief that everyone had the Inward Light within them.  But, the workshop leader held to her point by asking us to consider how we might, if each of us had been born in a poor, mostly agrarian and traditional culture, view an American’s status in the world. If we had been born into such “lowly” circumstances wouldn’t it make sense to view those born in the U.S. as being “rich” and having greater power in the world? As people trailed out of the room it seemed that few were convinced that, given all that each of them had suffered in their lives and/or had done as individuals to fight for social justice, that they could still be viewed as one of those “powerful”, “haughty”, “rich” folks brought down by God in order to liberate those who had been humbled and made low by the “powers” of the world. People seemed much more energized by what feminist and creation spirituality perspectives had to offer on other days during the week-long workshop.  Nonetheless, the idea has stayed with me. And it seems to be echoed in what Camassia so nicely states in her post. I wonder how often I have made my political and social views into idols so that I can feel that I am on the “correct” side of an issue. At a broader level how many times do we (liberal) Friends in the U.S. think of ourselves as being on the side of the “little guy” fighting “against the powers” when, in fact, we might actually be on the other side of the equation, which includes self-righteousness, sanctimoniousness, pride, and privilege? Do we   truly   believe that there is a greater Truth than our own political and social views?
