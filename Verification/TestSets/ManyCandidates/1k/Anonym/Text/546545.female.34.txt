it all. 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink Chicory 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink jessamyn8470 .			 		 	   Katie and I had a relatively difficult day on Saturday ourselves.  Geoff packed for his trip and left for Indiana at about 11:30.  He spent the next four hours or so driving to Anderson.  Katie and I spent from about 11 in the morning until 4:30 in the afternoon trying to get her to sleep.  Finally, she slept for an hour and a half.  And then she woke up, and it was 6:00, and where had the day gone?    She made up for the difficult day, though, by going to sleep at 8:45 and not even making  a peep  until 4:30 in the morning (at which time she ate and then went back to sleep until 8 am!).  Heather & Arek (who live upstairs) had the monitor with them while I went to  urlLink Erin's bachelorette party  for a couple of hours, and they never even had to come downstairs.   This afternoon after I'd talked to my somewhat stressed-out mother, who'd called to let me know that she was a little stressed-out, I called her back.    I let her know that there was chocolate on the nightstand next to my bed, and that she shouldn't be afraid to use it.  Chocolate will help at least a little bit, right?  (Katie and I didn't end up going on any of the mini photo shoots that I had envisioned.  I took the photo above on Saturday morning, before Geoff left on his trip.  I have always loved the blue flowers of the chicory weed. Is that the same chicory that goes into coffee?)
And speaking of my birthday, Geoff made me a birthday cake, and this is what it looked like before I blew out all the candles with one mighty gust of breath.    (You know what?  I think I forgot to make a wish.  Is there a default wish, like a year's worth of happiness, or something?) 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink 34 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink jessamyn8470 .
Today is my birthday.  I'm 34 years old.    There's a  urlLink new entry  up in the  urlLink journal .
Katie had "solid" food for the first time yesterday - sweet potatoes. She didn't get a whole lot of them into her mouth, but she liked what she tasted.  After her first spoonful, she started reaching for the spoon herself.  When we gave her the spoon, she ended up hitting herself in the eyebrow, the cheek, the chin, the nose - sweet potatoes flew everywhere. 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink Katie is only an apprentice with the spoon...

I love being her mom. 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink American Girl 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink jessamyn8470 .
