tomorrow night.&nbsp; Mostly Steph took care of all of her stuff, so it is my things that are all over the place. And my room was a disaster. It is 9:34 and I am already just so beat.  &nbsp;  Tomorrow I have to finish my Featured Topic on SearchWin2000.com and then prepare for missing the next week of work. Then my mother is coming over to make food for our party and help me prepare. Steph got part of the day off, so she will help too! She has already done more than I have.  &nbsp;  I think the party will be fab.
On Friday I went to  urlLink Foxwoods  for the weekend...&nbsp;It was fabulous! Going to Foxwoods for the weekend is totally different from visiting for a few hours to gamble. Friday night&nbsp;I arrived, unpacked, changed and then had a few cocktails and an appetizer at  urlLink The Intermezzo Lounge.  Then&nbsp;I proceeded to the gourmet restaurant  urlLink Paragon  which was so amazing. It was at the top of the Grand Pequot Tower (where&nbsp;I stayed) and had a gorgeous view. The food was fabulous. It was a great night.   Saturday&nbsp;I woke up and ordered room service breakfast.&nbsp;I got an omelet and unfortunately they mistakenly put salmon in it. I love salmon, but it REALLY did not taste good in the morning in an omelet. From there&nbsp;I went down to the casinos. First I tried&nbsp;my luck at the slots... And lost my money and fast! I still feel that I will be the one to hit the huge jackpot someday. Then I played my usual game of roulette.&nbsp;&nbsp;  I decided to have a quick and casual lunch at the  urlLink Veranda Cafe . Then I took a nap and did not stir again until 9:00pm.&nbsp;I showered and went down to try&nbsp;my luck again at 10:30pm.   At about 1:00am I was starving and decided to have&nbsp;my "dinner."&nbsp;I really did it Vegas style!&nbsp;I ate at  urlLink The Golden Dragon  a Japanese restaurant. YUMMY sushi!!   Sunday&nbsp;I slept until 12:00 and then packed and checked out.&nbsp;I couldn't resist spending the rest of the day there though, so&nbsp;I proceeded to eat at  urlLink The Festival Buffet . Then&nbsp;I tried&nbsp;my luck one more time and FINALLY won at roulette!!   When&nbsp;I came home,&nbsp;I rented the movie  urlLink The Butterfly Effect . It was terrific and you must see it!   It was a wonderful weekend overall! Hey, and if you are looking for a good, light book to read, check out "Shop Girl" by Steve Martin... Yes, THE Steve Martin.
We are all moved in now. Today we got our cable, internet and phone hooked up, and despite past negative experiences with Comcast, the gentleman who came to hook me up today knew exactly what he was doing and did everything correctly. It was such a nice difference! AND my cats are finally home! Berkley and Chloe are still adjusting to the new surroundings, but they are home, and that's all that matters. Tomorrow my couch set get delivered and then this apartment is going to be fab! I am so e
