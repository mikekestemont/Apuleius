thinks we should move. it sounds like we're staying here, but i have no idea! it's still kind of up in the air. I hope it all works out soon, i just want to know! then, josh went to Ricky's house (again, it's like Ricky took over Ian's job, he's now our surrogate brother and Ian never comes over anymore... hmm.).  hannah waited for Caitlin to come over (much to my dismay).  so, my dad took Joel and I to go get a movie. we ended up with  Starsky and Hutch  and  The Italian Job . I was the only one who watched them both, resulting in not going to bed until about 1. but then, i got bored, so in reality i stayed up till about 2:30 again... i didn't mean to! it just happens!       today, i woke up at 12:30 again. and my mom is looking at antique shops with Cindi. but, when she gets back, i get to go get my permit!!!!!!!!! watch out world, here i come!    Currently listening to   Sway- Vanessa Carlton
well, ok, the team was awful and we should have beat them, by like, 5 points (at least). but... WE DIDN'T!!! i played awful, i should've scored about thrice and i kept losing the ball, i didn't play good defense... it was really stupid! but, oh well, at least we didn't lose! that would have been awful! it was just scary because we played a team from the lower division, so they don't know how to play as well (sadly, they're about at my skill level) and so they just kind of flail around. and it's scary so i try to stay away from the scary people, but they're usually my mark and... so yeah, it's not good usually. ANYWAYS, we got home and we watched Michael. i like that movie...  BATTLE!!!!!!!!!!!  then, i took a shower and came on here.        oh my goodness!!!!!!!!!  guess what i had for dinner tonight?!?!?!?!?!?!?? BAKED BEANS!!! hahaha! it was great!      well, that's all i'm going to say about that. OOO! except that, i got an Elijah Wyman cd today! Joel burned it for me! he's so cool! none of you have probably (if you have, it's amazing) heard of him, because he doesn't have a record company (but, he has a cd... i didn't get it either, ask joel) and he lives in RI! he's joel's friend, and he has an amazing voice!!       ok, NOW i'm done!    Currently listening too   El Condor Pasa- Simon and Garfunkal
Heaven holds a place for those who pray! haha, good song. good movie too, come to that.  Today, i almost didn't wake up, but i did. I went to church, Jenessa came over, we hung out! yeah, that's all i did. yesterday ricky, sierra, chelsey, and kandis all came over and they burned cds for like 5 hours! so, that's why i wasn't on the computer last night. tonight i'm going to play soccer, so i will post the outcome when i get back! tootles!    currently listening to   The Boxer- Simon and G
