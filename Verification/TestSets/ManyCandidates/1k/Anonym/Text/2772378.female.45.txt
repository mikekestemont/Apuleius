There would be plenty of room in the trunk. He grandly agreed we could stop at the bookstore on the way out of town and pick up some books I had ordered. We had enough room for ALL THREE.  I brought the satellite radio unit from my car thinking I could survive the hours with Court TV, CNN Headline and the comedy channels blasting through his Bose system. We hit construction delays before Jacksonville.  The good news, you can talk while sitting still. The bad news, conversation makes little sense in the heady mixture of sizzling, direct sun and carbon monoxide.  After another 200 miles I stumbled into a Dairy Queen rest room. When I moved the shoulder of my shirt I saw a perfect Betsy Ross white/red stripe. I didn't even have to ask. He put the top up for the rest of the way.  Later that night, we took the top down again as we waited for my brother and his family to come out of their hotel and follow us to our hotel in their car.  My nieces, 12 and 7, audibly gasped when they saw their very cool Uncle Charlie behind the wheel. My brother humbly apologized for their rental sedan.

By Saturday they tettered on the precipice between fragrant and turning. It was time to take back the kitchen. I bought the additional ingredients and started with a large peach cobbler and a batch of peach jam. After another grocery run for raspberries and more pectin it went to peach-raspberry jam. Pits, peels and juice covered every available surface, but fresh fruit remained. Another pectin and raspberry run and the problem was literally contained. So maybe we had to throw away some food to make room in the freezer. We triumphed. The peaches didn't win this time. Beware of roadside strangers bearing k
