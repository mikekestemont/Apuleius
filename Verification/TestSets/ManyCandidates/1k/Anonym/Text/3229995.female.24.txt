get through 3 guys with supernatural powers wearing lampshades on their heads and shooting electricity out of their fingers, the Room of the Upside-Down Hell and a whole lot of black magic monsters. And what happens in the end? The bad guy dies, Jack and Gracie fall in love, Chinatown is once again a safe place...and Jack hits the road again.   WHO WROTE THIS DIALOGUE?  Jack complains about the loss of his truck, Wang says: "How do you think I feel Jack? I lost the whole girl!" Toasting a drink that will give them supernatural powers in the rescue: Wang: "Here's to the army and navy, and the battle's they have won, here's to America's colours, the colours that never run." Jack: "May the wings of liberty never loose a feather." Egg while explaining some "Chinese history": "Anybody who showed up was going to join Lim Lee in the Hell of Being Cut to Pieces. Jack: "Hell of what?" Egg: "Chinese have a lot of hells."
the price us girls pay for perfection: Hunger!!   Situation one : "Damn im hungry" yells your stomach, as it churns and rumbles, but your mind screams, "No, you'll regret it when your ass won't fit into your new sass and bides, don't do it".   Why is it that our bodies suffer for a pair of jeans? well considering they are a $200 pair then that seems ok. so really the price of perfection in this case is $200 + GST + HUNGER....."thanks for shopping with us here at "I STARVE FOR FASHION", enjoy your day!!   Situation two:  PORK? BEEF? or SIRLOIN with that side salad mam?   "just the salad thanks, oh, and NO dressing,ta."  Please admit that you have resorted to both these situations in hope of loosing weight. As lame as that sounds, i must admit that i sure have. But i've come to the conclusion that no matter how many diets i tackle, or as many hours i exercise, my own body just can't be manipulated to what i consider the 'perfect' form because, drum roll please.... IT DOESN'T EXIST!! but why?.... cliche time again: beauty lies in the eye of the beholder. the number of times i've seen my friends parade around in next to nothing, or nothing at all, and thought, "wow", is unaccountable for. ive had to listen to them say how much they dislike their bodies, when from my perspective, through my eyes, they are amazing. And if you were to recieve a compliment, your reaction would be, "are you blind?" its strange how easily we are blinded by fashion, the media's perception of the ideal perfect form, yet more significantly by our own insecurities of how we look! is this a reflection of women, in general, feeling as if they need to gain beauty to secure a man, to satisify his desire for beauty? or is it within each of us girls to naturally question who we are?  ok im going to stop now, im getting hell spiritual and deep, too much for my likeing! rhetoric this rhetoric t
