Man this one dude was so drunk lol...hahaha!  But yeah, I'm here now, thinking about a bunch of things...wanna know? Ok...I'll tell you anyways...  Brandon...just in general lol...idk why?!  Aron...same...and also thinking about last night...again idk why?!  Volleyball tryouts tomorrow...man I think I am gonna suck tomorrow, cuz I am gonna be sore, plus my sunburn! Grrness  School lol! Ahh lol idk why I'm thinkin about this either lol, but I just am, I mean I'm excited to go back, hell yeah cuz I want a boyfriend lol basically I just wanna see some people, and meet the new freshmen lol...yay freshies! Then again, I don't want summer to end...at all...!  Yeah, I think that's all...idk but ttyl...! Much love!
Man, today seriously effin sucked. Volleyball for me was horrible! I mean since today was the last day of conditioning before tryouts, we played 2 games, and then you could either scrimmage, or work on things with coach. Well we played 2 games of dodgeball (volleyball style, which is different from normal dodgeball), then we played 3 games of Snake...(it's a serving game). After that, I went off with coach, and a group of others. I practiced setting, and then i went with group and did passing and hitting. Then we did a 'freeball' drill...and I just kept sucking...I'm just pretty mad...I don't know why I'm so upset over it, but yeah, you know. Anyways, I might go to Ashley Bevan's tonight...and then tomorrow, we might go to the movies with Nick Spinelli, Brandon, and Alicia...but who knows. Hopefully we will get to go. Oh yeah, and tomorrow, I also have a carwash for volleyball from 10am-2pm...but I'm only going from 10-12.  Well yeah, I'm gonna go now. Talk to you later...maybe...
So far, this summer has been alright...kind of boring...but you know. I finally started talking to some people I haven't talked to in a while, like Sam, Colin, and a few others. Here are some updates...lol...  Yeah, I   think   I like Brandon...but I'm so lost and confused...I don't know what to feel anymore...  Volleyball conditioning has started, and it sucks because it's right in the middle of the day...3:30 to 5:30! grr...tryouts are August 9th to the 11th...Debo (our Varsity Coach...also known as Coach Brown), and Coach Golden (our Junior Varsity coach...who is a total grrness!)...yeah they are making cuts this year...so yeah hopefully I will make it...I think I will...but idk...  Yeah man, I can't think of anything else really...I mean I haven't really written much in here anyway, so what's it matter...no one reads these anyways...  So uh yeah...I'm gonna go...lots of l
