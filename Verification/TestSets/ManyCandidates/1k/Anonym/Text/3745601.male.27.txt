Eventually, I would also like a section detailing the positive traits of each candidate.&nbsp; I feel the media gives us enough biased negative information.   My sisters wedding was perfect.&nbsp; I swear she looked like one of the models that you see in the wedding magazines.&nbsp; I did not avoid the "When are you going to settle down?" question.&nbsp; My great-grandmother (bless her heart) posed the question to me&nbsp;as soon as she could at the reception.&nbsp; She then followed it up by a quick "Don't worry, you have plenty of time." pity statement that all people tend to give singles.&nbsp; I agree with  urlLink Maisy Day  in this entry of her's that being single is not a disease.&nbsp; It is not something that can be 'cured'.   Tank stayed with me again this past Monday.&nbsp; I am really glad that I am getting the chance to hang with him before he goes to the  urlLink Art Institute of Pittsburg .&nbsp; The guy is so talented it hurts, but so humble he doesn't know it.&nbsp; Penguin did not come by this past week.&nbsp; I did see him on one day, but I think I picked on him a little too much.&nbsp; I was agrivated at a percieved slight and took it out on him.&nbsp; I had a really great lunch with Popeye this past Tuesday at Applebee's.&nbsp; It was short, but helped me see the bigger picture with what is going on in my life.&nbsp; The service  and  the food were great.&nbsp; Popeye said his steak was not as good as he has had in the past.   I am currently doing a little light reading of some works of  urlLink C. S. Lewis .&nbsp; I have come to the conclusion that he  is  a great thinker.&nbsp; I know it is not news for many of you, but I am not one to take someone at thier word.&nbsp; I have to research it and see it for myself.

My grandparents have finished moving into their new house. One of the 'three amigos' from my past has come into town. He is moving to  urlLink Perth , but wanted to say his goodbye's to us.
