much about repercussions of my actions, ultimately accomplishing nothing.  I suppose one more night on the couch won't kill me.  I'll just be pissed when mammaw wakes me up in 3 hours so she can sit in her spot and watch Good Morning America.  really, really pissed.  the only thing that's keeping me from jumping off a bridge is the fact that i've got songs from the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band CD stuck in my head. it's got to be one of the best albums ever made.  My favorite of all time:  Picture yourself in a boat on a river, With tangerine trees and marmalade skies Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly, A girl with kaleidoscope eyes. Cellophane flowers of yellow and green, Towering over your head. Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes, And she’s gone.  Lucy in the sky with diamonds.  Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain Where rocking horse people eat marshmellow pies, Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers, That grow so incredibly high. Newspaper taxis appear on the shore, Waiting to take you away. Climb in the back with your head in the clouds, And you’re gone.  Lucy in the sky with diamonds,  Picture yourself on a train in a station, With plasticine porters with looking glass ties, Suddenly someone is there at the turnstyle, The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes.
