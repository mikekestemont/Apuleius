could be difficult.  he said he is going to get married on the cruise just to spite her.  i don’t think so, i said.  we need to take your parents feelings into account here.  she only gave birth to you, got you through some really tough times when you were a child and seen you grow into a great man.  i think you owe her this much to let her see you get married.  now we are looking at a yacht that goes out of mystic, ct.  the only thing is that it only holds 80 people which means we would have to significantly cut our invite lists down to meet that requirement.  i would rather just have my immediate family and friends there than my extended family.  i hardly ever see my extended family.  why should i pay for a party for them?  does that sound harsh?  i would like to only invite the aunts, uncles and cousins that i see the most.  there are some that i haven’t seen in over 6 or so years!!  so, the date and place is still up in the air.  i will keep you updated as plans get solidified.
