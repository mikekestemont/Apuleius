much more than just a song to me. I feel something inside me when i hear this song, or read this song. It touches me in so many different ways. Word for Word...i feel this song.-jess  I'm so tired of being here  Surpressed by all of my childish fears And if you have to leave  I wish that you would just leave  Because your presence still lingeres here  And it wont leave me alone  These wounds wont seem to heal   This pain is just to real There's just to much that time cannot erase  When you cried I wiped away all of your tears  When you's scream i'd fight away all of your fears And I've held your hand through all of these years  But you still have all of me  You use to captivate me   By your resonating light But now I'm bound by this life you left behind  Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams Your voice it chased away all of the sanity in me   These wounds wont seem to heal  This pain is just to real There's just to much that time cannot erase  When you cried I wiped away all of your tears  When you'd scream i'd fight away all of your fears And i've held your hand through all of these years  But you still have all of me  I've tried so hard to tell myself that   your gone And though your still with me  I've been alone all along
It seemed so real... vividly i remember moments when kisses were from the depth of your unstable heart Those clear blue eyes penetrated thoroughly into my soul While your semingly honest words spoke of nothing but sweet love and genuine tenderness Yet this was but a dream... For: Your kisses were from an unknown source made only in the moment  And your transparent blue eyes  decieved and permeated into my pour oblivious soul But those clever words were false  and untrue So now i'm left wil dreams... turned to wishes.

Broken  I wanted you to know I love the way you laugh I wanna hold you high and steal your pain away I keep your photograph; I know it serves me well I wanna hold you high and steal your pain  ‘Cause I’m broken when I’m open And I don’t feel like I am strong enough ‘Cause I’m broken when I’m lonesome And I don’t feel light when you’re gone away  The worst is over now and we can breathe again I wanna hold you high, you steal my pain away There’s so much left to learn, and no one left to fight I wanna hold you high and steal your pain  ‘Cause I’m broken when I’m open  And I don’t feel like I am strong enough ‘Cause I’m broken when I’m lonesome And I don’t feel right when you’re gone away  ‘Cause I’m broken when I’m open And I don’t feel like I am strong enough ‘Cause I’m broken when I’m lonesome And I don’t feel light when you’re gone a
