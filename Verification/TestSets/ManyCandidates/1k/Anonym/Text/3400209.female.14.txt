  Background of self-injurers:  In general, persons seeking treatment are usually from a middle to upperclass background, of average to high and intelligence, and have low self-esteem. Nearly fifty percent report physical and or sexual abuse during his or her child. Many report (as high as 90 %) that they were discouraged from expressing emotions, particularly, anger and sadness.   Behavior patterns.  Many who self-harm used multiple methods. Cutting/scratching arms or legs is the most common practice. Self injurers may attempt to conceal the resultant scarring with clothing, and if discovered, often make excuses as to how an injury happened. The most common excuse is "The cat scratched me". A significant number are also struggling with eating disorders and alcohol or substance abuse problems. And estimated one half to two-thirds of self injurers have an eating disorder.   Reason for behaviors.  Self- injurers commonly report that they feel empty inside, over or under stimulated, unable to express their feelings, lonely, not understood by others and fearful of intimate relationships and adult responsibilities. Self injury is their way to cope with or relieve painful or hard- to- express feelings and is generally not a suicide attempt. But relief is temporary, and a self-destructive cycle often develops without proper treatment.   Dangers.  Self- injurers often become desperate about their lack of self-control and the addictive-like nature of their acts, which may lead them to true suicide attempts. The self -injury behaviors may also cause more harm than intended, which could result in medical complications or death. Eating disorders and alcohol or substance abuse intensify the threats to the individual's overall health and quality of life.   Diagnoses.  The diagnosis for someone who self-injurers can only be determined by a licensed psychiatric professional. Self-harm behavior can be a symptom of several psychiatric illness: Personality Disorders (esp.Borderline Personality Disorder); Bipolar Disorder (Manic Depression); Major Depression; Anxiety Disorders; as well as psychoses such as Schizophrenia.   Evaluation.  If someone displays the signs and symptoms of self- injury, a mental health professional with self- injury expertise should be consulted. An evaluation or assessment is the first step, followed by a recommended course of treatment to prevent this self-destructive cycle from continuing.    Treatment.  Self-injury treatment options include outpatient therapy, partial (6-12 hours a day) and inpatient hospitalization. When the behaviors interfere with daily living, such as employment, school and relationships, and or are health or life-threatening, a specialized self injury hospital program with experienced staff is recommended.   The effective treatment of self-injury is most often a combination of medication, Cognitive/behavioral therapy, and interpersonal therapy, supplemented by other treatment services as needed. Medication is often useful in the management of depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, and the racing thoughts that may accompany self-injury. Cognitive/behavioral therapy that incorporate contracts, journals, and behavioral logs are useful tools for regaining self-control. Interpersonal therapy assist individuals in gaining insight and skills for the development and maintenance of relationships, and helps individuals understand their destructive thoughts and behaviors. Services for eating disorders, alcohol/substance abuse, trauma abuse, and family therapy should be readily available and integrated into treatment, depending on individual n
