Locker room. Wrong. He must have forgotten something, and saunters back over to his locker on the other side over the room. Repeat the admiring of said locker, and back into the showers.  Why? Is it so hard to put on a towel? I am pretty sure he'd probably walk around the entire gym if it wasn't illegal.  The moral of the story is this. While you may be proud of yourself naked, there is a pretty good chance that you are CREEPING EVERYONE ELSE THE HELL OUT. Please stop. For the children, the kittens, baby Jesus and whatever other entity you are offending.
Eating an entire thing of Cinnamon Tic-Tacs in five minutes MAY make you want to puke.  Carry on.
Spent some time with  urlLink Doom 3  last night. Overall thoughts, keeping is short - it's the same game you've played 1,000 times, just prettier. Sure, you'll be impressed by the graphics, especially if you have a nice fast system. Even at 800x600, which I have to play at, it looks damn good. But once you get over the oooh's and ahhh's, you start seeing the shortcomings. There is virtually no  urlLink physics  system. The environment allows very little interaction, if any at all. You'll spend most of your time in small, cramped spaces endlessly killing things over and over. There are no  urlLink alternative ways  to accomplish something - it's all straight ahead, into the next area. While these things certainly do not make a bad game (sometimes mass destruction is good!) they don't urlLink  compel me to keep playing  either. In my opinion, Riddick was a much better game, and looked nearly as good. And that was on the xbox. I don't think Half-Life 2 has much to be worried about.  Next.
Sometimes I wish I could re-open the toast just to give a game a fair review. Then quickly close it down again. With haste. This will of course never happen, but hey...  The game in question is  urlLink Sudeki  on the  urlLink Xbox . The  urlLink reviews  have not been terrible, but they have not been overly kind either. After playing for a good three hours, I can say most of the reviews are a bit too low. Maybe expectations were set too high, or people thought it was something other than delivered. I don't know. It's a fun RPG that is heavy on the action side, with lots of items to collect and cool places to explore. I really don't see much difference from games like Final Fantasy, except I actually control the battle in real time, and don't have to listen to brooding, whiny characters.  I also picked up  urlLink Dues Ex 2 , and am finally able to enjoy it. I gave the PC version a shot, but it ran like crap, and I had to lower the detail and resolution just to be able to play it. Reason 1,784 why I really dislike PC games. I'll take a console any day, kthx.  Edit: It looks like  urlLink someone got it right . Go, A
