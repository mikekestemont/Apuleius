the time, and really, I don't think about smiling or frowning all that much. It doesn't mean I'm depressed, last I checked, yeah I have problems that I need to work out - being jobless, "living" in Sacramento after moving from San Francisco. I did the move for school purposes, and I need to deal with that, and I'm perfectly capable of doing so. I'm not frowning because I'm here - only when I come back after having visited a real city, and remembering how much I left behind, but then I remember that I left it behind to better myself. This thought doesn't make me estatic by any streatch of the imagination, but I'm hardly reaching for the razor blade.  Things could be better, but they could be worse - its an emotional void actually, I'm not numb, I just can't be bothered by extremes right now as they drain my energy, which I need to focus on getting the hell out of Dodge.  I have been reminded by friends that I am far too guarded. My first thoughts (yes all at once) are: Fuck you, they're right, there's nothing I can do that I'm comfortable doing. There are those that find comfort in the bottle, those that find comfort in pills or needles, and those that find comfort in the smoke. I do fit in the bottle group, my guard does drop, and I'm more sociable. I do't want to find comfort in any of those things, which is why I  rarely  drink, and I have done both "E" and the leaf, but have no need or desire to do them again. I want to find my comfort on my own, with my own strength, see what I can do - and work off that.  Some of the other sisters have indulged in the leaf and bottle, and being the sober one, I see that there is no strength in these activities. I've witnessed their strength without the substances. They believe there is strength - or some shamanistic wisdom in imbibing while doing public service. Do they (the ones that do indulge) do a good job with blessings while high - honestly, yes they do. The ones that don't indulge - do a good job as well. Is it fair for me to judge? I think it is, especially because I know what these people are capable of on their own - they seem to believe they need a crutch - or an idol to say "this helped." This is my opinion of what I see.  What does this have to do with my superficial happiness or lack thereof? I want it all to be real, natural - it means more (to me, the one feeling the emotions). I won't stop myself from happiness or sadness as doing so is (in my opinion) unhealthy. Just because I'm not smiling, does not mean I'm not happy - and anyone who's worked reatil can tell you that is really easy to think "I hate you, you foul cheap bastard" while s
