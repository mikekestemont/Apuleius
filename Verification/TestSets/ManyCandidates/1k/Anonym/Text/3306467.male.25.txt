 I didn't follow the whole trial but I have an Indonesian friend said the two boys were paid and most likely seduced William to have sex with them. So where is the line in this case? Then William obviously got blackmailed or entrapped by someone hidden... Mostly because he was a friend of a known Australian paedophile who has passed away.  When you are caught in this kind of situation when someone is out to get you, what would you do?  Cold.  Dead-cold On a "happier" and slightly warmer note, I finally met this guy whom eyes met mine when I was cleaning on the Lower Ground(underpass to a train station) a couple of momths ago. He was exchanging numbers with another Thai guy(competition?), happy(obviously had sex... they had "sex" in the showers in a city gym). To keep it short, we finally met at McDonalds to have a coffee. He took off his jacket to show off his large arms and of course nice figure in his singlet when we talked.  Until he talked I felt he is the typical Macho Mary - built body but super sissy. He kept smiling at me; he is quite handsome, preppy looking BUT his smile is both piercing and errie at the same time. Probably errie is because he had that 'sissy' tingy to it... But with that kind of body.... :)~~~~    I need a drool cup.  He gave me his landline number instead of his mobile... The reason why he couldn't afford a mobile is because he is "in-between jobs" but he is "rich enough" to travel blah blah blah. Inconsistent and illogical!   He is just playing hard to get but then...  :)~~~~~  just one fling pleaseeee!!!
Wow! My very own first post!  I am not expecting anyone to really find my posts fascinating but I would like to find an outlet to write out my diary. Simple as that... If anyone would read them and make friends through that, that would be a great bonus. Otherwise, I would be happy just to type. :)  Let me introduce myself: I am 25 year old Singapore Chinese boy living in Sydney. I have been in Australia for about two years now, gave up my lousy defence job in Singapore because of hating my supervisor and because I am an idiot as well, packed up my bags to study in one of the universities in Australia and be with someone.   Sometimes I wonder if leaving my job was the right thing to do... Despite graduating from the university a year ago, my current job(Cleaning) has nothing to do with my IT qualifications. Lots of let downs for the past two years but it has been an adventure that few would be able to tell. So be glad you are reading!! haha!  BTW I like American country songs to the likes of George Strait, Dixie Chicks, Kenny Chesney, Alan Jackson to name a few. Watching Dixie Chicks concert DVD right now and I must tell you they sure rock!   That's my first post, more coming s
