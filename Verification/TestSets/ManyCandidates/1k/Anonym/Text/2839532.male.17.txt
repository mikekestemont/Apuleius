him how much it would cost, and he said he'd think about it.  Hopefully he'll call.. As far as Happy Wok, well, I hope to make an online ordering system for them.  I won't bother with the specifics here though...  Danie's in New York visiting family and will be till the 22nd i think... and I'm leaving for Rhode Island the 23rd.  I miss her a lot.  Anyways, I hope that Morgan actually comes through this time and does the site.. I don't have time for it right now.  I guess if he doesn't hold up his bargain, I may just have to do it myself.. ah well.  Anyways, look for updates on that.  Ta ta for now.
Alright.  Today's been interesting.. even though my previous post was from today, it was from a completely different day.  I've been so out of it cause of the perkaset, trying to keep the pain down and whatnot...  Anyways, I got some new ideas for various art projects, and coding projects too.. I'll post updates about that soon.  ttyl
Current Events:  July 4th, Been going out with Danie for 10 months, got a powerbook, gotten into art (kinda), stuff like that.  I've also heavily gotten into business.  I currently work at a used car dealership doing the website -  urlLink Autohaus Webb  - and I get to drive around those cars some.  I've been coming up with various other ideas, such as pen making, and web design.  Now to just put them into action.  Oh yeah, and I've been reading good books (The Color of Water).  Anyways, I'm going to check out the blogger api tonight, and hopefully within the next couple days I will have created a blogging app for os x that will make it so I needn't blog through blogger.com itself, rather so that I can just type and edit and whatnot through a program on my comp.  This blog will probably be a variety of personal, technical, philosophical, business-oriented, and just plain rambling blogs, so I hope you enjoy this as much as I hope I do.
Just reset the blog, and will now hopefully keep it up to date with shit going on.
Well, here I am unable to sleep due to rapid thoughts running rampid through my head.  I'm probably going to redesign the autohaus webb website (again) but make it very very good and am figuring out how much to charge, what to do, etc... I think I'm going to make it really cool this time.  Anyways, I had braimstorms while trying to fall alseep, so I woke up to jot down my ideas.  Schools started and thats fun.  I like all my classes and teachers except for ap calc.  I love calc, don't get me wrong, its just that the teacher, to all appearances, is boring as hell.  I hope to find some method of entertainment in that class.  My last two periods of the day are both directed study (aka do whatever I like for a grade) so thats a nice way to end the day.  uhm.. yeah.  b
