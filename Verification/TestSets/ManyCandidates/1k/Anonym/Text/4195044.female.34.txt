 With Online Banking, you manage all your portfolio via the internet. It is very   SECURE  . Banks give you this " Identifer " code - a tiny calculator-like machine which is programmed to match a series of number codes together with your Pin. Brilliant really. These sober-looking Cloggies would probably give you their winning cheesy grin and say  Gaaf ! In reality, these Dutchies just want mundane things to be   SIMPLER ,  FAST ,  EFFICIENT ,  ORGANIZED   and   CHEAP  .  Nifty swifty, is how you can describe transacting all financial movements over the internet.  Muah!  Kusje  Dutch banks :-)
Oh gawd, I am so dang tired. :-(      Last night I stayed up 'till 2:30AM checking jobs online. Found two. I revised my cover letter so I can induce some sparks and catch any attention worth catching! Boom, sent it. The next morning I got two responses. That was quick, really. I didn't match to their profile and requirements! What news - Life. Ack. Oh well, you win some, you lose all!       Work. I am still ZERO on the board.      Was nice to be back in the centrum of   Amsterdam  . Dutchman asked me to join dinner together with his business colleague from the UK, Matt er  Mister  Matt.   Leidseplein   was it... an intoxicating place. Beertje then Thai food. Uuummm nice for a change.... except that the waiting ladies took a long time to wait on us for the food to be served! Moreover, all I heard the whole evening was the ubiquitous and riotous word, " Mister ". Don't ask what it means because you'll never get it anyway. A niche in  Mister  Dutchman's world, kind of a secret boys club password.      And surprise surprise.... Pat called! It's been ages. We are getting together come Friday evening. Aaaahh friends...     bewitching.
The  Foto  actually worked! Thanks Friendster for hosting it :-)      My tales for the day...       Ugh I am tired. I watched half of the " The Last Samurai " last night. It was freaking 2AM when I drift off to bed. Dutchman didn't even noticed me!    At Work....      I am close to snapping at this  Fat Bitch  in the office, who can't seem to handle a decent conversation, even with my boss, her boss. Why does she have to scream her tonsils out into her brains in order to get a point across? Talk about harrassment! Nothing is ever good enough with her ONLY IF you first consult her timeless wisdom and discernment. Perhaps she is seething with boiling animosity that we now get to report to the same person!      Then the new toy, my  HP Pavilion ze551ea  is doing ' Fijn '.       By the way, ' Kut weer ' is back - rainshowers and a 19C temperature, supposedly for a nice summer day today.... BUT yesterday was 31C?  Wat is er aan de hand?  What did the Dutch do to deserve this kind of earthly punishment?
I am sooo peeved! I wrote a ton of bloggies and when I hit " Publish ", everything vanished into thin air!?  Is this bloody BLOG w
