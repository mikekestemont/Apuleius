PERCENT of us. Give me a break. I just want to weep. And then I think of my brothers and sisters who are at  least  30% of our population who face this kind of exclusion daily.... whose cause is much more dear to my heart than this poor white man... Oh Goddess, will we never learn? &nbsp; Words are so powerful. By thinking things, saying things, writing them, shouting them, singing them -- we bring them into being. How we say things and the way we use words reveals so very much. I cringe whenever I hear someone say "It's only words" because words are the stuff of spells and witchery and easily misused to the detriment of us all.  &nbsp; I really don't want that male nurse to feel excluded or unimportant in our profession. But I don't want him to feel INcluded at my expense or that of my sisters. I think sometimes that is a very male problem -- they can't WIN unless someone else loses. They don't want to stand arm in arm with you, they have to be in front or life isn't good.  &nbsp; I would like there to be a pronoun that really includes all of us. I would like to learn to be a real sister to all other humans. I would like my brothers to not feel insulted, or perhaps to even feel flattered, if called  she . I would like to be rid of my own feelings of inferiority over being female.  &nbsp; I have just finished reading a book by Derrick Bell called  Faces at the Bottom of the Well.  It is an extraordinary treatise on the permanence of racism in the United States. I highly recommend it. And I think that is what got me off on the subject of sexism. There are injustices so deeply rooted in our social and political system, that I think it is nearly impossible to even SEE them. But we must look, search, seek and resist. We must use our own experiences as the basis for trying to understand the experiences of others, and hopefully one day to unite, under a common pronoun, that leaves no HUMAN behind.  &nbsp; Peace.
My Bug-eyed dog died last Friday. I am very sad, and miss her desperately. It was baffling, so I had an autopsy done, and she had a congenital weakness in her diaphragm, which suddenly and spontaneously ruptured. She wasn't even 6 months old yet.  On the other hand, my old dog Sadie doesn't miss Bug at all.
Another pet peeve -- the word "whatever". I cringe when I hear it, it is so overused, cliched and juvenile. It amazes me how many grown people will use this word as if it still had the freshness it possessed in 1972. Used as a sarcastic dismissal, it is enough to convince me totally that the person using it thus is totally lacking in intellect and wit. I think anyone who uses "whatever" in that manner should be made to pay a heavy fine to the grammar p
