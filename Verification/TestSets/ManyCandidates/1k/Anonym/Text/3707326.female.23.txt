day and had some coffee.  really a good time to be with most of my closest friends.  awwww saps.  i've never smoked so much in my life.           alright, that'll do it for now.  i'll post some pictures sometime tomorrow, (IF PEOPLE SEND THEM TO ME).  and then this weekend it's off to roman's wedding with my date, dean dean the sex machine.  should be fun.     alana 'it's embarrassing to read quotes that i said that i don't remember saying but i'm pretty sure i would have cause all the wine that i drank makes me lose all concepts of appropriateness or however the fuck it's spelled don't make fun of me i'm a really good speller though it wouldn't seem like it from camp booze" raines
CURRENT MOOD:   happy CURRENT MUSIC:   the sound of crickets chirping.  motherfuckers. NOTABLE QUOTE:  see below.   ACCEPTABLE SUBSTITUTIONS FOR MARCO POLO:  "cross!"..."jesus!"  "donkey punch!"..."alana!"  "cleveland steamer!"..."alana!"  "lord of the..."balls!"  "my sweet baby"..."girl!"  "marco!"..."faggot!"  "marco!"..."sparkles!"  "marco!"..."i'm over here!"  "spiderman!"..."gonzo!"  "rim!"..."job!"    so over the last couple of days we've been swimming at scott's aunt's house.  really fucking cool.  for some reason, even though the youngest among us is 21 years old, we can't get enough of marco polo.  the first day it was all innocent, but apparently scott and james figured out that they can grab my boobs and blame it on their eyes being closed.  whatever.  at least you're trying to get some.  i was starting to worry.  CAMP BOOZE IN 2 DAYS!!!  oh snap!  very excited for the trip now.  i thought only a few would be going on thursday, but turns out that just about everyone will be there that night sometime.  except sara.  and you can TOTALLY bet that she's going to have to give everyone hand jobs as soon as she gets there to make up for her absence.   just read the weather report.  says the highs for the weekend will be in the low 70s.  not bad.  wouldn't mind a bit hotter, but at least we won't die of heat exhaustion.  everyone, plan accordingly.   STILL NEED CAR INFO FROM BRET, SARA, LUKE, NATALIE, MAYBE NOAH.  sidenote:  way bummed that jt and james can't go.  we'll take loads of pictures for you guys.     so once the booze hunting trip is over, we have roman's wedding next weekend in morgantown.  i have 2 new dresses for the occasion, one for the rehearsal dinner, and one for the wedding.  i look outstanding in both.  looking forward to making out with roman's hot engineering friends, if such a thing exists.  but really, it will be nice to be apart of roman's big day.  i think he and amber make an excellent couple and will enjoy a wonderful life of hugs, smiles, babies, and timeless catch phrases.  WEEEEELLLL.  aight.  off to bed.  big day of cpr training with tnut, erin is coming in for the booze experience, and the food/beer shopping spree at sam's.  probably won't blog until sunday night sometime.  check back for camp booze quotes and pics.  much love.  alana "blame it on my vagina" r
