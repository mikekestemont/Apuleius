car accident yesterday around noon while she took godmom and her friends who are visiting from taiwan to kits beach. something about when they were gonna make a rite turn the car behind them didn't break in time and bumped into them a little bit. (O__O);;;  so it was nothing serious really and they were alright. the bumper is a bit twisted but the car's pretty ok too. tho we still had to take it to repair this morning cuz we filed a claim to icbc. we thought it's a pretty minor fix, but the repair shop said it's gonna take at least 2 days.. (*__*);;; it's ok tho, they gave us a car to drive around so at least we won't be stranded in our house.  by the time we finished doing all those bothersome things it's around noon. mom really didn't have the mind and the energy to cook lunch herself so we dined out again. took her to chianti's cafe cuz it's just nearby. and it's a great time to go there today too cuz they have this pasta frenzy event every mon/tues in which all pastas are discounted (^O^)  me tried their carbonara today. it's kinda hard to find original carbonara, or it's just that i didn't look hard enough?! cuz i've never had one here at all! i've had some in japan~ and while the ones there were pretty good too, the carbonara here's more authentic i think~ and the one at chianti is definitely amazing~ (^O^)   lalala~ i ♥ pasta~!!! （≧∀≦） haha! *crazy*     oh! tho i can't believe it's already mid-august!!! aaah~~!!! cuz i haven't finished writing all my summer greeting cards!!! (>___  it just takes me a long time to write in japanese these days so i kept stalling... must send them out before the end of the month tho!!! i already have to change it into 残暑見舞い now since it's almost the end of summer... (---__---);;; aiya~ me bad......    oh! and there's exactly 4 weeks left before mom and i go back to taiwan. that is of course, if i can't find a job by then... by now, i guess the outlooks don't look so good. just cuz i've been looking for 4 1/2 months now, and still nada. so what makes me think i'd find one in another 1 month?! (>___  going back creates a lot of problems tho. first and foremost, what's gonna happen to our cute little house here?!?? fall/winter's coming up soon, so there'd be lots of fallen leaves... and also it's gonna be dark for long hrs of the day so it's more dangerous for break-ins and whatnot... *sigh* i still wanna stay here sooo badly tho......  hmm... think i should go buy those albums that i've been wanting for some time already soon these days, so i can record them all onto minidiscs to bring back to taiwan. yah, these days now that mom's here, i'm not doing crazy shopping anymore so i haven't really spent money yet! which means i can go buy albums! whee~~ h
