cook the turkey on Thanksgiving, the same barbeque we taught the sun how to start so that we can grill when we get home.   At some point I think I realized that maybe he doesn’t like his wife, I mean all this time outside, maybe he doesn’t get along with her, and he’s keeping his sanity.  Maybe he just likes to be alone; maybe idle hands are the devil’s workshop.   And am I annoyed by all of this you ask?  No, intrigued is the word for it.  I watch with amusement, and I look forward to Saturday, because I am sure that this will continue.  So with a mixture of all of this and the fact that he has no Oak trees, his yard is better than mine… maybe I will water the lawn again tonight…
OK, so I haven’t been the best blogger in the world.  I mean I had originally set up a blog as kind of my journal, and it turned into a political rant about the convention.  So maybe I will leave that other blog alone.  I will wait until the RNC comes around and rant about that too.   This spot I will reserve for me.  My place to make daily thoughts come to life by putting them on paper…  My place to keep a journal, my place to write down what’s happening in my life, my place to jot down thoughts and then be able to reflect on them...   I was never good at keeping a journal because I always felt you had to hand write it and the first time my hand cramped I just felt as if I didn’t need that hand cramp and so I quit.  So I guess I will be more likely to keep up with this blog, this rant of mine, this place to put the happenings of my life, my thoughts.   I’ve been inspired because I have been reading other people’s blogs, seeing just how dedicated they all are, and I figure, what the heck I can share this with people too.  I’ll try to keep the politics on that blog, and my daily happenings on this blog.  Besides where has the time gone?  I mean the days have flown by since I last blogged, and I think it is because I didn’t know what to write next. I have always felt that journaling should just be the free flow of writing that spews forth when you clear your mind, and that other blog became something I really sat down and thought about.   I want a spot where I can have diarrhea of the keyboard, and just let things flow.  So here goes, what ends up here nobody knows, except I hope no politics ends up here, that’ll be saved for my other blog.   So what about me?  I am 25, happily married and have a dog.  That’s about it for me.  Big plans for the married, dog owner/homeowner…  Cut the grass, yes this is my exciting life for Tuesday.  Wait till you hear about my exciting life for W
