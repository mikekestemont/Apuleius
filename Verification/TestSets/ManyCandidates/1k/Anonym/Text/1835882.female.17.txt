to a site that use to take awhile to load like kcci.com but now it loads way faster.   yesterday i got my paycheck...its was 180$ and some odd cents. i worked last nite for like 3 hrs then matt was like do you want to go home so i left. lately i've been getting off an hour or two early. last nite was completely dead though....we had n/t to do so we'd stock cups and stuff. there were only like 8 or so of us working last nite so we had to take over two tasks. i presented and did drinks for drive-thru which is ok on a really slow until you get a slow rush of ppl then it sucks but yeah anywho i'll write about my 4th later and now ima gonna go.
