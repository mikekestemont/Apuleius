Microsoft. Okay- maybe they would. I find that Apple stuff are simply too expensive for my liking. I mean the price, of course. Not the hardware.  One more thing- I hate the trackpad on Powerbooks. Its either too sentive of insensitive. I've played with Mw's and my sis's best friend's Powerbook and both Powerbook's trackpad were so so so SO hard to use. And i find it hard to use Mac with only one button on the mouse.  Yeah, so the first Apple product that I think I would get would be the iPod 20GB and stick to my ol' Compaq computer.
I topped two test papers. Woohoo! And the best thing was, I got both papers on the same day.  I've basically done a websearch through Yahoo! to see whether Enfresdezh is original. Pretty original, judging that Yahoo and MSN yield no search results. I know this does not prove that the nick is 100% not taken other than Pak Nian himself.  Mw wants me to submit my journal to her. My guess: She wants to know where I've went or why. Of course, I may be wrong, she may just want to know how I've been doing. Judging by what I wrote in my previous entry.  Oh yes. MW told me to change the seating plan. Again. But the seating plans are seldom effective for most teachers. Accept for one- Verily Tan. VT went on with her lame talk again.

When Potassium is added to water. One of VT's ideas.
Alright. Seems that I've missed a lot of action in my absence. Mw sent one SMS on Thurs and another on Fri. Well, I had to spend money to reply her. If not later she go and make police report...  I've done an overall review of the Century Mahkota Hotel (Melaka): Room: (+) Big (-) not clean anough (+) house-like (-) toiletries not complete (ie. no face towel, no glasses in the bathroom) (+) got curtains (-) leaky taps  Hotel: (+) Bell- boy (-) no cyber cafe (+) quiet (-) no transportation (+)much sports facilities (-) compound too large  There are eight blocks in all, each named after a flower. plant. whatever. My hotel room was a family apartment, with two bedrooms and two bathrooms. My bathroom had nothing other than 2 towels. Which explains the "no glass in the bathroom". The worst part was, when my father and I led the way and saw the small print under the "Century Mahkota Hotel".. I nearly wanted to stop there and turn around. It wrote: "Wholly owned by Ayer Keroh Resorts Sdn Bnd."  UH-OH. Ayer Keroh. That name made me recall all the bad memories I had at Ayer Keroh D' Village, one of Ayer Keroh's resorts at Ayer Keroh. But the stay at Melaka was okay. The bedsheets were clean anough, after all. No kidding- Ayer Keroh is a real p
