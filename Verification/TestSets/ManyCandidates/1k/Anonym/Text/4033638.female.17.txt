. Very worth it to go and see what we've done. Not much is up, but you can still check it out. Anway, things have been going good...my dad finally went back to work, so he's not hanging around the house anymore and annoying us. Also, that means more money coming in so we'll be able to buy groceries and school supplies. I don't know if I'm going to like having him home every night, but he is going to have more time to do his music, which will mean that he'll be out of the house and away from us. I know it sounds so horrible to say that about my dad, but...it's the truth. ~Truth is stranger than fiction~ -Don't know
What happens when you hate yourself And wish that would die? All because of what I did and the look within your eye I cannot make you happy You've forgotten how to smile I often wonder why you're here What makes it all worthwhile You hate me  For what I say...  And I deserve it.  Why can't I stop fucking up with Alyson? Every time I tease or say something...it always makes her mad and she ignores me...like she's doing now. I hate myself...hate myself for hurting her. Why can't I just say the right thing, the things that don't agitate and annoy her? Almost&nbsp;a year, and I haven't learned. How sad is that?
I got my license finally! God, it felt so good receiving it finally. I like driving a lot...Alyson swears I'm going to get tired of it, but I think it's relaxing. Now, I just have to learn how to drive the Saturn, and then it shall be mine. Having my license marks (at least for me) that I have freedom and can start to do things on my own. Once I have the car in my possession, I'm going to get a job and make money, as well as start going places, regardless of what my parents say. I'm tired of being caged, tired of being treated like the parent instead of the kid. I want to be reckless, irresponsible, and not give a fuck for once. I want to lean over and kiss Alyson in front of them, then walk out and say, "There you go" but that is going a bit far lol. I don't know...I'm just so tired of having no freedom whatsoever. Or the money to do anything. Thanks to my father, I can't get new school clothes like I had hoped this weekend because he doesn't want to get off his lazy ass and get a job. Now, my mom has more to worry about and he just bitches and complains that there is no money or anything. I would help out if I could, but I have to sit at home. Hopefully, I'll be able to get that job at Vianne's and I'll be able to have some money. *sighs* Who knows? ~"I've been to hell, young man...you've only read about it" -Geoffery Rush as Marquee de Sade in "
