vegetarianism/veganism, anti-corporate politics, and non-gmo/organic food lifestyle. i don't say "renewed" my faith in these things, because i never dropped out of all of those things completely. but it makes my drive towards these goals much stronger.   then, as i'm scoping out the scene to dodge into Fahrenheit 9/11, i see the girl who took my ticket to get into Supersize Me...ACK! and when she took my ticket it was the kind of thing where you both notice each other, cuz we're both some funky chicks. so this is what happened:  she: "hey, what was the movie you just saw?" me: "Supersize Me" she: "cool, whaddya think?" me: "i thought it was fucking awesome" she: "have you seen Fahrenheit 9/11" me: "no, actually, i was just sitting here about to sneak into it." she: "uhh...it's pretty crowded in there..." me: "i'm by myself so...is it cool if i go in?" she: "sure, i won't tell anyone...yer lucky i'm in a good mood" me: "SWEEET...THANKS."  DAMNIT! that's AWESOME. when you just let shit flow, it goes. that's really all the sense i can make of it. life is grand.   and on the way out, there are people with clipboards, signing-up people to vote. now THAT, is a REALLLY good idea. dubya needs to go buh-bye.  then, on the train home, i'm sitting there, evading the glances of strangers, cuz that seemed to be the thing that everyone else was training for, and this big black dude sitting behind me grabs my wrist and sez, "what's this on yer hand?" now, i don't immediately freak out when people grab me, unless they are trying to tickle me, trying to hurt me, or a police officer. so i didn't freak out when he grabbed me, i just said, "oh, those are notes." (and they were notes, i wrote down some things i wanted to remember from the movies i had just seen.) so he puts down my wrist and sez, "i used to think that people who had hair like you were crazy." to which i replied, "what made you change yer mind?" he said, "when i saw you." then i thought, wow, that's cool....this dude is drunk. and that's weird, cuz immediately after i have this thought, he sez, "oh-and don't think i said that cuz i'm drunk. but i am drunk." wow. neat. then we had a conversation about the gay bar he was going to, and how to pull the ladies and the boyz, and then he asks me to go to the club with him. uhhh...well, i was thinking about it, and then i thought harder about how sober i've been the last few months, and i think i really wanted to go but my mouth just blurted out a "no." which was another really good thing, because while he's walking out of the train with his open container of beer, he walks right into a pair of police officers. and this dude was only 18.   did i mention, ladies and gentleman, that the saudis have us by the b
