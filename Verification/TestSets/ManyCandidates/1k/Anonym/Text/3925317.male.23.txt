yesterday when the heat index was around 112 or so.  Still, his stupidity amazes me.  I, serving as the office pee-on, which I guess is appropriate since I'm wasting valuable office time writing this shite, was doled the task of clearing his calendar of apppointments.  Well, let me tell you just how easy it is to clear a calendar that consists only of times and first names.  I'm apparently meant to have intimate knowledge of everyone in this office.  But, um, no.  This is especially true given the fact that there are three guys in the office (including me) and then six girls.  That limits my potential "I  would  like to know you intimately factor to two of eight.  But OH MY GOD, no.  Upon seeing these guys, everyone would understand my repulsion.  So, that's my first example of human stupidity, Mr. Lazypants who is a near perfect example of this trait.  Secondly, I just have to point out how stupid, and I mean flat out and verifiably stupid, conservatives are.  As I write this, the US Senate is debating the merits (none) and demerits (all) of the proposed constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage.  As the media, whom I don't trust, have reported, this amendment is justly doomed to fail.  Who in their right mind would believe that permitting same-sex couples to wed could be so manifestly detrimental to merit an amendment?  We have, if I'm not mistaken, twenty-four amendments to our constitution.  With the exception of the eighteenth (which enacted prohibition), none have limited our civil liberties.  Furthermore, the eighteenth was such a hideous failure that the twenty-first amendment had the sole purpose of repealing the eighteenth altogether.  The twenty-first did not even leave any limits on age or intoxication or anything.  These matters have been defined only afterwards through individual states.  Even then, the federal government has managed to push its policies through the incentive of federal highway funds.  Without the twenty-one year age limit, states get no funding.  Louisiana, until recently, had done without such funds and allowed eighteen year-olds to drink.  Can we imagine a time when the federal government denies highway funding to Massachusetts based on its ability to see truth?  One would hope not.  That would establish a nation in which the bass-ackwards states (like Idaho, Texas, Utah, Alabama, etc.) tolerate only straight WASPs (white, Anglo-Saxon, Protestants) but have good roads.  And one in which forward-thinking states (like Massachusetts, New York, California, Oregon, etc.) have impassable roads but tolerate the masses.  Since the amendment is doomed to fail (as is, I am sure, the entire anti-gay-rights movement), this is not a possible future.  Still, it serves quite well to highlight the pure stupidity that is conservatism.  Here, I'd like to add the caveat that fiscal conservatism is not my beef here.  While I disagree with most fiscal conservatives, because I feel that their system benefits only the rich, I do not feel they are dumb.  They simply have a different, yet valid, outlook.  Social conversatives, meanwhile, are just bible-bangers, unable to think for t
