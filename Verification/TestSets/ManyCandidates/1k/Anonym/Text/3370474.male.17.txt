a fucking mental breakdown.&nbsp; How would you feel if people disrespected you and spat on you any chance they got?   Its not everyday that I get to sit down and chat.&nbsp; But now I am.&nbsp; And unless someone lets me in, helps me, I might send all this madness upon society.   Im holding my breath.   Sitting with death.   He listens, he always listens.   And I swear, when I blow my brains out, everyones going to hear me now.   &nbsp;  Why do I keep breathing? I look ahead, trying to figure out why I am aloud to carry on.   Death please take me, you listen to me, please dont close your arms to me.&nbsp; I need you.&nbsp; Embrace me.... Take me.... Release me of all this pain....   &nbsp;  "I Can't remember her face"  "No one&nbsp;can take her place"
I am back to feeling how I felt around a year ago.&nbsp; Depression is sinking in faster than when the twin towers went down.&nbsp; I don't feel as if I can take this anymore.&nbsp; I don't feel as if she cares about me anymore.&nbsp; Anytime I make reference to being depressed, she brushes it off or does nothing to help me.&nbsp; Yet if someone else tells her they are depressed, then they get so much attention, she cares about them.&nbsp; I'm sick and tired of being second and being a no one to her.&nbsp; If things don't change in the coming weeks, I will take my life.   &nbsp;  As an old philosopher once said, "To live is to die and to die is to live."

I want us to go back to how we used to be, before I started to feel this way.&nbsp; I do love her, I know it, but it is not as strong as it once was, and I fear I will lose her soon.
What is death? Death is nothing more but a blessing.  Why must we all be saddened by death? Why must we all cry when someone dies?  Dry your eyes!  Know that they are now gone to a better place, whether you accept it or not.  They are away from all the terrorism, all the rapes, all the hate, and all the racisms of this world.    Like Tupac himself said, At worst, he is in a quiet place, by himself all alone.  At best… He’s an angel.  Death is so much more than you all make it seem.  Give it a second thought, a second o
