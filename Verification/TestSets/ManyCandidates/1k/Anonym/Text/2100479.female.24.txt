The last time I saw her was in Clearwater Beach, Florida, for a training session.  I am really happy to know that I am making progress, even if it is hard for me to tell.

I am down to about two options at this point, either figure out a different way to eat, or join weight watchers.  I think I may give this one more go on my own, but if I don't drop some of this fat, I am going to do the weight watcher's program.  I really want to get that stationary bike, too.  I definitely need to get more cardio into my r
