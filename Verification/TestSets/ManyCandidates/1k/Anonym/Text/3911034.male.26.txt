into almost believing they were real. The first 25 minutes is pretty crazy especially the first ten minutes I thought I wasn't going to be able to sit through the whole film the camera movements were so irratic but it does become clear why it is used. Gaspar Noe has made a basic story into something incredible. I'm surprised the Australian censorship board didn't ban this film. Considering they banned Ken Park which is play shool compared to this because it is French it probably slipped through because not many people would see it. If it wasn't for the intense 5min rape and bashing scene I would recommend this to everyone. I'm going to give this film a 10 I haven't been so disturbed by a film in a long time. Monica Bellucci is so beautiful in this, what is it with my French ladies getting treated so poorly - first Audrey now Monica!  Story: 5/5   Production: 5/5   Film: 10/10

Made an appearance in a one minute video we filmed in my Advanced Digital Video class today. I was surprised I actually took on the role with no apprehension. Of course it was a small role but we did the majority of the filming in front of atleast one hundred students coming and going to their classes. I'll post some pics from the film tomorrow.
After 8 years at Arsenal, Pat Vieira looks likley to set sail to Spain in search of Champions League glory with Real Madrid. Arsenal may lose their captain and best central midfielder but considering he missed about a quarter of last season and the Gunners were still undefeated Arsenal have shown they can cope with such a big loss. No hard feelings towards "La Grande Saucisse" regardless of what happens over the next couple days. In a time of mercenary players he and most of Arsenal have stuck together through good and bad. Good luck Vieira, just don't take Henry with u next season!
Had some free time after Uni today so I went and had a look at the Chronicles of Riddick. Bit of a weird film but I always am interested in sci-fi films. The overall appearance of the film was pretty spectacular. The effects were very top notch especially the external scenes on the various planet surfaces with there different atmospheres. The space ships were done very realistically with heat distorting the surroundings. Vin Diesel was his normal robot self. The story was a bit slow at first but then started rolling along nicely but sort of stopped suddenly and left issues unresolved. I could of done with another half hour to be fully satisfied. More disappointing was the similarities to other films like Dune, The Mummy, Pitch Black and The Matrix. Story: 2/5   Production: 4/5   Film: 6/10
