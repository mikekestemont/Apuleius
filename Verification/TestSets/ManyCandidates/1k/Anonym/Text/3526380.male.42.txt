breaking.  But if they are utilized for something they are not suited for, they will eventually break.
So, let me ask a question...  When are you the happiest?  I was thinking about this today for some reason.  It may have had something to do with the fact that I was on my way to work, which is an event that often provokes these kind of questions.  More about that later.    For me, there is not a single answer.  For example, I am happiest when I am with my wife just hanging out, having dinner together, breakfast, going someplace together, watching a video, etc. She's cool and I like hanging out with her. I feel very lucky to have a friend like her around.  I am also happiest when I am in my pool just lounging around, having a drink.  I don't know why, but that really relaxes me.  Just floating and relaxing.  I spent the better part of Memorial Day just floating in my pool lounger with a drink ( urlLink margarita ) in one hand and a good book ( urlLink Lonesome Dove ) in the other.   I am also happiest when I am traveling (for pleasure, not business!).  Especially if it involves the great outdoors or a national park ( urlLink Big Bend National Park  is a great example).  I really like the outdoors and hiking and stuff like that.  Not that I'm any good at it. But I still like it.  As I mentioned earlier, I've been reading  urlLink Lonesome Dove  by Larry McMurtry.  One of the characters in the book, Gus, told another character, Lorena, that if all you have to look forward to is one big thing in life that you think will make you happy, you are likely to be disappointed.  He said that, instead, you have to be happy with the little everyday things in life.  That way, you are always around something or doing something that makes you happy.  I'm trying to learn to do that more.  So, when are YOU the happiest?
What drives a person to want to post their musings and random thoughts to the entire internet world (or at least the one or two people who may stumble across it by complete accident)?  I have no fecking idea.  But nonetheless, here I am.  I should be working.  But, WTF.  Here I am.  What drives people to Blog?  Most that I have seen seem to be driven by depression, desparation, the need to express their feelings, frustration, the need to express political views, passions about their interests, perhaps describe a situation in which they currently find themselves.  Me?  All of the above, I guess.  And none of the above.  I shouldn't be here.  I should be confidently pursuing my career, goals, and dreams.  But here I am.  Why?  I have no fecking idea.  Yet here I am.  Must be a reason.  Something deep.  Mysterious.  Or even completely pointless.  Probably something I haven't even figured out yet.   More to come soon, for those of you just hanging on the edge of your s
