 rrr...  So anyway, I'm quite gosh darn happy right now, due to the fact that I am able to go to a Pirates game on Friday! w00t!  Ya know, Pittsburgh Pirates, the baseball team?  The one that frickin'   loses   every game??? Oh well...fun anyway.    Go see Spider-Man 2.  I've seen it five times in theaters and I'm going with my friends come Saturday to see it again.    I love Spider-Man! urlLink Robespierre
This country is a mess.  I wrote this letter to Michael Moore, filmmaker extraordinaire.     Mike...  My name is Catherine Rutkowski, and although I am only 16, the state of the American nation, as revealed in your brilliant movies "Bowling For Columbine" and "Fahrenheit 9/11", is deeply distressing.  I had no idea things of this terrible nature are occurring every single day, example children shooting other children, and actors/NRA presidents not caring, despite their fervent and somewhat fanatical toting of the second amendment.  You were fully correct in Bowling:  where are all the reporters asking questions about why you can't see the Hollywood Hills, and why do the reporters go for the gun instead of the drowning child?  We are a nation of bullet-loving psychopaths, sorry as it is for me to say.  But still, we always live *happily ever after*, sung to the tune of the animated family, each with their own well-loved firearm.   Not that I'm saying children with little toy guns is wrong!!!  Both my brother and I played guns and army almost daily in our younger days (my brother is 13), but still! The cold-bloodedness cannot in any way be blamed on a first grader pointing a chicken strip at his teacher and saying "Pow, you're dead."  I now take an example from 1971's "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory".  If you would recall, there are several scenes where a television-loving child named Mike Teevee whips out a toy Colt .45 and shoots the television set.  Skip to a second scene approximately 15 minutes later.  Mike again has his gun at hip, and upon meeting Mr. Wonka, dramatically extracts his pistol, thrusts it into the stomach of Mr. Wonka as portrayed by Gene Wilder, and shouts, "Wham! You're dead!"  Shocking, isn't it, that in this age of "protecting the fragile psyches" of our nation's youth, where such dangerous individuals as first-graders and their fast-food lunches get indicted by the school board with shocking frequency, can watch one of their peers pretend to cut down a man in a purple coat so carelessly?  It is surprising to me that this has not been edited out of the movie when it airs on TV.  Mr. Moore, if this email has become too drawn out, I apologize.  I simply wanted to state my likeness of opinion with you after having viewed Bowling for Columbine for the first time last night and finding it to be excellent: humorous, informative, eye-opening, and sobering all at the same time.  Please continue your excellent work.  I support you 100 percent.  Respectfully yours,  Catherine Rutkowski Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania     Am I not right?  America the sickening...   c
