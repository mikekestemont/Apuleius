This week I bought Doom 3. This is the most anticipated game of the year. Although i only bought it to get my hands on last years game of the year Star wars: the knights of the old rebublic. Neways back to doom 3. This game is really freaky, the opening has u walking thru this base on mars with practically no light ( You would guess that by the time we could get to mars there would be some forms of lighting). But anyways as u are walking down this long set of rooms and partof the outside of mars u finally get to this room with a crazy scientist.  This guy babbles on about how he has seeen the devil and how he created a cage for him.  Then all of a sudden there is a warning and stuff just starts blowing up. Then all of a sudden these things start flying around the room and pass thru this scientist. Then remarkably he becomes a zombie and starts attacking u. its really freaky because at first u dont know wut the heck is happening to you.  As u progress back down the halls it gets freakier because u cand hold ur gun and light at the same time.  So when u put ur light on to see the zombies u can see them but as soon as u take out ur gun ur only light (your flashlight goes back into the big old inventory sack). Now u are shooting at a enemy u can barely see. This is really freaky. Luckly no one is black so u can see thier white heads.  So if ur looking for a really good horror game buy Doom 3  late,  Smog
Lately I havn't posted anything on my blog, this is for all that cared or even noticed (this means the all one of you).  Anyways this week i have beenso busy that i just had no time to post. I have been at a hockey school all week long. For those who are thinking why are you in a HOCKEY SCHOOL IN THE MIDDLE OF SUMMER !  Well I'm dont know why us canadians do such crazy things but we do. Plus the hockey season starts in two weeks with the start of training camp. Back on the crazy Canadian thing well Canadians are just friggin crazy when it come to hier kids and our national sport of hockey.  The hockey camp was in Toronto and i was in Oakville. (for those who dont live in this area some days it took an hour and forty minutes to get to the rink.  Then during the week I had to help my dad with some technical issues at work the key one being a presentaion to Universal Studios. I had to make the presentation that one of the employees really goofed up on.  Anyways if you wanted to know why i havent posted this is why  Lates,  S
