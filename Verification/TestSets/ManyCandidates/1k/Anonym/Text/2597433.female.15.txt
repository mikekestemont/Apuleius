work in a couple of hours, and when I got off I knew he'd be at work   he gets off at 10   so.. I'm trying so hard to not lose my mind thinking about everythings that happened   it's so hard to swallow   i love it when he calls me pretty   i know it's not really true   but he thinks he means it   and i love it   i love being with him      the whole day has been one big haze   i quit my job   they never gave me my raise   i stop going on aug 13   i opened a door on my face today   it hit me hard   there's actually a poofed up line on my face   i might have a concussion   i had such a bad day at work   but it doesnt matter   i just want to see him tonight   he better ask me out   i can't really imagine it getting any better than this   this is..   amazing.      a couple things have been bothering me.   1. when he came over the night before last he mentioned this girl taking him out after work. was it romantic? are they friends? i'll have to ask him   2. when did he decide to start thinking i'm beautiful! i've been waiting forever but i think i'll be devastated if he just realized not too long ago that he likes me.. like, he's only liked me for a day and.. yeah. Just because I've been hurting for him for so long I don't want to think he just suddenly picks me up without all the hurt and wanting and.. oh, fuck it. I'm so happy. So's Judy. She loves Stuart. I just told her that he likes me. She was so happy for me.   3. Stuart smokes. I'm going to try the very best I can to get him to stop. I don't like it at all. I kinda kicked his cigarettes under my couch and he said, "Oh, just what you want your parents to find." "I'd rather have them in my basement than in your pocket." He said that was sweet, lifted up my chin again and kissed me.      God, I love being with him. It's so different - us making out compared to Marc and I. Stuart holds me so close...      Everyone is so happy for me. And jealous. They all think we make the perfect couple.   The best thing? Stuart knows EVERYTHING about me. Cutting, fighting family, pill popping me. Well, that's all in the past.. well, the things that I can control are in the past now. He likes me anyway. We have 6 years of friendship behind us.. we'll be great.   Well.. once he asks me out..   and he better.      FAQ -   What does David think?   David doesn't know, David probably won't care. He should be happy for me though, he knows how long I've liked Stuart and has respected me for not being flaky and knowing what I want.      Wow. i need to calm down. I'm way too happy.       He kisses me on the top of the head        .
