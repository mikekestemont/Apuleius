on earrings. she immediately tears intot he packaging and puts them on, batting her eyelashes at him. accompaning that was a perfect gift since her recent accident.  "he's so perfect," she thinks.  she is elated, walking on air. it has been too long that someone has taken such care and proved to know her so well as he did, on this day. she hugs and kisses him while he drives, almost climbing on top of him with driving down the road.  he takes her to a caf√© for breakfast, a spot known for good food and friendly waitresses. she doesn't take her crown off. the entire breakfast is full of innuendo after innuendo. she placing her barefooted toes in his lap, curling them in just the right places. the sunny elderly waitress inquires about a special day, after all, how many 27 year olds do you see walking in for breakfast with a bright shiny crown on.  "it's my birthday," the woman replies.  "oh wonderful! happy birthday! you have many special things plan today, i hope!" she says, eyeing the two of them as if they were a "real couple".  the woman grins at her male counterpart, "i hope so!"  after the gift of the death by chocolate brownie with a candle in it from the waitress, they leave, hand in hand, thanking the eldery woman every so much by leaving a very nice tip. they spend the day as normal couples do, lauging, talking, cuddling and kissing. only, they have limited time during the day to see each other. he must make excuses and lie, where she can't tell her friends one word of the truth. she spends her day, holding his hand, burning the memory into her head since she knows, one day, one of them will grow sick of the lies. she hopes it will be herself first. rejection from any lover is hard, but from a married man, well, it feels harder than anyone else, ever.  she moves his hand up her leg inch my inch as they get closer to her apartment after the full day. silently, he follows her inside to her couch and sits down with her, taking her face in his hands and kissing her so deeply that she didn't even hear his phone ring.  "your wife?"  "give me a minute."  she leaves the room as he talks on the phone for a bit, giving him privacy. he comes to her, wraps his arms around her and says,  "i have to go. i thought we would have had a few more hours. i am sorry."  she nods, not looking at him in the face. when he leaves, he half-heartedly kisses her again, knowing it can't make up for the injury caused.  "i will make it up to you, i promise."  so much time has passed and she is still waiting.
