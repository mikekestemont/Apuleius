posted, but im here. looking for work, doing work, and trying to find a job is consuming all my time. anyways, ill check in more later, and try to keep this more up to date.
working, watching fireworks, working, playing, driving. Went to mobile this weekend, had a job offer down there, thought i would check it out. seems ok, just worried about moving, and kids, and nieghborhoods, and school districts, and finding places, and changing doctors, and all that jazz. but hey, i guess if it works out that way, it works out. job is...ok, its for a national magazine, and i have a potential to learn print design there, which would be nice. i know layout and such, but learning inks and fonts and print etc would be cool. just makes me nervous i guess. on other fronts, ghost is doing well, we are moving along, we just hope to get it out soon, its looking good though, so we have our fingers crossed. Montgomery had thier fireworks display, christ you know there is nothing to do in this town, downtown montgomery looked like new york on the blackout, people were everywhere, it was insane. the display, it was ok i guess, fuck, its fireworks. :) the rest, is blah, even for this blog so ill spare you. :)
Google has updated Gmails Terms of Service on Monday, prohibiting users from engaging in commercial activities with their Gmail invitations. Apparently, Google is not very happy with all the Gmail invitations that were being sold accross the Internet and has decided to put an end to this officially.   The new policy reads Sell, trade, resell or otherwise exploit for any unauthorized commercial purpose or transfer any Gmail account, will likely spelled the end for biddings of Gmail invitations on eBay and Internet forums. Although users can now no longer sell these invitations, I believe that the endless the Gmail queue requests will continue until either everybody has got an account, or they eventually lose interests, or Gmail becomes publically opened. Until which ever one of those happened, expect more GIVE ME GMAIL! to come.   Best thing they could have done. :)
Man its been a while since the last time i did this. Been working my ass off, and doing the game, havent had time for a update lately, but ill try to stay more current. My blog is about absolutely nothing, so lord knows who reads it, they never leave comments if they do, so i might be doing this for my own amusment. Anyways, just got done watching Penn & Tellers BullShit. What a excellent show, it doesnt get much better than that.  In other news, still without a job and doing freelance, which has picked up, but i still want to work somewhere. im applying in the Dallas area, so hopefully that will pan out soon. As far as the game goes, still have animator trouble, and its going so slow, we need to move on so bad. well, ill try to stay more current, if anyone missed me. :
