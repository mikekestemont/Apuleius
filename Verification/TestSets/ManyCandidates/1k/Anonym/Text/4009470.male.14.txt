Bear  said, "Were you the one who slept in my bed?" She replied yes and got married, and lived happily ever after.      Okay, after this, we have a round of Scrabble in which I am so lucky to place all seven tiles onto the board and score 81 points! ( HAHA !) I and some other classmates (pardon the grammar) watch Shakespeare in Love which is quite touching and how his love life inspired him to compose Romeo and Juliet and Twelfth Night. It is an enjoyable day today!!!          WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS ARTICLE/REFLECTION? DO COMMENT AND REPLY TO THIS POST!   COPYRIGHT © 2004 LEVIATHAN DREAMERS    ALL RIGHTS RESERVED
4th August 2004          Today, we have inter-house  cross-country  competition at MacRitchie Reservoir Park which is a 4.8 kilometre run. For me, I have to be a  road marshal  and together with Guo Cong, Shan Hui, Mark Yeow and Kian Wee, we stand at a spot for  about 1.5 hours  seeing people run past us rather than doing our duty (slack rite?). By the way, I think the runners know where to run and we are just  some statues  breaking the monotony of the blanket of green in the park. We break the boredom by playing a game called " The Three Word Game ", in which one person will continue the story using only three words (punctuation marks not counted)           For example:              I see two ...              You can continue the story by adding three words, for example, "boys walking down", "chio bu talking" and so on ... until you will get a very lame, stupid story. It can be sexist, racist, vulgar, porn etc. as long as you use three words to continue the story. Here's one example (the different colours represent different people writing:                I see two   chio bu doing   tai chi in   a really noobish   manner ...            So we spend one hour on an essay something similar to this. We also cheer for classmates Norman and Yi Jing as they zoom past us in the top five positions.  It is glad to hear that they end up second and third respectively and the top three runners for Sec 2 category are from my house!!! This shows that our house stands a good chance as the overall champion house for this year...            At the end of this job, our heels get so tired that our legs feel like breaking and we seriously need to drink and rest. Basically it is kind of pathetic to watch people run and wearing half-uniform with a beret under the hot sun ... and the seniors (thanks to Choo Yee Sin) say that the  milo is not for us when it is open for all ...
