of self-reflection for the past week on my other  urlLink blog . But I'm done with that now, so lets get back to updating this blog. =)  If you want to know more about yourself, try answering a few  urlLink Tickle Tests .  Formerly Emode, Tickle has a lot of tests to help you reveal your subconscious mind, your IQ and your personality. Signing up is required but free. Be sure to try the inkblot test!  I still remember the DOS program I used in high school, Dr. Shrink. You rate a virtue, emotion or characteristic between 1-5, with 1 not likely and 5 very often. For example: Patience - 1 2 3 4 5 There was also another program called Dr. Shrink that allowed you to "talk", you typed in your response, to the doctor and he will give you a diagnosis. I remember it being included in a test about language recognition programs. If the testers couldn't differentiate the computer program response from a real person's response, then the program would be considered successful.
It's been over a month since my last post. Rather than explain why, lets just say that I was "busy". Except for the new Blogger interface,  things haven't changed much. Or is it "much changed". I wonder when was this implemented. Anyway...  Guess the Blogging bug got me again. Which happens when I can't sleep or after watching Six Feet Under. The reason for this "blah" of a post goes to the latter.   Several things caught my attention during the 2-hour season 3 finale. Like how Nate used sex to fill a void, just like Brenda did. Here's one reason I find the show "frustrating". The sex scene with Nate got me aroused, but right after that, they showed the scene of David "getting it on" with another guy. I find it funny that I can be easily "turned on or off". Pathetic, eh?  Moving on to deeper issues, like how Claire decided to get the abortion. I haven't made up my mind yet regarding that issue, but could you blame Claire for deciding to go through with it? The scary thing was how the women were being processed, like going through a factory production line. That episode can be described in one word: COLD.  Good thing that this was a two hour thing, or I'd sleep depressed.  The next episode can also be descibed in one word: HOPE. Hope for David and Keith's relationship. Hope and closure for Claire. I can't remember if her ex O.D. or something. I found that scene comforting with Claire talking to her father, her ex, Lisa and her aborted baby. Would it be nice to see and interact with your departed love ones like that and not like that fucking scary movie the "Sixth Sense". I found Rico's infidelity and the new hubby to be an interesting development in the story. Can't wait for the 4th season to start.  Guess I'll have to force myself to watch the final season of Sex and the City for the mean t
