decided I don't care about my evaluation reports, he can't take my rank away (I wish he would, though, honestly), and I sense that if the shit hit the fan and everything came out, he'd be relieved of command.  Bring it on , you caustic, pompous, bitter, nihilistic piece of shit.    And to put the icing right up on the cake? My fellow lieutenant, Shayla, the one I've always had mixed feelings about but had decided to get along with at all costs? Has stabbed me in the back several times now. I can't even look at her. Any slim chance we might be friends is forever lost.  However, I must be doing something right because the Colonel, the Big Boss, publicly speaks very highly of me. As does his deputy commander, a Lieutenant Colonel. I brief them and the rest of the Brigade Staff every day, and I do it well.  I'm good at my job. I just don't  like  it much right now.
It's 10pm, I've been here since 5:30am, with no end in sight. It's been this way for over a week. I'm so sleep-deprived, I hallucinated on the walk home last night. A piece of white toilet paper fluttering on the ground became a serpent. Albino, I suppose, but a serpent nonetheless. I jump and yelped. I'm glad no one was around.  Actually, I was even  more  glad no one was around to witness my stress-induced tantrum moments later in the shower. Having worked that insane schedule for many days in a row, I can't exactly remember when my last shower took place. I'm thinking it was three days prior. But last night, I reached my filth threshold and sacrificed a half-hour of sleep for a shower. So imagine how pissed I was when I reached for the knobs, naked, shampoo in hand, and there was  no water.      I cursed. I threw things. Slammed doors. Then went about fixing the problem...threw switches in the fuse box, turned knobs on the pump, still naked as a jaybird and not giving a tinker's damn. And finally, something went right and the pump started working.  I was still pissed, though, and muttered furiously all through the shower and kept it up stomping back to my room.  There's nothing wrong with me that a full night's sleep wouldn't fix. I'm only able to keep this blog updated because the Boss isn't around and we finally have an unclassified computer in the Dungeon.  I miss my queen-sized sleigh bed with the fine sheets and thick down comforter. I miss the ceiling fan's sweet breeze. I miss waking up to sunlight in the room and the sound of traffic outside the Park where I live. I miss my kitchen. And the front porch with the cheap chairs I bogarted from Dad's house that actually look great and are quite comfortable when you pull one up to the railing, put your feet up, and read for the late afternoon as the cats chase each other on the front lawn. I just plain miss  home .
