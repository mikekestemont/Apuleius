then, I spin songs waiting in your place. Flowers will wash their smells among the villians of your soul freshening your ego to make sense of the day.  Stopping not for a quarter or a little maid as a servant bound by the culture we so ignorant create.  A life shining and sedate, soft and real too late to relate soft and real so far to date.  Stripes in black so bountiful make men spin. Her lines-of-best-fit are of zen and why not for Mary for you and I are getting scary  And so full of romance, they dance among the toilets and sinks of sin, and I stand waiting for a song, a verse that's not wrong but lazy today, I say I'm a new corker any other day  -collaboration with pett, 2004
Just got home from a night out with 2 friends here in Toronto.  Barry is one of the good old boys. He's in the mix with a new girl named Amber who is 23 and he thinks he likes her. I met her.  She is nice. He drank vodka.  Dave, is married and has been with Michelle for 11 years.  Dave is from age 15, we played baseball together. He was a pitcher who used to get stressed on the mound, but could throw smoke. I know this.  He may forget.  He's a close friend. He is going to Journalism school soon. He drank vodka and then finished with a beer, and left first.  Only barry and I danced.  I boogied down and looked like the beaver. (Dave wrote on beer coasters with a green pen)  I liked getting down, solo with the funk being played at Ciao Edie, a Toronto bar. Noticed no one else and had a good time.  I drank vodka until I was sober.  Now, I am going to have a cup of tea and some peanut butter on italian bread. It is 3:43.
