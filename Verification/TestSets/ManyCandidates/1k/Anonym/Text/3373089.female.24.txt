else I was born with a name..my father had given it to me..Amritarupa Banerjee...In an age where Adnan becomes Ady,Sandeep becomes sandy,Tejaswy becomes Teju or Pooja becomes Poo..I had never ever hoped that ppl would address me by my first name..Amritarupa..it was shortened to Amrita..Well i really like the name Amrita..It sounded simple,nice n I was pretty happy about the fact that now people would spell and pronounce it right..Just Amrita..Well it was not to be..When i was in kolkata..I was addressed with that typical Bangla accent which made it sound more like Amrito..So much for being a bengali..After migrating to Pune (well literally coz i had to have my migaration cert. done) the real woes Begun..Earlier the pronunciation was a problem..here my name itself changed..Amruta Banerjee..So that was my first rechristening (1996)...When i had shifted bag n baggage to hyderabad for my grads..i was rechristened for the second time..Amritha Banerjee..Amrutha Banerjee..this generous dosage of "h"does happen down south..Swati becomes swathi,Jyoti becomes Jyothi,Even Natasha (which incidentally is a russian name) is turned into Nathasha.. Now when i stare at the letter that i have received from Bangalore this morning..I feel sorry..feel sorry for my father who had so lovingly given me a name...it proudly said ..Ms Amrutha Roopa Banerjee.. And they say "Whats in a Name?".. I say..A hell lot..
Another sunday morning!!!yipee! dunno why every sunday gets me goin..never analysed it..lemme gues...........still guessing...!!! hmm..,get up late(quite a luxury..coz my college starts at 8 a.m in bangalore n here in mumbai ,i have to reach office at 9.30..which is a 2 hrs drive from home),maybe it lets me have a great breakfast while i read the newspaper(a luxury too,when the office days finds me enterin the car with slices of bread n jam in my hand ),i get to have a bath without havin to worry about my office timings (in mumbai) n college timins ( in bangalore),I get to read my unfinished novel(which is takin far too long by my standards..worried!!!)..and do all the inconsequential things which makes me happy n contended at the end of the day..I am already lookin forward to the next sunday.. :-)
E- Expected U- Upholders R- Romped O- Out   Well this is the jist of the ongoing EURO-2004.. Well maybe thats why the european championships have been considered to be one roller coaster ride!.I think it definately is.. When nearly half the football lovers thought that France will take the trophy .. And Voila!,they were defeated by a side wheich has never won any international title till date..Call it fate or call it over confidence,anything!!..I didnt mind..coz i had never liked France to begin with.. But after one of my favourites Holland crashed out this morning,I am kinda down..!!Now ,neither will i see nistelroy and his acrobatics nor robben's ball control... :-( But all is not lost ,coz my other favourite Czech Rep is still playin..and playing really well..hopefully tonight they will bulldoze the greeks and later convincingly take the EURO'04 trophy back to prague!! I am sure that Brueckner's eleven can very well do i
