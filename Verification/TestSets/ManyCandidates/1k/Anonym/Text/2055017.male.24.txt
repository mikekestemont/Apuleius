did you speak to the lone evangelical In the room of naysay thought? Might money and coffee Have played a role in the undoing Of his rightousness? Might you prey on the poor standing Citizens of night, But only for mere seconds more; The counting must subside.
Paradise   Long since suspected  Carry you force and energy propelled By water and fueled by grace; Where the tinman waits for his oil change And the poet writes from the mirror; If ever dreams passed land and sea, The folly of present tense world would wait, Through storms and wind They’d wait ‘til season’s end For the harvest of enjoyment to overwhelm Even the most archaic of characters  Ah, such dreams could carry on  Over a distant horizon
Son   Memories of a sky blue sunset long passed The eve of soul and symmetry, When love and lovers joined for tea, And formed from emptiness a being of light.  From light you grew to light you sleep, And in darkness fall sick to your own surroundings; Until breath is hard, Hard for life to defeat approaching enemy.  O Stifle of breath and stiffening of laughter Plagued seed of man and dreamscape lost, Before your welcome mat was placed And a banner hung from the corner of your world to the outside street.  Memories of a sky blue sunrise long passed The dawn of soul and symmetry; Another day to fruition comes, And in emptiness, I’ll walk the mile of a long day gone.  Forever.
Sacred Angel of Bewilderment   O say you Dark Angel to the Laughing Man, “Why not come and sing to me? Lonely soul am I tonight, And robbed of my own pride and contentment.” Laughing Man in crouched bewilderment, Noteworthy causes aside, Tells the Angel of the sacred space between soul and mind The mind of a dark and hollowed soul; The soul of a dark and hollowed mind; And answers in the black remain riddled, Riddled with laughter, and riddled with pain Until sob breaks and sky moons over; The break of day pardoned To clouds of dark night. O say you Dark Angel to the Crying Man, “How far down below? Lonely soul am I tonight, And live on, the Sacred Angel of bewilderment.”
Dare   Seizing an opportunity right, Thought but never spoken. If altogether beautiful harmonious night Could join with angels singing? Hushing mouth out of sheer pale fright With the index finger of no-wave circles. Could pry the jaws with all its might Or would silence there prevail? And to nod to the elephant in the light As he passes by this room. Dare I speak this night?
Engrossed     &nbsp;  Engrossed in time   Beyond thousands shine   On the floor of the shrine   Of the darkness fall    &nbsp;  Blessed ear enthralled   Labored love and lost brawlled   Climb the peek of the wall   In the undercrawl    &nbsp;  Save for blistery day   Give up flowers away   And in time, give to sway   Great leaves be them small    &nbsp;  Fortune tells for tonight   Hours far from daylight   Carried all with great might   To&nbsp;carriers of the fall    &
