his house yesterday.   May the spirit of the kitten rest in peace. I will pray for you.
I am really too free. I need to sit down and think. It has been sometime...I start to ask myself this question again. What am I doing? Trying to learn something for nothing or learn something to do something when I have yet to settle with what I really want to do.  It may sound stupid but I remember i got this customer that tell me you never know what you will end up doing and bring your success nearer to you. Just hang in there and think of something. Hanging in there doing nothing will not help any further.  I mean at least I did do something today but it does not seems enough to me at all.  Lost is the word? I am asking.
I never know it has been half a year already since feb. Times really flies...I am thinking of what i have done so far for the first half of the year and what I am gonna do for my already started second half. Pretty late huh? But who cares? As long as I feel good!  As usual weekend spent at Adrian and Jen place, watching movie garfield and eating then working on Sat. Then eating at Lao Pat Sat, the fatman satay is still as fantastic but damn the chicken wings really sucks big time. It isn't the same taste as I use to eat before although it is from the same stall.  That night, I had a good catch up session with my buddy. Yes Lisa...she gonna be a official air stewardess soon after her SY trip or something like that. It has been so long since I got a nice chat with her. Even though nothing much as it was pretty late as well and afraid of her BF complained about her or me.  Working? Work life isn't that good. Been pretty quiet and I still got a few more accounting entries not key in as I am too lazy plus looking at the ORANGE sky outside right now make me even more lazy. It is about to have a serious and heavy down pour. Sorry Correction as I just open the window and realised it is already down pouring. Cool! I like this kind of weather. Cool and easy for tomorrow.  It's time for me to think of something to do.  Hey btw I got a couple of photos to upload as I take it off from my class room today.... Ever see a Cisco Catalyst 2950 XLi eating "Po Chai Pills" hahahaha! I mean i got nothing better to do so i try feeding the Catalyst Switch with Po Chai Pills. I ddin really feed it of course I would have make it go down with water and burst the switch. Anyway we have a power failure while doing lessons half way with the routers.......frame relay configuration isn't as difficult as it seems after all...  Projects and Projects In terms of work I want more!! :
