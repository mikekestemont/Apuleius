that I always do This is the last smile That I'l fake for the sake of being with you {Pre-chorus:}Everything falls apart even the people who never frown eventually break down The sacrifice of hiding in a lie Everything has to end you and l soon find we're out of time to watch it all unwind The sacrifice is never knowing Why I never walked away Why I played myself this way Now I see your testing me pushes me away I've tried like you To do everything you wanted too This is the last time I'll take the blame for the sake of being with you?

cool man. i love catholic high. the school just rocks. the concert today wasnt that fantastic but it was the people who made it so sentimental and touching. saw lots of friends there like weijun, toad, tim, kp, weixuan, edz, dennis, hengqing, shizhen, and lots and lots...u guys just freaking rock! weijun brought this taiwanese guy from the imersion program to the concert. he was so quiet and sian lor. so turn off. cause he was kinda un-enthu. in the end weijun din really enjoy the concert. keith and his girl was doing *weird* stuff la! damn.  the concert was quite entertaining esp the choir one which was very creative. it's not like those traditional choir where they just stand and sing. instead the whole performance was actually a story. and they walk around, dance, action whilst singing. damn pro.  the atmosphere was very good. when we sang the peng you (friends)  and the school song. seriously i felt like crying cos all the memories just came back. lim tow wee.
