this guy, lets call him Mike who dragged us to Michigan, we met his parents, Father was very nice, the Mother was off her gord. A week later there was a tragedy, Mike's Mother had supposedly shot her husband then herself, apparently she was not well in the head. After a week of them cleaning up the mess, and my mother and I staying at Mike's Aunt's house, we moved into his parent's house. Why we did this I have no idea, my Mother can't even tell my why. So the apparation I saw was Mike's mother, she was white, see through and a few feet off of the ground, and was floating from the kitchen, where she shot her husband, into the living room area. I had talked with my Mom about the strange things going on in that house as an adult, she told me she saw the same apparation, and it scared her so bad she left with cigarette burning in an ash tray. We stayed for about a month, which was all we could handle, and moved back to Colorado Springs, where I stayed with her for 4 years afterwards, then I moved in with my Father.  I didn't really exeprience much ghostly activity with him at his house and so on, but I did encounter strange things at friend's houses and so on. I had one friend who had a shadow person in her house, everytime I would go over it would act up, do something to make sure everyone knew it was there. Like turning on toys, the TV and even music. Nothing negative became of the experiences, even though a year after being there they moved, and my friend insisted it was because of the ghosts, which weren't really ghosts but demons. I still have a hard time believing that.  As I got older more stuff began happening, especially when I moved back in with my Mom, I lived in Arizona for about a year, I only had one encounter with a ghost in Bisbee. I remember my parents took me to a bar, I was not aloud to sit at the bar because I was 14 but I could be in the bar, and have cokes and Shirley temples and so on. So I remember one time I had to go to the bathroom, and I went in and I actually heard someone coming in, and I thought it was my Mom so I started talking to it, and when I was done I got out of my stall and looked into hers and saw no one there, a few seconds later my Mom walked in and I was like how did you do that she was like did what, I told her I heard someone come in, I asked if anyone had left the bathroom, she said no, we were the only ones in the bar. I just thought it was bizarre.  Anyhow, I have more stories but I do have to go so later, and thanks for letting me introduce m
