This is pretty funny regardless of who you are going to vote for in November.
"Too many designers advocate the application of standards over the use of sensible design practice. Christian argues the case for a flexible approach to the appropriate use of standards in today's sites."
I believe highly in using web standards, but I am not dogmatic about them.
"Bad design is based on the arrogant and extremely difficult attempts to modify user behavior. Good design derives innovation from existing user behavior."
Go with the "users flow", not against it.
"Good design is problem solving and should always be presented as such. Whenever a designer (be it an interaction designer, an information designer, or a visual designer) presents a client with too many options they risk undermining their value and opening themselves up to “design by committee”. The message is “I don’t know enough about your users or goals so you pick what works best.” Now the design is in a non-designer’s hands ....  every interface designer should focus on building a reputation as a problem solver and communicating that through the language of design and business. The design medium will change, the need to solve problems will not. "

I have finally switched to  urlLink Firefox  for the time being, not so much for security concerns, but for the additional functionality it offers. The " urlLink Bookmarks Synchronizer " I find incredibly useful.
"At last -- all of this year's Star Wars Fan Film Awards finalists are in! Now the fate of this generation of Jedi filmmakers is in your hands."
There are way to many geeks out there.
"Here we attempt to bring to light those "other" facts about Michael Moore's new film "Fahrenheit 9/11". We try not to make this an opinion blog- it is a fact one. We make sure to source every post, and will either cite or link to the source of the provided fact. It is our desire to see a well-armed populous that is ready to evaluate the film from an informed perspective."
Just the facts mam ... no opinion.
"Think large screens. Multiple screens. There you'll meet Patrick Baudisch, researcher, who'll show you through the lab and give you some cool software that is designed to help with large and multiple monitors."
This a very interesting look at some of the cool UI enhancements under development within Microsoft r
