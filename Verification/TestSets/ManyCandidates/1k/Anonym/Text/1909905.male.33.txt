"Life Together" that Christian community exists simply when Christians are together.  He mentions our preoccupation (again our silly human nature) with the need to catagorize our "experience" of Christian "community" by what HAPPENS when we gather.  His argument seems to be saying that, in one sense, we cannot avoid "having Christian community" if we are believers and we are SOMEwhere together.  It has nothing to do with WHAT we DO or exactly what takes place.  When believers are together, it is Church - alive and active.    But wait!  I said, "Active"!  That's doing, not being.  Well..it is true that Christians gathered "anywhere" and dedicated to "being" who they are in Christ will yield some kind of action.  Perhaps random kind acts.  Maybe prayer for another when a need is made known in casual conversation.  What if a passage from a "secular" novel is read, revealing a deep truth about the nature of our condition and it sparks some below the surface dialogue between those who believe and those who are skeptics?  The point is:  Doing is secondary.  Being is primary.  Location is necessary, but it is not specific.  These are a couple reasons why the scenario I described in the Old town Pub (though only wishful thinking at this point) could qualify as "church" in my mind.  Of course, some might say that church history, including the NT church experience as recounted in Acts should model for us what church is to be.  I think I disagree.  The history of the church and the sheer breadth and number of different expressions of the Christian church argues for cultural expression of church rather than set models upon which we must lean.  I read recently, one theologian who postulated that the Lord's Supper or Communion or the Eucharist might have only been meant for one time.  A visual/tangible lesson during a teachable moment between Jesus and his disciples.  Of course if this is the case,  it couldn't necessarily hurt to copy this action and make it into a ritual - especially one so full of meaning and so helpful to keeping us on track "until He comes".    Now, this is pretty radical, and I'm not ready to agree with this idea.  However, the thought leads to others regarding what other historical acts of the church may we have turned into lasting rituals or patterns for copying, when in fact they were simply the cultural expression of the church of the day.  After all, when I find myself or someone else saying it would be nice to return to the NT church, the thought sometimes creeps into my mind that maybe those things were good for the NT church, but not necessarily for the NM (new millennium) church.  Maybe "returning" to the church of Acts or Corinthians or Ephesians wouldn't be as dandy as we sometimes think it would.  They had a lot of issues.  My hope is that the church I am present with will understand points 1) and 2) and not feel bound to "cultural" forms, even when they appear in S
