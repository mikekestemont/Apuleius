"promise me something," i say.  "if i can," he answers.  "when and if we ever have kids, let's promise right now that we'll never let them write all over our caravan--"  "our station wagon."  "what?"  "i'd rather have a station wagon."  "ok...yeah. maybe a passat wagon."  "no, a jetta wagon."  "ok, a jetta wagon. so, if we ever have kids,  promise me  we will never let them write all over our jetta wagon with that colorful soapy stuff, like 'go chargers!' or 'go storm!' or 'go sara #17' because that is quite possibly the most obnoxious thing i've seen on the road lately."  he pauses.
