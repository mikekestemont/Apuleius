    AllHipHop.com: Yeah I heard it.    Shyne: So, he was apologizing after he did the thing on the radio. That call came after, he was like, “I’m sorry, my bad.” He even asked me about [signing to G-Unit] so I let it ride. It wasn’t nothing I had to address, but cause he didn’t keep going on with it. I wasn’t talking at the time, I had the VIBE s**t set up, I had a lot of sh**t set up. I’m a business man. When it came time for me to talk, I had to set that straight. You don’t talk about OG’s like that. You don’t talk about dudes that’s buried alive, fighting for their freedom and its just going to go like that. That’s why [my diss record] is called “for the record.” It’s nothing that deep. You had your time to speak, I held it and now its my time.    AllHipHop.com: Will you continue against 50 Cent when you get out?   Shyne: Anything further than this, I’ll speak to him personally. He can respond, but after this, I’m not rapping about it. I’ll talk to him personally.     AllHipHop.com: Most times, 50 would have fired back something, but they did want you on G-Unit, correct?

Shyne: You have to understand that labels have been getting at me since ’01 and I decided not to take anything, because I wanted to get my appeal shit together and make sure I was right. I wasn’t trying to get slutted out. I heard the Pac stories and just wasn’t trying to get slutted out. I just got done being slutted out and I’m doing 10 years for being somebody’s prostitute. Its like, f**k that. Never again. It came time to live it. I remember when Murder inc came to see me and they were the No. 1 set, on the way to the MTV Awards. Ashanti was on fire. Rule was killin’ em. I was honored that they wanted to f**k with me. But I understood the same way that they had their time, the same way it was Cam the year before, if I stick it, I might get my turn. I might not, but I might so let me wait. So that’s what that was, I could pick and choose. I could be a soldier all over again or I could take what I learned from one of the bosses [P.Diddy]. Despite what I feel about my co-defendant, he was a boss, he was a pioneer on this Hip-Hop entrepreneur s**t. I was there soaking it all up. I said to myself, “Its time to apply what I learned under his watch” and wait. I waited and I got my shot.     Part 2 of this interview is f
