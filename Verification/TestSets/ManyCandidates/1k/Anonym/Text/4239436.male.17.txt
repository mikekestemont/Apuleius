  The Good & The Bad Ones  The other day I saw a site made with 100% flash and it was very hard to get around, because the designer didn't make his site user-friendly, thus I did not know what to do. He didn't have a "Home" button and it was just horrible. On another note, I have seen amazing Flash sites and have been caught in awe and amazement of what you can do with Flash and web animation interactivity. It had buttons, polls, interfaces, downloads, and everything preloaded making it very slick, fast, and flawless.   Too Much?   Flash really is a great program and a huge revolution in the web design industry, but like with anything else; it can be overused. I'm not saying that after about a million sites we should stop using Flash. What I am trying to get across is that 100% complete Flash sites can be very, very bad. Not all web browsers support Flash, and, as with any other program can malfunction at anytime leaving the user feel unwanted or disgusted with your site. Too much Flash can also be upsetting in the fact that not a lot of people are used to it and don't know exactly how to take it. As stated above, to make a Flash site better, add some help documentation in HTML format to keep the user in control not the program.   Alternatives   There are many alternatives to Flash and actually alternatives to help using Flash and HTML together. One of the best things on a Flash site I have seen is a home page splash option. What this does is it allows a person viewing the home page of a website to choose between a "Flash" version of the site or the "HTML" (HTML & CSS) version of the website. The helps the older browser and the ignorant/new people in the computer age. Another way to get away from flash is to try other web languages such as C#, Visual Basic, ASP, and my favorite, PHP/MySQL.   Conclusion   As Flash may spark your interest, you should know the good and the bad of everything. Flash is good in some aspect, but don't overuse it. If it is overused people will get tired and there can be extreme consequences. Have fun with your website and happy coding!  urlLink continued story...
Here we are...now before you "continue", just know that I put much effort into this and imagination. As I have started graphic design, I have realized that you must have a sense of imagination. While thinking of a beautiful spot in the world; with the sun shining just off to the northwest and a canyon to your left. Bliss...total bliss...
