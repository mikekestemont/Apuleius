           And a side note to this.. Movies and TV are DIFFERENT… Movies are artistic mediums that must have ENTERTAINMENT value to survive. TV is produced wholly by TV executives bent on keeping you around for commercials.. Now I know you are saying but "Sean isn't watching a movie and tv the same?".. No they are not the same.. Movies are short (like 1.5 - 3 hours long) and better movies are usually brainchild's of the directors.. (I personally think it is ok to watch 3-4 movies a week) Good directors will not allow their producers to interfere with their visions. Most tv programs (there are exceptions to this rule) are run by literally ten - twenty people, all with different ideas in mind. They are long (some series run 30+ episodes per year), boring, not funny and often overdramatic for no reason. That is all, I am done ranting. Please email me and I will be happy to discuss this with you… NOW ON TO THE FEATURES………
