cigarette butts, half smoked roaches all over the kitchen counter, I counted 3 pipes and a half bag of weed on the coffee table.  I wanted to get IN and OUT of that joint asap.  My husband on the other hand, wanted to linger and snoop. FOR WHAT?! Ugh. Men. There was no one in the apartment when we arrived.  By time I was writing the note that said: Hunt: I took the Xbox & TV b/c it wasn't yours.  If you have any beef with that call my damn father. Later, Trix. About that time I hear "What the F&$&amp;@!!" I turn around and see some cute little ghetto thug white boy, his very white trash girlfriend and their entourage.   I explain the situation and the kid actually asked me to leave the TV.  Eh, No.  Sorry bitch.  It's not yours.  By time my husband and I got home Saturday night around 8pm we were exhausted.  We were looking forward to a nice, cool relaxing time vegging in front of the TV. What's this? It's 89 degrees in my house?  Lovely! Our air conditioner went out.  Of all the weeks, days or times, it had to be Saturday. Luckily my husband called Opie One Kanobe (ha!) to come fix our air.  When Opie arrived,  I noticed that this 60 year old man looked familiar. AH HA! It was Mr. Opie! From the corner store! :) He fixed our unit (a blown fuse somehow) and, due to the fact that he knew me, charged us a very, extremely tee tiny fee (compared to the disasterous amount it shoud have been.) My husband was in disbelief.  And planted a big ole kiss on me for knowing everyone in town!  Sunday... that's today. It's not going so well.  RD went and bought a suit for his Granny's funeral.  Who, by the way is still not passed on.  They say it will be tonight, or in the morning, or next week maybe.  Whichever the case, I know I'm headed to Atlanta for a few days.  Everyone is making a big friggin' deal out of what we're "suppose" to wear.  I've never dealt with this kind of obsurdity before.  Who gives a crap what your'e wearing! You're there to mourn the dead not to model the newest Steve Madden shoes! Oy Vey! Also, RD & I have made the desicion to NOT take our son.  He's only met his great granny a handful of times in his life.  Not that I'm being disrespectful, but my son is not yet 4.  I don't think he's ready for this expierence.  My sister in laws kids will not be in attendence either, so I feel ok. RD tried on his suit for me too.  I almost passed out! The only time I've ever seen my husband look so dashing was when he had to wear his Johnny Cash uniform in the service.  And I told him so.  And there you have it folks.  A quick , paraphrased recap of a quick, exhausting three days.  Until next time A
