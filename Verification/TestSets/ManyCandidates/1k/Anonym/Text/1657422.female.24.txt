accumulate things that we don't necessarily need, or buy new things that make the old obselete. Somewhere along the way, some brilliant (and maybe a little greedy) person, realizing that one man's trash is another man's treasure, invented the yard sale.   So I've accumulated as much unneeded junk as the next guy... OK, possibly more than the next guy, which is why I decided it was high time for a yard sale. I pulled together a nice pile of junk, tagged everything with prices, made signs, and waited for the customers to come. Justin's friend Brian and his fiancee Jennifer came over and brought some of their stuff too to add to the appeal.   We didn't have to wait long before the customers came trickling in. Our road is fairly busy, so it was a good spot for pulling potentional customers in off the street. We haggled, we talked, we sunburned... and in the end, we made almost $150 all together! Who knew junk could be so valuable?! And I've got plenty more where that came from...
So Justin and I were looking into getting a new monitor for my computer. After looking into it, we figured we might as well just buy a whole new computer since it's not that much more expensive. But then we started thinking that if we were gonna get a new computer, we might as well go all out and get a nice one. So here I am looking at the monstrous 20" screen of our new iMac. I've always wanted to give an Apple a try but was a little scared of jumping into unknown territory, being that I'm so used to PCs. But man, this thing is niiiice! It's great for doing stuff with photos and there's a neat program where you can write songs with all sorts of different instruments. I can't wait to play with it all a little more. Justin's even more excited about it than I am, so I have a feeling we'll be fighting over it most evenings. Guess we'll have to start learning how to share...
The country that gave millions of drunk people the opportunity to prove in front of a crowd that they can't carry a tune now has given video-game-junkie white males a chance to redeem their reputation for having two left feet... Yep, move over Karaoke, Dance Dance Revolution is here! In case you're not up on this fad that hit arcades several years ago and is now sweeping video game players' homes, here's how it works: Instead of a hand-held controller, players use a large pad on the floor like this:      The screen gives you a series of arrows to step on at specific times to the beat of the music, with dozens of songs of varying speed and difficulty. This addictive game is the latest addition to our "game room"--though it's as much a workout as it is a game. A word of warning to those who haven't tried it before: as corny as you think it is beforehand, you will get a
