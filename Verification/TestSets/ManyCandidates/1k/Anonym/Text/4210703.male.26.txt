bad. A huge civil rights movement was just a flash in the pan. And now what? I'll have to endure ignorant assholes on the radio, in the news or in the elevator talking about how a wrong has been made right. I swear, for the next few days, when I hear people discuss gay marriage, I'll feel like I'm eating nothing but pate for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  And then the govenor of New Jersey resigned today because he had an extramarital affair with a man. I wonder if it occurred to the majority of people that maybe he wouldn't have been married to a woman in the first place if people were more accepting of homosexuality. What a mess bigotry creates.  Anyway, I'm done with my ranting for the day. Time for a nap before the tranny rock show tonight.
I should be getting to bed, but each time I stare back at my big empty thing, I keep thinking that there is so much I haven't done in the day, and that there is so much yet to do. And so if I were limited to one metaphor for my life, it would be an empty bed at night- a bed that should have my body's indentations, but doesn't. It doesn't even call for me. It sits there, like me- flat and demanding, but without specifically asking for attention, almost denying that it's asking for attention when it's really begging for it.  It sounds so dreary, the way I put things, but that's just how I am. I figure that if I live my pain loudly enough, one day it will do something. Maybe I'll reach someone who can make it stop. Maybe prettier words will come together and become something useful, like a story or book. To some extent I've put those thoughts behind me. But as I get older, and as I make decisions that lead me further away from my creative ambitions, I feel some need to reconnect with language and put these words online. It's like there's the spirit of a writer inside me who's slowly dying, and these are his last words- sort of like Ted Hughes' ode to Sylvia Plath. Hence the blog.  As I write, I feel disappointed with what's coming out. I wanted something cooler, more moving, more beautifully said, like what comes out during the rare moments I sit down at my computer or at a notepad and try to tell a story. The shocking thing about getting older for me is how useless the struggle for perfection really is. It's a losing battle I wish I never took up in the first place. But then I find myself joining in the fight at the most inopportune times no matter how much I try to let go of attaining perfection. Point is: I'll say lots of things on this here thingy. They can't all be epiphanies, tragedies, comedies, enlightening political insights, etc. It'll just be my life- my highly imperfect, flawed life that I don't enjoy as often as I s
