Graduation went quite well.  All dolled up with make-up and NOT jeans and t-shirt, many of Amanda's friend's didn't even recognize her.  The dance was a lot of fun for her too... It was her first dance so I am thrilled she enjoyed it.  There was a bit of teenage drama as two of her friends had a falling out based on some rumors ("sombody said that someone thought they saw..." ) .  I told her that she shouldn't take sides because what someone thinks they saw, or what someone thought someone said, may not be what ACTUALLY happened.  Not that they are lying, but that it could be a simple misunderstanding.   I also told her that it's ok to be understanding and sympathetic of what others are going through, but if there is nothing that she can do to help, she shouldn't let it ruin her fun because on top of feeling bad about the situation, her friend would feel guilty about ruining her fun.  She said that made a lot of sense.  Not only does my daughter think I'm cool, she thinks I'm smart too!
We found a nice outfit for Amanda yesterday.  And it didn't cost nearly as much as I thought it would, including shoes and jewelry.... Thank you Fashion Bug!  Brian got home from Chicago and made a killing at the Transformer Convention.  He was able to repay the money I loaned him from last year and this year.  Very nice.   Of course he missed me terribly, and even though it was nice I invited him to sleep with me... not much sleeping, and a couple of new and enjoyable experiences.  Very worth the while.
Went to the Rice Street Festival yesterday.  Amanda was in the talent show and was disappointed that she didn't win, but it was a nice day to be outside.  Today was fun too.  We picked up Rae and Kelli and went to see "The Village".  That was one very freaky movie.  It will definately become a cult classic very quickly.  We then went to OCB and as usual when it's the four of us we became the entertainment when I went "knock on wood" while rapping on my head and caused Amanda to shoot milk out her nose... AGAIN!    I don't know what happens when the four of us are together, but it's really crazy.  We went to a number of stores to find a dress for Amanda's graduation.  Nothing really was what she wanted, but did settle on a skirt and top that is nice.  We'll keep looking though... we have to find shoes anyway.  Sunday evening is a bad time to  be shopping since everything closes.  Tomorrow is the last shot, so I'll keep my fingers crossed.  I don't want her to just "settle"... e
