coffee and discussed pur feelings about it for a couple of hours.  Now, for those of you who know Zack, you know him as a very quiet, borderline shy person who only speaks when something is truly important is to be said.  Well, he has started speaking and nodoby is going to be able to stop him now.  Zack works in a place where everyone around him owns at least a gun, very conservative, Bush supporter, Christians.  He is a sort of odd-duck but has always been treated with lots of respect and his views have always been inf anything, tolerated.  On Sunday, he brought up the fact that he really wanted to put up money for people where he works to pay for the ticket to go see the film.

There are numerous honest, real, uncut interviews and sections of press footage that simply cannot be ignored.    Please see this film in the theaters.  Don't wait until it comes to home video.
