 Or, perhaps, make somebody  like  me for a change.  I mean, theres Paul, but he is always talking about 'world domination' schemes that never get off the ground. He thinks like a buisinessman, but this isnt neccessarily a good thing when trying to have a casual conversation :-D(joke, paul if you read this dont take it the wrong way):-D. Then theres Ben and Adam. Okay, but very very very annoying. Dominic and Jhonny really secerately hate me, they just pretend to like me because paul likes me and they want paul to like them and...you can guess the rest.  On a different subject, I got really close to having my first real girlfriend. Not a prank, a joke or a ten-second stitch-up as I have had in the past, but a real girlfriend. Well, that went down the plughole like most other things in my life which is, in the words of CM Burns (off the Simpsons) "Doing that thing again". She was acting wierd for a while...and so was I for that matter. I knew that Chalkstone was going to tell her I fancied her (just for the record, I DO but I like to keep it a secret because I am absolutely terrified of peoples reaction) so I told Paul I 'had to do domething' and just went all break and lunch...wandering...like a lost soul...thinking...getting shouted at and things thrown at me...  (apologies if I am making anybody feel depressed, but it is your life, your responsibility, no body forced you to read this and so its all your fault. Sorry, but it is.  and dont come crying to me, okay buster?)  So, thats how the day went. In summary: -one millimeter away from my first kiss -one millimeter away from my first (i think) suicidal death -one millimeter away from getting a detention -one millimeter away from my first girlfriend Its actually been quite a millimeter sorta day. 5 millimeters away from...what? a totally different day? a totally different life? a totally different death? Who knows.   I hate days like theese. 0.5 cm away from...................what? (isnt it wierd that thursdays are the ONE days in my timetable where I dont get a maths lesson and I think about millimeters more today (a thursday) then than any other day?  I wonder if I were to drop dead now, would people remembver me? If yes, what as? an idiot? a wierdo? a sadass? a pessimist?   Well, until next time,  bye...   P.S. If you think that is depressing, you should see  urlLink THIS POST !  PPS: Change of plan: I am no longer comitting suicide.
Animal rights campaignes have it all wrong. First off, if one of their relatives gets cancer or something, they will change their their tune. Next, they fail to realise that animal testing is highly regulated and the government will stop any abusers. Lastly, just think. Only 86% of animals actually die. And, just think how many animals are saved by theese medicnes after they are releaced to the hospitals and vets. Common sense, if you ask m
