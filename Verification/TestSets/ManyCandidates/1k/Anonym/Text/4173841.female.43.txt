Gito was shot everyone is crying and making soup people come from everywhere they are phoning and we are trying to find them in the dream your legs can’t move when it’s your time Erika wants to think about justice but I lost my confidence I will drive up and down President Street Jerusalem late at night looking for my promised land, eating my manna, breaking my commandments but I can’t also be expected to speak crevices in my character where terror creeps in to stop my tongue from turning we can’t hold our faces straight Before Gito died it felt like everything was ok because we weren’t lying in the street shot in the neck dead and waiting for someone’s mother to come but she was not at home  AND WHERE IS THEIR DAD?
