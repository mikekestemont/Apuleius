many many of the creatures you see around you are also something else, in another world. Here, they are creatures of earth so you can understand them, because you would not understand them in the forms that they really take. They are also appearing as earth creatures so that they can live here not noticed too much by humans, so that they can do the work for humans that they have to do. We are creatures from a world of creatures who help humans. When we reach especially a certain maturity, we are given a job to do in the world of earth which is to follow a certain human and do two things for them: first, we report on the status of the human, which would be to say if the human is okay or not okay, and second we document what the human is doing. This is very very important to do, because humans so often do not document themselves. It is also a problem that those who do document themselves do not any longer have the time to do the things that they must be doing in their world. So our job is to help them do what they need to be doing but also to record what they do. Every human does things that should be recorded - this is what was decided and so our world was given the order that what our job is to do is to make sure that human lives be written down so that they can be remembered in this way. I do not always know why this is so important and who will read these stories but I do as I am told and trust that this is important for us to do for humans. This is what we do. Not every human has a documenter, but almost all of them do. We documenters look like different earth creatures when we are on earth. I should also say to you that we can also be invisible. Lizards can not realistically go everywhere without being regarded suspiciously!  This is my first assigment to a human - I have only just reached the required maturity. There is one thing that I do not understand though, and hope to have told to me before long - I have a third task, which is to write my record of Alex's story here in electric format, for other humans to read. This means that I am blowing our cover! - humans never, I think, knew about us documenting them. That I have been given this order to write here for humans to see means that this is on purpose, it is decided that humans SHOULD know that they are being documented in this way. I do not know why. This is strange. But there must be a good reason, even if I am never to be told it.  I am tired and have only just arrived in Edmonton with Alex, and I will tell you about our journey soon. I wish you a good n
