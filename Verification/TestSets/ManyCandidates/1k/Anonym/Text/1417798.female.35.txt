a different spelling)--->BUSY. HOpe everyone is doing great!  C'mon all you missing LevenGals- POST!!
Hi Ellen! This site is too quiet! :-( Just got done watching 3 mini video's on Fox news.com. I like "Talking points" and "common sence", also watched the short news update. I hope everyone has a great 4th! We plan to stay put. Beannachd agus slainte!(blessings and health) Teri
hi levengals, i just finished reading 'The Da Vinci Code'... a great read, i couldn't put it down. it's fiction but it makes you think... but putting the religion issues aside this author, dan brown, is a great storyteller, imo. shep is off this week but i noticed last week that his hair seemed to have gotten darker... or is it just my tv? nat - rick hosting weekend live last week? and i missed it? BIG TIME SAD FACE. thanks for sharing todd... i, too, can't decide which i favor more. with all that's been happening in iraq this past week, for the first time since this war started i feel more positive about the outcome. seeing saddam in front of that judge was interesting. want to say more but gotta go...  4 more days b4 big brother 5 and the amazing race starts. :)    happy 4th of july
Heya girlies!!  Sorry for my absence yet again. I SERIOUSLY have got to stop not posting here.... but I don't hardly even post on my own blog, so I don't log into blogger too often, therefore I forget to post here. Urgh... sorry... you didn't need to know all that LOL.  Well not much is new. I'm going to Ozzfest on Tuesday. And classes start August 16th. Other than that I've just been keeping  busy with work. And my new obsession which is making fan music videos and fanart/wallpapers. I'm opening a new site soon ( urlLink euphonies.com ) for all that crap I've been working on. Still doing photography too, but I'm way too lazy to organize a photography site. ONE of these days I'll get around to it. heh heh  LOL Nat! You *finally* changed your name.  I went to NYC a couple weeks ago. I didn't see Rick *frown* AND I fell off a horse in Brooklyn and hurt my back. *ouch* I was in some serious pain for about a week. Thank GOD this weekend it has lessened considerably. I don't even notice it anymore unless I make a sudden movement or something, so at least it's healing. I was upset for a couple days because I couldn't even put on my own freakin socks... and it's seriously depressing to feel helpless.  Anyway, I'm rambling. But I'm going to make it a goal to try and come in here more often.... like once a week or so. :) I haven't really had much of a chance to catch Fox News lately (except for the occational H&C) but I'm hoping with things calming down at work and classes starting that I'll have more time to veg in front of the TV.  Talk to you gals later!!! MISS Y
