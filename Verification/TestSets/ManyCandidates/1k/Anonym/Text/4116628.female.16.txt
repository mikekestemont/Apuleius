someone about it.  It bothers me when I hear people talk about how much they hate their parents because they won’t give them money for the movies or things like that. These are people who have stability in their family and home they don’t appreciate any of it. In my whole life, (and I’m 16 turning 17 in October) I have attended 12 different schools. This year I am going to be in 11th grade (Junior year) …and it’s going to be the 13th school I’ve attended. Are you asking why? If so, it’s NOT because my family is in the military or… in any job that requires a lot of relocating. After all the moving and changing schools and all that, you’d think I’d be used to it by now. But I’m not. *sighs* but that’s life for me. …and there’s nothing I can do but live it. 11:20 AM August 05 2004 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Anyway... what happened today?  At the moment I am watching "Most Identical Twin Test" on Discovery Health. I have ALWAYS wanted to have a twin. So... yeah, I'm finding this quite interesting. I just came back from the gym. I did 1.54miles on the eliptical machine in 18 minutes. My legs are killing. I have to take a shower soon. AHH!! I think my brother just chopped some MAJOR onions because I can feel it in my eyes. Anyway.. I'm off to go take that shower. Till next time! =)
Listening to: The rain drops dripping out side my window. Climate: humid, eck. Feeling: Content, slightly pressured.   Entry number 2! Yay! Yeah... it's raining over here. It's not bad but the roads are wet enough. I don't have to even look for I can hear when the cars pass by. I went to the gym today. I did 1.55 miles in 20 minutes on the treadmill! Yeah... I could do better I know. I'm in such a bad shape... I am short at 4'11" 115 lbs and with a poor lungs... *sighs* but I'm working on it! :) I may not get any taller but I think I can improve my endurance. Feeling slightly pressure I am. I have to find a job, soon! Before the school year even starts I have to find one. I HAVE to find one. My very survival depends on it. I have to buy my own stuff this year because money is really tight. So... tomorrow I'm planning on going on a job hunt. Well.. I think that's it for today entry.
Listening to: "He Don't Love You Like I Love You" Climate: hot. Feeling: Content.  I don't really know why I've signed up for this. I mean, I already keep a diary... oh well... I guess I'm online most of the time any way. *shrugs*  Let's see what happened today... I woke up... got dressed... oh I cleaned the kitchen a bit. Fun fun! not really... but eh someone's gotta do it.  I honestly don't have a lot to say so... I'm gonna end this here. Maybe something will happen l
