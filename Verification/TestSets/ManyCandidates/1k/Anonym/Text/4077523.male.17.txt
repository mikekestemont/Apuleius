question it probably isn't the person. Well anyway if anyone finds anything wrong with this post let me know, but I just felt the Holy Spirit leading me to say it. Well C-ya. -Fly With Christ
Hey, I just got back from evening service at Church. We had this guy named Luke giving a concert there and it was fun. I am really tired. I am glad that I can finally sleep in tomorrow if I can avoid being woke up by someone in my family, it was because of them I didn't get to sleep in Saturday.        Anywho, school starts back on the 10th for me and I really don't want it to. Another thing is I refuse to buy a senior jersey because I am not about to pay 50 dollars for something I will only wear once. They are grey baseball jerseys instead of the traditional football jerseys, normally I would be o.k. with a baseball jersey but these things are UGLY! And I will not buy one from them.        I am hoping to get a digital camera before football season and create a blog with maybe a few others and have it be about the life of a band geek, haha.        Anyway, I g2g, Peace!
Hey! How's it goin? I just got back from Church today, it was a pretty good sermon. I got to see everyone that finally got back from Beach Blast. At first I really didn't want to go, simply because, I knew what I missed out on and that made me a bit sad. But then I started thinking, it doesn't matter if I went or not, I mean I know I missed out on some fun stuff but, it's not about what I want, it is about what God wants for me. I hope that makes sense and if it doesn't let me know and I will try to rephrase it.      I just wanted to take time to say thanks for the prayers whoever has seen this and prayed for me. They are really helping. Whitney and Dawn, if one or both of you ever stumble across this blog thank you for the prayers also. Chelsey, thanks for being there for me in the past, and being someone I could talk to. Thanks Davis, you tha man!, you have been someone else I could talk to, oh yeah and if you see this Davis, tell Caroline I said Hey!, haha. And thanks Tiffany J. for being a good friend to me.      Oh, and Jay Rod! I know you have moved to Florida, and I am sorry that I didn't have a chance to say bye and I thought you were leaving later. But you have been a great friend and I am glad I know you. I will miss ya! Let me know how things are going.      Well that is all for now, and thanks to anyone I have forgot to mention, I probably forgot a few since I am being rushed. Anywho, please keep praying and I will post later. -Fly With C
