a trust that "Together with the British-based Wellcome Trust, which holds assets worth around £9bn, the foundation leads the world in charitable giving."  It's mad really.  Anyway, I promise a rant sometime soon.

I'm tired.. Really really tired.  Years ago I had a huge issue with "friendships" where people I considered friends suddenly turned out to be anything but.. I then went out of my way to not take friendships at face value and to make sure I only ever make real connections with someone I think is worth it.   Taken from Dictionary.com: friendship \Friend"ship\, n. [AS. fre['o]ndscipe. See  Friend , and  -ship .] 1. The state of being friends; friendly relation, or attachment, to a person, or between persons; affection arising from mutual esteem and good will; friendliness; amity; good will. There is little friendship in the world. --Bacon. There can be no friendship without confidence, and no confidence without integrity. --Rambler. Preferred by friendship, and not chosen by sufficiency. --Spenser.  2. Kindly aid; help; assistance, [Obs.] Some friendship will it [a hovel] lend you gainst the tempest. --Shak.  3. Aptness to unite; conformity; affinity; harmony; correspondence. [Obs.] Those colors . . . have a friendship with each other. --Dryden.   The most apt part of that for me is "There can be no friendship without confidence, and no confidence without integrity."  In every relationship I have be it friendship or more I am demanding when it comes to the integrity of trust with the people I make a connection with. I have no problem with the occasional mistake, but intentional deception is too much  for me. Add to that then going on to tell someone something about me that you have no proof of and if you think about it you must realise is a lie?!  I just about give up. I have a friend, a true friend. We have our ups and downs, we go through phases where we don't see each other and when we do we are a bit distant.. We are in different places and stuff, but the thing is we always know that we are friends and that will always come first. No matter what happens that person has always been there for me and has always treated me with nothing but respect. Other friends seem to just spring from no-where and I find out this whole side that I never knew was there. Then I try to clear the air and talk to them about things and they lie to my face.  "Everything is fine, no big deal, there's no problem, really..."  If that is the case then why is it that when you talk about me behind my back you have nothing but bad things to say..  To be fair this is only really happening with two people but it is two people that I thought more of and I just can't get it.
