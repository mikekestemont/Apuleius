and it may have to be in august, because I have a birthday party to go to the 17th, and I'm gone the 24th-31st on a serve project in Woodstock, Ontario... so... T-T  I ish so sorry!   **  Added note:  Bring me REAL candy!  X3  **  **added note to added note:  I mean like smarties and aeros**
Today I woke up early to go river tubing with my best friend, Hannah.  Yay!  :D    But she called to say that it was gunna rain, so we wouldn't go.  Boo.   But she did say that if I wanted to, I could come over!   So I went to her house.  We were watching me fail horribly at trying to use the PS1 controllers, when all of a sudden... BAM!  Clear skies!  So hannah went to change into her swimsuit, and they took me home, and I raced into my swimsuit, grabbed my stuff and stole my brother's sandals.  XD     So we go to the store for snacks and drinks along the way, then we stop at the bank, and we ended up accidently stealing the container, so we had to go back... o_O;;   There were so many delays.  Then, our big one.  We didn't know if we were lost or not, so Hannah's mom looks at the streetsign name for about two seconds, because we saw a sign that looked familiar and a river, but then when she turns her attention to the road, all the cars ahead had stopped, so she screeched the break and swirved right, and we ended up in the ditch.    Hannah and I were out of it, because we had no clue what was going on.  We didn't hear the screeching tires or feel us swirved.  I only realized we were going into the ditch when the high-way sign was right infront of us and being pushed down.  Then everthing was leaning towards me.  o_O;;  A little farther to the right, and we would have been rolling... you know, car flipping on its side over and over again?  And that would have been baaaad... because I would be veddy injured.  But we're all okay, and suprisingly enough, Hannah and I wern't even shaken by it.  My shoulder aches, but thats because I slept on it wrong last night.  O_O;;   The mega question Hannah and I wanted to know was "Can we keep the sign?"  It was all bent and weird, but we were smart, and we asked the police woman:  "What do you do to broken highway signs?"  she replied by saying "We melt them down and make them into new ones" ... oh.  Phoey.  Oh well.  : D   So I'm in a police record, because I was in the car, but the rubber thing to protect from mud is ripped, and a few scratches on the car, but otherwise, the whole 'adventure' WAS SO FUN!  XD   :3  We wondered if the car was damaged if we would ride in the back of the police car, because we overheard the policepeople talking about "putting them in the police car".  X
