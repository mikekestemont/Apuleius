in March, I was also in the running for an associate editor position at John Leguizamo's magazine, 'iCaramba.' iCaramba was a start-up magazine for Latino college students and they really liked my resume, my knowledge of Latin culture and my background. But I panicked because iCaramba was a start-up magazine....so I took the mb job instead--and they promised me benefits and fulltime status. And that never happened. And guess what...iCaramba is selling really well in Latin America and I got royally f*cked at my job!!!!! I could kick myself for not taking the iCaramba job back in March.  Thank god I freelance and can make a little extra money doing that. But--hiiiiiiiiiii, I need a job now. This is not good. I have rent to pay!!  I have never been fired from a job. Even in high school and college, I would leave a job because I had to A) Go back to school or B) Because I was moving. I always waited until I reached my boiling point, and then quit. I hate doing that. But I can't take a job that's 'sketchy' or detrimental to my self-esteem.  I emailed iCaramba and asked if they still had my resume, and they said, yes, they totally remember me and will let me know if anything opens up...but still...my gut told me in March to TAKE that iCaramba job, but instead my nervous system took over and I took the dot.com gig instead.  I just never learn. Now I'm back on the job hunt and I'm flipping out because my lease is up in four weeks. Four weeks?! What am I going to do?! Help!
It poured this entire weekend because of Florida's Hurricane Charley. This has been the wettest, most depressing, most lame-ass summer. I hardly got any swimming in. I didn't go to Amagansett or Boston. And it's been so humid, I feel like my makeup is melting into my pores. *sigh* And the summer Olympics are so boring they are NOT making up for my summer.  Anyway....I am so glad I only have three days left of work. But not glad that I have no idea what I am doing with my life; at all.  I am so pre-menstral today I have been eating everything in sight. I hate PMS.  Since only--what, two people?--are reading my blog, I can 'fess up that I have a tiny crush on this guy at my old job...the job I USED to have, and now only work at a few hours a month to make quick extra money. It's more of a 'work-crush' situation. In my sick, twisted little head, if we ever get together, I'll delete this post, heh...but in the interim, I'll let myself have a crush. I deserve one. I can't tell what he thinks of me, but we make eye contact a lot, and I think that's important. But who knows?  Anyway; I am so exhausted. This non-stop rain can make anyone so moody and tired. I'll post more again soon. I didn't get any freelancing done this weekend, B
