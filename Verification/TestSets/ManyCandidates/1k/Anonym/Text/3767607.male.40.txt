content results in the ability to quickly find images and data, which systemizes workflow, saving time and money (Brown).   In the computer world . . . there are systems that will pick up after us and remember where we put things. These systems will retrieve items, let us pass them around, and then clean the place up when we're through. I refer, of course, to the software and hardware systems that are called, variously, digital media management, media asset management or digital asset management (DAM) (Smith).  Digital asset management is the software and hardware needed for content management.  The location in which content is stored is the asset repository.   Asset (or Content) Repository  Actual “asset repositories” are generally found in large, high-end asset management systems ($100,000 and up).  Asset repositories are a “secure collection of the source files themselves”.  The image at the webpage below shows the asset repository as a sort of holding tank for content.   urlLink http://www.assetnow.com/index.cfm/4,437,html   A large asset repository performs like a database.  It contains: security, replication, backup safeguards, disaster recovery, referential integrity, centralized data management and a hierarchical storage structure. “Such a system lends itself to workflows that require access security, including management of rights or permissions and access for suppliers or customers. These systems require a high-performance server, a fast network and significant online storage capacity” (Brown).  Asset repositories are sophisticated and expensive systems that contain the actual content within a secure database.  This usually means higher performance software like , “high-end UNIX servers, formidable online storage, and very high-speed networks”.  This allows for “security levels, replication, referential integrity, and centralized data management. Also included is the comfort of full hierarchical storage management and disaster recovery” (Ross).     Solutions based on the asset repository model are ideal when systematizing studios with industrial workflow, managing rights and permissions (such as the intellectual property of either your company or a third party), and structuring global access by employees, contractors, suppliers, partners, and customers (Smith).   Media Catalog vs. Asset Repository  Instead of an asset repository, smaller companies often use media catalogs “that store proxies alone, indexed to the source files" (Brown).  Media catalogs have proxies (like thumbnails) which are stored in a database indexed by keywords.  The actual source files are under the control of the operating system and are not touched.  Media catalogs are low cost, easy to install and administer and have “scalability across multiple divisions of an enterprise” (Ross).  Media catalogs don’t manage the actual content, so anyone with system access to view, change, move or delete content elements (Ross).
