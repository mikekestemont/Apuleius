the things going on in my head... in my home... And who said blondes couldn't be deep. I really don't know what to do. I feel almost guilty for wanting to try to start my life.  Thanks for reading, It helped just to get it down...
I am so tired, and on the way to bed, I will post tomorrow, but I wanted to let yall know my good news. I just made moderator on Poetry Array... Which may not seem like a big deal, but I am completely new to the online community thing, and I really love it. I spend all of my free time there! I love to write, obviously, and PA helped to bring that back into my life.     The teacher still doesn't have our papers graded, nor our tests, so I am still biting my nails on this!!!!  I will hopefully know something on Monday.  I hate being up in the air.   I am going to bed now, more tomorrow... ;)   Good night all!

*Bites nails* I have a test tonight... Studied some, okay for those of you who know me, I studied some, for those of you who don't some may be considered a lot... But I don't have that positive feeling I usually have before a test... Then I have my Final on the 11th.... That means I have two more classes to go over the rest of the material... I hate summer classes. Don't get me wrong, American history is not a bad subject... But we are going over a ton of material in a short time, less than 6 weeks. OUCH! *no nails left to bite, switches to lip*  I hope I get my paper back, I would feel better if I knew I had a good grade on it... (good by my standards means 90 and up) My stomach is doing it's flip flop thing as it always does when I get stressed... Having a nervous stomach is no fun...  I am going for now, I may or may not try to post more later, it depends on how upset I feel after my test... Keep your fingers crossed (while not typing, typing with crossed fingers is pretty difficult...)
Darkness falls and swallows me no light that I can see  An endless cold resides within more bitter than an arctic wind  Empty sails on a windless sea no hope of ever sailing free  Imagined chains bind me here yet its not the end I fear  Happiness taunts my memory with pleasant thoughts I almost see  A moth's embrace is just like me drawn to false light illusions that I see  Fluttered wings leave dusty marks kisses on my soul naked I am stark  A deserts stretch my nubile pain dry and endless a vital drain  A lonely creature pull it in no one to share the gravest of all s
