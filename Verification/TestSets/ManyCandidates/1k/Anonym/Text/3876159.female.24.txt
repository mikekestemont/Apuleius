That is just great. I study...my nose runs. I move around and try to pack stuff...my nose runs. I sit at the computer typing on my blog...my nose runs. IT NEVER STOPS. Where is it all coming from? Grossed out?  Reminder!!!: Gotta get a special birthday present before Sunday! Happy Birthday in advance if you read this!!!!!
The Last Supper ....   the painting   ...is located in Milan....just so there is no confusion.
In all this hassle and bussle, I can't help but step by and take a second look at this whole thing. I just can't help but wonder...is it all worth it? I mean, as much money as I am having to borrow and as many people as I am putting out to help me in one way or another, I am not truly convinced at this was the best decision.  I mean, at the time I was completely convinced that this was the direction I was suppose to take my life and I said that once I commit to the decision, I must stick with it. But looking back and evaluating my decision, I have to wonder if I didn't want to go so bad that I MADE everything just fall into place...instead of just letting them happen, thus landing me in this very place in my life.  I never thought this would be easy but financially, I feel so ....like this was a mistake. If I pull out now, I will lose so much money and dignity. I really want to go. I think this will be the best thing I will ever do in all my lifetime. But I seriously sugar coated the financial end of the thing. I honestly and humbly believe that at the time the money was all going to work itself out...but it hasn't yet.  I am not totally inclined to throw in the towel just yet, but am having doubts that exceed all my expectations.  If it is meant to be that I go...all will fall into place.
I know that I have written in awhile but I have just not felt up to it.  I have nothing to say that is of interest b/c I will just gripe and gripe. I have too much freakin stuff to do.   But on a side note...Before Sunset was so awesome. I really want to go back and watch Before Sunrise again.  I am so glad this fabulous movie was brought to my attention.   I wish I wasnt' so lazy. I wish I didn't procrastinate so much. My life would be considerable easier if I just did what needed to be done..and if it gets done early. Great. But no! I do my best work when I am stressed out and tired.  Like right now. What am I doing? I am procrastinating doing something at this very minute b/c I would rather ramble on and on about how I procrastinate than actually get up and do something.    I better go.   I promise once I leave this site will be the beez neez!!!! But now...now is not the t
