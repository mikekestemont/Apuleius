how I pray:  "Dear God, thank you for all the blessings. You really love me. Im sorry for acting like a spoiled brat sometimes..ok half the time..promise ill make up for it..in the future. Please guide me, esp with my studies.. take care of my family, my friends, everybody in school and the whole world.. even those who hate me..  And God, please help me in my pursuit to become a size 0 so I can fit in those Roberto Cavalli dresses and Tyler pants (with the air) when I can I finally afford them or have come up with a flat 1 average and bribe my parents with it. Thank you God, i love you."  3. I silently contemplate suicide whenever a person does not know what DKNY stands for or the difference bet suede and velvet.   4. I stay up late just watching Fashion Television. U think women walking up and down the ramp is boring? Well, what do u make out of watching races joined by schumacher..he wins all the time, its no contest! let it go.   lets all watch fashion television and will&grace..we shud be inspired by karen's penchant for designer clothes..so we wudnt look the same all the freaking time.  5. I think Coco Chanel is a hero.  6. The number of fashion magazines (Cosmo, et al) i have can successfully burn our house in a minute when u light them up.   7. The wrong color of socks can make or break a guy's outfit and the wrong shade of stockings can destroy a woman's reputation. I don't need to wear stockings, thankyouverymuch!  8. I get sad when I don't get to buy anything. As in depressed.  9. I enjoy reading Oscar Wilde..and those fashion critic's articles about every fashion show here or otherwise.  10. And lastly.. I keep every paper bag of the diff stores...as remembrance.
A promise or a dare I would jump if I knew you'd catch me Staring over the edge I can't tell if you'll be here for me  I close my eyes and make a wish Turn out the lights and take a breath Pray that when the wick is burned You would say that it's all about love  [Chorus:]  You were there when I needed you You were there when the skies broke wide, wide open You were there when I needed you You were there when the skies broke wide, wide open  You were never here  I remember you said Love was more than your good intentions Empty boxes on the floor Things I never asked you for I pray that when the wick is burned You would say that it's all about love  [Chorus]  I can't see the promise of Excuses you fall upon I pray to God not holding on To things you've left undone  [Chorus x 2]  You were there when I You were there when I You were there when I needed you    this song was playing on my mind while i was taking my exam in literature.         i really hope i passed that t
