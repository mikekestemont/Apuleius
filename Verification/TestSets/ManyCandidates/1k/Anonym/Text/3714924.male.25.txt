Thanks SO MUCH to all of you for your support of this initiative. Many of you have also volunteered your time when you visit Jammu in the coming months and even next year. I will do my best to set up some long term program to continue helping the children in our own small way.  I have had many people volunteer their time to attend the retreat and speak to and spend time with the children. Thanks to my fellow US-based youth Nihar Ganju (FL) and Priya Sultan (NJ) who will be in Jammu at the same time and will help coordinate this event. Thanks also to the many Jammu-based volunteers such as Kailash Mehra Sadhu and Krishen Langoo who will lead the children in singing. We are also finalizing a distinguished list of speakers to speak on various topics.  As for messages of support, I had four poster size cardboards full of messages of support written by some attendees of the July 4 KOA National Camp. I am going to have these framed and they will be hung on the walls of either their school or community hall.  And as for donations, we have raised over $750 thus far, which has been very encouraging. I will be making the necessary purchases once I get to India.    Please do get checks and letters to me soon if you too wish to contribute.   Ideally we still need the following donated: - Burned CDs for them to listen to on their new CD Player (thanks to the Zutshis!) - things such as Hindi filmi songs would be great, as well as things in Kashmiri - Books (please suggest titles) that affected you growing up - Musical Instruments - General Expenses to cover catering for 100 people for 3 days and renting buses and vans for sightseeing  Thanks to the following people for their donations:  Manju Bakaya - Carrom Boards Priyanka Bakaya - Paint and Paintbrushes Gautam Bazaz - General Expenses Neeraj Bhat - Cricket Bats and Balls Deepa & Heena Bhatt - Art Supplies Simi Bhat - Playing Cards Simi Bhat - Comics  Sunil Dhar - Pens & Pencils Vikram & Neiha Dhar - Musical Instruments Amit & Geeta Kaul - Kulfi Moti Kaul - General Expenses Sunil Kaul - Books (Physics, Math) Sunil Kaul - Comics (Archies) Sunil Kaul - Pens, Pencils and Notebooks Tej & Vijay Kaul - General Expenses Sumeer Khosa - General Expenses Vikram Mathu - Science Books Ashish Labroo - Textbooks Karan Raina - Badminton Set(s) Rasika Raina - Comics (Amar Chitra Katha) Rajen Razdan - Chess Boards Vipin Sher - Comics (Amar Chitra Katha) Sugam & Payal Tiku - Tape Recorder Nixy & Aroop Zutshi - CD P
