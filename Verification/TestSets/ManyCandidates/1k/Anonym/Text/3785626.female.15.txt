I bought a shirt on the sales rack for 1.99 ROCKIN!!! Then I bought this blue and baby blue cap. Matches my chuck's. Big Pimpin. Anyways I had lots of fun. We were going to go bowling but her little cousin aggravated the heck out of his momma so we couldn't go. Pooey. Oh well.  >>today tregory came over. woohoo. we played basketball. i won. cause i played by my rules (lots of fouling). hehehe, anyways i've seen the biggest trend this year is Pink and Black. and it doesn't have to be PUNK its on EVERYTHING!!! i swear...some pink and black is okay but i see it everywhere. ugh. and also "vintage" shirts that have stuff on 'em. Like DOTS candy or CHARMS suckers. yameen? they are cute but its such a trend. BLAH...anyways tomorrow is band camp. woohoo lucky me.
i think my insecurities about tregory cheating are stupid. i believe he wouldn't cheat on me but then again my mind continues to think about it. sometimes i wonder...but i have no doubt that i love him. yeee band camp not.
.band camp. yay. i love tregory. wheee. goodbye. love.cherry.
Today was okay. I went to band camp like usual. At break Tregory was at the park so he came over to see me. I told him last night he was scared to come up there, I just wanted him to come and see me since I haven't seen him in 3 days. Heheh, Sneaky. Band was okay, we got alot of stuff accomplished but Mr. Mac got to see our bad side, cause alot of people were talking. Then after band Tregory was still there. Yay. And I went home for lunch. Then Ashley called me and told me we weren't having practice. So yay. After that I went back to the band hall and got my instrument. Then I went to Piggly Wiggly. I'm never going there again. I know I said that before but now I'm for real. I'm buying a cake for my dad so I'm looking at cake mixes. (Did you know they make caramel cake mix?) This dude walks by and says..Dude: Hey How Ya Doing?Me: Um..Okay?Dude: Baking a cake?Me: Uh..Yeah? *Stupid! Why else would I be in the cake mix section.*Dude: Gonna bake me one?Me: Uh..NO!? (I should have said HELL FUCKING NO)Dude: Aw, man.Perverts must crowd around Piggly Wiggly or something. Ugh Anyways I'm so happy I got to see Tregory. Let me tell you my dream.Okay I don't really like this girl Jackie because she's kind of nosy and loud but I'm cool with her. Anyways last night I had a dream I was stabbing her with a fork. Weird huh? Not stabbing her in the heart or nothing just on her hand because she had something of mine. I guess I don't like her because she used to go with Tregory in the 8th grade, even though I wasn't here. Anyways it was kind of cool. Haha. Well thats my day. Today is my dad's birthday. Yay!!Later Love, Cherry I LOVE T
