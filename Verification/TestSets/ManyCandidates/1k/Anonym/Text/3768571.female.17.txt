I don't trust her anymore than I'd trust George Bush to do something intelligent, and I dislike her on an equal par with how much I dislike Harry Potter (see previous post). The only thing about her that has changed my opinion of her is that now I see her slyness, and I'm warying of that. Whether she intends to be patronisingly nice, I don't know; and whether she's aware that I will proceed to take considerable advantage of said niceness, I don't know either. What I do know is this: she sure as hell ain't gonna win me over by a few friendly comments and a smile now and again, and if she thinks she can, then she's got another thing coming.   It would seem she's playing mind games... and crossing into my territory with that. "Who's for the game? ...The red crashing game of a fight?"   I am.
I went shopping today. Well, I suppose I was more rightfully 'browsing' with some friends who were shopping. Anyway, we took a trip to local high-street clothes stores H&M and New Look. Ooooooooh what fun.  Some of the items were nice. (Notice the use of that word I don't like using because of its blandness, but in this case it's apt so I'll use it). And some of the other clothes were downright horrid. Not just ugly, not just hideous, I'm talking completely outrageously kick-you-in-the-nuts painfully putrifying. And I'm not kidding.  Just for a laugh we decided to select an outfit for each other, and the results were just so wonderfully hilarious I couldn't not comment on it here:  I was given a short, pleated orange skirt with buckles, to wear in partnership with a black, tight top with no sleeves or straps, which was covered in rainbow-coloured shiny sequin-like pieces. The outfit was finished off with a lovely black hat. I looked like the Whore of Babylon, having just come out of a disco.  T, on the other hand was given a leopard-print, (extremely) tight miniskirt, and matching strappy, low-cut top. She looked like a hooker version of Bet Lynch.  Another of the concoctions I tried on was a yellow halterneck dress with a white and yellow strappy top on UNDERNEATH, and a blue denim pleated miniskirt over the top. The kind of thing you might see on a catwalk, not on me. Honestly, it gave a whole new meaning to the phrase "Kodak moment".  It makes you think though, doesn't it; do people actually wear these things casually? And if so, why? Do they honestly think it looks good? Each to his own, I suppose. But what happened to individuality, eh?   Has it come to this, that people wear such strange things just because it's in fashion, and they don't want to be considered a social reject?  Well maybe it's just me, but I'd rather be a social reject than be seen alive in some of those ghastly outfits. Now I'm off to talk to some of my other reject friends and drink tea. Y'all have a good night n
