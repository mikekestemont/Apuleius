pages per hypo.  If I don't answer my phone or return calls during that period, please don't be alarmed--not only am I not on the phone, I'm probably not eating, sleeping, or showering.  Well, I'm sure I'll eat and shower at least...not so sure about the sleeping though.  I guess we'll see.    I'm going to Boca Grande this weekend (my favorite place on the planet).  I just feel like I need to get away from here.  At home it's impossible not to get distracted, and even at the library everyone is around so it's difficult not to stop and chat.  I studied for the LSAT in Boca Grande, so at least I know I can do it.  You can't beat sitting at a table looking out at the ocean.  It's distracting, yes, but in a very calming way.  Plus, I have 7.25 hours of Criminal Law CDs to which I can listen during the drive and during any laying out I decide to do.  I won't feel guilty for wasting the time driving since I'll have those.  I'm pretty darn excited about it actually, and if we weren't having a review in Crim (and if I hadn't missed the max in Torts) I'd leave today instead of tomorrow.  But I suppose I can suffer through 3 more classes--how crazy, only three classes until my first semester is finished.  I know it's not a real semester--but hey, it's a start.  OK, enough procrastinating for now.  I've got to learn about solicitation.
Yes, I am still alive.  I have been living at the library--I spent 12 hours there three times last week.  Isn't that sad?  Of course the entire time was not spent studying--I get distracted rather easily be email or IM or random things I decide I just  have  to look up online (like study guides for next semester or new songs to download or directions on how to grill a steak {even though I don't have a grill!}).  But anyway, the point is that I have been busy preparing for finals.  I have 8 days until my first, so I will probably be MIA a lot this week.  I will try to post a longer message tomorrow.  I hope everyone has a good 4th of July!
What on earth is going on with my counter?  Last week I checked (yes, even though I didn't post...shame on me) and the counter said around 1100 hits.  Now it says over  93,000 .  I don't understand -- and I'm relatively sure it's impossible.  I can't imagine having that many hits in just a week even if multiple people linked to me.   On another note, I just haven't been doing much of anything and therefore haven't been motivated to post anything.  I will get my second grade tomorrow though (I got the first about two weeks ago) so I will post about that tomorrow evening.  Grades in law school suck.  I'm definitely not looking forward to going back now...but I'll post more about that later.  If anyone has any ideas about the counter, please let me k
