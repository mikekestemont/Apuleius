that it isn't hot AND humid, but still it is hot.  I think we should start making use of the pool again.  No one has used it since Pa left...maybe that is why.  I miss the guy, no matter how insane he can drive me, I miss him.  I wish more than anything that he were home with us, but again, I know why he has to be gone.  Another stressful day and a seemingly endless battle with migraines.  Save me.  I have called my doctor and he can't see me until the 20th...well I am not waiting that long.  So I scheduled an appointment for sometime on Wednesday. I know I am bad with times...so hopefully I will remember by then.  I think it is at ten.  I hate going to the doctor, but hey, what can you do?  So today I went to my financial aide information class.  I got a lot of information that I needed....THANK GOD!  But also found out that I am going to be screwed next year if I don't get out of the community college level.  I run the risk of losing my financial aid.  OH NO!  I really want to get this college thing done, but I can't control the health issues that have come up with me and my son.  I guess I can try and appeal.  We will see.  I was so bummed though.  I think that added onto my stress.  Oh and the lady I spoke with at financial aid gave me the wrong disbursement date.  She said that we would get our grants a week before school so we could get our books, but it seems as though they aren't coming in until a couple of weeks after school starts...hmmm...how am I going to buy my books?  Anyhow, I hope you all had a great weekend.  I know I plan on doing a lot of cleaning because my in-laws are coming this Friday.  It should be fun.
Okay I HATE migraines.  I hate the worry I am going through this past month and well I am just plain angry.  I feel trapped, like I don't have anyone to talk to, but I know I have a few good friends who have told me countless times to call them when I need.  I am too embarrassed or maybe too afraid of losing my friends.  It is the one tough thing about losing two good friends at one time, you become afraid.   like Heidi, my NJ friend, she has stuck by me through some of the toughest times in my married life and she has asked countless times to lean on her.  But I guess all these feelings of anxiety come around this time, at night and I know she has two little girls and it would not be right to call this late.  UGH  Then these miserable migraines have kept me from doing the things I need to do.  I am so  FRUSTRATED !  Anyway, that is it.  I have to talk to a bunch of doctors tomorrow.  Wish me l
