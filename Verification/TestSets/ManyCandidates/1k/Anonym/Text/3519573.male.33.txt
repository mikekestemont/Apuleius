SO the new 27" tv I bought just 4 months ago has gone to shit. Thanks, RCA, for producing and selling to me a true piece of shit. $220 out the window. I can't take it back to Wal-Mart because it is after 90 days. RCA wants me to take it to a certified tv repair man. I cant get ahold of him. Even if I did, it would cost me $60 - and there is no garentee that it will fix it. Jerks! RCA sucks - I hate RCA.
So I submitted our splash in the appropreiate directory two months ago. Still aint there. Today, I submitted all four states individually to DMOZ. We will see how long that takes.
urlLink G  is literally index our site everyday. Monday was 150 pages, Tues was 150, and yesterday was another 350. Funny thing, those are exact numbers, not estimates...wierd, eh? But G is looking to be our best friend. I can't find Slurp anywhere, lazy bum.  The whole FFA linkfarming thing still sucks. I am still at over 1000 links. Damn, I wish I didn't do that, lol. Well, it aint the end of the world.
So what's new? Lemme bring you up to speed...  So  urlLink G  has indexed 3,360 pages of  urlLink eatstayplay.com  - and that number seems to be growing daily, almost. Looks like  urlLink AOL  gets their shit straihgt from  urlLink G , I get the same answer there.  urlLink AllTheWeb  and  urlLink AltaVista  stand at just over 100 each. And  urlLink Y  is at about 122. Finally got the index into  urlLink AskJeeves  (ya damn right I did it for free) and  urlLink Teoma . The last major player I am working on is  urlLink DMOZ  - slow bastards.  As soon as I fix something on the website, something else falls apart. I forgot that sometimes, I have to reload/regen states twice - that's why Colorado looked so bad today. Then, while tinkering around with the chambers, i forgot that they is no check for double listings. By the time Leah caught this, I had all Prescott's Chambers listed like four times. Took me a full cigarette to figure out how to clear the table so i could start again.  I think we are going to scratch the whole concept of email marketing. Sure, it's cost effective - but I do not think it is worth it. Trying to gear your sales pitch through the front door of the spam checkers it a bitch. Postcards it i
