with their son.&nbsp; i'm the one who asked eric to remove the pictures from the blog.&nbsp; appearantly, the "love" and "respect" that eric claims to have for me is gone.&nbsp; the picture was taken because a picture of dan and i was taken first, and i didn't want eric to feel like he wasn't just as important to me.&nbsp; obviously this is how my gesture was rewarded.&nbsp; i'm still a spiteful bitch.&nbsp; eric also claimed in his blog that he never called dan's parents asking them to make their SON leave me alone.&nbsp; he's right.&nbsp; he threatened to kill dan instead.&nbsp;&nbsp; and for some reason, blame is still placed on dan.&nbsp; yes, he was a factor to events that have happened in the last three months, but i have chosen not to go back to eric because of his continous reactions to these events.&nbsp; we choose our own reactions.&nbsp; dan did not steal anyone away from eric.&nbsp; eric left me all on his own.&nbsp; he claims that he didn't break up with me, he just 'stepped aside,' but for some reason that was never clarified during or after the break-up to me.&nbsp; it was only clarified when he learned that someone else was interested in me.&nbsp; but yes, i do accept blame for breaking some promises that i made, and for lying about my relationship with dan.&nbsp; considering eric had already threatened dan's life and his own, i chose to hide the truth instead of telling the truth and trusting God to take care of eric.&nbsp; and for that i'm sorry.  i would also like to make a public apology to dan.&nbsp; i know that for the last three months you have watched me hurt (and yes, eric, i am capable of being hurt) and that it's hurt you to watch.&nbsp; i also know that my continued persistance to be eric's friend and to keep him in my life has hurt you to.&nbsp; i realize that for the last three months i have put him ahead of you (even though most of the time it was subconsiously) and for that i am sorry.&nbsp; you don't deserve that.&nbsp; you've even made yourself sick over all of this.&nbsp; i know that you know how badly i wanted eric in my life and how much i miss him, and i'm sorry that you have to see me hurt like this.&nbsp; we have five months until our wedding.&nbsp; i'm going to do whatever i can to make better choices and to be a better girlfriend.&nbsp; i wanted to be a better friend to him, but as he put it today, i'm only thinking about what i want.&nbsp; i'm so sorry.  i made the comment to dan about four or five months ago that these two men were the two most important people in my life, and that i was so scared that i would lose them.&nbsp; one is gone, by his choice.&nbsp; and i'll have to respect that.&nbsp; but he made the remark the other day that i didn't look happy.&nbsp; now he knows w
