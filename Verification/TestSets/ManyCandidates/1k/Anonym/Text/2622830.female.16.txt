you can tell  All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me  All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me...
Today was alright.&nbsp;I&nbsp;sat around watching tv for a while then when&nbsp;Nick got out of work and I showered and stuff he brought me to the Hospital where I applied for a job and picked up a volunteer packet for my sister. Then after that we went to Evergreen so I could apply for a job there also. Hopefully I hear from one place and get hired. I could use a job. It would give me money which I need and something to do. After that Nick brought me home and I went online and watched tv and ate dinner with my family (havent done that in a loooonnnngggg time). Then I went online again and talked to Jay. Then Beth and Trainor picked me up and we went back to their place where I hung out with them and Jay. Now I am home and Boy Meets World is on soon so I will probably watch that and then maybe go to sleep.
Well I have nothing to do. This summer is going good I guess.&nbsp;I havent done much, just alot of hanging out with people and sitting home. This past weekend was pretty good though. I got a season pass for Six Flags last week so I am hoping to go there soon. Today I am going to go apply for a job at the hospital and maybe Evergreen too. Im not sure yet. I wish it was sunny and nice out cuz I want to get&nbsp;tanner.
This weekend was a good one. Friday during the day I ended up playing basketball with Andy and few others. It was cool. I hadnt hung out with Andy in a while. This weekend was fun but I dont feel like going in to too much detail about it. I got to hang out with a couple people that I havent hung out with or seen in a while. Im now home. I left Friday. It was nice to not be at home for a couple days. Tomorrow I go to the dentist which should be fun. Hah. But for right now I am gonna go upstairs read my magazine, maybe watch some tv, and go to sleep in my own bed. :)
I  love Katie so much  that I am wasting my valuable time to make a post all about how much I love her. So ya, I love her so much that I am posting about it.      :-P
Just so everyone knows, my most recent post on  urlLink my blogger  'sucks ass' according to the eloquent schmeghan.  YUP!  P.S.- This one probably sucks too!
I figured I would post. Just something to do. I went swimming yesterday at Bigalow with Jay, Nick, and Crystal after Jay got home from work. It was fun but cold. I dont know what I am doing today. Tomorrow Crystal and I are going to Six Flags. It should be fun. This weekend should be fun. Time to go make something to eat. Im h
