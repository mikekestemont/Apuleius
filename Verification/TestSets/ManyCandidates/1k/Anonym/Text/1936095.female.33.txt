above, George W. has the nerve to start a campaign in which he claims the "W" in his name stands for "Women."  I can see how that would be true - if he means it stands for the  Women  he's let die in Africa because he wouldn't turn over the  urlLink United Nations Population Fund's $34 million  to prevent  Women  dying of AIDS and  urlLink fistula  and in childbirth and due to illegal and unsanitary abortions. It might stand for  those   Women .   It might stand for the millions of American  Women  he's betrayed, by rolling reproductive rights back to the 14th century, restricting access to abortion and emergency contraception, telling Women that abortion causes breast cancer, which the American Cancer Society's Data proves is an outright lie.   How about the young Women, who he has decided are too young to take a pill to prevent pregnancy - but are apparently old enough to be mothers. Or the ones subjected to his "abstinence only" sex education, whose teachers aren't allowed to tell them anything about birth control except its failure rate.   And don't lets forget the thousands of  Women  whose brothers and sons and husbands are dying in Iraq in a stupid war that he lied to us about and based on fictional Weapons of Mass Destruction. Oh yeah - there are  Women  over there too, dying in that war, and now facing the possibilty of being captured and sexually tortured in retaliation for Abu Ghraib.   Oh yeah, the "W" stands for those  Women.    I don't know about you, but hearing about this makes me want to become a "WMD" - a  Woman of Mass Destruction . If by "Mass" you mean the millions of us who are outrageously pissed at his balls in starting this campaign, and by "Destruction" you mean the total, resounding and humiliating defeat of "W" at the polls in November (always assuming that he and his friends haven't  urlLink banned us from the registered voter list , or hijacked the  urlLink e-voting )  You with me?
urlLink Yahoo! News - Unhappy Workers Should Take Prozac --Bush Campaigner   Yeah, so they can't get a new job, cuz there aren't any, and they can't take the Prozac because their health insurance either doesn't exist or doesn't cover it. So, let them eat cake I guess, huh?
urlLink www.bodyasbillboard.com   Dear bodyasbillboard,  I saw your t-shirt in Ms. magazine and visited your site the same day because I wanted to buy one. Obviously you're a feminist organization, all about empowering women. Great. But WHY OH WHY (like so many other sites which are supposedly "pro-woman") are you only about empowering women in sizes S-M-L? I am a large woman - I need  at least  an XL.   I want you to hear me.    ****I EXIST****    So do a lot of other women like me who are unable to take part in your campaign.   Please try to empower and include ALL women. Not just the dinky ones.   Fed well and fed up,   Nerdgrrl
Argh. Just argh.   I hate the world sometimes.   Most of the t
