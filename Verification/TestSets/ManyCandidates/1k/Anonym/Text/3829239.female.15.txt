me anymore. She said it's one of the most horrible feelings in the world, and to me it felt like shit hearing her say that. Adan kissing me at the movies, and me kissing back is at the top of my list of the most stupid things that I've done. I'm not stupid, and I've noticed that ever since Jeanette found out about that day she's acted different towards me. It seems as if she is holding back anger, and she's rude to me. That's the whole reason I slapped her, I didn't mean to slap her hard, it's just that she was being rude, and I was tired of her being rude to me...it's how she's been for a while. I had already told her that there was something wrong with her lately, but I was trying to just shake it off I guess. Well I can in a way understand that it bothered her that we kissed, but it's not like she's with him. She was with him for a day....and then it's not my fault that he was so hurt that I dumped him after we had only been seeing eachother for two weeks. It was two weeks! That's all.....it hardly even counts as a relationship, actually to me it doesn't at all, let alone   one   day.
Jeanette came over yesterday, we completed the scrapbook! Wow, it was jam packed, and we couldn't fit anything else in it, which is partly why we finished. We had lots more to fill it up with, but oh well. Well Camille stopped by later and spent the night here. I dyed her hair, and then straightened it while watching Nightmare Before Christmas for the first time believe it or not! Okay, the movie isn't even all that great, why does everyone make such a big deal out of it? Anyway, today we went to Six Flags, it was Jeanette, Camille, Alek, and me. Boy, oh boy, Alek has a nice bod. We saw a bunch of Adan's friends there......including Elias. His hair looked nice. They were on the train when we saw them, and I think only Eric noticed us, but I don't really care. Aww, it was so cute Alek and me sat on this boulder type thing and watched fireworks during the Lone Star Spectacular, or whatever it's called, anyway, yea it was cute. Jeanette told me afterwards, "I just want you to know that that was one of the best experiences I've ever had, just watching you two sitting on the rock, and then you pushing him off was cool," or something along those lines..........real nice. On the way to drop off Alek back home we were dancing and singing in the car, which was fun, though it didn't last very long.... Then I took his hat, and he told me to hold it for him until Friday when I see him at registration, and he asked me to wash it, what's up with that? ha. Well I'm hungry, so I'm outta here, catch ya on the flip f
