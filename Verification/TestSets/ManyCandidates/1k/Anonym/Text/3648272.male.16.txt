society today, no one is like that. We have contaminated ourselves with fast food, and pretty much everything else. Now, even with top-of-the-line medicine/technology, the average American does not live past 80. And even then we usually sit in wheel chairs or have various health problems. This guy was completely healthy.   This guy is almost like a role-model to me. I would much rather be healthy and active in 60 or 70 years than suffer from various health problems. I know a lot of people probably feel hatred towards those who were blessed with super metabolisms and don’t gain anything from what they eat, despite what they eat. You might see some of these people consume the unhealthiest foods and still remain in good shape. I bet you probably hate then. Well don’t bother. What these people fail to realize is that their super metabolisms don’t last forever. With every passing decade, your metabolic rate decreases by 10%. That’s 1% a year for those who are mathematically challenged.  Which means, that there super metabolisms won’t last forever, but there unhealthy habits will last a very long time because it’s already programmed into their minds in a subconscious level. Why do you think so many fat 40 year-old Americans try all diets and fail? It’s because they have been eating poorly there whole lives and these habits have been engraved into their mind at the subconscious level, so despite their most sincere efforts they will always set themselves up to fail in the long run. I would also like to mention that those with super metabolisms may not be gaining weight in there early years, but they are damaging all of their bodily organs and blood, not to mention overall health. I’m sure some of these people suffer from cholesterol problems and other medical issues. The fact is that nature did not design the human body to consume more than half the foods you see in an ordinary super market. All though these people may be eating whatever they want and not gaining anything, they are damaging their body and after they hit 30 they will feel the effects of their bad decisions. By eating any snack that you see in a store, like fruit rollup for example, what are you actually doing? In essence you are putting chemicals into your body, chemicals that were not meant to ever be digested, by our bodies. These chemicals do damage over time, and we only feel the affects after a certain number of years.   So to sum it all up. Why do I do what I do?  1. Girls 2. Gives me a sense of accomplishment 3. To stay healthy  WOW that was really long. Feel free to leave any comments, but don’t bother bashing this post. Nothing ANYONE can say will change my regimen. With every passing day, what I do becomes easier and more natural. Sometimes when I look at pizza I don’t even want to eat it anymore knowing that it’s just no good. So that’s it for this long p
