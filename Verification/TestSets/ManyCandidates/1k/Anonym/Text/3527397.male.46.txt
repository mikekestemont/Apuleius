We must see this through! We either pacify the mid-east now or we do it later at a much higher cost.  Don't cry for terrorists remember 911 they started this fight and we must end it if we have to kill 100 million of them.

When oh when will they reach the IT field, ay? I have been preparing, getting my long over due A+ and Network+ certifications. I am now working on my MCP(WindowsXP).

I'm feeling much better today...Thank you my Higher Power. Cruising toward 4 mos. sober and I fall into depression. On the bright side I did not want to drink. I just feel bad for the people that have to deal with me. But! When I'm good I'm real good!  I realize that the day at a time approach is the only way to go.

This should be a trip! Ineed to share my thoughts as I have reached a point in my life that requires serious eval.  Stay tuned.
and so forth. Never believe everything you read in a m
