world over
I am just sure that  Garden State  is going to be an amazing movie. Usually movie previews are so predictable and so gung-ho (well, that’s the point, really) that even the better looking films barely get my excited. But this movie looks different. I don’t really know much about the adorable actor/writer/director Zach Braff, but it’s safe to say I will be seeing this movie. In fact, I’m excited, actually enthusiastic, about seeing it.  I cannot say the same for  urlLink Christmas with the Kranks . Dude, someone has to tell Tim Allen to stop doing Christmas movies.  I thought it might be fun today to make a list of all the CDs I should own but haven’t gotten around to actually purchasing, legally. For some reason the idea struck me as fun. But the list grew ridiculously long, and somewhere between  Between the Buttons  and  You Can Play These Songs with Cords , I became disgusted with myself.  Colin Firth, I love you and your reindeer jum-pah. I’d run around in my skivvies for you anytime.  Affectionately… Anna
Napoleon Dynamite  is the funniest movie I have ever seen. And I mean that; it’s funnier than  Heavy Weights ,  Zoolander , and-no joke-  Spinal Tap . I can’t remember the last time I’ve laughed so hard anywhere. I don’t know if I have  ever  laughed that hard. I’m using incredible amounts of restraint not to just make one entire post of quotes. But if you haven’t seen it,  freakin' do it, GOSH !  Other than being sleepy, and broke, I am happy. Robin is home, Lauren is back, and there was the most beautiful thunderstorm last night. Set to Coldplay, Death Cab for Cutie, and, randomly, Coltrane it was amazing. My heart feels inflated.  Affectionately… Anna
Oh. My. God. I am so glad I lived to see the day that I would discover Tilly and the Wall.  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Sometimes when I am driving with my mother I think about how easy it would be to ram the car through a row of parked cars. On the passenger side.  ROBIN HOME TOMORROW!
I fear for my future husband.  I simply can not function for a week unless I have one of the following; a heart to heart, a make out session, cuddling, or something to cry about. How sick is that? I can’t even substitute music for any of the aforementioned. It’s like, I need something to feel, even if it’s total sluttiness or sadness. Those things remind me that I’m alive.  If I were stranded on a desert island, which is admittedly unlikely, my heart would implode. I need people to obsess about. I need people’s hair to pet and people to giggle with. I need people who will jump on trampolines with me in the middle of the night. And no matter what accommodations said island had, a lack of laughter or discussion or sighing would cause cardiac arrest.  I am going to blame bad writing, the last two months of shitty writing, on boys. Just the gender in general.  Affectionately… A
