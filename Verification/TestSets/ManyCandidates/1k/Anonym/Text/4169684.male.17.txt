pain and sorrow That he will soon come to live with  Whether he chooses to accept Or be blinded by your words My hope has become clear As I only wish he sees you for who you really are  As the person I've come to know A harlot, and bitch who lives with deceit It seems as though you speak freely and care not But how can the word Love flow so freely with you?  You have crushed one soul already And if soon not another, then I only hope it never learns As the truth can be hurtful as it is aged with time But when it comes down to it, The truth is still the truth Whether you choose to live by it or not...
You know what? Fuck it I've given up everything for you  My time, my love and my life Yet somehow it wasn't enough Instead you felt that you could lie to me Cheating me out of my happiness While not forgetting of others  I've been used, and now lay with a knife in my back I'd pull it out, but I fear of my emotions spilling on the floor The knife, it now holds me together As the pain helps me realize how much of a fool I was And will never be again  These mixed feelings of pain and wanting Need only see the repercussions of your actions As I see you've stepped on my heart With your new nine inch, spiked heel shoes So with no heart, I wish to leave you with these words  Good luck finding someone who feels for you the way I did Good luck with looking at yourself in the mirror every morning As you realize what it is you actually did And lastly, good luck living your life as a lie  As I might not have been everything you were looking for But I had one thing you could've used As a conscience could have been useful in this matter Where your contradictory ways won't seem to flatter  I hope your happy now, cause I know I'll soon be As one day this knife in my back Will soon be marked "return to sender" And believe me, it will hurt more than you know
Have you ever felt like this before? The feeling of where you have so much to tell Yet no one to speak to? Where you feel you could give so much Yet you have no one to give it to?  With life fucking you from behind Taking away from you, your very innocence You realize that all life is, is time  Time spent at home Time spent alone Time spent wondering what you've done Time spent thinking And time spent drinking Time you spent making the past undone  Yet soon you come to realize that life is unfair As it reaps upon the benefits of your misfortunes Unjustly taken, while you are left to mourn As life takes a look and laughs to see your heart has been torn
