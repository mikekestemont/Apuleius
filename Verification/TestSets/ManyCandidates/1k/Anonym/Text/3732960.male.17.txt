12, and 16 years old anymore! we're 17, 19, and 23! we all have more important things to do LIKE OUR JOBS than his yard work. I have summer school every day, and then most of those days, i have to go to work a couple hours later! and then on the weekends im either working one job or the other, or both! i dont have time to do that shit and he knows it. seriously, he just likes bitching and acting like no one is useful except himself, and its really fucking annoying. Im sick of him telling me how im useless and getting a "free ride" because when i was younger, we busted ass helping him with stuff. Sorry dad, that we have lives now.
Yesterday me and kathy went to lunch after summer school... yes i know, subway is so romantic. Then i went home and slept and she went shopping and to get Sally fixed. When i woke up and got ready, we headed to summerfest. we'd panned on seeing switchfoot. then we decided to keep our options open, cuz we'd both heard "meant to live" 100000 times on the radio, so we were debating between switchfoot, dashboard confessional, and trapt.

I made myself a drink (which i'd wanted to do all night) and then kathy decided she should go, cuz she had to work this morning at 9... poor kathy. **Dumbest License Plate: "GV THNX 2"  Thursday I went to school, came home and slept, went to work, then came home and did nothing.  Wednesday I honestly can't even remember what I did.  Tuesday I went to school, then went to kathy's right after and she made me lunch. Then we were bored and decided to go to Soundwaves, then to the mall... i made 4$ (kathy made 6$) take a survey at the mall... it was pretty worth it, cept the lady asking the questions was a fucking c
