too.  See ya!
I know you all have missed me.  It's hard not to.  My continuous habit of Blogging suddenly stopped due to my long, much hated vacation to the New York state.  But now, I have returned, and I'm not going anywhere...except school on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday for both senior pictures and a "special presentation" that I'm working on for the assistant principal for the freshman orientation that is on Thursday night.  Being home, though, never felt better.  This vacation (which, to me, seemed more like putting me through hell than a vacation), overall, dragged on forever, but, there were a couple things that were pretty cool, like getting to stop at the Paramount Carowinds theme park in South/North Carolina (the park goes through both states), the Busch Gardens in Williamsburg, VA, and that's it!  I did get to see one of my friends that I haven't seen in 5 years (lives in Virginia, my mom and his mom went to school together, therefore, I've known this kid all my life), and that was pretty cool.  And then, this morning, we headed back here to The River, and I couldn't be any happier to be back.   Anyway, the main purpose of me and the parentals (and the siblings, of course) driving to New York was the fact that I would be bringing back my new car (1998 Toyota Corolla...its green, and I don't like green very much), but, of course, what had to happen?  No car came back.  My parents decided that "they'll fly up in a month and pick it up so that we don't have to worry about dinging it on the way back."  Doesn't that irritate you how parents do that?  Well, they also decided to start driving up every time we go, and I'm thinking, "Hell no, by Christmas time, I'll have my license, so I'll drive to the airport, fly up there, and have my aunt or someone pick me up."  No way will I ever drive back up there.  It's too long of a drive, and my brother is too annoying to deal with for 22 hours.  Things are going to be different this month on Blog of Bagel.  What exactly is going to be different, I'll have to make up my mind on that tomorrow.  But, let me assure you, that school is NOT going to slow me down on the great and mighty Blogger.  No sir.  No it won't.  I'm not going to have this blog slow down because of stupid school.  But, now, I'm really tired, it was a long ride back to The River, so I'm turning in for the night.  Things go back to normal tomorrow, so expect my regular update schedule once again.  Oh, for those few individuals who may be wondering, I'm not in that same particular bad mood that lasted pretty much throughout Yearbook camp anymore.  Want details?  Instant Message me (the bagel05 on AIM), and I'll tell you, but, only, if you were with me at Camp Orlando.  But, nothing until tomorrow.  Need sleep.  A
