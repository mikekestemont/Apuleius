history. A sevral year war turned into....12 days. The lack of immortality, and the cheesiest line of the year : "the god's, they envy us because we can die, feel pain, and love." Or something along those lines. It was teh suck. Overall : 4/10  Now people tell me Riddick was the best movie, and I slap them. These peices of shit movies don't deserve to be played on big screens. THey suck, with bad acting, and more concern for digital effects than a story, I cry. The same with 2 fast 2 furious, I didn't even watch it. I hate pop movies, like the fast and furious series, the riddick series, the chick flicks, the over rated police movies (i.e: SWAT). I can't take it. I have seen so many good American Movies, in fact, I have been keeping a record, and am running on roughly 411 hours of movies. (that doesn't include the ones I forgot). So total probably about 500-600 hours. I've seen se many American movies, I have started in the foreign business. I watched Les Pactes Des Loups, one of my favorite movies, (The Brotherhood of the wolf), Battle Royale, a sick japanese movie that just flat out rocks, Battle Royale II, same thing, The seven samurai, on my top 5 list, and Wasabi, a kick ass Japanese French movie. All these movies are great, why can't America learn a thing or two? I'll tell you, rap, pimp my ride, collumbine, and teen suicide, all these things stop American movies from growing to their full potential. When you have people who just want guns and bitches (rap) in their movies, the media delivers half assed movies that a 3 year old could understand. When we have movies based soley on Cars, well that just sucks. You have Coullmbine, which stops movies with kids holding guns in them from ever being released state side. (Battle Royale, Battle Royale II). The Teen suicide thing keeps truly moving movies, that would make you depressed for a while, and things that show reasons to die being released, because the kids might be influenced. Me and a friend decided to make sure that we would make a movie here so that it would be known as not only awsome, but completely breaking the rules. What happens? It gets canceled. Why? Because our parents said that if we made a contorversial movie with teens fighting, then other teens will reinact it, and kill their friends. I was like WTF! Just because some deranged lunatics killed their peers at highschool doesn't mean everybnody who sees our movie will. Either way it got canceled. So instead we are making a movie about a serial killer and a bumch of kids who have to escape. Sounds like your normal slasher eh? Not, I made sure when writing the script to insure that it will be like nothing you've ever seen before, when it gets done, I'll start taking orders. Well for now, I have to go eat my Ramens, and shoot some peers. (not r
