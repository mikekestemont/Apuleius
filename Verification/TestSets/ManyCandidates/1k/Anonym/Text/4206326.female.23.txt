verified a nasty habit that a good portion of the population is acustomed to. We seem to all be on auto-piolet. we prepare to answer the questiones that we exspect will come, not the ones that are asked. This lack of living beyond ones-self was what I exspected, but to a degree I didn't see comming.   Oddly enogh, it was another customer that brought the next idea to mind. A young girl, who reportedly never stopped talking before, had shaved her head and apparently taken a vow of silence. The concept of bending your whole will to listening and contemplatling that wich surrounds you is very enticing. Then eventually only speaking when you've got something that isn't automatic and empty to say. It sounds obvious and yet, impossible at the same time.
Today I sit wondering at the probable. The probable is never going to happen unless it becomes inevitable, wich is often what is least likely to happen.   If you've ever taken a vation you'll know exsactly what that means. You joke about how the airline will probably loose your luggege, but rationalize this fear away using the logic that out of all the people traveling, your highly unlikely to be chosen as the butt of the univeres jokes today. Somehow the Gods hear this. When I say the Gods you may input any intangible intelliegent and persuasive entity you like, be it the Goddess, Jesus, or the Cosmic Muffin. Again, the cosmic muffin is very unlikly to be what us silly humans having been killing and dying for, but you know how wrong you were about your luggage too. As I was saying the Gods hear your prayers, and as logical as it would be to belive, hope and wish that these Gods ansewer those prayers with good outcomes, it's simply more probably that this is one of those life oppratuniies your Highschool Counslor told you about. This is about growth, and if there is any nonfalacious reason for killing and dying over a god it's because he/she/it made you grow against your will and you were not amused to an extreem degree.  I've been told over and over again that if growth were easy everyone would do it. That is not a lie, it's just a clever way to end the sentance prematurely. If growth were easy, everyone would do it, but it sucks the life and hope out of you and when you wake up in a dark bleary hole looking up at the refracting light of the life you've spotted glinting above you, you keep swimming twords it, even though you know you've got no air, no chance to reaching it - It's too beautiful to give up. It's Joy quatified and mesured. Because that life on the other side of the surface is always clean, clear and complete. There is an inherint problem with that logic, and it's not that there is always another side of that surface - like a horizon you'll never reach. The problem is that it's the truth. And the truth s
