deeper and deeper into crisis, culminating in massive benefit cuts, bankruptcy and, ultimately, taxpayer bailout on a mammoth scale.  If you're under 40, this is what you can look forward to without privitization. This is exactly what will happen to Social Security, for exactly the same reasons, unless major changes are adopted immediately.   UPDATE:  Apparently the  Times  editorial board doesn't read its own paper -- they're a week late and a thesis short with  urlLink this empty editorial  on the PBGC.

urlLink Obernews  alerts us to  urlLink a stunning eminent domain victory  in Michigan:   Reversing more than two decades of land-use law, the Michigan Supreme Court late Friday overturned its own landmark 1981  Poletown  decision and sharply restricted governments such as Detroit and Wayne County from seizing private land to give to other private users.  The unanimous decision is a decisive victory for property owners who object to the government seizing their land, only to give it to another private owner to build stadiums, theaters, factories, housing subdivisions and other economic development projects the government deems worthwhile.  The decision is based on Michigan constitutional law, so its precedential value elsewhere is limited. It's significant, however, in that apparently Michigan was the most egregious ignorer of the basic  urlLink Takings Clause  rule (i.e., "you may take private land for  public use , but never for  private use by someone else "). It's also relatively rare to see any supreme court, SCOTUS or state, summarily sweep away twenty years of bad law (appellate courts tend to be very incrementalist, even in backpedaling).  Of course, the spirit of the Takings Clause has been almost completely eviscerated in modern times through what I call "  near-takings  ," such as excessive zoning, environmental regulation, the Endangered Species Act, etc., etc. etc. The most notorious examples currently are  urlLink smoking ban confiscatorians ; see also the (small-c) communists in  urlLink King County, Washington .

Need a reminder of how bass-ackward the Vatican is? Read  urlLink this :   The Vatican on Saturday denounced feminism for trying to blur differences between men and women and threatening the institution of families based on a mother and a father. ... The concerns, raised in a 37-page document written by one of Pope John Paul II's closest aides, broke no new ground, maintaining the Roman Catholic Church's ban on women priests, for example. ... The document also took issue with a "certain type of feminist rhetoric" that   makes "demands 'for ourselves.'  " .. The Rev. Thomas Reese, a commentator on the Catholic church, said in an e-mailed statement that "although most American feminists would express their theology differently from the Vatican, on the practical level, they are on the same page (in terms of equality in education, politics, workplace)   except on abortion and women priests  ." [  Details, details...]   ... The document also expressed the Vatican's concern that   blurring of differences between sexes could pose a challenge to church teaching  ..."  Really? What a surprise...  P.S. Don't understand the title?  Read  urlLink here .
