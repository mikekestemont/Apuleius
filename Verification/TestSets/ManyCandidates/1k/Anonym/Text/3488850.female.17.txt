down to singapore river, sat by the side...  We chatted.  And it happened... This was the first time he said how much he liked me... I was very touched to hear that, because he finally showed his trueself, he expressed.  I always love him, beacuse i never hate anyone.  I didn't show my feelings to him, because i didn't know whether he felt that way. {insecure } But this night, i can really feel love...   [ Now, i can take the fact that he wont message me for anything, except for fixing date and time to go out together. because this is the way he is. ]  Hmm... maybe with his new look, he looks more 'guai'. hehez, in the sense, cute to me...  the moment i see him, my heart really melts... and can forget about any worry in mind...   i want to say  " thank you" to him...

Today, I was woke up by a SMS sent by my poly senoir.  She informed me that there will be practise today.  Finally, after a few times of her informing me of the practise, this time, i decided to turn up.  In this club, there's so many feelings which I do not like to feel.  1) Feeling lost. Because this is a club that does with playing an instrument. Our instructor does not teach us much theory. He just prepares us ready for performances. Well, it's true, for theory, we can seek our seniors for help... But I'm not very close with them. It's psychology... the way i think.  2) "He" is a senoir of this club. Do not know why he approached me, and then we were paired. IT's very " xin ku ". He likes to 'play' around with girls. And do you call that flirt? Some agree. Doesnt he know that I am there, helplessly, watching his kind of ways... This is a big reason why I will not want to go back school for practise.   3) Lonely. I learn well, with friends around... As you know, "friends" is always the magic word when you are having life outside your home.   4) I am busy with another music. It's my church choir. I am going to participate in the Eucharistic Congress choir. There's lots of songs for me to learn. So, i usually practise them at home with my keyboard. What makes it difficult is that i'm singing the Alto part, where the keys are much lower.   Yupz, some personal reasons...  Talking about "him"...  I dont know what kind of partner he is. He cant be that busy until he does not even have time to at least send a greeting message. Ridiculous though... the last time we met, I'm the one who initated to meet up. IF i wont, i think we have not meet for 3 weeks. I just dislike the way he 'neglect' me... Does he take me for granted? Ahh.... this week, i shall not make any first move,which i hate. If he does not contact me, then let it b
