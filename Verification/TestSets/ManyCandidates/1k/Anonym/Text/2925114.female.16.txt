knee. I ranted to her. Chris must have been told that I was freaking out outside because he came outside to calm me down. I talked to him for a while. Age came out...which made it worse. I just screamed at her and cried. Then I just walked away from her...went to the fire. Layed down infront of it with Chris, ranted and raved for a bit. Then Age came and told me that when she went back upstairs and opened the door, Liam and Meliss were making out! HAH.    Hrmmm then, I remember sitting in Angus's room again with Calista, Emily, Angus, and Chris, oh and drugs. Then I left because I was going to throw up. I ran downstairs and Scott Duchersac (haha nice spelling huh?..someone please correct that.) I guess he saw the look on my face because he came outside with me and helped me out.   Then I hung out in the bathroom with Meliss and Age. I sat on the toilet, Meliss was in the tub, and Age was sitting agianst the wall..just chatting. Hmm then they wanted to go downstairs so I followed, puked again, ran into the bathroom to puke some more. Poor stairs...dont worry I cleaned up... Then somehow I found Chris again. We both had to pee so we took turns. But apparantley as I was waiting for him to be done I passed out on the floor.   He came out and woke me up and then we both ended up passing out. Then we woke up and went out to the car to shleepay.   In the morning Calista was talking about how cute we looked passed out togehter...how cute can that be? And everyone at the party had passed by us at a certain point in the party. Some Danielle girl said, yah I took a picture of you guys because it was cute....creepy. Still I'd like to see that picture, lol. Well that's it.   Left in the morning to eat at the Springbrook Restaurant. Chris drove me and Age to my house, we all hung out together. Then we drove Age home and I went to Chris's for the day, and the next day I gave him his b-day present early.   Two tickets to Deep Purple feat. Joe Satriani and Thin Lizzy, in Toronto, a Pink Floyd t-shirt from Atomic, and a picture of us for when he moves away. awww lol. He loved it, I really wish I had a camera, he was very happy. Well that's all I really feel liek updating everyone on so cheerio.  Tah, Ness
