can take to cool your core body temperature, that would be the shit!  where can i buy that mist contraption?  i'll probably need it tonight at daca's (fuckin' sauna).  heat sucks, i wish it would snow tonight.
there's nothing better than being able to accomplish multiple goals in a single time frame.  quinton "rampage" jackson manages to score a gazillion points, knockout ricardo arona with a dibilitating power bomb, and incurs a gash just above his right eye that easily sows up with 40 stitches.  now that's efficiency!!!     support the black man.
i can't!  i can't!
i guess that could be considered a problem... if you ever rub me the wrong way, you're screwed.  some of you might know what i'm talking about, it only takes one incident and i'm never gonna forget.  i could give a few examples, but some of you might read this and not want to be my friend anymore.  ...but then again, i probably wouldn't really give a shit!
wake up sweetie, it's your birthday!!!
my face has started to peel.  i figure it's just a matter of time before my chest, sholders, and back will follow suit.  i wonder how all the chafing from my golf bag tomorrow will aid in that process.  my skin feels like dry leather.
the perfect seat for a birthday boy, an old toilet sitting in an alley.     although the long (super long) weekend ended with the need to cover my body in aloe every 2 hours, it was fun nonetheless.  playing hookie from work, poker @ lex's, golf on canada day, bbq @ pat's, playing with kyla, shopping with jeanne, lounging @ sof's, kitchening with kent, bbq @ eva's, splashdown with the triple A crewette for charlene's bday, bbq @ john's, all capped off with an alienz game of a-s-s 'til 1am.  good clean fun!!!    this, on the other hand, is straight up dirty chug styles.  (he even put the lid up!!!)
ever spend 8 hours in the sun at splashdown without having any sunblock touch your skin?  i didn't know my skin could look as red as it currently does.  last night we were out on the deck and my legs and arms were feeling chilly, but my chest, shoulders and back were on fire!!!
guess who has 2 teeth that just popped out...     hi kyla!!!
today.  hien and i go walk and buy.  sorry i no want sari!  i buy hien cup, she drink coffee in cup.  what up bee-otch?
i think i'll post as if i'm the japanese guy that didn't like the singer cuz of her "small boob".  hi, am in toronto.  there is a lots of black, not like vancouver no black.  everywhere you take bus is jetsgo.  jetsgo on jane street.  the black on the subway sit quietly but i know they have gun.  don't shoot me, i can not run, hurt legs from "what the???" downhill-uphill  swim hike.  it's hot it's cold it's rain it's wind, toronto weather is fishy but not smell like fecal chloroform in creek false.  oh, and hien like a bug.  i take shots and put in s
