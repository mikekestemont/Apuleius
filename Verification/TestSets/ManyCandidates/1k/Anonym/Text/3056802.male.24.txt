 Today's quote of the blog I picked up in my travels, and and believe it in it's entirety.  Read on...  "Love is friendship set on fire!"  And on that note we end today's ramblings once more...  Your faithful blogger (it's the trusth I swear it)  Brett
A New Life, A New Leaf   Well boys n girls, looks like this blog is gonna start kicking again, lots of stuff to put down, all with little to no importance... that's how it's sposed to be right.  I will on occassion put stuff up that warrants some merit on occassion though.  Cuz I can.. and don't argue.  Well I've got the new apartment, and fuck me is she clean now, I mean, I don't think this thing has ever been this clean... I'm a cleaning machine.  Trying to get a kitty to share my space with... yeah it's gonna take some time... but I have all the faith in the world in me. and the poor potential animal that gets to share my screwed up sleeping habits with.  I'm single now... much to my disgust, but still in love with the girl, however she needs her space and I respect that, and respect her even more, albeit some would question my decisions.  Whoever said I was normal, come to think of it I don't think anyone ever has, but hey that's a good thing right.  I'm living life and trying to look at things in a whole new way... slowly but surely we all progress.  For todays quote of the blog I submit to you with humble sincerity and love the following, intended for that one person out there, that may or may not read this...  "If I could be anything, I would be your tear so I could be born in your eye, live down your cheek, and die on your lips"  Much Love to you all...  Brett
Loving the Dream     What is the greatest thing in life... that is a question many people wish to know the answer to, and for every person out there I believe it is different.  If you find something beyond reasonable greatness, and realise it and accept it, do you take it at face value and just appreciate it on a daily basis, or do you do what human nature dictates and question when it'll all be over.  When will it end, and will you be left without the wonder that that thing brought you?  Adjustment is a thing every person is capable of, but should people adjust all the time, when does it become too painful to adjust, or to change.  Are we all capable of change, the little things yes, but the big things... when there is a problem that will affect your life for the remainder of it, can something HUGE change, can something be done to solve the problem.  I think whether mentally or physically it's possible, however I may be wrong.  Please god don't let me be wrong... I don't think I can take much more of things going wrong...  Ciao...  Jungle Bunny L
