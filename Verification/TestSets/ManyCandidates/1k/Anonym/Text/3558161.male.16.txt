fuck with me, I'm crazy.   So speaking of these 'big and strong' individuals, some choosing to fight with fists, and some even with words, these truly shallow beings that are mocking depth are the ones that are my targets.  To truly hate this breed of human, the shallow and invincible, the false smiles and lies and stories they tell, and the ones that attempt to interfere, will fall first.  Those who ruin others' lives, those who hurt others, tell great tales and pretend they know just how you feel, that they are in the same position and always will be, that they are just like you, they will fall first.   To enter a domain that is sacred, to interfere, will be the death of you.  CG
The most important things are the hardest things to say. They are the things you get ashamed of, becuase words diminish them--words shrink things that seemed limitless when they were in your head to no more than living size when they're brought out. But it's more than that, isn't it? The most important things lie too close to wherever your secret heart is buried, like landmarks to a treasure your enemies would love to steal away. And you may make revelations that cost you dearly only to have people look at you in a funny way, not understanding what you've said at all, or why you thought it was so important that you almost cried while you were saying it.

Well, I've finally cleared up all that needs to be cleared up.  I have found myself, and found everyone else out.  And I think that I can be content with how things are now, 'other people-wise', and very happy continuing on, although things didn't end up going my way. Life will leave you with your head in your hands all too often. But to dwell on the worst for so long is long enough, and it's most definitely time for me to move on and see what else is out there, even if it means giving up one of the used-to-be greatest things I had.  I won't be online often, I'm surprised I found the time to update.  I extend my thanks to a few people:  Justin Christine Cate And myself, for putting everything into perspective and into the back of my head for a while, so I can enjoy what I do have. I suppose that, more than anything, I'm happy I'm not bound into something that would eventually ruin me anyways.  I sincerely hope the happiest for you and your newfound happiness.   They call me Mr. Marlboro.     It will all work out in the end, for me, at l
