hear that I spent almost 2 dollars on a Tekken 3 game trying to beat this computer.  I was so mad because I couldn't beat this one guy on there.  Quarter after Quarter and there was no advancement in my getting any closer to killing this guy.  I gave up and stomped off to my hotel room mad.

Listening to: Jojo - Use My Shoulder Current thoughts: ...dunno, cookies taste gooooood Mood: happy  Man was I stupid.  I walked into Taco Bell.  Well...the door opens RIGHT onto my knee and I almost yelled out "F*ck!" But I said it under my breath and instead of yelling I grabbed the edge of the trashcan and started laughing.  LAUGHING?!  It's my defense mechanism for when I get hurt.  6th grade falling out of my desk, couldn't quit laughing.  And that was in front of my crush then.  Then again later on in that grade I thought I was short enough to run under the volleyball net and then I ran right into it in front of my crush AGAIN.  I started laughing then too, then ran to the girls dressing room cuz I was embarassed.  I had fun, my cousin Aaron can't say Nina so he says "Nini" (as you can hear from the audioblog).  He punched me in the eye, and threw a hat at me.  I paid him back by throwing the hat at his head.  He wasn't happy and he ran under the table hiding.   k LaterZ  ~*~Nina~*~  ps...GILMORE GIRLS RULES!  (disc 1/6)
