my dress going up to my face. It was humiliating rather than satisfying. And all the time, the only thing that i can remember is G. Well.. it was actually G and the artist.  Mostly G. The artist is just the image i see between the gap. And this "D" guy? Ugh. Suddenly he becomes this thing i dont want to look at.  Let alone think about. H e finished up panting, and murmured what a great girl i am and then asked if he can see me again.  Took me a while to answer. I mean, i dont think i like this guy, no matter how cute he is.  But the thought of doing this with the most sought after man is quite tempting, I must say.    I looked at him, quietly said to myself,  oh what a beutiful meaningless creature panting infront of me. But I have zero attraction to him. Yet here i am. Bone-ing him.  which makes me wonder. why the hell, i couldnt even say yes to dinner with this artist that i am actually really attracted to but jumped on the guy that i'm not attracted to in a second. Why a nice  dinner invitation freaks the hell outta me, while this tacky come-on from this person doesnt? Where is that fear when im there, one leg out, humping, with this...tarzan. Cute tarzan. *sigh   So i said to "D" that we'll see. i'll call him.  Im thinkin that tho this night is pretty appalling and humiliating, and quite degrading, he could be the one to fix my 2 yrs lacking of sex state. Then i said goodnite. And to my surprised he insisted me to stay... 'at least to talk' he said. I said theres nothing to talk really, except that this party took a helluva surprising turn for me. He said likewise. I smiled. Those i-dont-know-what-to-say smile and want-to-get-out-of-here-fast smile. I fixed my dress, get my purse, and get the hell out of there.   And all the way to my house, the only thing i did, is pushed the thought of G. The crave to hear his voice.  I arrived at my place and sat for like half an hour in my garage. I simply felt nothing. I have images flashing back and forth in my mind. The artist, "D", what just happened, and G. and it always stop at G's. And everytime it stops at G, i feel this overwhelming feeling of security, like i was wrapped up in some warm blanket or something. Like i wont be harmed.    What is this? I have rid of things that reminded me of G.  I have burned all pictures, threw away CDs, and all those paraphernalia shit the symbol of his existance. I am sure that ive been doing okay.  I am happy.  I am movin on.  But...it only takes some dinner invitation from a nice guy, and meaningless sex with a prick, to get me all swamped up again in his power.  So, have i really moved on?    what the fuck is going o
