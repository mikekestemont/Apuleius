    Wow......So magnigficient.....so many bloodsheds....so miserable....so unforgettable....       &nbsp;   Umm....my boss took me into the showroom this morning, showing me the mistake I made in one proforma invoice. In calculating the total amount, there is $900 less. Shame on me...although he didn't blame me....but I felt so shameful.....

Yesterday evening we attended the Vacation Bible School's closing ceremony instead of cell group, as a support to the kids, their parents and the bros & Sis served for the whole week.          Yet, when my car change to Hwy101, we started smelling something burnt. No sooner we founded out it's not from outside than the whole car shaked. It was the first time I pulled over on the freeway, and we're shocked to see that the tire on passenger side was teared off. I didn't imagine how it'd happen to me, and more important, how to change the tire!?

He then helped us to change the tire skillfully and explained everything to us, saying that it happened to him three weeks ago.          When it's almost done, he suggested to follow us for a short distance to make sure the tire is safe. We told him that we're going to the church just right on the corner near the exit. "Oh, SJCAC?", he asked with a little smile. And then he showed us the Tee shirt hid under his jacket, displaying the logo of VBS "LAVA ISLAND". Praise the Lord, he is helping in VBS, he is our brother in Christ, he is a helping hand from our Lord!

The most skill required job is to craft the bridge, which I cannot manage so well. And this year, I have almost had my duty shifted to office. But today, I finally get a chance to get involved in cello crafting. There is a bottom wood for an expensive cello and need someone to shape it, in other words, we need to make it a shallow bowl shape. And I volunteered. Sang totally encouraged me to do it whilst Ding was kind of hesitating, worrying the wood would be ruined. But finally, they approved. Having everyone surrounded me, at the beginning I couldn't even get the tool in the wood, or sometime, too much. People started teasing me. Well, Sang then added that I needed to get the feeling upon the wood. And I tried, and gradually I did it as smooth as they do. It took me two hours until Sang and Ding examined the wood. My wrists and fingers are so s
