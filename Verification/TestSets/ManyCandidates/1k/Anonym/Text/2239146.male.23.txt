knowest not! ( you don't even know ).  Everything is in place - come to me now with an attitude of expectancy."
I believe that the Lord is releasing a new zeal upon His people.  He is recreating the hearts of many, many of which who have usually sat in the back row will be in the front calling out to God.  With this new desire things will begin to become easier for the Church.  If we come together in unity then we are unstoppable, but if we segregate we a weak.  The Church is like a school of fish, together we are one big body, but if we drift from eachother we are left vulnerable to the attacks of the ever-lurking sharks.    It's time for us to stand together and simply love, the Bible says the world will know that we are Christians by our love, because our love is Love.  I can see the day, everything seems so easy.  There is one way, one path, one outcome the problem is finding it.  Through obedience to God everything is a breeze, and this present darkness that we live won't seem so dark anymore.  Changing our focus we need to turn towards God, and away from the death that we escaped from once before.  Jesus said that He only does what He sees the Father doing, He also said that we would do greater things the He(John 14:12), there is a key to all of this: listening, waiting, expectancy/faith and obedience.  God will show us what He wants us to do, and He will always come through Deuteronomy 31:8 says:    "The Lord Himself goes before you and will be with you; He will never leave you nor forsake you.  Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged."  As long as you see God doing something then you know for sure that He will not leave you alone, because it was His idea in the first place and He won't step back on His own ideas, no, instead He will send to you the Holy Spirit who is The Counselor, The Helper, The Promise,and The very Spirit that makes us one; at the request of Jesus, and He will perform miracles through you(John 14:16-18, John 14:26-27).  There is one thing that can stop us, and it's not the devil, who is our accuser, it is ourselves.  It is the fear   we   allow to scare us, it is when   we   turn   our   eyes and ears away from God, and it is when   we   deny the words of our Father.  We are our worst enemy, not the devil, he can't force us into anything it is us that yields to his lies.  NO MORE!!!  It could be so easy for us all we have to do is obey, all we have to do is live like the godly children that we are(1 Peter 1:14-16).         "Sing to Him, sing praises to Him; tell of His wonderful acts.         Glory in His Holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the       Lord rejoice."                          ~1 Chronicles 16:9,10                                                                                ~
