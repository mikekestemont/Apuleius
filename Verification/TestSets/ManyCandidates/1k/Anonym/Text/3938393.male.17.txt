three or four gashes in my left knee and shin.    That's physically me.  Now, how about personality?  Well, I like to think I'm a nice guy, but sometimes I sure don't feel like it.  That's why I'm writing this.  Besides that whole fiasco, I'm generally a great guy.  I'm about as thick as a rock,  like most guys, I'm oblivious.  But I'm sensitive and I actually listen when people talk to me.  I'm passionate about what matters to me, and I'm very understanding about what matters to others.  I'm not greedy or needy.  I like having space sometimes, but others I just need to be with someone.  I am constantly flirting, whether the person be female, or a theatre person.  I'm not gay or bisexual, but I think gays and bis should have their rights, and I'm cheering for the other side, even though I don't play on it, haha!  Anyway.  I am a Buddhist, and I'm very into the philosophy of it.  As such, I'd say I'm more tolerant than most people towards conflicting philosophies or religions.      In a girl, there are a few things I am looking for.  Basically, I'm looking for a soul I can bond with.  I'm in it for a good, solid relationship, one that's comfortable, and casual.  She has to be able to hold a conversation with me.  Looks don't hurt, but it's the personality I'm looking for.  In terms of looks, however, I'm not looking for someone who's anorexically skinny.  I'm a sucker for a pretty face, especially nice eyes.  Personality-wise, I'd like someone who shares some of my views.  An activist, who knows something about the world and cares about it, and isn't afraid to be different.  Someone like me, but not exactly.  I'm definitely not looking for high-maintenance or materialistic.  Someone spiritual and reflective that I can relate to and talk with.      Obviously, I like to have fun.  I like to go for walks in the Linley Valley, particularly Arbutus Bluff, where one can look down on Departure Bay and the surrounding area for kilometers.  I also like to just hang out with friends, you know, usual teenager stuff.  When I'm bored and alone, however, I like to head down and play some video games, preferably with someone else.  Yeah, I'm a gamer, and something of a consumer whore for it and I'm sorry.  I just like video games, what can I say?  Other than that, I listen to alot of music, and talk to friends.  I'm looking for a job, and I'm learning to drive, should have my N by the end of August, hopefully.      So, that's my personal.  If you fit me, and I fit you, and live in the area of Nanaimo BC, why don't you drop me a comment?  I'm not being desperate, I simply psychicly knew this was what you wanted.  Ahem...I guess this is just my way of giving you all a glimpse of me, I'm not really expecting anything out of it, but hey, you never know.  This is the Single Dark Horse, signing o
