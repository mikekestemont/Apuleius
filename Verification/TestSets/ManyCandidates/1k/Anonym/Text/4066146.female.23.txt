or empty because they will never grace the pages of some glossy magazine, but for some stupid f-ed up reason I have created an entirely different set of standards for myself. Oddly enough, I don't even have a very critical gaze when it comes to other people. I hate going out with my sister because she is constantly finding flaws with mere strangers: "Look at her outfit. Oh my god. He butt looks HUGE!" - I never do that. In fact it takes a lot for me to even notice another person's appearance. They have to be either disfigured of incredibly freakish for me to take a second look, yet I put myself under the imperfection microscope almost every day. I guess I'm getting "better" about it - no, I know I am, but still have a loooong way to go. I guess you could say today was one of the bad days. I went shopping real quick after the dentist and of course whenever I go shopping I get depressed: too many mirrors. The funny thing is I have never felt relief from this: even when I weighed 97 pounds (sad but true) my junior year, had heart problems, couldn't walk up the hill without wanting to pass out, my boss threatened to report me to the infirmary and Lauren told me I "looked like Skeletor - and that's a BAD thing!", I still woke up every day and tried on 5 different pairs of jeans until I found one that didn't "make me look fat" and got frustrated when a certain style of shirt I wanted to buy didn't fit in the size XS and I was forced to buy a size S. In reality, I now know I could've tried on 5000 jeans and it wouldn't have mattered - my life wouldn't have been any different if I was a size 2 or a size 22; I was deeply miserable and lonely regardless of what size jeans I wore (after years of therapy I finally figured out my anorexia on my own. I think it was easier not to figure it out before) It doesn't matter now either - now that I really could stand to lose 10 pounds - whether a certain pair of jeans does or doesn't make me look a certain way. I'll still have to go to work, I'll still be in love with and loved by Pete, my family will still be bizarre, ultimately frustrating, but endearing just the same, and I'll still be clueless and scared to death of the upcoming school year, let alone life after school. I may not be miserable or lonely anymore, but I still habitually find flaws with myself. I KNOW these things now, but I haven't quite gotten to the point of BELIEVING them. Maybe I just need some more time. Hell, it took me 11 years to even get to this point.  Anyway, I'm going to go have some food, chill out for a bit, and then hit the elliptical. It's too daaarrrn hot. -
