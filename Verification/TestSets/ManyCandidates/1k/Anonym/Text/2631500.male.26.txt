anything. Silly excuse!) with lot of users ready to help you at any time. Their support is also excellent. No complaints.   urlLink Gmail , launched in April 2004, seems to be an instant hit with the beta testers. Who will say no to 1GB online storage ?? But is it that good? I didn't like the screen shots posted on their website. It seems to be lacking most of the useful features Fastmail has. It doesn't have IMAP !! And it seems to be relying a lot on Javascript. Anyway, I'll get an account once the testing phase is over and accounts are open to public.
After one week of rain, the sky is clear, the sun is out and the temperature is too high. Sleeping in the night has become difficult. But, I'm waking up early nowadays. I now sleep naked.
Burgundy colour. Two weeks old. Wore five times. Missing since 8th Saturday morning. Well, it's my shoe.  I've been travelling in the same train atleast 2 times a month, for the last 4 years. But, never lost a thing. When I woke up on Saturday morning in the train, my shoe was missing. I had to leap bare-footed from the train to the car.  Maybe, the guy who took it needed it more than I do. Hope he makes good use of it.  The first thing I did on Saturday was to shop for a new shoe. I went to the shop wearing a slipper, a dirty jeans - all my clothes jumped into the washing machine, and an old shirt. The shopkeeper would've thought that I'm some begger. Whichever shoe I take, he'll say that it's costly. Finally, when I flashed my credit card, he started calling me 'Sir'. What a change! People respect only the dress.  It didn't rain in Chennai today. Felt like a furnace when I stepped out for lunch. Finished the lunch and came back quickly to the comfort of the office.  Hmm.. I might go to US for an 8 week by the end of this month. Let's see...
The siege of Fallujah seems to have ended once the Iraqi general took charge. Probably, this general was leading the so called insurgents. Anyway, it's good that the number of deaths has decreased.  Who knows, the US might just bring back Saddham to suppress the militia in Sadr city!
It's raining in Chennai!   It started raining yesterday evening. The weather is supposed to be hot and humid now, with temperature reaching around 45 degree celcius (We don't care about Fahrenheit in this part of the world). People here call this period as   Agninakshatram   - meaning Fire start. During this period, the temperature will reach its peak. Last year the maximum was 45. This year, it's supposed to cross that.  But this rain came as a surprise. Outside it's cool. It's good time to sleep.
