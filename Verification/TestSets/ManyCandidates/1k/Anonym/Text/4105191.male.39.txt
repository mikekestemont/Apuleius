the first place. Then, from the direction in front of my stand, I definitely heard a deer coming...fast. I spun back around (to face the front again) and got my shotgun up and ready (a Remington 870 with a rifled replacement barrel-shoots a 1 oz. sabot-sweet weapon for deer!). The deer was getting closer and coming fast but I could not see it yet. Then, from behind me again I definitely heard a step in the leaves. So now, after 8 hard days of hunting and seeing very few deer, I knew I had one in front and one behind me at the same exact time (isn't that the way it always is?). I had to make a decision-face front or rear? My heart was hammering and I think I forgot to breathe for a while. I decided to wait for the fast-approaching deer in front of me. I waited. I could hear the deer behind me start to walk away. Come on deer! Get here already! Finally, I got a good glimpse of the deer in front of me. It was a doe. I quickly spun around and looked through the fork of the tree to try to get a look at the deer behind me--already sure I had missed my opportunity. But I was amazed to see a nice, perfectly shaped rack heading away from me at a trot about 40 - 50 yards out. He was maybe three steps from being gone. I had maybe two seconds to get a shot, so I threw my shotgun into the fork of the tree, aimed for the shoulder-blade area and pulled the trigger, praying that I didn't screw it up. He went down in tracks about 60 yards out--like a piano got dropped on him. I was so excited I almost fell out the stand trying to get down the ladder. Of course, then the  real  work began...

This is a test blog from my blackberry. I'll be using it to post live experiences from my boat, deer stands, etc. Crit

Hello, I'm Crit. Welcome to my blog. My blog will mostly be dedicated to the subjects of hunting, fishing and the outdoors--why I enjoy it, why I think its important, and how my various trips into the woods and waters go. I decided to blog on these subjects for a couple of reasons: 1) I enjoy it; and 2) I am acutely aware that a fair number of folks--mostly people who know nothing about hunting or fishing--are against it and would like to see my right to enjoy it revoked. Maybe I can learn something from you, maybe you can learn something from me. I look forward to it either way.    PS. Bear with me as I learn how to post pics and use blogger. Hopefully, there is a pic of me with a nice brown trout I caught recently on the Little Red River near my home in Arkansas  u
