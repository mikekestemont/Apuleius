the concept sounds about right.  It's all about pushing for a balance between work and life, which is grossly out of whack for most Americans.  I've always been aware of the fact that the US is one of the most production obsessed countries, but until I read the site I had never known about that fact that  urlLink the United States is about the worst when it comes to vacation and work laws .  (In comparison to most of Europe, Australia, and even China and Japan).  Although more vacation really sounds nice, the thing that I'm for is more enjoyable work environments.  I don't think the fact that people have to work is what ruins them - in fact  urlLink the  right  kind of work makes people feel good  - but moreso the fact that they work in little tiny cubicles, stressed out, bosses breathing down their necks, and always seem to have more work than they can handle.  I'm wondering if it's worth my time to pursue.  Maybe if I get a fun new job I won't care so much about the balance crap, because maybe I'll enjoy work.
I wonder what it is that makes people so different when it comes to settling for things in life.  Most of the people I work with seem to have just settled for what they've got.  When it comes to changing something, they simply say, "I can't."  But with me, every day that goes by I feel like there's got to be more out there.  Something.   But sometimes I wonder, am I so different?  I work at the same place they do.  I do the same complaining they do.  I do the same wishing for more free time.  All the people at work seem to cling to their jobs as if the world would end without them.  They take heaps of shit from their superiors, and are put into situations that would make me get up and walk away.  I'm lucky that my duties pretty much just call for me to sit and work at the computer, because if I had to deal with account managers, customers, or anyone else on any sort of regular basis, I wouldn't have lasted as long as I have.  And these people complain  all  the time, and I say to them flat out either "Why don't you get another job then?" or "I couldn't put up with what you put up with.  You pretty much get screwed."  I don't hide my feelings.  I'm just lucky I've never been put in a situation like that where I would be forced to make  the  decision.   But I suppose the same questions could be put on me.  Does the fact that I am looking for a new job make it better?  Does the fact that I'm learning Italian so I can move to Italy in two years mean anything?  Does it count that I am working towards my goals and want to  live  and wring more from my life make it ok now?  I like to believe that it d
