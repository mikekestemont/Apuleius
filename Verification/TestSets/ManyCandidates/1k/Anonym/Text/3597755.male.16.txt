the best present I could imagine for her.' And, since the site is pro Bush the answer was: 'o, yes ofcourse. We'll be glad to lie for you. That's what we do best anyway, acting stupid and twisting the truth.'  Ok, this might be just an accident. But then I read the fourth mail: question: "Does Barney ever eat dessert? " answer: "No (...)The President and First Lady have requested that we do not feed Barney because we want to keep Barney slim and trim like everyone else in the residence." my conclusion: First of all, who the fuck is Barney. Here in Holland we have a darts player whose nickname is Barney but he's fat. Can't be him. Anyway. No matter who or what Barney is, the question is completely useless. Therefore it got an answer. If you read this, and you think you're weighing a bit too much, and you were planning on voting for Bush, guess again. Everybody has to look slim and trim if it is up to the president. Quite ironic if you know that America is the country with the most fat people in the world...  A third mail: Question: "Why is the United States not doing anything in Sudan? To see so many people being killed and us not doing anything about it, really disturbes me." Answer: "Powell (...) made clear that the U.S. will press for a strong United Nations Security Council resolution. We are, and will continue to very closely monitor the situation on the ground. " My conclusion: The guy who asked the question is somebody who was brainwashed before the Iraq war. Go see Fahrenheit 9-11 if you don't know what I mean. The answer was more striking though. It's a similar situation but here the UN is important while in Iraq the US didn't give a fuck. Does it matter that in Iraq there was a dictator and here people are just killing eachother? No, people die, and that was the main argument of the US to attack Iraq. The WMD can't be called a real erason since they were being tracked down and after the war appeared to be non-existing. What the real difference is though is that Iraq has more oil than Sudan and that it was easier to get the American people against Saddam than against an internal war. If they'd send soldiers the American people might get mad because they have nothing to search for in Sudan. I mean, no dictator, no WMD, no oil. Why should they bother?  I think it's clear why this site is ridiculous. Especially when you watch the answer to the first question which is on today (which was also the first question handled by me in this post) and the answer to the question of Donna from Baton Rouge, Louisiana. I know there are a lot of stupid Americans, so these question might actually be real, but why do I get the feeling this is all fake...  I want to break free from your lies You're so self s
