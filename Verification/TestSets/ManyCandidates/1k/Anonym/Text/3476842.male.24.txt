the thought prevalant at the dark ages of europe. If it is still popular.... we have reached nowwhere in terms of civilization.  I do think and hope saddam is gone by the end of the war but, I also thought and hoped that bin laden would be gone, sometime back. ugh..  war is not what we see on tv and say  tch.. And it is definitely not something to be supported because it has begun. i think you will agree that all of us have only one life, and every one is entitled to think that it is meaningful.  hey btw, i can assure you something, the end of the world is not near.... atleast as long as we protest and keep the ray of hope shining for the millions who are and will be affected by war.
Mood: Pensive  .We do what we do, to do something for us. .Even those that we do for others, is for the intrinsic satisfaction that we get by the "feel-good" factor that comes with it. .Accepting the above is not a pessimistic attitude. .Once we accept that fact we all fall under a common denominator. .How much physical gain you want and how much spiritual/mental gain you want, are the main constituents of one's character. .What one wants is so unique and varied that all of us are unique. .Money has become a universally accepted "credit card"(!), that most of our wants are determined by it and we aspire mostly not in terms of our wants but in terms of money. .This misleads us into thinking that when we have more money our wants are satisfied. .This explains the classic "what have i done all my life earning this money?" syndrome, because at the end of the day we realise that somewhere down the line we forgot our wants in the search for the means to satisfy our wants. .We need to keep reminding ourselves where we are going 'cause we tend to forget in our hurry where we are going. .Since the destination is our choice, we can stop anywhere and retire. .But if our destination is fixed strongly and we stop in the middle our journey seems incomplete. .Most people let others choose the destination for them. .Individuality is the highest form of religion if one realises it truly. .Life is cruel - because it is a sexually transmitted disease.
"I have forgotten this before"  It happens to us all at one time or another: deja vu, that uncanny feeling of having experienced something before but being unable to recall exactly when or where. The term comes from the French for "already seen," and is defined by psychiatrists as "any subjectively inappropriate impression of familiarity of a present experience with an undefined past." But that clinical description hardly does justice to the eerie sense of mystery and unease we feel during such an episode of inexplicable recognition. ~ The Times ~
