stupid again going to sleep at 3:00! I am sitting here eating coacoa pebbles on this hot summer day, 88 degrees (thank you weatherbug) and writing in this because I am extremely bored. Today I am an only child, because my sister AND brother are both at my cousins house, it feels good to be an only child. The only other person at the house today is my mom, and Ozzy. Ozzy is my little brother, he is a 2-year-old Jack Russell mix, and he loves toys, like his thing head, taxi, reno dolls, and duck. He is short, has brown, white, and black hair, a docked tail, sticky-uppy ears, and a yellow collar and DAMN is he cute. Other words, I am waiting for a call from my best friend, Olivia, about going to see a movie, but she hasn't called. I am really lazy, so I won't call either. I bet she is just like me, and is being a lazy bum. Oh well. The music I'm listening to right now is  Boogie Nights  ,  by Earth, Wind, and Fire. It's an old song from the 70's, but it's really good.  Dance with the boogie get down, cause boogie nights are allllwaaays the best in town!    It has nothing to do with my mood right now, but it still makes me wanna get up and boogie. I'm reading this book, called "Lucy's Launderette". It sucks horribly, but I'm still going to read it, because I've given up on about 6 books this summer, so I feel stupid. Anyway, I think I'm going to go now and call Olivia. Someone has to call! Shee Yah Lata.      -Sierra
Dear Journal,            Today was a pretty regular day for me, I woke up around 12:00, because I've been been staying up too late lately, like I am now... hehe. Anyway, I ate breakfast, what consisted of  milk , and  lucky charms . Delicious. Then I just wasted my poor 13-year-old life, watching TV. Later I hung out with my cousin who was over, which was fun until my "little" sister, Hannah Banana came and stole my cousin away from me. I was sad, so I took a shower, because it was a 95 degree day. The shower was amazingly refreshing. I came out, and tied my hair in a bun so it would hopefully be curly in the morning, which always looks good. Then I wasted my day some more, and went on the computer for a few hours. When I got bored, I decided to take advantage of the weather and go tanning. It didn't work because I was lieing down on my front side, and when I thought that side was fully baked, I turned around and the sun was beating death rays into my eyes, so now I have one nice tan side, and one "pale" side. But don't worry, I won't get skin cancer, because I put on sunscreen! Bleck, it smells bad. Anyway, I have to go now, I think it might just be my bed time! Goodnight.       -
