liberal strongholds such as NYC and how Dems support regressive "sin" taxes on cigarettes) for over-inflated "health/safety concerns".  A similar thing happened this past year at the University of Pennsylvania. Its more liberal/Democratic student government, banned smoking in dorms on campus.  Conservatives, more so than liberals, support smokers' rights. Business interests (largely Republican) want to be able to cater to customer preferences and the tobacco industry (which supports Republicans), doesn't want to be unfairly targeted at the expense of basic individual freedom and personal liberty, which is really what this issue is all about.  From a state-run liquor control board in PA, which is dominated by Democratic labor unions and which causes the prices of liquor to be much higher and less available than in neighboring states, to dance clubs that have had to be shut down because of reckless lawsuits from more likely-to-be Democratic trial lawyers, to fireworks (think fourth of July) which are much more regulated, if not banned, in liberal northeastern states, than they are southern ones, such as Alabama and South Carolina, to liberal attacks against university Greek life as being discriminatory, misogynist, and non-inclusive; on more than just these issues, the conservative view is the more party-friendly position.  This is somewhat ironic, because liberals are generally stereotyped as being bigger partiers/more fun-loving than "up-tight" conservatives. Though liberals may be bigger partiers on the whole, I would seriously contest on a whole range of issues that conservative policies are more party friendly.  Younger, party-concerned voters (not just the political ones) should realize that the Republican Party is the best party in town.  urlLink
urlLink Interesting article  in the Christian Science Monitor about the gender gap experienced by many American colleges and universities.    "It's wrong to put your thumb on the scale for a male applicant when you've got a better-qualified female, but I know the colleges are doing it because they've told me," says Thomas Mortenson, a policy analyst at the Center for the Study of Opportunity and Higher Education in Washington.  A Midwestern college president who asked not to be named agreed, saying that some colleges he knows well admit men at higher rates even though "women are usually the stronger candidates." ....  "We could possibly enroll an entire class of women - our pool of women applicants is that strong," he says. "We could not enroll a whole class of men, because we don't have enough strong male candidates."    Admissions offices are struggling for balance, and many resort to raising acceptance rates for male candidates in order to reduce the gender gap. I'm interested to see how this affects affirmative action supporters' arguments that AA is necessary for diversity's sake. Clearly, few supporters of AA will rush to ensure that more men are placed in top colleges. Maybe this will reveal the diversity question as the distraction it is, and force the debate to focus on the real question: whether AA is a good means to address past or present systemic discrimination.  By the way, this is a very serious problem at  urlLink my school .
