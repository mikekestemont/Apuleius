the pitfalls of such unorthodox modes of travel. I walk to work. I live about a mile and a half from my office in downtown Minneapolis. My commute takes around 25 minutes from door to desk. On very hot and humid days I may arrive with a trickle of sweat running down my back or on my forehead. So what. It isn't enough to make me smell up the office and its usually gone within 30 minutes in my climate-controlled building. On very cold days I arrive ready to wrap my hands around a hot cup of oatmeal (fuel for the commute home). If I lived farther away and wanted to still arrive in 25 minutes or less, I would have to run or ride a bike (or skateboard or wear roller blades, etc.). This would increase my chances of arriving in an unacceptably sweaty mess, unready for work until I showered and changed clothing (adding to the commute time). Engineers please take note. Here is a problem which you should be able to solve. Can you make a self-propelled vehicle which will require the same exertion as walking, but travel twice as fast? Or, if you like, create a fabric that disposes of the sweat in an in-offensive way. Of course you could, if you weren't so busy trying to build a better bomber for the Air Force, or create the perfect niche for a cupholder in that mini-van. Of course, you say, nobody would buy such things. I would. And others will to if you make them so that they can be sold at a profit. Trust that there are marketers out there every bit as good at what they do as you are at what you do. (Marketers, I'll spare you my ire today, but be consider notice has been served.) Sure, this is a rant. But it's a rant with purpose. You always hear people challenging you to think outside the box. Here's a little explored area way outside the box. Not even the Wright brothers believed that the airplane would be commercially viable. Think of the benefits to the environment, to public health, to the economy. Have some faith in what a body can do.&nbsp;
I made this graphic after getting sick of hearing about John Kerry, the war hero.&nbsp; I'm no fan of George W. Bush, but it's too bad the Democrats couldn't come up with anyone better than this aging fraud for a nominee.  urlLink Click here if you want this on a t-shirt, mug or button.
I'm interested in putting together a list of physical challenges which have yet to be done.   Here is the criteria:  1.  Can't be exorbitantly expensive.  (Let's set  a starting point, but keep an open mind.  Certainly won't consider multi-million dollar space flights.) 2.  Can't be a matter of quantity alone. (eg. Nobody's won the Tour de France 7 times.) 3.  Can't be something that's so obscure that nobody will care.  (eg. Nobody has ever jumped across Big Beef Creek wearing nothing but pantyhose.) 4.  Can't be illegal.  Any i
