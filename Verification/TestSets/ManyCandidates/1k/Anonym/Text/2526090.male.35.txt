gets behind the facade of what we so often read in cliche-laden business books of today.
Remember Tab soda? I can remember how huge this was in the late 70's. The whole saccharine scare kind of killed Tab, but Coca Cola still makes it and it's available in limited quantities throughout the US. I think I'm going to grab one next time I go to the store.
I don't think it matters if you have a grade school education or a doctorate; this book can help anyone! I have read Good To Great by  urlLink Jim Collins  (parts of it many times) and it is THE book I recommend to anyone who seeks to improve themselves and/or their work environment and productivity.  In my observations, I've noticed that there is one major diffeence between people who are great and those who are good. Great people don't settle for good; they are never satisfied with riding the train given to them by life - they build their own train, their own tracks, and fill the compartments with people who challenge them to much higher heights of excellence than they currently know. As my dad told me so often as I was growing up, "Spend your time with people who are better than you." He meant that I should be around people who would challenge me to new levels - levels I didn't know existed. That was some of the best advice I'd ever received. I now make it a point to challenge myself in how and where I spend my time, because what we are exposed to today shapes who we will become tomorrow. I can't imagine going through life with an ordinary, "get by" way of thinking. I am working on going from Good To Great each day. Pave your own path! Get this book and let it make you better!

This post is just about some of the daily gadgets I depend on. It's amazing that just a few years ago, I did fine without any of these.
I have been really bad about blogging lately. I think most of my readers have abandoned my website. Can you blame them?  ;-) I've been so busy with school and life, but I will try to post at least weekly from now on.  Have you had an  urlLink afternoon delight  lately?  urlLink Check this out  and click on "Afternoon Delight" under "videos." Hilarious!

(Above: Fernando toward the end of his amazing career)  When I was a young kid, I got caught up in  urlLink Fernandomania  and soon became a life-long fan of Fernando Valenzeula, the greatest pitcher Mexico has ever produced. Fernando is now a bit more accessible because he does the Spanish language radio broadcasts for the Los Angeles Dodgers. One weekend I am going to LA to meet the man I listened to on the radio as a little kid and still admire.  Hasta l
