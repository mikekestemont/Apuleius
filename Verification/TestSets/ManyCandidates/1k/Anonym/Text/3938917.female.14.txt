the shovel that dug me deeper can go back in the shed with the rest of the tools.  I'd like to go out with a line, give you a wink, a sneer, but I can't even breathe and you don't play with your food. You pull the trigger; a deafening pop and the silence of darkness.  From the silent depths of darkness, it comes back crushingly heavy and without warning; an ocean of conciousness drops on you and the sound is deafening. Black subsides to white and slowly you come to a hazy light in this room of your own design. Disoriented at best; the sweat, the blood, the fear and pain all fighting to register at the same time in your cranium. Your chest rattles as you try to breathe from the periodic bouts of crying and pain, the little you remember.  The crulest tricks are the happy endings your mind tries to write from the failures you have created. All you can do is wait to wake up. One thing stands out in this vertiginous shift in reality: The cold, round shape firmly pressed against your head. Your entire life balanced between your temple and the hammer of my .45. Cutting through the static in your ear drums, my parting love in a shouted whisper:  "Just remember baby, I'm fatally yours..."
I've not blogged for a while because I've been at my dad's house all weekend, but I'm here now.  Ok, in the time thats passed...hmm...Thursday I ended up getting to see Tyler anyways because the fair got boring and so we went to Caleb's house and voila...there he is.  Then the rest of my weekend has sucked.  I'm just a pathetic little girl that misses my beautiful boy; I haven't even talked to him since Thursday night.  Oh man, how am I ever going to make it the next 10 days without him?  I have no clue...well leaving that subject this is what went down this weekend: Friday: After Damian got off work, we went to see The Village.  It sucked terribly and was nothing close to what I had in mind it would be like.  After that, we went back to my dads house and chilled by ourselves because Dad was out playing cards and Vicki was in the hospital with her mom. Saturday: Damian and I went to El Rancherito with Dad and Vicki and Holly and the kids and then left and chilled at various sites until 11.  Got back to dads house and got online until about 1 because he was yelling for me to get offline, so I did and went to bed. Sunday: Woke up at about 1:30 and did nothing all day.  At around 5:30 Damian and I came back to moms house where I currently reside...waiting... and that was my weekend...I know, I know, I need a life.  Oh well, I'm now going to go and wait...and wait a little more in hopes that I get to talk to Ty...dang I bring him up to much.  It's kinda creepy isn't i
