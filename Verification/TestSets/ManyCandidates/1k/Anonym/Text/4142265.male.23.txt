Hello, I'm Hans.  Neat name huh? I like it.  Anyway, here I go, oh wait, I've stopped, hang on a sec......ok, now that my joint's rolled and burning, I'm ready.  Well, first things first, I'm a juggler and have been juggling for about four and a half years now.  I think everyone should learn to juggle, and yes I AM just saying that because I'm a juggler.  Anyway, I taught myself after high school in '99 and have been juggling since.  I'm starting to perform at certain events now so I guess I might consider (or at least I'd like to) myselft to be moving into the professional realm, albeit at a pretty slow pace.  Nonetheless, it is first and foremost a hobby that I really enjoy, and that brings me to the conclusion of my juggling prattle.  So, reader, what brings you here?  Sorry, just a question that I wanted to pose, however, did I mean 'what brings you to this blog' or 'what brings you to this world'?  I'll let you decide.  Well, that's my first little spiel. I might get motivated to spiel again tonight with enough beer (pun intended LOL, hey, it's my blog, I'll say what's funny and what's not :-D )
