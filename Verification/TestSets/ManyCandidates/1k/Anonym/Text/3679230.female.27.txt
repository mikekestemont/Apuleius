that kid made me&nbsp;see that he's&nbsp;going to be loved to bits.  Meeting up with them made me realize (for the thousandth time) that I want to have children, but that's about where the thought process stops, the rest of my life is pretty un-sorted.&nbsp; I want to have a child with an unknown donor as well for two reasons: less legal headaches since the donor couldn't change his mind and demand 'his' child 'back' or demand different conditions in relation to the child&nbsp;than those inititally agreed on, and it would be my and my gf's child, no one else would be involved. Having a child with a male couple is not an option for me.&nbsp; Not at all.&nbsp; I understand why people do it -- it gives the child a mom and a dad and that's what they 'need' and it makes straight people accept it more readily.&nbsp; But it wouldn't be my gf's and my child, it would be some guy's and my child, with his and mine partner as supportive step parents, and that's not what I want.&nbsp; I want a family with my gf, not with some guy.  I guess a known donor would be the ultimate option.&nbsp; I have read enough about test tube babies and adopted children to&nbsp;understand that a person's biological background is&nbsp;important, it's something your child is likely to want to know about to understand who she is.&nbsp; I think this biological hang-up&nbsp;is a socially created 'need' -- there are cultures where biological parents aren't important and where&nbsp;biology isn't seen as creating&nbsp;your identity.&nbsp; But I live in a culture where biology  is  important, in which people search for their biological parents to understand themselves, and I have to assume that my children might feel this need as well.&nbsp; I don't think it's a 'right' to know your biological parents but I feel that taking the&nbsp;option to know&nbsp;away from your children might create problems for them.&nbsp; And I don't want to do that.  At the same time, having children is a selfish act.&nbsp; I'm selfish enough to want to have them in the first place, so why wouldn't I be selfish enough to create the family I want to have, namely me, my gf, and our kids?&nbsp; Without anyone else involved.&nbsp; It would be more difficult, more trying to involve a known donor.&nbsp; The amount of trust you need to place in that person.&nbsp; Where do you find someone you  know  wouldn't demand access 'his' child in a way you wouldn't be prepared to accept?&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone who also would need to play the part of an 'important person' in your child's life -- not the role of a father, but someone your child knows and respects.&nbsp; I don't know a single male person I would place that much trust in.&nbsp;
I found this  urlLink young gay guy's blog  and he had found a good quote in response to someone talking about not 'believing' in homosexuality: 'What do you mean, you "don't believe in homosexuality?" It's not like the Easter Bunny, your belief isn't necessary.'&nbsp; I love t
