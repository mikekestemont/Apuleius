viewer even further into the madness of the movie. Humane directors rarely do cruel better.  But I won't write a full review here (in short: at parts illogical and a little soft, but the suspense is ratched high and the actors turn their guts out, even normally in-control star Denzel). Rather, here I'll focus on its setting, a world both almost audaciously far from ours and yet alarmingly plausible in the near future.  With terrorist attacks so common they're reported with Brokaw matter-of-factness, the movie's US is consumed with the war on terror. The armed forces are stretched thin by fire-jumping from one regional conflict to another. And multinational corporations like the eponymous entity of the movie are the real power brokers. They're so ensconced in the milindustrial complex they write themselves no-bid contracts. They raise mercenary armies to fight where the US cannot. As John Voigt's character, weary liberal senator Tom Jordan says, on their boards sit former presidents, kings and sheiks, trust-fund terrorists. It's Chomsky's world, and Manchurian Global and its ilk play in it.  Obviously, Manchurian is meant as an amalgamation of Halliburton, Carlyle, DynaCorp and other mainstays of the milindustrial complex, and as schizo and paranoid as the movie seems, its setting is possible. The movie's villain isn't simply Meryl Streep's Eleanor Prentiss Shaw--Mother Bates and Richard II in HRC's shell--but rather what breeds and fuels her kind of politician today. And here the movie burrows slightly deeper. Shaw isn't motivated simply by money. Rather, and audaciously close to my suspicions about certain figures in government today, it is a combination of power and ideology, of ill- and good-intentions, to which Manchurian happily adds its vast resources for its own money-making ends. So the NYTime's  urlLink AO Scott is only half-right  when he suggests the villainry stems from something overreaching and banal. It is both, and yet it shows an intersection of righteousness, entitlement and greed, an indignant (if sometimes incoherent) blast against the mix of ideology and profit that undeniably permeates government today.  Esquire's sometime money scribe Ken Kurson said a couple of years ago that corporations function best when they relentlessly pursue their goal, ruthlessly efficient and single-minded, and that the chips will fall eventually into a favourable pattern. Theoretically, that sounds plausible, if inhuman. But as the movie shows, that's rarely the case once the human factor is added. And there comes trouble, when the multitude of motivations both high and base factor in,  and what spews out is a myriad of ill-begotten and sometimes disastrous policies. Not that all government policy stems from this; I'm not that cynical (or libertarian), or that all the policies of even this administration arise from this noxious stew or are always uniformly bad. But the potential, the movie insists, is always there.  There's little necessarily new about this message, certainly. And this movie won't go down as a prescient classic on the order of the original. But set against an extrapolated depiction of our current struggle, it's more than a little bracing. It's both frightening and d
