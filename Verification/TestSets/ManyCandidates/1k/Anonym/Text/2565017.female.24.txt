Although I have sooo many plans, I'm going to relax as well, as much as I can from work! This is going to be one good holiday... *sighs with anticipation* :)
Uh, Summer is almost half way experienced. I've done some things I planned, and some things were left undone.... plans change, and I love it.  June: Hmm, well, first of all, I haven't been able to spend one single weekend at summer cottage. There's always something... sheesh. I will though, this summer, even if it wasn't June. June's been rainy anyway, so who cares, lol.   My niece is visiting right now, and hopefully she's going to stay a few more days. I totally adore her :) I haven't had one single barbeque party either... I blame it on the rain :P But honestly, I've been too busy. I have spent time with friends though.... a little....

I haven't come up with anything else significant, and the amusement park trip is going to be postponed to August 9th. It's the ONLY (can't you believe this) day that Anne and I had a mutual day off from our summer jobs. Well, actually, on August 9th, I won't be working at all anymore, but she, luckily, has a day off.  August: I'm not a fortune teller, so I can't know if my plans for August will happen or not... I'll tell you guys when we're coming closer to September.  The weather is wonderful right now, I should be out, and not typing at my computer inside.... so I'll go and enjoy myself.  Hmm, I'm having some disagreement with my impossible big brother (my niece's dad) and he didn't say hello to me when we briefly saw each other just now... Talk about acting like a 3 year old. He's 31. Bleah, I'm not going to be bothered. I'm going to have a nice d
