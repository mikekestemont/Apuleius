saying, "As lawmakers, we must assure the people of America that our nation will not experience the nightmare of the 2000 presidential election."    The article goes on to say:   The bipartisan  [and by bipartisan they mean moderates and liberals]  commission, they stressed, determined "that the 'disenfranchisement of Florida's voters fell most harshly on the shoulders of black voters' and in poor counties." Both groups vote predominantly Democratic in US elections.   That's right, white men went out and made the voting process so very hard for minority and poor voters.    I can see it now; old white men, a little paunchy but very well dressed, sitting in a well appointed drawing room, leather bound volumes line the walls.  Clounds of Cuban cigar smoke waft gently and brandy is poured into crystal snifters.  They plan and plot against the poor and minority voters in Florida.  Bush is in the center of this group, on the phone with the Saudis making sure they approve.  This is the same crowd, says Ted "The Swimmer" Kennedy, that planned the war in Iraq and knew in advance that Osama and his killers were going to fly planes into the WTC.    Get real people.  We can not let this pass.  We MUST stand up and say that the UN has no authority over America and they are not welcome to "Observe" the elections.  I wonder, who will stand against this??
There are few things in this world sadder than the pictures of Saddam Hussein that were all over the  urlLink news  today.  So thin, so grey and so very insane.  He really and truly believes he did nothing wrong.  Even now he is spewing the kind same garbage that he was spewing before the invasion.  The following quote from Saddam sounds like something our pals Michael Moore, Jeanene Garofalo, Al Franken, the big three media outlets, Katie Couric, and John Kerry would say.   "You know that this is all a theater by Bush, the criminal, to help him with his campaign."   It is sad when American citizens say the same rhetoric as the man who killed thousands of his own people just for grins.  How can anyone dispute that the war in Iraq was just and right?  How can anyone look at the pictures of mass graves, rape rooms, starving children, and then see how well Saddam and his family lived and DOUBT for a SECOND that what we did was just?  This quote sums it all up nicely.   "He (Saddam) should be placed in metal cage and taken on tour of all the Iraqi cities so that the millions who have been starved, robbed, beaten, deprived and tortured by his regime can see the man responsible for their suffering," said Asaad Aziz, an engineer in the mostly Shiite city of Basra.    I could not have said it better myself!
If there was any doubt that Michael Moore was un-American, this  urlLink story  out of China should remove all doubt.  I can't wait to see the film  Michael Moore Hates America  at  urlLink AFR film fest  in Dallas in S
