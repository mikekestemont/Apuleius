know but me! What exactly did they think my reaction would be? And you know the really shitty part? If he had just told me I would have been happy for him. but after "well she's not ready" now I am just annoyed. Like you think you know me so well that you know how I would react, and after "3 years" why does she even care what I think. And I could totally put this down to him being stupid and exactly like him if it weren't for the fact that... well he seems to have a reason for not telling me.             And with all the time I spend at HCT I guess I kindof feel like I'm not a part of life at home. And I come to Michigan and Rachel and Christian are so happy to have me here and it's crazy because I feel at home here. I feel like they actually know me instead of just this person I used to be. I don't know how to explain this feeling but I somehow feel that people don't want to believe that anything bad has happened to me. They don't what to deal with the fact that I have a pretty scary past if you look below the surface. And maybe thats my fault for not telling them. If you just look at me you probably see barely anything bad at all. But it's not true and I'm not the same little kid anymore. and maybe they don't really know me either. Probably Andrew knows me best of anyone because I tell him most of the truth. And Marissa, because she knows the other side of me. Probably if you put the two of them together you might get a clear picture. But here I feel like if I had something I needed to tell my MI friends, they wouldn't judge me for it. and I guess some people who have known me a really long time might have a good reason to not realize that I am growing up but, god, Rachel has known me since I was two! she has known me longer than any other non-family member and I don't feel like she's trying to stop me from being me. I wish people could just do that. Know my past and understand why I am what I am. And there are just some scars that won't heal, even when the marks disapear.         So I guess this blog ended somewhere it didn't start! Thats what happens when you type with your train of thought! But anyways, yea I am pissed at people who just don't tell me things. I mean I guess I don't really have a right to know but it is really shitty to go "I have a girlfriend but I won't tell you who she is because she isn't ready for you to know." Hey, princess, if she's ready for the whole world to know just but reading your blog I don't know why you can't tell someone why actually knows y
