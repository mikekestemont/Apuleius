create new ideas because the mortar of religion covers up all our new pathways to new growth. IF you didn't know, the chips in the bricks allow for new things to be added. 2) The mortar no longer works- the bricks become immune to the mortar because of the weather (the passing of time, aka). What if all of a sudden we find religion is not the answer, then we can't change that because we've always depended on it. 3) The mortar cracks up and falls off... We are left completely unsupported: We are left defenseless and confused because we've spent our whole life depending on religion to tell us what is right, and what we should do...  Just some food for the mind.  Phileda
I'm  an irredeemably eejitous, liberal, tight as fuck, seizure-inducingly boring spod!   urlLink See  how compatible you are with me!  Brought to you by Rum and Monkey   Yes, I just took that test. Go take it and then we can both find out how compatible we are with each other!!!!!
Today was really tiring. I got out of bed because I could not sleep. I feel unusual because my antidepressants are making me hairy. I'm so sad. My kitten got run over this afternoon. I found him when I was coming home from school. His head was all squished. I took some photos. I'll miss him. Poor kitty. Last night I had to go and pay Joshua's bail. He's such a jerk. He got arrested for punching the Walmart clerk in the face for refusing to sell him beer. He's only 16! I want to tell the world that I love you all! You're all so special to me! I am updating this journal for the first time in ages, because I've been in prison. Today, I got a digital camera! Yes! But I don't know how to work it. Can you help me? I want to say thanks to the world for absolutely fucking nothing! You all suck. I feel so alone, no one ever reads this journal, or even comments to let me know that I'm not suffering alone. It's cold here, and I want to die, but I cannot figure out how many of you to take with me when I go. I went to the doctor yesterday, and he said I have bipolar disorder, and should stop smoking drugs. You should all do this quiz! It's amazingly accurate. You just put in your name and birthday, and it will tell you what your favourite sexual position is. This is so cool! This is like, a random journal entry generator... BTW, Travis Q thinks I shold make a new MSN sign in name: cityskank24_7... Ahem! How rude! LOL, jk Travis. How cute! That's enough for now. But I'll leave you with this thought - sharing your life with strangers on the internet is the cheapest form of therapy available. Leave a comment and tell me I'm beautiful.
