 But anyways. That should do fer now. Au revoir mes amigos.
WOOHOO for Greece!  Before arriving in Portugal, they had never won a game in a major tournament before. As soon as the tournament started they made a big impression by beating the hosts Portugal in the opening game...then after getting through their group, they beat off defending champs France 1-0, then beat the Czech Republic 1-0 in the semis, before completely outplaying Portugal in the final (a re-match of sorts from the first game of the tournament).  So...GO GREECE GO!!!  Erm...what else happened today. Oh. The street BBQ. What a joke. Jack (apparently) got so bored he went off to stalk Emma Mullen instead. I watched the Wimbledon final (which Federer won in 4 sets, damn good match). Even the table football was boring. And everyone left to watch the football. Oh, and the Estonians won the world wife-carrying contest again. Erm, yay?  Bah. Even this is getting boring. So...I'm gonna go now.
Work was...well...painful. There was the usual crapload of rose bushes to cut my fingers apart on. Then I had to 'help' this old couple by carrying a 70L bag of compost up through the car park and into their car. That did my back in...then it was lunch. Where someone had left an open bag of muffins in the staff area. Bwahahahaha. Free muffins. After lunch, some very annoying person bought over £200 of stuff, then paid for it  all in £10 vouchers . So I had to completely mark up 20 vouchers with the date, my name, my signiture etc, while still serving people. ARRRRGGGHHH. Other than that, it was a great day. And I managed to get a few more muffins at the end of the day, as did Joe. And probably everyone else who works there.  Somehow, that 17 year old Russian girl managed to thrash the living crap out of Serena Williams to win Wimbledon. (6-1, 6-4). Wooot.
Can't...get...damn...Kenya...song...out...of...head...  Thats gonnae have to go on the music page someday soon. Which now has 12 clips. Wooo. Go checkitout. Link is on the right toolbar thing. Big purple button. Can't miss it.  Today was pretty damn good. Only *properly* got up at about 1pm, then went and played tennis with Joe. The tennis combined with riding there 'n' back, for some reason, nearly killed me. I'm completely worn out. And might fall off my chair at any moment.  In Euro 2004 news: The final (to be played on the 4th of July) is going to be between Portugal and Greece. Which is interestingly the same fixture as the opening game. GO GREECE (again). And I just had a good session of beating the living crap out of Warrilow at Nike Ole. Woohoo.  There was some pretty bad news, but I'm not gonna post it here. So if you really wanna hear it talk to me tomorrow. =P  Oh, and: The sites hit counter is going upupUP pretty fast. 74 hits in a day and a few hours of yesterday. And one of 'em was from Taiwan. *
