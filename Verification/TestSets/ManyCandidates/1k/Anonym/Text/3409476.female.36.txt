action (mom are you watching this year?).  Going to Costco and then will post tonight or tomorrow (I have taken the rest of the week off of work to recover from this weekend) with a try at posting pictures.
I don't know how many of you have tried to pump information out of an exhausted 14 year old boy before, but it aint easy.  The team walked off the bus looking like zombies, they had not slept the night before, too much adrenaline I am sure.  On our drive home to his bed, I got a call from a co-worker offering me free Dodger tickets and parking, as I was going to decline because of exhaustion this person ion the back seat woke right up and insisted that we go pick up Melody and go.  Good thing we did because parking was right next to the entrance.  Our seats were irectly behind home plate, and the DOdgers played a great game.  So throughout the night he spit and spouted tiny bits of information about the trip.  I will post those when I am home at a PC and can do so with formatting.
Due to a glitch in my ability to not only remember to set up a VCR but to also explain to someone over the phone how to do it, we missed all 3 shows last night.  SO be fruitful in your comments so we can enjoy through you.

GOLD!   GOLD!   GOLD!   GOLD!   GOLD!   GOLD!   GOLD!   GOLD!   GOLD!   GOLD!   GOLD!   GOLD!   GOLD!   GOLD!   GOLD!   GOLD!      Adam called me a little while ago and let me know they went undefeated and will receive the Gold medal at the closing ceremonies tonight.  I have just landed back on Earth (but have yet to stop crying) so it took me some time to get this post up.  Erika very nicely sent me training on pictures so as soon as I get some they will be up.
http://www.childrens-games.org/results_frame.html?event=baseball_boys.html  You can go to the website and get updates on the games.  We found out last night that the team was supposed to be on Good Morning America today but I have not been able to watch it here at work.    But I have set it up to tape at home.  As soon as Adam calls me I will update everyone.
The boys got to play today and play they did.  They beat the S. Korea team 18 to 0.  ANd also beat the Newar NJ team (I don't know the score.)  So they are at this time the #1 seed.  According to Adam they are guaranteed the Bronze, if they win one game tomorrow they will get Silver and if they win both games tomorrow they get Gold.  So all in all a very good time is being had.  The Rock N ROll Hall of Fame was a bust even the old guy (coach Steve my age) said it wasnt worth the time or admission price of $
