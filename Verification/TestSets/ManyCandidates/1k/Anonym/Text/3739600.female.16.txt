yet and the difficult decisions start. There's this one guy I haven't talked to for a long time, who I saw tonight on my way home from D.E. Well, he pulled over and asked me how I was doing and all. So he got outta the car and showed me his new system that he put in. Well, while he was doing that he asked me if I ever thought about the two of us toegether, then gave me his # and told me to call tonight. He's a good guy and all but at the moment I really don't want anyone. I am ashamed to admit this but my heart is still stuck on the last one I was with  ( kinda sad, huh?)  and I really don't like beingging in a relationship anymore! Like I said he's a good guy but I just don't want to get invovled with anyone anymore. My relationships wont last unlit I get up out of here and get my own place and that wont be for like another year and a half.... This happen like 40 minutes ago, so now I am sitting here thinking about all the crappy shit that has happened in the past.... AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!....It's driving me nuts! maybe I am blowing this whole thing outta proportion.               Goosh I feel like breaking down and crying! I haven't realized just how much sucky ass crap has happened in the last month and a half! Don't get me, it's not the whole situation I just told you about that is tearing me up, it's that I haven't really stopped to grasp what the fudge is going on. Damn it sucks to be going through this!         Nigh night   ~Brandi*~
Well I finally saw Clayton, Mike and everbody else!   urlLink          It was pretty kool. The only down fall was that I ran into Gaby! It really sucked! I think I should just stop talking to her all together. It was fun while our friendship lasted but she has changed dramaticly and truthfully I hate it! I miss the old Gaby. It feels as if she was taken over by someone else! Plus everytime I do talk to her all she talks about is Eric or she starts to mock me. It gets on my nerves when she does that. I have nothing against Eric but damn it gets old hearing about him. I could write a book about him! I hope I wasn't like that with Gary. If I was, I am about to kick myself! Then later on at 6:15 I have Drivers Ed! Ok anyways, that's what happened today and what's going to happen.          urlLink         Hopefully the guys (as in Mike, Clayton and Jesus) can all go to Six Flags   Saturday  ! My mommy said it would be ok, as long as we go  Saturday  and she can met them(with girls as well). If so I know we are going to have fun. Shoot those three together means something intresting is bound to happen!           Well I'm gonna go! Toot-a-lou!               urlLink         Much Lov, Brandi*         u
