point, even a nice weekend gettaway to Egypt for the low price of 399 euro all inclusive with hotel.  As it is, we are sticking this weather out - it's not like we can just quit now and decide to get on the next train to the airport and fly home to sweet sweet America.  But then again...  Well, I think yak ribs are on the menu tonight.  It does't get any better than that.
I have no idea where I am going, nor do I have any clue where I just came from.  All I know at this point is that I am so cold and the air is so thin that I am relying on all my training to survive.  At this point, my mind has taken the backseat and pure survival instinct has taken over.  I do not know when this entry will be entered but if you are reading this, you can assume that I have lived long enough to reach base camp.  All I can think about at this point is to getting to base camp, crawl into my battered down sleeping bag - that is, if our expedition tent hasn't blown away.    Sometimes just thinking about that nice warm place with satalite uplink to enter this blog just gives me the strength to hope for another night up here.  To fill you in, I am writing this at about 21,600 ft.  We have spent the last week trying to return from "village 469" (sorry about the ambiguous name for the sake of these people who risk their lives for what they believe in this "closed" country).  Although it was a relief to make such a large "drop off" of materials and stuff, we had to risk not having enough supplies because of weight and space.  It was worth it to spend this precious time with our high-altitude friends.  I fear for my team, although I know it's all going to be ok - it always works out.  Praise God.  Right now 2 guys have mild frost bite and I don't know how long they can hold out before not being able to continue walking.  We are trying to wait out this little western breeze for hopes that by daybreak the passes will be clear to make the 2 day trip back across the border and to our base camp.    Sometimes the people in these villages believe that these western winds carry leprosy or something... what it is is basically people getting frost bite from the cold.  Some call this place "the roof of the world"... a place where one is closer to the "heavens".  Now I know why people that come through these parts feel this way... probably because they're freezing to death.  Ha.  Hey, at least my Mac has enough battery juice to keep me company.  As I finish writing this, the sound of nice instrumental music balances quite nicely the intimadating winds trying to pick up my tent.  It's a nice feeling to know that you may not wake up, but hey, praise J
