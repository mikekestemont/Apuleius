I tell you how much I like these things...? (very much) * Most of the new Wilco album (except for all of the damn distortion - SO overused by the indie-crowd, dudes! and the song with nothing for 10 minutes. I know, artisitic freedom and all that crap, but hey, why not just make a shorter song?) * The first half of the FiveEight album. Can you beat lyrics like, "The lights are like liquor, cuz they're my favorite pill." ? (no.)
Sorry I've been MIA. Very busy at work.  I had a dream last night that all of my blogging friends (you guys!) were at this summer camp-type thing. And my car wasn't running right and some lady tried to tell me how to do my job and then Justin Timberlake asked me to join him in the middle of the dance circle (much to my fellow bloggers chagrin) and then he started shooting a fake gun and everybody thought he was a looser for waking the neighbors.  I woke up with the realization that my briefcase had been stolen the other day when my car was broken into. WTF, people. Why can't people leave my car (and other belongings) well enough alone? I mean, in the grand scheme of things, I guess I'm lucky: when my car was hit by the drun driver, no one was hurt. When my car was broken into, they didn't take my new stereo, just empty cd cases and my cheap T.J. Maxx briefcase. (althogh there may have been credit card info in there, so I could have my identity stolen! on the other hand, we're talking about someone who stole empty cd cases - it it possible they would not know how to steal "me").  On a much better note: JM has now officially spolied me. I am now a real spolied girl. Last night he "officially" asked me to be his girlfriend by getting down on one knee in Piedmont Park(freaked me out) and presenting me with a diamond necklace and bracelett. These things are, without a doubt, the nicest (read: prettiest and most expensive) gift any guy has ever given me - and that includes my engagement ring and wedding band from what'shisface. I am very much the bling bling, y'all.  And then there's this thing about prayer that I have been wanting to write about. I really want to start praying more often. There was a bunch of introspective thoughts I wanted to share on the subject, but I didn't write them down in my notebook, so I have no idea anymore what they were.  Wow. This is a strange and rather disappointing post for you guys, isn't it? I am leaving first thing tomorrow for my Mom's house. I will be posting from there.  PS: I tried to email my former mother-in-law yesterday about the photos, but apparently she has blocked my email address. She must really be afraid of me. What does she think I am going to do? Spam her to death? This is getting to be a
