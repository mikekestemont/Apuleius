by a horrid Indian family from East London. I shouldn't mention names for legal reasons but the mother had brought her three sons down from London on a two week break which started roughly about the same time ours did. Her eldest son was 19 and about six foot five, he wasn't bad looking but not exactly a hunk. His mother, from the minute I met her, went about trying to set me up with him- making comments about how hes looking to marry a young woman just like me. A University girl. Great, thats all I needed. I was dying to tell her where to go at that point but I bit my tongue and hoped he would get embarassed and later tell her to shut her mouth. Nope, he was looking. My brother took to hanging with him at night and ended up with all kinds of odd people. Funnily enough, this "nice young 'boy'who would be an ideal husband" punched me on the side of the head, thus knocking me to the floor. The ideal husband, of course.   Well, the family started to get too pushy so we backed off and stayed away from them but they bent over backwards to try to get near us. Then the mother was getting noticibly more irritated by our ignoring her. She approached my sister and I as we went to breakfast on Monday morning (about 10am)- she made comments about my sisters clothes (not sure why) and then when I asked her what the problem was she answered " Your all psychopaths, tell your mother to watch her back". I didn't think she meant it literally. While at the phonebox at 11.15am she sprung up on my mother and I (my sister was in the phonebox with mum- I was outside it) while mum was calling Scotrail to book tickets to get a train back up because by that time we'd had enough. She and her eldest lead an attack on my mother and I until security personel were forced to help out. No, they didn't come running, despite my sister being in hysterics. I'd taken a few serious knocks to the head and had been pinned by my inner left thigh with the aid of a Stiletto heel. The bruises and bumps are still present, this being a week on. I tried to defend mum but I was beaten down too much. Her with her bad back and all I didn't want to see her get injuried by these lunatics. I tried but if I had to do it again I would probably have kicked the ... bejesus out of the eldest. I hesitated, knowing that I could be charged for assult too.    They were put in the cells until 12am later that day. The real names of these people can't be found. No National Security Number, no real last name or first name. I'm trying to sue  Butlins  and get criminal damages paid for all I suffered.    I'll keep you all posted on whats happening with all t
