design of the piece begs for stillness, contemplation, and patience.  Three things we definitely need to work on in the 21st century!  I msut admit to being quite tempted to go back when nobody is around, and taking advantage of the invitation to 'be still, you might learn something!'  I am also quite keen to try my lock picking abilities on the chest that is placed in the centre of the room.  Pandoras box indeed!  Conceptual art at it's best - in little old Hamilton!  Nice one Dave.
It's at times like these that I realise just how lucky I am to be living in this wonderful country!  In New Zealand it is Winter,but yesterday was the most amazingly beautiful day; the kind of day you cannot help but think is a gift from the Goddess (and/or God). Wonderfully clear skies, sunny weather, no wind. Absolutely stunning!  Today is Imbolc; also known as Candlemass, Brigids day, and (I am informed) the Chinese New Year. On top of all that it was a full moon last night; the ice moon, or wishing moon! Lots to celebrate! Lots to do!  Imbolc - the very middle of Winter Solstice and Spring Equinox - the emerging light celebration. The Spring is on the way - Winter has had it's last and is slowly leaving. The animals are birthing; the milk is in! This is a celebration of newness! New beginnings, new starts. The Greek Maiden Goddess, Persephone, has returned from the underworld, and brings the promise of Spring with her.  It is a time to rejoice!!  So, we all gathered at our good friends house for fellowship, fun, frivolity, and a good old feeding up of each others ego's (which seem to get so depleted by the 'real world' we have to live in).  We sang, made Goddess sculptures, jumped on the trampoline, enjoyed a guided meditation, ate, drank, sang some more, laughed and cried. All in celebration of our wonderful planet and of US!  How empowering it is to meet with like-minded people and to have the ability to share in the gifts that surround us all. I feel so blessed that I have these amazing people in my life and we all share these precious times together.  The greatest message that Imbolc has to offer, I believe is this: When times seem the darkest, remember the light is not far away. Everything is circular; there IS no linear pattern! All of life works and moves in a cycle. When you are in a dark place, you will emerge into the light. You learn and grow stronger from this experience, and when you are next in a dark place the lessons you learned from your last visit will make you stronger again, thus allowing you to emerge even greater the second time, and so on.  Therefore, take courage; for the light always follows the darkness. Be thankful for the darkness; it is your teacher and heralds the light that will surely follow.  Brightest blessings until next time  Ka Kite Ano (see you again :D)  S
