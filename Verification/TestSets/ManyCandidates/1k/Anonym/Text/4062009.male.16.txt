a rough day, and its the first day! I will tell you what, this is the first "first day" of school that had to be my worst yet best too.  For starters, the day starts off well with American History and Website Design. Okay, no biggy. Then comes Physics, and yeah it doesn't seem to bad. It sure as hell shouldn't be worse then Chemistry, right? Anyway, I later on learn that I am going to Advanced Algebra &amp; Trig for 4th period! Boy what a jump from failing Algebra 2 second semester to Trig! Anyway, I go about my day and then I come to Language Arts and then finally Spanish 2. Okay, something is most def. not right here. I mean last year, I failed Second semester Spanish too. And from what my teacher said back then, I will not go to Spanish 2 until I complete Spanish 1 with a passing grade.  Well the teacher comes around and I tell her my problem. I then learn that I am not suppose to be in that class so I go to the councilors office to have everything settled down. While I was there, I asked him whether or not if I am suppose to be in discreet Math rather then Trig. He says he doesn't know, but he put in the class any so I no longer have Trig for this year. But he did say that I should go and ask the math teacher if such a thing needs to be done because of me failing Algebra 2. By gods great power and wisdom, I hope he is right. Because I myself know that I am not ready to go into Trig right now anyway. I mean don't get me wrong, it is okay if I do end up going. It's just that I might not stay in the B's in that class because I didn't get Algrebra so well. Understand?  Anyway, my day was, on average, an neutral day. LOL! Well, now I have to go. So I guess I shall talk to you guys and gals later.  P.S. If anyone would like to join, then let me know or do so. I don't know how the member thing works here but it would be cool to have at least 2 other schoolers here to share their day. You know, to ad some variety. LOL! Later!    Wolfwood
