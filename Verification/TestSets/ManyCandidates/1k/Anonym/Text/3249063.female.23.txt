damn cute today. I have adopted the Ellen DeGeneres look for today. I have on a tannish colored suit coat, a white button down shirt, a pair of OldNavy jeans and some brown low top boot looking shoes. My hair is spiked in all the right directions and I feel great. I have a final presentation tonight. Should be interesting. Next week I start a new class....Systems Thinking and Performance. We'll see how that goes. So far I have all A's and 2 B pluses.  My Monday morning has been great. Woke up at 430 ish....ate a banana and drank some OJ. Then I played bball at 530-7. Took a shower and got spiffy and came to KC to finish off my paper and practice my presentation. I am not overly stressed about it. I think I am ready....it just sucks to stand in front of a class full of people for 20-25 minutes. Oh well.  The plan is for me to work diligently on my homework til noon- then go lift weights til noon:30, have lunch at noon:30, shower and come back and study til 6. Class from 6-10.  This is an exciting week for me. I have a friend coming in town from Arkansas on Wed. She is staying with me from Wed til Sunday night. I took vacation from work from Wed til Tues. It should be a blast. She has never really been to KC, so we will spend most of our time there. I am excited to see what terms we are on when she leaves. There is alot of attraction there from both ends, but we both have had our share of relationship difficulties, personality clashes, or unhappiness with other people. My main problem with finding the right somebody is I hate the empty feeling. I don't necessarily need to be around them constantly, but I need to know that they feel the same way I do or that they are excited as much as I am. If I don't get that vibe from them, I either end it or seek the fulfillment elsewhere. I like vibrance and the last few relationships I have been in have not provided me with that, at least not consistently. Most of them have been really boring to me-and I HATE boredom. Sherri seems to be different. She is openly lesbian as I am. She is so exciting and full of life-as I am. We match really well. Even down to our interests in vegetarianism and fitness, from politics to traveling. We match. But I look at it like I am shopping for shoes. There have been times when I have purchased shoes just because they may match an outfit perfectly, at the same time, the same shoes only offered discomfort and pain-though they looked good. The same applies to my search for a somebody. I am really critically analyzing everything and I don't want to act too fast. We'll see.  Well, I am off for now. I have more to say-but I have to get this paper d
