Disease Friends Don't Let Friends Vote Republican If You Can Read This, You're Not Our President! No One Died When Clinton Lied Kerry/Edwards - They've Got Better Hair!  This is an  excellent  site:  urlLink http://tiedyes.com/timelybuttonsrf.html . Tons of liberal, anti-Bush, anti-war buttons. I'm gonna have to bug my parents about these...  [The Reactor] made up this one:     "Noocyalur"
What's your favorite part of the newspaper?  For me it's the editorial.  If I could have only one page of the newspaper, I would take the editorial page.  Or maybe the front page.  Let's just say that I'd go for section A.  Frankly, there's a lot of dumb people out there.  Then they write their annoying pro-Bush articles.  Make sure you read today's editorial, Elm.  There's a horrible letter about how Kerry is evil, etc. that really got under my skin.  But there was also a letter of questions to ask yourself about the candidates that was clear-cut, concise, and wonderful.
On the war in Iraq:  People tell me that the war in Iraq was necessary, that Saddam Hussein was a tyrant, and he was going to attack us with WMDs. After I finish laughing, I reply as follows:  "A) Although Saddam Hussein was a tyrant, he was killing fewer Iraqis than we have in our war. Isn't it also more important to focus on the welfare of our own country before we take into our own hands the welfare of another country? After our country is in working order (no multi-billion dollar defecit), then we can focus on other countries, some in far worse condition than Iraq. We can do this in peaceful ways, such as providing basic immunizations (the money spent in Iraq could have paid for basic immunizations for every child in the world for 42 years!).  B) Saddam had no weapons of mass destruction. And don't come back to me in a month or so telling me that I was wrong, because they 'found' WMDs, which they probably will. There have been numerous inside reports of WMDs being flown into the country, not to be dropped, but to be "found"."  Someone needs to teach "President" George W. Bush. I mean that in a literal, non-threatening way. Please don't arrest me I'm just a minor. (Damn Patriot Act)!
Quite frankly, I do not belong here.  Yes, I am a youth of the nation.  No, I am not informed.  No, my intelligence is not greater than that of many adults.  Yes, I have thoughts and opinions that differ from most.  No, they are not beyond the intelligence of any.  I guess all I've got is an annoying habit of forcing in my two cents worth.  But maybe that's all I need?
I have created this blog in hopes that similarly minded youth can get together and share knowledge, thoughts, and opinions. I hope this works out.
