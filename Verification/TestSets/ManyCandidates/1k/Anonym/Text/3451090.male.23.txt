a Saturday night.  Heading home from Greg’s party with directions to get to his house, I figured I’d reverse the instructions and end up back at my apartment.  A right on Thompson Road getting there would be a left on Thompson Road to come home, right? Well…not quite, since I turned out of his driveway in the wrong direction.  After about 20 minutes of fudging this new course, I rang Greg.  He and the rest of the party had moved to the bar, but he wasn’t picking up his cell.  Though I felt like crap physically and mentally, and I began to panic as I drove through increasingly seedier neighborhoods, I calmly left this message:  “Hey, GJ, it’s Jay.  If you get a chance, give me a call.  Thanks.”  I willed myself to keep the fear out of my voice, like someone would do when confronting an aggressive dog.  And I thought I’d succeeded until I heard Greg’s voicemail the next day:  “Hey, Jay.  I’m sorry I missed your call.  It’s 12:30a.  I hope you’re okay; you sounded like you were lost.  Call me back.”  Way to go Jay! That pit bull would’ve mauled me.  Apparently, when my feelings are running strong, I’m pretty terrible at masking them.  This is probably why I don’t play cards for money.  Another observation I’ve made, like many others in the male species I resist asking for directions until I’m completely, hopelessly lost.  And then I’ll only ask if I’ve been driving blind for 15 minutes and I’m near-panicked.  I finally pulled into a restaurant and asked the bartender, a spunky 40-ish brunette who chomped on her gum, how to get home.  She sent me on my way with perfect directions that I never would’ve determined on my own.  In my earlier frenzied state, I’d decided that if I couldn’t find my apartment, nor make my way back to Greg’s, I’d head for Aunt Virginia’s house across town.  I’d passed 690 at least five times, and I know that takes me to her home in Camillus.  I know I need to have a better attitude about getting around, but I’m discouraged when I can’t go out for groceries without heading over the river and through the woods.  If I wanted to live in Labyrinth, I’d have moved in with David Bowie and the Muppets.  Instead I live on Waldorf Parkway, a segment of the most poorly designed byway system since Venice.  Learning the roads will come with time, I just wish I were making progress.  After four days of driving, I’m no surer of where I am then when I began.  Except when I’m driving in circles.
I just got my Dave Fix.  The first song on Launch this afternoon was "The Song That Jane Likes." How amazing is that? I still remember cleaning construction lots for my dad during late November of 1996 and listening to "Remember Two Things" until I wore out the casette on my Walkman.  Old school DMB is still the best.  Also...what was Beezus' (from the Beverly Cleary books) real n
