does not stop here, oh no. You see, when i drove off i ended up driving around the block and because of this, our demon of the story decided to call the "law enforcements" (if you can even call them that around here) to have them tell me to give her my phone number and insurance information. Gee officer, did it take most of that half a dozen donuts you ate this morning to conjure up enough mind power to figure that one out dumb ass!!! But, once again, I returned home and conjured up my ingenius so that my parents pay for it all and I suffer minimal damage (much like my car)
Alright...for the last week or so, Ive been filling out job applications at random places (I say random places, because everywhere I go no one is hiring) I ask if they're hiring and I hear one of the following responses. A)No, but were always taking applications B)You have to be 18 to work here or C)Hell no, now get the F*#k out of my store!

Now if he was to say "you have to be 18 to work here" I could understand, because 18 your a legal adult but there is no difference between 16 and 17 except the fact that 17 is one year more than 16 and that my friends is f*#ked up. And, finally, story C was completely made up but i always thought it would be funny to go into some chinese restaraunt or something and ask the manager for a job application and hes a chef behind the counter and is like "no opening, you get out, get out my restraunt" then leaps over teh counter and chases me out w/ his knife flailing about screaming things in chinese at me. I, personally would laugh my ass off (even when I take the ass hole to court and sue his slanted eye, sideways vagina ass for all hes worth) In gods name we p
