my sleep and often times, it annoys me.  I dreamt of *Oreo* again! I've been dreaming about him countless times for so long now. After our 'so called'  closure,  if we can call it that way, because nothing was really put into end. (He has someone and I have mine, both rocky during that time.) I  try  not to think of him at all. Yep, I'm honest enough to admit it.  The moment our eyes met the first time, I felt there was something to explore. I was frightened so I decided to do everything to avoid him, or atleast not to be of speaking terms with him because of my boyfriend.  The more I stay away, the more we'd endlessly bump into each other. Again, my curiousity challenged me. I hate regrets so, I opted to see where will that chance take us. We had our moments. We enjoyed hanging out together, talking, just simply being together. (ooops! it's not what you think.) I can say that we somehow fall for each other... well, I'm speaking for myself this time=) I was moved by him. It became complicated for me (translation: what's with us?) because no one wanted to talk about it. No one was braved enough to start. Ok, fine...I was willing but he has his own fears which remained unknown to me. If one is willing &amp; brave and the other is willing but mousy, nothing will happen. To make the story short, we chose not to delve into it further.  I continued with my life project:   live life to the fullest  . I now follow my heart and do what I think will make me happy. Wherein sometimes it requires me to leave my comfort zone and later on finding out that I'm stronger no matter what the outcome. I detest regrets so I have to be strong and brave enough to put my toe in the water. Even if things wouldn't work out, I believe I would be a better person with all my experiences---good or not so good.  But then again, it boggles me at times on why he keeps on recurring in my dreams. Is there   something that should be done? Mystery.
I don't just like to shop, sometimes I NEED to shop---especially when I'm in a bad mood. It makes me feel better! Sometimes I habitually buy things I don't need (translation: I love to hoard stuffs,  takot maubusan ). There are times I get into fights with my boyfriend because of my spending habits. Often times, (if I can get away with it) I lie about how much I really paid for the stuff I bought. =) Oh, shopping can be an addiction, bad as gambling. Yeah, maybe I'm  a bit  of a shopaholic...but I will never ever admit it to Xave! =)
OK, this blog thingy has been arousing my curiousity for some time now and finally I've decided to give it a try. Why not? Let's see where will this take me... I'm a newbie here, so please bear with me. =
