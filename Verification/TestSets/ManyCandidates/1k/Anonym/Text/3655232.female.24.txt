the doom and gloom I've already begun to feel. Because now that I am truly alone, I'm being slowly overtaken by a dreaded sense that I will never find another Somebody. I'm not looking to rush out and become half of a pair of people again - I'm fine with my individuality, in fact I love it. But there sure are a lot of things that are fun to share with someone. And while I relish my freedom right now, and even feel as though I'd never want anything else, I still look at the possibility of becoming a spinster, a lady with a shitload of cats, and not much else.  Where do you meet people? How do you meet them? How does all of this stuff get started? I've had 3 real romantic relationships in my life. The first was Darius, whom I met in high school. The second was Ron, whom I met in two ways: the first time I saw him in person was at a party at Nate's house, but I think I had "spoken" to him before in teleconference on the "R" World BBS, back in the day. I met Scott at Gray's, when we both worked there. So my options for meeting people (historically-based) are school (which I'm still planning on doing, but I haven't actually taken the steps necessary to make it a reality), online (which is so much different than it was in 1997), and work (where there are 8 men: 5 of them are married, 2 of them are gay, and 1 of them is just not my type). I don't want to meet people in bars. I know that not everyone in any given bar is an alcholic, but given my experiences in my most recent failed relationship, I think I'd like to avoid anyone who makes a habit of going to the bar a lot. Where else?  And then there's the next step. After I figure out where, and then who, how am I going to get along with them? I like to think I have learned a lot of things from my previous relationships, but I feel rather neurotic about some of the things I've learned. And I don't want to be the untrusting girl. I don't want to be the girl that accuses and expects the worse of her partner. I don't want to be the girl who gets pissed when her partner wants to hang out with another friend, who happens to be a girl.  But maybe that's who I am. Reading  urlLink E 's blog, I found myself thinking,  how can she deal with that?  because her significant other is spending the next few days with an out-of-town friend who happens to be a girl. I felt jealous for her.  And none of this matters right now. I don't plan on trying to find a new Someone right now anyway. I expect that in all likelihood, it'll show up when I least expect it, out of the blue. And hopefully by then, I will be r
