I had perforce to be a distance student because I’m situated in Port Elizabeth and can only get to Tukkies three times a year.  So I’ve had enforced distance education, but haven’t really been part of a virtual learning community before.  Current Level of Dexterity using WWW  I feel fairly comfortable.  I use www.metacrawler.com a LOT because I find it suits my style of browsing.  I’ve often been disappointed with other search engines but seldom with metacrawler.  How accessible is the web for me in terms of finances?  That’s a tricky one!  Naturally I’d love to use the facilities at work (we have 24 hour a day access at school) but I prefer to work from the comfort of my own home.  With the help of the Tukkies bursary and a study loan I should be able to keep myself connected for the duration of the course!    My Typing Speed You really know how to put people on the spot!  I took Typing as a matric subject so I’m fairly comfortable with it.  It was the most sensible subject choice I made.  I typed fairly quickly at school and have still retained some of my old skill. (I typed this at 22:20 when I was very tired so I feel quite proud of my achievement!)      My Expectations of the Course  Every course in M.Ed. (CIE) has challenged me so far.  At times I resent the fact that I have to learn so many new things in so short a space of time, but in retrospect I must acknowledge that if the deadlines hadn’t been there, I would probably never have learned to use certain programs.  I expect to learn a lot more about chatting – I’ve only done this once or twice before and must confess that I’m not a natural-born web-chatter.  Perhaps I prefer to see people’s expressions so that I can react to them.  With a structured chat environment and focused topics, I expect to develop a greater level of comfort in this area.  I certainly expect to learn as much as I did with both the previous modules.  I’ve already learned to chat, and how to use a whiteboard!  I’m slowly learning about the basic components of my computer e.g. the sound cards etc.  I’m very excited about being forced to learn how to publish a blog and the various things that go along with that.  Whether I’ll be successful remains to be seen ……
