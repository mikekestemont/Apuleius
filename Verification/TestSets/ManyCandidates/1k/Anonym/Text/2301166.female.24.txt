of women's tennis at Wimbledon, mainly so I can finally get some sleep.   Before you landed I had a will but didn't know what it could do You were abandoned And still you're handing out what you don't wanna lose You make me drop things Like all the plans I had for a life without you  Someone to die for Someone to fall into when the world goes dark Someone to die for Someone to tear a hole in this endless night Someone like you  I'm drunk when sober The room is spinning  You are what I hold on to You're taking over I find that giving in is the best I can do  Someone to die for Someone to fall into when the world goes dark Someone to die for Someone to tear a hole in this endless night Someone like you
Prior to my departure to the snows, I have to quote one of the many great lines from  Angels in America :   Nothing's lost forever   In this world there's a kind of painful progress   Longing for what we left behind   and dreaming ahead     What a strange, funny, and wonderful series.
Idiom: cheek by jowl   Side by side; close together.  Apparently, also the name of one of the ten great theatre companies in the world.  So anyway, I went to see their production of   Othello   last night. I had scored myself and a friend free tickets by entering in a giveaway competition at uni and surprise surprise!  I have to say,   Othello   isn't one of my fave Shakespearean plays. There is nothing outstanding about the story, and there seems to be a running theme in all of Shakespeare's plays.  What theme? Well,   communications  ! If these people would just  talk  to each other, then there would be no great tragedy to unfold. I think William is trying very hard to tell us that we need to talk more.
Looks like my food poisoning phase has passed. Just had myself two juicy bacon and egg muffins and no tummy aches, touch wood.  I really feel for muslims and jews and whoever else that can't eat bacon. I don't think I can live without bacon. Bacon bacon bacon!  Of course, you might say that what they don't know won't hurt them, but it does. It does.
I think I've got food poisoning... except that I ate so many different things at so many different places I can't pin point exactly what's causing it.  The symptoms are mild I suppose, I just can't eat anything cos they come straight out. I can't afford to spend all day sitting on the loo so I'm starving myself and hoping it'll pass soon. I'll have to try taking a vitamin when I get home and see if that gets rejected as well.  I am never buying a new pair of shoes again!  (until I see one I can't live without, of course)  Both pairs of my new shoes caused me much pain and suffering on the weekend. How long is it going to take to break them in? S
