the time of reading this summers best sellers â€“ but then again so does the Readers Digest, which usually pays publishers a bit of money to provide an edited version.  Might this be an infringement of copyright???  I'll ask them - and let you know...
Internet is restored to home! Took the new hardware off and put the old hardware back and we are back to norman (to quote Rugrats)  Even better news - Moof is sorting out the Tippers League for this season.  Jason sold Sean Davis a very nice watch today - ex Fulham now Spurs midfield dynamo.  Good day!!!
I rather foolishly upgraded my Broadband access with BT last week and three ton of equipment appeared through the post. I can now set up my own wireless network as well as telephone on the web... when I get the blooming thing working - which I had done with much success last night. So best bet is to email me at work.  If you haven't got it blog me!!!
Naomi found my stepometer in the toilet at work (Yes we are very Ally McBeal at the office - even if it is one toilet - too much information I know!)  I had up until around 4.30 yesterday done 6363 steps - so the walk to Kings Cross and the slight jog to avoid the lightening from Southgate may not have taken me to 10,000 daily steps... but hey I'm getting there. What with all this fruit I'm eating since Linda has opened a greengrocers at our house... I shall be svelte like in no time.  Also the Fulham residence was not flooded - according to Nell.  I'm getting slightly worried because we are already in August and XE in Australia has not sent any rules for this season's footy tipping competition...
Had just done 6,000 plus steps using me new MaccyD stepometer and it fell off me belt - unbeknownst to me!!! Shall have to have another MaccyD salad... bummer.  Awaiting the storm damage report on the Fulham house from the girls when they get back from St Matthews tonight. Around All Saints appears to be OK according to Em - but she hasn't been home since the storms...
Just a quick one this morning.   My mum is against Sky taking on NYPD Blue because they don't have Sky - but I would video it and send it her if they did. She is also a late night Channel Four videower so she can see it at a decent time!!!  Nell took me to McDonalds lastnight - which didn't blow me red day green day diet I am tracking Linda with - as I went for the grilled chicken salad and it was brilliant - not only that - I got a pedometer! This is better than Special K pedometer, which although does more things, like translates steps into kilometres walked, the MacD pedometer has a cover so doesn't reset accidentally - which the Special K did most times (very annoying!!)  Em is on her second day of fashion design at All Saints C
