whatever I want.  The lack of focus is a great plus, it fits my personality perfectly.  A lack of focus in the real world is less than ideal.  Sometimes I wish I just had someone to point me in a direction and say "Do this", and then I will attack it, and do it.  I can do almost anything I set my mind to.  It's not arrogance, but rather simple fact.  I was one of those annoying kids in school that got good grades without even trying.  It's the setting one's mind to something that is the problem.  I remarked to someone not long ago that the fact that I never had to work very hard in school made me lazy and unambitious.  I think it is finally starting to catch up with me.    Time to focus on a direction.  I'll start tomorrow.  Or maybe Monday.  Eventually at least.
It is practically accepted fact to most people that prescription drugs are substantially cheaper in Canada than in the U.S.  What people don't know, is that generics are substantially more expensive there as well.  While searching google I found this  urlLink paper(pdf)  on the issue.  The difference in prices is stark.  The paper found that a weighted mean of the drugs surveyed were 37% more expensive in Canada than in the U.S.  Some were significantly more expensive, one over 10 times as much.  That translates to almost C$400 million in extra costs vs the U.S. prices when extrapolated across all the various generic drug purchases in Canada.  Certainly nothing to sneeze at.  So what causes this difference?  The same thing that causes lower prescription prices in Canada: price controls.  With the Canadian government (and its provinces) controlling drug prices, the price for generics is set centrally, and therefore is practically immune to reduction by competition.  This, in large part, is because instead of many manufacturers trying producing a generic after the drug's patent expires, many times only the two largest will start producing it.     While most top-selling generics are produced by several suppliers, the market for each product tends to be dominated by one or two companies. Apotex and Novopharm are the two largest generics manufacturers in Canada and account for more than half of the total Canadian generics market (in terms of both prescriptions and sales revenues). These two companies dominance of the market for many products may make it difficult for other manufacturers to compete and for new generics firms to enter the market.  Certainly not a recipe for price wars.  This makes one wonder several things.  For one, as the paper also expressed interest about, does this hold true for Europe as well?  Countries there have health care systems much more similar to Canada than the U.S.  For another, since price controls cause both lower prescription prices, and higher generic...what is the overall benefit of price controls?  While I have little doubt that when looking at prices the benefit is still there, at what cost does it come?    Definitely something that should be considered in the overall health care d
