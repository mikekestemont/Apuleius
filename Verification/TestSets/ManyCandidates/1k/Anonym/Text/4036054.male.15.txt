The Wheels on the Bus) and shared with me the story of his lateness: He was forced into the Old Navy and had to go fly air missions in Iraq.  Wait, no, he just went to Old Navy and got a haircut, I think.   Either way, we were pretty much the only players there, plus one other guy who I think might have been someone else from the forums, but I wasn't sure.  He could have been the Easter Bunny.   After three hours of straight DDR, I developed a sharp pain in my left foot's small toe.  After removing my socks to look at the damage, the damage was quite evident.  I had torn off the skin on that particular toe.  It hurt.  A lot.  So, I did a socks-freestyle round and then left.  Cheers, I suppose.
Ah, vacation!  A break from the fast-paced, manic pulse of the city at a beautiful lake that was once used as a sewage repository.  That was only the beginning of Day One's troubles.  Not many people know this, but not too far into Arkansas is a little country called Arkanistan.  You don't usually find it on the map, but it is most definitely there.  In Arkanistan, the average Joe is about as competent at what he does as a midrange toaster oven.  Don't get me wrong, I tried to keep an open mind about Arkanistan's population, I tried to believe that not everyone there was an idiot, but I was promptly disproved of that on numerous occasions.

That is of course, loosely translated into English as "fuck you in the skull, brown-eyes."  So, I didn't get my money back, and I returned to the hotel.  Now, this hotel is probably the only nice thing I found in Arkanistan.  The sheets were nice, except for the blood stains on mine, which were promptly removed by men in black coats, the reception on TV was great, and my room was right across from a vending machine. That was the shining moment in Day One.  The hotel.  Of course, the people there are idiots, nubskulls and hicks who seem to enjoy shrieking in the hallways at 2 AM.     Now for the next d
