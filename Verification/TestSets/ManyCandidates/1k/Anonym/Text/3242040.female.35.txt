water we will move on and set up home.   Taylor was initially a little apprehensive about the idea, but he is getting use to the idea and is looking forward to 'swimming with the dolphins' when we get to the Keys. Taylor will be home schooled using a system called Switched on Schoolhouse. This is an computer program that we think Taylor will really enjoy. I think that Taylor will flourish in that environment. I plan on having him update this site with his own news in the very near future. :)   The question has been asked....Why now? This has been something we have wanted to do for a long time. We attempted this one other time, as some of you may recall. We moved on a sailboat, however the timing was just not right. Since that time we have learned a lot. The other concern is that Arnold's eyes have gotten worse. We have come to realize that if we do not move forward with this trip now, we may never get the opportunity. I must say that a lot of prayer went into planning this trip and it is amazing how well everything has come together. God has really be blessing us.   So where did we get the name for the our boat,  Imagine ? Actually from church. Our church, SeaCoast, did a series last year entitled  Imagine the Possibilities . It was during that time that we were deciding to take off for the adventure of a life time. It seemed very appropriate that we would name the boat  Imagine . And believe me when I say that we are Imagining the Possibilities!!!!   We hope that you will check in often and see the progress of our preparations, not only for the boat but for our house. Please bare with me and I am learning how to use webposting and will try to post pictures in the very near future.
urlLink    Taylor got a lesson on how to row the dinghy in the event the motor stalled.  Looks like he his working hard.  Row Taylor Row!
We&nbsp; saw&nbsp; three&nbsp;dolphins on&nbsp;the&nbsp;boat today.&nbsp; The dolphins got up close to the boat and turned and looked at us.&nbsp; It was really coooooolll.  &nbsp;
urlLink    Well we have finally made a decision regarding our house.  We weren't sure whether to sell or rent....the verdict....RENT.  Our Charleston friend's are happy (they are now convinced that we will come back).  Arnold is happy...we stay in the real estate market.   A property management company is happy, they have more business.  We just pray that we get a good renter who doesn't trash our house while we are gone!  Now it is time for a BIG yard sale....it is never ending!
Only a few weeks listed in the paper and....the house is rented!  A lease was signed yesterday so we have to be out of our house by August 31.  We will be moving on the boat and setting up 'house' there.  The days are clicking away on the calendar.   Yikes I really do need to have a yard s
