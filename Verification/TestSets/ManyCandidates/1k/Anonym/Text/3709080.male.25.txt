hi guys me back again after almost a week of hiatus..well nothin special in here..but the last whole week was full of fun..lot of learning at the office..learned a lot of stuff regarding trading and brokering..from the way it is going i think i will be mostly overseeing the Indian as well as Middleeast Oil market...seems to be fun.. Last friday we had the orientation party thrown to us by all the traders and brokers of the firm. It was a night full of booze and party. first we all went to excellsior hotel , which is famous for its pool game and girls. we played pool for like 1 hour and then played the game of dies. The game is played in such a way that the guy who looses in each round has to drink one full glass of whiskey.Man it was somethign.drank drank and drank until i couldnt stand properly. after the game we all went to have korean style dinner and another round of drinking. the korean style is such that if someone in ur table offers u a drink u have to accept it however bad condition u r in. Again got fully boozed there.. the last stop was at the famous "50's" the famous pub of s'gpore... We all were given one girl as well as drinks to "play" with..By the time i reached 50's i could no longer stand on my feet. and finally came home by about 3 in the morning and a nice sleep....saturday and sunday was fully spend at the airport. my friends were coming from US , another one going to US and another going to India. In short most of the time was spend at the airport specially saturday and sunday evenings...  nothin special happening here. as of the moment i am enjoying my work ...lets see how much pressure i can stand as the market is really bearish now .. and bearish market means more tension and p
