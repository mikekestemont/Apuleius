times you come in) you lose your nerve, wander off, perhaps in search of a new target, and eventually you go home without having accomplished your goal. But tomorrow is another day, and you will be back to try again. The dance will continue.   Sometimes you do not leave. Sometimes you are a persistent stalker. You have finally work up the courage to speak to her, and after all, she seemed interested in your conversation about the weather. So you continue. Are you seeing anyone? You are. Is it a serious relationship? It is. Well, perhaps some other time then? No. Oh.   No, we will no date you, will not get a bite to eat with you, or a cup of coffee, or tea, or what ever. We are busy ladies with busy lives and busy boyfriends, partners, and husbands. Leave us alone. We are taken, spoken for, kept.  We are already in love.   You are a fly on the wall that is suddenly buzzing in our faces and we desire only to kill you. You and the rest of the wackos, weirdoes and stalkers that frequent the bookstore.
ugh.. I was taking a nice little nap and havingsome weird dream that had a group of chicks roofing a house for some odd reason, and ponies, there were ponies, brought by some old couple that were supposed to be distant relatives of mine. And someone told me they would take me to work, and I went over to their car as they were getting ready to leave and they were alittle confused about the whole thing, but took me nonetheless. Weird dream. Anyway, it was rudely interupted by the ringing phone, and I though maybe it was D calling, but why would he call right now? And I was confused. So now I'm awake and have an hour and 45 minutes before I have to go to work, and I'm still a little asleep. And despite being off of work for three days in row, and complaining about it because I won't have any money, I still don't want to go. Not that it's a horrible place - it's ok once you get their - but I would much rather sleep. And I would much rather get out of there at a reasonable hour like 10pm instead of 11:30pm. But there isn't a lot I can do about that.
Hey there. This is Penguina.  Ok, that's not my real name, but that's all you're gonna know. This blog is 100% anonymous. No one I know knows it exists. I have another blog somewhere in the wild blue yonder of the internet but you'll never know which one among the billions it is. Why? Because this is where I write the real stuff. The personal stuff. The stuff about my family and friends and loved ones that isn't so pretty. Names have been changed to protect identities. Here my boyfriends name is D and his daughter is B and my best friend's name is A. That is all you need to know for n
