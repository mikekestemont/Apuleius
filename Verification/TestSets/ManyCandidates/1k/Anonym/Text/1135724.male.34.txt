I can't see the truth in this.  Sainath says:  Economists C. Mahendra Dev and C. Ravi show that "in the 1980s, A.P. was one of the top performing states in terms of Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) growth. Only three states, Rajasthan, Haryana and Maharashtra, showed higher growth than A.P. in the 1980s." However, this rank sank from number four to eight in the next decade. "Seven states showed higher growth than A.P. in the 1990s." The State was overtaken by Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal.  I am still puzzled by how Tamil Nadu ruled by Karunanidhi and Jayalalitha, prone to nepotism, corrupt to the core and whimsical (certainly the latter) could push the state ahead of another state ruled by a man who seemed intelligent, honest, focused, charming and powerful (as he controlled the Government at the centre).  As to whether Naidu is corrupt or not, Sainath's final paragraph is quite revealing.  The media bios of Naidu called him the son of a "poor agriculturist." Or of a "small farmer." Or of a "modest farmer." How the modest farmer and his spouse came to be worth Rs. 21 crores after nine years in power is a mystery no one wants to solve. That's the figure you'll find in his poll-time declaration of assets. But no questions. The king could do no wrong.
Wanted to blog this last week, but forgot the source. I think it was in Economic Times. Can't find it in Google.  Amul will be setting up a Anand, Gujarat type experiment in Sri Lanka. They will invest about Rs. 10 crores to set up a co-operative milk procurement movement. Initially, milk from Tamil Nadu will be taken via sea and sold in Sri Lanka under the Amul brand. In due course, proper co-operative set up will be built and then the venture will be trasferred to the local co-operatives. This venture will be allowed to decide their own brand, or use Amul brand by paying royalty to Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) that owns the Amul brand.  As of now Sri Lanka imports milk powder from outside the country.  Previous item:  urlLink Food: M.S.Swaminathan appointed head of National Commission on Farmers
