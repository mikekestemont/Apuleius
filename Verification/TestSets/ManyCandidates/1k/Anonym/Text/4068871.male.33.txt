networks have reduced their level of coverage as a responce to market forces. But why has the market gone in this direction? Is it because we as Americans don't care as much? Or because we have found alternative sources for news and information that we deam to be better, for whatever reason, than the networks provide? I think it is because a large number of people look elsewhere for their news and information and turn to the networks for entertainment - the "if it bleeds, it leads" model. People know that ABC, NBC, and CBS are not the places to turn to for real news and information, and the three don't seem too concerned with alterting that perception.
Everyone it seems tried to make a story out of Teresa Heinz telling a reporter to "shove it." Big deal. How come no one latched on to the real story?  The real story was WHY she told the reporter to shove it. Minutes earlier she gave a speech where she called something "un-American". That was her exact word.  After the speech, the reporter asked her to clarify what she meant by that. She denied ever saying it. When he pressed her, she accused him of putting words in her mouth and continued the denial. Finally she stormed away without answering his legitimate question.  She returned seconds later to once again accuse the reporter of putting words in her mouth and ended the confrontation by telling him to "shove it."  The phrase itself is meaningless. But it is her denial and subsequent reaction on which we should be focusing.  It's not her opinions that are in question, but rather her stability.
The new polls out this morning show that Kerry received about a 4 point bump after the convention. With the margin of error, this means that he may or may not have received any bump at all, and that Bush and Kerry are pretty much tied.  Personally, I think that this has a lot to do with the limited coverage that the networks gave the Democratic convention last week. I know that it was covered to various degrees on other cable channels and on PBS, but there are still a lot of people out there that watch only the networks. And unless you interrupt "The Price is Right" or "Fear Factor" they simply are not going to tune in.  Another factor in the non-bump is probably the fact that there was no news coming out of the convention. Kerrey announced his running mate weeks before. And although the speechs were very good in some cases, no one really revealed any details of their plans to change the country.  On other other hand, if Bush's camp thinks that they are going to get a huge bump from their upcoming convention, they should think again. The networks are probably not going to cover their get-together any better than they did Kerry's. And unless Bush discusses specifics on how he is going to accomplish his goals I am afraid that it too will be a huge news n
