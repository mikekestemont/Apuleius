had failed to do for weeks now... Waking up early enough for breakfast on a Saturday morning.
*********************************************************** ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE DAY GONE BY Read this arbit novel by Margaret Atwood. Crappy time-pass. And watched Shrek 2 again. Height of joblessness. Plan to read Economic Theory. *********************************************************** Today is a much better day. The sun has shown some mercy by going to  rest for a while behind the clouds. Yet I feel bad about leaving Dehradun at the cool foothills of the Himalayas and now sweating it out in MADras. I want to get on with some real work now but can't seem to get any. It seems it'll be so at least till July 1. Till that time I have to kill time.
This is my first June in IIT Madras. Although I am in the final year of my stay this is the first time I am in Chennai in June. You can have a vague idea of the amount of joblessness here which has compelled me to take up this pastime. June is that time of the year here when sun and water combine to produce a heady concoction in the atmosphere which makes you squirm with discomfort and insects dance with glee. Imagine what that trickle of sweat slipping down your back would be thinking. What would be its last thought as it is soaked up by your shirt (or if its incredibly lucky by your (under/)pants)???? Will it have achieved its Nirvana or does it get doomed to a perpetual cycle of annihilation and rebirth??? The answers to such profound questions are not easy to come by. Our oversimplified world view does not have the capacity or even potential to comprehend such phenomena. That girl you have always liked and wanted to take ome to mom walks past you. And you wipe seat off your forehead and curse the damned Chennai June which has you looking like a sponge just freshly plucked out of an overflowing kitchen sink.That girl is  now a pink dot in the distance, like the morning star on the horizon talking to the most dreaded prof in the institute. And even the professor seems to be sweating. His day has begun with a bang and he won't have time to consider what sweat drops think. Now there seems to be a little naughty sweat drop on that girls neck. I saw it twinkle there in the morning sun. And now it has begun its expedition of exploration down the path every guy here wants to walk. Doesn't it all come round a full circle. The commonality between my thoughts and thoughts of that sweat drop--- so this long discussion had some meaning to it after all.
And, lo, there were blogs all over. Some long ones , some short covering the long and short of it all. People read , at least some do here in India. Some write and some type. And so there are blogs all over for people to read. TRASH.... Random midnight typing cannot produce Paradise Lost, War and Peace m
