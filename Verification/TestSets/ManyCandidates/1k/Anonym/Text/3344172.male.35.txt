in anyway. We went back thru town remarking the route because of the rain and then went an additional 10 miles into Armada MI to a pie store called Achatz Handmade Pie company (the one we went was at 75700 North Avenue in Armada). Since we told the riders about this place, the owner gave Keith and I free pieces of pie. All I can say is that this is by far the best pie you can ever have. They have a website at  urlLink www.achatzpies.com  and they ship. Trust me...its fantastic. Better than s.. uh .....OK...maybe not but damn good. A nice way to end a day...along with the tacos, burgers, and pizza we had for dinner tonight. Please poke me because I am done.
August 2-3, 2004 - Mt. Pleasant to Frankenmuth, MI (88 miles)     Well the big birthday finally came. Seemed so distant but as of now I am officially 35 years of age and smelling up the downtown Frankenmuth Library after an exhausting 88 mile ride. The ride itself was fairly uneventful except for this carved statue about 4 miles out. Turns out someone carved a man holding a paint can (its located in front of a paint store) with his hand. The only problem with this concept is that he has only one arm and the arm is protruding from... shall we say...his nether region (that's crotch for you people who need to get to the point).

I entered the town of Shepherd and put down a few arrows on the roda near a turn. This pickup truck with two good ol' boys saw what I was doing from across the street and made a U-turn to follow me out of town. There truck had a yellow light as well as signage indicating it was a city vehicle. They did not attempt to stop me but did follow me...rather..tail me out of town. This is supposed to be an adventure but the last thing I need is Bubba and company taking me out back to be shot or worse....somehow the theme from the movie Deliverance entered my head at this time.  We are now in the town of Frankenmuth which is a quaint little village totally decorated like a German village. Everything is about brats and beer..two very good things. Its a bit tacky as I rode past the largest Xmas store but its a fun change from the large open spaces of nothing. Looking forward to going out later and having one to celebrate the big "3-5".  Better go check on my bike as I left it outside...the last thing I want to see is some dude in Liederhosen running off with my b
