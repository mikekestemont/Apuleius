at work...    On top of all the madness at work, I'm going to have to close down my UK company that was so close to being launched (was just waiting for an OK from the bank...) due to legal complications. Basically, you can't have a company based and billing in the UK, and do most of your work and live outside of the UK. Well, I tell a lie, actually you can, but you end up needing two accountants - one in each country, having a tonne of paperwork, and spending most of your income on tax, social security costs, and accountant fees... I was advised by a lawyer friend of ours of another, less complex way of doing it, so I'll be looking into that this weekend. It's really annoying though, because I have four completed web-work contracts waiting to be invoiced, and another one coming along soon: a fair bit of cash. It is really tempting to sod this full-time job I'm working at now (well, while I'm not writing my blog, of course!), and starting up a proper web business down here. I know I'd love it, as developing web sites and tools is what most interests me, but fincancially it's tricky. Maybe when my better half gets a full-time job, then I'll consider it more seriously, but for the moment we need to have at least one sure source of income...    Might be going to see Pink tonight in concert at Juan-Les-Pins - just going to ring the Fnac (ticket place) to see if there are any tickets left, and how much they cost.
Well, that weekend went by pretty quickly! Time really does fly, when you're having fun (or just when you don't want it to...). New week, same old work. It's actually feeling a little hectic, so I reckon I'll keep this diary entry short. However, before I leave you to return to whatever it was that you were doing, I'll tell you briefly about dinner at BJ's last night. Just imagine the setting: Le Rouret, a quiet and small town halfway between the Mediterranean sea and the Alps, with a gorgeous view of both. BJ really hit a jackpot with the place he's renting. He's paying about 1,000 Euros / month for it, but for that he's got a great 200 years-old village-style rock walled house on top of one of the hills in Le Rouret, far from the main road, and with three decent sized floors (like 30m2 each level, approximately) all for himself. That's about twice what we're paying for our place in Valbonne village, but it's easily twice as big, and twice as nice... Jammy bloke :-)    Hey, a nectarine! That'll do nicely for my mid-afternoon snack... and then back to work.    Oh, and in case you were wondering, no - I never did get round to renting a Hobie cat over the weekend. But where there's a will, there's a way, right? One of the weekends, it will be mine. Oh yes, it will be mine (for an hour or t
