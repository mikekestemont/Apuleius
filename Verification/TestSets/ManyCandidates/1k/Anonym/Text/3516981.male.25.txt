work that had finaly been shut down.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This also explains why the YSC quality checkers were being so damn hard on us.   In Deersdale all four of the Fredericton thinners who had yet to quit (including myself) started working together on blocks so that we'd all be done at the same time should any Fredericton ground open up.&nbsp; This was good since the cutting was terrible.&nbsp; Spruce so thick that you couldn't see the blade at the end of your saw.&nbsp; We also broke two saws slowing down the process significantly.&nbsp; I blew both crank seals in my saw which set me back $75.&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy I travell with completely destroyed his saw by&nbsp;melting the crank bearings and then insisting on still trying to use it.&nbsp; I wasn't there that day but everyone told him to stop but his stubborness and lack of knowlege of engines landed him with $778 worth of repairs to his saw.&nbsp; They warrantied $600 of it but it might get disalowed once the parts get to the manufacturer.&nbsp; Keep in mind that a brand new saw is only around $1000.&nbsp; The saw shop now hates him so hopefully he wont require any more work before the season's out and things cool down.   Anyway after all this the rate in Deerdale was only $385/hectare but was worth atleast $550.&nbsp; Three fast thinners still took 3 days to do a single hectare and we bured 36 tanks of gas between us.&nbsp; That works out to less than half of what we would expect to make on a a shitty day.&nbsp;  In the end we all quit working for the contractor we'd been with for the start of the season.    Three of us have ended up with a new super small outfit (4 guys and a foreman including us) and are working fairly close to town.&nbsp; The outfit seems kind of rinky-dink so hopefully there's no problems getting paid.&nbsp; The other guy had ended up working with an outfit thinning about an hour away with some of the guys from our original crew that quit 2 weeks before we did.   In the end everyone's still&nbsp;got work and were's not getting lied to (hopefully)&nbsp;everyday like we were so here's hoping for a good last month of thinning.&nbsp; I'm done to go back to university the first of September.

Yesterday I said "The saw shop now hates him so hopefully he wont require any more work before the season's out and things cool down"  Well.. today at 12:00pm noon his angle gear died.&nbsp; That's a $322 part once taxes are added and fuck do I ever feel sorry for him.&nbsp; His warantee period ran out 5 days ago (the day he blew up last time) and the total repairs he's put into his saw in the last 2 weeks, even discounting the warranteed items comes out at $500-some doallars.. more than enough to buy a whole new saw, used.
