DAMMIT - so i checked my voice mail and i had two messages from him. my damn phone never rang.. its been messed up all day, saying "searching for service".. so i called him back and got his voicemail and left a message explaining what happened. his voicemails to me we kinda sad sounding. his first one just explained he was gonna go ahead and go to sleep since i didnt answer and rest his back... the second one he apologized for offering to call and said it was probably best that he didnt. i dunno whats best. but now i can't sleep too well. ah isnt life grand. lol okay it really is grand.. but still - it gets poopy sometimes.  i got my wgi dvd! woop woop. pride of cinci rocks my socks off. http://www.prideofcincinnati.com come see the show! i love them so much. *yaaawn* but yeah i was very excited to finally get it.  i've been spinnin alooot the past three days. total spinning time for mon-wed = (approx.) 4hrs30mins. wee. its been nice to be out in the heat. enjoying the sun. speaking of the sun.. the moon has been gorgeous the past few nights.. argh - i forgot to mention that. j called me tues. night to tell me to go out and look at the moon. in a way it was very sweet b/c he knows how i love things like that - but what am i sposed to think... oh well - go with tha flow! no biggie.  i have had so much trouble trying to catch up with court and renee.. we keep missing each others phone calls!! it makes me sad. you know what makes me happy though?
