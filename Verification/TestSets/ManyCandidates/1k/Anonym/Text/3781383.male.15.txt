took a car).  The party was VERY nice.  When we go there after the tour I look around and said, "There are a lotta pretty women here..."  The oldest Minto child is a girl who is like 22.  Her name is Mandi.  She seemed to have brought a couple of her friends along with her.  I spent most of my time with them.  We talked about how highschool has changed and she noticed the sandals I was wearing.  They are the filp=flops with a strap instead of that toe thing.  They are black maroon and gold and say cardinals highschool on them.  She was ranting about how the cardinal shop never hooked them up with cool stuff like that.  I actually got them at wal-mart for like 7 bucks.  We got a new boat the next day.  It was another 20 footer, same brand, but it had seats.  It had a rear entry with built-in ladder, a tow cable for tubing, and a 50 horse/4-stroke/Merc that is really fast for a pontune that size.  We can pull a tuber but not a skier, the motor isn't THAT strong.  My grandparents came up and some meanial stuff happened.  My mom and I were alone for the last week because my dad obviously has to work.  On his last night here we went out ith his buddies on our boat.  Dad got smashed and we all laghed because he could barely stand up.  He also had a loss of short term memory.  He was fine the next day and flew out at about 11.  The trip home was about the same as the way up.  Now I'm getting ready to go hang out with one of my friends.  If one of my friends is readying this, call me when I get home.  I have a lot of summer to make up for.  Thanks for reading!  Mood-figity Music-vh1 cntry music (channel 114 on charter digital)
Hi everybody.  I'm sorry about the long wait.  I forgot I was keeping a blog.  I also was debating whether to use this or a Live Journal.  You obviously can see what I wanted to choose.  I was talking to a friend the other day I haven't seen or talked to in a while.  Her name is Kelley.  She was telling me about this nice guys finish last thing her boyfriend sent her.  I read over it and it sounded a lot like me.  I showed it to a few other friends and they said it hit the nail on the head.  All of it except this part about being the guy who is the designated driver and not taking advatage of girls at the door, cause I'm only 15 and can't drive by myself yet.  The link to it is:  urlLink http://www.stwing.upenn.edu/~jenf/writing/rant04.html .  One part sounds a lot like something that happened about a month ago.  If you are a close friend, you know which part.  Well, that is it for now.  If I post tommorow it will probably be about my schedual and back to school stuff.  T
