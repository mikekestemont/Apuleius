way to start a day.  Then went for chinese. i owe the teacher so many compos liao. Gonna lose count soon. So paiseh when she asked me for them. No more reasons to explain liao. =P Gonna pia them all tonight. lol~  (i've been saying that for quite some time..)   Studied abit tonight. hHhm.. Gave Weichong his birthday present. =D  Oh ya. YouTian, Sarah, JunYun, PuiShan and I rehearsed our skits today. It was a joke man. So funny. But it was great. Some tummy massage. Laughing throughout. I've learnt something. Don underestimate YouTian. Behind that innocent look, is a stupid lame girl. Oh ya, she's a great actor. lol~  Gonna finish up my work.  Adios.
Hello.  Had a great day in church today. The sermon was about PApa and MaMa. I can choose my friends. I can choose my spouse. But this relationship is too important. That's why God took away my choice. He gave me what's best for me. =D I'm not called DEnniS ONg by chance. God don make mistakes. Erh. Maybe He does. Sometimes..  (glaring at my brother.)   lolx~   Eh. Went to music after that. Then went to school to study with Weichong. Yeaha. Explored another area of the rooftop with him. Took out some windows. I told him we needed at least 3 pieces of the windows out. He insisted on 2. In the end, guess wad? Fatty us. We took out 4 pieces. Dirtied our pants, hands.. It was great fun. lol~  Oh ya. it poured heavily after that. So we decided to go into the toilet to study. Yeaha. I learnt my Kreb's cycle in the gents. Sounds horrible huh? But it's quite a nice place to study. lol~ And Weichong nearly left his wife in the toilet. (His new racket). lolx~ so absent minded. And he gave her a whole lot of kisses when we took it out from the toilet.. How clean right? lolx~  Anyway, looking forward to tomorrow. To study hard and pia hard. And the day after tomorrow. To be able to dine with Xiaoying.  Adios. =)
