get to go for my swim. anyway, my back hurts and my knees r all wobbley. i just wanna be still. but i'm not sleepy. so i'll just sit here and be still for a while. night people.
i just got done doin some work stuff and i thought i'd be tired but i'm all awake. so now i'm just here chillin playing with my awesome hair. and thanks geri. urs is the shit too! claudia left her ps2 here and i've been playing splinter cell for the past week. well, at least i've been trying to play that dumb game. it's funny how these things fuck with u. it's got me hooked so i've been playin for quite a while now. i was driving down nolana today and passed by the movies. i wanted to see what was showing and i was squinting like crazy and wanted to put my night-vision goggles on already. these games r retarded. i think i'ma give it back to her so  i can find something else to do with my time like clean this friggin house up a bit. i don't want it to start smelling like ass. nono not cuz of me. people are always here. ok well i'ma go do something else that i prolly shouldn't be doing either. good night people.
So i just started this thing and i'm already slacking off. It's only cuz i wasn't here.  family from mexico came and i let them borrow my house. not cuz i'm nice or anything it's just that my sister bel who's getting married went to some church marriage retreat thing and she wanted someone to housesit. well my house is closer to my mom's than hers is so i let the mexico people stay here while i stayed at her place. kinda complicated, i know, but whatever trevor. anyway, i made everyone go over there to hang out but it was just alright. on friday we watched fast and the furious and gone in 60 secs and drank alcoholic beverages. wasn't exciting at all. yesterday i went to the mcallen all day and bought all kinds of stuff and then chilled at my mom's house. today the whole fam came over cuz fatty made burgers and chicken wings and we were all here. it was nice. oh oh oh i bought a flat iron from some infomercial and i love ittttt!!! it's the shit! it was a little pricey but i just love my hair. anyway, i pretty much had a boring weekend except for my cool hair. i didn't go to houston but i'm going this weekend. blah! i hate houston. oh i went to go see the village. i can't decide whether i liked it or not. i mean it was pretty good, but....um....ugh how do i say this without giving it away for those people who still haven't seen it. ummmm......fuck it. i wanted to damn monsters to be real or something. they were made up!! how disappointing. but i did like it. i can't decide. ok sleepy t
