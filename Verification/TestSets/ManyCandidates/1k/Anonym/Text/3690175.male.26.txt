taking shelf.  So hard to study now since I'm so ready to leave.  till next post.
this place is an asylum for nutjobs it seems.  a house built of lies and decit. I can't wait to leave here.  I take a Pharm or MIcro shelf tommorow.  I dont feel too prepared for either exam, but I kinda hope to take the pharm exam so my final is only 35% of my grade. Feels like I'm trying to do too much right now. I can't cover everything.  I need to pick out my weaker points and concentrate on that.  Which for path (final is 45%) is GIT, Liver, Skin, ummm everything?  Pharm Drugs of Abuse Anti-Arrythmics learning the name of the drug names everything  I need to put a little more effort into micro too though.  Its about 37% of my grade.  Same in ICM.  Not enough time, never enough time.
Its monday morning now (nearly 1 am) just finished going some micro with a friend.  Looks like that 1 tropical storm went under us again...We got some intermitent heavy rain for awhile, but nothing bad at all.  Worst is just the brown water again. Seems like the scarry situation is going NW and then will be moving to the north!  Its like 800 miles from us, but is already a grade II? hurricane.... OUCH  Debating if I should put some time in for a possible pharm or micro shelf on wednesday.  I can bomb the micro shelf and still come out with an A in the course easily.  I'm pretty much locked into passing the course.  I hope I get the pharm shelf,  it'll make the final only 35%.  I don't remember very much about my antimicrobials though.  Some, but not as much, about the cholinergics and adrenergics (but thats more physio than anything).   Just remembering the drugs names n such again with which receptors they act upon.  Rest of the pharm I'm reviewing in some fashion or form for my local final anyways (cept the antimalignants which I'm only doing part of).  Looks like I am now living at the airport villas,  urlLink http://www.airportvillas.com  not as nice as the other place, but it will work out better for my semester there.  Since I have to buddy with a clinical rotation partner and have a physical exam partner.  So we'll both live there together.  then when he leaves in mid november, I'll just take over the place and stay there through Jan or a bit longer I think.   Not sure what else is new.  Still waiting for my ICM practical exam grades (tommorow!)  can't wait to get home at this point.  Feeling a bit home sick, just tired of the bullshit associated with this school.  Need time away from everything, the people, the rumors, the food, the life, etc.  On a sadder note,  a guy i knew from SA (friendly with him, but not neccessarily a friend per se), was killed saturday morning by some driver.  I think he was 22 or 23.  Just makes you think about shit.  Thats it for n
