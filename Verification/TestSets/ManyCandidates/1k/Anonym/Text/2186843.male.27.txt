to get a rainout for the next day is a classic. And there are times during the baseball season that everyone wishes they'd really do that so you can get a day off. Costner's great in this one too, just as he is in... 3.  Field of Dreams - If you build it, maybe Kevin Costner could just make sports movies for the rest of his career. Another great movie, which is all about baseball fantasy until the end, when you realized what you've just seen is really about fathers and sons. Again, when he gets to see his dad as a young man and asks him if he wants to have a catch... wow, talk about misty. Is there anything that will choke a guy up faster than a tender moment between father and son at the end of a sports movie?  2.  Raging Bull - I can't believe I've never seen this movie. You're talking about the Big Three from one of my favorite movies, "Goodfellas" in DeNiro, Pesci and Scorsese. That puts it in the top ten even without seeing it. I may have to go rent this one just out of general principle.  1.  Hoosiers - A fine choice for number one, as Gene Hackman turns a group of farm boys into the Indiana State High School Champions. Another great underdog story. When Hackman takes them into the huge gym and has them measure the height of the rim to show them that the court's the same size as their gym back in Hickory, it's quite possibly the best movie coaching moment ever. I still get chills at the end, even though I've seen this movie a million times. That's a great movie, when your reaction at the end the 50th time you see it is the same as the first time.  So there's ESPN's list. My Top 10 probably looks something like this...  Bull Durham, Caddyshack, Field Of Dreams, Hoosiers, The Natural, Major League, Tin Cup, The Rookie, Rudy, and Raging Bull. Honorable mention goes to Slap Shot, which is one of my all-time favorite movies, although it doesn't fit into the last 25 years, which was the criteria. Goes right up there with Bull Durham and Caddyshack.
Yes, I'm still alive.  Yes, I haven't updated this thing in a month.  What can I say, I've been a little busy.  We're almost three weeks into the baseball season, and as usual, it's been both fun and tiring.  We haven't even had a long roadtrip yet.  I've also moved into my new place, out of the city and into the peaceful tax-free countryside of New Hampshire.  So those are the two things that have taken up most of my time.  By the way, if you ever have to move, just burn everything you own and replace it when you get to the new place.  Take it from someone who moves way too often... It's gotta be better than actually moving everything.  I didn't even bring most of my furniture and it still was a pain in the a
