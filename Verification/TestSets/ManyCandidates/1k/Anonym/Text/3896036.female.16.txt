leeds :)!  Went to the opening of my cousin's hair salon today. Nice design he has for the shop, very zen! So got to catch up with my cousins today during the opening. Being in such a big family, its hard to talk to all my relatives.. so gatherings are always very good time to catch up! So, because of this, i missed going out to sentosa with my ti tu tiu friends (ac camp ppl). But i guess, you cant have the best of   both   worlds!
Was suppose to be a fun day going to meet my friends for dinner and to meet two other friends to play pool before that. But....like   always  , the dinner got cancelled - dont make me say why.  Then i started to feel giddy and had a bad stomachache, so i couldnt meet my 2 other friends for pool. So sorry, didnt want it to be that way too. And i stayed at home the  whoooooollllleeeee  day.  So what was suppose to be a fun day, turned out horrible. period.
Finished my 2nd, which is also my last term test paper today - travel geography. For not studying from chapter 4 onwards, i think it was quite good, 42/50. *grins* I did the "eini-mini-more" method for a couple of questions, and it worked for some questions! Most answers came from my travelling experiences, esp all those questions on Australia and America!   Im glad that the term tests have all ended. BUT, im still stuck with all my projects, another project discussion tmr.... dang..
I haven't been blogging for a while.. no mood. haha  Got jay chou's new album yesterday - qi li xiang. This time around, he went for a russian style. After econs paper yesterday, i went with christine, crystal, boon and kelly to get the CD. So happy! Waited one year for it!  But.. it isnt as good as I expected. Maybe my expectations are too high? hee. But ya.. kind of disappointed. The album has less R&B, less songs which style are like dui bu qi (fantasy) and tong yi zhong diao diao (ye hui mei). Some songs are so similar to his other songs.. the 1st song, wo de di pan, reminds me so much of san nian er ban (yhm) and jiang jun is so much like the song he wrote for jolin, hai dao. His ballads in qlx are just so-so, they are far from the standard of An Jing, Kai Bu Liao Kou, Long Juan Feng and Hui Dao Guo Qu. Interestingly, Vivian Hsu didnt write any lyrics for this album of his... Lyrics were mainly from vincent fang (duh!), and geng hong wrote one for Jay too.  I like Qi Li Xiang (track 2) though, sounds unique and has a style of its own. Yuan You Hui (track 9) also sounds great, very "bright", "fresh" and "cheerful". Track 10 seems to be the only rap song i like so far, hope the more i listen to qlx, the more I'll enjoy it.  Fantasy is still my favourite album ^
