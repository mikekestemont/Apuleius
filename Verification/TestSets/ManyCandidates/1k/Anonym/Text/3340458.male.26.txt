work and see the mess that was left for me to sort out.  I wonder if Ben took care of things as well as I anticipated he would.  He's quite disgruntled lately so it's a crap shoot.  On a side note, Canada Day was really fun.  Due to the unpredictable weather that day, we decided to head up to my parents' place in Kemptville and celebrate with the family.  My dad bought 500$ worth of fireworks so it was worth the trip just to see if he'd come close to blowing himself up like last year.  Beware the duds, dad! LOL!!!  I went four wheeling with my brother, jesus that kid is nuts.  90 km/h on a four wheeler isn't the safest feeling in the world.  I did my best to follow him and not look like a wuss but that speed with nothing between you and the road but air isn't fun. I've got a really bad urge to go buy one now.  Jen rode one of them too so I think she's hoping I decide to.  We'll see, maybe next summer.
Oh my god!  I just tried one of those new orange flavored milkshakes from McDonald's.  It's like having 6 creamsicles at once!  These are going to be hard to stay away from, especialy since there's a McDonald's about 200 yards from my place.  Funny story....  On Friday I had to go to Steve's Music on Rideau to pick up some new guitar strings.  Jen had the car and taking a bus from my place is a pain.  I decided to bike because it wouldn't take more than 15 minutes to get there.  As I was coming up to the Alexandria bridge (the steel grate one beside the museum of civilization) I was going at a pretty good clip coming up to the intersection.  As I got closer I realized that I had to jump an 8 inch high curb to get on the bike/walking path on the bridge.  "No problem" I think to myself, my bike has dual shocks in the front and back.  I don't know what the hell I was thinking.  So I end up trying to jump the curb coming at an angle.  The front tire cleared no problem but because of the angle the back tire caught the curb and threw the back end of the bike left.  I "gracefuly" skidded the bike through the bushes (without falling! I RULE) and about 20 people in the immediate vicinity had a pretty good laugh.  So I brush off my bruised ego and keep going.  Some drunk bum was sitting on the sidewalk and says to me, "F*ck dude, that was like a movie stunt" LOL!!! I burst out laughing because I realized it must have looked quite spectacular what with the speed I was going at.  The bad part is I COMPLETELY F*cked my back rim and i'll have to buy a new one.  The rest of the ride was quite interesting with that wobble in the rear :(  P.S.  Got my guitar strings though ;
