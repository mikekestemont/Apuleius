pounds, got a job, and her life did a complete turn around. She started getting attention from guys, began doing more things with her 'friends' along the lines of drugs and alcohol, lost control of her emotions, began getting bad grades in school, and completely changed. She lost all control of everything. Her boyfriend Adam has it all. She is like a puppet on his string. She knows that she can easily get control, but questions if she really wants it. She is happy, in some senses. Happier in some ways then she was before, in other ways depressed.   Well that is a quick little bio about my life. My name is Audrey and I am 16. I live in Kingsford, Michigan where I am a Junior at Kingsford High School. I work at Shopko where I meant my now, wonderful boyfriend Adam. He quickly became a major part of my life when he proved to be my greatest source of happiness. I live in this shit ass town with my mother, dad, and my great grandma. My real dad (I was adopted by my step-father) lives with his girlfriend in the same town. I hardly ever see him or my sister or brother. My brother, Brian, will be 19 shortly before I turn 17. My sister, Jenell, just turned 10. My father is a reformed alcoholic, but not being a drunk ass, doesn't mean he is well in life. He is a major junkie. Doing anything from pot, to heroin, to cocaine.   Well thats my family, I am sure you will hear much more about them. Now, back to me. Like I said, I am 16, soon to be 17. I have a wonderful boyfriend, who promises me we will get married. Don't say anything about us being too young, you don't know us. He is 18 and will be graduating from KHS this May. I honestly love him more than anything. He is my savior.   I love music. Some main stream, some not so main stream. These are some of my favorite bands: Saosin, Matchbook Romance, Silverstein, Liz Phair, Smile Empty Soul, American HI-FI, Blink 182, Puddle of Mudd, Dashboard Confessional, Evanescence, The Eagles, Eve 6, Fefe Dobson, Finch, H.I.M., Hoobstank, Incubus, Jack off Jill, Kelly Osbourne, Linkin Park, Natalie Imbruglia, The Verve Pipe, Nickleback, Solar Twins, Papa Roach, Plumb, The Yeah Yeah Yeahs, The Darkness, Everlast, Sheryl Crow, Taproot, Simple Plan, The Used, Filter, Limp Bizkit, The Wallflowers, and Trapt, Thursday, 3 Doors Down, No Doubt, Story of the Year, and Joss Stone. Among many others, seeing as music is one of my greatest passions.   I like writing. I haven't really written in a while. There are just too many confusing emotions going through me that I really can't identify between any of them. Creating some really fucked up shit.   Well this is all for now. My boyfriend (having a drinking problem) just called me on his cell phone from the middle of the woods. Piss drunk I may add. Ugh, now I am worried about him.   -
