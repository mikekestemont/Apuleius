HE'S CHEATING ON YOU!  And then today, find out that she kicked him out of the house and he started calling him names and that he lied when he said he wanted to marry her... ummm, are you suprised?  He's gettin the cow for free, and he outright said he is ashamed to go on dates with you... that shoulda been the clue. He's living in your house and treats you like crap... that's when it's your fault for tolerating it.  Ok, sorry.  Long rant... but women that let themselves be door mats (or on the flipside- control their entire life) RUIN men, to the point that when I'm ready for a relationship, a man is SO distorted that he's unable to see ME... he's too afraid I'm gonna be like the last one.  It's not fair to the few of us that are good women (notice I didn't say perfect... sometimes good is misconstrued with perfect) because we have to deal with the ruins to build something new... that's too much work, especially if the wreckage isn't my fault.
Doubt anyone is gonna find this... Then again, J found a blog from an unnamed former coworker of ours...  Oh well.  We're so slow at work right now.  I love my job (cough cough)... let me go back... I work in mortgage during the week to pay the bills while I work on my makeup artistry business.  I can't get real far with that until I finish (read: start) cosmetology.   With that slowness comes this blog...  I don't want to constantly go from website to website, considering we're not completely supposed to be on here... kind of the mentality of "don't let anyone see you"... this whole company is a bunch of contradiction.  BUT, they sign my paycheck, so I won't complain any further.  I'm getting SO excited about my trip on the 20th to see my mom's family.  Don't get me wrong, I'm as Southern as they come without being born here, but things are just SO different up there in New England, from the accent to the seafood (FL CANNOT COME CLOSE) to something as miniscule as the water (mountain water is the best!).  It's a comfort though, because my grandfather's people are some country, farm people bumpkins, so I fit right in.  The town my grandfather lives in is SO small.  If you mapquest his house, the result is all tan with two thin grey lines... and NOTHING ELSE!  Should figure, seeing as how he lives on 32 acres.  I'm excited to see my Aunt Chris also.  She and my uncle George are just super laid back, really cool people.  And I really look up to her because she lost 70 something pounds and has kept it off for something like 10 years now.  She and I are gonna work out together... Should be fun.  Keep me from going overboard with my grandmother's cookie recipes.  I'm out of things to say.  I'm sure I'll see something in the news or on some seedy talk show to write about s
