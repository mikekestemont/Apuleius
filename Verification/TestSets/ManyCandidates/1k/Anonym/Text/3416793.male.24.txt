community to be more communal (sharing three meals a day instead of just one etc...) and I expected there would be more people living in the community, but I was still able to gain insight into communal life.&nbsp;   And finally last Tuesday we returned to Calcutta by train.&nbsp; I don't know if it was the endless games of pinichole, the wealth of good reading, or just the air conditioning in the train car, but the 46 hours flew by and before we knew it were found ourselves back in the heat and noise of Calcutta.&nbsp; We celebrated the birthdays of both Mike (18th) and Tony (20th) by going out to Pizza Hut for dinner.&nbsp; It was really good to have pizza again and we were all suprised by the extent of the embarassment Mike and Tony had to suffer at the hands of the Pizza Hut employees once they discovered that it was their birthdays.&nbsp; And Yesterday afternoon I went to Daya Dan to see the kids.&nbsp; It was so good to see them and to have the chance to hug and kiss and just play with them.&nbsp; I feel so privileged to have the opportunity to be here.&nbsp; Thank you all for your prayer and support.&nbsp;
"Just 26 days remaining - and counting"  - At least that's one way to look at it. And lately I have found myself  longing  to be back in the US. Since returning from our trip South there have been so many volunteers at the homes here in Calcutta that it has been difficult to feel like you are not in the way - not to mention needed. But that is great for the children at Daya Dan and for the dying at Kalighat. But now I have to figure out what to do with myself :)  Lately I have been spending more time fasting, reading, praying and just waiting on God and seeking guidance from Him. This last two weeks have proven to be an ideal time for this, but I've found it difficult to remain patient. I know God has more to teach me, but I need the patience to endure.  Today we went to Titighar to visit a leper colony run by the Sisters of Charity.  It was such an amazing place.  There the lepers are cared for and provided jobs to help sustain the colony.  Most of them work looms and spinning wheels to make clothes.  Others help preparing food, gardening, or taking care of the pigs and goats.  I saw an enormous sow and a truly impressive boar as well as a very hairy male goat.  It was also a nice opportunity to see more of the countryside, although the train ride was quite crowded.  Chris and I nearly missed the train twice because we couldn't get on.  What a rush :)  Please continue to pray for the team and myself that we would  "suck the marrow"  out of these remaining four weeks, and that we would be able to remain focused here and not dream about cheeseburgers too much.  ~
