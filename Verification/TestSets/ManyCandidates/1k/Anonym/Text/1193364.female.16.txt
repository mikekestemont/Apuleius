old that was also not in the car. What are you, the single parent to do? How do you live without the one that you've loved for years? Frankly, I'm not to sure what I'd do. But rea;lly, do I need to worry about that?   So anyway....  I'm headed off to camp in Savannah at the college of Art and Design there. I'm a bit scared. I've been marveled as the best for a while at my non-artistic school...and now? Going to an art college will be hard for me. Accepting the fact that I'm not held in high esteem is very hard for me, especially when I'm taking life-drawing...with is not a good subject for me at all. Join me later this week as we finish going through the trials and tribulations of a young artist....   Such Bullshit sometimes.    Songs of the moment: "Let's get it started" - The Black Eyed Peas   "My Happy Ending" - Avril, whatever song that Robot on Robot Violence played at their last show, and "Mexican Wine" - Fountains of Wayne.   Gripe: the age thing. Still, my parents are so...odd sometimes.   And no matter what, I still love him.
Adventures in driving and love.  Yes, all it is true, one day you will be on the road with me. I drive, yes, it is true. Driving is fun. Other Drivers are not fun.  Shot conceration. Insanity.

I don' t think it's ever been hotter here and I'm like freaking sweating and it's nasty as hell. Ugh, can't it like rain or snow...or stop being summer before school starts? Speaking of school, it starts on the 9th...what a terribly hellish existance I have.  Love. I love being in love. Love, is by far the best thing in the world. I have a worderful guy, and he's just what I say, wonderful. I get all pissy during my...you know...and I just don't ever want to screw up like I did last night. I said "The M Word"..."married/marriage"...of course, in the fact that I totally screwed up a sentence made me go into utter panic an  my rambling gene kicked me in the ass. I dunno. Right now, he's in Arizona, and I'm here, risiding unhappily in the heat. At least he's dealing with the same heat. What a world.   Today, when I was driving, I saw a sparrow burtally murder and eat a butterfly. Oh...The Carnage!  GRIPE of the day: 8 days until school. Do I need another reason to be all gripe-y? MUSIC: Hm...Which three songs...?  "My Stupid Mouth" - John Mayer, "Makes No Difference" -Sum 41....Gah...I d
