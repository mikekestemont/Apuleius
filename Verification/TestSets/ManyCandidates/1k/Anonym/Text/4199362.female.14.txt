Yeah that's all I do! Nothing! I have about two weeks until highschool starts and I'm not too sure how I feel about that. Alright, alright starting highschool isn't that bad but a) I don't want to go back to school and b) well there isn't a b but mostly I don't like this idea of growing up. I dunno I want to go back to school to see my friends and all and I want something to do during the day but seriously who wants to go back to a richy rich, all girl's school with their own fucking bottled water? NOT ME that's for sure!  The all girls thing isn't as bad as you'd think, you get used to it, but it gets annoying. I mean the only thing I have that's anywhere close to a guy friend is my boyfriend. That's great and all, but I miss my guy friend's from my old school. Gah I'm just ranting now because I have absolutely nothing to do. I've done nothing for going on three weeks and I've been doing that on an off all summer. It's really starting to get annoying. I'm like completely bored! Erg well I dunno maybe I'll call someone or clean my room(yeah right) I mean my boyfriend's messing with his blog apparently, or he's playing video games or something. And Ira, if you see this sorry I LOVE YOU!!!!
Yup....it's my little blog! Heh.
Yes after almost four years of growing out my hair, I've changed it! I started with it being a boy cut and until 2:30 today it was to my boobs. It was getting pretty long. Now it's about at my chin, maybe an inch below with bangs and the whole shebang(or however you spell it)! I love it and I really hope everyone else does too! I mean most of my friends have this weird obsession with my hair so I guess we'll find out on Monday! ^
