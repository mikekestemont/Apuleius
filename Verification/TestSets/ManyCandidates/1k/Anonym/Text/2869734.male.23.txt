'other' me: Right.  Me: So what's the difference?  The 'other' me: There is no difference right now. See, mate, the only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her when SHE comes to you. But you can't do anything to make her want to come to you. In fact, you can only do stuff to make her not want to come to you.  Me: So the only difference is if I forget about her or just pretend to forget about her ?  The 'other' me: Right.  Me: Well that sucks.  The 'other' me: Yeah, it sucks.  Me: So it's like a retroactive decision, then? I mean I could, like, forget about her and then when she comes back, pretend like I just pretended to forget about her ?  The 'other' me: Right. Although probably more likely the opposite.  Me: What do you mean?  The 'other' me: I mean at first you're going to pretend to forget about her, you'll not call her, I don't know, whatever... but then eventually, you really WILL forget about her.  Me (after some thinking) : Well what if she comes back to me first?  The 'other' me: Hmmm... see, that's the thing, :D somehow they know not to come back until you really forget.  Me: That's the thing then.  The 'other' me: That's the thing.  +
Today was a sad day for electrical engineering. Four years of gruelling work at iit madras and today i failed to correctly use the 'knowledge' that I'd hoped i had 'gained'. I messed up big time. Here's what happened: I, very ambitiously make plans to connect my computer's sound card to the big stereo we have in the living room so that the collection of mp3 music can be put to good use. So I go and spend a fortune buying 35 meters of stereo cable (yes i know the signal levels would fall in such a long wire... vitto ki maa kaa), RCA female plugs and a stereo jack. Most of friday and the better part of saturday is spent in setting up the cable and convincing my dad of the the return on investment. The whole thing is finally ready and whaduyu know.. it works ! So I'm swaying to the tune of 'Nothing else matters' when i think to myself 'Lets push this thing to higher volume level'. I go and hike up the volume of the comp speaker from whose headphone port i have taken the sound output for the stero jack. All is well for a while. Suddenly, Metallica is inturrepted by a PHHssshhh-TackkKKK sound and i see smoke rising from the comp speakers. I am left with no speakers and a burnt sound card. Well done. Bravo ! BRAVO !!!!  I spend the next few hours pissed with myself, slowly realizing the mistake I'd made. I don't even have enthu to write the funda of what went wrong. Kill me please. Today is convocation day. I'm supposed to be officially become an electrical engineer for goDDDSSAke !!!!! EEEeeeaaarrgghhHHHHH !!  +
