more active in the setting off of the fireworks than simply be passive and enjoy the display. I cant decide which I like better. One thing that remains the same is definitely the smell afterwards. That brings a lot of fond memories back. Waking up, dial day, taking the traditional "oil bath" and always being late for going down and setting off a token firework. That was then and this is now and I just have to settle for the way things are now. And I point out, they ant too bad at all.
urlLink Blogger: Login   Over the weekend I went to two places. Both were worth writing about. One was Chinatown. Its interesting to see places like that where it's a settlement of one particular kind of people. In this instance for the most part, Chinese. But on the other hand, it has its two sides. I bought two dresses there. I couldn't resist. I know its probably cheesy and I know that stuff is just for the tourists but still I couldn't resist and they really did suit me. K was very happy with them and my look in them. I meant to have a small fashion show later but then at night, we both ended up just a little bit drunk on the kickass margarita that we had at bertucci's. All we could do was lapse into unconsciousness.  but Chinatown was really a cool place to explore. How do I explain a place like that.

I would have wanted to examine and explore the place some more but the rest of them were not too much in the mood for that with the multitudes of people there. But I had fun. The next day, Sunday that was, K had to work. That sucked. So I went with sushi and P to watch the gay pride parade. That was another interesting thing. Me with a bunch of proudly not-straight guys standing on the sidelines and enjoying the show. P and sushi were amused by my saying that was a waste of beautiful manhood, but I was not amused by that. I was saddened. Its a lifestyle choice that the person makes to be different. But really why do they make these choices. It interests me what motivates a person to make certain choices.  That was a good day too. I had a blast a
