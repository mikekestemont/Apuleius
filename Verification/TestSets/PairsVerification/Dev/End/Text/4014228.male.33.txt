1:30 p.m. looking to avenge a 32-13 road loss to the Rams a year ago in its season finale.  The Red Devils will also be looking for payback when they host Lakeland Sept. 23 at 4:15 p.m. in their homecoming game. Last year the two teams played with the playoffs on the line in Lakeland's homecoming game, with the Hornets winning 24-21 on a field goal with less than a minute left.  Peekskill will host a Harrison squad, which is traditionally one of the best schools in the state Oct. 2 at 1:30 p.m.  The Red Devils will then have the challenge of challenges when they cross the Tappan Zee Bridge Oct. 8 at 7:30 p.m. to play defending New York State Class A champion Nyack.  Last year, the Red Devils avoided Nyack because of the weighted schedule but since they are going back to league play, there is no avoiding the giant from Rockland County this time around.  Peekskill will finish the regular season Oct. 16 at 1:30 p.m. when it hosts Spring Valley. This is another revenge game for Peekskill as it looks to atone for an 18-0 loss on the road a season ago.  In that contest, Peekskillâ€™s defense looked great but turnovers in their own territory led to the loss.  After that, Peekskill will either play playoff games or two more regular season games if it misses the postseason.  Mike Sabini-914-582-8703-msabini@mail.com
Those of us who write like to make everyone think that we come up with some great ideas with lots of hard work.  Sometimes that's the truth but other times it's just dumb luck to be honest.  For example, I was calling Peekskill boys basketball Lou Panzanaro the other day about the opening of the Camp Inc. Learning and Resource Center. It was a good thing I called, because the press conference for the grand opening was changed.  There was another reason I was glad that I called. It's was because he told me about the Red Devil basketball camp which has been going on for 20 years now.  That was a good thing because I was wondering what I was going to write and right out of the blue, I had a great story about this camp which has been helpful to so many people.  Of course, while it's up to us writers to come up with the story ideas we always encourage people to get in contact with us. So if you have a story idea, please let me know and I will try to persue to the best of my ability.  Especially at this time of year, it helps a writer covering high school/local sports to get help wherever they can. Football teams start practicing Monday, Aug. 16 with everyone else going two days later so the ideas will be coming fast and furious to me before I know it.  Still, it can't ever hurt to get some help along the way so if you have an idea, call or e-mail me. I look forward to seeing everyone around this school year.  Mike S
