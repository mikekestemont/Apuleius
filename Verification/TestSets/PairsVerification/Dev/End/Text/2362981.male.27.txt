thought of voting Liberal this year.   "We believe that the heartless, selfish and opportunistic policies of the Howard Government have reached such levels of depravity that there can be no more important or urgent goal for any caring and concerned Australian than the resounding defeat of the Howard Government at the forthcoming federal election.

I thought it, I talked about it, people tld me about it, and finally someone is going to make a fw Australia's feel better baout it, nd others, not so good about it....  "John Howard Lies. We all know it. It's about time someone said it. So we are here at  JOHNHOWARDLIES.COM ."  urlLink    The Liar Supreme...

I've been stuck in the thought pattern burning pointless fighter fuel, reckoning every issue I spot to blog is so obvious, others will surely know about it by now, and simply don't.  I've been writing though, its just not online yet (work stuff, like the new pages on  this site ), and I've been reading (not work stuff – yeah!), and oh yeah, drinking and socialising… it feels like hard work afterwards, let me tell ya.
