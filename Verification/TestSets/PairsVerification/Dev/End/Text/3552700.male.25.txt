George W. Bush, Reagan and Lincoln brought prosperity and progress to America.  America is the leading nation of this world. If America succumbs to "liberalism", the world will soon be embroiled in this attack of the devil. The devil had tried "terrorism" but failed and it uses "liberalism" in the form of Gays rights. If the devil succeed this time, he will perpertuate with more of his "tools".... possible terrorism and wars.  God bless America!    * Disclaimer : All views and opinions voiced in this blog solely reflect that of the person who wrote it and not of any organisation or nation or group that he belongs to.
"Every nation rises and falls on its leadership. The strength of its leadership depends on who leads the Government. "  I thank God for our soon-to-be PM, BG(NS) Lee Hsien Loong, our DPM. He is a proven leader and a tough nut when he need to. People always look at his background and say he is what he is because of his father. How many failed to realized if he did not have what it takes, even with his father help he will still not make the mark. And because of his unique background, I think, this drives him to pursue excellence and make him what he is today. Surely, he does not want his family name to suffer because of him and he would have want to show that he's not a papa's boy.  Circumstances produce the leader. DPM Lee was moulded in such an environment. This gives him a nerve of steel and makes him a hard man. You can say he have his shortcoming, his temper. I prefer to say that God can turn that into a strength or rather, it had its purpose!  The world democracy had eroded and licientiousness had taken over. To stop this wave of licientiousness from affecting our nations, we need strong leaders. Leaders who go against the odds. Leaders who stand against the crowds. DPM Lee is one such leader.  This is, I believe, his moment in history. The defining moment for Singapore and DPM Lee. I'm happy because I know DPM Lee is more than capable to lead us. Strength is neccessary in face of eroding morals.
Question: What is the truest definition of Globalization?       Answer: Princess Diana's death.       Question: How come?       Answer:       An English princess with an Egyptian boyfriend crashes in a  French tunnel, driving a German car with a Dutch engine, driven by a Belgian who was drunk on Scottish whiskey, followed closely by Italian Paparazzi, on Japanese motorcycles, treated by an American doctor, using Brazilian medicines!And this is sent to you by a Malaysian, using Bill Gates'  technology.And you are probably reading this on one of the IBM clones that  use Taiwanese-made chips, and Korean-made monitors, assembled by Bangladeshi workers in a Singapore plant, transported by lorries driven by Indians, hijacked by Indonesians, unloaded by Sicilian longshoremen, trucked by Mexican illegal aliens, and finally sold back to your supplier in Malaysia who then sold it to you.       That, my friend, is G
