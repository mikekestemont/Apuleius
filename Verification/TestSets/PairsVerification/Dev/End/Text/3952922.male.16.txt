even attached the lids of the pateelas for the 'extra' effect. Drumsticks were obviously spatulas and spoons. There! The "instrument problem" was solved. *Sigh* The next issue that came up was our name. We didn't want to sound 'oh-so-sophisticated' by using some French word nor did we want to sound conceited by using our own names (erm, ali noor doesn't get to read this, does he? *blinks*) Since we are desi girls with desi minds and desi music, the name we came up with was as desi as could be. Paan ki dukaan. *Winks*After this was decided, we covered our guitar and drums with shimmering paan wrappers to give the look we wanted and at our all girls' gig that are held at our studio (aka saphiya's storeroom), every person receives the chocolate flavored paans. *Slurp* Our music is not categorised.We'll do any kind. Rock, rap, jazz, Bhangra, pop, metal, punk rock, death metal...name it, we like it. We don't really have any proper songs to our account because we don't have the resources to make them but Yeah we did something which bands like junoon took years to do*evil grin*we ripped a song.'Ripped' is an understatement. We slaughtered the lyrics, scrambled the tune and VIOLA! We had our very own song. It’s called "Tu boring ho Gaya hai", ripped from one of the Uk bhangra bands. Red-hot flaming potato isn't our only inspiration (Doesn't every band like to use that word for the bands they copy? *giggle*giggle*) we adore the commercial advertisements’ jingles too. We soon plan to make a song called "paan chahiyey.kaunsa janab?" *grins*  Frankly speaking, we know we won't ever enter the mainstream but what we want to say here is that girls are capable of almost everything. I mean, we had nothing to back us up. No sources, no support, nothing at all, if we could come up like this, then somebody who has all the resources can work miracles. And we know there are girls with support and resources but they are too shy to come out. When we started we didn't know our next door neighbor would even know we existed but thanks to online forums and orkut, we have gained a little popularity. We’re even thinking of launching a website in a couple of months (yeah! As soon as we get jobs as dj's on some fm *pouts*) what's better, Faisal Shah even volunteered to model for our 'in-our-dreams' only videos. *Jumps up and down*we might borrow some instruments from our friends and record some covers on our stuck-up computers. The proverb,'where there is a will, there’s a way’, seems to be more meaningful now ainnit? So all you sisters out there go for it if you can. The 'first paki all girls’ band' label is gone but you can strive to be the second *wink*wink*.And if any parent reads this (which I seriously doubt), please don't underestimate your daughters and back them up like you would do for your sons. It’s the 21st century! HELLO! Cheers By : Saphiya Khan(aka the s
