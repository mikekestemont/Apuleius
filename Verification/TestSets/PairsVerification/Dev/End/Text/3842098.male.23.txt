right now.  I just finished reading the chapter about Jeremiah in  The Book of God .  The story of his life astounds me.  When I look at who he was, I see a man of true faith.  His prophesied about the exile of Judah and the destruction of Jerusalem.  Throughout the story of his life, you can see him being pulled in two different directions, tormented by the coming destruction of the people and city he loved, but commissioned by God to speak his word.  To read about how he cried out to the Lord about torment that he withstood, but through all of the pain he undertook, he was faithful to God and God was faithful to Jeremiah.  To me, that is a beautiful picture of faith and trust in God.
I really want to post something more substantial or more uplifting, but I haven't been able to think of anything.  So I will settle with some thoughts on work right now.  I'm going through another one of those cycles in which I'm really down on work.  This time I'm not sure if I can chalk it up to my own attitude.  I think the problem is that I feel like I am wasting my time.  My job is really easy.  There is no need to engage my mind in what I'm doing.  Most of what I do can be done without really thinking about it.  Seriously, how much thought does it take to look at two different reports and compare numbers to make sure they match?  It tests your memory to remember all of the little details that need to be taken care of day by day.  Basically, once you get into a routine, there is no real need to think at all.  Therein lies the problem, I would like to have a job that causes me to think and challenges me everyday.  I want my mind to be stimulated.  To use an economic term, I am underemployed.  My skills are not being used to a point that I would like them to be.   I also realize that part of the problem could be an adjustment to the working world.  I spent the last 4 years before this getting massive breaks during the year.  Because Otterbein is on quarters, we always got six weeks for Christmas break (Thanksgiving through the first of the year) and from the middle of June until the middle of September off for the summer.  I haven't taken much time off since the beginning of the year.  Granted, I took a week off for LT, but I don't count that.  LT was amazing and I am so glad I went, but it didn't allow much time for myself.  I think what I need to do is take at least a few days off soon, but that can't happen until late August or September.  Probably one of the best things I could do right now is spend some time away from work.   Well, I can leave work now.  So that is what I am going to d
