I said, Matt left my girlfriend Jennipher and I to deal with the movers and I'm not sure I am ever going to forgive him.&nbsp; Herb kept telling us to smile, be happy, it was weird.&nbsp; I just wanted to get moved.&nbsp; Its not that I was trying to be rude, but we paid him for a service and talking was not it.&nbsp; He moved our things, but he just kept on talking to us while he was doing it.&nbsp; I felt like telling him, “less talk, more moving.”&nbsp; They left an hour ahead of Chris, Jennipher, and I, arrived an hour after us, and Herb went back to talking rather than moving.&nbsp; Chris actually helped unload the truck so they would leave.&nbsp; Jennipher and I were completely creped out by this guy.&nbsp; The word predator came to mind, not just mine but also Jennipher’s.   When the mover left, it was just Matt, Chris, Jennipher, and I, with a lot of boxes.&nbsp; There were so man boxes we could barely move around them.&nbsp; I think there was a total of 60 boxes total, plus a few crates, and all of our furniture.&nbsp; We went out to dinner, leaving the boxes for another time.&nbsp; Dinner was okay; we ate at a Mexican restaurant in Hico.&nbsp; I would normally recommend this place highly, but the food just seemed to be tasteless this particular night.&nbsp; Oh well, so much for having a good meal and to top it off the margaritas were very strong, too strong!&nbsp;   Chris and Jennipher left around 10:30 pm and I went to bed.&nbsp; The next morning I was up unpacking bright and early.&nbsp; I finally got nearly everything unpacked by the following Monday.&nbsp; A box lingered here and there –still lingers here and there- but for the most part we got everything done!&nbsp; Alleluia! I think I already mentioned that we went to Waco again last Friday, July 16th.&nbsp; We finished packing everything up and between our little Sunfire and Jennipher’s Rodeo we managed to get everything here…almost.&nbsp; Chris and Jennipher still have a few things sitting around their apartment that belong to us for the next time we go to Waco, but other than that we are done, finished, fini, finito!   I am still trying to find a place for the never-ending clutter, wish me luck, but for the most part everything is done.&nbsp; Matt’s dad is coming up on Thursday to see up, yippee.&nbsp; All things considered this has been the best move Matt and I have ever had.&nbsp; That’s saying a LOT for us.&nbsp; We tend to have terrible moves, possibly the worst ever.&nbsp; Still, with the movers moving all of our furniture and the majority of our boxes of stuff, we still had a lot to do.&nbsp; The apartment was not left as clean as I would have like it to be but hey, that’s life right?   I have to say that without Jennipher and Chris, this move would have been far more of a nightmare!&nbsp; Thanks guys, from the bottom of my heart!&nbsp;   ~
