study in university. We going to have a farewell party for her in Secret Recipe on this Sunday. Goodbye Jasmine, *sob sob*...  There's a Canteen's day in my school next week. And we are forced to order the food from the school. Since I step in to the school, I never eat anything from the canteen. I'm not anti the canteen actually, just too lazy to walk all the way from my classroom to the canteen and squeeze with the students. I prefer stand outside my class and eat my bread with my friends. Now, that's what we call as 'anti-social'. Oh, and I found these two site  urlLink anti-social dot net  and  urlLink anti-social dot org . Waiting for them to update their sites.

Log in to the chatroom, cuz I feel like want to voice out something, but then, I was totally speechless. For the first time, I'm emotionless.  I feel blue in this sunny day, when everything outside is bright and I'm blue inside. Somewhere deep down my heart know that I'm not that happy in these few days, but I don't know why?

Happy birthday to Teo!   Happy Sweet 18th!
Busy.
That's Kah Boon and I. We both actually look like twins. This picture was taken few years ago in Tanjung Tuan when we went for Raptor Watch. But right now my size is much bigger than the picture. And thanks to Mei Shan for scanning the picture for me.  And, I miss you, Tomoko! : )
