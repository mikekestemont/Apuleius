even buy school clothes... which is dilemma one. Dilemma two, would be that in our eyes, we have done nothing this summer. i have pretty much sat around, watched tv, sat on the computer, worked a little bit, taken a college astronomy class, taken an alg. class, mowed the lawn a couple times, tanned, saw my mom for a month, and....saw my boyfriend. woo. thats not much to me, so im very disappointed, see this is my   last summer before my senior yr, then next summer i have to prepare for college   . so, i feel old, and unaccomplished.       2 weeks....what can a person do in two weeks to make themselves feel accomplished? well, what do i think i need to accomplish before school starts? i think i need to buy my school clothes, but i can't do that unless i work my ass off uber bad in the next two weeks! so cross that off. do something exciting? well, trapt is playin at a state fair in sioux falls on aug. 8th....but i doubt me and brooke could go there for it, although it'd be really fuckin awesome.      maybe its all psychological...seeing, now that i read all that, it doesn't seem like those really make a person more accomplished. they sound materialistic. i guess i need to get over it, b/c other kids have wasted there summers on even less things then i have around here...      well, good post brittany!! ((clap clap)) horray, im expressing my feelings... i feel allot better.
Noooo, not a pop vinyl record- silly!      well, i know i already posted today. but i figured that i would do an explanation for the blog's name. seeing it may come off as unusual, and may spark your interest, as of why i chose it. right? lol yah.      well, its the name of a scent, of a perfume, by Chupa Chups. Its Chupa Chups I Love Me in Pop Vinyl.   it smells sooo good. and i got it last summer, but i can't find it anywhere right now, except for on two foreign perfume websites.  urlLink  www.douglas.de   &amp;  urlLink  www.beautyfive.com  .       but anyways, thats enough of my problems....  urlLink  now heres a look of the actual bottle  !   it even looks awesome, huh? lol.
welcome back to blogger, brittany.     this is my first blog since... like two years ago. which i am now 17. i used to be addicted to the internet, having little silly websites on expage. trying my hardest to make a creative and attractive site with random uploading sites.      so, needless to say, those were very short lived and pieces of crap with cute colored css codes.   now, i will have a blog... again for free, lol... but this will just be for a journal of some sort, seeing i don't write in my tanglible one, and i need to express myself otherwise my head gets too full of feelings and i  don't  function well in life :)      lets see, what else to say...not much, tomorrow will be my first blog entry, so the internet better brace i
