Claire, the english chick Amy kept telling me about, but didn't get to talk to her very much. She's cute but unfortunately that situation with the other girl has gotten a little more difficult in that the other girl's come to the decision that she does want to make a go of it. So I guess that's strike two for me this year, ouch!  After the game I tagged along with Amy, Alex, Amy's sister, and sister's fianc√©e Jazz, for take-out from East Side Mario's. Jazz even bought me a beer while we waited for our food. Just as he was returning from the bar with the beer the waitress arrived with the food. There was only one thing we could do - down the beer as fast as possible. We then went to Amy and Alex's where we watched some home video of the wedding proposal and laughed at Amy's father's reaction which was to yell out the Clan's war cry.  The next day I had to wake up at the ungodly hour of 6:00am. Dan rented a car this past weekend to go up for Montreal's pride parade, and he was kind enough to offer me a ride as well but instead I asked him to drop me off in Long Sault to go surprise my mom and visit for the day. Turned out it was a good decision since I woke up that morning feeling awful. As soon as I arrived (and after reassuring her nothing was wrong), she had me on the couch with a pillow and a cup of tea. Luckily, it wasn't long before I felt a bit better and we walked around, saw how her flowers were doing, and had a couple glasses of wine. I also wanted her reassurance on the decision I'd come to that I was going to start apartment hunting this week. She agreed that it would be a good idea and even said she'd take a day off and join me if I could arrange the viewings all on the same day, which is great.  Today I ended up shopping with Dan since he had the car for another day. Some drinking glasses and a new Adidas shirt were purchased (I ruined my other one due to an unfortunate laundry mutilation). We also went to Le Chateau so he could buy some pants and a couple shirts. I haven't been in one of those stores for so long, it felt very strange. All the girl's clothes are so girly to the tenth power (shudder). We were supposed to go to Costco and Loblaw's for groceries but this part of the plan fell through as they were both closed, so we dropped the car off and called it a day. Other than that, I went for tea with Heather and got caught up on all her adventures and now I'm waiting for a call from Amy and Alex on whether they're interested in going for a blizzard later, mmmm brownie blizzard. You know you want one.   You still want o
