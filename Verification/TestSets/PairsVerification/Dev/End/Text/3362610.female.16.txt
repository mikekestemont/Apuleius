Comedy Tour with my dad. We sat in the fourth row and got all of their autographs. It was freaking awesome! Ok so on Saturday, I hung out with Lindsey and Chelsea. I'm pretty sure we just sat at Denver West for a long time. Sunday, I went and saw Larry the Cable Guy with my dad. Later that night, I met up with Amber, Iris and Lindsey and spent the night at Amber's house. I came home the next day and went fridge shopping with my dad. We finally bought one and then went to lunch. I went shopping with Amber and Iris at Victoria's Secret and Abercrombie & Fitch. Monday night, Iris, Danielle and I went to dinner with my mom at the California Pizza Kitchen and then rented movies and watched em at my house. We watched the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and EuroTrip. The ladies spent the night and Iris and I played at the school the next day. We met up with Amber and went out for ice cream and then to the river for a bit. We decided to go to Iris' barn so we did and I went horseback riding for my first time ever! It was soo much fun. That night, we hung out with a bunch of people at D West for awhile and then went and saw Napolean Dynamite. I swear we laughed through like the whole thing. Once again, the ladies spent the night and had to leave early the next day. I went to the Rockies game with my mom and Etta that night. It was ok except for the fact they suck and it's impossible to win a game. On Thursday, I hung out with Cisco and Christian for just a bit. It really wasn't that much fun so I just came home. I found out on Friday that I didn't get a parking pass this year. Very, very depressing. I hung out with Linds and Chels that night and we did all sorts of fun things. We hung at D West for awhile with Brandi and then we went to a party with Lauren A, Lisa G, Matt B and Ben H. It was kinda creepy so me, Linds, Chels, Matt and Ben just went to Lindsey's and watched FearDotCom. Weird freakin movie. I still don't get it. It actually kinda sucks cuz I think I kinda have a slight crush on Ben now. But it's just a little one I swear. Today, I went horseback riding with Linds and Chels all day at Bear Creek Lake Park. They came over for dinner and then we were tryin to find somethin to do. We ended up at the mall for awhile and then went up to Andrew's. We hung out at Brooke's for a bit with some of the fellas, but it was nothing very exciting. But anyways there are tons of things to write down....mainly about some boys, but I will just write more tomorrow cuz I am tired and Brenden wants to talk. So laters! ~
