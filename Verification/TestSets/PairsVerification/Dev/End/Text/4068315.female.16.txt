it was just my dad and I eating dinner together. I remember asking him if he was taking off work the next day, or if he was going back. He said he was going to the hospital the next morning, so he could take care of some things with his dad, and he wouldn't be going to work. We didn't say anything else to eache other, and I remember seeing my dad's eyes tear up.  This was the first time I had ever seen my father cry. And sitting there at the dinner table, was the first time I've had my heartbroken.  The sharpest pain is losing your parents. Back in those weeks and months after my Grandpa passed away, I remember being so afraid for my own parents. I couldn't imagine losing them, and I knew if I did, I couldn't go on myself. My parents are my core. Sometimes I stop at times like this, when I'm by myself and reminded of someone I knew who died, I can't help but think I want to pause everything as it is.

I remember her exact words, when she looked at me and whispered, "Oh Lauren, but it  really does  happen like that when you fall in love, everything else slowed down when I met my husband."  A little piece of my heart cracked off for Mrs. Benda.  So at this point in my jogging, I had made a mental list, of  the three people I would bring back now if I could.  Karrie's father Stacies twin, Tracy My Grandpa  And that's really where it ends. I'm not waiting for the time when I lose someone so near to me, my heart is burried with them. I want to kick myself in the shins, for never giving tighter hugs,  holding longer conversations, and smiling more. I need to work on my a
