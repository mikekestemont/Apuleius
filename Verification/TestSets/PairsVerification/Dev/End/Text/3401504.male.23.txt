be a little apprehensive before going to somewhere like Afghanistan.  It takes a lot of courage to do what she's doing, and I'm proud of her for that.  Funny part is she's officially based in Pakistan!  So my parents continued their semi-hostile takeover of my Brooklyn apartment.  Since my dad opened up his new office, he keeps planning on staying here at my place.  That means for the next week, if we all stay here, I get the privelege of sleeping on the air-mattress in the non-airconditioned living room.  So I picked up my mom from work and brought her over before heading out to have dinner with Rahim and Noureen.   They called later saying they didn't feel like staying, so I get to sleep in my room tonight.  The nice thing is that my mom cleaned up my dirty apartment.  I remember while I was in London, I cleaned my place thoroughly before my mom and sis came to visit.  When they arrived, their first reaction was, "How could you live in such a dirty apartment," and managed to clean it properly.  It was like that today... I always thought my apartment was relatively clean.   Tonight I had dinner with Rahim and Noureen at their place.  They're such awsome people to talk to.   They now live on the upper east side, a pretty fun neighborhood.  Fun night, great conversations.  I'm gonna miss having nights like tonight.   Until next time.
Summer is almost over.  This was my first actual summer vacation in 2 years.   That was probably the hardest thing to get used to after graduation, the lack of long drawn out holidays.  Luckily, I quit my job at the end of May and enjoyed the time off.  Al Ummah was terriffic, and quite honestly, being idle at home wasn't all that bad either.  I complained about the boredom, but when else in my life before retirement will I have the chance to be this lazy?   So this weekend was fairly good.  My sister came down from Boston (as usual, because having lived on Summer in Boston, I know how much that city can suck).  It was good.   I finally got things normalized with her.  I was angry for some reason since getting back.  I guess it was a bit of a shock, my family being in a different routine since the beginning of summer.  All that unfamiliarity all at once was a bit weird, and I took it out unnecessarily on my folks.  Luckily I'm realizing this now instead of being pissed off for the remainder of the time I'm here.   Earlier this week I went with Joyce to see an off-off-Broadway show called 'Hoover.'  It was in a tiny theater off of St. Mark's Pl.  Really funny show about the former FBI director and his cross-dressing / abuse of power.  Ironically it was very pertinent to today's situation with the whole terrorism thing.  The cast was only about 6 people playing multiple roles, but pretty damn funny.   Hopefully I'll be able to hit up the beach tomorrow.  Pending no r
