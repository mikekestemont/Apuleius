urlLink    The Beautiful Nicole Kidman in Cold Moutain
urlLink    The Butterfly Effect
Hey guys,  I caught a couple of movies this weekend. The first was  Cold Mountain  starring Nicole Kidman, Renee Zellweger, and Jude Law. It was a very intresting movie the struggle of one man to get back to his one true love who he hardly knows. The DVD  is a 2 disc set collection. The picture and sound are amazing on this disc. Cold Moutain is pretty long clocking in at 2 hours and 38mins but it is worth a rent. Very odd at times but worth it.   Next up was a nice supries  The Butterfly Effect  starring Ashton Kutcher and Amy Smart. I highly recommend this movie it is Fantastic and a must see! The DVD comes with the Directors Cut which is the feature you must watch first. If you wish you can watch the Theatrical cut after. The disc is beautiful with excellent sound. Don't miss out!

urlLink    I just finished watching this great flick. I really enjoyed it, at first I just wanted to watch it for Jennifer Garner ( I just love Alias). I thought no way this movie was going to be good, it would be just a cheap rip off of Big starring Tom Hanks. Well was I wrong.   13 going on 30  is a highly enjoyable and funny movie that touches the heart. Do not miss out on this instant classic, and of course you will discover that Jennifer Garner is more than just some Spy she is a huge star on the rise. Thanks for the laughs and tears.

I just finished watching the whole  Hellboy  dvd.  What an awesome movie and a great disc.  If you want a really cool superhero movie I highly recommend  Hellboy .  The dvd set is 2 discs with an amazing 2 1/2 hour behind the scenes documentry, and a fun commentary track with the cast.  So go out there and pick it up or Hellboy will hunt you down and put you down.       urlLink       Hellboy D
