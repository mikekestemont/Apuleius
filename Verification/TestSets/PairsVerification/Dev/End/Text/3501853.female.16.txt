had to grow up too early, even b4 high school, and wether we liked it or not, we faced a hard time in our life and Louie: god you'll never be forgotten. I'll never forget after an assembly in Chippewa you sppinning me around saying "Who's your best friend Camille" and so many other memories..I love you. While we were there, this white Honda pulled up to the Gas Station and parked there and just fucking stared at us. It was really scary but luckily Jorge came just in time. His car is nice, you're lucky Ana (lol). Ana walked me to my car so the white car wouldn't follow me and she got so scared for me, she made me write Jorge's cell # down to call her in case they were following me cuz her cell was dead! That was soo sweet and loving of her   After my little trip with Ana, I went back home then went to church with mom and Tim. We got home and Mik called right away crying :'( I told her to come over right away and she was explaining to me her fight with her dad. It was horrible I offered her all of my Kleenex and hugs. It was hard I didn't wanna intrude cuz Mike (her dad) is my neighbor but Mik's such a great girl and is a friend so of course I knew even tho he was my neighbor, Mik came first and I wanted to take her from her pain and I really did try but Mike wouldn't let her go anywhere. We were gonna go to the Elk Grove fireshows but he wouldn't let her. I wanted her to just spend the night but he wouldn't let her. My mom, Tim, and I ended up going to a Mount Prospect carnival to watch **fireworks** but she couldn't come and I was bummed out cuz I knew she was so sad but nonetheless, the fireworks were amazing. They were so big and pretty, even when they fall down, they're still pretty, I liked them a lot. Mik: I hope you feel better, I'm here for you just one house away. I wanted to call Kev tonight after the fireworks show to catch up and what not but it was too late when I got home so I still miss him. Tomorrow, I'm working out at RecPlexx in the morning (cuz I got super fat from eating non-stop my grandparents "philipino" food (lol)) then I'm painting (Lolo (my grandpa) got me so many new brushes, a bunch of little 5x7 canvas and lots of paint so that was fucking great) and I'm starting my first painting tomorrow. After that, who knows, I can't predict the future so I'm just gonna take a shower at 1 in the morning and go to sleep with my t.v. blasting..that right there, is independence haha, happy fireworks day   "...I tried not to hurt you but I did...Is that why they say...Every rose has its thorn, every cowboy sings a sad sad s
