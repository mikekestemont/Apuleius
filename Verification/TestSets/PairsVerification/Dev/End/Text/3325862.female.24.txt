hey! When i finally got home, and saw the damage the sewage had created on our street i was shocked, heck im still in shock, i think the whole hosehold is still in shock. I lived in the basement along with Paul, my mom and dad.  we lost pretty much everything except our cloths and the stuff that was above 2 feet. when i walked down stairs i was awwed that we had lost so much. its like nothing you could imagine. but we could do absoluty nothing for ourselves. we had sub floors and we still had sewage in our basement but we couldn't deal with it until the adjusters came. So we helped out our neighbors the best we could. we had a shop vac from the inlaws we were using and another neighbors and mom and i went around and shop vac'd out other houses.  My sisters boyfriend also had a sound studio down ther too, and he lost all the equipment that was on the ground, and all the wires attached to the equipment that wasn't on the ground.  The insurance adjuster came i think saturday afternoon to see what kind of damage we had from the sewage.they took photos, and assesed the basement. then they said that they knew of a different emergency clean up crew other then the one we would have gotten. We got a phone call just after 6, it was First General Services, emergency response crew, and they were going to be right over. Now these people had driven from Sudbury to help out the crews here in peterborough. They were at our house before 6:30 and didn't leave until after 9:00 that night. they tore apart our basement for the next 2 and a half days.  Yes thats how much stuff we had!! My mom was in a state of complete shock, she didn't know were to start the clean up, but thanks to Anne-Marie and frankie, and here crew, we didn't have to pull anything out of our basement ourselves. The next morning we started going through the stuff that was to be thrown out because of contamination. Every thing that we couldn't keep that meant something to us we had to catologue. I took almost a full week for us to do that, not to mention the large 30' by 10' by 9' bin we had, that we filled three times. sub floors and everything! We are so greatful for the team we had from Sudbury we would have never gotten through what we did as quick or as organized with out them!  So the clean up is complete in our basement mostly everything that needed to be torn out has been, except some sub floor that still needs to go thats under some walls. Mom and i are just about finished all the cataloguing of everything weve lost, as well as our spouses. All thats left now is to file the claim and wait for construction to begine then we can go on a spending spree of s
