maybe college has more in store for me than just learning and meeting new people and gaining a theatre portfolio
wow ive been busy. Nothing but work work work all the time. Man the only nights im free at home are tuesday and mondays, go figure. THeres nothing to do on my nights off except... well theres nothing to do. Id rather be at the theatre working, i consider that type of stuff a blast. well ill write again soon like late at night and my creativeness is flowing ill write poetry or something
WOW!! two weeks till im 18 and i move into college that weekend, what a blast itll be. Though i do intend to leave a few instructions to my friends who are still in high school, mainly who they need to take care of for me since im gone. I will truly miss all of them, though i havnt tried to keep in touch with that many of my friends that have gone off to college, only a select few. They all have a place in my life where they have influenced me in thought word and deed, Im not the wisest in the world or even claim to have much wisdom but i hope they will come to me and talk if they have anything they need to talk about. My door is always open and my mind works like and open parachute,(the best way a parachute works is by being open) To anyone who knows me and might say that i show no emotion, its only because when i was little i always tried never to cry because my parents were divorced and as a result it takes more than a miraculous thing to stir tears within me. Here are some tips for anyone to live a happy life. Never be afraid of a tear because they need to be shed and it feels good to shed them (from what i can remember) Whether out of sorrow because of hardships or because of joy from an awe inspiring film or performance. Laughter is the best medicine and i know this for a fact, it spreads joy though the body even if only for the time you are laughing. Take a deep breath whenever life seems to pound at your being, know that life was given as a gift and you can only know happiness if there is sorrow to compare it to. Always remember tomorrow is but a day away.  And the last thing i say is often the hardest because it has the potential for the biggest hurt, Have an open heart. Yes its true if you close it off you wont be hurt AS easy but then again for all the hurt of an open heart, It is only magnified tenfold when a little joy is let in with people who you truly care about and who truly care about you.
