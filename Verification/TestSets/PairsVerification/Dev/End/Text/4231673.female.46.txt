Tim Wells conversion may have started him thinking. (Tim and Andrew were last at Carey together 5 years ago.)  Well, time to finish - I have to be up at 5.45am to pick up Andrew from his night-shift at Festive Productions. He's making tinsel for Â£6.00 an hour. He comes home with his pockets full of tiny bits of the stuff which end up all over the house - it's like Christmas without the fun bit.
Having just had a peek at Careyteens I feel a bit like a voyeur! "Seeing" teenagers speak is weird, after all they mostly grunt at home and never express personal feelings, so seeing them confessing their deepest, darkest longings is sooo strange.     I must admit that I tend to get PCF (post-Carey Frustration) as we return to a diet of 18th and 19th century hymnody. If I want to taste the music of the earlier part of the 20th century we have to turn up 20 minutes before the service for a time of chorus singing.  I also get PCR ( post-Carey Resolutionitis ) when I make firm decisions to be able to play the drums, electric and/or bass guitar, recorder, piano, etc, etc to at least grade 6 by next Carey.Once again Carey (FC) came and went...the coming took oh such a long time the "went" confirmed it as the fastest week of the year (moan).  The ministry, music and meeting of folk was awesome (to pinch a teenage expression), and I still think on AK's preaching on Ps 2 which did result in that overwhelming sense of the presence of God which kept us fixed to our seats and silenced. Ann and Cora were also fantastic - practical and wise. It gave us ladies a chance to share problems and ask questions.  As usual the Carey Concert proved to be a hotbed of talent - oh, our young, young people! What with Jacob, Lauren, Georgina, Robert.....teens watch out the talent is closing fast! Tom K as Peter Cook sounded just like his dad! There was a good balance of music this year - it wasn't dominated by any one particular style or family!  Fellowship with folk was excellent. How good it is for brothers (and sisters) to dwell together! What more reason to look forward to next year's Carey, it's biblical! To catch up with people's news and to see answers to prayer from the previous years CFC.... Pat and John and their new son Aaron, Andrew and Sarah and their new daughter Bethany, God is good, and we played a part in our prayer support! Amazing! The ladies time of prayer was good too - a first for CFC since I've been involved - it was an opportunity to bring those more personal things to the Lord. We will continue to remember Debbie, Susan, Emma and Giselle before Him.  Well this ends my first entry. Haven't got a clue what I'm doing really, just feeling my way. Apologies to Larry Norman for messing with his song title as the title for this p
