film making. I'm going to do fairly well next year so I can grab a good spot in Highschool.   Jon of KP fame is really a) funny, and b) nice. Everyone including Goldy liked my flyer, which isn't too bad if I may say so...myself.   And Mike Boehner has gotten mad at me today. For some reason, someone has been telling him lies. LIES, I say. Anyways, he thought I called him annoying and a 'poser skater'. What the dickens? I called him annoying when Sammy and I were really mad at him like 2 months ago, but i never called him a 'poser skater'. Who calls people that? It just sounds dumb. And like he said, he doesn't skate. So we worked it out, and we're all cool now.   If I can, i'll put the flyer up here once i can scan it. Later, hater.
So, band i sort of do alot for, Wyatt Reloads, has decided to order up some pins. The 2 designs they've made are a gritty, black and white picture of esther doing an ollie (?!), with red letters Wyatt Reloads. The other is a black and white picture of me and "Wyatt Reloads...Will eat your babies."   Super Cute! Still, my face on a pin is nothing to complain about. Now I have to design one for Sidekick...I was thinking one of those red and white japenese 'Rising Suns', ala kamikaze, with 'Sidekick' then smaller, under it, 'records'. This can be done by hand...or in photoshop. Dan has photoshop, and I have a hand. It'll work!
Sun on a roof.   So I have some big big plans to go see Leftover Crack and World/Inferno Friendship Society on the 26th of June with good friends Grace, Mike Boehner, and Alex, possibly a few more. It's at 3 p.m. in Brookyln, and there's another show at 8 with them, Morning Glory, and some other band. But either one will be amazing. I think i'll just say i'm going skating for the day, take a train, and arrive. Fun fun.   My mom is so annoying. I know that sounds dumb, but she really is. And it doesn't help being an alchoholic. Fuck. And I still haven't turned in my Baird Center form. It's so late. I hope they still let me have a show. Timmy's being nice with helping me get bands and stuff.   Maggie has announced that she likes me. That is too cool, because she's awesome, but i must not allow Monique to find out...She'd flip many shits. Man, i need a good Paint program. I also need Sountrack: mac, which Alex says he can get me for free. It would be awesome, but I don't know how he would.  I realized the other day...Sammy can get really annoying. Ah well, his funniness makes up for it tenfold. At least now he won't have to borrow my skateboard, Cause now he has his own! Hurrah.  Now I have to go take a Shower and do some Homework. That's the most productive thing i've done in days...When will school E
