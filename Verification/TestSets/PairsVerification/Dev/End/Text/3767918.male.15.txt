Luckily all my team turned up and were healthy so I didn't have to run :D Watched a film in English which was ok. Going to be playing Planetside tonight hopefully. I'll get some screenshots to make a better signature for Vasquez (my character's name).  What I've Been Playing:  Planetside. Lead a platoon last night. We resecured Amerish after a few hours and I got a few Command Experience Points. We were going to play a king of the hill game at a tower on the test server but it was just crap so we didn't bother.  In the News:  Saddam Hussein had his first court appearance today. He mocked the court and said he was still president. He refused to sign his legal papers and called the court a "theatre".  Construction of the barrier the Israeli military is constructing on the West Bank has been halted by an Israeli court. They say although the wall is legal, some sections cause too much disruption to the lives of Palestinians and must be re-routed.  Other Stuff:  Sony are working on a new Walkman model. It'll be a digital music player (an MP3 player that...Dosn't play... MP3s... lol, all will be explained) instead of an antique tape player. It is set to be Â£55 cheaper and with considerably more space than the top iPod model (which it is settot rival). However, there is a catch. It will only play music in sony's own special format - so u have to buy your music digitally from the sonyonlinee music store. However I'm sure some genius will make a program to convert MP3s to theSonyy format.  Can't wait until Saturday when I can see Kirsty!
What I've Been Doing:  Pretty average day at school on Friday. Saw Kirsty today :D haven't seen her for a week. She went shopping and blew her birthday money, then we went back to hers. Went on her new (huge) trampoline and... Other stuff ;)  What I've Been Playing:  Been leading platoons on Planetside, getting some CEP but not much :( good fun though :)  In the News:  I forgot to read the papers/websites/watch the news on Friday, so you'll just have to make something up for yourself.  Brazil has passed a law banning the carrying of firearms in public and making it illegal to own an unlicensed gun - with licensing rules similar to those in the UK. There is also to be a referendum to on whether to ban guns outright.  A car containing four Rumanians and bearing German number plates, has crashed into the security fence at the Houses of parliament. Two men have been arrested and police are trying to determine if the crash was deliberate or not.  Other Stuff:  Microsoft have upgraded their search engine to come close to the quality of commercial search engines like Google. They are also planning to release their own search engine software later this year.  The Hubble telescope has discovered around one hundred new planets orbiting distant stars. This makes the total of known planets to two hundred and t
