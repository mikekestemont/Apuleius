not and then as soon as it does and I get assigned my first report I am count'n down the days till summer. I'm wondering who my locker partner is gonna be first of all. I know that should be the least of my worries but its kind of a major thing to me. If its someone that I don't like they are just gonna have to deal with it when I drop my books on there head. Learn to to piss me off! If its someone I like then they will find our locker neatly organized and decorated with spirit grams that include that they exist in that locker too. Thats the perks of not have'n my foot up your ass =D! Last year my locker partner and I didn't get to see much of eachother because I rarely ever used my locker and I didn't do much decorate'n for that matter but I'm gonna be use'n my locker a lot more now that it will be on the 2nd floor. Its beyond me why we have a multi-million dollar penitentury lookin school and we still have to share lockers. I guess I don't mind. As of now I haven't taken many steps to get back into the swing of things for the school year. I still have my nights and days mixed up, I do have all my school clothes... but nothing picked out for the first day (I'll throw it together that morning),  I'm trying to put my binder together as we speak, I need to buy a shoulder bag for my books and shyt, and I still need to go to Journeys and buy those shoes. I have a million and one flip flops... every color of the rainbow and ever design imaginable... but I usually only wear my white, black, or brown ones. Flip flops are get'n a lil' old, dontcha' think. The only thing thats lasted as long as the fad of Flipper Floppers is flared jeans, and that I don't mind. What is it with people and make'n bands here in Waynesville? I know of about 5 bands right now and I have maybe heard 3 of them. Fiddlehead, David Churches old band, and then Will's band. Now all of a sudden here comes Jon Aviles and Stephanie Fowler ('Critical Issues' *Raised Eyebrow* ) and their bands. Oh, and muh' best friend has a band (Yay! Go Nickster!). Good luck to yall I guess. Hope no one sucks too bad. Personally I could never be in a band or even start one for that matter. I hate playing with people, I hate havein' to have structure, I know daym well we aren't gonna go anywhere, and I don't committ well to anything. I have better things to do with my time... but good luck anyway. If you are talented and driven' enough to do it, more power to ya. I guess I'll try to go get more of my binder and what not done. I'll talk atcha' later. Thanx for stop'n by.  Lates, L
