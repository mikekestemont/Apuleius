a little ticked off with a lot of people right now, just due to the fact that after all of the times I've tried to fit everything around them, they won't bother to ask for my input on certain decisions.  I was asked to go up to Jess's cabin, but because she clear things up with me on who was going, I've decided to not go at all.  I'm not going to go into too many details... thats the problem with a public blog.  "Slit my wrists and hope to die. Make my friends wonder why."  I was talking with Rachel, or should I say gossiping (such a sinful word), and she told me that supposedly someone told her they thought I was in a 'gothic mood.'  What the hell is a gothic mood?  There is no such thing...  Just because I've started to change who I hang out with because they're the ones who actually make plans with me, doesn't mean I'm gothic... I mean sure, I do wear a fair amount of black and offensive shirts... but that doesn't change who I am.  Or does it?  What's wrong with who I'm becoming, eh?  Not like you have tried to impact me in other ways, like calling to make plans, oh wait, you're too busy with your other friends... who are precisely the reason why I'm not going up to Jess's cabin.   I'm confusing myself.
Today was a good day.  I took my sister's shirt since she took my jacket, and it was a fun day wearing my "My mom thinks I'm at the movies" shirt.  I think I'll make an offer with her to buy it for like five bucks.  She needs the cash, and I need a cool Tshirt.  English was decent, I got to sit by Brad and Beznit and we listened to all the eulogy's and one award speech by other students, and of course then I get irritated with the bitch sitting across the room from me because she kept saying shit about kids that would get up to present.  I wanted to slap her.  When Alicia went up to present, I could read her lips saying to the girl next to her how pathetic Alicia's speech was, or she'd make comments about the cuts on her arms.  How rude.  When Alicia then went to go sit down, I saw her roll her eyes and mutter "Oh... my... God..."  SHUT DA FUCK UP, HO!  haha. that was fun.  Then I almost got stuck at school until 7 tonight because my ride almost ditched me (good thing I can run fast), but that's another story that I'm not in the mood to tell.  Today the band kids left for Hawaii, and I've still got one day left of school.  It doesn't bother me, amazingly enough the weeks are flying by, considering how boring and empty they are.  Tomorrow will be boring... so will my break.  I need a break though, everyone does.  I hate my school system.    Nonetheless, I feel very relaxed right now listening to B
