for a day of fishing. We were pretty successful and the water 8 miles out was surprisingly smooth. I cought a small sea robin and 2 croakers, my dad cought 3 croakers, and my uncle Danny cought a few croakers and a flounder. It was a successful day overall. That night we went to a somewhat cut-rate seafood place. I got rubber crab crackers and my baked potato looked like it was a week old and a grenade went off in it, but whatever. It was funny anyway.  The next day it was time to go shooting. We were shooting .223 and .242 rifles as well as the Glock and .38 revolver. We all did about average. Around 8PM everyone went to the really good Thai restaurant we found last year on the boardwalk at Rehoboth. Well, almost everyone.  My uncle Danny is stubborn and went for pizza.  I love it, though.  I got the spicy duck and a banana daquiri...drooolll.... After dinner we were greeted by tons of cops and fire fighters who were trying to pry a white Land Cruiser (remember that one?) from the front of a Grotto's Pizza restaurant. Evidently some kid got in it and plowed into the place. Funny stuff!  Yesterday we hit up the Air Mobility Command Museum at Dover AFB. It's small but really cool. There were some old planes there as well as past MAC stuff out on the ramp. While we walked around looking at the C-123s, C-141s, C-130s, and the like there were C-5s, C-17s, and E-3s doing touch-n-go's on the airbase. I've seen C-5s plenty before but to see them break onto final in a 45 degree bank half a mile off the end and then bring the lumbering, grinding beast to a smooth touchdown was really impressive. The idle thrust on the Galaxy sounds like a fire engine siren.  After that we had time to kill so we went shooting again. We shot one of the rifles that didn't work the other time and we all did alot better. My dad showed both my uncle and I up by firing 5 rounds through an area the size of a dime from 100 yards. He ruined my uncle's life, I think, because he's been trying to do it for 25 years and here comes my dad, someone who never shoots, and bam- he outguns him. The word spread like wildfire. My cousins were really ragging my uncle for it and Danny was talking about it up until we left for BWI.  We left the house at 8AM for the airport. The flight home was uneventful and pleasant but I was sad our trip was over. Delaware is the final trip of summer... a signal that it's almost time to get back to the old grind... it's kind of depressing. I like relaxing out on the east coast, but I guess I'll have to wait another year.
Some time in future I'll give everyone a full report on my Dulles day trip, but...well...for now let's just put up a picture, o
