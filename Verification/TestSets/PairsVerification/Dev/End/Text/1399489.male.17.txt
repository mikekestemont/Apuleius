Thank you guys! ~Migels
Music- Counting Crows- she talks to angels  Today was good, i got 7 stiches out (i had already taken 1 out myself lol) and had 2 good football practices.  ohh whats not cool though is that my cut opened back up after they came out, o well just a little blood.  Well tomorrow im off to las vegas! i think it will be fun, i feel like a lil alone relaxing/God time though and i doubt i can get it there so thats not cool.  I have just been 2 busy and hangin out with too many people latley and i want a break b4 school starts back.  Ohh and if u didnt know, were going to my sisters wedding in las vegas, but I'm really worried that my sister rushed into her new marriage too quickly and the worst is danielle, she's my little neice and she old enough to know whats going on, she doesnt seem to like it.  i just wish i could do something.  ok yeah i just felt like saying that, hope everybody has a good last few days (or maybe weeks for some of you) of summer.  its my last year in st.joe and madison and maybe all of mississippi.   thats kinda sad, i'll come back sometime.  alright buh bye buds!
