cares if Bill Gates is a prick, his products are great! And you're probably already using some of his stuff, no matter how much you hate him.    How can you keep the jobs in America, if no one wants anything to do with them?   And if you are a ps2, or gamecube fan, and think my politics talk is going no where, just wait a second, shits commin your way too.   Just because Xbox is newer, and has better graphics, doesn't mean that yall have to be haters.    I don't hate gamecube because it has shitty games.   I hate it because it has shitty graphics and no internal memory.    And ps2 is just old.    Don't buy something and love it when you know you can go better.    The choice is simple.    Buy an xbox. Not a ps2. Not a gamecube.   Why stand the crappy graphics, or low memory?   And if you think the xbox has bad graphics, don't blame the xbox! Blame the developers!    In the gaming business, it's all about the money. And supposedly, whoever gets their games out the fastest will make the most money. WRONG! Crappy graphics on mediocre games don't rake in the cash.    Blockbuster hits with innovative gameplay and graphics keep the money train riding along for a good long time.   Look at Halo, it's sold over 1 million copies, and people are still buying it!   Either way you look at it, when Halo 2 comes out, it will own you all.    November 9th, 2004.   Are you in?
Cables out. For the second time this week. Nothing to do.   Time to write. Books don't write themselves.   Time to look at what I have.   From what I think, it's not much.    I can't be sure.   I've been loosing it a lot lately.   Today I was mowing the lawn, turned around, and the other half of the yard wasn't cut.   I finished a book. The Color of Water.   Horrible. Shit. Crap. Terrible. Fucktapated.   Don't read it.    It's boring until the end.    Then they give you a shitty ending.   Did it leave a lot un finished? No.   Did it leave you wanting more? Hell no.   It sucked and that's all I have to say.

MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY Of course the crew won't come for me if they're all dead. If they're all dead and I alone am left to tell the tale. I'm crying, and my tears are made of sand.
