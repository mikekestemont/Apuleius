to anchor ur tots be it wild stupid chaotic frantic, sick etc etc there i said it all my diary....now to get the ball rolling....
i learnt tat even at the height of ur game calmness n being relaxed n clear minded with the spirit to learn/de brief  is the key to success example ppl tat play pool real well have a habit of smacking the ball in real hard into the pocket cuz its kind of an ego thing with tat last "kiak" as the black 8 ball rolls in with break neck speed or take example bowling yesterday some ppl like to spin it some jus throw it some use all their might to fling the ball into the pins only to end up in the 'drain'  'they're lousy wat!' or 'wah leow!!!!' r words of bitterness n the stubborn [its impossible or i can't lose] syndrome also known as the 'kiasu' disease esp in singapore but when u evaluate the situation n try to keep calm n use the learning spirit to evaluate the situation to try another method u find tat 'hey tis works man' or 'tis is the last time i'm doing tat'.... like mayb lightly with precision tapping in the black 8 ball or moving your wrist jus a tab to the left.....its not so hard if it works u jus found another way to do stuff but if it dun den its bout determination....'everythings possible, its jus how badly u want it'-adam khoo and if ya lose or things dun turn out the way u want it too (which always happens) dun get sore...get even hahahaha kidding evaluate n see how things went wrong...attack an obstacle from multiple angles the out come is seriously different....'always attack ur enemies strong point cus he wont b expecting it be in the middle of the battle cus thats living'-sal bandini.....with all tat said dun u think its funny?? some ppl work n slop all their lives n gain nothing...a routine tats all life is...some jus kick back n suddenly their rich but not everyone is like tat some work hard to maintain a stable carraer at the end of it ya gotta ask yourself...are u happy??? is this wat u want or is this where u see yourself 5 yrs down the row the young chaps would go ya den job hop the older chaps probably dun have a choice...all of us...fickle minded....so does it mean if i chill everyday i'll be wat they call happy go lucky??? mayb,maybe not 'god only helps those who r willing to help themselves'-the bible   jus a thought... think about it.....
this feeling of tactlessness feels horrible...its like taking a howitzer (see dictionary) shell point blank, getting hit by a bullet train....cracks n the dam can lead to a flood tats how my eyes feel....i dun even know wat i did wrong.... i'm so hurt....my body tells me to let it out n cry but my mind sez 'ur at work save it when u get home' i'm really hurt..... this feeling s
