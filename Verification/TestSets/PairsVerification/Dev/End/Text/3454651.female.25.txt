overtime and yet the only one who says thank you to me for doing this is my Senior Coordinator.  My head boss, her office is right next to my desk, I very rarely her, "Thank you, Whitney for all you hard work."  My normal working hours are from 8-5,  I get to work about 7:15 or 7:30 and stay until 5:30 or later, for some reason my services are never rewarded.  I guess from watching other coworkers of mine at ING, I should come in late and leave for a two hour lunch, then maybe call in a day after my birthday  saying I can't come in cause I have a hangover.  But if my boss was a man I should just start going out with him and be put on all of our departments committees, just because I'm screwing the boss!        I thought when working for any major company that its frowned on for sleeping with the boss?  One would thing this was not acceptable but who am I?  My head boss for my department is very loud!  Granted my voice does carry and I'm well aware of that, but when your boss walks so loud that it sounds like a heard of elephants stampeding around 3rd floor that you kind of wonder.  I have never had a boss that knew absolutely nothing about what I do in her department.  She is more worried about her and the life side of our department then anything else! When she steps off the elevator she screams "Chuck!" She sends everyone in my group e-mails saying "Please keep your voices down and cut down the socializing!"  I'm sorry you point one figure at me there are three pointing right back at you!  She sends us e-mails at 3 in the morning!  She always looks like she pissed of at the world, and she loves to flirt with every guy on our floor!  No wonder why she still isn't married or has a boy friend she intimidates everyone!  She hates getting phone calls from the agents out in the field who may have issues that I myself can not answer or can but they don't like my answer to give them.  Well recently I received a phone call from an agent out in California who wished to speak with my head boss, not knowing that she was standing near my desk, I told the agent that she was in a meeting and advised him to leave a message in her phone mail box.  Before the agent could say another word, you hear Amy say, "Way to go Whitney, great thinking to tell the agent that I'm in a meeting!"  Amy as a loud voice and the agent heard her scream that in the background.  So thank God I'm a PR major when the agent said to me, "Yes, I guess I will leave her a massage if she is in a so-called meeting."  I was like yes sir she is indeed in a meeting.       Until, next time when I feel like venting yet a
