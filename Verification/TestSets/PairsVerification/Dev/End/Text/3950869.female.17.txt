will be able to guess who I am.&nbsp; I'm at Beth's house right now, earlier Uncle Tom, Darren and Clare, and Uncle John were here.&nbsp; This is going to be short-  Au revoir.
I didn't get to sleep until about 3:00 in the morning and then woke up at 7:30.&nbsp; Miki worried me because I thought we were going to be late for our flight.&nbsp; But of course, we got there way before time.&nbsp; There was a mixup with the tickets Miki and Christopher had, so their luggage was "temporarily" lost.&nbsp; Hahaha.&nbsp; After we got picked up by Uncle Tom and Aunt Kathy we went on over to my Aunt Ann Marie's.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was nice-I saw my Uncle Frank and Aunt Eileen as well.&nbsp; Then we had this nice little barbecue...tasty, I think I can officially say, I like shrimp! Tomorrow we'll be going over to my cousin Beth's house and stay there for a day or two.&nbsp; I think we're also going to the boardwalk.&nbsp; That's all I have to say for now, I feel like I'm ignoring my hostsssss.  &nbsp; Goodnight YouS Guys.
Hmm...I already have a journal type thing online already on xanga.&nbsp; But I feel like this one is going to be different in a way.&nbsp; Tomorrow I'll be leaving for New York and Jersey.&nbsp; I love it up there-the feeling is amazing.&nbsp; So different from the coast...well at least to me that is.&nbsp; Not so sure I could live in a big city like that though.  It's 11:07 right now and Christopher, my nephew, is on the couch asleep-and here I am typing for myself, sipping fruit juice, and listening to Journey's faithfully.&nbsp; Music-I love it.&nbsp; All varieties, whatever catches my ear, whatever catches my emotions...country, alternative, soft rock, latin, jazz, the genres go on and on.&nbsp; Ha-it's 11:11 right now...reminds me of Puja in class.&nbsp; She never missed making a wish on that thing.&nbsp; Occasionally I would wish, just for the fun of it too.&nbsp; It's exciting about going off to college, but I still have longing for the past.&nbsp; I kinda want to go back one more year-not possible I know. &nbsp; It's a mystery. But they still try to see  Why something good could hurt so bad... One love feeds the fire. one heart burns desire. Wonder whose crying now? ----Journey. &nbsp; Night.
You build me up You knock me down Provoke a smile And make me frown You are the queen of runaround You know it's true You chew me up And spit me out Enjoy the taste I leave in your mouth You look at me I look at you Neither of us know what to do There may not Be another way to your heart So I guess I'd better find a new way in I shiver when I hear your name Think about you but it's not the same I won't be satisfied 'til I'm under your skin Immobilized by the thought of you Paralyzed by the sight of you Hypnotized by the words you say. Not true but I believe them a
