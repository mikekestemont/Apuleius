and Sunday off like everyone else. Not to mention that it's really hard to meet a member of the female persuassion when you're work schedule is bucked the hell up. I mean, imagine the conversation:      Me: "So, you want to go out this week?"    Her: "Sure, how about Saturday night?"    Me: "Uh, that won't work, I work on Saturday night, every Saturday night."    Her: "Loser."      And there endeth the conversation.
I bought a new bag today, after my previous "cheap as hell, on sale from the Gap" bag failed to fufill it's general purpose; namely, not tearing my neck from my shoulders. The new bag is a nice large flapdoozy tech from a NY based store called YakPak, but's that not important, I just figured that someone out there might want to check out their on-line store,  urlLink YakPak.com ; anyway, my previous bag shopping trips have been fairly simple expiditions, go to Target, or some other equally generic place and buy whatever was on-sale at the time. However, this bag was different. I put research into this bag. I Googled examples from the web, compared prices, shopped around for what was in the City, compared features, and finally, posted notes on forums and IRC channels to see if there was any feedback. In short, I put work into finding this bag.    I did all this because it came to me that I really need a bag, just for daily living. It carries my various notebooks, pens, pencils, calculator, cleaner for my glasses, whatever book I happen to be reading at the time, my cell phone, and my I-pod (see http://thisthinghere.blogspot.com for my love of I-pods), among other items. All of which are pretty much essential for my "21st century digital-boy" lifestyle; (first person who can tell me where that quote came from wins a... nice e-mail). if I had a laptop, it would go in there as well, and the only reason I don't have a laptop is that I have other things that I need to spend $1000 on, not that I want to, but some things are inevatable, like new timing belts.    The point of this seemingly pointless e-mail is this: Congratulations ladies, you won. Equality is here, men now can not live without bags to carry all our shit.

I'm tired........, so tired........, I'm tired of being here, so tired. I'm spread......, so thin........., I don't know where I am...      Actually, I do; and that's the problem. I've had a total of 5 hours of sleep in the past 48 and it's starting to wear on me. Like today. I went to bed at around 09:00 or so (when you work a grave shift, one's sleep schedule is a mess). Anyway, that seemed like a good time to crash out, but then woke up about 3-hours later and couldn't get back to fucking sleep. So now, I want to sleep, but of course I can't since I'm working. I know, I'm just whining, but dammit, you'd whine if you'd been up too  bloody  long t
