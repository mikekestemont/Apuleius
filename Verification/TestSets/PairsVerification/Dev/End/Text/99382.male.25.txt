My friend  urlLink Nick Chester  [creator of the humerous website  urlLink TwinTracker.com ] was quoted on  urlLink page 3  of a news article on Salon.com titled  urlLink "An Olsen intervention" .  Nick Chester, store manager and creator of  urlLink the Twin Tracker , which cross-references the age of the Olsen twins with the age of legal consent with each of the 50 states of America. He says he had plans to update the site as the years passed and the Olsens' birthday approached, but subsequently lost interest in it -- especially after receiving a cease-and-desist order from the Olsens' lawyer, demanding him to take the girls' images down from the Twin Tracker site.   It's hard to give the Olsen Twins advice on what direction they should take now that they're turning 18. Soon they won't be able to get away with making corny, faux hip-hop videos about the plight of high school crushes or plaster their faces all over boxes of third-rate beauty supplies, and that can be quite a problem, no?  One viable option is to astonish the world and ring in their newfound "sorta kinda adulthood" by going all out and giving the people what they want: a Hustler spread. On the other hand, and more seriously, if they ever do intend on being taken seriously as actresses, they're going to have to do some projects independently. Because until Mary-Kate releases a solo record or Ashley lands a role in which she doesn't have a twin sister, they're still the Olsen twins and not individuals. Because at this point, it's just getting creepy.   Well said!
