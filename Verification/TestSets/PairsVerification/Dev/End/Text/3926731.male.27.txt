the world on top of a beat. Needless to say, someone told me that it was "tight". HA!  Okay, okay, okay. So, not all rap artists are copycats of sound and lyrics, but a majority are. Maybe that's why I love the music of the 70's and 80's so much. There were some decent bands in the 90's too. Who can say that  urlLink Led Zeppelin  copied anyone? What about Heart? Granted some people hate the stuff they did in the 80's, but it was still good! I think that is why the music of those years have stood the test of time. It's all different. You could tell by the music who someone was. The voice told you, the lyrics even told you.  I love emo. It's todays punk in my opinion. It's very emotional. The lyrics are extremely poetic and the rhythms change like the weather outside. It's great stuff. If you want to hear some, just look over to the right of this post and see what songs I have listed. There's websites to click on to. Back to what I was saying. I'm disgusted with the radio. I listen to mostly CDs. I would say that it's probably 99% of the time. Philaces at  urlLink The Black Hole  has introduced me to  urlLink XM . When I finally get a job, I think I'm going to invest in one of those wonderful toys!

Last night I was having a major problem sleeping. It seems this is a reoccuring thing, night after night. Back to last night, I popped in a  urlLink Learn Japanese In Your Car  CD into my  urlLink XBox  around 3am. I had to try something, so I laid back in my bed and let that play. I think I have stumbled upon the insomniac's best friend. Not only did I finally fall asleep, but I think I've learned a few words also. So, Arigato Gozaimasu, to the lady who does the translations in the CD!  Well, the day, as I stated earlier has been very unproductive. I did catch a little bit of the  urlLink 2004 Olympic Games  on NBC. I was commenting on how those gymnasts can do all of those things. It's pretty amazing. The swimming wasn't too bad either. It did dawn on me that I really didn't enjoy watching them too much. I'm just patiently waiting on football to start up. When that happens, then there will be something to watch. By the way, the  urlLink Georgia Bulldogs  are ranked #4 and #3 in the Coaches' Poll and the AP Poll! Go Dawgs, sic 'em! Woof, woof, w
