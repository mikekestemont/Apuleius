second floor, and the escalator is made up of small metal sections, about 4 inches wide, which fit together to form a slanted surface rather than steps. Then, when you've finished shopping, the shopping cart attaches magnetically to the surface and you can take it downstairs and right outside. Neat!!!
Hua Hin in a beach resort area a few hours south of Bangkok.  It has a wonderful beach area (think Grand Beach sand) with horses if you would like to ride, and chairs and umbrellas to rent for the day, which we have not done yet.  I confess that I still haven't been actually swimming, as I've been too busy with other things.  There are a number of things to see around the town and area, and Karen and I are moving rather slowly--trying to keep sweating down to small streams rather than rivers running off our faces.  Taking showers a number of times a day cuts down on sightseeing time as well.  Yesterday we scouted out the temple in town.  There are a number of buildings in a large enclosed area. One is a library, set up with Dewey decimal system (the books weren't marked...only the 100's above the shelves).  We found a section of English books, including Gone with the Wind, Mental Health, Readers' Digest, National Geographic, and some on hygiene and ethics for public healthnurses....all apparently very old.  The building was not kept up well in many areas...an old couch with the foam showing, things stacked up in corners, but a gentleman sitting at a table reading.  We found the main temple (obvious by the shoes left outside). People were buying bits of gold leaf to press onto a Buddha image (and 4other male images...more Buddhas?)  At one end was a hollowed out flat stone (about the size of a coffee table). People would press gold leaf into it, and some had left coins, which then were becoming imbedded into the leaf.  Some people would sit (mermaid style) in front of the Buddha, and shake atall cylinder filled with wooden sticks (which would rattle), and light Joss sticks (incense).  In the afternoon, we saw the old railway station.  It was built especially for one of the kings in the 1920's, and I don't think it's changed much since.  It reminded me very much of the railway setup at the Children's Museum or at the Manitoba Museum.  Got a picture of Karen going through what looks like a saloon door!  For supper we met Ev and Vic, and also the other Lertlah teachers at The Admiral's Head, a restaurant that serves what they think are the best hamburgers this side of Wpg.  After that, Karen and I strolled through the Night Market.  Some areas are regular stores, some are permanent booths, some are temporary moveable food and goods stalls set up along both sides of some of the streets.  There was quite a crush of people, and corresponding crush of sounds and smells.  I'm learning to bargain, and bought a ring that I think I will be very fond o
