these things. I can't stand imperfectons!! Ironic, since  I'm  so imperfect. Oh well. I babysitted again. I hope your day was shittier than mine. Just kidding! Oh yes, I'm going to sign up for a Xanga. I  might  move, most probably not, because I think it has a shitty interface. Persuade me. C'MON!     BTW: I took one of those test thingies, ya'know the one about your favorite cuss word. Mine turned out to be  shit . That was the best moment of my life ;_;
12 hour battery? Through the firmware? Basically... it's just a 3G iPod with a mini clickwheel. There is no new battery. Just "better power management." So 3G iPods could technically have 12 hour battery life... It's just Apple doesn't want us to.    BTW... I think its fucking ugly.. c'mon what's with the  grey  wheel?
My pose didn't come out right. BTW, webcams suck for pics. &nbsp;
I read that one post, "Here Comes the Pain" and it made me think...  Damn I'm a pussy. SO ANYWAYS... My comp is broken, I have to wait a  MONTH to get it back.  Ugh, well.. meh, I kinda like my brother's  computer better... So lemme tell you some of my dreams... This one  dream, I was at this grocery store, then the police run in and they're  chasing this old lady. So she stops near the lettuce and takes out a  gun.. THEN this dude that looks like George Huff on Sherbert's body  come in and start laughing at the lady. The lady shoots him down, while  the police stand right next to me just staring... So then, the lady  starts rushing at us and the police run out. Next thing I know, I was  running with Mike... I look down my shirt, and I see 5 pinkish holes,  no blood. Funny because one was directly on my nipple.. So I ask Mike,  did you get shot too? And he tells me he got shot 9 times. NINE?!  Anyways, it ended there. Yeah, just a dream... doesn't fit together  much though...
