to her more often and she might burn me 2 cd's :) ...... and today dan called me from washington d.c., so that was cool.  As for my soccer game that i so desperately looked forward to........................we lost. It was fun though and that's all that matters and plus i got to see some of my friends.  Alot of people are making websites now... like all of my friends have one now... it's funny cuz it's like the new craze.... but its cool.  Well.. this still isnt that long, but eventually i will have something to talk about that will take up some good space....
Well, i just woke up and had McDonald's for lunch which i shouldnt have had cuz ihad the choice of it or Subway... i didnt know what i was thinking...  Today i have a soccer game... so thats what im going to look forward to, but it isnt until 7:15 tonight... Maybe jake or jon can come over or something, cuz i havent done anything with them in a while...  So i guess im probably gonna go back to sleep or something :(
It's really hard for me to believe that this year i will be a junior in high-school...2 more years 'till college... now i know that sounds wierd to act like i dont belong or something cuz i do, its just i dont know what im gonna do after highschool... well it is kind of wierd.. but i was reminded today when my mom wanted all of the pictures of me EVER...  She is putting together a scrap book thingy for when i graduate.. which is coming soon.. and its wierd to like "look back" on the things that i have done... LoL.. wait isnt that a lyric for a song.. oh well. anyway... i just really need to like focus on one thing or something cuz im only 16 yet i have soooo many things to worry about, most of which i shouldnt, but still... I don't even know what major i would take when i go to college, excuse me,  IF  i go to college...  Well whoever reads this.. which i hope is at least someone.. please pray for me, that i will get things straight with my school life....
Well, summer isnt over yet... but i kind of wish it was... I've been sooo lazy and it actually really makes me very mad... i never got a job and i've been 16 since april and havent gotten my permit yet or even gone to take the test for it... Summer is basically over for me tho, cuz i just want school to start and get back on track and get a schedule again... and plus i cant wait for soccer to start and to be able to hang out with my friends and also because i like fall/autumn, whatever you want to call it. Well this has been my very first blog... so its ofcourse going to either be short or long and mine is short but later on i will have longer o
