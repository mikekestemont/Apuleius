in her web journal, "DIARY! a horrible thing happened and I mean the worst thing in the world! Halla's moving away and I mean AWAY! to Africa and on the worst day EVER! I mean on Christmas..... I mean.... I would have been bummed, but not as bummed as on my Birthday! I felt so bad that I said that I was okay with it, OKAY WITH IT! Well.. I'm gonna shop online for a while, it usually helps." Then she signed off as she always does, "Mary Jane Williams". Halla moved away, but Mary Jane found two stylish friendship bracelets and the first charms she bought for them was a plane (because she's moving), a lion (for the lions in Africa), and finally a house, so she won't forget her home.  Two years went by and Halla got married to the guy that owned the animal shelter. He was eight years older than her which means Halla was 20 years old and he was 28 years old. Halla is having her first child at age 22. Mary Jane went to see Halla because Halla said she was pregnant. Mary Jane went over to Africa carrying two new charms for Halla. One charm was a bride and a groom to symbolize her marriage, and one charm was a baby for her first child. Mary Jane lived a long life. She had 15 kids and a huge mansion.  Halla stayed in Africa and helped conserve wildlife with her husband and had 3 kids and lived out her years in the African jungle, while&nbsp;Mary Jane devoted her life to caring for her own children, foster children and adopted children.  The End.
