have wanted to write something for a long time now. It's just that i have had no specific inspiration as of now. Nobody has really pissed me off in a long while. No specific reason to write anything either.   Should i?
20 km.  More goofing. Me likes. Going to bike more later today. I even managed to cruise down a little hill-thingie (wich didnt seem that innocent while i was doing it). The "bombhole" near the lung clinic, if anyone cares. Probably not.  Heading out to get my hair cut right now. Uf all goes well, i WILL have them cut. So we will see.
urlLink LOW MORALE   Flash music video. Immense work gone into this as you can see. Respect. Check out the rest of the  urlLink site  as well.
20 km.  Just goofed around, basically. JÃ¤nese track and back to town via the Tartu - Tallinn "highway" currently under construction. Then did some stair climbing/unclimbing. And then there was the jump. I managed to jump, yes. Something i previously thought impossible at my level of biking morale. Thanks to Lasse, who kept disrespecting me until i jumped. Had he not been there, i woulda done it in half the time i did it or not done it at all.   And oh, im not getting the camera because the gentlemen at the US photo shop decided to NOT give a discount after all. Or something like that. So my relative didnt buy the camera and is coming back with nothing. Just to mention, he wasnt in the US only to buy the cam. I'll have to figure out another way now. Stupid american fucks. (I bet that as soon as i publish this post i'll have CIA or FBI or both knocking at my door. As a positive side, i ll probably be getting tons of hits from the islamic countries. All due to the sentence above. Well, it isnt technically a sentence, because it doesnt have a verb in it. Oh bother.)

Alles rites.  Back from Hiiumaa. It was a good trip, i suppose. Consisted of the things one might usually do when one is in Hiiumaa (did i get the preposition right?). Aviation show on saturday, boat trip to saaremaa on sunday. That's pretty much it too. Good company. Oyea, we cooked lots, too. That usually happens when my father is around. He takes that stuff rather seriously. Not that i wouldnnt like cooking myself. As for the weekend, we had it so that he prepared the stuff and i grilled what needed grilling. Beef on saturday, two (not one, mind you) ducks on sunday. One duck roasted, the other grilled. I dont generally like duck and this was no different. It was edible, but duck has a specific taste i dont like. Just like liver.   I will probably post some pictures later, when i get my hellos and picasas reinstalled.  [music: Drumagic - Easy Boom]  First (and possibly best) piece from a d'n'b album i have. Well worth l
