mind.   It's even better if he kills his own father over someone, say, his twin sister? Ironic, isn't? You destroy your own flesh and blood for someone who's not even related to you, just because the person's your "soul mate." Beautiful the way love works. I benefit a lot out of this love. Just because I made my guy think that he's not loved by anyone, not even his precious sister. Ahh... I'm going to love working this body out. Not to mention the guy has knives in his closet, sharpened fully. It's a good thing he's getting into karate, then maybe I'll persuade him into ninjutsu, and, hmm... Maybe koppo as well. Please don't misunderstand this, I am not evil. I'm just sarcastically taking pleasure in the pain of others. Especially the pain of my guy. The more pain he feels, the more pleasure I get. It's actually a good thing his twin sisiter came into his life, at least he wouldn't just go get himself killed, just because he doesn't want her to cry for him. Really funny the way my sister's mind works, right? She gets a guy to like a girl, sure, not the normal infatuation situation she often sets my guy up on, gets it to the point that he treats her as more important than himself, and as such, with my other sister's help, convinces him not to commit suicide. Then, we make him believe that the love is one sided, until he gets really depressed. When he's depressed, sure, he'll think about suicide, but then he'll think about this twin of his, and stops. So what's his other alternative? He needs to kill someone, but he can't kill himself, he won't kill his twin sister, and he doesn't like his dad much. It's basically a hundred percent sure win for me, although that twin sister of his just has to prove to him that she really loves him as well, and this plan goes bye-bye, then I'll have to wait for another opportunity. What do you guys think?  (Shi wa Tenshi in sarcastic mood)
Ahh... God is good! This body isn't perfect, yet it's good enough. It's kinda light, lithe, strong, supple, and it only needs training, then it can fit my likes. I'm still chained up. This guy just doesn't give up! He's still chaining me up inside his mind, just because he's afraid to hurt his twin sister. I'll wait for some time, although I might have to let him taste my power for him to allow me to come out. He nearly unchained me when he almost killed his classmate with a little rock, and that was when he was just in grade two. Oh well, instance wasted. I think I was still groggy then. But now that I'm awake, this girl steps in and helps her twin brother chain me up. Maybe I should teach him a little prayer to give him some power. I'll think it up first. For now, that's all, and again, Watashi wa  Shi wa Tenshi !
