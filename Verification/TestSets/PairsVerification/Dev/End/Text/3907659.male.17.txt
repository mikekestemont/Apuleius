little more time and then Alex and Ashley came over and we watched "50 First Dates".  Excellent movie.  Now I'm on here, yay!
todays highlights -got my schedule which I'll hopefull get it changed tomorrow -mowed the lawn -went to Cory's "Going away party" that's it, pretty boring huh  -oh, jessica got a new phone, it's a camera one
these past two days have consisted of being bored and being border.  Yesterday, I got to go out during the day which was fun for the most part, got home, took a nap, and then went to see Joey come back from his mission.  That was about it.  Today consisted of sitting at home, watching too much TV and eating just to have something to do.  I hate days like that.  Oh well, tomorrow I might actually do something so that's something to look forward to.
Where did the summer go?  It just seems unreal being back in school, like I just got out yesterday!  But HALLELUIAH for being a SENIOR!!!  Just 179 days left before freedom, FINALLY!  As far as my classes go, Team sports should be fun, as well as oceanography (b/c of the people in it)...Math on the other hand seems like it'll be a bit more challenging than last year, and European History will hopefully be easier than I'd originally thought.  Other than that, I came home today and took a looooooooong nap, got a new phone and that CAR!
yeah these past 2 days have had more ups and downs than the rollercoasters at Michigan's Adventure (so not very many, but still some).  First the ups... We got a new, HUGE TV!  It's humungus!  like 62 inches!  also, my parents are looking into buying a car for me, a black '98 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo!  Muy excitingo!  y que mas?  OH, my parents are also looking at getting me a new phone after the tragic car door incident, and I finally got to talk to Caity from Canadia!  Good stuff huh!  Now for the downs.  I found out about a situation with one of my friends that makes me realy sad, and I found out that I am BANNED from the 6 stake dance this saturday, whihc I was looking forward too.  OH, and the USA mens basketball team lost too.  But anyways, about the dance.  The stake presidency banned me, my friend chris, and my former friend, Cameron from the up coming dance b/c of "what happened" on the bike trip.  I mean really, we didn't do anythig BAD, and most of what they got upset with us for were a bunch of misunderstandings!  My dad says he's gonna talk to president cheney about it and give them his point of view of things (basically my point-of-view of the situation, but less biased), but I really don't care about it at the moment.  I'm just sick of the leaders riding us before we even do anything.  But whatever, I'm just stressed now, so I'll stop.
yeah, I can't concentrate at the moment so I'll fill you in tomorrow, actually, later t
