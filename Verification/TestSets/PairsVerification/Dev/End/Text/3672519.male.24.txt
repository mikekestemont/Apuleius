curry puff pastry and other carbohydrates. Gawain eats just for attention. Otherwise, he demands only love. The adorable little bitch.
School starts Monday. Need to read 30 journal articles. Portugal Vs Greece launches in twilight zone. Have to finish unpacking room. Have to conduct an interview. Have to cut hair and get a tan. I thrive on the hum of mild panic.    Its going be my final year, and there's only one thing I know with absolute certainty: all hell shalt break loose. For hopefully the last year in a long time I will be sleeping less, playing less, reading less, exercising less, dating less (not like I did much of all this in the first place), snacking more, smoking more, pc-gaming more, worrying more, whining more and weighing more.

I loved it! Cheerfully blockbustered - The nerdy anti-hero, the ditsy love interest, the vertiginous villian, the tormented buddy, the pearls-o-wisdom geriatric.

If sound waves carry on to infinity, where are their screams now? I imagine them somewhere in the galaxy, moving forever towards the psalms. "  - Anne Michaels, Fugitive Pieces
urlLink    On the 9th of August 2004 Singapore celebrated its 39th birthday. I toasted the moment in characteristic style by photographing the fireworks from the perch of my favourite drinks haunt, NUSS suntec, and as expected, this was the only presentable shot I could salvage from a dozen fuzzy sparkles.  Ever searching, albeit self-consciously, for the multitudinal symbolisms of life's moments,I think the above sums up my general place in my nation's fabric. The cloth definately aint red. Like a dazzling, half-blurred burst of white I find myself filling the sky, unintentionally propelled into the present from the embers of my parents, my forefathers, who have painstakingly scaled, then eventually consumed, the distant, dark treetops of history.
