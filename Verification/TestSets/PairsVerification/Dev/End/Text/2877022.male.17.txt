and watch the fireworks too. haha, thanks to elsa. after that was chaotic cos all the crowd tried to jay-walk across the road to marina shopping centre ( i think that's the name). of cos, we broke the rule too. some time later, we reached suntec city. that place sux! we spent 1 hour juz to search for affordable food with short Q. in the end, we settled with sandwiches from carrefour's delight corner. haha. den, going home from suntec is problematic too. since the collaspe of nicoll highway, many suntec's busstop are no longer in use. *damn it* once again, like last week, nus and i ( this time plus a couple more ppl) were trapped at suntec. we finally boarded a bus from esplanade (it's still crowded, think 5566 went to perform, i saw them when i'm on the bus) at 11+. needless to say, by the time i rched home, it's   THE NEXT DAY !!!      nevermind, juz to let S08s noe, i've never regretted to sign up for this CIP. Though it's not a nice way to spend a sunday, we got to spend it together in an interesting way. isn't it fun that we cracked our brains and try to find a way out together. that would certainly bind us together. heehee. haha,   love you guys and gals, we rock!!!

I S  AW   MY C LA Y CL  ONE     at first i was distracted by his hair..cos it was some afro hairstyle thing..but his FACE.it's an EXACT COPY i tell u.he had DREAMY EYES which sort of gently closes as he glances past(claymates would understand) and he had the SAME NOSE and LIPS.   crap    lah!never take photo!!!all i have now is the best memory i've ever had ever since this year started.  i dunno what's happening here in singapore...somehow clay sightings have gone up..check this page out  urlLink http://s2.invisionfree.com/Clay_Aiken_Singapore/index.php?showtopic=1515  its an article on this person who saw ANOTHER lookalike at ntu canteen.looks like i'll be heading there for many meals to come..HAHA. -
