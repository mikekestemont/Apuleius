the back of my mind, i was thinking about the possibility of infection and even worse, tentanus.  Did some reading up on tentanus, ====One of the questions=====  Was the cut or puncture from dirty or contaminated objects, such as rusty nails or objects in the soil or did a puncture go through a shoe, especially a rubber-soled one? (Note: you will need a tentanus shot if you have not had one within 5 years (for a major wound) or if you had not had one in the last 10 years (for a minor wound).) If yes to one of these symptoms described above, please see your doctor. ======================  Was feeling ok till abt 9+ pm at nite, when i started feeling weak and a little feverish. I mean a lot of thoughts were running through my mind.  Will the doctor laugh at me cos the wound is so small? Am i over-reacting? Am i jus sleepy? Will it be too late if i dun do something abt it soon?  In the end, i decided to pop over to the docs anyway. Afterall, better be safe then very sorry.    ~jab~     *ouch* and no.. the doc didnt laugh at me
I need to buck up on my programme. Somehow i dun seem to have the same drive as before! Next Monday!! i will commence the whole thing all over again! I will not dwindle! I will not sway! I will stick it to it!  Exercise at the right intensity, eat correctly! that's right!   'Bill Philips.. Where are you??!'
Met up with my sec sch gal prefect gang on Sat. It was on the pretext to celebrate Seri's marriage. Was good to meet up and to catch on what's happening.  Seri - Flying with SIA, married. Alicia - Masters in Material Sci, seeing an Indonesian Shawn - Masters in Chem, unattached at the moment. Simin - Masters in Archi, seeing a Brit Cheryl - Working with a startup, enjoying her job, heading to India this yr end on a pilgrimage, seeing a Msian.  Suddenly, i realise a trend. A growing female proportion are not seeing local Singaporean men. I mean outta that 6 females, 4 (including myself) are seeing men from other countries whilst 1 is unattached and the other married to a native Malay.  That is pretty interesting.  Cheryl was telling me that there is such a thing called a Working holiday visa, where u can be employed over ur holiday. And she is thinking of applying for one since her Msian boy is currently in UK.  *gasp* me too.. so i can be with my dearie in Melb.  I looked up on holiday visa to Aust ... ============================================================ Nationals of some countries (who are under 31 years of age) are able to obtain a Working Holiday Maker visa that allows short term employment combined with visiting Australia for up to one year. At this stage, Singapore nationals are NOT entitled to working holiday visas. Check Fact Sheet 55 at  www.immi.gov.au  for more details and a list of eligible nationalities. ============================================================  to my disappointment.................... *
