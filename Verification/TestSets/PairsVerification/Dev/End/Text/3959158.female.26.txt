be , yet all that He has created me to be...eventually I will grasp that these coincide. I see the person that I am becoming and it excites me. Not because of anything that I have achieved, but because I can see the miracle within me. I see the person I was, I am, and who I am becoming and I am awed by the work of his hand. Who ever thought he would take a snobby materialistic girl and change me into who I am being molded into?  I look over my relationships and am awed. I think back to years past and all of my friendships were somewhat superficial. This year brought some relationships to a close, but by the closing it brought a depth of love and understanding to some that lacked. It also brought the emotional availability to invest in new friendships. My friend Matt, who I would say is my best friend, has taught me new things that I never thought I could learn. We have fought over everything there is to fight over, disagreed on everything, and for a period of time could not stand each other. I have a greater understanding of fighting for people in relationships because he fought for me. He did not give up and now he is reaping the fruit of his hard labor...I am no longer a bitch(most of the time). I guess that is a miracle...he would say so. My friends Trissa, Julie, and Curtis have all had a hand in shaping me into the person that I am becoming. Entry after entry usually includes something that one of them has said to encourage, stimulate, or piss me off. It is so good.         These are pictures that were taken from my 26th birthday party. The picture with Trissa, Alicia, Matt and I, is my favorite. Allisha and Matt both helped out tons to get the party ready. They both know how stressed out I get at events that I am planning and so they were right there keeping me together. About an hour before the party Matt took over and finished getting things ready while I got dressed. Trissa and Jon arrived about a 1/2 hour later and Jon(who is not familiar with my pre-party stress) said, "Someone get this girl a drink." Trissa replied, "This is just how she is before the party. As soon as people begin to arrive she will be a completely different person...laughing, enjoying herself." She was right. It is so nice to have people in your life that know you so well. These relationships continue to go through trials and tribulations and each time we all learn a new meaning for words like love, forgiveness, understanding, and compassion. I am the person I am because of the people that play the part they are supposed to play in the symphony of life. Each instrument, each note being played, sometimes not harmonically, but after much practice and devotion...the music is played and flows into the beautiful melodies that are intimate relationships.   Peace  K
