dangerous peak when man perfects the ultimate species. A species so advanced that man falls victim to his own creation - the ROBOTRON. Guided by their infallible logic, the Robotrons concluded: the human race is inefficient and must , therefore, be eliminated. Due to genetic engineering error, you possess Superhuman powers. Your mission: to stop the Robotrons and save the last of the Human Race. You are the only hope for mankind!   Now, let's examine this for a minute. First of all, the humans from the game invented the Robotrons? These guys can't even get out of the way of a moving milk truck. Second of all, their savior was not genetically modified to save them -- that was an  accident . "Ha-ha, well, Mr. Walton, there's been a little 'oopsie' down at the lab... we gave you superhuman reflexes and a four-way laser! Gosh, sorry. I know, you just wanted green eyes, I don't know, I've just been so brain-dead lately with these long hours and..."   Not to mention the fact that you're laboring so intensely to destroy the evil Robotrons to save -- well, frankly, a race of what one can only conclude are blind, deaf, autistic morons -- lends a certain sense of bathos to the whole affair.   Still, lasers. Huh? And don't even get me started on Galaxian and Galaga and their orderly formation attacks against an army of one. I guess the supposition is that in the future, the admiralty of the alien space armadas will be manned entirely by control-freak interior decorators.   But anyway. I started thinking about all this because I saw an ad online and started playing the demo of  Crimsonland , which reminds me a lot of good ol' Robotron in many ways. You're a single soldier trying to survive in a world full of hostile, Starship-Troopers-like aliens who attack for no particular reason. Thankfully, your guy is neither the subject of accidental genetic tampering by a race of cretins, nor beholden to save said cretins from their own berserko creations. (Hey, speaking of berserk, how about Berzerk? There was another cool game.) All you have is your trusty limitless ammunition and an endless supply of handy power-ups, thoughtfully dropped by your attackers upon their deaths. Those marauding bands of murderous aliens -- always so helpful in a pinch.   Unlike Robotron, this game is full of carnage; it's a little less frenetic than its spiritual successor, but makes up for it in sheer relentlessness. In addition to the very fun shotgun, assault rifle, flame thrower, and "nuke" weapons, there are a variety of "perks" you get for surviving the game and collecting experience, such as fast reloading, extra ammo, or the ability to shoot faster. (Really, don't we all want to shoot faster, deep inside?) The demo only gives you one lousy life, but if you've played a lot of Robotron in your youth, you should be able to give the alien bastards a run for their money.   Not bad, for having neither spaceships nor lasers. I guess you can't have e
