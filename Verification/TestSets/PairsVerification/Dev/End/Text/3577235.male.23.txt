am not in a place I am able to have one.
I can't see it.  I think there are people like me.  I am not the only one feeling that way.  But this intellectua thinking does not help me feeling left out, or lonely, or desperate.  I certainly know I am very lucky, I got a great house full of people who care about me.  The problems are all mine.  I can't find solutions.  I look at left, I turn my head to the right, I am scared.  Future is a blank, when I put my eyes forward.  I want a break, but I could not reach it.   The problems seemed so simple.  The solution is much easier.  I could just list all the solutions here.  I need to get up early.  I need to get slim down and tune up my body.  I should not delay anything I should do or asked to do.  I should do what I like and be consistent with it.  When temptation comes, I should turn my head away from it, maybe go doing something I like, or go talk to people to distract myself from that lure or escape from it.

This March, I had a turtle from my sister, and they are dead now.  One became a mummy, the other one was buried at my backyard.  I loved them.  But I certainly did not take of them.  Because of my lack of knowledge, I faild both of these two fragile creatures.  And because of my inconsistence, I failed to create my dream backyard, reading books, and finished the drawings I want to make.   My failure is very evenly distributed on my unrealistic knowledge of practicing things and failed to do the follow up consistently.   I feel something inside I don't know how to say it.  It makes me very steamy, maybe it's because of the temperature.  It's really hot recently!  I don't know, I just feel weird.  Something boiling inside, make me very ancious.  I watch every movement myself make.  And I just can't escape the temptation.  I feel I want something to fall into, I know there's a house full of people whom I could fall on them.  But I don't know.  I want something else.  Now I feel I am being to greedy.  I feel w
