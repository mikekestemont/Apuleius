 know  I ate a lot of bacon. The horse in front of me farted a lot though.    We also went down to the lake and swam around, and checked out bikinis, and suntanned, and tried to catch turtles. Cullen's dad (who came to Mather for 60 years straight!) told us the technique. When the turtles get close to the edge, close enough to dive to, you jump off the shore and try to smack the turtle. Then they'll pull into their shell and just float, and you can grab 'em. I tried this twice. I fell just an inch short the first time and he swam away. The second time he swam away just as I came down but I just brought my hands down hard and smacked him like 6 inches below the surface. Of course I also smacked my belly and face. And he got away anyway. It was a lot of fun though.   We also went to these Indian locations, where there are still small arowheads and flakes from their creation. We hunted a total of about two and a half hours over the trip, and we got six arrowheads.   We also went down to dirt roads and I learned how to drive. Well, it was really really intuitive so basically I learned how for about one minute then drove for about an hour.    Around the house, when we had nothing to do outside, we would usually sit around and talk and make as many yo momma jokes as possible. Or we would eat. Or sleep. While Cullen slept, since I can't really nap, I worked on my cardhouse skills. I invented a new kind called a labrynth. My largest was 7x7 squares.   Cullen brought his CO 2  pellet gun so we also shot that when we were bored.   Early in the morning we went fishing. Ken, Cullen, and I each caught a fish over the three times we went. Sometimes Ken's other friend Roggy would come with his kid. Roggy was kickass. He was a lawyer too, but also a drummer for a bunch of bands. I got a whoel bunch of photos of the river we fished at so I will post those on deviant urlLink ART .   At night we would go down to the lodge and get cokes from the bar and shoot pool. It was a great time.
Right now I am bouncing around the room in just jeans to Black Dog by Led Zeppelin, while chewing Orbit gum. I'm back, bitches!   Let me cover my adventure at the  urlLink Powell Brothers Offense-Defense Lacrosse Camp . It was quite interesting playing on the same team as quite possibly the best lacrosse player of all time.   As part of the camp I was given a free  urlLink Harrow lacrosse shaft  that has become my personal weapon. Christened the Beating Stick.   I also recieved a shirt signed by the brothers as part of the camp. Picture coming soon. Unfortunately, no pictures from that trip.   There was a one day layover between that and my Mather t
