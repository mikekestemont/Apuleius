is utter BS.  I can waste my life away sitting in a corner of a bar smiling at cute guys.  I would rather be playing on the field than on the sidelines.          That said...I do believe that guys like girls who obey by "The Rules".  Guys say that if a girl didn't call them back or played hard to get then they would just walk away but I believe this is a lie.  General guy behavior has proven that they like the drama.  Case in point, a certain suitor has called me recently and I, foolishly, called him back within 3 hours of every call instead of playing games and waiting the requisite 24 hours.  Needless to say...I have still NOT gone on a date with this individual.  I think he didn't like my forward-ness!  I should have followed Rule #5 "Don't Call Him and Rarely Return His Calls"  Thoughts?

Why Must They Be So Difficult???
Thanks to everyone who made book club so much fun last night!  We really should get together before school to do margaritas again.  Maybe Jamie can teach us how to make the perfect margarita after she goes to that party on Friday.            I understand that today can't be as blog-tastic as yesterday due to some really low billable hours yesterday that we must now make up but I just wanted to say Hi on this beautiful Thursday!          And to Erin -- "Vinnie Testiverte"
Hey everyone.  This is an invite to discuss either movie characters or celebrities that get us hot and bothered (see previous post re Jude Law, Ethan Hawke and Lloyd Dobler) or on the other hand, why we can't stand or understand men.  I know the last one seems pretty ridiculous but why not?  I'm in the mood.          I would like to start by mentioning Carl from Love Actually.  I have no idea what his real name is but he has h-o-t-t-o-g-o in that movie!  In addition, I can't understand men who give mixed signals.  Either stick with the cutsie shit or play the asshole card...you can't have it both ways
So Laura's fun-filled family vacation isn't so fun anymore and it isn't just because her family is driving her nuts.  Alex just became a class 2 hurricane and is bombarding her at Cape Hatteras.  She texted me 5 times last night giving me specific instructions on what to do if she doesn't make it back.  A little morbid in reality.  I have noticed that she hasn't mentioned her new Nine West shoes yet so I am assuming I get those (score!).  I am also hoping for her Ralph Lauren pillows but she might have willed those to someone else at this p
