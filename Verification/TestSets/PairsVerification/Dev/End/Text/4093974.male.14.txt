Flow Chart. 1. I stop eating and work out way more. 2. Still fat, and hating being annorexic cus fat kids like to eat 3. Best shape of my life, I'm in shape, and losing a bunch of weight, and maybe even have a gf. 4. I'm the size of Lisa and David Hopper, but still feeling good. 5. I'm dangerously malnutritioned, and then I die.  I think that 3 and 4 would make being anorexic worth it, but then I wouldn't get to eat, and I like to eat (it's pretty obvious, isn't it?)  I watched Predator last night it was pretty sweet. It's about Arnold Schw...I'm not even gonna try, goes into this jungle type of place with his army guys to rescue hostages, and they kill all the bad guys, but then they get hunted by the Predator, which is this crazy alien monster. It chases them on there way to this helicoptor and it's invisible and gets everyone but Arnold and this one girl. It's cool how it kills people it exploded one guys head, and exploded this other guys stomach, and is really sweet. Arnold eventually sets up a bunch of booby traps and finally kills it, and then it explodes like an atomic bomb, but somehow Arnold is ok, and he escapes and meets the girl at the helicoptor. I'd say it's pretty good for an Arnold movie, it's no Oscar Winner but it had lots of action and cool explosions, so I guess it did what it was supposed to do.  I've been watching the Olympics boxing religiously it's so great. I love the amaetur scoring, where it's a point for every clean hit in the head or body, it rewards players for being a good boxer, not for cheap blows and knock out punches like in the pros. Some of the really light classes are boring, but middle weight and up is a lot of fun to watch. Tennis is ok too, but they don't have as many of the top players because they are so tired from all of the tournaments they've been in this year. And basketball just plain sucks, none of the good players want to be in the Olympics cus they're too tired from the season, and then there's Kobe with his extra-marital shennanigans which keep him in the  court room, instead of the basketball court. Some of the girls gymnastic people are hot, but they are so muscly, it's intimidating.  I also saw some of the woman's weight lifting, and the ones with short hair could have passed for men, I swear to god, but there was this really funny section of fans from thailand that had really weird clothes and stuff and they were cheering like it was a real sport.  That's about all for today, and everyone listen to led zeppelin cus they are the bomb, and my new favorite band. Listen to Immigrant Song, Black Dog, Kashmir, and of course Stairway to Heaven, cus those are my favorites, and they totally kick ass.OK that's i
