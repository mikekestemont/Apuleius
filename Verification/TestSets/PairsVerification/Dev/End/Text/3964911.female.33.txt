on the first text use of their name but don’t put it in the possessive because that violates the brand identity." I guess, in fact, that I’m a bit of the Trademark Police threatening people with going to the Copyright Jail if they don’t follow all the rules, even the ones the clients make up themselves.   In my private life, though, I am a "closet writer" and like any of the millions of closet writers in the world, I dream the simple dream of publishing, of acclaim, of recognition, of—in short—a  urlLink MacArthur Fellowship . And as such a lowly closet writer, I wonder what my interest in the creative commons should be. Would I put a story in this pasture? What would happen to it? What will grow if this field is paved over? So I enter into this blog, Jerome’s Army, with fellow LEEPers to see what happen in this place.  &nbsp;  How to begin? Not really knowing what to do or what was here,&nbsp;I&nbsp;looked to see what other people were creating. After some Internet bumping around, I found these two sites:  urlLink newyorkish.com  and  urlLink evolutionofart.modblog.com .  &nbsp;  Check them out. One thing that struck&nbsp;me was the  support  the environment seemed to offer these creators. But enough from me for now—tell me what you think!
and salutations fellow creative, brilliant, sexy LEEPers and classmates. How goes it?
this is just a test. yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.
I haven't thought about posting here since the class ended over a week ago. I haven't thought about librarianship and its issues. I question myself, do I really care about these things- copyright perpetuity, software filters on public access pcs, electronic publishing? I look around the archives in which I work and realize that these issues do not exist here. Meaning, really, that no one discusses them. It reminds me of Freire's culture of silence. But I think its more of a culture of apathy for the whole, interest for the sole, for one's own patch of earth. (Dare I say the dismantling of the public sphere for the glory of the economy?)  So do I care enough to keep the updates on the DMCA coming into my email box? Do I care enough to make myself care when those around me could care less? I feel like the issues have moved on to someone else. The intensity of the class fueled my interest, but I could not sustain it when pushed out into the 'real' world. The 'real' world of instant pleasure, pain killers, multi-media getaways...where issues are exhibited not dissected. some soma and feelies please...  [But that's not fair either. Some people care on the outside. The few.]  Now I await the fall semester to give me my fuel. I wait for other LEEPers to talk to about these things that even as I write I forget about. (Symptom of the fall from pinnacle to nadir?) This murkiness.  What is this blog about?  I thought it meant something, to someone, to futures, and presence.    Write and answer and feel and say and see what may c
