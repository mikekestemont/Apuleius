you are? I know what a bad person you are. To apologize is human; to forgive is divine. Or something like that. Anyways, fuck you, it's gonna take time for you to be my friend again. I'm only human. I want you back, but thanks to you and Alex, I have major trust and closeness problems, so it's gonna take time.  " Is there anything else you should throw at me now? ": I'm not throwing anything. I'm telling the truth. I'm showing you what a bitch you've been. Don't pretend to be my friend. You don't mean it.  " And don't feel bad, please .": Don't tell me how to feel.  " I miss you, just so you know that .": Really? Funny, doesn't show.   I feel like I do everything for our relationship, but now I've lost faith. I've lost faith in you, and you've demolished my trust. So why don't you do something for once? Why don't you pick up the pieces and try to make sense of them, instead of just shoving them under the rug? I don't expect you to change. I just kind of hoped that you might care enough about our friendship to make an effort.  Excuse me, I have to scream.  *Jeopardy theme music* Ahhhh, much better.   Thank you, David. For loving me and sticking up for me when no one else would. Thank you, Allison. For being proud of me and giving me the courage to find myself and just be that. I love you guys so much. I could never ask for better friends.
Damn. Well, I HAD just written a bit of my first blog, but then my computer decided it'd had enough of being nice to me for one day and randomly shut down. I think it might be PMSing.  As I had originally typed though- I have a blog! I wonder who came up with that term anyways? Blog. Sounds like something you do when you've had a little too much to drink...  Anywho. I take my driver's test tomorrow. I'm super nervous. I'm not a horrible driver, but I'm not a wonderful one, either. It should be okay, though. As long as they don't disqualify me for having a crack in my windshield. I mean, insurance doesn't even cover the cost of replacing a windshield if the crack is less than the size of a quarter. Too bad mine's the size of Rhode Island.  I wonder why people always reference size to Rhode Island? Maybe because it's so versitile. Think about it: if you're talking about something small, you can say that it's as small as Rhode Island because it's such a small state. But, if you're talking about something big, you can say it's as big as Rhode Island because it's a state as compared to maybe a house or something like that. Cool.  Well I've already got things to write about for my next blog (can't write about them here because it's such an unrelated and major topic for me). So, this is.. me. ....Signing o
