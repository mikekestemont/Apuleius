  Surprises. Good ones.  The sound of the piano. So relaxing.   The feeling after a good workout. Like I've accomplished something really important.  The guys at the gym. Two words: Drop dead gorgoeous... Ooopppss, ditzy me. ahaks! :P  Happy endings, in movies, books, songs..  Boeing 747. Touchdown at KLIA. Hugs with mom and dad. Worth the 13-hour flight, the sickness (i CAN'T stand the smell of plane food. i have to sleep the whole journey or i'd be sick) and the jet-lag afterwards.   Bouquet of fresh lillies. I can sit and smell them all day.   The Crush.  KL. Can't wait to be back here for good. I'm still in KL, but I'm homesick already. Pathetic. :P  Tempe goreng. Don't laugh. I'm just being myself here. I even bring some back to the UK every summer. Everytime without fail.   New York City. I want to go there someday. Hopefully in the near future. Anyone up for it? and don't mind a drama queen tagging along? tee hee...  Roller coasters. One of the coolest things on earth.  Falling in love, I guess. It's such a beautiful feeling, don't you think? When you start to get to know that person inside out. And noticing things that you did not notice before. Kinda like an adventure. :)  White on white on white. White room, white walls, white sofas, white everything. SO clean.  F.R.I.E.N.D.S. I'm a fan-atic. Am collecting all their dvds. I watch it everytime I feel down. Laughing at their jokes make me forget my problems for a while. I don't care, call me a loser. It helps me through those bad times. :)  Daffodils. Very nice yellow.  TGV's caramel popcorn. Sinful stuff.   Romance.  Babies' chuckles.
Been away since Friday. Moved to new house on Saturday. Modem at home is making some sort of a problem. Bored to death now. Using dad's computer at his office. One word: S.L.O.W.  Went out with some friends yesterday. A lot of eventful things happened. Saw ex with his new prize in hand. A friend (actually, two..) said I'm fat. Was involved in an accident. You get the drift, no? Bad day.  Went to PJ Police Station after lunch time to make a police report. Was there for 3 hours, and I still have to go at 8 pm later for them to take some pictures of my car. How I look forward to that. Policemen scare me. I don't know why. One of them asked me to have dinner with him. After which he told me about his daughter. Riiiighhtt..One word: Poyo.  Tomorrow, will be having a minor surgery with the dentist. Have to take out my wisdom tooth, as it is 'crowding' my other teeth. No more picket fence teeth. I'm a bit of a perfectionist (a neurotic obsessive person more like it..), so might think of having braces to straighten my lower teeth. I heard that the surgery will be painful. Weeee..  Oh well.. I don't know the next time I'll blog. Flight is on the 11th. Might be after I've arrived the UK. Take care p
