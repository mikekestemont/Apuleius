find me a woman first.  ;o)  Apparently, as H2O pointed out, my picture didn't get posted as I had planned.  Screw it!  It doesn't matter anyway.  Suffice it to say that the meeting was pretty damn boring.  And as my buddy Wojtek says, "it was like a 'czeski film.'"  (like "it's all Greek to me.")  So I saw "Super Size Me" yesterday and man was it good.  I'll NEVER eat MacDonald's again!  (Well, maybe from time to time...)  But never for a month straight!!!  Tomorrow is the opening day of "Fahrenheit 9/11" in France and I plan on going to see it, too.  Just great, two films that make the States look bad...Oh well, I guess we all have our downfalls.  So Kerry-Edwards, eh?  I sure hope Bush and friends don't get "re-elected."  They have done too much to make us look bad throughout the world.  But there isn't much anti-Americanism here in France, which was a pleasant surprise.  The media makes it always sound worse that it really is, you know?    Okay, I guess I'll sign off for now.  Remember to look for me on the sidelines of the Tour de France on Sunday, July 18th...if you guys are watching the Tour de France...on Outdoor Life Network...if that exists in Baton Rouge...or if you even care...okay, I'll shut up now.  LeCastor  p.s.  Badger, Badger, Badger, Badger, Aaaahhh, it's a snake...
Right? After all of the planning, after all of the shuffling, after all of this time, Tracy and Brandon wound up getting married with only a coupel fo days notice AND Tracy still had to work about two-thirds of her shift! That very much sucks. It didn't cross my mind that there was no one to substitute her shift. Why couldn't Ben do it?   And who is in Sunday morning? Sheesh....   I hope it all went well.
So I'm trying to post a picture of me at a meeting with the European Commission and other "important" people.  Let's hope it works...
After midnight tonight there'll be a meteor shower :)
this game is very hard
Hey ya'll,  I just got back from a week-long vacation in Switzerland.  I found the countryside absolutely gorgeous and the people just as nice, if not nicer.  Zurich was fantastic and Schwytz was very quaint.  Geneva, on the other hand, was not the highlight of the week.  I was propositioned by a prostitute and realized that I was in the "quartier chaud" of the city--aka, the red light district.  Whoops!  One week left of my internship.  My report is almost finished and my bags are practically packed and ready to be taken to the train station.  I'll be in Paris on Friday afternoon and then it's off to Ireland on the 17th.  I'll finally be back in the US on the 25th of August.    I've applied for a good job in Madison.  Won't know anything for a few days...or a week even.  But it pays well and it'd be a good step in starting my career.  We'll see what happens.  I'll fill you in as soon as I know a
