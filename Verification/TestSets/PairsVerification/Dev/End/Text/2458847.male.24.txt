free time and no one to be cooler than has given me the opportunity to really appreciate what he does. Worth checking out!
The War, Iraq, Bush, etc.   Quick rant: Though I would not describe myself as a "liberal" and in no way subscribe to the "liberal agenda" in America, I have to say that I find the current occupation of Iraq and the actions of our president to be disgraceful and thoroughy dishonest. To many, I'm just pointing out the obvious, but this is my rant so I can be as obvious as I want. More obvious facts:   -The greatest success of our president has been in making a connection between the events of 9/11 and the former Iraqi government, a connection which does not exist.   -Stemming from this lie was the lie that WMDs are in Iraq and are an imminent threat to world stability. Based on this second lie, a justification for invading Iraq was manufactured and sold to the American people.  - The American people, incidentally, have the memory capacity of goldfish...as a majority of Americans continue to support this war even though the two lies which provided the only justification for war have been exposed.  -Between 8 and 10 thousand innocent lives have been lost in Iraq as a result of our invasion. About 3 times as many as were lost in the 9/11 attacks. Innocent life is innocent life, no matter how you slice it. It's all valuable. So, based on two lies and a vague notion of "justice" we were sold a plan of action which resulted in more innocent bloodshed than the attack which prompted any US action. Despite this, nothing has been accomplished to bring real justice for the 3,000 victims of 9/11. Instead, we're hated even more by the world which will only result in more attacks.  -What the hell are we doing supporting the Zionists in Israel? That's half our problem, but that's obvious.  - We have become an Empire, straying far from the original concept of Republic. Get out your 10th grade history books....now....what happens to all Empires?  - Following Septemeber 11th we had the  urlLink support of the whole  world. For the first time in decades people sympathized with the United States. Bush took that sympathy, possibly our last chance at building solid relations with the world community, and destroyed it. Within two years, we have become more hated than at any other time in history.   - We need a new president, but Kerry is nothing more than Bush"light", and a third party candidate will not be elected. Some may argue that Bush is pro-life, pro-religion, etc. These are all good things. I say this is should be a secondary consideration at this point in choosing a president. The fate of our nation is in the balance at this point. The hatred around the globe that is felt for us must be our primary concern. We've gotta fix that...quick. Besides, Bush will never push to overturn Roe V. Wade, as it would damage his career too much.   My t
