the movie when I watch it.  Every scene regardless if it a good scene or if it makes a telling point, in the back of my head will be "is this bullshit?".  I guess what I think matters little as I suppose most people, who see the movie, will sadly swallow Moore's claims.  Nonetheless, I give Moore credit for his latest movie.  He knows the average American is highly uneducated on foreign policy and lazy; thus, most of the liberally oriented people who actually see his movie will accept his version of the facts wholeheartedly.  He wants to affect the election as he has so frequently claimed. What better way then releasing for intents and purposes a anti-Bush propaganda piece that he has characterized as "political satire" in the guise of a documentary.  I also have heard that Moore is reposting aticles on his own website but editing comments that mention his critics.   Maybe I'll check that out and get back to that one later.  (edited:  I checked, yes he did edit out references to the two websites listed at the bottom of this post.  My response: lame, the article is praising him too, very sad.  )  That is pretty sad.  I have enabled comments, so feel free to chime in.    Some places of interest I found   urlLink moorewatch   urlLink moorelies
Vindicated by the Homeland Security Department, now when I recommend  urlLink mozilla  as an alternative to the craptacular internet explorer, I can buttress my claim with government backing.
With my poorly completed media law final turned in and finished, i have the time to make a post or two.  John Kerry joke of the Day:  What's John Kerry's favorite shoe?.....   The flip-flop
What an interesting way to start my day, provided link to the story for those interested.  "A dispute over clothes and a  video game system  between a young woman and a squatter in her grandparents' house apparently sparked the vicious beating and stabbing murders of six people whose bodies were found late last week in a blood-spattered home, police said."  I am currently hanging out in D.C. with my illustrious girlfriend. I managed to get out of the apartment today before noon. Yeay for jack and mediocre work ethic. I cannot fail to mention the current loaner car my GF is sporting right now, a beater 88 jag. She gets her new car sometime today. The jag is suffering from classic British build quality syndrome. The list of malfunctions.... (drum roll) 3 out of 4 door handles do not work from the outside, AC does not work, the brake pressure is low, trunk does not open through either the internal release or use of the key, alignment is off, wheel cover/lock is missing, gas cap does not close, sun roof does not function properly, trip computer has failed completely, the car vibrates in reverse gear, and no cup holders (i know that is not a malfunction but i spilled my coffee and that lack of holders is plain stupid). I am sure I'm missing something, but I've only driven it t
