place until it closed. Apparently they didn't have anywhere to stay that night, they all ended up crashing at my place. It was all kinds of crazy. sometime during the night...morning actually, I woke to go to the bathroom and found my friend's brother who got completely wasted last night bare-assed sleeping the the floor. It was hilarious. oh wait a night.     11/7/04 12:15 AM Jennifurry Liangus  YES! my television is no longer on the floor. I picked up my new tv stand today from crate and barrel...I almost threw out my back bringing it up my stairs and putting it together and then lifting my heavy ass tv to put on top of it, but it was well worth it. soon, shelves...aren't you guys excited as much as I am! ha :)     5/7/04 2:55 AM Jennifurry Liangus  boys with tattoos. yup. Happy Fifth of JULY everyone!!!!   Went to Black and White yesterday with Em, ran into Marie there. she was with her coworker, Jeremy and his friend Peter. He's cool.   22/6/04 8:35 PM   mystery of the rest of thursday night is solved. According to my friend Bryan, we walked out of the bar, he wanted to put me in a cab, but I told him I'd walk. So I did walk, but to another bar to visit with my friend Al. My friend Mike sitting at the end of the bar asked if I was ok, but all I did was star at him and finally asked for Al. Now, Al said I was uber fucked up. He asked if I wanted a drink, I replied in a low hoarse voice "water." And so he walked me out and put me in a cab. he claims when he opened the door I "fell into the cab" ahhh well. My thursday night story is thus concluded.     18/6/04 10:25 PM   Today was rough. I think I need to take a break from the drinking of whisky. The three hours I spent at work this morning consisted of me vomiting in the bathroom. And then I left and proceeded to vomit more at home. This is added to the vomiting out the window of the cab I was in last night, even after telling the driver (who was on his cell I think)to stop talking or he was gonna make me throw up. I also managed to black out at one point in the night. I think I need to work on that a bit.   6/6/04 6:20 PM  Speaking of more postings. I woke up at 3pm today. I stayed out drinking way past my bedtime. I went to a housewarming around 11, ditched that party to go to the bar around 1:30. It was fucking crowded. I hate Saturday night crowds. good thing my friend Ethan let me sit behind the bar to get away from all the crazy folk. It was another whisky night. got home around 4:30am. whoo. what a night. now i'm tired and hungry. the sopranos are on later tonight and that's about it. what a production w
