to attend and more music to discover.
my neck is sore. i have a bruise on my left knee as well as a slightly larger one on my right knee. i also have finger-like bruises on my mid-left thigh. well, what can i say? papa roach put on a great show. i got to the front and i totally felt the music. i love their lyrics. papa roach brings back some really bad times in my life and i am glad i didn't fall apart when i heard them. i was fine until the last song, last resort. kenki noticed that i was spacing out.  i wanted to type a super long blog today but i have to actually get out of this office. i need to pick up my niece at her softball game.  i am going to go home and watch "airplane!" and stretch out. no gym today. tomorrow i will hang with bridie and sabo cat. saturday i will be getting my drugs in TJ and then off to del mar to bet on the horsies and see cake again. yay.  by the way, i took this picture from the paparoach website. isn't jerry cute? i got to stand in front of him during the whole show, get his guitar pic, his autograph, and chat with him outside the Roxy and of course hug him.

headed to the gym in about half an hour or so. my workouts have been pretty good lately. yesterday i saw priscilla r. i smoothly turned to my right and moved across the gym in order to avoid her. i really hate running into people from high school. luckily she didn't see me.  tonight is the show at the roxy. it should be fun. i'll be headed to sunset around 4 to meet up with kenki. bridie won't be going to the show. papa roach brings back some awful times in my life. hopefully the music doesn't bring me down like that time with metallica when "one" hit me. i am currently running on three hours of sleep, it won't be long now until i kill over. i don't mind sleeping in the gutters of sunset as long as i get to sleep.  damnit, i forgot my vitapills for the day. oh well, i have to go home to change anyways.
i had a great workout late last night, i didn't get home until well after midnight. i'll spend a few hours online today then head to the gym again.  at the funeral party, i got a glimpse into what i'll be doing for my friends. i think our snake dance will evolve into a mosh pit. that would be most fun. i also saw the village, i liked it.  i signed off of friendster. that website seriously sucks ass. i prefer myspace.com better. i am surprised i am not addicted to that site as of y
