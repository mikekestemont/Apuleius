bangkok (using a bangkok SIM card); mind you local to local eh. Also bad reception. Our conversation went like this.  Me : Hey, how are you? It's Brendan.  Eric: I'm good thank you.  Me: Oh just called to see how you were and hope you are doing well  Eric: I'm okie. Just hungry and going to meet sister bemas for lunch soon He has sms me a lot and i didn't reply him.  Me: Did u by chance get my 2 emails? Not sure if you replied as my work email sometimes cannot work as people have emailed me and it bounced.  Eric: Yes I did get your 2 emails thank you. The first one and the second one with the picture link. I saw the pictures. They came out very nicely. And your second email ended asking me I was an email person. Sorry, as I've been busy. No time to reply. Will try reply soon.   Me: Oh i see...  Eric: So what are your plans today?  Me: Errm nothing much. Probably just laze at home.  Eric: I see  Me: I may be heading up to bangkok with another bunch of friends soon, August. Mid august I think.  Eric: Oh okie. You can drop me a line and we could catch up.  Me: Yes. Shouldn't be a problem.  Eric: So how's work?  Me: Oh well, boss is coming back soon. Got settled with the admin which has been dragged for a while.  Eric: Yeah, read that in your second email. You wrote that.  Me: Anyway, I guess the reception is killing our conversation.  Eric: Yes, let's communicate via email or we speak in person,it's better this way.  Me: Okie you take care, Ciao  Eric: Thanks for calling and talk soon. Bye   After going through the conversation. Eric has not give me any hope of what may happen with him. But just gave me a nice ending to what I've been through. I misunderstood him twice (the last time was the SMS and this time with regards to the emailing). Eric is just like Mr Big in SATC. He is strange and he does things accordingly to his time. I'm not sure if I'm a masochist. But it seems the guys I like are seriously strange. Weird guys. Silent brooding guys are attractive to me haha I am damn sure this guy will forget replying my email. No more expectations. Now, I will learn to love myself more (which have been quite successful so far). Loving myself is the best. If I don't lick my own wounds, who would?  Going to Bangkok. My itinerary with Eric would be simply just better the second round. NO, am not doing the sucidal thing. When my mind is tuned to the just *uck mode, I won't get emotional. It's as simple as that. Well, you think I'm cold. But I think I need to protect myself more than anything else now.  P.S. Clif (that Qantas Flight Attendant) broke up with his boyfriend yesterday. Yes, that's a miracle. Don't worry, not interested in him h
