sandwich.  it was tasty, and the bread was good, but it was not ideal and the last bite fell apart in my hand.  rebuilding at that point in the process was quite a hassle, and it prevented me from properly savoring the end of my meal.  maybe i'll go lie down.  i guess i could smoke a cigarette, but that really doesn't sound too appealing.  here's what i'll do...i'll drink a big glass of water.  i guess i could just eat.  fuck it, i'm gonna eat.
sweet good lord i wish i could eat a chicken thigh in the car without any problems.  you get a two piece dark meat meal, you don't fuck aroud with sides, and of course you get two thighs instead of the thigh and leg.  but life...life is cruel to a driving gourmand, especially one who won't accept a lesser piece of the bird.  anyone who knows chicken knows to go straight for the thighs.  the problem arises when one can't keep their mitts of the meat.  you need to improvise, and you end up getting all filthed up.  i'm fucking so fucking goddamn hungry.
i went borders trying to indulge my crush with larger pictures, but the only books they had were several kid's books and one by the  urlLink archaeological investigators  who may or may not have found her shoe.  what i wanted was some semi unseemly biography with lots of unconvincing tales from folks who claiming to have poked her.  i wanted one of those books with the twenty pages of glossies in the middle; candids of her entering and exiting restaurants with an unconvincing smile, uncomfortable in an evening dress.  lots of appealing mia farrowness.  what i got was a picture of her reconstructed skull.  the book right next to that one, however, was pretty good.  i ended up reading about 92 pages right there in the store.  it's another lost at sea sort of deal, and while the prose may seem irresponsibly florid at times,  urlLink this guy  has probably earned his indulgences.  i think i'm going to go back and read more.  but first i'll have to find some pants.
urlLink amelia earhart  sure did look a lot like mia farrow, and she was five seven.  that is fantastic.  i guess they are pretty sure now about what happened.  she and noonan landed on gardner island, lived off a cache of goods from a shipwreck for a while, then just wasted away.  the people who eventually populated the place had all sorts of trinkets made from pieces of airplane metal.  i mean, if you gotta go...in the grand scheme of things it's not such a bad way.  i mean with the romance and notoriety and such, not so much the wasting away.  that would be pretty shitty.  i'm sure one would probably slip into some kind of delerium, and apparently they had booze from the shipwreck, but still, given the choice of a means for physical death, exposure would be low on my list.  i wonder if she and noonan got it o
