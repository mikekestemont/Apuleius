     It’s not that I don’t believe that it’s nice to believe in something – I’m just not sure that something would want to believe in me. I’m not worthy of a better life, I kinda blew those chances already, and I deserve to be without lasting hope. It’s okay to hope for better for my kids, for my friends – but, for me, it hurts too much to ask for more...     That familiar internal struggle between hope and surrender, belief and apathy – how many times has each of us tried to find a sense of balance when our emotional compass is ‘out of whack’ with the reality we see / feel around us? How to escape that sense of fatalistic futility, the one that is loosely based on past experience but more solidly built as a wall to prevent future disappointments...     Even if I actually met someone, someone nice, someone who wanted to be with me, it wouldn’t last – it never does. He’d get sick of me, the sweetness would fade, and he’d just get more and more annoyed at me (and me at him) until he left. Maybe that’s why I chose to believe in a guy who was on Earth 2000 years ago – at least His words and actions stood the test of time... All the men in this world I live in have simply failed to defend me, or be indignant at what others have put me through, broken promises to protect me, love me, and never turn their back on me...    Tears pricked at the edges of her frown, their needles of frustration reminding her of the words of a hard rock song, where the man harshly proclaims how he will hurt the guy who hurt his woman / daughter / sister, and she wonders why that is what she wanted all these years. Her thoughts turn to Him, His gentle hands reaching out for her, offering not retribution but eternal love. Somehow she had momentarily lost the strength to lift her gaze to meet His, as instead she tried to become like the grey clouds hanging low across the horizon, marring what had started out as a light-hearted, sunny winter’s day.   It’s not about ‘Me’ – It’s about Him, what He wants me to be, what He has already given me, the blessings I take for granted every day, letting go of my own egoistic thoughts and trusting in Him with all my life, no more holding back.    Feeling the weight shift from off of her shoulders, she quickened her pace, deciding to remain in the here and now, where she belonged... And, yes, she got through her immediate task, returning with the backpack over-full yet with the hint of a smile dancing on her face even as a light rain began to fall - and I can assure you that even before she arrived at her destination, a rainbow arched above the street ahead, guiding her  home ...
