bee...its ridiculous what draconian training regimens they go through to win this prize.  Well, this is only the beginning... stay tune for more utter nonsense!
So JJ, RH, and I went on a trip to my old stomping grounds, Philadelphia. Its amazing how in college you never are aware of your surrounding city/town particularly at Penn. where all the good times are on campus. Be that as it may, I felt like a tourist in a city where I lived for four years. It was nice to go away and loosen up...I've had a lot on my mind these few weeks and I dare say I needed a vacation. The first day, we walked around mid town going shopping and checking out the reading market terminal. I made the early mistake of drinking some milk products from dunkin donuts- as a consequence my stomach was full of effervescence like you wouldn't believe so I could not conjure up the hunger to eat anything at the market and believe me, there was plenty to eat... Those amish can sure make apple dumplings. After the terminal, the three of us went on a stroll in the shopping district. I don't know if it was the 80+degree weather or carrying RH through it but JJ and I were spent. Spent to the point of retiring at 230PM. We were ready to call it a day! The next day was spent at the Franklin Science Institute looking at the Titanic exhibit which I recommend. I felt like Leonardo&nbsp; Decaprio stowing away in the first class section though I must say, I think my wife is much better looking than Kate Winslett...They even had a replica of the bannister seen the film. In contrast it was raining like crazy. After picking up some greasy cheesesteaks, it was time to return home for much need rest...from the vacation!

Man, it's been a hectic 2 weeks. Sorry, its taken so long to update my blog but my life is my work these days. Which for the most part is not a bad thing if it wasn't for seeing my wife and child less. RHJ is growing up so fast, I can actually feel her growing in my hands...oh wait that's her pooping. She's definitely filling out though. She has that look all babies get- you know, the michilen man look with the beefy legs and arms. She's starting to raise her head now and looking around and smiling everytime you smile at her...well most of the time. I think fatherhood has changed me alot- which I expected. I don't care that I'm working my ass off because in the end I'm working for my family and not for myself. It only takes a glimpse at the picture of my daughter on my desk to remind myself of this. Anyway, this weekend I'll be getting a well deserved rest. JJ, RH, and I are going to Philadelphia, my old college stomping grounds to get some cheesesteak and frolic in the Philadelphia Museum of Art.&nbsp; Should be f
