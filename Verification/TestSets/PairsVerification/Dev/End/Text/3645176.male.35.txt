death of many of the world's terrorists. Terrorists who would kill shameless people like you just as fast as they would a kind one.  I will have to say that I get a kick out of watching you on Fox in much the same way I get a kick out of watching shows on the KKK and the Nazis. Crass people spouting their elitist viewsâ€¦people with no right to claim superiority over anyone. What makes this so entertaining is that you think you are the smart ones. A fool that knows he's a fool is just a fool, but a fool that thinks he's the smart one...well, that's comedy.   Also, reading your hate mail from other fox viewers is quite entertaining. It is the labeling of your detractors as some kind of illiterate right-wing Bush brigade that is brainwashed by Fox News that shows your true colors. As people like yourself tend to do, you throw a label on people in order to dehumanize and attack them, often turning one "group" against another. I'd bet that many who write to you have no party affiliation and no history of voting. Many may not be able to find Iraq on a map, but that's some of them. Some are Republicans, some are Democrats and some are people who just don't like you because of the distasteful things you say.  You need help Ted, help to work through your issues, but not from me. It's going to take someone with a hell of lot of alphabet soup after their name to get you to open up and set your tortured soul free.    Daniel
June 16, 2004  Paul Stafford, Winemaker Turning Leaf Vineyards P.O. Box 1130 Modesto, California 95353   Dear Mr. Stafford,  I am writing to thank you and the entire Turning Leaf organization for consistently making great wines at a great price, as well as making them widely available. Over the last eight months my wife and I have had our first child and I quit my job to start my own business. Admittedly, times have been a bit tighter here than they once were, but thankfully one thing has not changed, I am still able to enjoy my favorite wines.  Even before life in the Smith household changed so dramatically, Turning Leaf California Merlot and California Cabernet Sauvignon were favored for their balance, their body and the consistency of these elements from bottle to bottle. Especially now, I am grateful for the value of Turning Leaf wines because I would not want to drink a bad bottle of wine at any price. I have found your wines to be better than many others, others often at three or four times the price.  Please make sure that everyone at the vineyard knows that their efforts are greatly appreciated. For you, Mr. Stafford, I thank you for making Turning Leaf wines everything wine is supposed to be. As things go on changing here at home, I will continue to drink, to share and to gift the wines of Turning Leaf Vineyards.  Sincerely,   Daniel E. S
