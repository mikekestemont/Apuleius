the box he gave me my first birthday gift in and the inside cover said this:   Amanda is such an overwhelmingly beautiful person - inside and out. Her desire and drive to hold true to her dreams and  to grow as a person who will better live her live in a way that she will smile on when looking back is inspiring and admirable. A quality and state-of-mind that I hope rubs off on the people she encounters. A quality that I hope she never loses sight of in a world where so many are shallow and content. A quality I hope she knows I am above all and truly attracted to.   It made me cry all over again. Okay... that's all you get. It's almost 5am. Mike wants me in bed... see, now that's why I only do this once a month. It just takes too damn long. You people are greedy.   Goodnight. :)
I'm not sure where to start this post; I've tried a few different "openings", but keep deleting them.   I was lucky enough to be invited by  urlLink Jill Ackles  to the Director's Guild of America [DGA] second annual "Digital Day" convention. Check in was at 9 in the morning, and the event lasted until 9 that night.   Which created two problems: [one] I was scheduled to work at 2 to close, and since the catalog just dropped, everyone was working and no one was getting the day off... and [two] my car didn't quite make the drive out west, so Amanda and I are left with one car... and Amanda was working from 1 to close, which meant I might not have a ride home.   Long story short, I didn't care about either, I called in sick to work, and was willing to stand around for a few hours afterwards until someone could swing by and pick me up, thank God for Borders. But anyways, the event was something I will never forget. Some of the key speakers included:  urlLink David Fincher ,  urlLink Stacy Peralta ,  urlLink George Hickenlooper ,  urlLink Lionel C. Martin ,  urlLink Mark Pellington ,  urlLink Allen Daviau ,  urlLink Robert Primes , and  urlLink Nancy Schreiber .  The day went by so fast I really didn't get an opportunity to think about what was going on around me, and what I was taking from it. Even a day later, sitting here now, I'm still trying to put my finger on it. I do know the simple fact that Jill thought to invite me in the first place was very, very flattering. I'm incredibly thankful for the experience, it was good to be reminded that if you want something done, especially in this industry, you've got to be willing to do it yourself [people have implied that before... but it was nice to hear it from directors like Fincher, and Peralta].  I have a lot more I would like to write about, but I have to get ready for work now, so it will have to wait till later. Till that d
