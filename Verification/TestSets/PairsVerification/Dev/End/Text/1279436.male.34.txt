Brad Feld sparked some chatter when he posted on his site a few words on RSS investing and how  urlLink totally cool and imporant  MessageCast is to bloggers.  Even would-be beta blogger Scoble picked up the posting. . .   And of course, our nice write-up in eWeek  urlLink last week   helped spark some buzz among bloggers.

Grant Gross, a reporter for IDG News, did a story about the FCC's vote to ban (some) cell phone SPAM and called on us for reaction comment. The story appeared on several IDG sites, including PC World, InfoWorld, Computer Weekly, Network World, and the Industry Standard. It was also picked up by Yahoo News. . .  urlLink http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/pcworld/20040805/tc_pcworld/117274
I've been looking for some insight or context around the FCC's vote the other day on banning cell spam and the big hole in its restrictions. I found an interesting take on a Nokia-owned site about the Mobile Internet. . .TheFeature. This writer sounds a slight yawn over the FCC vote, points out the small victory it really is, and explains some of the nuances.  urlLink http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=100950&threshold=-1&amp;ref=2265726
Now that more details have emerged, it looks like the FCC may have forgotten something when it banned cell phone SPAM -- it left out SMS text messages. Keep an eye out for more insight on this decision as it becomes available. Here's the actual FCC press release on the vote . . .  urlLink http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-250522A3.doc
Here's an interesting take on SPAM that appeared this morning on DMNews. This pro opines the CAN-SPAM Act works just fine because its main thrust was to regulate unsolicited and unwanted email traffic, not stop it because then it would affect legitimate companies.  urlLink http://www.dmnews.com/cgi-bin/artprevbot.cgi?article_id=30008
The FCC voted Wednesday to ban unsolicited advertising to cell phones but it left open a possible loophole by leaving text messages out.  urlLink http://news.com.com/Wireless+spam+draws+regulators%27+wrath/2100-1028_3-5296649.html?part=rss&tag=5296649&amp;subj=news.1028.5
And more importantly, our no-SPAM message has supporters. . . Take this posting on a French website, with translation courtesy of Google.  RSS n'est pas du spam ! A voir...  RSS is not Spam! To see... On the other hand, the choice of format RSS is particularly judicious for two reasons: first of all, this format which wants to be universal is adapted to all the forms of media able to receive contents on line, computers, telephones mobile or PDA, for example. But especially, the RSS currently does not enter the techniques of Spam, and thus escapes the systems from fight anti-Spam, which makes it possible MessageCast to affirm that LiveMessage is ' No Spam '. A manner of affirming that as the firm does not use the same techniques as the spammeurs, its forwardings in mass are not Spam! Final, the adoption of RSS for the advertisements resembles a good way rather of circumventing the technological and legal restrictions which impose laws anti-Spam and the rules of diffusion of intrusive publicity, and to continue to submerge the Net surfers of not requested, but ' legal ' advertisements. posted by Yves Grandmontagne  Actual Link:  urlLink h
