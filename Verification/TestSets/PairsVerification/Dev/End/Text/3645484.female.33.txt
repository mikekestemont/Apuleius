and sob. I don't sense my breath, my skin or my posture. I feel only pit of me, my gut. This isn't crying. It is more than that. It is a realization, that, as a human being I am given no promise, no right, to be here. That there is unbearable sanctions that are part of being flesh and blood. It is not a maybe, but a promise. It is a humility of existence and a parallel fear of not being worthy to keep what you have been given.  And, just as quickly as it came, it ebbs away and ungrips me. The scenes on the screen change to something less familiar, less threatening. Unreal, yet undeniably etched in me.  I tell people in passing that I suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. That, as a cancer survivor, it is a latent effect. I say this in a usual, benign manner, until, a flash of the familiar hits me and I am there again. I am alone in my pain. I am thwarted into fear and I am maddened by the powerlessness. The psyche is amazing.
Some one died today. Yesterday too. I woke up and realized that I didn't know how to appreciate that people pass and leave behind legacies worthy of ritual mourning. If I think about it too much, I will be crippled. They never taught me to respect the idea of longevity being worthy of praise. They usually didn't live long enough. They never taught me that family doesn't mandate adoration, but earns it. They never showed me that people live, love and gather to support and reflect on a life that touched theirs.

Peace comes to those who are humbled by the situations they do not understand. I am incensed by this--afraid of this and if I think about too much, I may not reundo.
Spinning around in my white flannel p.j.s with the blue flowers, the Beatles bound out my anthem, you say its your birthday, well happy birthday to you I know they are singing it just for me. I hear this every year and I await it eagerly. My validation. My Dad standing by, smirking as I feverishly attack the brown shag carpet with my bare feet, twisting, turning and feeling the rhythm. Yeah, its my birthday, happy birthday to me.  Years have passed and I have had to spend this ritual alone. I sometimes play it for myself, but it is never the same. The lone Beatle, Paul, broke sanctuary of years by professing, Yeah, we were stoned. It was expected, just would rather have not heard it. It is as lonely as having to dance to it alone. The fantasy gone, the primal dance just a m
