of America. Unfortunately however this would allow American companies to be free to sue British companies for loss of profits if they tried to impose health and safety or environmental laws that according to NAFTA’s frankly bizarre definition of free trade discriminates against these companies.  Rather more worryingly, Ukip have almost identical policies to the BNP on migration and asylum; many UKIP parliamentary candidates have been former National Front or Northern League of New Britain Party activists, hence UKIP have been dubbed "the BNP with smiling faces.” I only have to point your attention to Robert Kilroy-Silk, who made horrifically stereotypical comments about Arabs describing them all as “suicide bombers, limb amputators and women repressors.”  Ukip is an unrealistic political party composed almost entirely of white middle-aged men who seem determined to try and return Britain to an imagined 1950s golden age. It's not going to happen, Britain is stong when in Europe, strong when at the heart of Europe, strong when she can speak alongside her European allies to provide a counter-balance to the lunatic US foreign policy of late.  Recently after Ukip's supposed election breakthrough (15% of the votes from an uninformed and uninterested electorate), they have vowed to 'wreck' the European parliament, so they don't just want to 'wreck' the UK by withdrawing it, they want to ruin the institution that is bringing economic, social and political benifits to the rest of the EU. Selfish? Go and play your mindless political games elseware Mr Kilroy-Silk and let the people of the EU enjoy the peace and prosperity that a stable and united Europe has brought to us.
Exams are all but over now (I have food technology and History left but they really arn't important), so the long summer has all but begun. This can only mean one thing, time for a lot of drunken parties, lounging around doing nothing in particular and eventually and very reluctently accpeting that I shall have to get a job once I begin to run out of money.  As I write this its half time in the Germany vs. Latvia match in Euro 2004, I expect I'm one of very few people in England cheering on Germany, often in a match like this the whole nation become honourary supporters of the opposition. The English have always disliked the Germans and as far as I can see always will, no doubt there are very deep physchological reasons for this none of which I can be bothered to venture into now.  Throughout the country theres a lot of rather messy upheaval regarding Europe and Britains place in the EU, something I feel quite strongly about as a person who considers himself to be 'European' rather than 'British' (this is because one of my grandparents is Irish the other German) and I feel particuarly strong ties to both these countries. I'm personally disgusted by the gains of the far right UK independence party at the European parliament elections last week for reasons I shall venture into after the second half of the football.
