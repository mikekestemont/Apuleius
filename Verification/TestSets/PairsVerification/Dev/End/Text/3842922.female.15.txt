can be. Hahah, thank you.              7# : And Dead, what's  your name?              8# : Thank you Gav darling. I know.               9# : LASTLY, SANJEEV RAJ. No thank yous here! Hahaha, I'm offended. I HAVE perfect tits. Or else why would I be giving this acceptance speech anyway? Haha!                     Oh, isn't this a bit too long? Anyway, I've gotten past the PLUMP turd. My insecurities are over. Yay! Sheesh. Lame.        Now, let me fill you in on my day.          1) Woke up at about 6.45am          2) Came up with an ingenious plan coz I did not want to go to school. I can't stay home coz Dad and Edgar were in.          3) Called Harvin at about 6.53am to ask whether I could go over and sleep. He said yes, so I just walked over. He stays like, at the next block.          4) Went over. Slept in Jeswin's room. She wasn't around, you see.          5) Woke up at about 11am.           6) Brushed my teeth, washed my face, but couldn't get a shower coz I left my things at home.          7) So lazed around. Wanted to go for breakfast, or rather, brunch. Then I came up with the perfect solution. I OFFERED TO MAKE SOME FRY UP FOR BREAKFAST! Yay! Lucky boys (Harvin and Roshen).          8) We had potatoes and onions, fried up in butter until almost crisp. And scrambled eggs (I make perfect scrambled eggs) and bread. Harvin did not have sausages or ham. So we had to make do with those. Was yum though.          9) Hanged out. Played some Playstation. Some stupid game called Grand Tourismo. Like, hell, it sucks.          10) Came back at about 1.30pm. SKipped tuition. Ta daa. Blogging my life away.          Did I mention? I was watching Sex and The City yesterday from 10pm til 2pm. Hell, it's good. Hahah! Had a ball. Learnt something new. Za Za Zsu. Which is like, butterflies in your stomach. Cute aye?
I NEED FEEDBACK.          Yesterday, I was on the phone with Jas. And he told me that his friends, the aforementioned one, the ones who were sexist, racist and shallow? He said that they said I was  PLUMP . Like, WTF?           #1 : NO BLOODY  PERSON WITH SELF RESPECT USES THAT WORD, IT'S BETTER OFF ELIMINATED FROM THE DICTIONARY.          #2 : I'M SO NOT PLUMP. I LOOK PLUMP COZ I HAVE WAAAAAY BIGGER BOOBS COMPARED TO THEM. WHICH ACCORDING TO HYON XHI, DOESN'T BEFIT MY SIZE COZ I AM PETITE, THOUGH IT'S GOOD, HAHA! JUST BECAUSE I HAVE THE ASSETS AND TENDENCY TO BECOME AN ASIAN PORN SUPERSTAR, IT DOESN'T MAKE ME PLUMP.          #3 : I'VE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THEY'RE JUST JEALOUS COZ THEY DO NOT HAVE TITS AS PERFECT AS MINE. AND THAT THEY'RE STUCK WITH BLOODY MINUS MINUS A CUP BRAS. AND THAT THEY HAVE MOOBS LIKE HYON XHI'S (MOOBS=MEN'S BOOBS). AND THAT NOBODY STARES AT THEIR NON-EXISTENT TITS.          Okay, I feel much better. Hahaha, tell me what you guys think about my size. I ain't that fat right? Right? Right? Feeling a lil pissy and annoying right n
