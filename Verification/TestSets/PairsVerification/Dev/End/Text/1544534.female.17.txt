in history. Still, it was well presented. (Though Jen was a little surprised to be referenced during the Erotica portion of the night's entertainment. "Well, if you'd like to know more about erotica, I'd talk to Jenny. . . ."   Jen: *blinkblink*  My romance novels apparently qualify me as an expert.   More later, gotta dash now.
Wow. Life after TASP. It's a different world. Very different. Less secure, broader, more frightening, but at the same time, less insurmoutable. Conquerable. Like a mountain of glass. It can be climbed, but it might shatter beneath you.  Things I've learned from TASP:  1) I am capable of second guessing myself to the point of crippling uncertainty. How many times did I want to be asked to go somewhere, and how many times did I hold back? Exactly as many times as I now regret.   2) Uncertainty is sometimes well-merited. I have lost a great deal of confidence in myself, my social abilities. Even today, among friends, I found myself listening into the silence after I cracked a joke, and inwardly cringing, thinking back to failed attempts at humor during TASP.   3) Nothing hurts more than wasted opportunity. How I wish I'd had the balls to open my mouth and sing "Foggy Dew" at Telluride Cafe. If I had, perhaps I would have made place for myself in that larger community, the greater body I never seemed to be affiliated with.   4) Keep your mouth shut. You learn more.   5) There're few pleasures like hearing other people speak your views, particularly when you know you contributed to their formation, and you aren't "recognized" as their originator. That's subversive, and that's Tremere, but it's true. It's also one of the most effective ways to contribute to a discussion if you've accidentally blown your rhetorical hand. Or if everyone knows your position. . .   6) The greatest triumph is being able to hug your enemy and realize they've become your friend. Sappy as that sounds. There was a time I was furious with Alex.  When I finally got up the guts to hug her at the end of TASP, though, it meant so much, because I knew there had been a time when we couldn't have managed it, and when she wouldn't have wanted me to or allowed it.   7) If you think you have backing for a project, act FAST. It's easy to see your support trickle away in waves and waves of votes and queries. People get bored fast, particularly voting constituents.   Other than all of that, I've come home to a mother who's neck deep in Depression/Mania. It's hard to tell, I think it's depression, though.  She's wandering around aimlessly, smoking heavily, talking to herself,  laughing  to herself, stumbling, slow, incoherent, sulky, immature. I do prefer this to Mania, I do. . . but it's scary too, in its own way. It's frightening when she's whispering to herself, mumbling to herself, staring at you all the time.   God I hate this. I hope, I hope, I hope, that I never put my children through t
