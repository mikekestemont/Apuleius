of Manhattan for several hours. When he finally returned from his exodus, he very casually said, "I'm fine. It's OK. I just understand things now. This is just proof than there is no higher power, and that goodness will never overcome evil, and that there is no valid reason to believe in anything, because the universe craves darkness and despises light. So, I'm totally OK." I found this sentiment somewhat troubling. What I love about Red Sox fans is their sense of doomed destiny; they almost want to lose, because that failure is romantic. This is far different from, say, Minnesota Vikings fans, as they always believe -- and I mean always -- that this is the year. And it never is, and it never will be.     In the near future, you can expect a few things from ,,; - a little more information about me, my background, what I hope to achieve, goals, aspirations etc. This will likely turn into a bit of a blawg and not merely a blog. For those of you unfamiliar with the word 'blawg,' I have a  urlLink link for you . I will also likely publish a treatise in which I codify exactly how I will use punctuation in and around the abbreviated form of this column's title, as, clearly, that can get a little awkward.  But seriously, I've never written on a regular basis before. Hopefully this will be more successful than any number of journals that sit in stasis on my bookshelf with one glorious entry on their first page and nothing on the rest.  On that note, I will end this first post with a little information regarding the name of this column. Up until quite recently, I was an actor. In school, while studying the Folio technique of approaching Shakespearean verse, we learned about the importance of punctuation in the text, and how you should pay close attention to every full stop, comma, colon, and  especially the semi-colon.  The punctuation acts as a kind of emotional road map--every comma winding the tension higher, every full stop releasing it. The real kicker however, is the semi-colon. This is by far the most intriguing of the punctuating symbols, and requires the most serious attention. For the semi-colon represents a  major shift  in emotion, a cataclysmic event culminating in total release of control often followed by wild and reckless emotional abandon. So, as you read the title of my column, inwardly at least, you can imagine a steady build, a push, like the feeling you get when chaotic thoughts start building in your relatively quiet mind late at night, onward and upward, growing louder, stronger and more frenetic with each comma, until finally, when you think you can't possibly withstand it any longer, all of a sudden the fog clears, the heavens open up, the sun comes out, and you tilt back your head and scream with unbridled joy -- SEMI-COLON!!  Well, that, and it happened to be the first thing that popped in my head. I'm not sure I'll keep it, r
