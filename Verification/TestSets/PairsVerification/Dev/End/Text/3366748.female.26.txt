Put it behind you, and move forward.   I am attending college and majoring in social work.  I am majoring in social work, because my main goal for the past five years has been to help children.  Virtually all of the roll models I have have degrees in social work, and have started out working as a CPS caseworker.  That position makes me nervous and there is a lot of internal conflict.  I want to always, ALWAYS do the RIGHT thing when it comes to children.  I have worked closely with CPS workers in the past, and admire them, but I don't know if I am prepared for all the intensity, the criticism, and so on.
