and stopped to check things out. There was a cool, really nice guy with dreads, and a slightly less cool(cause he wasn't so nice) guy. I bought Sobe and I got a free shirt. I had to borrow a little bungycord to bring it home, then I came back to return the bungee and got some more Sobe. This time I chose a water bottle, but it was a really cheapo one. Then I watched a Fox special and a team of midgets raced an elephant to pull a plane. Midgets increase the awesome of any show exponentially, but there were like, 44 midgets this time. And a lot of them made faces like they had fire for blood and were constipated at the same time, so it was good. Attention TV producers! Midgets = supah cool.
I try to avoid all that teenage drama that you read about, I do. I've spent most of my life hiding in my basement or in a dark arcade. I have the most fun sitting around a table with like-minded people, playing DnD or having a lan party, that kind of thing. And, it's been working for the most part, but it always seems to chase me down. For a while, it was a problem I had because I couldn't really connect with any of my friends. Later, I realized that I had the wrong friends, and started enjoying myself with new circles. However, most of them were older, and I ended up playing witness to their misadventures. Now, I feel like I ought to try and talk about it, but I honestly have no idea what to say. I play through the conversations in my head, and nothing I say sounds satisfying. I am not used to dealing with people's feelings, not at all. Hell, not even  my  feelings. I know some people who are only my friends so we can get away with insulting eachother. And I hate to say anything of the sort, but shit, life is hard.
I'm flying down to Seattle again, from Alaska, just so I can attend a gaming convention put on by webcomic artists. I have realized my full geek potential. It's gonna be great! I'm talking about PAX, of course. Penny-Arcade is super keen, and I'm gonna get to meet the creators and sit around staring at a screen for hours. According to the schedule, there will be a period around midnight where they kick everyone out for a hour or so, but after that it's back to work! I even get to play Halo2, which will also be neat. I gotta buy a fucking xbox. If anyone happens across this who is also attending, here's a fun fact: I'll probably be wearing an 3vil l33t shirt, and the rattiest fucking hat you've ever seen. Says "rugby, because" on the front of it. I love my hat, and have worn it for about six or seven years running now. It is an old hat. Maybe I should get it patched up or something before it's unwearable. P
