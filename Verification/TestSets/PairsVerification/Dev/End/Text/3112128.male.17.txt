cut back pensions for war veterans, insurance paid to soldiers killed in battle and the pay of currently serving American soldiers.      I learnt one thing- the personal side of the story. I learnt about a woman from Michigan, who's son died in Iraq. I learnt about her struggle to come to terms with the ignorance of people who believe that the war was just and necessary. I struggled to come to terms with the two recruitment officers walking around poor neighbourhoods, luring young men and women into the armed forces as though they were hunting in a butcher's store. I saw the young people turning to the armed forces in order to pay their way through college. I also witnessed a dear lady read the last letter that she received from her son, before he was killed in a Black Hawk helicopter crash. I witnessed a lot. I cried and I cheered, shuddered and gasped. Mothers sobbed for their children and the soldiers shook their heads, in disgust at their commander in chief and his self appointed presidency. There was a lot of anguish and even more anger.       Mothers, sons, politicians, friends, families, businessmen, teenagers, soldiers;  people ---one hero to unite them all in the struggle against the most potent threat against our society: blind faith. Bush's voters have it in spades.      I see more justification in invading America to liberate the Americans from Bush, than I saw justification to do likewise in Iraq. Let's fight for our freedom.
My thesis is as follows--- Censorship comes in two forms:   The suppression of information.  The encouraging of ignorance.   The first method of censorship is obvious and not often denied, but the second form of censorship is much more subtle, devious and (ironically) ignored. It is the method often employed by religious institutions and other organizations, lacking in the ability to suppress information. Sometimes, an establishment will employ both methods of censorship.  It is by euphemising and devaluing the importance of issues that ignorance can be encouraged and censorship achieved. It is almost as though the organization is 'dancing around the issue', by diverting attention and creating a facade, suggesting that the issue that is to be censored is of less importance than it truly is. This is the most aggrevating and wily form of censorship.  The most interesting form of censorship is the combination. By suppressing only select information, an issue does arise and is solved quickly and with the general impression that it is of little importance. Dealt with and over, people move on. The issue is made public and dismissed in an instance. However, without  some  issues occurring, sceptics arise. By letting minimal amounts of information be circulated about an issue, there is less chance of scepticism and more chance of general approval- a very likeable situation. Just enough for there to be an issue, though minimal enough to allow the issue to be dismissed and ignored.  Do not be ignorant and do not be afraid to question the information given. A sceptic is wise and a passionate sceptic- a h
