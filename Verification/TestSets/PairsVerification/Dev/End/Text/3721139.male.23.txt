out the young? Anyway, I finished the conversation up, and walked away. I just needed to confess that, and lacking my best friend, this deserted street corner will have to do. Thanks.    Oh, I just added a link to an Atom feed on the sidebar to your right.
My secret to happiness? A little trick I'm not going to reveal, but I'm feeling pretty damn awesome today. I had an awesome weekend; I already blogged about Friday, so I'll just cover Saturday and Sunday before going back to work.  After I recovered from the hangover, I went out and picked up the Modest Mouse's  Good News for People Who Like Bad News . I figured you'd be able to guess from that last post of mine.  I've just been looping  Float On  and  Ocean Breathes Salty  pretty much all weekend. Having nothing planned for Saturday, I picked up Max Payne 2 from the bargain bin, and played it through. Pretty fun game, great graphics, fun plot, but shorter than the original.  I wasn't too keen about spending all afternoon inside playing computer games, but I wanted to rest my shoulder for Sunday's climbing at the Rec.  Resting my shoulder turned out to be the best thing I could have done given the insane workout I did on Sunday.  I showed up around 4pm, met a guy without a partner who wanted to lead climb.  Let's get this straight, I haven't seriously climbed lead since the night last fall when Misty came up to watch me.  Somehow, I managed to glide through the skills test and get my pass - and I didn't even have to pay for it!.  Then I climbed lead on a number of more difficult routes than I'd been top-roping in the past few weeks.   It was really awesome, but the guy had to leave, so I jumped in with a group of girls who really pushed me to climb hard.  I actually did pretty well, and my shoulder isn't hurting so much.  I'm going to really turn up the heat on Wednesday and see what I'm capable of.  The only disappointment was not being able to jump into the lap pool before it closed, oh, and not getting to the Brethern church in the morning.  Yeah, that happens when you play games till 2am.  I could have made it to Peace on time, but I didn't want to incite a riot by my mere presence, so I did laundry instead.  I finished off the weekend with a cold shower, Fazoli's, and Coffee Station.  Am I getting predictable yet? I loving having an active routine with minimal idle time, oh, and making sure my brain is awash in happy-inducing neurotransmitters helps too.  A girl at work went to Maggie Moo's for ice cream this weekend, and recommended it highly.  I think I'll check it out tonight around 7:30.  It's in the Rock Prairie / 6 shopping center if you read this in time and care to join me. Hahaha, ya ya ya, I know, no one reads this b
