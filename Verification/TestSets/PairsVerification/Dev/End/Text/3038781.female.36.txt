continue their existence, there must be in every few generations, perhaps in every country, a person or persons with the courage to embody and to stand out with their presence as an embodiment of some noble aspect. In this instance, together, I think, they embodied the best potential of deepest dedication and love between two people... even to the exclusion of others. Understandably, and by some accounts that I have heard, this exclusion must have caused some great pain to their children and friends. I am not certain, however, that it could have been otherwise... as these embodiments often have seemed so intense as to be at the exclusion of all other considerations and individuals. Perhaps, they have to be to stand out.   I wish though that we as a culture could begin to recognize these instances more formally... in our language... A Reagan-like love, A Hawkings-like intellect, A Tubman-like fortitude. Perhaps something more along the lines of "A Reaganic love", somehow that sounds more fitting to the President's Scotch-English-Irish/American heritage...   I wonder if that's what it is... scotch, english, irish, American... is that part of this feeling. It feels like it's more than losing a president who I was bearly aware of as a thirteen year old...It's as close as I can imagine to what it must have been like to lose a gaelic or scottish clan-leader... even one distantly removed... a feeling as if someone of your blood, your family, your strength has passed. I've often wondered how much of our heritage is written into our cell memories, into our essence. I know that for as long as I can remember before I knew of geography and distance and heritage or even what my particular heritage was... I have had the deepest affinity with all that was and is Irish and Scottish as well- but to a lesser extent. I don't honestly know.  But, I have been surprised by the frequency of my tears and the depth of my heartache these past few days. The world seems diminished... even if it was a proper age and time of passing for him, even though he was out of office, and in a situation where lengthining his endurance could not have been a blessing... his absence is painful... more painful than I had expected. I can not fathom what it must be for the First Lady.
Remember Me?   I barely do. I've been so wrapped up in working on my final project for Marketing Management 551- A marketing audit for my own business... that I have let everything get behind. Particularly my Email. When I checked last night, my care2 email account said that I have 5770 kb of messages. unfortunately my account setting is limited to 3000! I'll spend weeks cutting it down.  But on  the upside ...  at least I know I'm loved. Thanks e-Telemarketers!
Well, that's been a while.. I'll try to get back into the habit of blogging, but things have gotten so busy lately that I could ask "WHY ME?" but I know the answer to that o
