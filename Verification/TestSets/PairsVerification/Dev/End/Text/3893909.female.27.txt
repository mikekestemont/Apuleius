himself.  Got a lot of SONGS to get through tomorrow-so better get to bed early.
This will begin the story of my journey.  I play guitar for THE BOOTLEG BAND.  We are a barn band that was created about 5 years ago when my friends Ethan and Jake thought..... IT WOULD BE SO COOL TO BE IN A BAND.  Well, they were right, it is really cool and along the way we picked up a few more band members.  Now we are the house band for THE SMOKING GUN TAVERN & OASIS.   The three of us have been best friends since we were 7.  In some crazy way we are almost like triplets-we can read each others minds and that is scary.  We have no secrets and no regrets.  Life has dealt us a good hand in that we will always have each other.  I am certain that when we are 92 we will be in the same nursing home and I will be able to count on them to tell me the truth when I ask them "Does this Moo Moo make me look fat?"  I have a lot of great memories at THE SMOKING GUN-all of which include ETHAN & JAKE.  Tonight was no exception.  As we were doing our final song of the night-I LIKE IT-I LOVE IT-I WANT SOME MORE OF IT-a fight broke out between 2 cowboys in the audience.  It was insane-for cowboys anyway.  I have seen some good cowboy fights in my day, but this one was like 2 little boys fighting over a soccer ball at recess.  Anyway, I got hit by a little debris (a flying beer bottle-I had to get 7 stitches-bummer-I hope it don't leave a mark)and ETHAN just lost it.  He through down his guitar and FLEW off the stage-unfortunately this was about the same time that the police arrived so after I got my stitches JAKE and I had to go bail him out of jail.  HOW DOES LIFE GET SO CRAZY ONE MIGHT ASK?  Well, the fact is that the THREE of us are best friends and as I said we have no secrets...or so I thought.  ETHAN and I were instant messaging today.  If there is anything you need to know about ETHAN it is that HE CANNOT KEEP A SECRET TO SAVE HIS SOUL.  ETHAN said that JAKE is falling apart because he has feelings for me.  Now one might think what could be so bad about this-the way I see it the 3 of us are common law married by the laws of Wisconsin anyway.  This does however pose a problem.... I have secretly been in love with ETHAN for the past 2 years and I do not see my heart changing its mind anytime soon.  Either way someone will get hurt, plus the friendship will be damaged.  So for now, we will just bide our time very quietly because the FRIENDSHIP is worth so much more than anything else I have right now. And patiently I am waiting for some sort of DIVINE I
