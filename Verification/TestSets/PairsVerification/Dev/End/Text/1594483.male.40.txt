putting in their two cents when it is either not wanted or not needed. No one can change how I feel about you. I also know that no one is going to change how you feel about me. I am comfortable with our feelings towards each other. Our love for each other is to strong for any outside forces to break. I do not think they could either dent it or even diminish the shine that our love for each other has. You and I are truly a rare couple. You and I have given ourselves to each other completely and freely. Without either conditions or terms. Neither one of us demand anything of the other. We ask each other and we do because of our love and are feelings that we have together. That is all any person has the right to do is ask of each other, not demand. All that the person asked can do is give 100% to their partner. I Love You so Much Eleanor. In my dreams I asked for a woman like you, and I was so fortunate that you actually exist. I know that what I ask of you is not always the easiest. I try so hard to be fair and not ask anything of you that I know you can not do for me. This relationship is a new experience for me my love. I have never had any one that cared for and understands me the way that you do. I want you to know that. The only thing that scares me, is me. I want you to know you are the best thing that has ever happened in my life. You are even better than the birth of my son. I am going to go now my love.
I Love You So Much Eleanor Leivy Seitter

Dear Lei;
I have been writing this blogg for you for almost one full year now. You and I have been talking for just over one year. What a difference a year makes. Last year at this time was a very low point in my life. Then in May of 03, I found you. From that day on, my life seams like it has taken a turn for the better. All I can say is "THANK YOU!" For doing nothing more than being polite and answering me back. Just hat simple thing turned both of our lives around. I like to think that it has been for the better for both of us. I am going now my love.
I Love You Lei
Forever & Always
Love Kevin
Dear Lei;
I hope you are doing ok? Sorry for being so complicated. It is not easy being me and I also know it is not easy being with me. For that I am sorry. However I do love and want to make this work.
I Love You Eleanor
Forever & Always
