was thwarted by my mind. None of my previous blogs were enduring and long-lasting. This is the one, which has lasted for two full fortnights and is yearning to last for long.

Twas yesterday did I ideate and realise that the way of life one leads is all the result of his/her  ‘thoughts’  and the way he/she executes the thoughts. Whatever one does, it’s all because of his thoughts, be it, good or bad.   From now on, I think I have to renovate and refurbish myself. I have to manifest my thoughts and convert them into useful actions and attain fruitful results and live a blissful life….

People do have interests in many acts of life. “Interests” – Ok, one can have. But that interest must not go uncontrolled.  Got to confess. If I get some new games, I get addicted to it. My whole day’s work gets spoiled and marred. But now I could realize my folly and am in to my effort to control addiction on any act I do.  'Interests' sometimes may give a defiled way to ADDICTION. Addiction results in bad consequences, not good results. Addiction, in every way, affects one and can make him bewail for it. A person may love ‘eating’. But once he has turned into a glutton, then his health may spoil.  Reiteration – Have ‘interests’ but not greed. If you have ‘greed’ avoid over-greed.  Addiction can impair one’s plans for work.

Late realisation has become common these days.. Addiction can mar you down. It can have direct influence on one’s health. It can affect one’s character.  A mellow minded can turn bestial, ignoble and sulky. Such an effect it has got. One’s whole itinerary gets spoiled.So, try avoiding addiction or else it can make you a tyrant of your mind and body.

Had they fostered good character, they join the "Good Friends" group and vice versa.  Friends do play a vital role in one's life. They too have a hand in the shaping of our character.  Good Friends will help you in your empowerment and development and you know how bad friends would be. Yes. They’ll be cynical, malevolent and will mar down your plans for life. There is a saying – Unsinkable ship is friendship. But it has to be amended as “Unsinkable ship is a good friendship”   Try to befriend a good friend, but never tease or revile the bad ones . That’s the motto for “Good Friends” group.  Good friends make world, a mansion to live i
