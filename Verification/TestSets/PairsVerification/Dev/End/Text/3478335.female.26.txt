and it was rather inconclusive but most impt thing is we are still an item. *wink*  We spend so much time at work during the weekdays that we don't have time to spend with each other.  I appreciate the fact that my bf makes an effort to call me at night and chat for a while even if its very late.  Thanks, baby!  Muacksss...hugzzzz....:-)
Yesterday was like one of the worse days of my life.  Everything that could have gone wrong went wrong.    I can't possibly believe my luck.  Among other things, I quarreled with my dad and my boyfriend.  Its becoming more frequent these days and sometimes, I feel like I'm at the edge of a breakdown.  I stayed up till dawn thinking what has happened and how I could make things better.  Wondering if the problem lies in me...if I'm taking things too seriously and if the answer to everything is just for me to lighten up.    I don't want to lose my boyfriend.  He's a great guy and I've known him for many years now.  He's been a wonderful friend, a true confidante and he's always been there for me when I needed him most.  However, as a boyfriend, I have different expectations of him.  And sometimes when he doesn't fulfill that expectation, I get disappointed and I will question him and he will get pissed.  He says that the problem lies in me and not him.  I love him and to me, he is "The One".  How do I save this relationship?  The morning after..and I'm feeling like crap...
Wow...can't believe how fast time flies.  The last I penned something down in my blog was in mid June during the Euro Cup and now its alrdy the Olympics....kekekeke :o)  So many tings have happened and it feels like its only with a blink of an eye.  Hmm..let me tink..let me tink...  I got promoted to EOII.  Its only an increase in grade but as long as got more money, who's complaining?  Kekekeke.. ;o)  School has started..in fact, my projects are due soon.  First one will be due on sat after which I have one due almost every other week and exams will be in Oct.  Its only mid semester and I'm alrdy worrying abt my sch fees for next sem.  I better get that credit card fr Citibank or else, I'm dead.  How in the world am I gonna come up with $3K+ by Dec?  *scratch head*  Ohh...this I must tell...Nazlin is prengant.  Her baby is due in late Feb.  Yes, my colleague/friend/classmate is finally a mom-to-be after 4 yrs??  And now all she can gab abt is babies babies babies...I secretly switch off sometimes and pretend that I'm listening.  hehehehe :oP  What else ah....ohh...something sad to share..sob sob..Daniel's dad passed away on National Day of lung cancer.  So sad..and a bit frightening.  To all those smokers, quit while you still can!!  *wink*  I'm sure there's many more things that have happened but I missed out to tell.  Anyway, getting lazy now.  Will update at the next round.  C
