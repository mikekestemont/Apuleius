Hello. It's Katie (or Jessie Adams's little sister-for those of you who have no earthly idea as to who I am). As you can tell, I received an invite to the blog. *searches for something to say...* Well, I don't think my scheldule would interest any of you since none of the other contributors are in my grade. It has to be changed anyway. They put me in percussion band. *sighs* I just hope they can get it right in less than 2 new scheldules (unlike last year.)  -insert dull silence- ...  Wow, such an interesting post. Hopefully I'll have more to say later.

What would you do if you woke up in the middle of the night and had to go to the bathroom.  When you get to the bathroom you smell a foul stench.  You open the door and a hairy fat stranger is sitting on your toilet taking a slam, reading your newspaper, and drinking your coffee.  What do you do?
Well since no one has posted in a while I figured I'd just waste some time.. School is almost here again.. I'm actually looking forward to it.  My schedule looks very easy.. I have a locker next to Kyle.. It's going to be weird without any upper-classmen here.. I'm gonna miss some of the seniors... But hey, they're livin the life now...   Anyway,  Rick, are you back from Florida yet? Wish you would have come to orientation.  Oh well. I'm done wasting time now.  Goodbye.
