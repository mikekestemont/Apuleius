as human beings are ready for them. As such, I truely believe that unless humanity has a moral awakening of a grand portion, we are doomed to destroy ourselves.   15. I believe that capitalism is doomed to fail at some point in the future and that it is slowly eroding the moral fabric of our society. Captalism strives to place a value on everything and therefore eventually everything can be bought and sold for a price. As such, anyone can profit (exploit) anything of value for there own personal gain.
Just of curiosity, is anyone reading this blog? If so, I would appreciate just a short hello in the comment section of this site. Hello!!!! (Echo).. hmm seems pretty empty.
"here we go to the south side, weapons in hand, lets go for a ride!" (Moby, 200?)  I say damn right lets go for a ride. There are days when going for a ride seems like a really good idea. There is something very appealing in having a glock semi-automatic handgun loaded and in your hand ready to blow some rich fuckermother away.

In order to succeed in overcomming the force of the military, one has to engage the minds of military personnel in the struggle.   Hence: "the battle is not won with weapons but ideas"  Alas, life is not as easy as the fantasy... never the less, lets go for a ride. Let the revolution of ideas begin....
Imagine you exist in a place of utter and complete bliss beyond any humanly concieved notions of uptopia. A place that embodies the true essence of heaven; where one exists in a purely transcended state of mind, body, and spirit. A uptopia where every breath, sound, touch, smell, and sight elicits pure physical rapture. Where your every thought is as vast and complex as the universe, yet seemly so simple. Where all of life's questions have been answered and no doubts and fears remain. Where one's spirit is infused with a profound understanding of life and is embolded by a constant embrace of love and j
