maybe it doesn’t make much sense. Maybe too simple, maybe crazy. But it’s so. I like my Joana and I will always like her. No matter what.   Milos 20.6.2004
urlLink    That's how I must look today... such a mood, like doing not much, looking, maybe even thinking, even if Im terrible at that. It's a lack os happiness, of sadness, of words to express my feelings. It must be that I'm too full of it all, of the same places, people, things. I need to change urgently, to move, to act, to do, to be, to live again. Good that it's on its way...&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Thats me! :) when Im in a good mood ;)&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    This is me and my boy last january, in Rio :) What a perfect time we had...&nbsp; urlLink
So, as you must know I have a boyfriend from Slovakia. We met 3 years ago, online through ICQ. During these 3 years we met twice already, once in Slovakia and then in Brazil. The last time we were together was in January/04, I miss him SO much! Next September Im moving to Slovakia for good. We want to start out life together, to have our own house, our work, to build our things. I can't wait for that already! This is my boy's company page: http://www.mad.sk He's a web designer, so he knows all about these internet things. I'm sure he does better than me in this blogging...
I finally graduated! It was such a hard work with my final project, but I finally made it, and now Im feeling much better, lighter, calmer. I´m now going to enjoy my last 2 months and some days in Brazil; I´m going to my parents´ for couple months, and then back to Brasilia to arrange the last things so I can leave. I can´t wait already! But for now, I´ll just enjoy the last days in this beautiful and cool place Brazil is.
urlLink    It's great to be back home; friends, family, heat, known faces and a human feeling that nowhere else I feel. Our night was in Café Cancun, with everyone possible. These are some of my friends, all kinds of girl, for all kinds of taste! &nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    O frio chegou, e eu, como tenho muita sorte, estava em Chapada dos Guimarães. Pra quem não sabe a cidade fica num chapadão, já é fresco sem frente fria, imagine com uma. Ao menos fiquei em casa, vendo a neblina lá fora, tomando chocolate quente, comendo rosquinhas doce. Ah, vida dura...  urlLink
urlLink    Quando eu vi essa foto pensei duas vezes se eu quero mesmo ir pra um lugar onde o céu só varia do cinza escuro pro cinza acinzentado...   urlLink
urlLink    Outro dia eu estava preocupada com uma coisa: como serão os sapatos na Eslováquia? será que vou achar alguma coisa que eu goste, e que não seja europeu demais, que vá tirar de mim a identidade brasileira? pois é, procurei, procurei, e o que achei para os dias frios foi essa bota. Não precisava ser branca, mas até que é legal.   u
