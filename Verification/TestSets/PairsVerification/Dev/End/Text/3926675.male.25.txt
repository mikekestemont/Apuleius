harsh and abusive language  4.	Indulging in gossip out of sheer lust and passion.   The three non-virtues pertaining to functions of the mind are: 1.	Coveting, or desiring to possess, something that belongs to others.  2.	Wanting to harm others.  3.	Doubting the teaching on rebirth, the reality of karma, and the Three Refuges.   Training in Higher Meditation Training in Higher Meditation helps the practitioner fix the mind on a single object and develop "mental  quiescence" or shamata.  The technique consists of withdrawing the mind gradually from sense objects and conceptual notions so that the mind becomes unwavering, steady, and calm.  Such a mind can concentrate on any object of merit with ease.  To accomplish such a state of realization, many prerequisites are necessary.  To be brief, according to Bodhisattva Maitreya, Practitioners must a void the Five Shortcomings and cultivate the Eight Introspective Mental Attitudes.  The Five Shortcomings are: 1.	Laxity resulting from a lethargic attitude toward meditation 2.	Forgetfulness of the meditation object  3.	Distractions of the mind--usually lust  4.	Inability to prevent these distractions  5.	Imaginary interruptions and the use of false countermeasures  The Eight Introspective Mental Attitudes are: 1.	Conviction in the virtue of meditation and the ability to discern shortcomings  2.	The earnest desire to meditate and the ability to do so  3.	Perseverance and a joyful frame of mind  4.	Experience of mental and physical pliancy   5.	Conscientious effort to focus on the object of meditation  6.	Awareness of any inclination toward sluggishness or intense agitation  7.	Immediate readiness to counter distraction the moment it is perceived  8.	Relaxation of countermeasures when the objective is already accomplished   The Nine Stages of Concentration are: 1.	Fixing the mind on the object of concentration  2.	Endeavoring to prolong the concentration  3.	Perceiving immediately any diversion of the mind and bringing it back to the object of concentration  4.	Maintaining a clear conception of even the minutest detail of the object  5.	Strengthening the effort by realizing its virtues  6.	Dispelling any adverse feeling towards meditation  7.	Maintaining equanimity by dispelling disturbances  8.	Taking concentration to its furthest limit  9.	Abiding in meditative equipoise without assistance or the effort of memory or consciousness Training in Higher Wisdom  Training in higher wisdom is concerned with developing two kinds of wisdom: 1.	Wisdom that comprehends the relative nature of things, or empirical knowledge  2.	Wisdom that comprehends the absolute nature of things, or transcendental knowledge I will briefly describe one more type of wisdom here: the wisdom that destroys all moral and mental defilements, and destroys all moral and mental defilements, and destroys defilements caused by the power of discriminative thought--the wisdom that comprehends shunyata.  Shunyata, the nature of emptiness, is the ultimate reality of all objects, material and phenomenal.  Shunyata is neither affected by the powers of the Buddhas, nor dependent on the karmic fruits of sentient beings.  unyata simply exists, and its nature pervades all lements. Accordingly, by their very nature, all dharmas are empty.  To quote from a sutra, "Whether the Buddhas appear in this world or not, shunyata, the ultimate nature of all objects, is absolute and eternal."  Shunyata is the negation of a permanent self and of independent existence.  Prepared by Tenzin Yeshi (
