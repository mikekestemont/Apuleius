everything, i can honestly say my team we didn't deserve much so needless to say im trying out for a different team next year. the only set back is that because i haven't been able to play in so long because of the cast, im gonna be terrible. Also im gonna be in california durring united tryouts which means i have to get special tryouts. that sorta sucks. it sucks to play infront of someone alone cause they see every mistake you make. oh man. that means im gonna have to train SUPER hard for the next couple of weeks. so yeah. i think im done for today, i can't think of anything else to write. people don't read this anyway. love always -alex
hello there, i've always wanted one of these  but always bee too lazy. it won't last long anyway cause usualy the people who have these just complian and for the most part i don't have too much to say thats out of the ordinary. anyway im lazy so i will just not write in it most of the time. well, i get my cast off soon which means i'll FINALY be cleared to play soccer, thats exciting. also im hopefully getting new cleats for the occasion, i bid on some on ebay but im not sure if i won or not, it ends in 2 days. incidently they are kelme master whites, the new versions, not like the one jon erickon has so they better not fall apart on me like hos did. im very excited.  Also U.S beat honuras 4-0 on wednesday, that was cool and they are curently 8th in the world. (if you don't know soccer, 8th in the world is amazing for us, i mean really, i don't consider us a soccer nation and think about how many countrys there are in the world) anyway, im proud of them. Euro 2004 is starting in about a week which is exciting cause its gonna be alot of international matches...GO HOLLAND...im a netherlands fan. im pissed that im gonna miss half the tournament but its a quality reason, being in california so im not going crazy about it or anything, i'll still get to see the final.  Yeah so most of the stuff in here is gonna be about soccer since as hannah wilkibean pointed out just today...im sortof a soccer dork. also, i don't have much drama in my life and im not manic depresive or anything so i don't have much else to talk about. After all of this, you may be wondering how the title of this entry relates to this whole thing, well, it does alot because there is only 4 days until i get my cast off. thats when i can play soccer again so yes, it actualy does relate very much to the rest of this. alright, well, with that explained, im very tired now and im thinking that bed is a good idea so that i don't end up falling asleep on the couch. night night. love always, -
