So last night my brother and a few of our friends from home went out on the town. It was great to finally be able to take him to all my haunts since he just recently turned 21. We started out at this party at the Chinaroom, which was supposedly an exclusive club at one time, but I wasn't really into it. Expensive drinks, bad techno. My brother's friends are all younger and I can remember going to clubs and wondering why I wasn't having a good time. And now I know that it wasn't because I was the youngest kid there. It was the expensive drinks and the bad techno. So to give them some contrast I took them to Siberia, a big dive on 40th and 9th Ave. marked only with a red light outside. The looks on my brother and his friends' faces said, "this is it?" And then they were genuinely shocked when the bouncer laid down the rules: No cursing, no hitting on women. I tried to explain why this wasn't uncommon among the quieter hip dives, but I still don't totally understand. I think they're trying to keep out jocks. It was kind of a thrill going to all of my favorite grungy bars in nice shoes, slacks and tucked-in, buttoned-down shirts... We ended up cabbing it back to Brooklyn and waiting as my friend took the subway back; he was too drunk to drive his car home from Times Square. And we passed out to an episode of Northern Exposure. What a weekend.

Park Slope is great. It's a lot more comfortable for me than Williamsburg and I really want to stay here. So I looked up a friend of mine from a movie I did a few months back and gave him my pitch: I'll cook and clean for you if I can crash in your kitchen and not pay rent. The couch pitch is always awkward, but at least it's straight forward. People form an opinion of you living on their couch pretty quickly. But I figured living in someone's kitchen could be even less intrusive if approached correctly and given compatible people.  First of all, you need people who don't cook a lot, which these dudes don't. You need to convince people that an unused kitchen is wasted space. Then people need some convincing that it's not going to be weird having someone sleeping in the kitchen. That's not really too difficult, once people get an idea of how few my possessions are and that I'll clean the place up first. I borrowed my brother's self-inflating mattress and I can roll that up every morning and that's that... M has run it by his other roommates. He says they've got a nice big kitchen and they're cool with it. I move in t
