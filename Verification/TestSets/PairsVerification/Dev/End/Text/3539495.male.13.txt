samurai and he eventually joins them. The cinematography is excellent, the slow motion in some scenes helps the mood and the landscape is beautifully chosen. The acting is pretty good too (better than average for cruise). The ending though does spoil the tone of the movie. But there were Asian people in it, thats gotta count for something. The last movie I watched was Fahrenheit 911. Its not actually a movie, but it was interesting. Personally, I think Michael Moore is crazy about putting a movie like this out, but its gonna hurt Bush's votes and im done pretending to be a movie critic.  urlLink
Watched a couple movies this week.                   First: The Village. Really really good movie. Its a kind of schycological stuff, plays with your mind a lot. There are a lot of twists in the plot, and the end result is completely different from what the original story began with. The Village isn't scary like Signs, instead there are some shocking moments that might make you jump, but there is a lot of talking. I think that its better than m.night's other movies, but thats just me. A very excellent movie. In fact, you should go out and watch it right now...              Second: The Last Samurai. Another good movie. This takes place in Japan where the Emperor wants to industrialize his country. The agreement is shaken by a rebellion of people in the mountains who have stuck to the old traditions. The man character (played by Cruise) is captured by the samurai and he eventually joins them. The cinematography is excellent, the slow motion in some scenes helps the mood and the landscape is beautifully chosen. The acting is pretty good too (better than average for cruise). The ending though does spoil the tone of the movie. But there were Asian people in it, thats gotta count for something.

Havent written in this for a while. Keep putting it off. Figured out how to put links in the side! Yay, im so happy. Got  Contraband  and  AC/DC Live  from the Gooch. Great CDs. Velvet Revolver shows real rock, and  Live  is better than I expected of a, well, live CD. Went to Chinatown today, there was this festival and traffic was a bitch. But the show was pretty cool, with the dancing dragons and some stands selling pirated and fake stuff. Got my computer too. It's a pretty good one from Dell. hehe now i get this one for myself. Whooo. Hope my dad doesnt install a netnanny thingy on it. I dont wanna get caught again... Modded my entire system. Now everything looks like hitman. Hitman windowblinds, hitman clock, hitman logon, hitman bootscreen, hitman screensaver. Super cool. But its all is black. So it hurts to look after a while.  Thats a
