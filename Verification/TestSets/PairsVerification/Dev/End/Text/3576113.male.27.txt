dream... ever heard of superficial existence or of getting ones' hopes up?  Course then there's things like serendipity, soul mates, and the lottery.  To chose or not to choose... I mean how good are you really?  Fences are pretty comfy I hear.  There will be another train right? Smile.  Trees are awesome, swaying in the wind, and wind like a caress.  A rocker on the front porch, fishing with feet dangling in the water, a cliffside sunset, and a cause worth fighting.  Absolute trust in ones eyes, a hand waiting to leed, and a shoulder in need.

"the biggest fish in the pond, get that way for never being caught"  Yup listening to a Ruben Studdard tune. *shrugs* Ruben who? Exactly.

The Life of David Gale officially rates second last on my list of all time worst movies, still miles ahead of The Skulls as that last movie slot has to always be reserved for something actually seen on the big screen.  About 15 mins in I said to my friend a big Kevin Spacey friend I surmised to my friend (who'd allready seen it) the entire plot.  Now I'm not the person who gloats for being right and hence smart or something, no I like being wrong.  Anyways for it showing it's hand in a predictable fashion this movie blows.  Now check this insanity: in Olympics past, female atheletes have been known to get pregnant leading up to the competition as the increse in hormones is said to help with performance.
