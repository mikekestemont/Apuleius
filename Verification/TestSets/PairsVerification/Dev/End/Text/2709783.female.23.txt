you've had all day is beer and sun) with some lovely companions from St. Mary's that we lured to dinner with us, we crashed a bachelor party at Tavern on the Gruene, down the road. Actually, we were minding our own drunken business and our table was crashed by the bachelors (most of whom were married). But it was all in good fun. We finally drug Darby back to the hotel, where we nursed sunburns and hangovers most of the morning.       The South Texas Bachelorette Weekend of Fun, the finale: Met up with Mom in Luckenbach to hear some good tunes and relax for one more day. Was pleasantly surprised to see several of my favorites were playing, and even more pleasantly surprised to run into some friends from back home. A fitting conclusion to a great "last hurrah" of a weekend.       Finally, yesterday evening I made my way back to Fort Worth to get one last Pappadeaux's fix before heading to the land with no saltwater nearby. The ladies from Hillsboro introduced me to Gator Water, which is (from what I can tell) a Hurricane topped with a margarita topped with a shot of something green. They were delicious. Several of them, each better than the last. After some racy stories and more than one wobbly trip to the restroom, we ventured back towards Waco. Previous plans were to have a semi-slumber party at Cyndi's house, which is much closer to the office than my house. I wondered, en route, if we should stop and get some beer, and Cyndi rattled off what was already at the house. It was like the Cricket's draft list; we didn't need a pit stop at all. After some domestics, a few imports, and a couple of Goldschlager shots, it was--of course--time to play dominoes. Somehow I made it until 2, waiting for someone else to say they were tired so I wouldn't be the first one again. I think it was pretty even this time. I successfully navigated Cyndi's house this morning and made it to work on time, comforted by the fact that my coworkers were as miserable as I was all morning. It also helped that I had leftover salmon for lunch.        I'm so bad at bulleted lists. I'm too long-winded for them. But at least I try.   So that's it. These events, among others, are what has kept me from the blessed blog lately. I'll be cutting off the utilities this weekend and heading to Dudley, which is the greatest place on earth, but also does not have broadband internet. So if I can bear the rotary dial-up (I'm not joking, Mom still has a rotary phone and refuses to get touchtone), I'll be in touch next week.   Also, anyone interested in a *free* two-way trip to Kansas can have their dream come true this weekend. That's right, folks, just a little heavy lifting and you'll have the pleasure of riding in a vehicle with me for over 16 hours. Interested parties can sign up below or register by p
