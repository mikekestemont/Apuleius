think I'm doing anything unethical. All I did was ask for help in exchange for good deeds. If I were selling material things like cookies or magazines to raise funds, fewer people would have probably questioned my ethics. But just because I'm offering something intangible in return, people call it unethical? Would it perhaps been more ethical just to go ask my mom and dad for the cash? Or to ask some corporation to sponsor me in exchange for my endorsement that they are a socially responsibile company?  I think that asking one's community for support is just as valid, if not more meaningful, than approaching any other source. Really, who can blame the girl for chasing after her own personal, idealistic dream, in a somewhat novel, unconventional way? It's a little more Ayn Rand than Rousseau, but so what?  However, I never opted to pledge any money to her. There was always a nagging sense that I could put my P300 -- and my *own* time -- to a more  fulfilling  use; it could be petty and selfish (buying myself a new comic, or a nice meal), or it could be time-consuming, "meaningful", and benificial to the causes that matter to me (say, designing a flyer about socially responsible trade programs, or volunteering for  urlLink Freedom From Debt Coalition , maybe organizing a benifit gig). Either way, I don't need an intermediary to get the end result I desire.  Still, I can't deny that  Buy This Dream  has prompted me to reassess the ways individuals (generally) and Filipinos (specifically) put their money to use. It almost sounds trite to claim that 'meaning' exists in every purchase, every financial transaction, in what you buy, and what you own. But each Peso spent represents an investment in social beliefs and cultural attitudes. It has  value , in both the economic and moral sense.  On top of that, Pia's experience has given us new insights into what one might call a "network community" (to borrow a phrase from  urlLink Manuel Castells ). In fact, she believes Pinoys are  urlLink especially adept  at forming them: The success of this project perfectly showcases some of our greatest strengths as Filipinos-- our sense of community, our trusting nature, our willingness to nurture and participate. Our potential is so great, if only we knew how to harness it. Taken out of context, that might read like platitudes being farted out in a reaction paper about a one-day immersion outreach. But if one understands it, in terms of the  excess of P50,000  it has earned her, we begin to see the formation of a vital way of generating income  and  fostering goodwill.  The challenge now is to make it work for  all  of us, without it degenerating into  urlLink pyramid scams  or glorified panhandling. But you know what they say about paving the road to Hell...  If Pia's experience means anything to you, kindly link to her blog, post about it, tell others about Buy This Dream... anything to let the greater public know about her exceptional p
