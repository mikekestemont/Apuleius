orange    shUt uP my InNerjEsus ------------------------------------  Yeah I watched that. loved it. almost barfed. i danced. i listened to 73 1/2 of Alex's rambeling. and in the end i converted over to being jewish for no aparent reason.  For those who don't know "a clockwork orange" is an old 70's flick about a young boy who is charmingly insane. With his chums he rids the world of guzzeling bums. And rape's women like atela the hun.   But oh it's nothing done if he was not picked up by cops  But he is for what he does and going to the pictures never made him oh so sick.    This is one film thats hard to relate to so it's increrdabliy strange.And rated X. .................. i highly recomended it

And with that i have found the power to get up and turn it off     may the devil be your judge
