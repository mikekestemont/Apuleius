I couldnt go to the movies/ mall with a friend cause i thought i was gonna paint my room. I thought i was gonna paint my room with a friend today, but i couldnt cause it takes more preperation. Then i thought i could sleep over a friends house, but i cant because apperantly, i cant stay home alone at someone elses house for a few hours. Then, i thought i was gonna go to the mall with some friends today, but i couldnt call anyone cause i had to get off the phone. I had to hang up on my friend in the middle of a conversation, and couldnt call her back. I think shes mad at me, but im not sure. IM SO SORRY. My mom felt sorry for me, and so she made my dad and sister take me to lunch but unfortunatelly, she told me once they were already outside waiting- so i had no time to shower, get dressed, or brush my screwed up hair. Im starving, and theres no food in the house.  ya... fun day. FUNFUNFUN I HAD A BLAST I WISH I COULD WAKE UP AND LIVE IT AGAIN... -_-  this sucked.
