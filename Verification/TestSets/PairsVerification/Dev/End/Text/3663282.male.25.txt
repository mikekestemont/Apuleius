they listened, then they commented, for quite a bit. But in the end, they made some decisions, which actually lightened my burden on the migration bit. At Bukit Tinggi, we stayed at  Colmar Tropicale.  To say that the place was perfect, would be an understatement. But don't take my word for it. It's probably because I haven't gone travelling around the world much. So my reference is kind of limited. So to me, it was a remarkable place, in Malaysia, except for  Pulau Mabul , in Sabah, that is.  Anyway, for those who hasn't heard of  Colmar Tropicale,  it's a resort, sort of, with a French Village theme going on. I went there with my boss. We took the official car and driver. Since everyone else drove their own vehicles. Once we were there, we pulled our luggage to the reception area. After getting our keys, we went our separate ways. My room wasn't in the same building as my boss. So I naturally assumed that the building I was heading for has very small rooms. So, there I was, pulling my luggage through the crowd, trying to find the building where my room was. I found the building easily enough. Now to go find my room. It was situated on the third floor. Key in hand, I inserted it into the lock and entered my room.  It was huge! I couldn't believe my eyes. It has a mini kitchen, a breakfast nook, a living room with a huge tv. Then, into another room was my bedroom. There, was a king sized bed, or is it a queen sized bed. I wouldn't know. Anyway, into another room was the bathroom. And even the bathroom was huge. This room isn't for me, I mean, this room can hold more than 4 adults comfortably. But I was grateful for the room. Once there, I unpacked and went down the the French village. It isn't that big. But the things they have there are interesting. They have shops, a small games arcade, some restaurants, and small shops selling caricature drawings, little animal shaped toys, hand-shaped wax and others.  Besides that, the food was good. We had breakfast, morning tea, lunch, afternoon tea, and dinner. And since it was a buffet, I took my time eating almost everything they had to offer. Everything was superb. I felt bloated after each meal. I was amazed I could stand and walk around after everything I stuffed down my throat. Hehehe. But I really felt bloated. And that's one feeling I don't like. On the whole, it was truly a worthwhile meeting. But, believe it or not, Maxis doesn't have any coverage that. At all! I was like, uh'oh. Luckily, I found two public phones, one of which wasn't working.  We went back the following day. The meeting was continued after breakfast. After the meeting, we had lunch, then we headed straight to the office. The following day, I had a training at Amcorp Tower. But that's for another day. For today, I think this is enough. :
