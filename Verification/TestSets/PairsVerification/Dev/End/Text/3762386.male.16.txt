to you against kids who are smarter than you. of course, if the un-popular kid easily crushes your argument and proves you're a dipshit, you can always take the easy way out and slam your steroid pumped fists into him.       3. you're not a rebel, shut up.      - time and time again, im seeing kids putting stickers on stop signs, spray-painting school walls, and mooning innocent people who would rather have their elbows bitten off by radioactive racoons than see your fat, blistered ass.     -  the only time ive ever "stolen" a sign was when i snatched a sign that read "shoplifting is a crime, we prosecute" and i only did that for the hilarious irony.    - who cares that you carved "chris loves cock" on the desk? im sure chris gives a damn. or anyone for that manner.      - also, writing down your racist crap on the desk/bathroom wall only proves how much of an ignorant, pathetic loser you are. it's like a confession.      4. dont use pick up lines      - they rarely work, and any girl who is brain dead enough to buy into "smooth" invitations from movies and t.v. shows that don't make any sense, probably isn't worth using the line on anyways. it's lose-lose situation.      5. watch porn so much.      - the more you watch porn, the more desperate you become. i even made a chart to help you.       times a day/ desperation         1-2 - semi normal.      3-5 - not too good. you fantasize about britney   spears too much. you have trouble talking   to a girl without picturing her naked.      6-10 - get a life. get a hobby. GET SOMETHING.    because it's clear you aren't getting any from    the ladies, or anything else outside your   computer for that matter.      11-24 - if you have even scrolled down this far to    measure your obvious desperation that means   it's time to get the hands off the shaft and    rebuild the social life you abandoned you    useless prick.         over 24 - this means you can watch    people hump each other every hour.   (unless your into weird kinky sex you freak)    leave this country.            - those are the big ones. i'll write an article about things girls should never do in a while.       - by the way, "the bourne supremacy" was pretty good. go see it instead of that atrocity "the notebook"
although this comment has been here for a while, but because im bored, im going to write about anyways.        Anonymous said... In "email roasting", he spends about 3 paragraphs blasting someone's grammar.  - you can tell the clever critic is trying to mock the fact i wrote three paragraphs about the mass homicide of the english language in "email roasting."  - fortunately, with the aid of the DELETE key, i have magically transformed the impossible-to-read, infinite three paragraphs, into a basic one paragraph that any moron can read without slamming their thick head on the keyboard in frustration.    - oh, i guess i wrote more than one paragraph in this article. boy, aren't i the little rascal.  - bite m
