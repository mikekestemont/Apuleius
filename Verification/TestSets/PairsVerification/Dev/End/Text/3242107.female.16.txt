yea so.. lol. i just felt like adding another post . well. my brothers pregnant cat is not so pregnant anymore, so if you want a kitten tell me because theres no way in hell we're keeping them, theres 3 all black, 1 black and white, and 1 grey and white. hm.. what else happened? lol for  some reason, i was looking at my calendar yesterday and looking at all of my friends birthdays and stuff. and then i saw daniel zometa's birthday on it. i was like... man i havent seen that kid in forever. and then i couldnt remember how i got his bday bc we only had math and english together for1st semester and we werent all buddy buddy. but damn he was hot lol. hmm... what else is new?i had the weirdest dream last night. instead of going out with chris, i went to java jazz for a while and saw holdens "band" play lol. and it was pretty weird bc i was sitting on like boxes by the other bands where they were waiting to go on, and then brendan was standing infront of me just staring at me lol. so we talked and then he went somewhere and i saw meg with ashley which was so uncool, bc she was back in spring AT JAVA JAZZ and she didnt even tell me. so that pissed me off, and then i kept watching holdens band play and some guy from his band wasnt playing for some odd reason and he was sitting with me on the boxes telling me about all these things holden does to be funny, and just trying to get me more into him. then afterwards i went to denneys with the band, and thats always fun so that was good. yeah so i dont really remember the rest of the dream.. i think thats where it cut off, but it was kinda weird because like i didnt really talk to holden yesterday so i wasnt thinking about him or anything when i went to bed, and as far as i know hes not in a band, and he hasnt even gone back to java jazz since he got in that one fight forever ago. hmm.. what else is there??? OMG kimberly is so pregnant right? well she gained 4 lbs like a week ago and the doctors going to induce if she doesnt have it this week!! i am so excited lol thats about it for now. haha im looking through my window and sadies rolling around in the grass playing in the sun. its sooo cute l
