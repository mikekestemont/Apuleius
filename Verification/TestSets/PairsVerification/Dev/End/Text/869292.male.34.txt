urlLink Spymac ::  News  : "Despite being released in October 2003 — and overlooking the fact that there are nearly seven months left in the year — PC Magazine has named the Windows version of the iTunes media player and Music Store as its 'Software Newcomer of the Year.' With the only gripe being the so-called proprietary encoding of iTunes tracks, PC Mag has nothing but good things to say about the software, calling it 'impressive, handy and easy to use,' and of course, noting its great looks.
