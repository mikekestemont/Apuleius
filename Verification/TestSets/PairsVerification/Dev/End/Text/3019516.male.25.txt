down to the core of whether you identify with the light or dark side of The Force, so to speak. If it's fun to smash things and you watch shows like "When Buildings Fall Down", it's possible you're on your way to being the next Darth Vader.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - I took a break from City of Heroes yesterday. PPS - In practice, that meant playing for only two hours.
Although I was scheduled for a very busy day on Sunday, I came down with a head cold, so I just attended church services. I skipped a lunch event, a charity walk and a karate seminar. This was also the day that I started playing  urlLink City of Heroes . On Monday I missed the entire Big Brother final eviction because of a bug in Pinnacle PCTV Pro. I have since found out that the file is corrupted and will still play under certain limited circumstances. My Aunt and Uncle came over for dinner, too, which was unexpected, even though I had apparently been notified in advance. I thought about Saturday night and Kym a bit, too, because she demonstrated a knowledge of and concern for my beliefs that had not been mentioned that night. I almost called in sick on Tuesday, then soldiered on after clearing my head of the mucus that had built up overnight. I did stay home from karate, though. At work I started a significant redesign of the bulk data entry web service, because it was not equipped to handle some new demands. My head cold continued on Wednesday (and is, in fact, still going right now). I missed no work during the week.

I took time to design it properly, which pinpointed the trouble spots and let me informally specify them. I'm doing this one by the book, just to see if it really does keep costs and development time down. The youth group program for the night was based on The Apprentice, which worked rather well. On Saturday I filled most of my day with City of Heroes (I can quit any time I want) and also trekked out to the Garden City Megaplex to see Shaolin Soccer. Shaolin Soccer is, by far, the best kung-fu sports comedy ever. I do think that it could have been written a bit better, though.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - Then again, without poor writing, how would we know it's a kung-fu movie? PPS - I mean, apart from the kicking, punching, jumping and s
