independent/undecideds. Plus there are plenty or rural, evangelican Christians, Southerners and anti-intellectuals that are potential Kerry people. Why alienate them and push them into the Bush camp? Can Kerry win the election only carrying Red states? And don't forget that there are Blue staters mixed in with the Reds.

Many thanks to Keith Robinson for his sharing  urlLink thoughts  on the Good Blog:   A successful blog (or blogger) is…  Well written.  Good content will make or break your blog. Period. This it the #1 thing that makes a blog successful in my book.  Frequently updated.  Unless you’re a guru of some sort you really need to stay on top of it. This can be a real challenge.  Consistent.  This is kind of a combination of the first two. I like sites that are able to maintain quality and frequency overtime.  Open.  I like to read people who are honest and willing to talk about tough issues in a free and open way.  Responsive.  Those who respond to feedback and try to adapt to the wants and needs of their audience get high marks from me.  Well designed.  Yes, I do judge a blog by its design. It’s not the most important thing, but I’d be lying if I said it didn’t matter at all.  Aware of its audience.  If you don’t know your audience it’ll show.  Varied in topic.  I feel there are lots of people who would disagree with this, but I like sites that change the subject every once in awhile.  Personal.  I tend to enjoy a blog with a bit of a personality. I want to “get to know”, to a certain degree, the person(s) behind the site. Tone and style have a lot to do with this.  Thick skinned.  With any successful site comes nay-sayers, trolls, pedants and spammers.  Honest.  Readers are smart and they can smell bullshit.  Accountable.  Mistakes are inevitable and there are times when it’s best to fess up and admit where you’re wrong.  Funny.  I like a blog that can make me laugh on occasion.   In the old days, I would have clipped this passage from the newspaper, posted it to my bulletin board and mailed it to a few people with the attribution scrawled across the top. Things change.
and I stood on my chair and cheered. She was one of a dozen scientists, poets, etc., getting honoraries, and the tallest one there. I got a law degree.  urlLink Read this  for a moving eulogy.  And the Times created a  urlLink special section  in her honor.   Out of respect, I placed a copy of  urlLink Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Volume One  on my cookbook stand.  Next weekend, I'll cook from it.
Sleep all day.  Hate it.
Drinking blogs from a firehose.  Trying to figure out some of the technical possibilities.  Favorite links, books, amazon.com wishlist, 100 things about me.  What is p
