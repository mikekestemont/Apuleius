Hi I am stuck in labs and its late... have started having panicky thoughts about thesis... guilty thoughts... I have spent more time shopping than thesis writing  And obviously this Blog spot thing is another thing to do besides dreaded thesis  I don't understand too, because everyone else's blog spot looks better than mine. I don't know how to put on photos or anything.    Keep hearing creepy noises in the lonely labs.  :-(
urlLink    &nbsp; I took the train down from Genova to Roma, and tried to find the hotel which was on the real outskirts of Roma... and met up with Helen there.&nbsp; The 'airconditioning' of the first hotel was a small fan, but we got a much nicer hotel after that near to the main train station.&nbsp; Helen had arrived in 3 inch stilletoes, with (just in case) an extra 4 pairs of stilletoes in her case.&nbsp; The first day was just me and Helen... we went round the historical centre, on a walk in one of helen's guide book with comedy compass.&nbsp; Helen's feet were hurting due to stilletoes after the first 30 minutes, and feet (dirtiness of, painfullness of, infection due&nbsp;to mosquitoe bites of, freaky small toes of) were to be&nbsp;the running theme of the whole weekend. On our first walking tour me and helen funnily enough arranged to go past shops, but we also saw the Pantheon (2 thousand years old Roman building still in use) and by accident walked around the whole perimeter of ancient Roma (despite comdey compass).&nbsp; Then me and Helen went to eat and talked about romance. Met up with Emz late that night... we got beer and drank it.&nbsp; The next day me, Emz and H all went to ancient Roma, we went round the Domus Aureas (a old palace built by emporor nero before the colluseum), which is all underground due to romans building baths on top.&nbsp; Then we all got dressed up to look respecible (which took quite a while for me) and went to the Vatican.&nbsp; Went into St Peters Basilica, and then H and E forced me (despite fear of heights) to walk up to the top of the dome in some of H's evil stilletoes, then they laughed about it.&nbsp; The view was good tho from the top, tho of course I didn't admit it to them. We all got dressed up that night.&nbsp; After a whole day of limping on Helen's part, she put on a pair of 4 inch stilletoes and floated over the cobbles all round roma that evening - amazing, the power of alcohol.  Emma, Helen and me in Italy!!!&nbsp; u
