I just decided to call it a day and drive home.  Well happy ID4 peoples.
Another Day, another parade, this time West Jordan in the morning and Sandy in the evening. At least that is the last of them for a short while. Well I hope. One more parade and I will pelting the candy at the darling little brats instead of throwing them.  Went to Sugarhouse park in the afternoon between parades and caught up with Megan, Jesse and Anne in their little tent, wish I could've stayed instead of going to Sandy, but the Sandy gig was a part of my new paying job (#1). At least I got to met Will who will be working with my on paying job (#2). Seems like a decent bloke. At least I ate.  Well I guess I must be the only one missing Utah's fabulous 3rd of July fireworks celebrations, but after Sandy, my cell phone was dead, I was starting to develope a headache and it started to rain a tad. I just decided to call it a day and drive home.  Well happy ID4 peoples.
I have rediscovered old my old CD's of "The Corrs" last night after having a long conversation with Kass about them. She introduced me to their cover of Jimmy Hendrix's "Little Bird", I dittoed it back by indroducing her to their cover of Fleetwood Mac's "Dreams".  Anyway from that, I have listend to all my old CDs, going all the way back to 1996. It is nice to sometimes to discover old friends and favorites again.  Plus Andrea Corr is still freaking H-O-T after all these years. Actually the entire family is very doable and I would have trouble saying no to any of them if they came a'knocking at my door one day.  Gave the Building Key back to Arlyn today instead of Tuesday. Still have the office key, actually the only reason I gave the building key back today is they are one building key short in the office (Lord knows what happened to either Bryan's or Adam's after they left a few short weeks ago).  I have been on my job all of one day, and I love it! Rang and co-ordinated around today, and it is cool. Tommorrow I got to drive to Taffy Town to pick up 8 boxes of Candy for the Sandy 4th of July parade of all things. But it is so fun! Had great conversations with Trisha and Adrienne today. When I told Laurie about my new job she squealed in delight. I am really lucky to have just great friends.  Went to The Bajou this evening to have dinner with Danny. I orded the Sweet Potato fires. Gosh, I LOVE those sweet potato fries. Thankfully I was not that hungry so that is all I had, well that and the ice tea. It was really odd to go into a bar (even a trendy bar like The Bajou which has a full menu) and not order any alcohol. Well my wallet is happy at any r
