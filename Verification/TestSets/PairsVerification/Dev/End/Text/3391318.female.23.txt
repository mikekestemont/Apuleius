my life today. The story is simple.    One day, an old man, a young boy, and a donkey were traveling down a dirt road. The old man began to weary before they reached the town so without much thought, he climbed up onto the donkey's back while the young boy led the trio into the nearest town. As they entered the town, a bunch of ladies gathered in one corner eyed the threesome then declared, "Oh, look at that! The poor child has to walk while the adult rides on the back of the donkey. For shame!"    Hearing this, the old man and the young boy switch places, the child now riding the donkey with the man leading. Further into town, they fall prey to more whispers.  "What's this? A strapping young lad riding a donkey while an elderly man is forced to walk? This is not right!"  So again, the pair eye each other and change their methods. This time, both the man and the boy began to ride the donkey through the town. Of course, the townspeople then took pity on the donkey. A poor donkey having to carry the burden of two people. Terrible.  To remedy this, both of them climb off of the donkey,each taking part of the reign and then proceed to walk the donkey.  As they leave the town, a final banter of words follow them.  "Look at this. A perfectly good donkey and neither of those two fools are riding it. The donkey has it easy!"   This is life. People will always find something to pick on you for. No matter how you live your life, slacker to workaholic, student to teacher, Hermit Crab to Social Butterfly...They will find a way to try and take you down. I wouldn't exactly say it is a malicious vibe just built in. People covet stupid things on a daily basis. I, personally, never understood the concept of jealousy. Who wants to have a friend who's not interested in having you? What's the point of getting pissy because someone gets to sleep in every morning and you might have to get up early? To be jealous is a grand waste of time and feeding people who are jealous of you or covet your type of lifestyle is also a waste of time. When are people going to wake up and see that they can have whatever they want? Want to sleep in? Change your hours! Change your job! Roll in late! Don't sit and glare because you feel like you "have to". Want to go on vacation? Save your money! Find someone who will split the cost with you! Take out a loan!         Of course the reality of time does play a factor in all of these things but the lesson is rarely about instant self gratification anyway. I, personally, would have trampled all of those people while riding the donkey with the old man and young boy hanging from the saddle bags. Got something to say, say it. Don't make me open up a can of t
