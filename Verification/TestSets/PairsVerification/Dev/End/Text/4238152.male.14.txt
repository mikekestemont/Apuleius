is so  enterprising . Temporary, really!) is torn apart from the wall, which has already began, the wall will have to fall due to an unstable equilibrium and gravitational forces. And being enterprising students, they must make the best of the fallen wall. So they’ll see which side has a disliked teacher/student and have the wall fall towards that direction. So far, there have been no incidents of such nature and I sincerely hope so since I’m sitting next to the wall but as a good student, I would now like to share some of there magical techniques on banging the wall, which will certainly make you, go “wow”.  Beginner’s guide to banging the wall  The good ‘ole way…  Simply ram your elbow  ala  a rugby tackle at the wall and marvel at Newton’s laws and the conservation of energy. Note, this method no matter how macho it makes you feels is ill – advised, as you will feel great discomfort in your elbow the following day.  Knock, knock, who’s there?  This method was developed by the normal stream of 2002 last year during reading sessions in the hall where they repeatedly slammed their reading materials on the floor much to the supervising teacher’s annoyance. This method has proven to be a hit among passive students who only want to make noise without having any fatalities.

This method involves shouting vulgarities at the wall in the belief that sound travels through hard objects faster. Obviously, the nut head hasn’t been doing much reading up ( retained ?) otherwise he would have realized that the wall is make up of chipboard and sponge which doesn’t propagate sound but on the contrary absorbs it. Not to be defeated, there is a plan B. This involves throwing or banging (or a combination of both) either a basketball or chair at the wall. The result would be the students at the other side of the wall retaliate in kind or ask Mr. Ang to witness the event.  A few words of advise before I end this piece and proceed to fine tuning my methods of wall banging, one must realize that at the end of the day, the school is where you receive your education and not where you bang walls. Banging of walls or fellow students should preferably be done outside school.  Nofing has learnt his lesson and has stopped banging the wall. Unfortunately, those nut heads led by Ron on the other side of the wall have not learnt their lesson. He feels that those losers should go bang their heads against a wall or bang someone.
