sound system to find, purchase, and install at church, expanding our contemporary praise and worship song category, beginning to study to preach Revelation once we're done with "The Purpose Driven Life"....that's just church.  At home, I can't do much with one hand (day 59 of shoulder sling) so I work mostly at this desk.  I've got emails to return, some from old friends I haven't seen in years, others from present-day presences.  I need to transform my other blog into a "POF" blog.  Oh, quick lesson---"POF" stands for Professional Offensive Football, the fantasy football game started by my brother and I in 1983.  We played two years, then resurrected it in 1997.  This season, it's the drive to Paper Bowl VIII!!  We have a championship plaque and everything! This way, all team owners can catch up on the latest roster moves, stats, etc, just by stopping by the blog.  Then there's school!  The kids have new backpacks, they're already filled with supplies, and they're ready to start back tomorrow!  Rachel goes to 2nd grade at our brand new elementary school, where, in September, parents/staff will meet to decide whether to form our parent teacher group as a PTA or as a PTO.  What's the difference, you ask?  Sorry, that's a whole 'nother post for another time....  Well, off to check out the blog world, then I must get some rest! Getting one thing done on your to-do list is exhausting!
Time for some Witham facts to help you understand who we (mostly I, since my wife and kids don't blog) are, and you'll hopefully stop by here from time to time.  1) We love God, and His Son Jesus! 2) We absolutely love Mountain Dew (both diet and regular) 3) There are too many TV's in our house, 4) Our house is too small, but the mortgage payment's just right. 5) We drive 45 miles one way to church (it's because it's where I pastor) 6) My 7-year old daughter helps me lead praise songs. 7) Football season is taken very seriously... 8) Fantasy Football season is taken even more seriously... 9) We have a huge HGTV fan here....and it's not me. 10) I prefer Steve on Blue's Clues, my girl prefers both him and Joe. 11) My son awaits May 25, 2005 when the final Star Wars movie arrives. 12) Until such time he plays Rachet and Clank and Yu-Gi-Oh. 13) His parents are sick of Yu-Gi-Oh. 14) Gino's Restaurant in Glen Allen next to Target is da bomb! 15) My wife is a compulsive cleaner. 16) My kids and I make sure she finds plenty to fulfill that desire... 17) Yes, we're Christians, but we didn't buy our kids at Wal-Mart, if ya know what I mean.... 18) I like Genesis....the group and the book in the Bible! 19) We've never met a french fry we didn't like. 20) We can never have enough friends.  We'll (oops, I'll...) be talking about just about everything here; just depends on what life sends our way.  Hope to see you on the r
