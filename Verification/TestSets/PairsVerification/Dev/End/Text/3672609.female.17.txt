Uberlebensgross.  So afterwards we went to East Side Mario's, but they closed early so we went to Kayleigh's house.  Good times.  I had a horrible dream last night.  It was just so depressing.  :(  In happier news, I TALKED TO ASHLEIGH! in case anyone missed that comment.  She's having the time of her life, sends her love and she wants letters from everyone!   Asheligh Clark RAD 5815 State University Dr Room B-215 Long Beach CA    90815 USA So send her mail and she'll mail you back! (she has no email) Anyway, I'm going to check my laundry and start to pack... only 2 more sleeps! So in case I don't talk to everyone before I leave, goodbye and have an excellent week! :) xoxo
Back in Saskatoon for a bit...  My summer has been so incredible! I've had such a great time that now as I'm thinking about it, I could wait a while for school to start. Only about 15 days.....ouch! But there's only 3 more days until Courtney gets back! Yay! That was one of the things that didn't work out this summer. The other thing is a lot different. But she'll be back super soon! It was really weird coming home and just hanging around my house. My new house is very cool, but it still doesn't feel like home. And then there's all of my friends, but I missed out on a lot and all I ever think about is the summer I had out of ToonTown. It all kind of worked itself out though. Wasksiu was so much fun! I don't think I've ever had that much fun with Russian leaders. Hahaha...good times. Not much else to say....Ciao bella! I
Bah... so frustrated right now. I hate being patronized. Like, all old people (parents, grandparents, etc) Think that because you're young, you're stupid. And by stupid I mean, completely ignorant about all world issues, and incapable of  really  knowing how you feel or think.  But , despite all this, they still expect you to have already decided what you want to do with the rest of your life when you're 17 [I don't know how many times this summer I've been asked "So, what are you planning on doing after high school"... argh]. If that's not enough pressure, when and if you do decide, the school's much too expensive, and they "can't understand why you couldn't just go to a school closer to home instead." bah.    Just another happy little rant from your friend in Old People Land... luckily, my uncle's here now, and after that I'm off to the  youth  gathering! yay!    Last post for awhile so, bye for now and don't have too much fun without me!
123456 SWITCH      Well, here I am, in Ontario... is it possible for me to be already sick of family after 2 days?  hm....  well, call my cell if you're ever bored, chances are I'll need the chat.  Meanwhile, I sit by the pool in beautiful Ontario weather with crazy family around me. :P      Crazy Going Slowly Am I    654321 S
