wake-up at 5:30am...cuz i had to catch the 7am ferrie...beeecccaause...yesterday i went to vancouver with lauren(the best ate ev..lol)...and it twas quite fun..
well yesh...it's kinda funny cuz the reason why i went to vancouver is cuz i wanted to spend some time with Richie while lauren attended a camp training...but things changed quite a bit..things got cancelled and i ended up seeing richie for only 3 hours..yyyeah..  i would have been really upset...and i'm not saying that i wasnt disapointed..i'm just saying that i'm not as mad as i prolly would have been cuz i'm so thankful that the Lord let me see him and that He blessed me with the 3 hours that i did get to spend with him.  when i think about it..yeah..i would be a much happier camper if we didnt have to cross a giant puddle to see eachother..but at the same time...having to do that makes me cherish the time that i do get to spend with him...and it makes everything so much more specialer...lol...SPECIALER!
hehehe...but yesh...i did have quite a good time with the mainlanders that me and lauren got to chillax with!!  from goin around with Richie and Dabz to MacDic's, my very first trip to Metro Town to bother Skwirrel as he showed us his skills at selling treadmils and to get Bubble Tea; to goin to john's house for 5 mins then vanessa's for 10 then to Phoa Hong with Benji, Renee, Jenilee, Mike, John, Vanessa and her nephew, Je...oh...and that thing called Jom; to goin to the CFC partay and jamming in JE's van with Jom; driving around with crazy JE to look for gas then ending up at his house..then goin back to the Partay and busting some dance moves with some CFC and some YFCers like Paul, Kaye, Mary Anne, Rizel...; to goin to Jen's and seeing Beamer and shleeping...  i just wanted thank all of you guys cuz Lauren and i had an oh-some time!! thank you jen for taking us to the terminis so damn early!!
hahaha...and today had a yard sale at my house for a fundraiser....it was pretty shnazzy!!
i had a great weekend!! and even tho i didnt really get to do wut i had planned on and i didnt get to spend as much time as i wanted to with my Boon.. i'm thankful for all the good times that the He blessed me with!!

i opened my eyes to a world
filled with such radiant beauty
i felt the wind
cradle me in it's arms
as the sun's golden rays
gently kissed my cheek
my eyes are filled
with the luminous colours that surround me
i close my eyes
and i hear the world singing a song
one that i've never heard before
my breath taken
by the purity of God's creation
my heart smiles
as i am filled with such happiness
knowing that the Lord has made me a part
of an everlasting b
