that night. So, it gave me an opportunity to practice some indie-rock photography techniques without feeling guilty. Now all I have to do is figure out how to get the pictures from my camera to my computer.  I also got good and drunk on Saturday night. That was fun. Although I told Luke that he ruined my blog. Which I think he did. Add to that Seth's spy-guy antics and I'm really feeling sort of hostile to this whole thing. I think it has quickly lost its point. If I ever had a point to begin with. Now I need to decide what I'm going to do with this thing.  Woke up bright and early Sunday morning. Decided to spend the entire day doing research for   The Novel  . That was fun. I didn't wear pants for most of the day. So yeah, productive weekend, which ultimately depresses me because it brings to the forefront how fun my life used to be and how boring it now is. Now I need to decide what I'm going to do with that thing too.
If so, tell me why I should.  Thanks.
I was starting to rest a little easier because I've gone two whole days without an awkward  urlLink  Jackie  -in-my-office conversation. But then I just ran into her in the restroom. She's wearing less makeup today, making her look like your average older woman. And I noticed three new oddities:  1. She has no compunction with trying to hold a conversation with someone while they've got a mouth full of foamy toothpaste;  2. She wanders in and out of bathroom stalls for a good three minutes before her bladder forces her to make a decision already; and  3. She uses an ungodly amount of paper towels when she dries her hands.  But I do have to say this: she is admirably hygienic. She washes her hands both  before  and  after  using the toilet. We should all be so clean.

Back from the Jersey Shore.  It's the new Hamptons, you know. Not really.  I learned two very important things this weekend - I totally suck at putt putt, but I rule skee ball.  I dare you to challenge my skee ball supremacy.  The weather was great, and as a result my skin is mildly sunburned.  But my brain is majorly sunburned.  I totally forgot my ID badge on this first day of  Code Orange .  That meant major headache and embarrassment, what with the calling of every single person in EPA to vouch for my identity.  Now everyone knows I'm an idiot.  I do have to say this, for the first time in my life:  I am so glad that I'm not in school anymore.  My law school is NEXT DOOR to the World Bank and IMF buildings.  So, if the WB and IMF blows up, The George Washington University Law School blows up.  And I'm a safe 7 blocks away.  Wait... that's a safe distance, r
