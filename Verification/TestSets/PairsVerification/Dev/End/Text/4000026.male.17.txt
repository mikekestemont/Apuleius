tired that I slept from 2 to 8pm just now.Geez... and when I woke up, no one was home but little DeeJay and me.Well the usual, I starved. Just hope that mummy or daddy would buy back some food for me. Anyway I'd gotta go sleep in the shower waiting, peace out ya'll.
Hey guys...finally my com's back online through serving the net. Geez there were like so many crappy stuff in my com which was jamming it up. Anyway nothing much has been going on. I've just been slacking at home doing nothing and studying...well hardly of course.Lol. Oh yeah went to play pool with bro the other day and it was so so fun. Its weird everytime we play we end up doing something cool(also known as a tyco trick shot). Well the other day was weird as the orange ball that was like so close towards the far end hole, I had to hit the white ball so hard that upon collision, the orange ball bounced backwards, balanced itself by the edges of the table and came towards the other dar end at top speed! I was like..."what the.." then we burst into laughter.Lol. It was so cool still. Well then today I my day was pretty good, had some stuff to do for Parade tomorrow, and geez after so so long I've gotta get back into my NCC uniform for the very last time.. Hmm... Yipee? Lol. Well I'm off to get something, perhaps its food or whatever I can get then. Peace out ya'll.
Finally I get to use the computer again. My dad was like messing around with the cable wires and all. Well at least now we don't have to move the cable wire around no more.lol. Anyway yesterday was weird. Missed church... went out with Jake and in the end we watched a movie. I-robot was awesome! Its like any normal detective kinda show but man was it really really cool. Ya guys can't miss out on it ya don't know what's ahead of ya. lol. Well today was good. We had three free periods and I ended up during some revision, which was good of course. Then went along with friends to have a chat. Well then came after school... english remedial. Lol our class are united! Well apparently the teacher was gonna go through some comprehension that other classes haven't seem to have done but our class did. So at first like 3/4 of the class just walked out of the hall leaving the teacher in "pissed mode". So the rest of us were reluctant to stay to but we just did. Within the next minute the teacher was like "Ya guys decide to stay or not go." So we immediately stood up and left.Lol it was so cooL!!! Then everyone else was just standing by the stairs and when they saw us they all cheered! It was so so cool. Anyway we all then headed home and now I'm gonna help my mum make some really delicious sugar sweet. Rock on g
