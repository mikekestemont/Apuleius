news, I couldn't believe it. You were the best to us.  I remember when I used to come home from school from Ruben Dario and everyday you asked me if I wanted rice with fried eggs and platanito.  And then the ice cream man would come and you'd seek all your change to buy me my chocolate eclair.Oh how I loved to watch Cristina with you while you made fun at the people from her show. Ay abuelita, how I miss you.  As I saw you lay in that coffin, I repeatedly asked myself if I was dreaming, or if that was really you.  Maybe it's someone else, I asked myself and they mistook that person for you.  You couldn't have gone, you're a guajira, you will last forever. But it was you.  Those were the hands that I was massaging in Baptist hospital when you told me they were numb. And at the same time were those that cracked the eggs that I would see you make for me when you used to take care of me. That was the same smile I had been seeing for so many years. And your blue dress.  YOur favorite blue dress that you wore to Michelle and Jennifer's weddings, and to all the important getogethers.  Ay abuela, I miss you.  I just can't get over it. I can't get it through my head that I won't be able to see you until only god knows when.  But now I know you're ok. God took you in the middle of a prayer.  As you spoke with him, you took your last breathe. I bet you didn't know that you were not going to see us anymore.  I wish I can ask you, how did you know?  How did you know it was your last day?  How were you able to tell that lady that it was your last day on earth?  And why were you afraid? You knew how close of a relationship you have with God.   Abuela, I want you to know that at least I can visit you at your grave.  Until the day I see you, that's the closest I can be to your body. It hurts I can touch you.  That I can no longer massage your hands when you tell me they hurt. It hurts that I can not longer see your smile, that I can no longer hear your praises to Jehova and that you can no longer spend the time with me that you used to when I was small.  Abuela, I'm glad I spent all the time I did with you.  I'm happy to know that I feel special for all the times that you were able to take care of me when I was a little girl.  We are all special to you in a way but I'm glad I will always be one of your great-grandaughters.  I will close my letter to you now as I can not fight the tears from my eyes as I sit here at work. I love you a
