servers, and now if you are new to the site you have to pay just to establish an account to begin with.  Without a huge financer like a Sony, the guy who started it would have been broke in no time without doing something like this, or even relying on people's good will to keep paying him voluntarily.  All the pictures I post on there I resize to 640x480 and compress them to a fair degree as jpegs in order to make them smaller in storage size and faster-loading.  Also if I had posted the original, who knows who would come up and take them and use them for whatever commercial or other purpose they wanted to without permission, credit, or compensation!   urlLink Here's a link to my overall album    urlLink Here's a link to my favorite shots    urlLink Here's a link to the shots from the America 24/7 project
Wow, so much for regular writing!  Life did in fact get in the way of writing this, at least a little.  I got engaged between the time of my first post and this one and the planning involved in a wedding, I will just say, can be inhuman.  Of course I did have time for other things too, so it's only my most convincing and least self-depricating excuse.  What brought me here so many months after the first entry was practically forgotten?  Well, recently there's been a lot on the news (or NPR I should say), about blogging.  I've also gotten a bit obsessed with the show   urlLink This American Life  .  I find this show a bit like the audio version of blogs, but well edited and with musical ecompaniment.  Then again, I don't know all that much about blogging, so I may be totally off-base here.  The show contains narratives, interviews, essays, etc., and is very well done.  It's much more like listening to a good audio book of either non-fiction, or even fiction, although most of what you hear on the show I think is based on reality.  After listening to the show for a while, I really feel the urge to express myself in similar ways, and blogging seems a bit easier than switching careers and becoming a writer/producer for radio.  So, what I am  hoping  is that somehow I both remember and actually have the motivation to write something at least a couple times a week.  A little observation or anecdote, a review, or a commentary.  Anything, really.  At this point my expectations of myself with this are not very high, but maybe I'll prove myself wrong and actually get something going here.  Whether anyone else will ever read it, who knows!
Well, I have finally found a host for my blog.  After doing lots of research, I finally decided to go with  urlLink Blog City .  I just think it's the best thing out there, or at least as far as my current requirements as concerned.  So please go to my new blog on  urlLink Blog City , which should have more current updates and info.  T
