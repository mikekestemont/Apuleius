raging storms here lastnight. Sqwish, sqwish went our feet through the grass! LOL  We walked around & found a nice area where GW was visible, and I went camera happy!! What a motivating and DOWN TO EARTH man he is. You knew you were surrounded by the same type of people, everyone was so considerate, all in agreement over every single topic. It was the coolest and friendliest environment I ever remember being in!! Well I got a  urlLink  TON of pics  ..and there are a few thumbs I'll show you here, too.  When I thought he was nearly finished speaking, we walked over to the barricades near GW's tent setup. I got the attention of one of GW's Medic Staff, and showed him this photo I had printed and asked if there was any way he could get a Secret Service agent so that I could get GW to sign it. He saw the photo, was very very sweet and said he would take care of it and bring someone over. HE DID! He brought this nice Secret Service Press lady, who asked me some questions, we talked a few seconds, I gave her some information, and voila! She took the photo and said "stay right here." And guess what happened?!?!?! Right on, Secret Service Press lady!!!  Ok here are the thumbs, they will tell the story. You can click on them to see the images. The rest of the photos can be seen  urlLink  right here on this velly cool page I just uploaded  . :)   urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     Weeeee!!! Isn't that the coolest? Everyone was WONDERFUL, the Medic, Secret Service agents - everyone around us who saw the photo was so gracious and kind, thanking us for what we're doing, thanking Mark for what he's doing. ::sniffles:: Many pats on the back, many arms around us, many asked for our names to pray for us. It was such an emotionally overwhelming event in so many ways. Absolutely thrilling!!  We were on our way home, saw the motorcade and decided to head to the airport, sure enough, we got to watch Air Force One go down the runway and take off! Right on, President Bush!!!  It has been a very neat day. I am feeling pretty daggone happy right now!   Happy B-day to my sweetie on the 14th, you got one of your presents a 'lil early. ;)*  Hope you all enjoy the pics!!!  xoxoxoxo
