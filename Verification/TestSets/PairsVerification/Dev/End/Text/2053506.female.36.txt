become addicted.&nbsp; I am proud to say that.&nbsp; I love being proficient in something.&nbsp; This world of tea is still new to me, but I enjoy the challenge and the friendship.     &nbsp;

While I was in KC visiting my&nbsp; mom we had a chance to visit a nearby tea room.&nbsp; It's called The Main Street Mill Historic Tea Room in Smithvville, MO.&nbsp; It was also a little gift shop.&nbsp; Here are some photos.     &nbsp;                    &nbsp;    We had a good time.&nbsp; The food was wonderful, and their iced raspberry tea was so smooth and refreshing.&nbsp; The service was mighty slow though.&nbsp; They had one waitress working the whole place - when we were there there were probably 9 other tables.&nbsp; But we would go back in a heartbeat.

My brother and SIL returned from a trip to England recently.&nbsp; They stayed in a few different rooms during their journey.&nbsp; Neither one of them drink much tea, so wherever they went, they would snag some tea bags for me.&nbsp; They said every room they stayed in had tea bags and an electric kettle.&nbsp; I got&nbsp;a nice variety.&nbsp; Some brands I am familiar with, and some I've never heard of.&nbsp; I made a pitcher of iced tea with some of them - very good.&nbsp; Strong, but delish!

I brewed some tea with my electric iced tea maker. I used Revolution's Southern Mint Tea.  Five bags for three and a half quarts.  I think it's almost a little too minty, but the tea flavor isn't overpowering, so I think I probably got the measurements right.  I have five of those tea bags left, so when I'm done with this pitcher, I'm going to try the same thing only using the cold infusion method.  Then I'll be able to tell exactly what the differences are. I am looking forward to my little experiment.

I tried some cold-infused iced tea today.  We've been talking about on the teaswap pages.  I tried it with some lemony gunpowder green.  It said use a handful.  I used three.  It still could've been stronger as far as I was concerned.  I've realized I enjoy strong tea, both iced and hot.  If I do this again, which I could, cause it's super east.  I would probably use another handful.

Since it's summer here - and getting warmer each and every day. It's getting more difficult to even think about hot tea.  I can tolerate it first thing in the morning, or very late at night.  Like after a shower, when the sun is set, and it feels a little cooler outside.  I need to make myself drink more of it.  I know how good it is, I also know how wonderful it makes me feel. I enjoy having a cuppa and smelling the flavors. With all the swap choices, I also love trying to figure out which one I will have next.  I love doing that.  I think I have an idea, then I come across one I want more.  Having choices is part of the fun of the tea swaps.
