And what people have done? They have ruthlessly quantized this experience. How do you fall in love? You "start talking". Then you "hang out". And then after a bit of thought you go out. And when you go out you have a relationship. Where is lovein all this ? Where is faith ? Where is the friendship ?

This city is amazing. It is beyond comparison. There is wealth, there is glamour, there is diversity and there is the subway. If you wakeup from your sleep on your way home, you may find an African American to your left, a Chinese blocking the sight of a Jew sitting across. A Scottish in deep conversation with a Jamaican, a Pakistani catching up on sleep and an Indian, lost in himself, within. They are all New Yorkers! Together but not united! This city has a lot of energy - both negative and positive.  Its nights are brighter than the days. Your mornings start in a crowd on a train whose faces suck all the energy out of you. You feel it is the end of the day even before it has started. Chances are that you are not alone but you are lonely. If there is anything you want on this earth, you will mostly likely find here. You can find musicians on the train and performers on the street. Every street and avenue is famous for its rareness. Broadway for is its performances and 28th for its cuisines, 8th Ave for hookers, Time Square for its timelessness and Wall street for being a wall that is street!  It is neither an empire nor a state but it has the Empire State within.  This city holds the gold of all the nations of the world underneath itself. And besides all this you may be lucky to find some peace of mind also!  It is the eye of the world. Yes it is the big apple!

They say when you follow your heart the whole universe conspires to realize your dreams! And they say you have to watch out for omens on your search for dreams. And you have to enjoy each moment of your search. The heart may tell you that it is feeling sad. But you have to tell you heart not to feel sad. Because you are following your dream. But what if you do not have a dream ? Or may be what if your heart does not desire. This happens where there is indifference, where there is fear of failure! You cannot listen to your heart in these conditions.   Boredom is caused by indifference, indifferece  by inaction, inaction by inertia, inertia by fear and fear by ego.  Ego is present when you see yourself as  one and finte. Because there can be many finite ones. When you see yourself as one and infinite there is no ego there is no boredom and that is what living is all about. Happiness!
