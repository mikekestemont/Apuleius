Today I had the pleasure of teaching a loud mouthed ass a lesson or two in being humble.  I was at the pool hall with my buddies Griffenjam and Macy playing some pool.  The games went alright, a few in our favor a few in the other pool players of the bars favor.  When we were ready to go I got caught up in a conversation with one of the guys we were playing about the rules of pool.  Now I do not mean to sound conceded or egotistical, but I do believe I know a thing or two about pool rules, so I got a little upset when the Loud Mouthed Ass put his two cents in and basically told me I was talking out of my ass.  Long story Short, I know too late, I got upset and made a snide remark back at him, which led him to challenge me to a game of pool.    I must admit at first I was a little nervous, I mean you do not just challenge a random stranger to pool unless your pretty good.  As the game began though I started being more amused by the whole thing and started playing a little more relaxed, which translated into me shooting a damn good game of pool.  Out of three games, the guy started getting quieter and quieter as I beat him into the ground.  The first game was a close one the second game was a little more in my favor, but the third game was all me.  I ran two balls missed, he ran one ball and missed, and then the Loud Mouth Ass got the surprise of his life as I proceeded to run the table, leaving him 6 balls on the table.  I am hoping he learned his lesson, but you never know.  For today though I am happy in my victory, and proud to have taught one more person the being humble is sometimes a good thing.   Always the modest one  LoveLostLibra

Thank you for reading this just had to get it off my chest through my fingers and onto the worl wide web.  LoveLostLibra
I have come to really hate computers as of late, due to many technical problems that are, well technically impossible.  The main reason I have not been posting as of late, even with the many requests from my beloved fans, was the fact that I could not log into my account, due to a password error.  I finally used my less than superior brain to defeat the computer and claim my dashboard back. HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAH  I should not mock the computer though who knows when it w
