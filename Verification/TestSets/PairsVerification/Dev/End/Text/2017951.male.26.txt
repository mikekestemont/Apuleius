 I'm gonna take my camera so should get some awesome shots across the Cantebury Plains of the Southern Alps. I love mountains. They have an almost mystical presence that stems from their ancient age and what they must have witnessed over time if they had eyes overlooking the surrounding land. Mountain ranges are so immense I wonder if other forms of life live deep inside the mountains' heart, or is it just rock?
Reading random blogs has an almost cathartic effect when I realise that what I couldn't articulate is felt and described someone else... it gives you hope and makes you feel part of the collective fucked up world. Hooray.  I'm listening to one of my housemates snore her head off through a closed door. Jeez it's loud for a woman!
Just burnt a CD full of mp3s I've just ripped from a load of CDs from the library. I'm now off to return them to the library... Don't worry, I've owned them all before when I was back in England but some git (most likely an abo) broke into my car in Australia and stole mp3 cd player along with the CDs so I've only recently bought a new one.
Tried to have a shower but there's no bloomin' hot water. Luckily the landlord and his agent were looking around the place at the time so it should be sorted by this afternoon. So I'm just gonna have to go in town smelling slightly.  I put $3 into the jar for the houses shared stuff like bog paper, washing up liquid, etc... after a stinky note was left on the white board by Francis. Why couldn't he just talk to me face to face as we live in the same house? What a wanker!  Last night I talked to a friend back home whom I haven't talked to for ages. He is a friend from my school and church days. We were also in a band together, he was the singer and I was a guitarist. I phoned to congratulate him as he's getting married in October to an Irish girl. The wedding is in Belfast so if I'm back in time I hope to go. My closest friends have already booked their flights and are making a long weekend of it. I'm really happy for him because since school he dreamed of marrying a beautiful Irish girl. God must have rewarded him for committing himself to the church and becoming a methodist minister, he was ordained last week after a two year probationary period.
Woooooooooaaaaaahhh!  I just got in from my last day of work at New Zealand's lowest priced supermarket! I met a couple of funny guys there but most were loser teenagers. I bought a guitar from Justin in the 1st week and now he's buying it back from me! So I am free again to travel. I've got until Sunday 11th July til I have to move out so I'm gonna spend a couple of days skiing at one of fields nearest to Christchurch, probably Mount Cheeseman or H
