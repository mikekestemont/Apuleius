weekend was blissful, spending time with Stephen.  He took off work Friday, so we exercised at the Y, and then went rollerblading at White Rock Lake in the afternoon.  Saturday we watched the fireworks in Addison with his family and Kris; then afterwards, we & Kris sat in her backyard solving all the world’s problems around the chiminea.  Sunday we drove out to east Texas to have a Fourth of July cookout with my sister and brother-in-law.  Spent a huge chunk of the day out there watching the horses & cows and playing with her huge dogs.  I ended up smashing my hand on a rusty gate, and I’ve been wearing a bandage since.  Monday we finally caught  urlLink  Godzilla   at the Angelika—the original Japanese version with subtitles.  Despite seeing the string move Godzilla’s tail and the miniature trains & cars, the film was brilliant in critiquing nuclear weapons as well as indicting those tendencies in man that are more primitive than a creature from the Jurassic period.  Watching Tokyo being destroyed by the monster’s radioactive fire breath was surreal after recently watching   urlLink The Fog of War   that showed actual footage of America’s firebombing campaign in Tokyo (in which a mere 100,000 Japanese were burned alive).  Things like that are hard to bear.  And what were the Japanese who participated in the filming of this movie in 1954 thinking, having survived that holocaust just a few years earlier?  Alas, I can’t answer all questions tonight, so I will now return to bed.  But, ah … more terrible math to make me jolt upright if I do doze off.
Keeping inside from the heat as I prep for my two night courses (5:30 – 9:40pm Monday – Thursday), I wonder just what is going on out there, where (post) post-modern existentialists wear Chanel and drink lattes and I have to set up group email accounts for my 70 students so as not to “lose” them over the next five weeks.  “Give me Chanel (and a double soy latte), or give me death,” he sneered through the windows of his frozen igloo, surrounded by cats and (dust) bunnies.  Perhaps I’ll be able to poke my head out again soon.  If not, then we shall meet again in August….  Until then, keep the  urlLink Maureen Dowd  coming!
I found the above phrase used in an online personal ad today. I think I need to meet this person. How does he know I'd hear music at my gym? Why does he insist I read scary books? It's all a sweet, sweet mystery.  Reminds me of a cookie Stephen brought to me a few weeks ago: Hippo Vanilla Butter Sugar Cookie. There is just nothing wrong with those words strung together like sweet, sweet pearls!  Submitted grades this morning after spending a couple of hours grading exams. This summer semester is finally over. And I accepted two humanities classes for the autumn term in addition to my two government courses.  Tomorrow morning we leave for San Antonio to visit Sonia, whom I haven't seen in four y
