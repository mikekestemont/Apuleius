bosses here are not ready to release him without securing a replacement first. So he feels very much at lost and in limbo now -- not very certain how his career would turn out in the next 6 months (and that's how long he could potentially need to wait). In the mean time, "they" just park him here to take care of some mundane tasks, without important responsibilities (because they afraid that he could be gone or redeployed anytime). I would like to think that there got to be more control that we have over our career. It should not be like this. Our life and career at the hand of our bosses (people who said they care, but really aren't at all!). But the sad thing is, with the current state of economy, there are not many option out there. What can I say, it's an employer's market now. You know what's more frustating? I could be next in line in the same situation, because my posting to the current project is about to expire (or reach the maximum allowed deployment time). And our HR would start to kick a big fuzz to have me redeployed, and our bosses would start to worry about finding out suitable replacement, and... and... the whole stupid things will repeat again. All in the name our keeping fresh idea, able to think out of the box, breakout from comfort zone, etc. etc. etc. but at the end of the day, they really are messing people life.

Sometimes attachments in Lotus Notes is strange. For any reason, the Word icon is attached instead of the actual Word document.

But one of the attachments are icon instead of the documents. Should I tell him? Nah... probably not. He probably won't appreciate it. And he probably thought I was too free to even borther to try to open the attachments, as if reading the email itself is not time consuming enough.
When you think of it, in the corporate world, there's always a bigger dog out there. Once I was working with my pointy-haired manager. He's always licking his boss' *you know what*. But then I really even his boss is also licking someone else's *you know what*, so that's the truth about corporate world. There's always a bigger dog around. So what's the moral of this story?  It's forget about who your boss is trying to please. Just concentrate on your own work, and let your boss do the licking  job :-)  afterall, we the real contributor, the knowledge worker, the professional, are not defined by our bosses. We can stand on our own's feet, based on our own achievement. It's those who don't have any real skill that need to do l
