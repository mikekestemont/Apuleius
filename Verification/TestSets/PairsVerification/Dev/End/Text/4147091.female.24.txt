out of Dublin's book.  When I was living there in 2002-03, there was MAJOR construction on both the Spire (what a waste of Dublins money!) and the new tram system (specifically in St. Stephens Green).  Did construction take place during the normal 9 to 5pm hours?  No usually.  Most of the work took place after work hours, so as to cause as little disruption as possible to the citizens of Dublin.  I"m sure most major citys employ this strategy to deal with difficult construction.  But not St. John's.  Hell, block people out of their homes.  Who cares?  Their only citizens of St. John's....they only pay taxes.  Grrr...  On a much brighter note, Jason Greeley has passed into the Top 7 of Canadian idol.  Good old home town boy from Upper Island Cove (I won't pass judgement on a certain politian from there....even if he is a LIBREAL).  I"ve fallen in love with the young boy (hes 18, gezzz, I"m getting old) from Medicine Hat, AB.  Can't remember his name, but hes a charmer.  And a good singer.  Why do I watch this show, apart from supporting Jason?  I really don't know.  Maybe I like to think that I could do what they are doing, be a better singer...Ha!  Or maybe I just want to see the girl with the glasses get out (cause she ain't special) or once again see Ben Mulroney put on some flashy leather dudes and outdo his father in the public speaking category.  Or maybe I should just get out of the house more?
And I"m off. In 22 days. To Calgary. Leaving home once again. Gezz...I give almost anything to have a permanment residence. AllI really want to do is have a magizine subscription. You know, the one where your required by the law of magazine laws to stay put for something like two years. This is all I ask. Oh, this and to be eternally happy doing something I love. But thats it. For now.  But on to more immediate matters. This weekend is the Folk Festival. I didn't go last year and I feel poorly about having not supported my local music scene. But I will go this year, come hell or high water (which might happen in this port city). And I promise not to embaress my best friend in front of Hawksley Workman (this time), as long as she promises not to embaress me in front of the cute bass player from the Trews. This time. I think its a fair deal.  Does anyone else feel that the upcoming U.S. election is overshadowing the more important matter that we have the devil as PM?  And did anyone see the Oprah where she talks about her time in South Africa (I realize she talks about it more than once). I"m passivly watching this one right now and I"m realizing that I was in Cape Town the same time she was there. Not that it would have mattered had I known at the time...but its a 'humph' moment for me...an 'I didn't know that' m
