got one of the dancers to perform for him , and asked her to remove her top before she danced, (she was wearing some sports bra kinda top underneath). But as soon as she took it off, he went "Alamak no tek tek (boobs), put the top back, put it back!". Sigh the poor gal, I so wanted to comfort her at that moment. While her top was still off.
In the spirit of National Day we now have an online beauty pageant called  urlLink Singapore Face . Basically this is how it seems to work; people send in their pictures, and the public gives them a rating from 1 - 10 based on their pictures.  Gotta give props to the people who sent in their pictures, especially those that aren't that great looking. I mean you have to feel a bit sucky if you get a rating of less than 5 right. Oh Audrey joined as well, think she has a pretty decent shot of winning it.
Went to watch "The Village" with a chick I gotta know recently. I was a little apprehensive cos it was the first time we went out just the two of us. I was afraid that it was gonna end up awkward, so much so that I even asked another mutual friend to join us for the movie but he couldn't make it. Anyway my fears turned out to be unfounded, I ended up having quite a nice time.   The movie? Well it was a tad slow in the beginning but pretty good overall. I got spooked quite a few times and I didn't really guess the surprise twist at the end. That was the main problem with Signs for me, I spent the whole movie trying to figure out what the twist was - and in the end I was left really disappointed cos there really wasn't one. This time I just watched it without trying to figure out the ending and enjoyed the story way better.
Just realised it's been 2 years since  urlLink I first started blogging. . As you might have noticed my writing has definitely changed since that day. Man everything has changed in my life since then. Well ok maybe not everything, I am still single and still having trouble getting laid. Well on a positive note, my penis seems to have grown 1 cm longer over the past 2 years. Happy 2nd anniversary stallion.
A book I found while I was at Borders earlier; it's by the Dalai Lama. If you need advice on dying seems like he's the man to ask. Although I can't really figure out what he would say. Something like "I recommend multiple self-inflicted stabs with a sharp kitchen knife to the gut."? &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink
Yesterday I typed out my first ever poem for a gal. Here is an excerpt.   Roses are red, Violets are blue, Your top today looks great, That's why I wanna sit beside you.  Not a bad effort for a first timer is it? But judging from her response you would think o
