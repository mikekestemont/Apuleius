and a few words "more meaningful" for a client. Sound meaningless? It kind of is, but it's also far trickier than it sounds. Contemplating a list of words and phrases in the English language that have become meaningless--or simply euphemistic--due to over, or inappropriate, use. I'll post it later; but, an example would be: interesting, meaningful, and improvement. Context: Take a look at most products and services offered to consumers and businesses today. Most are being offered as ways to make some aspect of your life more interesting or more meaningful. And, all are intended to be an improvement upon some previous state.   The reality is few actually achieve the status they carry. The most compelling new product in the last 24 months really would be the iPod--I know it's way over-published at the moment, but it's an incredible product from all vantage points. It's the most elegant user-centered product in decades. The services behind it have achieved nothing less than rallying a nation of consumer criminals around a common, legal, evolution in behavior. And, it may very well save a significant piece of one of our primary industries in the US from inevitable obliteration due to a financial model that was--and still is to some degree--chronically out-dated. Is there an iPod solution for the airline, automotive, and insurance industries? I wonder.
Well. Off and running and already having a little trouble. I'll figure this thing out soon.  Ciao for now.
[ Why am I choosing to blog? ]  Blogs are empty vessels filled with empty thoughts, rhetorical observations, and--like our brains--disconnected content leading to meaningful results. My blog should be no different.   I am a creative director working for am internationally recognized design firm in Chicago. I try as much as possible to avoid all media communications--newspaper, television, etc. I have an insatiable need for information though; and so, I have been on a roughly 13-year run of reading pretty much any book I can get my hands on. Topics I'm interested in--but would never profess deep knowledge of--would include: physics and mathematics, the history of scientific discovery, mtyhology and "man's" attempts to describe existance, psychology and the nature of human interaction, social constructs or humanity's attempt to model and control itself (community, commerce, government), sexuality, the development of individual identity, education, the humanities, design as communication, art and design as expression of individual thought, product design, furniture design, architecture--as both elegant structure and/or propoganda, philosophy...and a number of other topics.  The core issue why I am deciding to begin blogging is really to try to capture some of my fleeting thoughts. It's going to be challenging for me to get some of the things out that I want to capture because I am a fairly conversationally oriented person. What I mean is, conversations--and the nature and structure of conversations--tend to draw out of me certain thoughts and responses that I otherwise would not express. I find it tricky to get in that same place when i am just writing. We'll see what happens.   At the very least, this should be i
