discovering the flaws in the Christian Holy Bible titled "The Bible," in the exuberantly humours P&T fashion. If you can find it online, I suggest you watch it, and  urlLink let me know  where I can find it. If you have Showtime or another station that runs P&T's Bullshit, I suggest you do not miss a single episode. Not because I know they are excellent, but because I need you to record them all, and send them to me. Be sure to check out the  urlLink the episode lists  when you're off searching for those episodes.

... You'll get that when you watch it, I swear.
...That I should be expanding the info on this site about the following:
car struts - canada
http://www.arcee.ca/shared/bullshit
i love masturbating
separating glued wood
what are you stupid
The above were the 5 most popular search strings that resulted in hits at my site, in the past month. Well, ok fine. They where the  only  search strings that resulted in hits at my site. Lets explore these one by one:
car struts - canada  Obviously somebody needs (or wants) to buy some struts for their car, and from a Canadian dealer as well. It's too bad for them, that like me they probably live in some remote community, where there best bet would probably be the local auto wreckers. SUX 2 B U! N00B!
http://www.arcee.ca/shared/bullshit  I used to have to entire first season (is there a second season?) of Penn & Tellers Bullshit in  urlLink WMV  format. I took it down do to bandwidth and drive space issues. So, although I do love to spread humour, reason, and logic throughout the world, I'm going to have to do it without giving you Penn & Teller's Bullshit. I'm instead hoarding it on  urlLink VCD 's. Sorry.
i love masturbating  I do so wish I could have helped whoever used this search find what they were looking for. Especially if they were female. *wink* However, I didn't even have the phrase "i love masturbating" on my site when somebody searched for this. I should though, and now I do. And in the future I will make a post about the benifits of masturbation for both males and females, as well as how masturbation is neither evil nor the cause of such things as blindness or hairy palms as some superstitious people would have you believe.
separating glued wood  I believe you're looking for  urlLink Handyman's Corner . Which, as much as I love Red Green, will never be my site.
what are you stupid  I enjoyed making the  urlLink post  which this search most likely returned. I don't know why somebody would search for this anyways, but I highly doubt that my site was what s/he was looking for.
Where does this all come from? I installed on my server this stats tracker called  urlLink Webalizer  which is really cool because it spits out  urlLink stats pages  from the  urlLink apache httpd server  logs generated by hits to my web site.
Aren't you glad I don't listen to my own market research?... or anybodies, for that m
