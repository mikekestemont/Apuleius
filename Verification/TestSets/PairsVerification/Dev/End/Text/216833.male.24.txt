Hillsburo to train at another store. I can't sleep so I get out of bed, waste some time on the computer for a few hours and finally I get an email from the bike guy. He says it would be very convenient for him if I could pick the bike up, but my offer was to low considering he has 15 people currently "watching" the item, myself included. I was bummed but what do you expect. It's really no big deal. Last night, in my bout of insomnia, I researched Denton's transit systems like I was on the verge of curing cancer. More likely curing my insomnia. Denton has a pretty rockin' bus system. There are a lot of routes, fairly frequent and the school even has its own more specific routes around campus. My need for a car is now out the window. I can ride everything for free with a Student ID. I did venture out of the hole of an apartment today. I went for a walk to the grocery store. A few blocks away, not bad. Picked up a few items for my grumbling belly. On my way back I saw, for the first time, a Killdeer luring me away from her nest by acting like she had a wing injury. I had read about this and seen a few photos but this was really neat first hand. Right next to Tom Thumb, there is a square of mowed land that is really just an island of soon-to-be developed real estate already surrounded by a parking lot and access roads. I'm sure some crap-hole JackintheBox will fit perfectly. Well, I had walked across the lot on my way into the store but it wasn't until I crossed again the second time did the adult Killdeer start her act. Making all kinds of noise and flopping around. I knew what was happening so I looked down and I'm standing less that 2 feet from the nest. Killdeer nest out in the open, on the ground, even in gravel parking lots, but their luring tactics and the camo of the eggs help them to be on of the most successful "shore" birds. There were three perfectly spotty eggs in a small gravel nest. The adult just sat on the ground, like it had just been a victim of mis-identification at the hands of a really crappy duck hunter.  Of course, when I started to walk away, instantly! she is cured of her injury. An Academy award should go out to hard working actors like that.  I left them alone, walked home, ate my food and creeped back to the terrible box. For what, I still don't know. But here I am. I finally got tired of the beating sun that comes thru the east facing window in my room. I found an extra shower curtain rod, placed it in the window and put a big heavy sleeping bag over it to block out some of the sun. Now I'm positive the radiation poisoning is coming from my computer s
