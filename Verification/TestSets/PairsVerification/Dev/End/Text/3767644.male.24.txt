still carry hope deep in my heart... somewhere   (C) Copyright Ritesh Nair 2004
At the core we all know, all that is to be known. A smile, A tear, A call, An impulse, A thought, A blink, A state of mind,etc.  ( We) The only life forms with choices and how many. A day begins giving us a choice, to accept it or reject it. Some of us accept it, Most of us don't. You are tugged, over the vast sea of life like a tugged boat. The boat seems small like all major issues that we harbourin our mind, but it pulls us to the dock, to dock at the port ofsorrow. When you are sad, you have a choice; you can forget it and walk away or go ahead and sink deep into the sands of sorrow. --------------------------------------------------------------- This is a Friend I know.   (One of the ones I really care about, no it is not pity nor is it something else.  (It is love.)  for you always need someone to love so that you can understand what unconditional love means. This is something different more like a parent who loves his daughter  (I think)  Peaceful and undemanding she makes me worried sick every time something goes wrong with her. I never ever felt this emotion in me, for though i cared a lot for people always but never so selflessly.)     This is how i analyze she is.

The journey's been long, you have been standing all along, waiting for the shore. You have no warmth left in your sight, your breath bites your nose, you are victimized by the drudgery of sorrow. You want to run away, break free, but your heart longs, longs to be hurt. You hang on hope, hoping that the rising sun maywarm your heart. The sunlight is cold too.You are lost, you want to stop the thought, you fight, you lose, you succumb to your senses of being habituated to being down. You wsh to escape, but you lost yourself to the last change, you are afraid of change. You make a choice, you regret, you drag the feeling, fight it, fight to forget, the memory remains like a thorn embedded deep inside your mind. A thorn that you fantasize, a thorn that you lament over it.  The hurt is your addiction, wanted by every pore of your skin. You pick up your self to shatter again. You accept defeat for the feeling of accepting it gives you pleasure.  I feel for you for I've een there and felt all that, just the same.....  So you ask why I support you. I cant see you like the way I w
