Hello and my name is brendan ward, i live in helena, montana, i'm 16 and 354/365th days. i used to have a website hosted by blogger, but it was quite inappropriate and quite defaming to certain people i.e eminem and ally meyer, so i decided to lay off of that whole thing.  But this website will take ship once more, it'll basically be a daily journal of my life as i see it, with hopefully a lot of good stuff, and hopefully a lot of fun as well.  A little about me:  Favorite food: steak and baked potatoes Favorite movie: Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and The Grateful Dead live at Winterland Arena 1978 Favorite song: Terrapin Station by the Grateful Dead Favorite move: right jab to the throat with a tire iron Favorite sports icon: Heinrik Larsson Favorite Football Match of all time: Celtic 6 Rangers 2- Martin O'Neills first Old Firm match Favorite Book: On the Road- Jack Kerouac Favorite Fashion item: my adidas one-piece jumpsuit or my man camel toe shorts Favorite line from a movie: "and one more thing...it's been emotional" big chris from lock stock and two smoking barrels, a film everyone should see at least 3 times in their life Favorite human being of all time: che guevara, james joyce, and jerry Least Favorite Human being: G W Favorite curse: for fuck's sake or fucking shit Favorite word: brendan Favorite voice: katie f.'s Longest period of time without sleeping: 65 hours with horrendous hallucinations Longest period of time without showering: 5 weeks in 2003, just because i wanted to smell like shit Longest time without eating food: 4 and a half days. just wasn't hungry. then i ate a lot and got hunger pains Most famous claim to fame: met abe from the road rules something odd about yourself: i have a third nipple and i sleep naked, no matter what time of year it is Another interesting thing: my intelligence peaked in the third grade One more interesting thing: i'm the only kid i know to get suspended from elementary school. i told this fatty new girl that hanson sucked.  favorite drink: fierce melon gatorade or lemonade    i just watched You Got Served tonight and have been unable to listen to rap music or watch coreographed dancing on t.v.  this website will express my innermost thoughts, have lyrics i find inspirational and will be a good stress reliever. peace,  b
