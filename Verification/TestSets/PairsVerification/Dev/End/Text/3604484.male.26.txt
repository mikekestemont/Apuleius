twist.  I had considered the possibility…..I had feared the chance…..but somehow I’d always managed to convice myself that it wouldn't happen…..I mean what are the chances….Oh GOD NO!!  You can only imagine the horror when I learnt my niece had discovered....  (Scroll Down)              (Scroll Down)           urlLink      “I love you. You love me. We’re one happy family……”   The third task I’ve undertaken is to start going to the gym regularly. Right now I seem to be on track according to my personal Gym Training Frequency Indicator. Wah! Sounds Cheem doesn’t it?  Sadly, no it’s nothing complicated. The indicator I refer to is actually the soreness and pain my body is racked with. My fat ass must be hitting the gym enough if I can’t actually feel it anymore – my ass I mean. Probably due to the fact that the only thing I CAN feel is the pain in my arms and shoulders.  I shall be most displeased if I do not see results soon. My mum has actually suggested I take up a sport and encouraged me to learn golf. I brushed off the suggestion with snicker and snort and exclaimed something to the effect of “Bah! Golf is for sissies and girls!”  I of course neglected to inform her that the last time I went to the driving range I failed miserably at hitting the balls. There’s nothing like swinging at a stationary object and missing completely to cast doubt upon any hand-ball coordination you might have believed you had. The balls which my club did manage to come into contact with were driven a very unimpressive distance of about 50 centimeters. Birdies? Eagles? Holes in ones? Nope, the only thing yours truly gets, are sore arms and blisters.  Maybe I’ll go back to Tennis. I mean it’s all scientific. The balls are bigger. The head of a racquet is definitely bigger than a club’s……….. and the chicks on the courts might be wearing those Tennis skirts heheheh.  Ok more pic chers! My former housemate Junie recently sent me some pics from my farwell in Melbourne. Here’s a shot of me and my favorite dish at this Chinese restaurant called Ling Nam.  Lobster in XO sauce.  urlLink    Yes it tasted as good as it looks and sounds. Sluuuurp!  urlLink     urlLink    Yes they were very grateful I paid for dinner.  urlLink     urlLink    And on the day of my departure itself……  urlLink    Yes that is me in the centre. Despite my attempt at the rock star look, other kind souls have brought to my attention the fact that I look like Michael Jackson. Namely my dear mother.  Ok, I have the hair! Ok, I have the pale pasty complexion! Ok....... you’re right I look like Michael Jackson. Still it would have been nice if they could have said Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry instead.  Alrighty! Enough blabbering bumbling blogging for now. Time for the Timothean Terror known as Tim to turn in.  Good night cruel world! I’ve already gotten a haircut ok! Lay off!  ~Totally Tim – Totally Trying to Tame his M
