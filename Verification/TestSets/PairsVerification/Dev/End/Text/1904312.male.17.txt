anyway , THEY'RE SLIM . hopefully i'll come back with some good news. i havn't heard good news in a long while. this world is overdue for some. as for my loyal teammate, he left for the west coast (the home of shitty rap music with no flava EAST COAST MOFUCKAS!!) with his pop late last evening. i'm not sure when he's returning but i'm sure he'll fill you in upon his arrival. well i have to head off to job # 2 (# 3 if you count this blog as a job, but i was just using that as a pun or whatever i did) so take it easy until i post again, and peace to all of you who say peace.  1
What up. It appears that all it takes is a one and a half month absence from blogging to be unjustly thrown from what you have helped to create. Fine with me, myself and the man known as Stinga can hold our own, and of course any other refugees from the sinking of Ask Madden may also join us. Just contact me or Stinga and e-mail invites will fly. Anyway as for the history of Wing Night, the few very old fans of myself and Stinga's first rough attempt at a blog may recall this name was the original anti Ask Madden. Of course we were invited to join up shortly after its creation and the original does in fact still exist somewhere out there, but this is certainly an outrage bold enough to recall our old mantle for new use.  We will both of course be needing space to waste time and talk about our pointless existences once school has started again. I assure you the summer vacation whitnessed at Ask Madden will not occur here by myself. I will uphold this blog to the best of my abilities. So I hope that we can build as loyal a fanbase as Ask Madden had while it was in full swing. We will not betray you Loyal Readers. On with the blogging!
my name is M! K! S to the tinga!  my flow is crazy and it aint no thing-a!  now that that nonsense is out of the way, welcome to the resurrected wing night!! blog.  i noticed that adam has booted me off ask madden, and rightly so i suppose seeing as i did not blog for a fortnight or so.  (fortnight definition, anyone?  streva?)  maybe i'll keep this one up to date, we'll have to play it out.  i have a lot of devastating crap i could tell you, but i'm bottling it up for now.  we'll see how shit goes down.  i am posting from ali's room simultaneously with joeflyy because we know how to get shit done.  i'm taking off for new  hemp shire on saturday.  i'll be there for a few weeks.  and, no, i was never in idaho.  miscommunication i sum it up to be.  yeh well i'm out cuz i don't like to type, especially when it has to make sense.    1
