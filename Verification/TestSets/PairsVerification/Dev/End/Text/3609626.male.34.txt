The Phantom Horse Grill it was very good. The best was dinner at Aunt Chilada's (pun intended)! There is a little pathway through a huge lawn from the hotel to the restaurant and then there is a little bridge over a canal with a sign that says "The little Rio Grande". Very cute and good food. We had a wonderful time and Ian had a really great birthday. Oh, yeah, there were fountains all over the grounds, ranging in size from monstrously huge to little, so Hunter was in heaven.
Okay... we all know that Sean loooooves the iPod.  Sean also loves iTunes and the iTunes Music Store.  Well, Apple hit a milestone selling their 100 millionth song this last week.  During the run up to 100 million Apple was giving away a 20GB iPod every 100,000 songs - they gave away 50 of those.  Then the guy who ordered the 100 millionth song got a big prize: 40GB iPod, 17" Powerbook and 10,000 songs on the iTunes Music Store!    I am so jealous.

It is my much needed decompress - especially this year.  I have been wound pretty tight (just like everyone else).
[The following is from an email sent from Chas on August 7th.]    I don't have a master bedroom yet. There was severe water damage when I came up to look at it. They are almost through though. They have finished most of the re-installation. They have to reset my sink, do some touch-up painting and carpet. The builder took a carpet sample Friday so I expect that to be completed soon and I can move into it and get my living room back where it ought to be.        I haven't even set up my [home theater] system yet because I can't get the bamboo stand that houses all of my equipment where it needs to be until the bedroom is finished. I sure wish [Sean] lived close. I could use [his] help in setting everything up right.
