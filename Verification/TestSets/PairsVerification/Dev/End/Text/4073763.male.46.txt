military and its uses I know from where I speak (or write) most of the time. We were fortunate enough nevr to be ordered into live fire but as members of the military there always was that chance. We knew this, we were taught this and we constantly prepared for this. So I take nothing away from our troops all over the world, some facing the possibility of death at any minute. They are the best trained, best equipped fighting force in the world. Devoted, brave and worthy of our national pride and support.  As a nation 9/11 not only woke us all up to our own volnerability, it also presented us with some unique opportunities to exploit intelligence, amass information, react to it and wipe out the "bad guys". Instead we (Bush) invaded Iraq(?). Let me tell you straight up that there are groups of US soldiers ready and willing to do strategic strikes on a sole target up to groups of targets. We are expert at inserting these forces, having them do their jobs and getting them out with minimal lives lost on our side and a clear message sent to those who wold harm us that if they screw with us, we will fight back with all the might necessary to eliminate the threat. I believe we could hane and should used this tactic against Sadam and his group of thugs. This is just one example of what we could have done instead of invading. So what did we (Bush) do? He (we) shipped over 150,000 troops to Iraq. Now we watch as a dozen soldiers and many innocent civilians get blown up week after week. In case you hadn't checked lately there have been about 1000 American lives lost and the number gets larger every day.  As soon as the intelligence was found to be bad -no- worse than bad, we should have started pulling out of there.  The scripted often clueless President Bush, who couldn't extemporaneously speak himself out of a paper sack, keeps spewing the same crap over and over again. He must lose in November. Kerry will waste him in the debates. Hopefully he will send him back to Crawford Texas for good in November.  Rant over.
There's a club out in the boonies (lago Vista) right on Lake Travis that I play regularly with 3 different bands. It's called Cabo Loco.   urlLink See it here   Last night was with the rock cover band "The Instagators". The place was rockin pretty hard. We were winding down and about to end the night when a transplanted wedding reception came pouring in. We were extended another set with extra money (the prime motivator) and kept the place hopping for another hour. They love us there. I must say that our agent loves us too. This place has all the perks other clubs shoud have...free meal, cheap drinks and friendly staff.  It really was a terrific night.  My new ear plugs work really well in cutting the fatigue factor. At age 46 I am finally protecting my h
