You can use "Application.CurrentCulture" to set  these settings.    To keep it simple you can do it like :   Application.CurrentCulture = System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CreateSpecificCulture(new  System.Configuration.AppSettingsReader().GetValue("ur-PK",typeof(string)).ToString() );     Or if you want to parameterize it then you may use the following:   In the following snippet I have defined my culture settings in a config file. The tag goes like this :   add key="ApplicationCulture" value="ur-PK"   private void setCurrentCultureInfo(){  /// set ur culture information here. Application.CurrentCulture = System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CreateSpecificCulture(new  System.Configuration.AppSettingsReader().GetValue("ApplicationCulture",typeof(string)).ToString() );  Application.CurrentCulture.DateTimeFormat = System.Globalization.DateTimeFormatInfo.CurrentInfo;  }

I had to speak on 3 different occassions and on 3 different topics last weekend. Firstly, on Firday evening I had to present  urlLink "ADO.Net Best Practices"  at  urlLink Mohammad Ali Jinnah University . And then on Saturday afternoon there was an event on " urlLink .Net Framework " at  urlLink Sir Syed University Of Engineering and Technology . Event at SSUET was followed by a regular class at  urlLink Karachi University . For now i will talk about SSUET event. Event at Sir Syed University went good. I was told that some 200 people attended it. I think they all had a good time and so did I. Although the event started a bit late (well quite a bit, some 50 mins to be exact 8-/ ), but it ended well. Usually  SSUET audience is "JAVA PRO" but preaching .Net to them was somewhat fun. Specially the Q&A session was good, it was kind of fun to answer their questions. Presentation will be made available online soon at  urlLink INETA/MEA web site .
