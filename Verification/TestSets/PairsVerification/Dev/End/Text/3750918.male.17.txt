nigga" didn't really seem to bother them that much.  The politics that get played, and the double standards disgust me.  Here's a link to the comic:  urlLink RIDICULOUS
You've all got to read this article.  The left are such hypocrites, I would love to chat but I think I need to go vomit because they disgust me.       urlLink READ THIS ARTICLE     Isn't Kerry's wife lovely?
I sent about 30 invites to this blog. If most of you join, it could quite easily be the blog with the largest membership on the internet. I don't know if that's a good thing or not, I've never done something that ambitious, blog-wise.  Just as a primer for those new to blogging: Blog entries are for substance, for adding news items or proposals for protests and such, not for things like "kewl site, d00d" or "send me Half-Life CDKEY plz". Feel free to send me an e-mail if you want me to add a link or change the background or the font size or whatever.  I'll act as the administrator for the blog and kind of monitor posts and keep it real, etc. I hope to see and read some good things. That said, I'll leave you with a photo that I got a kick out of:      John Kerry at the shooting range
Just a note to say that the blog is still active, though barely. I'd rather not do it alone. Maybe it'll gain some traction in time, or someone will come up with something better. In any case, there was some kind of rally yesterday on the Capitol steps about how voting machines are unreliable. Kind of a mini-protest. Some of the signage was pretty funny. One sign said something like "Believe the Chad" or "in Chad We Trust". They must have been counter-protesters.  The argument is that our current machines are unreliable and electronic machines, at a cost of around 28 million dollars, would take care of the problem. Wrong. It would be an insane waste of tax dollars. First of all, electronics and Senior Citizens don't mix well, as evidenced by a DVD I recently bought, a 4-pak of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton movies. The DVDs, obviously targeted to their original audience of now-old people, came with verbal instructions on how to use your DVD remote control, and how, at any time, you could return to the main menu if you wanted just by pressing the "title" button. My DVD remote doesn't have a "title" button. If I'm old, I just hit the wall as far as watching "Steamboat Bill, Jr." is concerned.  Am I concerned that old people won't be able to vote? Not really. I'm just illustrating that upgrading voting machines isn't going to help people vote. If a person can't master the skill of tracing the arrow to the hole and pushing the pin firmly in said hole, will the electronic voting machines help? No amount of money can help some people.
