coming....maybe we could send something to her to make her day???  We prayed as a family last night. It was very sweet cos GG was still awake. Whenever one of us prays, he would look at us and babble. It was as if he could understand what we were saying! I thanked God for blessing us with such a son. Dar commented that GG's actually a very very "guai" boy who hardly cries in the day. Looking back, my dear son has indeed grown - in size and in character.  He's always laughing and playing by himself and it's true of what Dar says. GG hardly cries in the day. It's only the nights that he gets cranky. Guess 'cos i play too much with him already.  U know how at the end of each lesson in the book, there's a question to consider? Well...in the question that asked "what are the greatest matters God has entrusted to me?" My answer is Gerald, my husband, my work, my family, my ministry...........i MUST be accountable to God  Sunday 1 Aug  Today, we had a special treat. A family who has been serving in Turkey for the last 8 years returned for a holiday and shared their testimony. Did u know that in Turkey, there r 70 million ppl but only 2000 believers? And the govt is cracking down on churches? But amazingly, there have been stories of how God has been revealing himself thru dreams and visions to Turkish ppl. The man shared of how God spoke to 2 friends on separate occasions. But 'cos they didn't want to be jailed, they didn't say anything. Until one day, one of them let slip that he had a dream and the other was amazed  and also started sharing! They then went to a trusted Muslim teacher to ask and was shocked when the teacher also said that God had spoken to him!!! Wah........  Art and Taisy came to us and asked when we were leaving. They looked very disappointed to know that it'll be soon...Art sees himself as GG's grandfather. I like this Fillippino couple who has opened their homes and hearts to us.  We rented 2 DVDs - Missing and another one with Nicole Kidman and Anthony Hopkins (can't remr the title). Had a very nice quiet afternoon with Dar, eating fried chicken (there goes my diet) and watching the movie.  Another 3 more weekends b4 we fly to Washington . To make the wait of the 3 wkends seem shorter, Dar proposes that we drive to Tucson next week and then to Phoenix the following week. I'm excited!  Dar's birthday is coming. Chia lat......what to get for him? It's very very difficult to buy things for him (for that matter, it's difficult to buy things for man!!!). He doesn't like shirts, watches, cologne etc......doesn't even want to go out for dinner. Maybe i'll cook something special....i don't know. He let slip that he wants to get something for himself b4 going home, but refuses to tell me what it is. A
