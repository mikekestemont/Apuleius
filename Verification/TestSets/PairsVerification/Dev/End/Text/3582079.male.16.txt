regardless of their behavior, or their manners.     &nbsp;   That's what she said, right before she packed up and left.     &nbsp;   For the life of me, I cannot remember what brought me to this place. In fact, I can't remember anything before I got here.     &nbsp;   There's a man at the bar that thinks this place does things to people. Who would believe someone who seems to have no life besides heckling the work force here. Not me, that's for sure.     &nbsp;   I've got a good head on my shoulders. I bet my inability to remember things is due to using too many cleaning products in an unventilated room. It'll come back soon.     &nbsp;   He sure babbles alot. Talks even more when he's really drunk. No one knows where he came from, or where he's been.     &nbsp;   Some say he came with the place. They love trying to trick the naive and the gullible. I just smile and keep working.     &nbsp;   I'm no ones friend here. I got a job to do. As long as I get by, I'll be fine.     &nbsp;   Yeah, I'll be...fine...

RULES FOR READERS ( LOL J/K)  Ok, hopefully this should prevent&nbsp;long periods of time without new writing.   Whatever story was going on before this message is now terminated. I should have a new one up soon.  Hopefully no one is too miffed. ^_^()

I gathered an army of green, striped rabbits, with two butts, and called it "The Army of Green Striped Rabbits With Two Butts".  With my army at my side, we went over to the cow that crapped on me.... and CHARGED!!!
but then as i was walking home an army of midgets wielding T-shirt cannons poped in out of nowwhere.  Their leader ordered them to hold their march.  He spoke to me in a deep and dark tone for a midget.  "DEAR GOD what is that smell son, smells like you spent 24 hours in a horses ass or something!!"  he was close actaully it was more like 5 minutes and a cows ass i explained that to him.
