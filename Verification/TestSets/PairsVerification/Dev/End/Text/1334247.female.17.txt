are going on. Exciting. I guess the Ft. Madison fireworks are supposed to be the best ever, so that's exciting. Sunday I go to Dad's for 4 weeks. I really need to pack.
Pretty good weekend so far. I haven't been too busy. Just work, and been at dad's. Tonight Matt went to Cedar Rapids to see some friends. Even though I probably should know what he's doing up there, I really don't want to know. I wanted to find something to do with friends tonight, but most of them are out of town at a volleyball thing or with their families. So, I stayed home on this Saturday night with my dad and we ordered a pizza. It was nice. I start school now in 11 days. I can't believe it. It'll be nice to see Fish D. :) That's about it. I got my haircut the other day. I got bangs. They're cute. They took awhile to get used to, but I do like them alot. I can do the punkish straight, ragged look or the cute, girly, side swept, whispy bangs. Man, I'm cool.
Hi. This is Kelly. I'm just tryin this thing out since it's my first time and all. I'm happy Nichole's back.  HINT TO ALL WHO KNOW ME: My birthday is in 9 days. *wink wink* I'm a size 3-5 in jeans and a medium in shirts. :)
17 days until school starts. OMG! That's really not that far away. Anyway, I'm back to mom's now. Even though the 4 weeks with dad flew by, I'm still excited to be back. It's nice to see everyone. But, Tuesday we're going to Waterloo to the waterpark. So, I'm super excited because I love waterparks. Woo hoo. And, then next week we're going to Des Moines to Micki's and then we're going to Adventureland. So, I'm excited for that too because of the roller coasters. Woo hoo again. And, last week (the last week of dad's 4 weeks) we went camping at Lake Rathbun. It was very, very relaxing. I only caught 3 fish (2 within 5 minutes). But, it was still enjoyable. I also got to see Micki Friday night. We saw 2 movies (Bourne Supremacy and The Village) I jumped twice in The Village-one time was really stupid...I knew it was coming. But, I guess that's how it goes. Saturday we went to the Valley West Mall in Des Moines, and this thing called Iowa Idol was going on (An American Idol for the state of Iowa) and I only heard a couple of people sing--the first one reached a really high note and Micki and I looked at each other with the same "Wow, but we weren't expecting it" expression. Then, the second girl started singing "At Last" and she was pretty good. But, unfortunately, I left my purse in my dad's van (at Lake Rathbun) so I had no money, and three birthdays are coming up in this month and I had no money to get them anything. Oh well. They can just get poop. :
