of a story written by a Ukranian (a nationality that constitutes part of my demeanor) named Nikolay Gogol.  So that's my disclaimer - I can't credit for the title, only everything underneath it.  The hope is that I'll be posting more - mostly with new writings, but sometimes with life updates.  Most everything is the same monotony that has been present for a while, so as changes come I'll be sure to get them out in the open.  Things of note:  I may have my first official writing job.  I was recently acquainted with a college student who was looking to start a new magazine, and I'm getting in on the ground floor.  It's called Rabble Rouser and the focus is going to be on independant music, so I'll probably be spending lots of time at Milestones.  Assuming it takes off there's going to be an online version and a quarterly print, which, with popularity, could become monthly.  So buy it.  More details to come.
