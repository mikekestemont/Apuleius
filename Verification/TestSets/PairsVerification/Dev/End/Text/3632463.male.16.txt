Well, I gotta write my Crys a letter. Bye for now.  Mood: Energetic Currently Playing: Chronic Future - Time and Time Again   ..:..:Matt:..:..
Tonight we're going to Crystal's aunt and uncle's house to spend the night, then we're going to be gone all day tomorrow. I'm actually really excited, but Crys is nervous. I can see why too. Oh well, I'm sure tomorrow will go fine. Didn't go to work today. Scott and I are looking into BJ's for work... but not in a perverted way. It's a wholesale club, and it sells stuff in bulk for cheaper. It's a really cool place, and I really wouldn't have a problem working there. It'd be great, especially working with Scott. He and I have been talking a lot more lately, which has been good. Well, that's about it. Crys looks lonely, so I'm going to go keep her company. Bye for now.

I personally had a lot of fun. Crys said that she didn't, but I know that she was just as glad as I was to get out of the house. She made my day great yet again, I haven't been really bitchy and grumpy for more than ten minutes in a while now, which is definitely a good thing. Finally went back to work Monday. That was good. Friday Scott and I are going to look into BJ's... even more importantly, Friday is Crys' birthday!!! She said she didn't want anything, but when I mentioned a few possibilities, that seemed to change. I might just buy her more than one gift. I also gotta get something for G man, although I think I know what I'm getting him too. Anyway, back to the Great Escape. It was awesome. It was mine and Crys' first time there together, and there are a lot of memories. She walked off with a sunburn today. We had some of the best chicken I've ever had, and I got to hit the Raging River a bunch of times. I also found out that nothing is free there, and that half of their payroll is fresh off of a boat from Holland. G man hit the Boomerang, and he said it was awesome, so I might just have to try it out next time... pffft! HAHAHA maybe not. If you've been reading Crys' blog, you know that she lives with me now. If not, then you know now. It makes me extremely happy. In fact, she's sleeping right now. I'm staring at her all stalker-like... she's adorable when she sleeps, all drooling and snoring... just kidding. Right now she's not making a sound. Gotta go up to Crys' aunt's house Saturday so we can go to a party the next day. Her mom is going to be there, and I might just need to see the person who created the person that makes me happy. Anyway, I gotta go for now. Bya.  Mood: Tired, yet slightly overjoyed. Currently Playing: Rage Against the Machine - Born of a Broken M
