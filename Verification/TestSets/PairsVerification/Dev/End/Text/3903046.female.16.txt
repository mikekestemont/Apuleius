Tearless grief bleeds inwardly. ~Christian Nevell Bovee  This is true. People don't be afraid to cry..or show emotions because it just hurts you more and then when you grow up you will become emotionally unstable which means you will probably turn into a serial killer of sometime and run around stabbing people who resemble the person/thing that gave you the grief and we can't have that happening now...can we???
I wrote this while I was dating this guy Cassidy. He was my first time and I really did love him. But now he's gone. Here it is.  When you move When you breathe When you slowly Slip into me  We travel into another world Our hearts beating fast We then become as one As we let time pass  Yeah I wrote that after a night on the lake August 15th 2003

Wow I just ate half a bag of Old Fashioned Restaurant Style Tortilla Chips. Let me tell you about these here Tortilla Chips.

I would hope so! The Tortilla chips contain Stoneground corn flour, Soybean Oil, Salt, Trace of Lime. What is Trace of lime? Does it mean there are traces of lime in it or is it a brand name of something?? because if it is a brand name they should tell you what is in this so-called "Trave of Lime"....oh yeah and Mi Rancho is on 425 Hester Street, San Leandro CA 94577. That sounds like it is really far way from where I live. I live in California...they Bay Area...with the Governator as our ruler!! Dun dun duuuunnn...kk..it is now 12:18 so I am goign to bed because I have school tomorrow...GAY!!  Toodlez
Wow!

Yay for the easily amused!! High Five (long distance AT&T style!!) That is a really old joke between me and Sam Agens (Audra Smith's {me old bestfriend in year nine)ex-boyfriend who was 19 and she was 15!! big difference)...ok yeah I don't know what to write so I am going to go fill in my profiley and s
