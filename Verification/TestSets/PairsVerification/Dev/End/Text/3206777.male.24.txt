far too illustrative of the method by which they are to be solved. These two with their utilitarianism and simplicity show that although frustrating they are the finest cryptic clues.  (the answers will be in the comments page later, clue, they are essentially the same mechanism)   This message is a reconstructed version of a previous D.O.A blog I wrote last night.
The previous blogs have been eaten by www.blogger.com. Oh well, I guess some things were never going to happen. Goodnight.  (this is posted in via e-mail, a good function)  Find local movie times and trailers on Yahoo! Movies. http://au.movies.yahoo.com
The Return of the Fierce Creatures   Another assorted dream brought back the big cats to my subconscious.  I have had several dreams lately about being in my teaching course. The classes are nothing like mine but we are learning teaching. None of the people in the class are from my teaching class either (or perhaps one or two that I can only vaguely remember). Anyway, last night I had to collaborate on a lesson to show our class with an Indian classmate. We did it on   tea  , a good topic. We were preparing the lesson when the guy suddenly put two  eggs  in the cup we were using and I just said "Oh, that is not the kind of   tea   I make." Anyway, while he got the tea ready, I found some wonderful ornamental vessels from which to drink the   tea   from, really nice ones although the shape was a little odd. My memory gets a bit fuzzy, and I think my classmate had rather illicit relations with a teacher in the interlude before we presented...  Then suddenly I was in a wall-less zoo, where the   lions   and the antelope are in one big field with me. Apart from being mildly apprehensive about the proximity of such carnivores nothing happened.   Fanciful things dreams are.
Another new column   Haha, well I have found a category for myself. The Listener has a new column too called "Words Worth" which introduces readers to "new" words. Some of them seem a joke but maybe people use them somewhere..  Anyway, one of the words today was "Generation C", which means:    "Obsessive content generators. Often to be found snapping photos - of themselves - on their mobile phones for instant distribution to friends and family. Or constantly updating personal blogs with boring personal trivia."    Yeah that's me. But he/she makes it seem so narcissistic... Hmmmm maybe I am.....
Today's Thought   Today's Thought is a little column in the New Zealand Herald daily. It is usually a little Biblical excerpt but with the facelift of the Herald there was an interesting change. The Weekend Herald now carries one Bible excerpt and one from a different religion. This is the one from last weekend:   Blessed is the man who fears the Lord, who   delights greately in his commandments.    - Psalm 112:1    I have been insulted! I have been hurt! I    have been beaten! I have been robbed!   Anger ceases in those who do not harbour   this sort of thought.   (Buddhism, Dhammapada)   I
