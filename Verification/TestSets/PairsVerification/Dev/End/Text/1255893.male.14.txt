come later. The movie was really good, but if you hadn't seen the 1st one it would have been better. I expected too much, and when I got what I wanted, I didn't realize it. Just like what happened w/ The Matrix. I guess the trick to getting some of these sequals right is to not compare them to their predecessor.   Woah, I'm sleepy. Must go.
What a day. Let's see. I got up at around 11. Started playin games, at breakfast, and chilled for a few hours. But THEN, Jose and Roy decide to invite themselves over =P. So Momma makes me buy chicken for everyone so we can have enough food... since these two have bottomless pits for stomachs (hope I spelled that right.) So we ate and snacked and played the games we rented for hours and hours.... damn. It really does get exhausting after a while. Well, everything's kewl now. Ave's comin home tomorrow, I get to go over to Johnny's house tomorrow as well. Blub, Ima go.
Went for a walk today. It was fun... even though I was kinda on a timeline. I had to get from Chase st. to the LA Times delivery place in 30 minutes. Made it in 20... but it woulda been more fun to jus go by strolling instead of having to whizz past some old ladies.      I jus found the worst pun in my About section thingy... I feel so bad. But it's a good song, so I guess I can let it slip. I sure would love a car though. One that I could drive legally. One day I'll have my hott lil sex car... CD player on full blast as I fly down Ventura w/ no traffic @ night. Wishful thinking I guess, but I can dream.      I wanna go to the mall and just sit on one of those couches... observing people. I just can't think of very many other places where so many different people come together peacefully (most of the time.) I'd love  to drag Aaron along and have him and I do a duet for chump change next to JCPenny.  I'm sure gonna miss you, man. I hate to make it sound like some evil, permenant... thing, 'cause it's not. I'll jus stop here so I don't go into a whole "bye for now" speech.         I'm thinkin of changin my temp. I wanna go back to my old one. I liked that one, 'cept this time I wont add so much crap. Like that stupid guest book. I had like......  4  people sign it. Eh, Im off. Getting sleepy.
New month, new archive. Yayy!       School tomorrow. Only about 2 weeks left.. thankfully. I'm sick of Ms. Bazan. What a prick. I can't think of anyone else who goes talking about non-spanish speaking kids behind their backs. She even did it to me! Hellooooo! Ugh. Am I THAT pale? Wutev, I'm still passing. I think I can hold out for 2 more weeks.       Hmm, wish i had more to say. No wonder I havnt been getting c
