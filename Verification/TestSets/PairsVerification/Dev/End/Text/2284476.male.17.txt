This one care of Sister Hazel. This song nails the way my (lack of a) love life is.    If it's to be That there's just no one for me I'll try not to cry much So no one will see But if it's to be That there is anyone for me Our hearts will shine So everyone will see I've got some time, So maybe if you're free I could use a friend Just to talk to me   Spent most of my life without Anyone near Never cared what happened I never saw clear But I'm getting older now And I'm, thinking of my end And to leave without love Or without a friend  I've got some time So maybe if you are free I could use a friend  Before I die   It's not over yet... I'm still standing   If it's to be  That there's just no one for me I will try not to cry much So no one else will see I've got some time So maybe if you're free I could use a friend Just to talk to me
Do you ever get those feelings like everything is wrong with your life, even though everything is right? I feel like I'm not the person that I am. Like the life that I'm living isn't mine, it's someone elses.    I cannot focus here, I cannot find my way My mind is blurred by all the things that people say I dream of bliss, I dream of heaven here on earth Won't you please set me free
W00P, only ten more days until the Sister Hazel & Dexter Freebish concert, and I'm stoked! I can't wait. It's gonna be a kickass concert.

How sad is this? I've become so bored in the past week that I actually put my picture up on one of those "hot or not" type websites. It's kinda cool though. I've managed to meet a couple really cool (and not so cool) people. Evidently a lot of people think I'm either really hot (they gave me a 10), or think I'm really ugly (they gave me a 1). Oh well, can't please everyone.
I think I need to go to a quack. Honestly. Ever since I've bought my iPod, I've become obsessed with buying music on iTunes. So far I've bought a little under 100 songs off of iTunes, and I don't see myself stopping anytime soon. It's just so easy to do though. I hear a song on Z995, and all I have to do is go home, open iTunes, click on the song, and it's automatically on my iPod so I can hear it anywhere I want.  urlLink To prove my point, let's take a look at my inbox, shall w
