i have to admit semi-comical)? anyone...    i mean did she really think, that after not talking to me for a year and a half, (ignoring my email and calls) that just because she emails me and FINALLY lets me know why she is 'upset' with me that it would all just go away and be ok... did she forget cathy 101? cause you know what... i don't work that way...   if there is one thing i have learned in the last 4 years of my life :: life is way to short :: - i don't need someone in my life that wastes a year and a half over something so petty as not being a brides maid in her wedding (cause i couldn't afford to), however i did pay $300 per plane ticket for me and gwenn to be able to be there.. apparently that means nothing, along with ten years of frienship.  yes, apparently she is that superficial... anyone...
