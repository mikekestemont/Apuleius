don't like his type of music...but i guess it was ok...sorry. But that night was probably the most fun ive had all summer. I hadn't ever hung out with the older youth...they are very very fun. It was me Tyler, Nick, Jana, Jakob, Alicia, Shelly, and Craig, fun fun times. I was sooo tired this morning though...cuz i went to bed at 3:30 and had to get up at like 8:00...ok yeah yeah i got 4 hours...but that not enough for the cranky melinda...she gets cranky without atleast 6 hours of sleep. But she has gone away now...thank goodness. Well im out now. See you guys later.
Thursday nothing really happened whatsoever until bible study. We are doing a bible study on the book "It's not about me". I really enjoy reading and studying that book. If you haven't read it and like to read...I would suggest that...its not just a book to occupy your time, it also is a learing experience in the making. Some of the things might go over your head in the beginning but they all tie together. Yes I have been reading that book instead of my summer reading...but im sure the book is a million times better than my summer reading books...and im getting way more outta the book than i would get out of "As I Lay Dieing" I mean come on...that book will probably make you wish you were dead instead of reading it. After bible study was over Tyler came over...i hadn't spent time with him in a while...so i really enjoyed that. And that is about all that happened on my eventful Thursday.
Well my day started with taking my mom to the doctor to have surgery on her ankle. The surgery went very well and will hopefully heal quickly...keep her in your prayers. I didn't know if I was gonna stay for the lock-in or not...but im glad I did. We had alot of fun...from relay races to eating creamed spinch baby food...ugh. I did get pretty sleepy towards the end and I would have done anything (even ate vienna sauage) to go to sleep. I got home at 7:00 am and slept until 2:30 pm...I sure did get alot of sleep.
Sorry i haven't updated in a while...but ive been pretty busy. I was supposed to be in Kentucky...but our trip got cut short because my mom broke her ankle. So we had to come back home and thanks to Tyler and Jan we got home safe. Ive been pretty bored besides that eventful day. I went to Stone Mountain with some friends on Saturday without Tyler cuz he was at the lake...i was pretty sad the whole time...so that wasn't good...but the laser show was awesome and so were the fireworks. Today i went to bible study which lifted my spirits and Tyler came home from the lake so that just made the day alll the better...i missed him alot. Well i better go now im hungry cuz i haven't had supper and its 11:00. I'll update again soon i p
