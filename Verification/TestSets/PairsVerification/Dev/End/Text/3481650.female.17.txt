himself, because he thinks it's a beautiful thing. I know you're thinking, "Wow, Lisa, why would you talk to him after hearing that?" I could never do that... stop talking to someone just because of all that. And if they live in Alaska, that's far enough away for me. And he doesn't make me feel bad, he doesn't make me doubt my beliefs. So, why not? Okay, I guess I need to read :P I wonder if I could do it all in one day? Maybe... tomorrow? Tyson wants to see The Village with me tomorrow night, and I really want to see it to.  Right now I'm listening to Celebrity Jeopardy, and ....What is Light Urple? I'm gonna go. Bye Bye
I finally spoke at High Pointe. It really wasn't that bad. Actually, when I got to sit down, I thought, "That was it? I wanna do it again!" So if I get the chance again, I'll know it isn't that bad. I really think God did something in me, because I didn't look nervous (so I hear.) I asked Mary if I could not wear shoes, and she said not to. At the last minute, I decided it would be better if I did, but I wasn't wearing them because I don't like wearing shoes when I'm sitting down (I really don't like them in general,) so when she told me to go up there, I forgot them. I think it was for the best though. I didn't want to wear them anyway. While I was speaking, my tongue got tied and I made a "pleh" sound to get it straightened out... People laughed. I got so many people coming up to me afterwards telling me that I did so good, which made me feel really good about it. Blair came up to me and said she teared up a little, which I was glad to hear, because I didn't think that my testimonial could make anyone feel anything. Anyway, enough about that. After High Pointe, Zane asked me if I was going to BCS to play "volleyball," and I said yes, and smiled very big, but I don't think he noticed. It was really a party for his birthday that was Friday. He was surprised, and all dressed and ready to play. It was Shanna's idea to get him a guitar, which was suuuch a good idea. The church bought it, and a lot of people signed the case, but I didn't get to. Maybe sometime this week. I really wish Zane didn't have to leave, he is such a great Christian guy. I know plenty of Christian guys, but not all that many that have a heart that reflects so much of God. He leaves next Sunday :\ Tomorrow (well today) I am going to the church again to film the Girls' retreat commercial. It's going to be good, we are using the Six-Flags commercial music. Ahh this is long, and I want to talk to Jose, and go to bed at the same time, so I'm o
