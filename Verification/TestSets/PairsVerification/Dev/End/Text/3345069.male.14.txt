Visit  urlLink here  for the full story. But basically a man in Oslo, Norway walked into a McDonalds, dressed as Ronald McDonald and started yelling about how he disapproved of McDonalds policies. He was asked to leave, he refused. He was then arrested in front of all of the people eating there which included children. Its a sad world we live in, I mean someone tried to impersonate a clown. I think that's as low as you can go. But it made for a funny story. LOL
There is nothing to do here. Im not exagerating. No one is home so, I can't get a ride to go anywhere, no one is on AIM, and I'm sick and tired of my video and computer games. I hope to God that someone signs on or my parents get home so I can go somewhere, otherwise I'm gonna have to start reading that piece of crap they call Anne Frank's Diary.

SpiderMan2 the game is definately one of the best video games in a long while. It has nearly no load times when you enter or exit a building, which is amazing, not to mention a time saver. And it's so complicated, I mean I've played it for just over 4 hours and I've only finished 19% of the game. Another good thing is in the game there are chanlenges, so even after I finish the story I'll still have something to do for a long time. This is definately a good game, nearly as good as Vice City, which has awesome cars and tanks and stuff.
Well its Independence Day. I want to thank all the members of the American armed forces. You have all done a great service. You have risked your lives in order to preserve the freedoms that we all enjoy. THANK Y
