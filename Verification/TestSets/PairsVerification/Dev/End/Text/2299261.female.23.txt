be consistent? What is delight, anyway? I imagine a little boy in kindergarten--the look on his face and the emotion in his heart--when his mother returns to pick him up after his first day of school. Or the face of a new bride on the dawn of the first day with her new husband as they awake entangled in each other's embrace. Or perhaps the feeling you get when you're zooming through the air on Dragon named, "Ice", going millions of miles an hour...I dunno.  What I do know that delight involves an incredible rush...a rush of emotion, physical motivation, and spiritual satisfaction that can only come from above. The hebrew word for delight is,  anag,  and it means literally,  "to treat the object of your affection with delicacy. To be happy over, to take exquisite delight"  (Strongs Hebrew Dictionary). It's how you respond when the sweet touch of Jesus reminds you that He's in control, and whatever it is that we feel you have to figure out, the outcome will be good, because He is good. Then the result of that rush, is His desires for our lives becoming reality. If we could make it an equation, I totally believe it would be:    Surrender + Delight = Desires        When we completely surrender, our next response tends to be looking into the face of the Lord, and then comes the rush...the delight of His presence, His touch, His smile. Then...oh, the desires that perhaps you've forgotten start to flood your mind and heart. You're reminded of what it is you've been created to do or be. You're reminded of the dreams He planted in your heart years ago. And the circumstances of that particular moment, "happen" to line up perfectly with those dreams. And it clicks. Checks right in your spirit. And you think to yourself, "This is it. This is from Him. It's right."  As I stumble through the lines in trying to describe what this past week has been like, I am confident that for the first time in an entire year (if not more) I have   peace  . The kind that surpasses your understanding. I'm sure that Geneva is where I'm supposed to be...and I'm sure that the time of "waiting" is finally over. "Waiting Well" is a discipline I hope to always practice, but the specific command to wait on going to seminary and pursuing teaching is finally over. I've been given the "go" by the Lord. He's opened a door and is leading me through it. It's amazing.  So...that probably leaves most of you with the question, "Well, what about Student Venture?" The answer...I'm going to remain doing the things I do with them but just not on staff. Ministry with SV is definitely a priority in my life and heart...but I've discovered a turn in the road, and I cannot  not  turn...  So, here's to the next season! Delight with me...discover His desires for our lives...and follow your dreams when they finally come (or come  back ).  With one hand in His, Leslie Diane :
