more and more inclined to give them what they want.  In an interview with the Morgunblaðið newspaper (where I, incidentally work) the minister for trade and industry, Valgerður Sverrisdóttir, said today:  "I think the Americans should do something about the logs in their eyes before bothering us about any splinters that might be in ours."
John Kerry is no idol of mine but  urlLink this  really is beyond the Pale (emphasis mine). "A Catholic lawyer has filed  heresy charges  against Sen. John Kerry with the Archdiocese of Boston, accusing the Democratic presidential candidate of bringing "most serious scandal to the American public" by receiving Holy Communion as a pro-choice Catholic."

The Bank of Iceland raised interest rates yesterday by 0.5% and they now stand at 6.25%. This is the third rate increase since early May when the rates stood at 5.3%. The hike itself did not come as a surprise to analysts, but in general they were expecting a smaller increase than half a percentage point. The Bank of Iceland is expected to raise interest rates again in the immediate future, as inflation is reaching the upper limits set by the bank.

William Sutton, the mysterious Icelander, kindly pointed me to an  urlLink old post of his . It's a must read; abso-bloody-lutely.
This is a poster made by the guys over at  urlLink catallarchy .  At the moment I am linking straight to the image on their server but when I get home I will move the pic onto my server so as not to leech to much bandwidth.  (Done) - The poster is a spoof of this one.    Update  Took out the link to jiffylux's image. Will host it on my server. Also took out the image made by catallarchy as there is another one out there which doesn't infringe on any copyrights, as I am informed that this one does. All this will be remedied later today (July 22. 2004).

"For the social problems: We demand:  a) The quick enactment of a law of the State that sanctions an eight-hour workday for all workers.  b) A minimum wage.  c) The participation of workers' representatives in the functions of industry commissions.  d) To show the same confidence in the labor unions (that prove to be technically and morally worthy) as is given to industry executives or public servants.  e) The rapid and complete systemization of the railways and of all the transport industries.  f) A necessary modification of the insurance laws to invalidate the minimum retirement age; we propose to lower it from 65 to 55 years of age." From the 1919 manifesto of the Italian Fascist party, written by Benito Mussolini. Sounds familiar don't i
