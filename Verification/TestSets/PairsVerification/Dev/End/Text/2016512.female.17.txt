terrible as it was i enjoyed it. now i realize that my standards were low as a child. and i don't like My Little Pony anymore. oh well there's still Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Jetsons, and Sailor Moon. *sigh*  Shame on, Shame on, -Betso
Well my week has been packed with mayhem and sand. i went to a miss crapsville meeting. after pondering the thought of being in the pageant for a couple days, i have come to the conclusion that i will not be. therfore, making the whole town happy by only having to see 11 peoples "talents" instead of 12. *shudder* that's a lot of young girls...i mean contestants. *wink* jk.  let's see what have i been up to. well, i've had the usual dance, band, and vball. all is well. dance practices are getting easier and easier, which sucks. marium's kinda given up on pushing us to our limits. she only does the stuff she likes. *shrug* band still sucks and somehow i'm not surprised. vball's gotten pretty ugly. we've had many an F-squared meeting between the team. it's good but depressing to think that i have to put up with the idiot for another year. we had league yesterday. it was fun we won 4 out of 6 games. 2 given automatically because a team didn't show. oh well. we won two. it was a lot of fun. i played left back and right all the way around. enjoyable!  i went to the lake on wednesday being as it's one of two free days i get. it was alright. kind of boring but i managed to get some reading done. i figure that me and Ashim don't have much incommon anymore. she came out with Lindy and hung out for awhile. i wasn't having much fun, but it was good to be outside and on the lake. thank you to Pulp County for the use of their shore!  that's about it. i'm trying to figure out what to do today. i'm free so far...crap that. i'm used to constant on the go, so this is new to me...and i don't like it. plans for the 4th: lake ahoy! i finished harry potter 4 and hope to start number 5 soon. untill then i'll work on the 8 other books i'm reading right now. sorry for the slew of useless information, but i lead a simple life i guess. no constant threats of insanity etc. my blog isn't even interesting to me. i should really just turn it into a calendar and mark things i did. grrr for my lack of creative writing.

well i'm just blogging because i don't have much else to do. i want to go do something active like tennis. if anyone wants to do something call me. i'll be more than happy to play tennis or anything really. as long as it doesn't require sitting and food. blegh. traveling sucks especially when it consists of hours in a car just sitting and maybe eating. well get back to me.  Breaker breaker, -
