of the tragic and shameful Iraq invasion imbroglio.  But he hasn’t. The Emperor has no clothes. There is not enough real benefit in this FTA for us. Even Vaile wanted no deal in the end – why are we all burying that recorded fact?  Ironically, the structure of this agreement – the small print - offers good prospect of benefits for US exporters and investors. Zoellick knew a good deal when he saw one. They are being offered preferential access to Australia’s national garage sale. Lots of good stuff to sell – but only one buyer, thank you – big, rich and white. You can see who will win there. No wonder the US Congress fell over itself to vote for this deal. As Zoellick murmured quietly, Australia offers "the low-hanging fruit", The Canberra Times' Jack Waterford reported the US diplomat as saying to him? "We like you Aussies, because you are such an easy lay". Thanks again, John, for taking such good care of us. There is no net benefit to Australia in this FTA. There is only farmer disappointment, and unacceptable risk, and loss of sovereignty. We do not need this so-called Free Trade Agreement.    urlLink Political drama without a happy ending  By Alan Ramsey July 31, 2004   Megan Elliott, executive director, Australian Writers Guild: "What is in this agreement for the US?

The detail of what the proposed FTA means for Australia's pharmaceutical benefits scheme and its consumers - the real detail - is a nightmare by comparison.    urlLink Picking the low-hanging fruit first  by Brian Bahnisch    What's in it for the Americans?   First of all there are strategic geopolitical considerations. You do not have sign up to every military adventure, but you do have to behave. New Zealanders need not apply. The US does see trade in terms of national security, indeed in terms of consolidating their hegemonic position in the world.  Second, the US will always act to further the interests of its corporations.   Third, this FTA is said to be the first with an advanced economy. (I'm not sure where that leaves Singapore!) As such it is important in setting standards for further deals, both bilateral and multilateral.   Anti-US? Most Australians would call it A
