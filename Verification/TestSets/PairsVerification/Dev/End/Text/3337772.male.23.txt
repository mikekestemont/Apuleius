is around, the leash goes to the friend so if it is necessary, he/she can take Lia farther away from me so she will not get hurt. That has yet to happen.  Do not deem me dangerous; do not think my lifestyle is dangerous for Lia... Because her safety is my priority, as well as our rights.
just a simple list, so you have an idea of what Lia can do.  Basic: come on - hurry up, you're too slow! let's go - when she sits down when i stop walking, i say this so she knows it's time to keep going... go on thru - go thru a door, turn around and watch me sit - duuur.... down - duuurr... stay - must I explain? Go potty - if you can't figure THIS out... come on! Leave it - dammit, I'm not explainin' no more... eh-eh (ny-ket, russian for no) stop whatever you're doing  look at me - dur.   Alerts: Say "jesse" 2 or more times, until Lia jumps on me and brings me to you. knocking - she barks, runs to the door, to me, to door. timer (microwave, oven, etc) - she jumps on me, takes me to the approximate location Alarm - this black dog loves to... paw... me... and whine... 'til I wake up. what?/kak (kak - russian...) - when she jumps on me, i say what or kak (russian for what) so she knows to take me to the sound. fire alarm - she will jump on me, go 'round, and lie down.  Others: take it - pick up object I point to and bring to me. "you wanna go? wanna go out? ya wanna go out?" - makes her hyper, jumps up and down, so she knows we're going outside... good girl/harashowa (russian)   Other alerts: - she, using her own canine brain, pulls at the leash to whichever elevator door is going to open... nifty. - whenever there are homeless people following me, yelling and begging for money, she will turn around while I walk, and then walk faster. - whenever I "clap" my right hand over my mouth, it means - feeding time! - she used to alert me to the phone, but most of the phone calls are for Lauren, so I stopped her on this.  - boxing, when she's hyper I'll pretend to fight her and she goes nuts and jumps on me.
Hence, all good things must have a beginning.  Here, you shall read rants and raves about 'dem dum-dums who either are 'fraidy of dogs, plain dum-dum, idiotic, or just overly illiterate that they shouldn't be in charge of businesses or public places.  Also contained in this blog will be posts about our daily lives, links to the ADA, service dog sites, and any dog related websites.  and we shall begin with a quote...  "People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion." - Albert Einstein
