this journal. Of course if the song makes me feel someway about what's going on in my life at the moment, I might let  that  slide. I learn from the Bastien Piano books series. I'll post a list of the books I have if anyone wants them (that's only about 6 or 7!). And I should post practice everyday, except Sundays. Rarely do I practice on Sundays.  So i hope that you find my blog slightly helpful in your musical journey!  :) HAVE A GREAT DAY! AND PRACTICE!  Oh yeah and if you want to drop me a line, my e-mail is Godsdude4life@hotmail.com
Ok so I haven't posted in a while, and I'm going to be very honest why. Well it all started when my computer got stolen!... just kidding! The real reason is because I haven't practice but twice in the last 2 weeks. I know it's terrible, but I've really been busy. I need to find time though. I really don't have time enough to do all that I need to do in a day!!    &nbsp;  Anyway today I finally practiced! It felt really good too. So here it is:    Scales  - All were shocking-ly well. I mean I didn't falter on any of them. I was happy. :)    Cadenses  - It was really scary, but all of these were really good, too!    Hanon  - Really gave me a work out.   You miss a lot when you don't practice!      Technic  - Now I did have a little trouble on my inversions the first time, mainly because I looked. Yeah I know Ms. Rhonda. Anyway after that I played them very well. "Snowmobiling" was ok. it wasn't great but it wasn't terrible, I just need to work it back up.    Piano  - Ok here is the very rich part of my practice! On "Reville", I faltered not once! I KNOW!!! AHH! I was happy. I played it perfect. I didn't have to look at my left hand, when I moved it. Whew that just makes me happy.    &nbsp;  And that's all I practiced. Now I have to work on Master's Class homework, which is to write music to the story Ms. Rhonda gave us. I really have a hard time at this stuff.    &nbsp;  So hopefully I'm back to inspiring you to practice! Hey don't roll your eyes! :) Just kidding.
Hey everyone!  Finally I get to post. Sorry that I haven't posted in a few days. I guess the server has been down or something because I haven't been able to log in. Anyway I'm not going to post all of that practice that I didn't get to post because it wasn't good practice. I mean I practiced, but everyday I continually got worse. So I don't think you would have been encouraged to practice!  But anyway. Today I'm really lost. See Ms. Rhonda told me not to practice this week because of what kept happening. So all this week I'm not going to be posting any practice because I won't be practicing! But I might post something so keep c
