Well I haven't blogged in a while cause there wasn't anything good going on or in that case anything at all, it's just been boring.  Well the Lightning won against the Flyers 2-1 so that means we're facing the Lightning in the Stanley Cups Final!! (By we I mean the Flames) We are gonna beat the jockstraps off those lightning players CAUSE WE ARE THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!  The long weekend was fun cause I went to Camp Bar-V-nok (It's a Ukrainian Camp for Youth.) It was a lot of fun cause we played a lot of Ultimate Frisbee, I did some soccer juggling with some of the guys, we had camp fires at night, we ate smores, slept in cabins (I was there for a grand total of 2 nights), we stayed up late, and we played some fun games!! The first day we got there at 7:30pm about so we really only had a camp fire and stuff like that. The second day we all had to get up at 8:00am and we did some church talk and stuff then we played Ultimate! It was fun cause I was got 2 TD's and a couple of good smack downs! Then we had more church talk and Sang ongs and Talked more. I played baskekball with my friends, and when we soccer juggled i got 20 bounces of my legs i one go!! Thats my new record!! Yay. There was this bike there and it was a really really really really really really really really crappy bike! With its completly flat tires no brakes and it being a real crappy color of green! But it was the "ghost bike" cause we would ride it real fast then jump off the back of the bike! The bike would keep going and if you were lucky it would keep going for about 4 to 12 seconds BY IT'S SELF!!! Then I rode it of a 2 foot drop and cause it had no shocks what-so-ever and this is a very small bike it hurt a lot then people started laughing at me and saying i was stupid:( Then my friend went and we laughed at him instead:) The weekend was lots of fun and I'm going back there this summer:)!!!  Keep on Rocking in the Free Word!!
