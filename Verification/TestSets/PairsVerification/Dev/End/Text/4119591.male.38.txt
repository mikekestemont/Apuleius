 urlLink story  on silicon.com:  The Finnish army is in a right old state if one official is to be believed. A bunch of young men are being excused from military service due to a debilitating modern illness - internet addiction. Apparently anything can be thought of as an addiction these days. Of course you might expect someone who uses the Internet as much as I do to be cynical -- obviously I'm in denial. I wonder if there's a support group for folks like myself who cannot seem to resist an RSS feed.  I'm a pretty busy guy... hopefully the Internet Addiction support group meets online.
There are just so many nifty things to mess with within Blogger. I've been goofing with this and changing that and I think I've got it all looking JUST SO. Unfortunately, now that I look at my web site, I think it looks like garbage by comparison.   No time to worry about that just now though. I've got a final philosophy paper to write and a psychology project to wrap up. Soon summer term will be at an end and I'll be able to frolic in the sunshine for a couple of weeks before fall semester starts. Oh joy is mine.
So, I'm going to try out this blogspot thing. If I like it, I'll move all of my previous posts here and make a link to this from my website.   UPDATE: Okay... er, that was easy.
It turns out that sharks live in the ocean and that they sometimes bite people.  urlLink Open Water  (based on true events) plays at an aquarium near you starting August 20. We'll rent it in October when it comes out on DVD.  ... or not. Time to get a bigger boat? (People say we're gettin' a little dinghy.)  Is it possible that the shark movie genre has already jumped the shark?
I think I can at last admit that I am becoming "old" in the sense that I no longer connect with or even recognize popular music. Some time ago (perhaps even as many as 15 years ago) MTV stopped playing music videos.  A friend of mind told me that they play music in the wee hours of the morning because the more expensive-to-produce talking shows don't find their audience at that time. I instructed my ReplayTV DVR to record a segment of MTV over night and, sure enough, the channel plays a good number of music videos over a period of three hours. Some of them are in such heavy rotation that you will see them twice in that time span. Anyway, that's when I realized that I had fallen completely out of touch with anything even remotely "youth-oriented." Long ago I passed out of the much vaunted 18-34 year old demographic and so too passed beyond the grasp of this channel with which I once connected so well. I did like most of what I saw however -- even though I had not a clue who the artists were.  Darned kids. ;-)  PS: Hey, I miss  urlLink Martha Quinn .
