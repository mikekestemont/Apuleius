much as your method of advancement allows, i.e. a quick advance means you check very little where as a secure method means you check everything.   The ability to react and adapt to situations is probably the most defining element of a good, solid clan. The laws of physics can be applied to pretty much everything in real life, even CS. To every action in a match, you have to react to it. Every situation that unfolds gives you a choice of possible ways to adapt to it, each with their own eventual outcomes and consequences. The best way to think of this is to imagine a family tree. At the top, or beginning, you have a couple things you can do. As you move farther down, different groups of choices lead to their own groups of choices. This might seem a little complicated by the description, but rest assured it isn't as complex as it sounds. Anyways, let's say you have the given situation that you're playing as the CTs on de_dust2 and you're guarding bombsite B. If your teammates go down in bombsite A, then that means you are met with a situation you have to adapt to both as a team and as an individual. When this situation comes about, you have the choice to either try to enter the other site from the middle area or from the dark split-level hallway. You can enter the middle area via either the catwalk or the CT spawn and the hall by the catwalk. You have to take into account how many enemies are left, what guns they most likely have, where you think they will be in and around the bombsite, how many teammates you have left and their weapons, and the time you have left to defuse the bomb. The more you play, the more subconscious these decisions will come about. For most people, these come in about a couple of seconds, but as you progress as a clan it will be almost instantaneous. Most of this comes from logic and experience, however.
