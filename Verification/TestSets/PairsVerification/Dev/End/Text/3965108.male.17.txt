is so much better than one that just wants them for cheap thrill. But that is why things went nad between us. I picked up on eo fhis girls. I'm not sure which was the first but i do know that Cora was the last. And when i seemed to steal Amber away from both of them it made him furious. But that was then. Now he's a low class street punk that thinks he's a revolutionary. He carries a pellet gun and brandishes it like a 9mm. He beats on his family, women included. And tried to stab Meg the other night. Our mutual friend Amanda still believes in him though i can't see why. He's not who i knew and with out Endy or i there to keep him in check he runs rampant. It makes me angry now that when i go back i can't touch him for fear of going back to jail.  Because he is a minor i have to let him hit me 3 times before i can defend myself. And three hits is to much with him. His honor is gone. That much i can see clearly now. He acts tough but he's only been to jail once and tries to lie abot a few more times. I've really been there. Juvy and county included and i know that if he goes to county he has a serious wake up call ahead of him/ Its a shame to because he has the potential to be a real decent human being.      Now to reply to a couple comments:   Cora you never told me you web site. I need it to go there. I only update when something is on my mnd or some thing interesting happens.      Hateamo: If that ever happens i will be suprised. You know what happens when i turn 27. It's definate now. i cant get away from it. Oh and i need the addy to your blog again/      Amber: I have been doing soe thinking and while i love you with all my heart i cannot promise fidelity while i am away. Based on my track record i have about a 90 percent chance of loosing. I leave the decision to you weather or not you still love me but i promise you i will at least try my best to stay true.      Lynne: I didn't do this to be comended or for it to be a diary. I did this because i have a serious problem with telling people what's going on inside my head. I do this so i can tell people what i can't bring my self to say. So don't give me any credit beyond that.      To any one else: Thank you for reading and keep commenting so i get some feed back. In one or two cases your advice has helped me a lot. I will try and post a current pic as soon as i figure out how so you can get a better i dea of who i am. Thanks and keep reading.      8
