people. So forgive me if you don't get an email at first. Kenny will fill in the gaps. (I hope.)  -sze
So. I was sitting in my Japanese traditional art lecture* and reflecting on the chat I had with Kenny last night. He had the laptop on and was casually checking his MSN Messenger contact list. It was huge. And they were filled with the names of people that I used to know or at least had nice recollections of hanging out with at IH. I mused on his insane popularity and realised that, as shitty an emailer as I am, I could never quite keep up the level of contact with everyone as he has. Or be as devastatingly charismatic (heh) as he is.    Therefore, I'm going to exploit Kenny. I will  make  him post here, and get him to invite all you nice-pretty people down here to post once in awhile and comment on the posts so everyone can keep in touch. And so I can stop sitting on my fat behind**, feeling sorry for myself that I will have no friends left when I finally do leave ih. I'm going to start up the first bunch of emails myself. And hopefully, most of you will eventually respond and post your updates here for everyone (though mostly me at first I suspect) to read.   Btw, this is Sze Lynn here. I am the Singaporean girl who's slightly tall, has dyed hair and mumbles incoherently. and uh, I'll send you a picture if you still have no idea, just click on the comments box below and leave your email. And if you still can't recall, for god's sake,  pretend  you do.  And if by some wonderful miracle this takes off, I'll get some techno whiz to build another page where everyone can leave their pictures and introduce themselves.   Thank you.   ( note: as of post-time, kenny has not read this yet. but he WILL cooperate. I hope. )  *the lecture is boring. my grades aren't good. **neutered for sang mi

I'm seriously considering a trip down to Bangkok this July... could I please see a show of hands as to who will be in Bangkok during this time, and when exactly, and what they're going to do for accomodation (those who aren't living there)?  Thanks so much..   ... And oh yes, Apple, now that you're working, when will be the best time for me to come by and meet up with you?
