I really enjoy people.    I've been exploring the area  a bit.  It's strange because I lived in this area until I was 5 and then we moved away..  now i'm back.  I live on the old side of town so there are a few quirky things to be discovered.  A week ago I snapped a photo of this old abandoned factory  with a large sign at the top that says, "Ramona's Plush Toy Co."  It made me smile.  This tea has warm fingers that slipped up inside my head.  They've attempted to soothe my brain.    I have so many things to do in various places..  at my old apartment, here at the new house, at my parents' house, etc.  My dad totally stood me up after he'd said he'd help me move and he called yesterday demanding I get over there as soon as possible to help him move.  My mom insists that I tell him no after he was shitty to me but I told him I'd help.  I haven't even mentioned him lying to me and then not helping me a single bit.  He knows he did it but I feel like he should know that I'm aware of it as well.  Yuck.  The whole thing is just messy.  It's only going to get messier for awhile.  July 30th was my parents' 30th wedding anniversary.  Um..  Nobody Celebrated.  heh.    god.  i'd rather be writing about sex.  and i'm sure you'd rather be reading about sex..  or having sex.  heh.    I can't believe it's August 3.    i want a dog so bad.  Will you make me another cup of tea?
wow.  It's August.  i'm sitting indian style on the floor of my bedroom.  strange things happen to the lights when i plug in my computer in the little "office" room and thus, i'm here for now.  it's quite the dilemma.  There is not nearly enough space in here amongst my other things to fit a computer desk and computer.  dreadful.  regardless of all that, though..  it's nice to be coming to you from my own computer at my own house, not some whacked out, security-ridden one at the libary.  ugh.  however, i will admit i was enjoying those nerdy trips to the library.  i checked out some more books.  mmm..  unfortunately i've not had a lot of time to delve into them just yet.  things are just in upheaval all over the place.  mom is moving.  dad is moving.  my best friend just moved.  and i'm actually still trying to finish up the moving i had to  do.  my apartment is in disarray..  as is much of the rest of my life at the moment.  i hope you are well and perhaps i'll write something interesting later.  i spent the night at my former apartment last night and have not yet slept.  i was quite productive and was out mowing the yard at 7:30 this morning but now it's all hitting me..  bowling me over and shoving me into my bed.  i'm tired and not feeling well.  hm...  back later, p
