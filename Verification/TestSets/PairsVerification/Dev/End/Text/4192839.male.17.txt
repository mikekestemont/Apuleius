: "'That's why you've got to be careful about this rhetoric, we're only going to tax the rich. You know who the--the rich in America happen to be the small business owners. That's what that means. Just remember, when you're talking about, oh, we're just going to run up the taxes on a certain number of people -- first of all, real rich people figure out how to dodge taxes. [Laughter.] And the small business owners end up paying a lot of the burden of this taxation.' "   Bush made this comment in one of his "town hall" meetings.

Mr Allawi brushed off criticism of the move, saying that the network's coverage of kidnappings encouraged terrorists.     I think that this is a dangerous precedent to begin, yes, they have a different view. But isnt that what news stations are about? Different news stations provide different views.
