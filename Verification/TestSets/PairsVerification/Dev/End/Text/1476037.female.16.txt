for starters.  He comes into Milwaukee and thinks he can take it over.  He says that Richie doesn't matter and the fans won't miss him that much.  HELLO!  It's the name of my blog.  Of course I'll miss him.  Then people think he is the best player when he's just lucky every time he gets a hit and the umps don't hate him like they did Richie for no reason.  I'm sorry Lyle but you'll never match up to my Big Sexy.  The other person I could go on with forever.  Without him I would still be playing and loving softball.  The hours he has made me cry in one day is greater than Schroeder has ever done to me.  If I could tell him what I want to to his face it wouldn't be a pretty sight.  He also thinks he's all that when really he's in the past.  He truly is a dinosaur and a jerk.  When he cut me I was pissed and I still am.  That's why I haven't returned my equipment.  HIs slaves are just as bad for not standing up for themselves.  Well that was my rant post.  I was thinking about it last night.  On a happier note I had a dream that Sarah was stood up at the altar wearing a really old fashioned slutty white ensemble.  FUNNY!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY SCHROEDER!!!!!!!!!! I've officialy liked him for 4 years now.  That's is depressing.  I realized yesterday that as of a week a go I've known him for 8 years.  I've liked him for one-fourth of my life.  AHH!  So other than that.  All I've been doing this summer is playing volleyball and helping with band camp.  I can't find a job anywhere.  Sarah comes back today and we're gonna play tennisofleyball.  I wonder what he's doing for his b-day.  Anyway.  Last night Becca, Derek, and I went to his cousin Scott's house.  Scott was very nice looking but I payed more attention to Ryan.  Hehe.  He was cute.  We played ping-pong together for like an hour and it was fun.  Hehe.  Him and Scott were really really good and I sucked but he said I didn't and I was like "awwww! you're cute!"  I didn't actually say that of course.  Who do you think I am?  Well I better go cuz I have to teach little incoming frosh how to march.  Tschus!
I just finished teaching band camp and Mr suave is taking us out to DQ in ten minutes!  We were marching a parade and guess who completely through off my step?  Schroeder came out from working out.  He was hot!  HEHE! I've decided that I'm gonna put my top ten hottest guys on here so here goes.  1.  Schroeder of course  2.  Richie Sexson   3.  Josh Groban  4.  Ryan Phillipe  5.  Hayden Christenson  6.  Topher Grace  7.  Orlando Bloom  8.  Andy Roddick   9.  Donald Driver        10.  Timothy Goebel  Well I gotta go eat ice cream so bye!  This'll probably be my last job for a while.  If anyone can find me a job  H
