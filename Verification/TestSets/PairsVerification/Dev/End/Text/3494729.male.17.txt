I'm going to have to pass. I don't want a shirt with 3 panels of some stick figure cartoon, I don't want a shirt that misspells Hooked on Phonics, I don't want a shirt that has some "clever" one liner or pick up line on it, or one that attempts to make people think I'm a sociopath with voices in my head. Maybe I'll just have to stick with my A) Red, B) Blue, and C) Gray Aeropostale shirts for another year. I don't mind.  -alex
The only problem I've run into with the blog so far is that I know, for the most part, who all reads it. Because I know this I tend to tailor the blog to these people, and instead of writing whatever is on my mind I have to avoid anything that may be awkward or offensive to these people. It's kind of a minor thing but, on some levels, it's defeating the basic purpose of the blog. If you have to ask yourself "Is he talking about me?", the answer is yes. This doesn't mean I'm going to stop or significantly change anything but it is simply a small source of frustration for me.  -alex
I just want to thank Justin, Steve, Katie, Emily, Ben, Lauren, Lisa, my parents and grandparents, and the mystery cell phone caller at 8:09pm for making me feel good on my birthday. It means more than you think.  -alex
Who Cares? Award : MTV. I don't care about Nick and Jessica's life, or what everyone's house looks like, or the Diary of so and so. "You think you know, but you have no idea, and you probably don't want to."   Most Played Show : The Ashlee Simpson Show. I don't even need to explain this one, you know it's true.   Late Night Award:  Conan O' Brien. How can you go wrong with a show that plays Walker, Texas Ranger clips as a comedy routine? Plus Leno and Letterman just aren't funny.   Worst Commercial:  YJ Stinger Energy Drink. Mmmmm, I really want to drink something that explodes with bees when I open it. Plus it's an energy drink.   You're Cool, But Not That Cool Award : People who watch The Daily Show. Granted Jon Stewart is hilarious and the show is great, but watching the show doesn't make you "unique" or "hip". It seems like a lot of people think they're "underground" because they like the show. News flash: everyone watches it, everyone likes it, you're not that cool.   Re-run the Re-runs Award:  Bravo. Bravo's lineup consists of three things: The West Wing reruns, Queer Eye for the Straight Guy reruns, and Celebrity Poker Showdown reruns. Even though I love the West Wing, I can only watch the same episode once or twice a day before I'm tired of it.  I'm going to add more as I go.  -alex
This is simply the most creative thing I have ever seen on the internet. Note that the cow is referred to as a "he", yet has an udder. Hmmmm. Enjoy.  "Bad cow pun..."   urlLink http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/cowswithguns.php   -
