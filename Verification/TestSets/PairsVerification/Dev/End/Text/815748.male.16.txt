diplomatic solutions, we should bomb everyone that hates us into submission and make everyone else fear us.  Right.  I don't even know where to start, that's just... dumbfoundingly stupid and dangerous.  The thing about terrorism is, you can't kill every last one of them, and the more you bomb countries in the Middle East, the more Middle Easterners hate us and start supporting terrorism.  Many such countries, as Iran, which has hated us intensely since the Carter Administration, have nuclear weapons, so preemptive military action might not be the best first option.  I really hope she isn't representative of her party, or the United States -- and the world -- are in serious trouble.  Melody got me  The Question of God: C. S. Lewis and Sigmund Freud Debate God, Love, Sex, and the Meaning of Life  by Dr. Armand M. Nicholi, Jr.  It's pretty good so far.  That was very thoughtful of her.  It's good that she brought that over, too, because I just finished  Give Me a Break  by John Stossel.  It reminded me of similar books I've read including  The O'Reilly Factor  by Bill O'Reilly, and  In Our Humble Opinion  by Tom and Ray Magliozzi.  Mr. Stossel, the co-anchor of ABC's "20/20," has some very provocative themes, such as the case for limited government since the free market always effects ultimate progress and superiority over bureaucratic programmes.  He also details the problem of media exposure to relatively insignificant threats, argues against the exaggeration of the benefits of organic food and the threats of global warming by environmentalists, and realizes the folly of illicit drug criminalization.  It's a very provocative read.     Yesterday, I went to "I, Robot" with Jonny.  It was a pretty good movie, and it was fun.  I've gotten into Nerds Ropes even though they're trayf because of gelatin.  W/e.  Not much else is going on; I'm too busy procrastinating from doing IDs/Spanish.  Talk to you later.
On Friday, I saw "Garden State."  It was very good.  Although there were flaws, they were acceptable since this was Zach Braff's first movie, and since its beauty and spectacle decisively outweighed them.  Yesterday, Jonny and I went to Rockport.  That was fun, notwithstanding some vomitrocious occurences.  I wish I could have stayed there longer.  We saw "De-Lovely," which reminded me of how bad movies could get.  It also reinforced my opinion of music from musicals.  I won't get too specific, but let's just say it sucks more suckily than the suckiest suckfest that ever sucked.  Yeah, I know, I've used that phrase too much.  Today (after returning from Rockport), I saw "The Hunting of the President" at the Coolidge Corner Theatre, the only location near me at which it's playing anymore.  I liked it; its points were much less far-out than "Farenheit 9/11" (whose message was nonetheless true), and I think all or the far majority were accurate.  If Steph had gone to it, though, she probably would have exploded Ã  la fembots.  Tomorrow, I hope to start my work.  I also hope to write something.  We'll see how those g
