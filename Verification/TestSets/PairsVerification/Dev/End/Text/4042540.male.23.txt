hipster (Mario Kart, anyone?)."    That's kinda odd because I don't really drink coffee or smoke. But I do enjoy Mario Kart now and then...
Oh yeah, and here's my latest article for Somethingcool News, entitled "The Cell-phone Addiction."&nbsp;&nbsp;  urlLink http://www.somethingcool.ca/secondary70.htm     "His name was Sven. Or maybe it was Hans. Either way, he was a German visiting Canada with a friend that happened to be at this event and who found himself in a conversation with me. I remember it was going well, as his English was much more understandable than the tight sweater he was wearing. At one point I felt my pager begin to vibrate in my pocket, and I casually retrieved the device to view the incoming phone number. Much to my surprise, the German laughed incredulously and remarked, "Is that a pager? I did not know they still made those!" He then insisted on fondling it like a relic from the dark ages, little more than a quaint antique. And I couldn't help but wonder whether I had been insulted by the new breed of elitist - the technology snob. " I was a little worried about writing this article actually, because people can be pretty protective of their technology.&nbsp; And then there's the hypocrisy aspect -- as my argument asserts that people who love this type of technology are addicted to it -- because I probably spend at least ten hours per day in front of a computer screen.&nbsp; (Granted, 8 of those hours are at work.)&nbsp;&nbsp;   That's it, time for the beach.
Well here I am trying out the new blog.&nbsp; I'm actually not sure why I didn't open up a Blogger account before, seeing as how this is much easier than creating my own blogging page.&nbsp; I think I was just generally conflicted.&nbsp; On the one hand, there's the people that say doing this is pointless unless you're someone famous or have a unique point of view.&nbsp; Otherwise, who cares what I think about stuff?&nbsp;   Then again, what justifies doing anything at all?&nbsp; Money?&nbsp; Fame?&nbsp; If so, then there are a lot of things in this world that would never have happened.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure it was Stephen King who wrote a nice piece of advice to aspiring writers.&nbsp; He said that if you write for money, you'll never be able to write very well.&nbsp; But if you write for the love of writing, then people will take notice and perhaps riches will follow.&nbsp;   Anyway here's a good article.&nbsp;    The glorification of the "good war" persists on our television and movie screens, in the press, in the pretentious speeches by politicians. The more ugly the stories that come out of Iraq – the bombing of civilians, the mutilation of children, the invasion of homes, and now the torture of prisoners – the more urgent it is for our government to try to crowd out all those images with the triumphant stories of D-Day and World War II.
