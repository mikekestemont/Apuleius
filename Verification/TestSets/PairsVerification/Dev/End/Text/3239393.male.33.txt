perfect - a perfect focus, a perfect example, a living breathing example of what my faith should look like.  Who, cos of what he knew was to come - endured the cross - went through it cos he knew it was worth it - scorning it's shame - knowing that it was worth it.  Consider HIm - do not grow weary and lose heart.  It's quite that bad - but that is why i need to consider him know - so that I do not grow weary, so that I do no lose heart.  Consider.
