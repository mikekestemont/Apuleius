out and the music they played was Bon Jovi. Oh lordy. I forgave him for that since he's Russian and they really don't know any better.
Do ever get this immense feeling of dread whenever you remember a conversation you had with a person important to you (like a prospective employer or crush) and you think you said some incredibly stupid things that keep replaying over and over in your mind like a rash that won't go away and maybe days later you forget about it but you see or hear something that makes you remember it all over again and you want to purge the thought by banging your head against a wall repeatedly?  Yeah, me too.
I'm happy to know I've changed some people's lives (even just a little) through sharing my favorite music with them. I had a long talk with someone who prefers not to be named *hack*Claude*cough* about the catch 22 of our current similar situations. And she told me that whenever she felt particularly down about something she would listen to the CD I gave her! Aww! That makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside!   You're welcome girl-who-doesn't-want-to-be-mentioned-in-my-blog!  And because I'm in a somewhat good mood today here's a link to a wonderful cover of Britney Spears's "Toxic" by some guy named Michael Gum. Yeah, I've never heard of him either but his version is truly heartbreaking. Download it  urlLink here  (right click then choose "Save Taget As...). And  urlLink here  is a link to his Live Journal.

Here's a little quote from their intro page:  The Hedonistic Imperative predicts we are poised to explore a spectrum of outrageously beautiful states of consciousness. Potentially, states of consciousness far more sublime than today's fleeting "peak experiences" can become part of the texture of everyday life. The advent of utopian biotechnology permits our genetically enriched descendants to be animated by gradients of immense well-being - in contrast to our animalistic mix of pleasure and pain. In the new reproductive era of "designer babies", gradients of innate bliss can form the bedrock of invincible mental health.  Okay...  I've been reading some Isaac Asimov lately and this is the kind of thing he writes about in his novels about the future. He doesn't mention any "spectrum of outrageously beautiful states of consciousness" but apparently there's some kinky robot sex in our future.   If you don't want to search through pages and pages of new age quotes and pretty pictures of beach scenes and horses in the mist,  urlLink here's  the page of the m
