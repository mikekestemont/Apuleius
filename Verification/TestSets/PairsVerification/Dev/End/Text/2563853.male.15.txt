and prayer from you all, Leo will once again be in our homes 2 times a night.  Good night America.
My favorite tech host, Leo Laporte, no longer works at TechTv all thanks to Vulcan Ventures.  He was a huge lost.  He is the best and it will be hard to imagine TechTv without him.  It will be so sad.  It was hard enough when he left Techtv's The Screen Savers about 2 weeks ago on his own, but now Call for Help without him!!!  And this time it wasn't his choice.  They wanted to sign away all claims of some shares of stock or else he wouldn't have to worry about working for them.  He stood by his principles, way to go Leo.  But now He doesn't work at TechTv, but hopefully when TechTv and Comcast merge they will rehire him.  To read all about this in his own words on his website visit  urlLink  .  He helped to build up the channel to what it is today and this is how they repay him!!  Good luck Leo we will be cheering for you.  Your the best, no one can replace you or your humor.  I hope in the future that you can get your job back and we will try our best to help.  Until then you can still listen to Leo on his radio show on  urlLink   and visit his site at  urlLink Leoville.com .
I haven't been able to post for such a while due to my webhost.  The ftp services are down even still.  Something is going to have to be done.  Oh well, I have switched to another host for this blog and plan to start to post a lot more.  Well anyway that is the reason for what was going on.  Also I have registered  urlLink http://www.drewtown.com/   that will link you to my home page.  You can email me at  urlLink andrewflanery@gmail.com .  Sometimes and more likely within the next 2 weeks to site could be shakey.  So if it isn't working just try again later.  Thanks again for all your support.
I have thought about it and have decided to give blogging another try. I will try to post every morning or afternoon, but it may become every other day. It is just as my schedule permits! I am also thinking of switching to a new blogging service, I will post more about that if I decide to. On a side note, keep watching for gmail invites for those who want them. You never know when they are going to be posted. Have a great day.
Well I thought about it and decided to post some Gmail invites on here, so all of you can enjoy Gmail. I will put them up randomly, so check back often. Don't give up, there will be more if you don't get it when you want it. And lets try to keep it to 1 account per person, so everyone can enjoy Gmail, the service that I feel in love with, and now you can too. Keep watching for invites ;
