七里香  七里香  詞：方文山 曲：周杰倫   窗外的麻雀 在電線桿上多嘴  妳說這一句 很有夏天的感覺  手中的鉛筆 在紙上來來回回  我用幾行字形容妳是我的誰   秋刀魚 的滋味 貓跟妳都想了解  初戀的香味就這樣被我們尋回  那溫暖 的陽光 像剛摘的鮮豔草莓  你說妳捨不得吃掉這一種感覺   雨下整夜 我的愛溢出就像雨水  院子落葉 跟我的思念厚厚一疊  幾句是非 也無法將我的熱情冷卻  妳出現在我詩的每一頁   雨下整夜 我的愛溢出就像雨水  窗台蝴蝶 像詩裡紛飛的美麗章節  我接著寫 把永遠愛妳寫進詩的結尾  妳是我唯一想要的了解   那飽滿 的稻穗 幸福了這個季節  而妳的臉頰像田裡熟透的蕃茄  妳突然 對我說 七里香的名字很美  我此刻卻只想親吻妳倔強的嘴  haas..jay chou's new song..qi li xiang, nt bad lar..lolx
江南  曲：林俊杰 | 词：李瑞洵 | 编：   风到这里就是黏 黏住过客的思念 雨到了这里缠成线 缠着我们流连人世间  你在身边就是缘 缘份写在三生石上面 爱有万分之一甜 宁愿我就葬在这一点  圈圈圆圆圈圈 天天年年天天 的我 深深看你的脸 生气的温柔 埋怨的温柔 的脸  不懂爱恨情愁煎熬的我们 都以为相爱就像风云的善变 相信爱一天 抵过永远 在这一剎那冻结了时间  不懂怎么表现温柔的我们 还以为殉情只是古老的传言 离愁能有多痛 痛有多浓 当梦被埋在江南烟雨中 心碎了才懂    this song realli rox...i luv it lolx..there is even a bk that is written base on this song, the author was inspired by his song to write the bk also called 江南..
