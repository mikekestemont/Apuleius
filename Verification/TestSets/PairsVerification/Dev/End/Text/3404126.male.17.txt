packet.&nbsp;  Tuesdays with Morrie  was mos def a quick, easy read;&nbsp; I annotated the whole thing last night in bed.&nbsp; Its unfortunate that I've started this late in the game beacuse I really wanted to read  The Fountainhead , but there simply aren't enough hours in the day.&nbsp; It seems that my 4 books that I'm gonna read are gonna be these:&nbsp;  Tuesdays with Morrie ,  The Stranger , that dorian gray book, and then one more, maybe siddharta ( :( ).  I got those AP scores back recently.&nbsp; I didn't do too badly, I think, although my scores aren't what I expected.&nbsp; I got a 5 in both Physics and Calc, a 4 in Comp Sci, and a 3 in APUSH.&nbsp; I guess the college board didn't approve of my clown essay that I wrote for them in the USH exam.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; I also thought that I would get a 5 in Comp Sci, not Physics.&nbsp; I was expecting Physics to be a 4.&nbsp;   I've wanted to modify my car for quite some time now, so today I sat down at my comp and researched exactly what products I wanted and exactly how much each of them costs.&nbsp; Much to my avail, the total cost comes to around $7, 000.&nbsp; Here a list of the parts a want (need): Sony CD/Mp3 Head unit, a 240-W amp, 2 front door Xplod speakers, 2 column Xplod speakers, Eibach Pro Lowering Kit, pre-painted Factory spoiler, SilverStar Halogen bulbs, Xenon Crusher body kit, Autotechnica Chrone shifter head, Saddleman Flames bucket seat cover (could be replaced with new racing seats), Edelbrock Performance headers, Whipple Supercharger, Plasma Booster Ignition chip, Heartthrob Performance dual exhaust system, and an Injen Air Intake system.&nbsp; Serious parts, heartbreaking cost.&nbsp;   That's life, -KC
Not much going on these days...hangin with friends, playin videogames, running, and goin to see movies.  Speaking of movies, I saw King Arthur yesterday night.  Bunches of people didn't like the movie and its probably because it wasn't what they expected.  When somebody says King Arthur, you think Knights of the Round table, Camelot, etc, but thats not what the movie really is about.  Its more historically accurate and portrays not the existence of Camelot, but the last days of Arthur under the command of Rome and the FOUNDING of Camelot.  Either way, it wasn't a great movie. : Ready for a sick joke?  So theres this hiker climbing a mountain, and he gets to the top only to find a beautiful girl standing at the edge of a cliff, ready to jump off. "Wow, a jumper.  Hey, you wouldn't mind giving me a last blowjob before you dive, would'ja?"  says the hiker. "Sure, why the hell not, life sucks anyways.  I might as well too."  So she gives the guy a blowjob.  When she finishes up, the guy looks down at her. "Wow, that was great... uh, why  are  you killing yourself anyways?"  The woman replies, "My parents disowned me for dressing like a woman."  AAAHHHHH EEEEWWWWW! XD  Definitely a mighty disgusting joke.  Sorry about that. -
