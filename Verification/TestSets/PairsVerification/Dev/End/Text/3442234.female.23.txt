been to a PawSox game so I was quite excited, plus it was free hat night to boot!  Rock on.  Ryan, Dulcina, and Ryan's friends Erik and Jenn, and I went to the game.  I was thrilled to see Brian Daubauch aka Brian "Cheech" Daubauch, which brings me to the title of this post.  For some reason all but 2 of the Paw Sox players looked Hispanic when their faces were shown on the big screen.  Daubauch looked the most Hispanic, therefore is the leader of the Pawtucket HisSox and aptly named Brian "Cheech" Daubauch.  The Sox didn't win, even though they played a really good game early on.  In the top of the 8th the Clippers went ahead, they tied it on a balk in the 7th.  The Clippers are the affiliate of the New York Yankees.    It was a fun night though.  We had park food, beers, made dirty jokes, made fun of people, and just enjoyed the overall feeling of summertime in New England at a ballpark.  There is nothing like it.
I'm extremely tired, so this post will just be a preview of the awesome weekend I had.  Awesome is the only thing that can describe this weekend.  A friend had a party on Friday night, so Friday after work I headed to CT.  Betsy sure knows how to throw a party.  Here is an overview: hot tub till 5am, drinking (see below for the list of drinks that I can remember), drunk strip asshole with ridiculous rules (good thing it was drunk, no one noticed I kept putting on more shirts and earrings counted as an item of clothing.  Needless to say, there was no nakedness), drunk swimming, good food, good music, getting 3 hours of sleep, lots of visiting and chatting and awesome people.    Saturday the fun continued, I woke up at 8 after 3 hours of sleep and soon headed home.  I was home for a whole 20 minutes before going to Boston.  We took the T in to Fenway and got a free Fenway tour where we touched the green monster that Johnny Damon runs into.  After that we headed to Newbury street and I got my green red sox hat for $11, and a fedora for $13.  We walked more on Newbury St. and visited CW.  Then we went over to The Wrap for a great lunch.  Then over to the Hatch Shell for free great music at the last dispatch show where I sweat like 8 pounds, like for real, it was sooo hot, and I was sooo gross.  After 3 hours of music, we left for home.  Once in Fall River I had a d'Angelo's #9 that totally hit the spot, and the best shower I've had in my life (I was soooo sweaty, sticky, and dirty), and to top it off some sleep.  Friday/Sat. morning drinks 2 Coors lights 2 Mudslides 2 Alabama Slamma's 1 Gin and tonic minus the tonic plus vodka 1 shot of Jolly Rancher 1 shot of vodka 1 something good that was white 2 S
