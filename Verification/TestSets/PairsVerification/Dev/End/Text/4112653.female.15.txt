yut yee sam...testing testing...one two three hi every1
if we're not supposed to have pre maritial *oomph* how does a pants on rule sound?
helloooooooo guys!! :D i'm @ school, i can read all ur blogs, but can't reply...     someone tell dan the words to the song.   and i'll figure out the website for tara's blog   luv y'all   h&k&atms,   von   { When you need me, I'll always be there }
Hehe...3 days and now we also have a prayer blog:  http://hsprayers.blogspot.com  you've all been sent invites. Let me know if your invite doesn't work - the only two people yet to set up accounts are Sherman and George. (Although we do have to wait until Cheuk figures out how to actually use his.)
well you see i wanted to start my own post thingy... so you all have to reply so it is cool. this blog thing is kinda classy... well it's my birthday in two days! im pumped. i gotta go to bed though. ciao now...  tara xxx
okay, cheuk says spam without him...i can't explain to him how to work everything...and somebody please confirm to me that   http://cheukycheungy.blogspot.com  does not work??
couple of things:  - the posts should be appearing in chronological order now, it's just that before the time zone for the spam blog was if we were in LA.  - we shouldn't need to worry too much about the colours, cos I'm not going to bother...something's wrong with my comp. But considering I'm using my rgwcb account, it should read "nay" in my signature. Nate's is "nay", mark's is "stooge 2", dan's is "the FLY", von's is "viciousdurian" ...we should be right.  - how is it possible that this whole blogging thing started like, 2 days ago.

we've made it so that you can contribute here, like write entries, on your own accounts. you just have to accept our invite that we sent you.  for those who don't have your own accounts, set 'em up. nay
we should all have colours so that we don't have to even read the spam to know who it's frm... it's all font/colour coded      and btw, guys, this is the only time i'm gonna encourage u to SPAM AWAY!!!! mega coolness!!      h&k&amp;atms,      von
