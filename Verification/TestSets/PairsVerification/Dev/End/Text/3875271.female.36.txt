am going to try to get that issue resolved next. Donna said we can have Angie's bed which is a queen for upstairs if it fits cause she never uses it, she would rather sleep in her big chair in the living room.       Then of course there is the waiting to try to settle my workers comp claim. The lawyers are working on it this week to advise me how to counter the offer that was made. With that settled we will have no debt other than the mortgage. What I would like to do is get someone to jus take over the mortgage on our house and then we can go right into daddy's with no debts.      I suppose time will reveal all that will happen and we need to take one day at a time and be patient and rely on the will of God. That's it for now, hopefully it won't take me so long to get back here and update next time!
Ok, well it's been almost a week since I last blogged. Um, Blake has had band camp all week so I haven't gotten to see him. I got Leah on Wednesday. We went to Hostetter's and bought the paint for the bathroom. I have 2/3 of the walls painted with primer so far.      Friday we went over to dad's to go out to eat. We discussed us moving in with him and eventually getting the house. It looks like we are going to do it. I don't see it happening until spring of 2005 though. We need to go see a lawyer to see how to go about it in the most cost effective way for everyone. I need to get my workers compensation settled first too. And then there is the issue of getting our present home sold. It would benefit us all all the way around without too much inconvenience. Loss of privacy would be the biggest for both of us but I think we can both find a compromise there.      I did receive an offer in the mail for settlement on Friday. I have to wait and talk to the lawyer on Monday but I think I am going to counter their offer for a bit more. If we could get $15000 more it would not only pay off all our debt but put 3 months wages in the savings for a buffer.   Michael said once that is all said &amp; done he wants to "live like old people." In the sense that we only buy things that we have the cash to pay for it outright. NO MORE CREDIT CARDS! It may have taken me 18 years but I have finally learned the life lesson on finances. I would like to incorporate the 10-10-80 plan into our budget as well. From your gross income 10% tithe, 10% savings and live off of the other 80%. You would be sitting well with that in place.      Well that's all that's is going on right now that is worth talking about. Until next time, C
