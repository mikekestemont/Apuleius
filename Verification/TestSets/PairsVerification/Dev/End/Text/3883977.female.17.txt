 :(  That is it.  I drank Crystal light raspberry lemonade all  day... free points.  Soda=  None ... hooray for me.  (dentist said no more soda... so i'll report that too)  Excersize:   none  unless you count painting.  my calves are killing me, and I sweat my ass off.. but I wouldnt really call it cardio.  1-10 scale of the day  (1 being super dieter- oprah, and 10 being  fatty fatty boobalatty- goodyear blimp) about a   6.5
What program are you on?   I am doing not a whole lotta anything right now.. hense this web community.   What do you want from coming here?  I would like to try and be better motivated.. and be held accountable. It really helps me to be motivated...   What works? How has it worked?  Weight Watchers works for me (when I am being good). I am not fully in it right now, but want to be.  Okay... that is it for introductions.
… that make the whole world sing. What statement could be truer when speaking of the legendary composer – Barry Manilow? Don’t scoff. Don’t scowl. No one person can deny the powerful stylings of Manilow. True – I am biased – I am a “Fanilow”. Some may claim to hate him, some may claim to despise. I challenge all of you non-Barry-believers to listen the Copa Cabana and not (in some way) groove a bit in your chair. You will sing along – oh yes – to Lola and her feathers. You cannot resist. Such is the power of Manilow.  Read the lyrics below to the most famous (and lovely) “Can’t Smile Without You”.  You know I can't smile without you I can't smile without you I can't laugh and I can't sing I'm finding it hard to do anything you see I feel sad when you're sad I feel glad when you're glad if you only knew what I'm going through I just can't smile without you you came along just like a song and brighten my day who would of believed that you where part of a dream now it all seems light years away and now you know I can't smile without you I can't smile without you I can't laugh and I can't sing I'm finding it hard to do anything you see I feel sad when your sad I feel glad when you're glad if you only knew what I'm going through I just can't smile now some people say happiness takes so very long to find well, I'm finding it hard leaving your love behind me and you see I can't smile without you I can't smile without you I can't laugh and I can't sing I'm finding it hard to do anything you see I feel glad when you're glad I feel sad when you're sad if you only knew what I'm going through I just can't smile without you  It really is a medley for life – the highs and lows of life can be enhanced with the lyrics to his songs. Barry has been there. Barry knows. Barry c
