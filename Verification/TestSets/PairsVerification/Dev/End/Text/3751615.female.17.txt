Today is Sunday and here I am sitting alone in my London's room (coz I'm right now staying at my flat in London). I'll be back to Jakarta in a few days. I wanna go to Stockholm and see grandma, but dad didn't allow me to. Well, coz of I'm not able to post my previous 'days' stories', i'm just gonna tell ya all what happened. &nbsp; As you know, 3 weeks a go I was still in a big conflict with mom and dad. I used to cry alone at nite at that moment. The 10th day I hadn't spoken with both of my parents, my dad came to my room... i didnt lock my room as i used to do coz dad hide it. He saw me cryin' that nite... he tried to get me talkin' but i was just so 'speechless' (wat ya can expect with 'heaps' of tears came out of your eyes?). Finally, I said some words... he listened and he hugged me. He asked me whether I felt like no one love me and I'm useless. He said it was just normal... especially after what I had with mom. He then went out and asked mom to come to my room.&nbsp; We sat on my bed and we talked. Mom was ill at that time, dad said that it was coz she was thinking about me. Deep inside, she felt guilty of what she'd done to me. After long talk... we finally got everything done. We now know what we want and each of us are trying to better. &nbsp; Not even a week after that nite... I went to London. I realized that I'd still had some money left and that's all are enough for a trip to London. I came to London for two reasons. First, I wanna meet my 'love' coz I miss him so much. Second... i got an appointment with some friends here. It's almost&nbsp;my second weeks in London. Erick wanted to come along, luckily he gotta make some photos for his fellows, then he couldnt go with me. But he borrowed my lovely notebook... 2 days a go, in a cloudy morning,&nbsp;I called him and asked him to send me my diary to my email, but he said that there's problems with the connection. Then in the evening my sister called me and said that my laptop is totally broken. All coz of Erick obviously...!!! &nbsp; By the way... I'm going to Leeds tomorrow!Yeepee...!! Uncle Fab isn't flying tomorrow then I can go out with him. If only he's not too lazy to take his wife and 2 children to London... we can go to picadilly and get sum good stuffs. But Leeds isnt too bad anyway... I wanna go to Halifax! The best city I've ever seen. Or maybe if Uncle Fab doesn't mind, he can drive to Bradford to meet some friends there... that would be loads of fun! &nbsp; Enough for today! Gotta do sumthing else now... go out and get sum foods! Starving me h
