religious guide even when you have no belief is not going to turn you into Jerry Falwell.  The problem comes in when Jerry Falwell writes the laws based on the literal Book and not just guidance in it's examples of goodness.
No stranger feeling than missing out on what is going on back home (yes I called it that).  Hearing about the wave of bombings and knowing I should be there makes me hope I wasn't really needed.  This latest incident brings home all the things I have been saying about the insurgents.  3 dead soldiers and 50+ civilians.  I think I'm going to force myself back early since my Father is getting better.  I miss my family but I still have a job.   What a fucking hero,  yawn.
The worst part about politics is the politics. (I work for the Department of Redundency Department) As a Veteran and an angry Cuban who doesn't trust either party I am having issues with John Kerry's speach at the convention the other night.  He said everything I agree with and I mean everything.  Now comes the tricky part,  the seminal politician.  This is the man who made up stories about the so-called atrocities he was aware of in Vietnam.  He has fellow Dem's at his rallies slapping beach sandles to symbolize his flip-flopping on issues.  He made fun of Edwards as not being able to carry his own state how can he carry the Country and now has him as a running mate.    Now it gets dicey.

During Vietnam the phrase,  "Better the son-of-a-bitch you know than the son-of-a-bitch you don't know" was thrown around.  Pres. Bush is not the grand jury prize but we know exactly what he will do in a given situation,  delegate to Cheney. (sorry)  But Kerry is so tricky in that his words say something that made me question my hatred of the Dem's for the first time in my life.  His voting record, as I have seen, Shows other than his words would elude.  People can change, insert leopard comment here.  The majority of the states are Conservative in general thought and to the left when it touches their home.  The middle ground is the way this country will recover.  Schools and poverty are real problems as are foreign policy and warfare.  Abortion is only an issue when it's your daughter,  and only gun owners(me) care about guns. When the politicos realize we don't care about the party and do care about the wallet and the brood they can have a White House where all of us feel safe and comfortable with its residents.  Even when Michael Moore comes to d
