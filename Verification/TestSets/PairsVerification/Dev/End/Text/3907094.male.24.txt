Well I picked up my free ticket and trottered off to cineworld today in anticipation of the latest M Night Shyamalan film called  urlLink    The Village     and well, hmmmm. It was O...K...it wasn't bad...but it wasn't great either. The idea was a good one but the tense moments seemed to run a bit dry sometimes. While some parts that could have been made tense and full of suspense just weren't. Another problem was that once you'd been sat there for 20 minutes you could kinda guess the entire film...that never helps. Maybe I expected to much, maybe I'm just being fussy seeing as I go to blockbuster films expecting entertaining tosh and go to the more original films to see something new. However, constantly I find myself disappointed by American cinema and I turn to Asian cinema to remind me that films can be more than just seat fillers for rich people.  On the whole though the village is a good film. The idea is good, and to a large degree plausible. The directing was good (as always) and some of the characters were amazing (Although seeing Sigourney Weaver in it was a surprise!). However, I felt there was something lacking...unfortunately seeing Joaquin Phoenix made me just wanna shout "swing away Merill! Swing away!" as well. All in all The Village gets a very entertaining 6/10.
Well it does if this is posted Joker  ===== "Could it possibly get any uglier?  I used to be a highly respected Watcher, and now I'm a wounded dwarf with the mystical strength of a doily."   		 __________________________________ Do you Yahoo!? Yahoo!
