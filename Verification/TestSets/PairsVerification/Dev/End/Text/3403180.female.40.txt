in November, and a popular fly fishing destination.  Kevin parked and I took the small trail to the riverside.  I found the small stream and saw fish swimming, Kevin soon followed to see for himself.  Well it isn't much........but not bad for desert Arizona, I guess. We then drove through the old copper mining town of Jerome, AZ.  We said we should spend a weekend sometime and walk through all the antique shops. We drove through Prescott, they were having a festival for the fourth. We got lost and found our way back to the freeway home. &nbsp; urlLink
urlLink     Home again, and reflections bring me to the travel advice I have.&nbsp; &nbsp;  1) Purse that was perfect was a kmart $14.99 american tourister black bag with adjustable straps and waterproof, zippered  2) Be sure to stop by a  grocery store  near your hotel to get things you may need... things I needed or purchased:  a)&nbsp; coffee single bags (because I got tired of Nescafe that everyone seems to love in SE Asia)  b)&nbsp; fresh fruit like bananas (When Kevin wants Mcdonalds, I still can have real food)  c)&nbsp; interesting little snacks and instant cup of noodles for the hotel room.  d)&nbsp; bottled water, sodas or whatever you drink......don't pay the price in your hotel room charges.  3) Pack nutrition bars - a must to satisfy in between times  4)&nbsp; don't bother with a raincoat, an umbrella is fine.&nbsp; In singapore, you can purchase one or hotel provides.  5)&nbsp; Jeans feel too hot.&nbsp; Poly blend pants were fine for me with a loose top.&nbsp;  6)&nbsp; Shorts are not as welcome as in the US, and they make your legs a mosquito magnet  7) sunscreen and deet bug spray a must  8) recommend lever 2000 antibacterial soap bar - pack in your suitcase, leave what you dont use  9)&nbsp; Clothes,.....if you are thin and in Manila.....pack old clothes or few and just buy some there as prices are great.&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore sizes run small.&nbsp; Asians are thin (or healthy) unlike us big Americans.  10)&nbsp; Film for camera .....&nbsp; humm.&nbsp; Well the Singapore carryon exray said their x-ray was film safe.....when in the U.S. connecting flights, be sure to hand your film to the security person and they will check it and it won't have to go through x-ray.  11)&nbsp; Should have taken my nice digital camera.  12)&nbsp; Manila was not as scary as what I read on the internet.  13) Singapore was not as scary (with their fines and canings) as I read on the internet....  14) Don't let anyone as much as touch your baggage except yourself or your hotel person, or airport security personel.  15)&nbsp; The bathrooms in Singapore were the most frightening thing I saw.&nbsp; Stick to the hotel restrooms and all is well.&nbsp; I did not use Manila restrooms, except at fancy places, golf clubs, etc.  16)&nbsp;Be sure to pack handiwipes or antibacterial wipes and tissue packets as restrooms have no&nbsp;toilet paper.&nbsp; Also, restrooms do not have hot water&nbsp;to wash hands (except hotel of course or nice places).   &nbsp; u
