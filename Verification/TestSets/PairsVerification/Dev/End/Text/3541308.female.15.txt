Foster is crying out loud for help. Then, Dani run fast where she had heard some shouting for help, there she saw Court’s mother crying and holding Court’s lifeless body. Then, Dani was so afraid to what she had seen and she run more faster, calling for help. She runs faster as if she didn’t know where to go. As she arrived to their house she calls for her father to help Court in his serious condition and her father rushed to help him. They had arrived in the hospital but Court died on the spot. When Dani knew that Court is already dead, she started to cry and mourn. Suddenly, Maureen also knew it. It is more painful for Maureen because she is carrying Court’s baby. The parents knew that she is pregnant and they felt terribly sorry for her. There are nights that Dani and Maureen didn’t talk because of the tragedy and the conflict between the three of them. But Mrs. Trant talked to her younger daughter about the problem. She explained and gave advices to Dani. Then the following day, Dani is about to talk to Maureen but Maureen is not home. She found her in the cemetery and there she saw her sister mourning in front of Court’s tomb. Then she realized that she is not the only one who is in sorrow but additional sorrow for her sister because she will always Court because she has his baby. The both of them became friends again and start life all over again. It was night time and it was full moon then. They agreed to theirselves that Court will still remain in their hearts and they will remember him when they look upon the moon. Its like until there is the moon in the dark night sky, Court is still with them.            CONCLUSION: 	 I therefore conclude that the plotline is very simple and in many ways predictable. But the real art is how the story is told from beginning to end. You end up caring about all the characters and how your sympathy moves from one to another.  EVALUATION: 	 I will never tire of reading it because this isn't just a story about teenage romance, it's a story about idealism, about how we idealize what and who we love, and a story about the meaning of life. Yes, the Meaning of Life, which is a topic of teenagers discuss a good deal as their insides churn with hope and doubt, and which adults discuss less and less, the more they could benefit from it.
Time to Say Goodbye   Time pass by Precious moments too Could've been Many questions  It wasn't ever meant to be Lovers we were never  However A lesson learned Forever treasured Always there  Thank you for your existence It is enough Goodbye   by jowelduke
