Hey ladies!  I just wanted to post a link to a website that contains a lot of discussion on "The L Word".  This should give everyone some background information on the show, its plot and the characters.  Here is the link: www.afterellen.com/TV/thelword/firstseason/html  If it doesn't allow you to click on it you should be able to copy and paste the url.  See everyone on Tuesday!  Apryl

Hi guys,  Sorry for the short notice, but I got quite a good idea for this week.  Let's meet and do a little Tarot, palm reading, ouija and intuition card session!  April said we can do it at her place... (Thanks April) she will send the indications to get there soon.  So bring all the spiritual stuff you have home... I will try to bring a few candles and tea so we can create a relaxing ambiance... You are welcome to bring anything you would like!  See you tomorrow!  Cynthia
Salut à toutes! Hello!  This tuesday, i would like to talk about sports. Not like the guys tho, unless you want to. Personally, I like to keep my body busy with loads of activities (walk, blade, cycle, run, swim, softball, yoga, etc..) Keeps it and my brain happy. i thought it would be cool to talk about how we all compose with the daily realitiy of physical activity, what makes us feel good and why.   Since we`re talking about that and since I LOVE gelato, what do you say we all get some ice cream, have a chat while we`re there and then decide if we want to just go for a walk after that or if it`s crappy, we`ll relocate to an indoor location, maybe the Manx or the Pump.  So we`ll meet up at PURE GELATO on Elgin Street. I`ll have my cell if need be: 371-6352 @ 7:30 for ice cream, and probably move out of there by about 8:15 @ the latest.  See you then! Don`t wear lipschtick, we're licking some ice cream.....   A
