says: hahaha  I think the point is, it isn't supposed to be so straightforward...  I guess I've gotten a bit too close to Ben :$ I'm not sure what to do. I mean, we have alot in common which is great, but I couldn't, I seriously have given up with the whole guy thing. He's sweet, nice, great, whatnot, but I just don't feel as romantically inclined, to anyone, as I was a week ago.   I also saw Sofi today, and she took me to her place. I saw her dogs, and I mean, these dogs are crazy. They full on jump of top of you (these are labs) and try and sit on you. The younger of the two is completely unco-ordinated, her legs are everywhere, she was a starfish :S
Fuck it all.  I have had it with dad's threats.  If he hits me ever, ever again. If he lays a hand on me, I am taking out an AVO. I am going to the police and I will get a restraining order. I don't care anymore. He's threatening to kick me out unless I "pay my own way". WELL FUCK THAT. If you were such a fucking great parent you'd respect me and give me a chance to GET HELP before making threats.  I so don't care. If I end up living in some foster home, under some stranger's care, with nothing but the clothes I wear, I don't care. As long as I know that he feels like a failure, because he is one, and god do we all know it.  Let me explain tonight:  He comes home from dropping off my perfect sister, and asks to "speak with me". I know what's coming. This kind of thing always happens. Anyway. Is as follows  "You're not going to school anymore. You're going to have to pay for everything now. You will have to pay for internet access, for everything." So I walk into my room. He tells my mum that he had a talk to me about my etiquette on the phone (earlier today I took a call from him and wasn't very polite - basically I was in a rush). BULLSHIT HE DID. I pipe up from my room. He comes in. Oh great, here we go Basically a lecture follows, I tell him to please leave  - I actually said please. He stares at me and opens his mouth but before he can let out a word, I cut him off "Goodnight". He pretty much lunges towards me with his hand raised, I practically have to beg not to get slapped/knocked around. Fortunately I was able to get him to back down.  And he has the nerve to wonder why I don't tell him anything, why I rarely talk to him and the likes.  It's because he doesn't understand anything.  So here I am praying for my stanley knife, but knowing I can't get at it because Naoko is in my room.  I hope I fucking choke on my tears.  I so wish I was d
