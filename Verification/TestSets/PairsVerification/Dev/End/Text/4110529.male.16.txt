cigarettes is worth more than an hour of work, you might want to think twice about asking, unless you can definitely assure him of a purchased-but-absent compensation cigarette.  Don't be that guy dude, just don't.  Wonder Boy Wonder Boy is the name I give to customer who has been something of a regular to the store recently.  Today he was wearing aviators, as per usual, and a head-to-toe Abercrombie and Fitch jumpsuit.  He first came in with his mother and they bought hamburger buns and some type of vegetable.  His manner and look screamed camp to me, but my gay-dar is so jammed in this day and age (curse you to hell, Details magazine).  I had him pegged for a fairy until he came into the store later, this time (the first time ever) sans sunglasses, accompanied by a not-to-bad-looking girl.  This new development in the vast anthropological pool from which all cashiers sample in their day-to-day is truly fascinating.  Keep aware of further updates.  A Fellow Employee vs. Jerkface from Out of Town. A bagger at the store is mentally handicapped, but in a minor way.  She is very sweet to all the kids who come through the store, usually asking them how school was during June and, as the summer progresses, asking them how camp was.  Some woman came in today with her daughter who looked to be between nine and eleven years old, to who my accomplice in check-out posed "How was day camp today?"  The girl replied that she does not go to camp, a totally legitimate response, but her mother appended "What camp?"  When my co-worker replied "The day camp at the park; in town," the girls mother replied "Oh, she doesn't go to camp here; we're from California.  Did you think that you recognized her."  Now, the posing of the question "How was camp today" does not need to be predicated on fellowship or even acquaintance with the object of the question.  My gregarious bagger was simply making the assumed leap to the assumption that the girl went to camp.  The supercilious tone that the customer took was so very unnecessary and hostile even.
I would first like to apologize for the address of this blog.  I do not condone perversions of the English language, and do not subscribe to “hax0r” culture, nor do I suffer well its lexicon that consists entirely of contrived transliterations of the Latin alphabet.  However, the names "Perko" and "Perki," long my nicknames --albeit among two seperate peer groups-- were already taken by, respectively, a procrastinator and someone who hasn't posted since he got his up.  Dope.  Anyway, I hope that this will be a productive and worthwhile use of the space on Blogger's servers, and not some kind of homage to inane and crass humor of the type that pervades profiles, blogs, and firstclass resumes.  Anyway, I am tired as all hell after mon Tour de Ouestchester this afternoon, and have yet to master self governance in using the ill wifi setup which I set up recently in my h
