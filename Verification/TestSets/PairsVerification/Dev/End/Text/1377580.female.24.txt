for me!
Supposedly it's independence day.  All I care about is that I get a day off work tomorrow.  Spent the day "celebrating freedom" by napping and then cooking up some food on the bbq.  I'll be making my bookings for my trip to the UK and Bahrain soon.     Anyway.. here's an excerpt from my Mum's latest email.  Needless to say, I'm seething with jealousy. I mean, it's not like she deserves it or anything. ;)    I spent one night in Rome.  Looked at the  urlLink Colosseum  and  urlLink Palatine Hill  then on to  urlLink Polignano a Mare .  What a find for Julie and Pete.  If you want a beach holiday in Italy where the sea breeze gives pleasant evenings and there are no foreign tourists, let me know as this will be rented out to tourists every summer Julie and co are not using it themselves.  It was even better than I expected, with a view over the Adriatic (could see the ferries from Greece passing) from their roof and two night concerts in the piazza for which we had ringside seats, sipping our pina coladas on the balcony. After 5 nights I took the train to  urlLink Perugia  and have the most fantastic accom for E12 a night in a spacious hostel right in the heart of the city.  From both my room and the big hostel balcony are wonderful views over the city and the Umbrian landscape.  I have explored Perugia on foot (architecturally quite unlike any other city I,ve seen, with towering brick walls, often curved) and also seen  urlLink Assisi , including  urlLink St Francis,s tomb  and  urlLink Todi ,a hiitop town (as are all Roman towns it seems) with more narrow streets and winding alleys.  Tomorrow on to  urlLink Siena .
Especially if someone with as little "l33t" skills as I have can catch one. heh.   The following email is edited for length.

This requires a private arrangement. You will receive these funds under legal claims, all legal documents will be carefully worked out to ensure a risky free transfer. I will give you all the  details.  Please reply on: josephgreen@coolgoose.com  The funds in question are quite large. I will expect a straight answer from you. Yes or no. If yes, then lets work out the modalities.  Thanks, Joseph G
