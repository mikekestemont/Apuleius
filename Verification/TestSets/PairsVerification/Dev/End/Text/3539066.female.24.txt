When the time comes to pay for the meal, they magically present the bill to the waiter while everyone else protests. People have also been known to sneak away and take the bill straight to the cash register to pay for it while everyone else is occupied with conversation. That method is probably the funniest one.   When I was little, I thought it was the most embarrassing thing when my parents and the other people got into the whole bill "fight". Sometimes it would last for 10 minutes!! I'm not kidding either. After a while, it started to become amusing. I think the waiters enjoy it too.
I had one and a half glasses of beer...probably the most beer I've ever had! It got grosser the more I drank. But that's all I needed to get REALLY RED. Fortunately I didn't feel like passing out...although, I began feeling woozy when I went to the washroom -- so I got out of there quickly. Or at least I tried to! The lady inside the washroom turned on the tap when I came out of the stall, then she gave me soap, AND she gave me paper towel! The whole time I'm thinking, she better stop giving me stuff, I'm not going to tip her! Those washroom people are annoying.  Here's some pics:   urlLink    urlLink
Awww...no mo-gee-toes.... we'll make them next time! Now we have a bottle of creme de cassis! We'll make some cocktails. The sangria was good. :)
I had an annoying time this morning when I tried to look up the recipe for mojitos. And the reason is because I spelled it as "mohitos"! I'm so dumb. So I finally got the recipe but then my sister and I began debating about whether or not we should make mojitos or sangria tomorrow. It was like,   "Mojitos?"  "Yeah."  "Wait, no, sangria." "Ok." "But we have that bottle of rum from Helen!" "Ok fine, mojitos."  Later: "No, but wouldn't it be better if we made a pitcher of something rather than individual servings?" "Ok, sangria then." "Ok, I know! We make sangria then when that runs out we can make mojitos!" "Ok, fine. Stop talking about it."  And this whole time I kept on spelling mojitos with an "h". Mo-gee-toes. Mo-hee-toes.
Apparently no one reads my blog anymore except Garvey and my sister. Actually I don't even know if Garvey has time since he's in Oakville trying to do textures in Photoshop with a Wacom tablet that's not fully functioning.   The good thing is...my bday is coming up!! woohoo!    Bad thing:  colour balancing in Photoshop is so annoying!  Good thing:  I applied to a job today!  Bad thing:  Woolfitt is going away for 1 1/2 months so I have no work to do!  Good thing:  I got paid by Woolfitt today. Yeah $15/h!  Bad thing:  I'm still at Walmart. :(  Good thing:  I tricked the TTC and I stopped over and bought something at Loomis and then went on the streetcar with the same transfer! hehe  ok that's it. I have no more. Well, I'm t
