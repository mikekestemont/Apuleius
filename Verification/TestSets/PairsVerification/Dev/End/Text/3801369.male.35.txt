this over and over again (gazillions of times), it should be possible to produce very capable software, without any "conscious" design?  Where's the flaw in my thinking?  Sure, it will be difficult to define "better" and "worse" mutants, but that doesn't sound insurmountable.  Any ideas?
Anyone got a good solution on how to archive one's personal collection of digital photo's?   What I'm looking for is something really quick and easy to use, but which makes it fairly simple to find a photo, or group of photo's at a later date, even if my collection totals say tens of thousands of images over time.   urlLink WinAmp  does a great job of this for my music (together with a tag editor like  urlLink  Tag and Rename , but I'm looking for an equivalent for my photos.    I recently stumbled upon  urlLink Adobe's   urlLink Photoshop Album  which seems to do a pretty nifty job given my basic requirements.  What I really liked was the ability to create arbitrary tags (which can be structured into hierarchies if so desired).  So for example I can create a tag hierarchy like:  - people - - family - - - dad - - - mum - - friends - - - bald bob - - - horny henrietta - places - - home - - beach house - - ski hut - events - - christmas - - - 2003 - - - 2004  etc (sorry - got a bit carried away! :-0) ... and then I can attach any combination of these tags to any of my pictures.  Of course I can add captions too. And then by simply twiddling a few checkboxes (horny henrietta check, ski hut check ;-) I can filter through my thousands of images and find the one's I'm looking for.  Once I've found the images I can play a slide show, burn a DVD, make a video etc.  Can anyone offer any advice on better solutions?  One concern I have is that I don't want to tie myself into any particular software for now and evermore.  Adobe Photoshop Album is great but stores all the info in some proprietary database, which is presumably not readable by anything other than their software.  I'd prefer to go with an open standard (equivalent to ID3 tags for MP3 files), which are supported by almost all software.  Is there such a standard?  Can anyone recommend any good software (preferably free) which supports this format?
