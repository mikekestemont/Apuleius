velvetygolden tones anyway, so one just ends up sounding small.  What's the point of stream-of-consciousness when your stream isn't anything to brag about? To smother yourself in morning glory and petulias.
Yesterday, my mom walked into my room to wake me up. She saw my journal lying indiscreetly by my bed, unwisely left open there by yours truly. Still half-asleep, I saw her pick it up [Later she said she just wanted to see what I was writing every day before bed and had no intention of actually reading it] and immediately panicked. Keep in mind that I wasn't fully awake. I kicked it out of her hands. Yes, kicked. Although [good thing, too], I only managed to kick the journal. Regardless, it tumbled out of her hands onto the ground. My mom gave me a weird look, put it back, and when I made sure she wouldn't pick it up again, I fell back asleep.  I'm rather touchy about people reading that thing. Although the funny thing is, I don't write anything really "private" in it, per se. It's full of observations and feelings instead of "real life" [ie "OMG Joe is SOOOOOOOooo hot but he won't ask me out!!!! And I went to the park to chill with my homies and I had an ice cream that fell and ruined my shirt! >=O"]. I suppose you can call it a piece of soul.  I want to write down everything I feel right now. I'm young. I can still see things that adults take for granted, because they're no longer curious. Life is already routine for them. It's still changing for us, and I want to preserve the freshness of everything. I see the world through a glass shaped by my experiences, you see the world as something shaped by yours. Naivete? I want to remember how it feels, and I am full of it right now. And in the teenage years we're more curious than ever.  Sometimes I want to be a boy. Yesterday I wanted to be a boy, except the feeling was a passing thing that I can't remember fully right now. But boys seem to be less absorbed with shallow problems. They seem to live more interesting lives than  I  do, at least. I can't speak for the entire half of the population.  Of course, maybe I'm percieving things wrongly. Probably am, in fact. After all, it can't be  that  wonderful to be horny 24/7, can it? [kidding, peoples]  The world is my shrimp and I will conquer all!
Alex is now part of the Blogger family [whatever the family may be]! Go him.  Anyway, it's about time I made a proper post for once. I'll do it next time =)
