take to finish it. There's no way I'd be able to do it before November. I wanted it to fit into Halo's story. If Halo 2 changes up that story from what we know, my fiction will become absolutely useless. So I'll probably type up my storyboards sometime. Maybe in my next blog.  So far the only movie I've seen this summer is Spiderman 2. Sure, it was a great movie, but I've missed out on a lot. Ah, well, that's what usually happens to me. I slack off too much and lose whatever I wanted to do. Meh.  I've also been trying out so strategy RPGs online, namely Dark Throne and Kings of Chaos. I haven't really been paying much attention to either. Dark Throne just doesn't grab my attention too much, and KoC is way too slow-paced. There's also another game called Kingdom of Loathing, and I've been spending a lot of time with that. I'm currently a level 4 Disco Bandit. A Jiggy Grifter. Heh heh, the game is funny. What other game has you fighting possessed cans of asparagus and a troll who barbeques nipples?  I got a surround sound thing for my TV downstairs, so I've been reliving some old games. Halo is brilliant with the bass turned up. Brr-ap Brr-ap.  Is there honestly anything I can do to jumpstart the rest of my summer? I've been neglecting friends. I've been ignoring a lot of people. I don't clean my room. I haven't all summer. Is there something wrong with that?  Maybe I just don't live well without something to do. I don't like that fact, but even Joe saw how pathetic I am right now. He came over bearing gifts of wheat and barley (well, corn and melon, actually), and stood witness to my obsession with this little thing I call "my computer".  I always figured I'd be able to do what I want when I wanted to. I must've assumed wrong. Right now I do absolutely nothing. I'm either sleeping, working, or typing. My eyes hurt, I'm always tired, and at work I'm miserable. Ugh.  The other dishwasher from work quit, and guess who gets to replace him. Yeah, me! How lucky! Now I get to work every day!  We might go to Canada again before the summer's over, but to be honest, I really don't want to. What I want is to go to the beach or something and just hang out with some friends. That I may or may not have.  I've never been a very socially-inclined person. I don't know why. Am I boring? Am I shy? Am I just plain strange? Why is it that I can't just be like everyone else? While all the rest of the world is trying to be different, I'm trying to figure out how to be the same.  School starts on the 26th. Ilovebees ends (?) on the 24th. That might give me a good two days of fun, assuming a Halo 2 demo is released.  Yeah, I'm boring. That's got to be i
