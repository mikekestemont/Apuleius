what the directors of this film were trying to say, other than drive real careful and if you hit an escaped cheetah you might get a chance to watch it turn back into a cheetah slash bird thing.  Jake loved the film, but I guess when your dying you love pretty much everything you look at.  As for me, I really wished they hadn't made this movie. On a scale of 1 to 10, I have to give Dodgeball a two.
Greetings fellow movie lovers.  Todays review:  Directed by Michael Moore, whose weight of at least 350lbs has grown to be a favorite of panty-waste world-wide since the 2003 Academy Awards, Fahrenheit 9/11, like Moore's Bowling For Columbine and Roger & Me, promises to give those idiots who can't do anything but complain about how much their lives suck, this movie gives them their Election 2004 marching orders.  Fahrenheit 9/11's Cannes Film Festival debut marked the first time a propganda piece has been included among the festival's main competition.  I saw this movie today and let me tell you it should have been called "Fahrenheit Borefest"  When the film first starts everyone there who were so excited to see what all the talk was about were quickly puzzled.  This movie opens with Michael Moore eating a hot dog, at least 1 minute of him putting ketchup and onions all over the dog.  Then he just stares at it for 10 F-ing minutes while the sounds of bag-pipes play some weird song I've never heard.  All of a sudden the song stops and he slowly raises his head and he sings David Bowie's Let's Dance.  That kind of lightened the mood and put a smile on the faces around, and damn, that guy can sing!  After the song the shot cuts to the outside of a car wash and we see Moore pouring gasoline all over a small dog and setting it on fire, then by movie magic the dog, still on fire, talks and makes his plea, "Please vote for John Kerry, he is a good man and he love balloons."  The dog dies right after that and the words, "Vote Bush Out.  He hates Jake.  And so does children.  Die Jake!"  The movie ended and then at that moment it was all clear why everyone loves this film.  Everyone hates Bush and Jake. But for me, I like Jake, he's funny and makes so good music.  I also like Bush so I have to say this is a terrible film.  A moive that preaches such hate can't be good. When the movie was over I noticed that a young girl was crying quietly and saying, "I love Jake, and now I hate Michael Moore!"  I give this turkey one star.  Save your money and go buy a book, something with a lot of action, because everyone needs a little action in their lives.  So good bye for now, and keep keeping those dreams real, alright! -The Cobra has spoken.
