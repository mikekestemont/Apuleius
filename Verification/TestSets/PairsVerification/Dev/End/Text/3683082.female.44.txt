day being wednesday, and start a new job on Monday. Same type of work just a different company with better benefits and little less stress factor involved.  Hooray for me!!!!  I do home health care with mentally and physically handicapped adults. DO I HAVE LIKE CAREGIVER WRITTEN ALL OVER ME OR WHAT PRAY TELL!!!!!!       I am 44yrs old, blonde, busty, and very opinionated.  For the most part I say what's on my mind and honesty plays a big role in my life.  I don't lie to people and hate it when I am lied to.  Friendships are special to me as I have alot of acquaintances, but I am very picky about close friends.  Letting people into the real me is quite disarming to me so I am very careful about choosing friends.  As of right now you might say that I am on the Outside looking in as far as the friend department goes.  Not sure what I mean by that?  Well let me try to explain, My best friend up and moved out of state, which in turn left me totally lost.  When I was happy, sad, mad, or whatever she was the one I called on and could always count on.  Well now that she has moved she has a new life, new home, new friends, don't get me wrong I know she still cares about me, but she has so much going on in her life that I hate to burden her with my crap.  Then there are two others here and for the last 5 years we talked and hung out all the time, well the two of them had a oh shall we say parting of the ways which left me kind of in the middle. now I didn't take sides and remained true to both of them, I called and stop by to check on them and see if all was ok, well a couple of months ago I noticed something, it was all one sided, my side, I seemed to be the only one who made an effort.  So I stopped calling, stopped it all and as I thought, Nothing at all, no calls, nothing. So needless to say here I am on the outside looking in as far as friendship department goes.  It's lonely at times but at least I know where I stand.       Married??? Now that is a loaded question.  yes the last time I checked there was a man still in the recliner watching TV and occassionally he comes through the house and grunts something at me.  So yes, I am married.  woohoo for me!! I think we have lost each other along the way as so many people do with children, jobs, life, ect....and we are no acceptions.  I am not going to get on this blog to blow smoke up you ass about how perfect my life or marriage for that matter is.  It's not, that is why it is called life and not fantasy.         I will close for now and maybe share some more with you l
