and ended up having an early night, because I felt completely knackered - Jo was working at college, and Mum looked afterthe kids until about 7:30.  So it was just a case of picking them up putting them to bed, sorting a few things out for today and then bed!!  Today it was just a case of picking up a few lintels and waiting for Pat the groundworker to come.  He is going to prepare the drains today and tomorrow, with a view to laying the pad on Tuesday - (already busy on Monday).  So I think it's a few beers to wind down tonight and then get on with tidying the mess that has been created over the last few days over the weekend - still the weather looks like it's going to be good. Hurrah!
Well today is going  to pot - Jewsons have decided not to deliver the required engineering bricks and  I have a brickie and his mate sitting idle at the moment - and the next chance  he has to come and do the work is next week, which of course is all extra  cost.&nbsp; This means that the groundworkers can't lay the pad  either..........     &nbsp;
Well today the trench blocks and external skin of engineering bricks to damp proof course have been started.  One of Dads mates, Shaun, is doing the work and by my inexperienced eyes he seems a quick worker.  The whole of the front and garage side of the house are complete now, and he reckons he should be able to finish tomorrow.  The fly in the ointment though is that Jewsons still haven't delivered all of the remainder of the trench blocks, nor the final pallet of engineering bricks.  Shaun has enough to be going on with, but it looks like we'll be skin of our teeth with the delivery.  Building inspectors are a curious entity though.  Ours insisted on lintels everywhere, but then was that bothered about seeing the work done today.  Just means I have to fly around getting ad-hoc materials - the joys of "self-build", well "self project manage"!!

Yes I mean the 20th century - this should have been the norm in the late 90's never mind in 2004.  Still just means that they only have to get the decor of hospitals out of the 60's now.....
