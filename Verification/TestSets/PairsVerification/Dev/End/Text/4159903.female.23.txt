city will know how to correctly pronounce Willamette University's illustrious name. It was the "First University in the West" after all....  On another note, props to Mike, Wagner, and myself for being so awesome that we went to Georgetown club last night (a Sunday) at 11:00 pm. Wow, pretty impressive right? The club we went to was having a Prince vs. Michael Jackson vs. Rick James dance party. I wish you guys could have seen some the regulars--these people were cool, man.  Let's end with a moment of silence for Rick James. .............  Thank you.
At what point of inactivity do we actually begin getting dumber?  I started thinking about this very question last year (the first year out of college) when, through a combination of increased alcohol consumption (who would have thought?) and decreased reading of Plato, I suspected that I was slowly losing IQ points.  In order to fully and scientifically test this very issue, I have decided to examine things learned only last night and D and J's BBQ.  Yes, not all knowledge can be learned in books.  Take that GW students.  (Also, if you are a GW student: for goodness sake, put on a real skirt.)  Taking a page out of Eastoffice blog's book, I have compiled a list of the  Top Five Things Learned at a BBQ/Party in Adams Morgan .  Without further ado:  5.  How to shotgun a beer.  Although this is an important life skill, I have chose to make it number five simply because you should already know how to do this.  I mean really, D.  4.  If you ever meet a rat in D and J's alley do not stop for conversation.  He will be large enough to take off your entire forearm with one ratty bite.  Instead, point to something, (say, a party-goer throwing a beer can off the balcony, hitting the car below) say "whoa!" and run swiftly back to 18th.  3.  Stop eating chicken when you first suspect it may not be completely cooked.  Although OOB persisted in chicken eating a little longer than was wise, please stop when you see that it is pink.  Stick to the dip, OOB.  2.  Do not turn down Beezy's music.  She downloaded those songs for a reason.  1.  And finally, always remember to use the bathroom before leaving for a bar.  The known danger is almost always better than the unknown.  See, now didn't we all learn something?
So here I am chillin' with the OOB....For those of you who don't know this dude. Well. Lemme tell you he is a TREAT. In fact, you can check out  urlLink his blog  that is written in conjunction with his officemates (including my roomie, Beezy) as they sit, stagnant, at their office and my former work place. We made some 7-layer dip and are prepping for an evening of BBQing and drinking oot and aboot. We are also listening to LL Cool J's "Headsprung." This is a fantastic song for those of you who haven't been introduced to the dynamic vocal stylings of this lyrical g
