can do now is to stick to it. And not let myself down. I feel like saying something.. "I give up"
have you ever wondered if you have hated anybody in this world? Frankly, I have. But, is it right of me to hate people? To hate people whom I once used to call friends? I really have no idea. The feeling of hatred just seems to come to me and refuses to bug off. Why is this so? I have no idea and I do not know how to solve it. Hating takes up time, makes me sad, makes me unhappy. It's definitely not a good feeling. But, can someone please help me remove the hatred in me? I do not want to hate them at all. But people change. How do you prevent someone from changing? I know, maybe to others, they must have feel that I have changed. However, just how true is this? I have no idea. I really do not wish to hate them at all. They were once after all, my so called friends.
Today is the day where i cried the most. I am sad. I am depressed. I am upset. I am unhappy. I feel like crying, and I did. I just made a most touching speech of my life. But i still failed terribly. I didnt keep him back and it's gone. Everything seems different. Everything seems funny. What would it be like without him? Will my life still be as perfect without a pillar? Will I be able to survive well? He was right in something. Our character clashes. We shouldn't have got together in the first place at all. We are better off being friends, i guess. Whenever we get together, we quarrel. We just seem to have no peace. But I never regretted it. I cherished every moment we had together, up till now. I know, it's almost 2 years but.. we have to part at this time. I feel like crying again. I cried so much, so much for you. No matter how much I tell myself, be brave, don't cry, I have always failed. I failed in so many things and this time, I failed so terribly that I tremble at the thought of.. Surviving without you.
I feel so sad. So hurt. You can never imagine how hurt I am. It just seems like my heart has broken into a thousand million pieces. It hurts to see the people around you change. It really hurts. From your close friends, to the person closest to you. Do you know how much it hurts to me? I treated you so well but i deserved all this? My heart hurts.. It really does..
