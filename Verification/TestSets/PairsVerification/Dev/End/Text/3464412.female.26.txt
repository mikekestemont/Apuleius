This was taken when we were driving through Illinois. The climate was very unpredicatable; it was rainy and sunny. This picture represents the beautiful clouds which were getting diffused to trickle down as rain. 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink 5a98 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink swapna bolleboina .
