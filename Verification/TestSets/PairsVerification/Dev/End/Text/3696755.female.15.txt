things will turn out just fine, i know it. Things are super. :-)
Ok this is all very confussing and im sure all of this wont make any sence but i have all this stuff in my head and it needs to go somewhere. There all this emotions and questions that i need to get out there. Ok thigns between #3 and i are good. were hangin out a lot, talkin on the phone and stuff like that. We both really like eachother, we tell eachother all the time. But were not going out. And really im not 100% sure why, like hes told me kinda but i idnt really get it. I mean what are you waiting for, things are perfect, they couldnt get better, there cant be a better time? I dunno. And im sure your thinking, hes playin you. But i no hes not. I no it. Ive been with enough guys who have tried to pull that shit over on me and i can tell. But the things he says to me, and how he says them, i can tell. And hes not that kinda person. And when we kiss (witch is all weve done witch is another way i no hes not playin me) its different than anything else. Like the way he holds me so incredably close and the way that when were walking and he holds my hand so tight like he doesnt want to let go. And threw all these thigns, were not goin out. I dont undersatnd it. I dunno maybe im missing something. Like i dunno, we were talking the other night and my dad kept buggin me to ask him if he was my bf. So finally i was like fuck it and i asked him and he said "well the reasion i havnt done anything yet is becasue i wanna wait a little like till school starts and see what happeends"??? and so i was like ok. thats cool. Then i get off the phone and me texts me about how he "really really likes me but wants to get to no me better before anything serious happeneds"?And im like ok thats fine. And it is, i have no problem. I just dont understand why. We were together last night and after he left i texted him that "being with him feels more right than anything else", and he said, "i cant find the words to describe how i feel". What does that maen, help me out casue for the life of me it just confussed me. So all day all i can think of is how confussd i am, and honestly it boggles my mind. Like i dont even no. and if anyone, well whoever reads this, can help me out in anyway, the littlest piece of advice would help, please let me no. Post a comment, e-mail me, call me, cause im completly lost. its frusterating, to like someone like this, know that they feel the same, and to have them, but at the same time u d
