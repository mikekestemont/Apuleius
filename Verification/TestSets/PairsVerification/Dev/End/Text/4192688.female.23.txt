Ozzfest. You get: to give away "Shared Pleasure" condoms to guys who paid money to come see the original Black Sabbath and Judas Priest reuinion, to wear a short black skirt around a population of the dirtiest (physical and otherwise) men all in one place at the same time, to endure hours worth of the same unoriginal pick up line, and as many free condoms as you can fit in ... your skin-tight Trojan "Hottie" tank top. Sigh.    I really like the "Praise the Whore" shirt.       Several times I have mentioned payment for these types of promotions. And I admit, it isn't bad considering all the bullshit you can get away with on these tours. But with most things, there is a catch. When you sign your contract to do a promotion, you're signing an agreement that it can take anywhere from 30-45 days to receive payment for that event. Well, if you get payment within 45 days, consider yourself lucky. There are promotions that I worked back in June for which I still have not received payment. I think they are hoping that you are unorganized and unable to keep records of your work history. Some companies are very good about getting payment to you when their pay period is over and sometimes they get your check to you right away. Good companies to work for are Kandu Marketing, Take Out Marketing, and Momentum. Companies that you should NOT deal with if you ever want to get paid:        Encore Nationwide     DIZON Modeling Agency     National Talent Resource (NTR)        That is my official shit list as of right now. Pass it on. If, for some reason, you are interested in working these kinds of jobs, I can hook you up. A forwarning, though, once you get on those mailing lists it is like being in a gang - a lot harder to get out than to get in. Good luck.
urlLink    Devil Dog!  Check out Riley's website  urlLink here .  We put Riley on  urlLink Dogster  last night and we really do believe that he is the cutest Siberian Husky on the site.  There are a couple other huskies that we would let him play with but for the most part he really is the cutest.  He is officially listed as  Riley "Poopypants" Hanaway .  This morning, however, I received an invitation from a toy poodle that wants Riley to be in his doggie playgroup.  I mean, I am sure that the toy poodle means well, but Riley would fancy using it as a chew toy if they were in a  real  playgroup.  He also got an invitation from a Yorkshire Terrier.  Once again, I have seen Riley eat birds that were larger than Yorkshire Terriers.  Do we really want him playing with those dogs?  I was kind of hoping to have all Siberian Huskies on his Dogster profile in hopes of building a strong, good-looking dog sled team later on when he gets more mature and stops eating fabric and random outside hairballs.    Am I being too picky? ; urlLink
