afraid of  you...of the things you could do to us... I wished you weren't so  irritatingly perfect and disgustingly undersatnding. I wished he didn't  loved you at all. But you are irritatingly perfect and disgustingly  understanding and he loved you. I said to myself the first time I sent you  an email..."You are one hell of a sick bitch!" (i'm refering to myself here)  But I did it anyway...I wanted to get to know you to lessen my doubts and  fears and my guilt. At first it was simply because I wanted to find out if  he made the right decision...if I was better than you. Well you know what i  am not better than you and you are not better than me either. We are just  two different woman who happens to love the same man. i hated Joel when he  told me that he told you that we sort of look a like...(not in a bad way, i  just hate to be compared and I am not comfortable unless I am distinct). I  am obsessed about you. Just as those loser friends ( sorry!) of yours are  obsessed about me. For us to really move on... we should forgive each other  and stop hurting each other anymore.it is not easy to let go but we are left  with no other options but to do so.the past is not for living in (actually  that line is more for me) i want peace in our relationship and I know you  want it in your life as well. Things happen for a reason...I haven't been  really happy before Joel came...I am happy but superficial happy... being  able to do something that I am so passionate about, meeting new and  interesting people, making all that money, going out evry night (who cares  if it's school night!)...I mean I have a full but empty life (if you know  what I'm talking about) Maybe I just need him more than you do and maybe I  am the one he needs as well. He brought direction to my life...and I brought  direction to his. He taught me that life is not one big glamourous show...  Remember when we both found out that he gave us the same bracelet for  christmas...it nearly blew my head off. I wanted to wring his neck because  that bracelet meant a lot to me...but you see it doesn't make it less  special because he gave the same thing to you... I know that now. I wish you  all the happiness in this world and I sincerely hope that you'll find the  one for you. Or maybe he'll find you? Take care my friend.  sometimes there is no plan... we may have all that anecdotes and creeds to  live by but all we really have to do is breathe everyday and see what  happens...   always, margo  * i will be silently praying for your happiness. Don't worry I will take  care of him and his family. I don't know if you have seen this but I also  attached our fave pic t
