I hate the terrain, it was going high, then low, then high again. So, occasionally we saw a few first aid guys or house guys around a corner, waving the house flag. Then I would just shout "Buckley rox!!!" and continue running. Well, I prefer something to take me off my mind a bit. However, after about 800m, Gabriel started slowing down. So it was Yoshio and me now, with 30 or so more ppl at our front.  The second part was pavement and more pavement.Well, I kept looking down at the drain, then I did a dumb thing: I started getting bored of running and doing nothing, so I counted the no. of drains we had past. When I lost count, I counted the no. of bus stops we past (6 approx). The demoralising thing is the cars on the road. They hit 60-80 km/h so u would start to feel that u are really damn slow when next to the car. Well, humans are humans, and cars are cars, I have nothing to say.  So, when exactly did I lose Yoshio-san??? The thing is, I didn't. He ran with me the ENTIRE way!!! He was right next beside me for the full 4.8km! Omg, he's fast! I think he could be faster than me as he may think that it is best to follow a familiar face around than to run alone in a foreign land. Cool. Where our top class runner Nelson Chua was busy doing Yeoman service (hey! shouldn't a runner be running and not doing service??? I am growing jealous of him being able to slack) and Nelson is a true blue Buckleyian, Rafflesian and Singaporean, Yoshio-san was running with me, and he's neither a Buckleyian nor a Rafflesian, not even a Singaporean. Nelson should be ashamed.  So anyway, I came in the 31st of approx. 450 students in the sec 2 batch. And yay, top fifty get points for their house and get badges. So Yoshio got a badge whereby Nelson didn't! Who called him not to run???  Btw, we came in around 20+ mins. Aaron came in around 45 mins. LOL.
Aw..man  As I expected, we were supposed to swim an *easy* 30 continuous laps of *simple* butterfly stroke.  It took me *only* about an hour.  *For all those Merchant of Venice readers, here's a key question: What's Mark's tone and attitude as he says these sentences???  Swimming really sux.  And guess what?? 3 hours ago, someone died of heart attack in the same pool 3 hours ago. He took a swim even when he felt uncomfortable.  So we are swimming the same pool which a man died in.  Maybe next swimming lessons, *I* might die too. Of fatigue.  Oh, and I added a few add-ons to my blog and went for some Personality Disorder Test. Check out the bottom for results. Btw, the highest one can go is Extremely high (which is bad) after which is very high. So I am quite okay after all.  Sheng Hao, u might wanna go try it l
