computer class i was running a lil late that when i came in i immediately clarified to mam lintag that im not late (which was supposed to be 'im not absent') with my usual joking intonation. she answered back 'yes you are' and i explained that i just picked some stuff up still grinning a lil bit. she then commented that 'its not cute' then i answered back 'its not not cute nga'. then all of a sudden she blurted out loud that 'you keep on answering'. and then it hit me thats she is not in a good mood. i just said sorry and sat down. thnx to my big mouth i got humiliated.   just when i thought it was over my mouth strikes again as i said some stuff that paved way to some issues between me and my pinakabest friend. ( i need not to elaborate on that since its way too personal ). but all's well between us now.  aside from the fact that i should keep my mouth shut i should also keep in mind just like Niel "the higher power" Lim said, to   THINK BEFORE I SPEAK THINK BEFORE I SPEAK THINK BEFORE I SPEAK THINK BEFORE I SPEAK THINK BEFORE I SPEAK  sometimes you just have to control it you know... as much as you wanna burst out your ideas you just have to keep it in...  moving on, i already signed up at Gmail, thanks to blogger... my eadd would be janenriquez@gmail.com. cant wait to use up the 1000MB capacity! wehehehe  mica called kanina to tell me about her father's death. it was so sad because he died of an operation. i didnt quite get the story coz i was busy getting the multimedia projector when she called which explains why i wasnt able to 'symphatize' with her that much because i was a bit destracted.  i went home early to clean my room, do some laundry so that i can go watch the UAAP season opening tomorrow at the araneta. for sure this will be a blast with all the school spirit and deafening cheers from competing universities.  ano pa ba... thats basically it for now. tomorrow will be our acquaintance party and la pa rin ako isusuot, bahala na lang siguro. for sure i could find a way naman.
Obviously this is my first post here in my new blogger account. IN fairness blogger has a new look *applaudes*. But regardless to that im still thinking of new concepts and only 2% done on the jounalism society website. Kulang kasi ako sa resources such as pictures and im only using html instead of flash (hehe as if marunong ako magflash). Kaya sorry na lang muna to Kuya Niel ("the higher power") kasi di ko matatapos ang site before acquaintance party on saturday. After journsoc, i have to make the journalese website din. O di ba... san ka pa... ngaragan ito! Oh well, my fault din kasi tinanggap ko yung offer. Bahala na si batman, este spiderman na lang since uso siya n
