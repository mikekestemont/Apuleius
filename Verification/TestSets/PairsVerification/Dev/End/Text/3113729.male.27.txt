be put on probation.    rule #5:  Probation (pro-bay-shun);  def.  - member's name on the blog is struck through with a line (ex. -  MikeJonze ), denoting that said member will NOT be sent any further Afterburners comps until he/she takes the necessary steps to redeem themselves (see rule #6).   rule #6:  To free yourself from Afterburners probation:  You can only do this by completing steps "A" and "B":  step A ) Ship everyone in the club 1 makeup CD mix sometime before your next turn.  step B )Come through on time with your regular CD on your next turn.  Once these requirements have been met, regular receipt of the Afterburners volumes to your mailbox will resume.   rule #7:  If you fail to carry  out rules 2 & 3 a  SECOND  time, you've totally effed up. you're gone. out of the club. no excuses. no arguments. goodbye.   rule #8:  Dave is done inviting new members. He's already invited his fair share of them. Dave, if you want mix CDs from any of your other friends, just ask them for one. Don't invite them to join Afterburners and then come to us afterwards. This is where rule #1 must be executed.  *To those have been invited into the club by Dave so far: please don't feel like an outcast. We welcome you with open arms. It's just that we have to give Dave the red light now.    rule #9:  We're dead serious about this.  Now, to put this in perspective - the recent situation with Asher's mix? How would that  be handled from now on?  Asher recently became the target of some scorn b/c we went a whole month w/o getting a mix. He said he was going to get something to us, as was his obligation. He couldn't pull through for whatever reason and, to make matters worse, he didn't get anybody to replace him. Because these rules hadn't been clearly defined before, he's off the hook this time. But in the future, he would be put on probation in this situation. Refer to rules 5 & 6 above if you still don't know what that means.  Ben and I think these rules are more than fair. They have been set up to weed out the non-committal.  So, do you guys think these are some acceptable rules? Because, we need some rules here or this club is going into the can.
