Today, from The Net    Some questions - just click  comments  below and add a comment to answer  After learning about Wicca @ AMPED this week...  1. Do you think the Harry Potter movies are good for Christians to watch, or are they helping people know about Wicca?  2. There's a razor ad that says it "Brings out the goddess in you." Do you think this commercial is influenced by Wicca?
Today, from The Net    Sunday @ AMPED, we will discuss Wicca  and its subtle way of pointing students toward eastern religious thought. Denial of Christ's salvation is  key to this group as is their pantheistic view of God.  Come with your questions.
Today, from The Net    Last week, @  THE WAREHOUSE  during Amped, we talked about Hinduism and Buddhism. Guys and Girls, it's really important that we know that satan is out to make us not  follow Jesus and sometimes that by making us think the false gods others follow are real..  Pantheism - god is  in everything Polytheism  - many gods  The key to the eastern religions is knowing these two concepts.  Next  week - Wicca  I'll get you, my fine Pretty - and  your little Dog, too!
Today, from The the National Bible Bowl Convention   Eastside's Bible Bowl team finished 49th in the national competition this year, making to the 4th round of the tournament. Bible Bowl is a bible quizzing program where competitors memorize parts of the bible and also various facts about parts of the bible and then compete with each other to see who knows the text better. This year the text was Joshua, Judges and Ruth. Our team did very well.  Next year, the text is just the Book of Luke. If you think knowing God's word so well that you could quote it would be a neat thing to do, then see Curt or email him.  and say a word of congratulations to KC and Beka Taylor, David Sadler and Donna Ferree. (Hannah and Abigail Jones, who go to Northside, also play on our team).
