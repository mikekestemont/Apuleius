is as much Motown and hip-hop as he is ... disco. So is Beyonce. But why is Justified and Dangerously in Love more inducing to a pelvis-workout than Body Language? Can it be the reason that BL is more a "white" album than Justified (Timbaland/Neptunes) or DIL? Think Beyonce and Christina Aguilera doing vocal acrobatics and you'll find Beyonce totally breathtaking while Christina sounds like your mom's constant nagging and had her voice drowned out the music, burst and splattered all over the place like a mess. Why do black musicians still possess such superior genius and skill for rhythms? Ah ... I still love hip-hop more ...  For some dance/disco funk, I recommend Daft Punk and Basement Jaxx.
Was lying on bed, way before bedtime, and let me thoughts wander around unhindered for more than an hour. In case you're wondering where I was getting at ... I haven't reached there yet! Funny how I have this tendency to weave a web of thoughts out of a few trickles of them. Which explains why I'm probably better at plonking out an essay given a few words or writing a symphony out of a few notes than to make out how much I'd gain if I bought 1000 units of a particular share at 10 bucks sold at 20 bucks! Focus and disciplined thinking is just not me kinda game. If you asked me a simple question which requires a straight-forward answer, by the time I gave you an answer, my brain would have generated another 10 questions and 10 answers ... which is where my "delay" came from.  Next time, just don't ask me a simple question with a quick answer okay? ^_^  So ... where was I?  O Yeah ... as I was brushing me teeth, a baby cockroach lost its way in the sink. When I'm done, he'd have been choking in me white-foamed spit and get sucked into the drainhole. I once quote a poem, on a whiteboard:   "Self-Pity"  I never saw a wild thing sorry for itself. A small bird will drop frozen dead from a bough without ever having felt sorry for itself.    D.H.Lawrence    A friend asked me how I know that the small bird doesn't feel sorry for itself. I never quite knew how to answer him then and I couldn't remember what me answer was but on seeing the cockroach dragging its hind legs helplessly trying to climb up the wall of the wet, slippery sink ... I saw an enormous will to live. Would I have wanted to live this badly if I knew what a pitiful state I'm in? If I were him, I'd probably have jumped into a toaster when the heating element is on full blast. D.H.Lawrence was right afterall, the pity is in our eyes. Even when we see a scene like this, the pity is on the human condition reflected through the lives of these little creatures. They never know what self-pity means.  I didn't flush it down the hole. Live and let live ...  namo amitaba  .
