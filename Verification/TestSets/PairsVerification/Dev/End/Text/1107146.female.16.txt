I'm supposed to be in bed, but I got a trileptal buzz and I can't do it. Har har, this shit is great. And while I'm in such a weird mood, I wanted to let you all know that I got a 5 on the English AP exam, so eat it&nbsp; :)&nbsp; j/k. I'll never do that good again. But yes. Very strange, that. It's a very strange night, I'm going to regret being so boastful in the morning. Not trying to, but...you know. Sometimes these things just happen. I thought I'd die on that one. Eh. Actually, I thought I'd die on U.S. history, but I got a 4 so it's all good. I'm going to shut up now and find some place to fall over, peace all.
as for the first one, certainly, as for the second, It doesn't matter one iota to me, you and josh are the only ones who really know her
Ok, so I was just thinking, and you don't really have to say yes, it's just an opinion thing. (Wow, can you tell I have self-esteem issues, geez.)  Two questions: 1) What do yall think about putting Becca on the blog?  She does seem to be a rather big part of our lives, and quite frankly it just might liven up the blog a little bit.  2)  What do you think about taking Abby off the blog?  She isn't exactly contributing anymore, and I don't know about yall (ok, probably nobody else but Josh) I don't like her being able to see everything that's going on while she's in this little anti-Lindsey mood that she's currently in.  I also wanted to note that the URL of the blog will be changing here in a few days as soon as I get some inspiration for the same reason.  Anyone have ideas?  Ok, just wondering.  Please post your opinion ASAP or it may just not get counted.
well here you go;  something  there I said something. but anyway,  I feel miffed, you didn't invite me to spend the night, see if I help you with calc, econ, and stat.   :-P   Oh well, that aside, the back bedroom is clean so you can just start living over here, josh don't get jealous, she's not gonna leave you for me.   anyway, after pissing off lindsey and josh, i guess it's rosie's turn, but since she doesn't seem to actually be here...aw well as if that has ever stopped me before.  you're just setting yourself up to be hurt, but you're not gonna listen to me so I don't know why I'm even saying this.  now I don't believe I've left anybody out, but if I have just start screaming at me and I'll rectify the situation.  wow, I just read back over my post and I came to the conclusion that I'm a jerk, someone throw something at me.
Ok, seriously people, someone say something.  This is one seriously boring blog.  And let's not even start on the subject of Josh's poor blog, which has been neglected for almost a full w
