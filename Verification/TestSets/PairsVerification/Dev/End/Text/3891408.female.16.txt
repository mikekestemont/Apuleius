wonder what things would be like...like would you and that person you were dating..would u end up together in the end? Or that friend you are no longer friends with because of some stupid fight...still be lifelong friends?? I think you should just follow you heart and where ever that leads you...thats where you belong. Even if that means hurting someone you really love to make yourself happy.  There has been so much drama going around lately and its not necessary. I wish people would just be honest with everyone and tell them exactly what they are thinking...though that may not always be a good thing...but it would lessen the drama and conflict. The truth doesnt always hurt...its the lies that kill((so true!))
Well this is my first of many. This seems like a good way to just say what you have to say and get on with your life. So much D-R-A-M-A has been going on lately and it really shouldnt. I mean come on were only 16 years old...we shouldnt have to deal with all this stuff. Like boyfriends and stupid people who like all that drama all the time. Ive gone through alot lately...like breaking up with my boyfriend of 7 1/2 months and ive realized if your not happy...then get out. Because as time goes on it gets harder and harder to end it. And if you think that by staying with them, hoping it will get better. It wont...take it from me. You just have to follow your heart and not always your head. And its hard sometimes especially when you head and heart are in conflict. And its like ill always love him, but the relationship just didnt last. I have the best friends in the whole world and theyve helped me get through soo much!! And i love you guys to death!! I have no idea what id do without you guys. And im soo sorry for before when i barely saw you guys but now we are closer than ever!! And i have soo much fun with you guys that i forget all the drama thats going on. My girl Melissa has to be the best friend EVER!!!Thanks hun for always helping me through stuff...weve been through soo much together. I love you to death.  The past few days have been soo much fun!! Well on Thurs. me Linz,Melissa,and Kathy were all finally able to hang out...which is like amazing because usually one of us has work.
