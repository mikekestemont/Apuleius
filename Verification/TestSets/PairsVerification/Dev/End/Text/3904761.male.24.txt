of money. If they're based on experience, then he wins a bit. If on qualifications, I win. If on need, then we should be about equal. Although he has a wife and child, his wife works, and I have a year and a bit's worth of study loans to get rid of.  My boyfriend earns more than twice what I do, but I tend to be less irritated about that. He's extremely skilled, and a very good problem solver. He also working during holidays for his company for a couple of years while studying. Not that I'm absolutely fine with it. Just less irritated by it than by my colleague.  The other taboos I've come across are more normal. Don't talk about religion. Don't talk about politics. I know what the religious leanings of 1 of the people I share this office with are. The rest, not a clue.     There's something I need to put down here, and it's about souls. Nothing religious. I don't have one. While waiting for interminable FTP sessions to complete over the last couple of days, I've been browsing ghost photos. They're really interesting. Most of them are of orbs and funny lights, which doesn't really do it for me. Most of them look too much like camera failure or odd lighting conditions. The ones that make me go slightly chilly are the humanoid ones. The half-formed bodies, and hands and staring eyes.  I tend to regard myself as a rational person. I have problems identifying with any religion because I do not believe in god, or gods, or demons or anything else that goes along with that. There should be really good reasons why those photographs look like that. But I'm not finding them. I don't know enough about the circumstances of each photo to be able to say "yes, well, they left it on long exposure and someone wandered through and that's why there's a blurry human-shaped blob in the middle." Wish I could, but I can't.  And there's something that happened to my mom a couple of years ago that seems to have affected her a bit. She was nursing an old friend of hers, who was in the last stages of dying from skin cancer. He was at his sister's house, and mom drove up to help out for the last few days. He didn't last long; about 48 hours after he got there he died. But it was what happened right after he died that seemed to freak my mom out a bit. She said that he was lying in bed in a room with the curtains drawn, as he was fairly sensitive to light. The curtains weren't very heavy, and were blowing in the breeze a bit. More to the point, the wind outside was pushing against them, so that they were bulging inward slightly. Mom said that as David finally died, they blew the other way, just for a second. She likened it to something leaving the room, going out through the curtain. I don't know. I really d
