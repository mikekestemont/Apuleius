and managed to survive with even just an ounce of love in their hearts, I hate their parents for what they have done. You try to have empathy, to place yourself in their shoes. But, sometimes, you lose all sense of empathy for people. After interviewing a 12 year old girl, who came to tears when talking about how she tried to dress "ugly" for her moms boyfriends so they wouldnt touch her; and who knew what kind of drugs her mom did; and talked about her moms boyfriend who punched her mom in the face, and she had to watch; and then turn around and talk about how much she loves her mom, and she only wishes she would call her. At that moment, you realize that so many things in your own life are trivial, and stupid. And there are the times when I wonder if my job makes any difference- because the scars are already there, and were merely put bandaids on a bleeding wound. CPS is just one big band-aid.
Well, apparently the omen from yesterday has carried over into today. HAHA.  I woke up this morning with such a positive, "its a new day" attitude. I had a text message from Michael at 12:15am stating he had just gotten the text I sent him like 4 hours prior..:) But seeing a text message from him first thing in the morning, added a smile. :)So, I thought to myself...SURELY today will be better than yesterday...Riiiiight. They sent my paycheck to Murworth again, so I was off to there first thing this morning. I really still dont understand WHY they keep doing that, but I go pick it up nevertheless. Thats my money!!!  I talked to Tina this morning. Her date with Michael went quite well last night. No, not the SAME Michael, a different one than I know..what a coincidence?:) They went to some fancy italian place. Shes all excited. She tries not to be, but I can hear it in her voice, which cracks me up. We are so much the same sometimes.  Still no definite plans for July 4th. No one ever wants to make a decision, and then of course, we end up doing nothing. Tina wants to go to Bar Houston tomorrow night, which would be fun. We havent been in a while. Plus I will officially be on vacation, so watch out! :) Saturday Im going to church with Michael and to see fireworks...Im really looking forward to it. Ill be happy to see him again. He makes me laugh and smile so much. Sometimes my heart just races a million miles a minute.  Well, its only noon and Ive already- gotten splashed with mud by a speeding vehicle, gotten locked out of my building, and gotten all kinds of crappy email about what I did and didnt do. What a fun Thursday! :) I need to go type up some reports and then head to Clear Lake for an interview this afternoon with one of my new trainees. Will post more l
