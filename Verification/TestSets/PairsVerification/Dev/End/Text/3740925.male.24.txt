think there was any love or lust between these two highly ambitious people.  They saw the chance to create a legitimate heir to rule over the entire world.  Of course, their son didn't survive long.  It's little wonder Octavian viewed Cleopatra and her son as such an enormous threat.
It's been a little while since I wrote last.  I moved and I've been busy and haven't felt the urge to write.  I've begun looking for a part-time job.  I'm researching grad schools.  I'm getting my apartment organized.  And I'm trying to have a life.  I'm having mediocre success on most fronts.  I may have met a cool guy.  We've e-mailed a few times since last week.  He goes to Rice.  He'll live very close to me in a few weeks.  He looks cute too.  I really need a boyfriend to talk to.  I need someone to make me feel less like a freak.  For some reason I made the mistake of reading about a particular closeted Hollywood actor and his semi-closeted boyfriend and their alleged hook-ups.  They're all so hedonistic.  It really bothers me.  I guess I shouldn't care, except that when I was that age and needed someone to look up to, there was no one.  In my search for someone to look up to, all I found were dirty whores and old men.  I saw none of myself in either.  It caused me a lot of pain and, frankly, still does.  Oh well, maybe someday young gay men will be well adjusted enough to show some modesty and realize that sex isn't a substitute for love.
Well, I took the GRE today.  Since no one will read this, I can brag.  I got an average score on the Verbal section, 540.  But I got a 730 on the Analytical section.  WOO-FUCKIN-HOO!  I knew I was at least a little smart.  Anyway, I got the keys to my new apartment.  I may need them to fix the AC tomorrow.  The apartment was a little warm the two times I was there yesterday.  Other than that, it was nice.  I can't get over how big it is.  Moving will be a bitch, as it always is.  I went to Miyako with some friends tonight.  Hollis, Andres, Lauren Farr, Roxanne, and two of Jenny's friends were there.  Jenny and William weren't able to make it.  It's always surreal being around Andres.  He's openly gay and I am not.  Of course, he also has that annoying know-it-all attitude that way too many gay men have.  Andres is particularly bad.  He's a nice guy, I just can't stand it when he slips into know-it-all mode.  I used to have a problem with that.  I think I've suppressed myself sufficiently.  I try anyway.    Tonight I realized why I chose not to tell Hollis.  I don't want him to be part of my personal life.  I just don't know if I like him any more as a friend.  I'm really tired.  I got maybe 4 hours of sleep last night.  I need to go to bed.  Good n
