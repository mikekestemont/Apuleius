follow through the contract.  He paid for my visa trip to Japan, for my airplane ticket from Canada, monthly salaries are directly deposited to my bank account... again no complaints! By the way the contract is very standard, so you're basically getting the same deal as most foreign teachers.  Which is pretty darn good.  I've managed to save here a lot more money than I would back home.  The living conditions are good.  The oneroom apartment I live in is pretty big compared to other teachers' rooms I've seen.  The building is fairly new, so again, it's clean, it has everything: bed, tv/vcr, fridge, drawer, 2 burner stove, shower, a.c., heating.  The location is great, you'll be five minutes from the PNU which is one of the downtown areas.  If you like to go out there's a couple of clubs just blocks from the apartment.  Food is cheap, you'll probably eat out mostly, but there is a supermarket very close to the school.  Overall, I would recommend this school, because the staff is good, the hours are good, I get paid on time, the kids are good (in some schools the kids throw things at the foreign teachers...this type of behavior does not occur at this school), and the location is really good.  I have been teaching children and adults now for the past three years, so I know quite a bit.  If I stay in Busan when you come, I'll give you a proper tour and also give you lots of advice and tips about living here.  If you have more questions, let me know.  Take care Kelly and good luck to you.  Respectfully,  Xxxxx Xxxxx

Why I am moving to Korea.   I was browsing another blog and ran across a great reply. I have modified it to meet my own devices here. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Why AM I moving to Korea? Here is a brief list:  -Because I can. -Because America (mostly its president) is particularly insane these days. -Because I have nothing to lose. And a lot of loans to repay. -Because I needed to vacate Milwaukee, and most other American places would lead to another vacuous office job. -Because it's much more exciting than most other options. -Because I needed to simplify my existence and stop nesting. Twenty-four is too early to n
