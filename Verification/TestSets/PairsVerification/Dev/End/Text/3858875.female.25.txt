found a new hairdresser - was waiting until my meeting on friday to get my hair snipped. i think i'm going to have quite a lot taken off.   learned a new word today: austintatious! cheesy, eh? a prospective roommate emailed me and used it. he also said basically nothing nice about where he lives except that it's on the bus route to UT and has a nice pool. a lot of places i've found advertised are in these gated apartment communities for students. what do students, of all people, need to be protected from? roommate searching is so much fun...
watch out austin, outlaw liss is comin' into town!  I'm just using this silly snapshot i took with my iSight to test out how to post photos using flickr. don't think it'll be as popular as chris' photo over on will's site, however! 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink lissa eyes 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink lissa .

C: A lot of East Indians J: East Indian Gangsters C: And then there's a lot of asians in Richmond J: Yeah, and all of Vancouver, too.  .... J: All these rich people who come in with their bling bling cars. It would be nice to have people who actually work hard.  C: Yeah, well in Hong Kong, where all of the 'Hongers' come from, they have this one child rule, so the one kid gets all of the wealth from the parents.  ... J: The only times I went to Richmond was to go to Ikea and to this chinese restaurant. No english was spoken. Supposed to be the best Chinese food in Vancouver.  OH MY GOD!!! I knew I live with geeks, but i didn't realize I'm living with bigots!   ooh... homophobic too:  C: This one guy i knew had like no gag reflexes, so i started calling him gay.   C: Davie's the gay district J: The gayest place on earth C: one of the guys said, you can probably buy a lot of sausages on Davie! One of the guys didn't think it was funny, but I d
