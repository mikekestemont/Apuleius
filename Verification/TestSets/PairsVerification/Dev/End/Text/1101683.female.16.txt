Ben...and Tori....and well, me. But mostly Brittan Rudolph. I just read most of her blog and plan to read it in it's entirety, eventually. Most of it was hillarious and I completely loved it. If you read this, Brittan, you get my nerdy seal of approval.  Ack. G'night folks.
I like this one...     February 3, 2003    She hides behind her smile But she too has her fears. So afraid of being needed desperately for a few short moments Then forgotten.  Like a tissue, she'll be used and so easily discarded. Chocolate chip ice cream Old and freezerburnt Behind the strawberry he now finds more appealing.  Faded and full of holes That worn-out shirt he'd rather not touch. She can remember when he used to love it Several months earlier when it was bright and new.  She doesn't want to be Just another of the many Fish in his sea. She's been thrown in and out of too many ponds.  Are her feelings justified Or just paranoia? Most likely the second. She overreacts.  What ever happened to the optomist we used to know and love? She died. With the realization that life can't be As simple as she made herself believe.
So maybe this is perfection...
salvation army church  this morning.  my aunt lissa became a "soldier", and we were invited for the ceremony. it was the smallest church i'd ever seen in a neighborhood that was borderline ghetto. ghetto-ish, if you will. the accompianists played trumpets and the church was lively and informal. during offering, several people gave as little as pennies, but i knew, just from the atmosphere, that it was appreciated. service was lead by a woman from australia and a man from south africa. they're married and have two adorable children. after church, we all went to lunch at ryan's steak house. "we all" meaning my family and half of the church. i wish i could retell the stories. it's something that sounds simple, perhaps boring, but i was compeltely interested. as well as proud and happy for my aunt lissa. she's found something that makes her so incredibly fulfilled...and that's the most anyone could ask for.   "hey, i got this outfit at the salvation army!"   hahaha. er...she's also incredibly cheesy.
home late, again.      only a half an hour. that boy makes me never want to leave. and all we did was play video games and eat mcdonald's at craig's.  i think that's my favorite combination: ben, craig, me. we compliment each other perfectly. i don't feel like i'm ignored or ignoring someone else. we do it all; late-night conversations, hackey sack, hackey sack  fights , video games, trips to springfield, 5a.m. bike rides. i wish summer could last forever. i wish mom would go camping again so that i could stay out all night. i wish that i could just stop time when we're lying in criag's living room talking about our dreams and our futures.  so now i'm just wondering how i got along without them for so long.  that includes jeff and rohan, as well. i love my b
