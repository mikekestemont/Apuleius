grandparents i would drive an hour and a half to his apartment and spend the night waiting on him to get home. he spoiled me. we had long weekends in chalets, we would go shopping and hed buy me anything i wanted. was so good to me. one night we were driving around and decided it would be fun to get a room at a cheap sleazy motel and scew our brains out. there we were in this place with cinderblock walls and cigarette burns on the sheets, humping like bunnies, and out of nowhere, way out of left field he looks right at me and says : "i love you, you know that right?" well of corse i knew it but it was the first time he said it.we layed there for hours watching an osbornes marathon, and making out, and i know it dosent sound very romantic, but it is such a great memory. my son and i moved in with him a few months later. and after living together for about 4 months we found out i was pregnant with our daughter. we got married in a cheap little chapel.it was great.were pretty happy. he really is the smartest person i know. and being married is so great, hes my best friend and we really are as close as you could possibly be. not to say we dont have our fights,lifes not perfect and sometimes it would be easier to be on my own, but i would really miss him.
so here it is. everything about me and what im going to ramble aimlessly about in this blog, which no one will probably read but here goes anyhow..... im 23 , married female with 2 children, Liam who is almost 4 years, and Ella-Blue who is almost 7 months now. untill recently i was a stay -at -home mom, but have returned to my career in pharmacology. sounds totally exciting i know but such is life. my husband, scott, and i have been married for a little over a year, and have been together for over 2 years now.i guess the reason im talking out in the open this way instead of keeping a diary is that i really have no friends ( where we live, way up in the country,  far far away from where i grew up), and sometimes i just have random thoughts and no one to share them with.i like to write short stories, poems, haikus and stuff. i love punk music ( not pop punk, the good shit) but im a total girly girl, i love shopping and makeup and shoes and all that, but still im not a total airhead.lol. i read alot, watch quirky movies, my husband works nights so i dont really sleep much, so there will prolly be veery looooong boring posts on here with me talking about stupid  things like how i wish we had cable so i could just put my brain on auto pilot for a few hours and get some sleep....... to be continued tomorrow n
