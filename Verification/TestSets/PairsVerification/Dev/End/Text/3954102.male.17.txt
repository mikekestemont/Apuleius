to golden fishes, to star-catching 'octopuses'.. its very interesting to populate your tank with such fishes and watch the constant barrage of money.. i had a 'star shower', a 'the sky is dropping money (at an insane rate)' and of course 'diamond mania! (diamonds were popping up and falling down)' i was too busy clicking like a madman trying to pick up ALL cash.. trust me on one thing, after you finish the game, you will wonder how many times you clicked the damned mouse.. the game can get VERY hectic and insane later.. its very  very   very   very     very         fun.. i highly recommend it... i killed like 3 hours on the game... before i went on with my life.. (eating lunch and writing this blog) =X yes it is that addictive too.. (kudos to eunice for intro-ing the game to me)       me and my sis was shouting many things the whole afternoon, like "tua eng kong", "stop farting lah you &#$^!", "die you stupid alien", "AAAIIEEEE! my fishes!!!", "feed feed! money there!!!" and many more..  try the damn game.. my declaration of love comes up next..   LOVE MAKING IS GREAT! I  LOVE   IT!!     I LIKE MAKING LOVE!!  love making damn song ;) i cant get this morning out of my mind *winks* =D ( you get my meaning dont you? =P)  one more thing i really gotta splash is Magister Negi Magi (Mo Fa Lao Shi) 6 is out, and the book is AWESOME! the fight scenes are damn tense and had a firm grip on my sights and attention non stop... damn nice sia =D but i went down yesterday and today to cp to find Get Backers 26 to no avail.. wasted 2 trips =X when is it gonna come out~~ *gripes*  i dun wanna talk too much.. or else alot of ppl will complain my blog is too damned long... =X also got a very big headache after making so much love this morning... so gonna sign sign off~!
