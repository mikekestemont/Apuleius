weekend I will be okay. I have traffic school on Saturday and really not looking forward to it. Today I bought a new computer workstation. It fits my apartment so much better and it's really cute. Now I need to buy a entertainment center and a new tv, then I will be complete. I can't believe how much I have been sleeping since I have been sick. It seems all I do is sleep. Which is nice because I love sleeping. I don't have any plans for this weekend really. I have theatre tickets on Sunday, so I won't be able to go to church. But I'm still going to hang out with my friends afterwards. Ohhh, geeze, it's been so hot lately. I need to go buy a little fan because it's totally miserable. I hate not having air conditioning. Ohh, wait, I won't be complete just with an entertainment center! I still need to buy a little kitchen table. Just a little two seater table. Then my apartment will be complete. Ahh, I can't wait. I just need more money! Ok, I'm going to go get ready for bed. I'm already feeling better :)
Having Hannah here was so refreshing. It was good just to relax and hang out and have fun. We did a lot of fun stuff together, but mostly we just loved being in each others company. I wish we lived closer and could hang out all of the time. I often think about living close to my cousins and having that sort of relationship with them and how it would go. I bet I would just love it. I'm trying to convince Hannah to go to grad school down here next year, so that way we could live together. That would be so much fun. Well, Chris eventually called me, but I'm so over it. I talked to him a couple of times, but he's so shady and I have no clue on what he thinks about. I had a date on Friday with some other guy named Chris and he is totally nice. But I don't know if I totally like him. He's a little bit shorter than me, and I don't know if he's my type. It really doesn't matter though because he's moving to Utah at the end of the month anyway. Which puts less pressure on me. Then Mike from Huntington Beach called me Friday to go out with me. When it rain, it pours. He is a totally cool guy too, and I could actually see myself liking him, maybe. I dunno. I should give him another try. He has his life together, which is better than the other guys I've been going out with. Enough with my love life, I'm so poor right now. I wish I made more money. I thought living on my own I would have more money, but I was wrong. I need to get my finances in order. There are so many things I need to do. Geeze. Okay, I better go to bed. L
