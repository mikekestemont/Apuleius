the drift.  Well...more later...  *edit*  Noticed something during lunch time. Walking with a pregnant woman changes the way people look at you. Everyone is nice to you all of a sudden. That's strange... but I'm taking Sami everywhere I go from now on :-)  *edit2*  3) Would having a kid  be more like playing god or guardian?  You give life, you shape life, and then you watch the results.  If you think about it....ever single one of us gets to play god in our lifetimes.  So I wonder, why do we worship something that we ourselves possess the power to do?  We can Give Life (Birth) We can Shape Life (Raise Kids) We can Take Life (Kill) We have the determination and skills to even perform miracles. (child birth, space travel, self healing)  So why dont we take the energy we put into praying and use it to better ourselves.  Make ourselves better parents, better educators, better protectors, better scientists.  I dont know why...maybe someone can enlighten me.  I am not saying that god doesnt exist...I dont want to touch that subject :-)
So, I decided to start a blog.  I was thinking of a way to jot down all the preparation and excitement that our family shares, waiting for the arrival of our baby.  Oh ... BTW...I should mention that my wife of almost 2 years (Sami) is 7 months pregnant with our DAUGHTER.   I cant wait for her to arrive.  I will spoil her rotten.  Had the baby shower this weekend, and it was a boat load of fun.  We hosted a party at India Palace II restaurant in Morrisville, and a lot of family members showed up.  Looking at all the family together, gets me to notice...how each generation seems to get further apart from each other, and the rest of the family.  It's really sad, because that's a great part of being Indian.... is the family ties.  I will try my best to make sure that the generation that FOLLOWS me, will be better kept in touch with their uncles, aunts and cousins.  Anyways...enough of the sappy stuff, and more about the party.  It was a blast... there were many individual performances.  One in particular surprised me.... My cousin Priyesh.  I have always thought of him as a more reserved kind of a person...caring...but reserved.  His dancing in the party will be one of the best memories of how much fun the party really was.  My sister Dolly also partook in a dance, which also surprised me..in a good way.  All in all , everyone did a excellent job in showing their happiness through their dancing.  Me & Sami would like to heartfully thank (In no particular order :) ) Dolly, Priyesh, Kunal, Tushar, Smruti,  Angad, Arjun, Paul, Mannu, Hannu, Deserie(sp?), Sukku, Pooja and Palak for their dances.  Hope you guys had as much fun as I did.  I will try to update this blog as I decide to share more information/ feelings about the coming baby, and events surrounding.
