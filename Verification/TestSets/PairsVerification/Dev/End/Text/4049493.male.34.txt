Now, he has to select the pending transaction at his store for transmission. He can’t read the name on the display and begins his own version of hooked on phonics which was more painful for me than you can imagine. Our language was being terrorized.

I then suggested he take down the Western Union sign until he could master the intricate process of operating equipment designed to be understood by a 12 year old. The money didn’t make it. What does this say for the state of our business infrastructure? We have systems whose front end is literally “English as a second language” – can we survive like this? Called Sprint PCS lately? The electric company? All the same. And just wait till VoIP technologies become practical enough to take support of these systems off shore in the fashion IT call centers are following.

Furthermore, the taxes that are being lost because of problems in our commerce systems are still being spent to support people who have no job, no insurance, and no intention to secure either.
