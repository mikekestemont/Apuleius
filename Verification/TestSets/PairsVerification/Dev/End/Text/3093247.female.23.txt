people of carol stream (or at least who were there tonight) are all right.  probably most of them are struggling to make ends meet one way or another (even the golf guys).  the fathers were dancing with their kids.  the kids were hilarious; one kid kept playing air guitar between shoving matches with his sister (who fell in the mud but didn't cry - my kind of kid!)  and not a single adult with any conteporary fashion sense.  i was the only person for at least a decade in either direction my age.  in the end, none of this matters.  the fireworks were awesome.  i didn't blink for a full 30 minutes.  i love the m80s.  and there were these new fireworks that would pop white, fade, and then all the little sparks would explode all over again - NOT like ths shooting star ones that dribble down the sky - thsee would explode while still in the form of the first explosion's circle, so it was like a million little firework exlosions held in this big smoke frame.  hard to explain.  but cool to see.  happy 4th.
Fireworks!  I love the 4th!  Not that I've seen any yet, but today i got to march in the parade!  i didn't actually get to see the parade, which was weird... didn't hear the bands or the sirens or anything except the crowd cheering and waving and some of the women pointing at me and saying "look!  a woman infiltrated the ranks!"  For i was part of the carol stream rotary club precision shopping cart drill team, which is comprised almost entirely of 40+ year old businessmen.  and then there was me.  actually, the guy behind me was my age; he got suckered in to march by his dad like i was.  so we bonded.  so that was fun.  my dad got to do his citizen of the year thing in a sweet red convertible (with my mom at the helm).  it's weird to do the 4th on the 3rd.  but i'm not complaining; that just means two days of fireworks!
ode to the removal of old boyfriends (or at least surpassing them, or beating their demands, or whatever evil things they want)..........  i started my new job today.  since being hired for 'A' coordinator position, i have re-interviewed twice for other positions that i was contacted about.  they hired me for day camps.  and then this morning, after interviewing for a physically handicapped/wheelchair basketball position (our team, btw, is the reigning state champs in the IHSA league for WC Bball), i got it!  so i'm doing PH sports!  and also running events for people with mental illnesses.  woo hoo!  then tonight i played indoor soccer for the first time.  it rocked.  and i almost scored.  indoor is a lot like rugby 7s i think.. fast and furious; smaller teams, shorter games, lots and lots of sweat.  so, to all you old boyfriends who thought i was fat and unmotivated, to quote good ole monty, "i fart in your general direction."  wherever that may b
