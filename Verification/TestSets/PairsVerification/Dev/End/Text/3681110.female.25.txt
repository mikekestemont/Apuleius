your head".  well if it's in my head why is my body suffering?   i'll update when i get back.
it doesn't matter if i get 8 hours of sleep or 12 hours.  it doesn't matter if i eat healthy foods or fast food.  i could exercise all day or be a couch potato.   i am always exhausted!   yesterday when i got home from work i let the puppies out and then crashed for about and hour and a half until kevin called me to dinner.  this has been going on for a few weeks now and i am increasingly becoming concerned.  i even looked up Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Anemia on webmd.com.  i certainly would not self-diagnose myself, that is just not safe, but, reading the symptom list Anemia could be the problem.  i called my general practitioner to schedule an appointment on friday.  maybe he can do a lab work up and see if anything turns up.  i also spoke to minnesota to try and schedule a Reiki session.  if anything, i would get a good nap out of it.
the roles have been reversed with me and my parents (or is it my parents and i?).  i have been trying to call my mom for the past two days and keep getting her voicemail.   sidenote: my parents sold my childhood home a month ago and they are living in a mobile home park in their 2000 edition, 35 foot long Winnebago.   i begin to worry.  this is not like my parents at all.  sure they are retirees, but you can't just pick up and leave and not tell your children.  i call my aunt in atlanta.  no word.  i call both of my sisters.  no word there either.  i call my dad's best friend, nada.  i can't remember the name to the mobile home park so i just start randomly calling in the area.  i finally reached the right place and spoke with a nice man who understood my situation and tells me that they said they were going to lake lanier.  i leave another voice message for the 'rents again.  "what do you mean, just leaving the state and not telling me?!  i am about to file a missing persons report.  for all i know you could be dead in a ditch somewhere!"  doesn't that sound familiar?  needless to say mom called me back.  unfortunately i was away from my desk and she had to leave me a message.  darn it!  i was going to ground her for a month!
drama - if you've got it, get away from me!  car stereos turned up so loud it shakes your windows  wasps  dating bartenders  people who don't like my dogs  cats - they are spiteful creatures  people who say they "love" a band, but only because of one song on the radio - i told you i was a music snob  people who use you up   that is about it for now.  i'm not in a particularly hateful mood today, so there isn't much to put on the list.  it's early t
