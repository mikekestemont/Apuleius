home. This time the airport was in Montreal. I went to get some food from the fast food place there. As I was walking back, I saw everyone checking in, so I rushed to the counter and tried to check in. They said that they couldn't find my ticket. Then the clerk took me to this shelter across the tarmac, where everyone was waiting. We talked to my music teacher, but he said he couldn't buy me another ticket. He then suggested for me to call my parents to pick me up, ever though it was a 3 hour drive (one way) to get to Montreal). Then the clerk told him about this "traveler in distress" pass, which if I were to go on standby, I could get onto a flight for free if there were any seats available. So the clerk took me back to the counter and I used a pay-phone to call my parents and I explained the situation. Then as I turned around, I saw my mother standing there, looking around for me. I ran up to her, hugged her, and I woke up.
I was biking along my usual route, but when I got to the point where there's a big field, but instead there was a house in the middle. So I went up to the house and found out that my step-grandfather owns it (but in reality he lives in Costa Rica). I went inside and it looked like he was having a party, it was crammed with people.

By my legs were their bass guitars (since they play bass and electric in a band). After a while, Mitchell stood up and played a solo. I don't know why, but I reached down, picked up Jordan's bass and started plucking on it. The crowed was going crazy over Mitchell's solo but was "boo"ing me at the same time. After his solo, Mitchell started yelling at me, asking why I ruined his solo. I said I was just trying to help. After that little outburst, I slunk off to the bedroom, but as I got through the doorway, it turned into the deck of the people next door at our cottage. Then three ravens started swooping around me. I fell to the ground and curled up, while two were somewhat pecking at my neck. They weren't actually biting me nor pecking, but just nudging it while the third raven stood about 2 feet away, just w
