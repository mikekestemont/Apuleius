I still dragged it with me in my already heavy purse. When you're involved in a long-distance relationship, there are certain things that you do to help you feel closer to your significant other. For me, it was never just a wallet - it was a symbol of our relationship.  A symbol of the fact that for once in my life somebody actually thought I was so special that I deserved my very own $400 designer wallet.  I guess to some people it wouldn't seem very important, but to somebody like me who grew up thinking that happy meals & Barbie clothes were outrageously expensive and the JC-Penney's Christmas catalog was the height of luxury, the idea of owning a $400 dollar wallet was one thought I'd never even entertained. As I think about the wallet now, YRB inevitably turns back into OREB (Overly-Romanticized Ex-Boyfriend).   OREB was so thoughtful.   He told me that I deserved that wallet.  That I shouldn't settle for anything less.  And now I look at it like it's some kind of cruel joke, a bitter reminder that maybe he was lying all along.  Oddly enough we ended up talking about the wallet during what would become one of our last conversations. I was telling him an anecdote about my afternoon and how I had dumped the contents of my purse onto the floor at a computer store when I was unable to find my car keys.   There at the feet of three kind Russian men, I tried not to cry as I fumbled through my belongings looking for the keys that I would later find in my back pocket.  As I searched through the crumpled Kleenexes, tattered bus schedules and receipts, unopened bills, sticky bottles of lotion, broken tubes of lipstick, pens, pencils, and a hodge-podge of candy wrappers I thought about one of the first lessons I'd learned in my Fiction classes this year - that the best way to reveal a character is through minor details such as the contents of their cupboards, cars, and even purses.   I thought about the fact that I carried this heavy bag with me everyday but now that I was seeing what it contained it all seemed so foolish. Everything was basically garbage, nothing of note, nothing to set me apart.  The only thing it seemed to say was that I was too lazy to clean, completely frazzled and disorganized, but somehow or another had landed a beautiful wallet that looked out of place beside all the clutter in my life.  Now I worry if I give away that wallet, what will I be left with? Will I be proud of the strength it will take to finally move forward and let go of OREB?  Or will I be letting go of the one thing in my life that really meant something just to make a few quick bucks?   So now I pose this question to all of you my friends(yes, all three of you) - when it comes to the wallet, Should it stay or should it g
