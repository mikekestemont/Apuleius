all. sure... it's nice to look good and to have nice things. like brands names and extra toys. but how will that help you when someone's hurting, when someone's crying, when someone's in need. so, in the end, when i really think about, i'm glad i was born poor with parents who understand what's really important. all people are equal... no matter which one has more money.   sorry for going all deep. but yea, i spent sometime with people who have a very different idea of happiness than i do. uh, yesterday i went to andrea's and we went swimming, lots of boobs involved (freaky). then we headed on over to riverside park. guess what... yes, there was a ferris wheel!!!! but... my friends thought it was too expensive (it was, it cost 3$) and i didn't get to go on it. we saw lots of people that we know or did know... or recognize. ben p. died his hair and he looks really fucking hot with it. well then ,we watched fireworks (andrea, heather, alexa, me, andrew, cory and even nathan kinda). i went home and then this morning i went out to breakfast with heather and her grandparents and mom. i'm home now andi just got up to answer the phone and i kind of fell over. not really, but i was just going to sit back down and i fell onto the stool. i'd know what i'd like right now... to be  b l a z e d. lots of love, ~bekah~
hey babes. i'm back. yea that's right.. shake the house down. speaking of which. my porch is pretty.  i loved kristin's cottage minus the cowell's. but it was so much fun. then i went to sauble and we met two guys... who surprisingly are brothers. one's a year older than me and one's a year older than emily. so we hung out with them. and they live in guelph. which was a surprise. i'm in love with sauble. like... IN LOVE. i missed so many people when i was away. one of which.. my brother, but i saw him and gave him clothes i bought him. by the way i have so many new clothes. kind of sad really. but amazingly cool. and i miss andrea. and i miss heather. and i miss rachelle. and now i miss kristin, but not as much as others... well maybe as much as rachelle, lol. and i miss brianne. and eric, i've written to you and i'm on my second page! hah! ... i miss tennis and soccer. maybe i'll go play some now before heather comes over. oh my god do i miss her. and i can't wait to see andrea. i came back a couple days early. but i think i'm going to my grandparents for a couple of days to help my brother deal with their retardedness. oh yea.. i have a pretty good tan for me. it's not like, sexellent or anything. but it's alright. thanks for the emails guys. see you soon guys. love, *
