make life worth living. Sondheim and Soderbergh, Neil Jordan to Neil Gaiman, these people and thousands more taught me about life, love, and, how to be a better person. How else could we share our lives with others? Real, make-believe, it doesn't matter. On a screen 40 feet high or around a table in a diner with friends. Truth and fiction both can teach us about real life. Telling the story often makes us feel better, taking our thoughts and experiences, organizing them, and, throwing them into the world is freeing. Much like this short essay which I now offer to you. It all starts with the telling. The telling helps. Sometimes, it's the telling of the story that matters.  Stories I Tell-- Toad The Wet Sprocket  Don't give me answers for I would refuse  "yes" is a word for which I have no use  And I wasn't looking for heaven or hell  Just someone to listen to stories I tell    Now what is a blessing and what is a dream  Caught between portraits and none's what it seems  And why is it people expect there's a change  When I feel I'm a part of something I can't see  I feel the same    Now don't ask me questions or I will retreat  Fame is a cancer and ego its seed  Now I wasn't looking for heaven or hell  Just someone to listen to stories I tell    Do we ever wonder?  And do you ever care...    Subtle salvation in poems we know  Hiding our heads in a shadow of home  Now I wasn't looking for wreaths or for bells  Just someone to listen to stories I tell  Stories I tell

The big project was filming and editing a half hour comedy special that took place at  urlLink The Belcourt Theatre.  It was a great show and I'm really happy with the way the DVD turned out. Many thanks to Matt Sterling and Jonathan Richter for the animation and advice.   Notice that I said I FINISHED my biggest project to date, I still have a HUGE FRIGGEN' project with  urlLink Joe Southards  thats due at the end of the month.  The short was shown as part of a sketch comedy show that took place at Bongo Java(whose site is down otherwise I'd give 'em a friendly link). Actually I got to show three things I've been working on: a commerical for  urlLink Nashvillestandup.com , a mock news feed featuring the aforementioned Joe Southards, and an "anti-drug" PSA, concieved by Damian Anaya, who was also my editing partner for that bit. I will try to get the commerical and the PSA online soon so my adoring fan can fawn over it. The show itself was solid and I recieved great responses on my material. Once again many thanks go out to Matt Sterling, for the projector and screen and many bloody l
