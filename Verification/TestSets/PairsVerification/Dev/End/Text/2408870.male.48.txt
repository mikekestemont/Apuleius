The High Court in a 4-3 finding upheld the Federal Governments right to indefinitely detain failed asylum seekers that have no other place to go. While this decision related to two asylum seekers, stateless Palestinian Ahmed al-Kateb and Iraqi Abbas al Khafaji, there are 13 other asylum seekers who may be affected by this decision.  This ruling overturns previous Federal court rulings which determined that the governments indefinate detention of people who had nowhere to go was illegal. Now these asylum seekers must rely on the mercy of the federal government or hope that a kinder nation (such as New Zealand) will accept them.   urlLink Ken Parish  at Troppo Armadillo has a good analysis of this decision and points out that the reasoning of the majority judges in the case of Palestinian was a little bizzare;   it must be accepted in the present appeal that, as the primary judge found, "there is no real likelihood or prospect of [the appellant's] removal in the reasonably foreseeable future", but that does not mean it will never occur. Whether and when it occurs depends largely, if not entirely, upon not only the course of events in the Middle East (his preferred destination being Gaza) but also upon the willingness of other countries to receive stateless Palestinians.    urlLink Troppo Armadillo  via  urlLink Barista
As the Olympic juggernaut is about to overwhelm us, here is an amusing account of the  urlLink 1904 St Louis Summer olympics . The Marathon was a particular balls up with the initial winner being disqualified for hitching a lift. The eventual winner was a Thomas Hicks (pictured above) who finished the race in some distress:   It seems that Hicks had begged to lie down about ten miles from the finish line. Instead, his trainers gave him an oral dose of strychnine sulfate mixed into raw egg white to keep him going. This was not enough - they had to give him several more doses, as well as brandy, along the way. By the end of the race, Hicks had to actually be supported by two of his trainers so that he could cross the finish line (essentially, he was carried over the line with his feet moving back-and-forth). Hicks was very close to death's door. It took four doctor's to get him in good enough shape just to leave the grounds, eventually falling asleep on a trolley.   The accounts of other competitors in the Marathon such as the the Cuban Postman and the first two black Africans to compete in the olympics are worth reading. via  urlLink Black T
