my day had past - my cup of coffee, and a text message from Marie. This guy and his political stances on issues are a point of frustration for me. He will defend to the death that he is an "independent" voter, but every stance he takes, every joke he makes, is from the liberal viewpoint. I cannot comprehend why he refuses to admit what he is, why he's so afraid - more on that later. He continues with his story that this commercial is a blackeye on the Whitehouse and that there some republicans that are upset with the ad, etc. So I ask why it's a blackeye, and he promptly steps on his soap box - I think he's on his 5th or 6th because he uses them so much that he has worn them out - and proceeds to explain how you do not attempt to dishonor what a person did when he was serving his country, because he was defending his country and our rights, blah blah blah. I made the counterpoint that Kerry invited this critique of his service in Vietnam when he made it the centerpiece of his election bid, citing it as an example of his leadership abilities and why he would make a great leader as President. He replied that there were several fellow servicemen who support his bid, and I informed him that there are several  hundred  that condemn him - all supported with signed and dated depositions. Also that it was a completely independent add - in creation and funding, claiming no allegiance to the republican party. So, again, why is a critique of the reason why a candidate proclaims himself to be a capable leader a blackeye on the Whitehouse? I wish I could describe the lost look in his eyes, like a deer caught in headlights. Unfortunately it lasted only a second and he reverted to his holier then thou attitude, condemning the add, claiming it is just as wrong as when the democrats where trying to smear President Bush's well documented service record in the Air National Guard. Funny, as how I can remember wise crack on top of wise crack about how President Bush was born with a silver spon in his mouth and how dad got him out of serving, etc. Weird how stories change when the tables are turned?  Mission Statement:  Later in the day I realized that I hear this smear rhetoric everyday, and everyday it is allowed to pass without a response. This not only comes from John, but from other coworkers, friends and people I meet in everyday life. Unfortunately I feel that a majority of the population only sees one side of the issues of the day. This blog - whatever the hell that is - will be my place to attempt to deliver a different point of view to those who only hear that one side. And whatever the heck I feel like writing in addition to that.  Updates will come as soon as I can write them...check back o
