ang pagtawa during AP time because of Sir Guinto's jokes. Kanina ko lang napansin ang happiness ng mga tao sa mukha nila. Talagang nung Monday at medyo nung Tuesday, ang lungkot ng mga tao. Tapos ngayon, makikita mo sa mga mukha nila at sa mga ngiti na abot langit ang tuwa nila, at kasama na ko dun, having Sir Guinto around.     I know it was only "God's plan" and part of life that, that happened to us. But at least we've learned a lesson not to take someone for granted.   Memories...  It's nice to bring back all the memories. Even though we had some tears or sadness in the past, its nice to remember all these and see what it has done to us now in the present.  Just like the one I said, after the tears and anger we had before, now I can see some discipline and LOTS of happiness and laughter in their faces.  Ang saya tingnan ng mga tao  after  all that  happened .      **Sorry for bringing back that topic...Ãœ**
I'll Never Get Over You (Getting Over Me)   Selena    I hear you're taking the town again havin' a good time with all your good time friends i don't think that you think of me you're on your own now, and i'm alone and free i know that i should get on with my life but a life lived without you could never be right  chorus: as long as the stars shine down from the heavens long as the rivers run to the sea i'll never get over you gettin' over me  i try to smile so the hurt won't show tell everybody i was glad to see you go but the tears just won't go away loneliness found me, looks like it's here to stay i know that i oughta find someone new but all i find is myself always thinkin' of you  chorus  oh, no matter what i do spending a lifetime to live through i can't go on like this i need your touch you're the only one i've ever loved  chorus i'll never get over you gettin' over i'll never get over you gettin' over me
Pansinin Mo Naman Ako     Pansinin mo naman ako, Konting pagtingin ang hinihingi sa'yo. Pansinin mo naman ako, Puso ko'y litong lito, Kung pag-ibig nga'y totoo. Pansinin mo naman ako, Hirap na hirap damdaming para sa'yo. Pansinin mo naman ako, Kung pwede lang sanang itigil ko na ito. Pansinin mo naman ako, Nakatingin lagi sa tulad mo, Ikaw lagi ang hanap ng pusong ito. Pansinin mo naman ako, Iyon lang ang hinihiling ko, Pansinin mo naman ako, Pansinin mo naman ang pag-ibig na alay sa'yo...  Sigh.
Life is full of surprises.  You'll never know that what's happening to you now will be part of it.  One day, we need to make a decision, a right one.  But when we chose the wrong decision, we will regret it for the rest of our lives!  We would want to go back in time and change that past.  But no one can do that n
