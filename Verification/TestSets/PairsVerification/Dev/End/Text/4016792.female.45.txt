red wine and John Coltrane.
OK, so I should stop playing with the html and actually post something, right? So much self-discipline required, I'm not sure I'm up to whole blog thing. Friday night, thank god. A weekend stretches before me filled with fabulous possibilities....must climb out of the work clothes and go find something fun to do. Scheduled all my days off for the rest of the year. Lots of long weekends and a week in December. A little traumatic for me, and for Chris, who made me promise to available by cell phone, but I feel so freeee now, and can't wait the two weeks until my first couple of days of down time. In the middle of the week!
Happy anniversary, Kitty and Mike.    urlLink        You are probably finding the baby day counter obnoxious, but eventually you may find it adorable. Or tolerable. Or not. My blog. Get used to it.  Enjoy the sun in Santa Del Whatever. I am planning a few long weekends myself, as difficult as it is for me to take off from work. You never know what might happen in my absence. They may find that they can get along without me. So I have 15 days still to take before the end of the year or I lose them. Haven't taken a day off yet this year. I am either the best employee EVER, or out of my mind. Very certain that both are true. So I am forcing myself to schedule 10 days off during August, September, October, and then the week before Christmas. I heard American Airlines has $199 fares between New York and LA if booked this week. Must look into.  Anyway, I'm thinking a spa day is in order. I desperately need a massage. A loooooong massage. I feel like the stress of the last 45 years is knotted into my neck.  By the way, in case anyone is wondering, Kathleen is the best friend in the world. Talking sense when I needed it. Thanks.  Oh, and I never did find anyone to go to the movies with Sunday night, because (rant) everyone I know is lazy and boring. It's the movies, for chrissakes, not like a huge commitment, you sit in the dark for 2 hours, how can you not "be up" for that??  So I went myself and saw I Robot. Perfectly acceptable sci-fi stuff, but I would have liked to have seen the robot's character more fully developed. I seem to remember more depth in the novel. Must reread. Come with me next time, or miss once again my insightful and witty commentary.
What a week. Survived the preparation of our new branch location for a visit by the Vice President of North American operations, car trouble part 3, and I don't know what else. Now I have to do my laundry so I can do it all over again starting tomorrow morning, and find someone to go to the movies with because goddammit I am going to have a little fun this weekend. Time is running o
