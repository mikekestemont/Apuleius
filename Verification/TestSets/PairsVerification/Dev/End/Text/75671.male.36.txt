urlLink evhead: Now in Blogger: WYSIWYG  But it doesn't seem to work correctly with my backspace key in Firefox. Might take some time to debug...  Update: To fix the strange backspace  behavior you have to  disable the "find as you type"-feature in Firefox.
Feel like i am running in circles...

I was quite astonished to see, that entourage now works with digital signatures, just as  urlLink mail has done since panther . I can now encrypt or sign email via the S/MIME security standard. The procedure is nearly the  urlLink same as with Apple Mail . Once the keys are in you keychain, you can select them in the security tab of the account settings. Nice...
If you are a mac-fan and not able to afford photoshop etc. just go and grab  urlLink Gimp-app . It will fullfil most of your graphic needs. You will need X11, which is on the installation cds from Panther and which i think is installed by default.  urlLink Gimp  is no Apple conform application, but it is very powerfull. Just go and play with it. It is very expandable and has some powerfull scripting in it, so if you are not far from the command line you should be able to create amazing things. And the best news is: Its free!!!.....

One thing is for sure. THIS SUMMER SUCKS BAD. It's not that i love the sun or the summer, but this year seems to be the worst i have ever seen in germany. We have had rain, rain and again lots of rain. The construction workers at our site (we are building a house) were soaked for most of juli. Our one week vacation on mallorca it rained and right now i am sitting on my balcony and guess what... yes it rains. OT: Went to the movies (what else can you do?) and saw shrek II which was nice...
Its great to have an anonymous blog. I have had a blog for the last 5 years that everybody and their darling knew about and that made it hard to even post. This is not to say that i wil continue posting frequently, but that it is just more fun to do it without anybody knowing. Had a great night with a good friend and am going to bed now. sleep w
