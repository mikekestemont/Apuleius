"WOW! thank you! that's the best headline i've ever heard since 't-mac traded to houston, editors too distraught to make anti-bush propaganda.' i'm so happy! wait a minute..."  "fine fine, i was just playing witchoo, knaamean cheeleecheezhawtdawg?" i knew those ebonics classes would save my life someday.
