about the whole situation.  I tell you BC is looking like a very good option right now. That's for sure.  We'll see.  One day at a time...one day at a time...  going to lay down....rough day!!   peace and a teardrop today  Kat
Interesting day.  I got a phone call this morning from all people.  G.  Said he wanted to talk to me for five minutes.  Nothing bad just needed to see me.  I said what can you possibly say that you haven't told me already.  He pleaded. I caved and said sure.  He came up looking like he always does all wrinkley and rough looking.  Said he hasn't been able to sleep and he really needed to see me to apologize for everything.  He still doesn't think what I'm doing is fair to him but said he knows that I'm going through with it and wants me to know that he just can't accept this right now but perhaps once the baby is born he will want to take an active part in the kids life.  Wanted to make sure that I knew it was over between the two of us and that he has moved on and wished me luck.  Don't know why he had to come over to tell me this but he did.  I didn't feel anything when he was here. No tears. No anger. Nothing.  I am still feeling numb about the whole situation and I can't feel extatic that I am actually finally going to have a baby.  I'm felling very fat and bloated and I'm only weeks not even months into this pregnancy.  Can't wait to find out how far long I am.  I fell liked I'm three months already..lol  I was going to go downtown to the bookstore but ended up stopping at the mall, did some shopping, and came back home.  I'm on a puzzle kick right now.  Spent my whole night doing one and finished this morning so bought a couple more at the mall and have been working them all day and watching movies.  Didn't even realize what time it was.  Oh well no work tomorrow it's a holiday. Whippeeteeedoo.  I'm not even excited about the long weekend.  I have to be sick.   Oh well other then that I talked with Nellie and my brother today but all else seems to be quite.   I truly hope that G does want to play an active roll in this childs life.  He also said today that he would help me anyway possible.  As far as him and I being over.  I still have mixed feelings about the whole thing.  I'm still angry inside for him making me believe that he's been in love with me just to find out that he hasn't loved me for sometime.  And on top of that he's seeing some other girl.  I need to make sure I just concentrate on myself and baby right now.  Fuck men!!  Anyways going back to my bed to watch tv and do my puzzles.  Most likely will need a nap soon.   peace  K
