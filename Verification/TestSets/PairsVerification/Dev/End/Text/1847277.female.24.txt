of them because I was stuck in Montenegro (happy late bday Jerrywill- see, I'm only a month and a couple weeks late), and I guess I owe Mike a much less late but still belated happy birthday, too! Let's just celebrate everyone's birthdays on one day.  Like a second Christmas, but preferably during the summer.
Happy frickin' birthday to me.  That's right.  Feel lousy if you forgot, cause here I am in Israel all alone with my bones, and I only got birthday wishes from one person in the whole world.   (okay, I'm bitter cause I'm a huge birthday person and spending bdays alone in various countries away from family/friends stinks, and I know that there's an 8 hour time difference and maybe tomorrow when I check my email I'll have birthday wishes in my inbox, but still...)
The new blog template: good or bad?  A little more flashy.  And no more links.  I found out that now you can post pictures to your blog if you download a specific program, and I'll be all about that once I get home.  Yay for making the blog more exciting.  And, if you didn't notice, now you can also add comments.  Not that anyone has comments, but, well, if you do, feel free.  But if they're nasty I'll delete them. :)  So, I haven't tried to be deep or meaningful on my blog in a long, long time.  That needs to be remedied.  Today I was actually reflecting on the past year (I had to fill out a yearly progress report for my NSF fellowship), and I realized how much I've grown up since last year at this time.

In terms of academics, personal life, everything.  I finally am starting to figure out what I want to do with myself academically, I passed prelims, I have new friends (including girls!), I've done lots and lots of traveling, etc.  And of course there was the drinking until I puked thing.  Lots and lots of lessons learned. So, at the end of the day, do I feel like I'm a better person?  Well, maybe not, but I think I now have the potential to be a better person.   And you can take that as you will.  :)
I'm back and badder than ever.  Righto.  So, after a month in Africa and a 36 hour voyage home, I've actually already left Ann Arbor again.  Now I'm embarking upon a 2.5 week journey in which Matt and I will be driving something like 4000 miles.  Okay, maybe not quite that many, but close.  But I'll see my family, my friends, and my cat, and I'll be with Matt, so it should be worth it.    Anyhoo, Kenya was really good.  I got along with Stan, I have lots of ideas about dissertation projects, etc.     And I don't feel like typing in my b
