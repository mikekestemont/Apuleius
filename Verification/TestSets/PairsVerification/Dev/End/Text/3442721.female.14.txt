him. he always let his kids (Alex, val, and tato *mikey*) get away with murder but when me or my brother did something wrong like letting our lights on we did something only the devils children did. Do you see why i hate him??? He was cruel to my brother brett since he was little. That is what made brett creul. you know what they say, bite the dog and the dog will learn to bite back. I wanted him out of the house before my mom even sugested it! Any boob can be a parent but only a select few can be fathers. And he was not a father! He is gone now! YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Okay i think you get it. but now there is another man in the house. He is Sam. He is the only man that i would ever consider a father. He is kind and understands. For the short time i've known him he has been the nicest adult male that i've met. I see my mom and she is actully happy. I guess somebody is missing out cause sams ex must have been insane. Sam is a sweetie to my mom and i love it. If he lets me i'd start calling him dad. So mom if your reading this i love you and thank you for finding a sufficent father! oh and here is  urlLink my mommy's blog  read it she'd like it
Okay i met the stupidest people today! they were wearing all pink, said crudy crap like, "OMG!" "Gag me with a spoon!" and "what ever!" I wanted to tear their judgement heads off and play soccor with them. They called me gothic and a grunge. 1) I am a punk not a goth! 2)grunge my left foot i clean myself daily well on the weekends it's every 2 days so no shower on saturday.... but they judged me before they even tried to get to know me. Oh well why they are dating head football players and sleeping around and ending up on the streets like the football players will, I will be happy as an Emt and i'll probally marry someone in ems as well. Right now i'm happier than the majority of people cause i am excepting a lesson. the lesson is that you shouldn't care about what everbody thinks.
I have to go to Findlay's rib off tonight. Then for the next 2 daysI have gusmaker duty. Yeah fun. Any how. I find myself going back each week for more learning. Wow... I love going to explorers though. We had team building and i think we are all a little closer... Except Justin... Don't ask why but ever since i met him I felt a bad vibe. I really don't know why... Anyhoo. I am really bored and I have nothing to do.... So I'm gonna sit here at my comp till it's time to leave
