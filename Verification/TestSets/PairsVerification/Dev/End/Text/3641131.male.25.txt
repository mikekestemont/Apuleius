Both videos are great, and they both occupy the hazy space between the artists' real life and their stage personas; The stars get to have fun by toying with their own tabloid mythology - because the artists themselves are the ones exploiting their own personal relationships they're able to create a confessional that is entertaining because it promises a thrilling glimpse of their real lives; but you don't know what, if any, of it is real, and what's just self-parody or flat-out fiction.
I just saw Jonathan Demme's remake of The Manchurian Candidate. The  urlLink 1962 John Frankenheimer original * is one of my favorite movies, so I was dreading having to sit through a dumbed-down, actioned-up 'modern' version, but I was pleasantly surprised by it. For once it seemed like the remake was warranted, trading in cold war paranoia for endless-war-on-terror/corrupt-corporate-lackey-president fears. And Meryl Streep was great in the evil mother role, although she seemed more inspired by Hillary Clinton (and the simmering rage of my sister Condi) than by Angela Lansbury's awesome performance in the original. I really dug the remake because it seemed (to me, at least) to have a simple and effective message that would make it fit right in as part of a double feature with Fahrenheit 911: do we really need to worry about an evil company trying to control our country by brainwashing our president? The answer: Of course not! The president we have right now doesn't need a brainwashing and barely has a brain worth washing anyway- he and his whole cabal already answer to their corrupt corporate benefactors. (The movie even had some nice subtle digs on Haliburtonish corporations profiting off of unnecessary militarism and adding insult to injury by overcharging our taxpayers for their services - and also tamperable touch-screen voting booths!)  -Happy August ( Rabbit, Rabbit ) -- Ava Q.

President John F. Kennedy, as a favor to his friend Frank Sinatra (star of the film), called Krim to let him know that he had no objection to a film version being made.     After John F. Kennedy's assassination in 1963, the film was pulled from circulation by owner Frank Sinatra, who was concerned that some would draw parallels between Lee Harvey Oswald and the film's brainwashed assassin. (He had also heard a rumor that Oswald saw the film before killing Kennedy.) After nearly 25 years, Sinatra relented and allowed a re-release in 1987.
