living in a high-rise in Birmingham.  That's The Streets.  And while buying this record left me feeling gritty and urban, I kidded myself that invention was the intention and it's retention comprehension.  Because that's probably a decent rap in Harrow or perhaps Milton Keynes. What I'm trying to say is that this album was way outside my normal purchasing demographic.  Normally, I walk smugly along the neat hedgerows and net curtains of the "safe" options that have already achieved legendary status, or the quirky pavement cafes of artists that you know won't attract passing trade (and therefore attention).  But I went to the bad side of town to buy this record.  Metaphorically.  In reality, I got it from an online retailer so didn't really go anywhere.  But for someone as un-versed in the ways of rap and urban music as I, this was a trip to the badlands.  I did not wish to assume the mantle of chav amongst my peers, but a performance by the Streets on the Jonathan Ross show could only be described as electrifying.  From my scant knowledge of such music, it seems to burst and flow with the unrefined energy that renders it so essential in the eyes of impressionable young'uns like our chum in the picture. Comparing The Streets with the chav phenomenon is lazy and unimaginative, but the similarities are there.  The diction, the themes, the little details, the pre-occupation with nightclubs, drugs and booze.  The slight whine and staccato rhythm of the vocals is another indicator, and the pulsing beat almost forces you to strut in that exaggerated chav way.  But to give them their due, the album is thought-provoking, relevant and exhilerating in the way that the chav is not.  Whilst your average street-chav can only hope to be a garish characature of someone with something worthwhile to say, The Streets write the manifesto for a movement which prides itself on being largely directionless.  To be a chav is less to strive for something, but to avoid being a host of other things from what I can tell.  It makes punk look well-informed and refined.  Take the energy, the hope, the reason for fighting or making a noise out of punk, and you have Blairpunk, or the chav phenomenon.  A social cult based on a bland and unstimulating society.  Where they all have just enough money to afford that new spoiler for the Fiesta or that new Sovereign ring, just enough to get smashed in a bus shelter with some girls with big earrings.  There's nothing heroic about the chav, and in many ways, there's nothing heroic about the downright grotty world in which The Streets live, rolling spliffs in front of the Bill, hanging around in nightclubs for people who don't turn up, taking drugs through boredom, the droning confrontational chat-up patter, hanging around in queues, trying to phone your mum.  It's not exactly Dr Zhivago.  But it's real.  And for an uncompromising truth, and an uncompromising document of our time, this is hard to beat.  And occasionally hard to b
