Well, haven't updated much but since I'm kindna bore at work right now, so I think I should keep you guys ( the ppl who read my blog, THANK YOU alot ah) up to date with my dog adopting adventure. I'm lucky that my dad is still pretty excited into finding a dog. He's looking for a Pug though. Anyway, alot of people are helping me to find a dog to adopt ga. So one of my coworker send me a site and there's pug in it ah! so excited la, I went and call them. They said they have to do an assestment to the owner sin wor!  So ok, they fax me a form na and after I read the form, it's scare me.  Heres' the questions that's very scary ah! 1. Do u think it's odd to let your animal sleep with you?  YES la 2. Do you think it's odd to let your animal kiss you? This is ok wor, but no touge law 3. Do you think it's odd to bath with your animal? This one is NASTY!!!!! NO NO NO >_ 4. If you are married in the future and your spouse don't like, will u give up the animal? YES! la, if my wife pick a dog over me, then i think she LOVE bathing w/ the dog...  5. Do you think that we are offensive in asking these questions? mmmmm, YES.   I know what they wanted to said, it's that "YOU SO NEED TO CARE ABT THE DOG!!!", but asking these questions really scare me. So I'm back into step 1, checking out SPAC to see if they have any doggy. Hey, if you have a doggy that needs to adapt, contact me wor! Here's what I'm looking for. A small size dog, don't care if it's puppy or adult, don't care if mixed or pure. ( I like mixed cos they are special!) but have to be small size. PUG size will be good ga. Oh, No Pomeranian.  Thanks l
