right colors, clean up the focus, touch up blemishes, etc. With a digital photo it takes only a minute or two to adjust color, brightness & contrast, focus, and etc. In fact in most cases adjustments aren't even needed. Man was I thrilled. It was oen of the best purchases I ever made (and at the time I didn't know a baby was in my future - an event which causes an exponential increase in photos taken.   This is getting long and it's not clear if anyone ever reads these :-) so I'll wrap up with my steps in printing a photo. I always use Raw mode on the Canon. It takes up more room (but I use 128MB cards so I don't care) but produces far superior results. First I import the photo(s) to a import folder on my laptop and then fire up Photoshop and use it's Browser to see all the newly imported photos. I open one up, do a save as into the destination folder using the Photoshop format, do a page setup to prepare it for the photo paper, try the Auto Color feature to see if that looks better (if not I undo), then do a Unsharpen to improve the apparent focus. Then I'm done and I queue up the photo for printing.    Probably everyone but a luddite or newbie has already made the conversion to digital. But in case you haven't I completely recommend it.

Second, they tend to squander their income (neither works) and always ask for favors at the end of the month. Such as buying cigarattes for them and them not paying for them. But all of these pale in comparison to the bad influence they represent for my daughter and even my wife. This is a very difficult situation to discuss of course. All the above added together means a lot of likely damage to our marriage relationship should they move down here. This is something I don't think my wife comprehends but will require discussion. I'll be made out to be cold hearted and hear "why don't you like my parents" but it is a discussion that must take place. I made a commitment when we decided to have children and I won't tolerate a costly and negative influence hurting her future if it can be a
