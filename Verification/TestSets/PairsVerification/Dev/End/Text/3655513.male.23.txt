2 brand new computers for professors at the university/college I work at last night, upgraded the machine my Jenny's brother owns and am about to repair my roomates machine.  No profit or anything, just something nice to do for the people in my life, so they can save a few bucks.  Keeps me out of trouble I suppose too. *laugh* Besides, I will enjoy the look on their faces when they see their new computers. People generally like new toys and gizmos, so this should give them all something to be happy about at the very least.  Church tonight and tomorrow morning. Singing my heart out as usual. Then tomorrow is a special day for Jenny and I. 6 months since we mutually expressed our feelings and desires to move beyond plutonic friendship. *smile* Jenny is excited. That REALLY makes me happy. I love her so much some days it hurts.  Lots more going on really, but I don't feel too expressive right now. Meh.  Shalom.  Rooster
So after a 6 day haitus I'm back and find that I don't necessarily have a lot to say, though what I will say should be worth your reading.  I spent the weekend out west, and that was more than satisfying. The town of Summerland in the Okanogan Valley was hot and tourist filled, as I personally discovered. Good times on the lake, and too much food (thanks to my hosts) made for an enjoyed visit, if not rushed.  Coming back to the booming metropolis of Calgary, I found the temperature 15 degrees lower, and that I felt rushed and harried in all aspects of my life. Needed to get this done, had to work on this, have this coming up, etc.  With impending deadlines and pressures building, I've found myself neglecting some of my more standardized daily disciplines, and have set today as a starting point to reorder my time and get those disciplines back on track.  I have been occupied by worry a little as of late too, which is odd for me, as I am definately not a worry-wort. I have a friend in Mississauga who is trying to get her life together, and while I offer her all the encouragement and help I can, I worry for her and the outcome of her efforts.  I have another friend who has had a tough couple of years (in the previous 2) and is returning to school this coming september. I worry for her, and pray for her, but am feeling more and more unsettled about her situation as time goes on.  Finally I worry about myself. I worry that one day I won't live up to all the things I need to. That I won't be there for the people who depend on me, or I won't be able to give all that I need to, or come up with the finances I must find time and time again, etc.  I guess I'm just a little short on peace lately. If you have a little to spare, drop me a line.  R
