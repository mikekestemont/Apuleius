mathematics and subjects and homework and revision.. just to perfect the daily schedule and to maintain it.. rather happy about things now =)
gosh. i realised that for the past weeK I've just been slacking with less then a hundred days to Os and less than fifty days to prelims.. i actually am&nbsp;wasting precious time. not much progress since the last entry just that e math syllabus for sec three is done. sounds great but took a great deal of time too.. lagger..  stayed at home today instead of going to school since school is all about revision and quite a waste of time esp tuesdays. so im back to work again. hopefully more progress today...
Well, been absent for two school days.. Loads of catching up to do. Physics.. Ms So seems to have to revise all topics with the class on request by us. So I guess time spent on each chapter wont be a lot and I'll have to do my own revision before she does it with the class so that I can ask questions... A math, I'm lagging behind. Gotta catch up. Everyone's at chapter 6 while I cant figure out chapter 5 yet. Oh well, gotta see how it goes tomorrow.. So I guess I cant do much of revision today yet. Just have to do math and read through Germany. Slept too much this afternoon. Gotta make up of the lost time adious
Well, let's see what I have done so far in this term ehz      History -&nbsp; Russia    Elementary Mathematics - Secondary Three syllabus Chapters 1 to half of 10    Additional Mathematics - Logarithms (according to the handy guide)    Geography - Weather &amp; Climate, Natural Vegetation    Chemistry -&nbsp; QA except tests for Halogens with Organic Solvents     Not a lot at all for three weeks.. But I've been slacking a lot. Hmm, gotta buck up? LoL. hopefully. I want to work hard but dont want to burn myself out before the O monster comes too. Aye, gotta strike the balance then.     Then, on a lighter note, lets see what is that I dont need to study..  english..what else.. actually need..but only the format for situational writings only=)
Well, I come online so often that I think I spend more time Online than burrying my heads in the mountain of books.  So I decided that being online, I should also think about what I have studied so far ehz.  This Blogs just for the tracking my revision progress. Hah sounds silly but aye, beats being at the table doing homework right?
