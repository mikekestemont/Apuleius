ecstatic but somehow our prayers didn't work . Hahah the banner that was suppose to drop when we pull it , somehow it didn't ... and things were messed up . But you can't blame us , inexperience teens! Oh then this one very memorable Dikir Barat performance we did during Teacher's Day .. boy i'll never imagine myself sitting down with those malay batik thingey tied over my body and singing those Dikir while doing actions! Hahah .. but we all enjoyed it in the end .. especially those tune of Pink Panther and Gong Xi Fa Chai and Jingle Bells! Then the never-ending smile i had to give when comes to prize giving . Every Monday is Sookie's and my day preparing the darn meja hadiah and yeah ... presenting prizes to my principal to give them away ... we've always said "yaya who cares bout the hadiah if it's nice or not , it's not ours anyway .." i'll always miss that .. and oh gosh during those big big ocassion where prize giving is concerned , man i'll never miss that! Hahahha the amount of time we spent arranging those certs and prizes and throphies to give away .. eeeuu .. but then again that's my job . And especially those times i spent with Sookie , those memorable times we worked together as partners and a team in PlanCo , i'll always miss them! Hmm somehow i dunno if it was planned , but i just wanna thank whoever who put us together to work coz we worked really well! I'll miss your jokes , i'll miss your laughters , i'll miss your sarcasm , i'll miss our conversation during Jalur Gemilang being sung , and i'll miss all ur help when we're together Sookie!
Emm finally i could get online after sooo many frustrating days from Saturday night til like yesterday night! Just got into my nerves how MBF work things out . So slow just to transfer the money into my Jaring account . Anyway , just a thought for you to ponder . I was just wondering the other day why humans are so easily agitated (maybe it's just me!) when things don't work out the way they want it to be . Even small little things like not the proper attire , not the right food , not the right timing .. etc etc . Hmm ... no wonder God says people are never satisfied . That's why we need Jesus! Ok in other way maybe God sees i haven't been studying much since the past few days .. that's why He decided to suspend my internet for me to study! Anyway , i'm on mc today ... started with the minor soar throat last thurs and now things got worse . Had flu and a little bit of low fever last night . So better rest at home . Sigh health hasn't been nice to me lately . *cough cough*  To everyone out there , eat ur vitamins and take care !
