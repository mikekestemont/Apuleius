nothing much to do except glimpse marine life and swim and sail. If you do that for all your life... You get my point. But blissfully unknowing to the big world out there, these people are happy. I both pity and envy them. All except one. This fellow speaks exemplary English and the menus and boards around that part of the island are probably his work. He's clearly educated and perhaps he realises the small lives of his friends. Speaking in German (dumme kuh over and over again to my brothers, that means stupid cow), I wonder if he misunderstood (for he definitely heard) that he couldn't understand the language anymore and that the educated world was slipping away from him. A misspelt word on one of the boards perhaps reinforces my belief. Can't help feeling sorry for him. I would feel the same in his situation.  But one thing that challenges my perception of their lives is the coral. So beautiful it is that perhaps life is worth living there after all. And snorkelling enhances its beauty, although my poor snorkelling skills could have diminished my enjoyment. Able to stare underwater for more than a minute makes it unreal, more like Underwater World than anything else, that's how clear the water is. And watching the fishes swarm around you trying to get to that piece of bread you're holding is wonderful too. The sand, real unlike Sentosa, soft like a carpet beneath your feet. And the sound of the waves at night crashing unto the beach and the clear clear night sky with its stars... You should pop over there some time. Idyllic is the word.
Today I passed Dunearn Secondary on the way home from lunch. So? What's the significance, you might ask.   ... I was in Choa Chu Kang. The problem is, since the school has shifted its premises, their name is no longer valid. I remember reading somewhere that someone was calling for the schools to change their names to something more appropriate. Needless to say, they didn't, or I wouldn't be writing this now. How could the MOE not realise this idiocy? Ah well, the mysteries of life and the government. Anyway, no one seems to care anymore until a bumbling CHS student comes along and brings it up, namely me.
ACE POINTS  Heck, my ACE is in a complete mess. I don't think I've maxed out for anything yet and the most I've got is somewhere around 8-10 for IH (I think). I have only myself to blame for my predicament. From next year I have to manage my time better what with ACE, MRP, Project's Day, CRP, CIP and so on all co-existing on the same sphere... However, there's still time left for me to hand up a few last assignments, like this one. So am rushing out this despite not being an active blogger. Thus far I have been suffering from writer's block. The sabbaticals also hold the key to maxing out. I should go for either Science or Chinese ones. maybe also for M
