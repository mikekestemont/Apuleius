security men called in to break up a fight, sex between two contestants and producers setting "evil" tasks.  Jason - who entered the house in a thong in May - received boos from some fans on leaving but said he was "chuffed to bits" to come second. He said it was "brilliant", adding: "It's made me a better person so I've enjoyed it." Daniel, a hairdresser, insisted he did not want to win the show. He told viewers: "It's not something I would've been comfortable with. It's not hard work in the house." On leaving in fourth place, Shell, a student, said: "People just kicked me up the backside a bit and I had good fun from it."  Popularity Nadia received almost 3.9 million votes in the final week, compared with 1.3 million for Jason. Daniel got 685,995, with 347,051 for Shell. The total of 6.4 million was up from last year's record low of 4.3 million votes - but still lower than the totals for the first three series.  That makes it the second most popular of the UK's five series, behind Big Brother 3, which saw Kate Lawler triumph.     The only thing I can say about Nadia winning?   I'll leave it to Austin to comment:   .      That ain't no woman! It's a man, man!

Well I've put off doing this for long enough, it's now time for my first post.  Hmm, what shall I write about to make people think "wow this is an amazingly interesting read"? I think if I spent the next ten years trying to write this post no-one would ever think that!  The idea of putting this blog together was really just somewhere to put my random thoughts about my life in general. I'm currently living in Northumberland, which is in the north-east of England. It's near Scotland and in general in rains a lot. Job wise it's a bit poor up here so within the next month I hope to be moving south to Hertfordshire, which is about 30 minutes outside London.  If you're not to sure about the area, here's a map :-) I'm currently living near Newcastle and should be moving just outside of London.(about 300 miles away)   I've decide it's time to move as I've been stuck in a dead-end internet job since I graduated in Jul 2003 and I think it's time for a change! I've sent off a bunch of application forms, so now it's time to play the waiting game. It's not a necessity that I a find a job before I move but it would be nice.  I must admit I'm slightly nervous about the whole moving to a totally different area, leaving all my friends and the familiar locations but sometimes I think you just need to make a change.I did previously live in Hertfordshire about 5 years ago, so I have a rough idea of the area and know people there, so it's not a totally new environment but still.....  Only time will tell I g
