was seriously needed. During this week I heard word that my beloved Nana had passed. My Nana is one of the funniest, spirited ladies I have ever known in my life and she lives on in the hearts of many of my family members and friends. It was a difficult and stressful time for many close relatives which was so difficult to watch from afar. My Nana is very much missed, but I am so thankful she has found a peaceful place.  Carter and I made the journey to Georgia pretty effortlessly....but we did manage to see toll booth takers kissing on our way to the airport. I'm so glad that there are added benefits to that job. I had a blast visiting with my parents, my sister, and her two adorable kids while managing to hit all the thrift shops in the area. The beach was also great. You can actually get into the water and not freeze. Leaving Carter at my parents for the extra week wasn't nearly as hard this year. Most likely because I wasn't coming home to an empty house and because Carter loves spending time with his grandparents. Besides he looks forward to this trip all year long. He had an excellent time. He is still talking about Sea World and the many trips to the beach. He is already talking about next summer's trip.  The trip home from Georgia for me was uneventful. The next day Josh and I loaded all of my things into the moving truck. Not to my surprise, all of my junk fills the 25 foot truck....and I had gotten rid of my bed and my futon. Of course the next morning.....it's raining. Apparently this is part of the curse of Josh. According to Josh's parents he is notorious for moving in the rain. So I must say it was an experience I've had and I don't think I'd like to endure again. To our surprise.....the previous tenants have not moved all of their things out of the house nor is the house clean. Josh rants about the window sills being dirty.....but I found hair in the freezer, dirty finger prints all over the kitchen wall, and empty wine bottles throughout the house. Which I think explains why things were just left. Everything was just utterly filthy and I'm not exactly Miss clean. I made Josh complain to the landlord and he sent his cleaning lady. My mother nor I have ever had a cleaning lady....so to come home to a house that has been cleaned.....was just amazing.  So....Josh and I have been living together for 2 weeks at this point. We had a lot of fun and things are going well. We love this apartment (I'll throw up pics soon!) and its location. It's great. Carter absolutely adores his backyard. He has never had a backyard before, and I must say the kid truly appreciates this space. We have settled in pretty well and now we are now getting to know Newton. 23 days to savor before school b
