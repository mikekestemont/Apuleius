valium, I just ate some findus crispy pancakes and chips. Starting to feel a bit wobbly and staggery, but mor at ease and sleepy. Depression is such a bizarre condition in how it comes and goes. At least the new pills are helping, making it easier for me to talk to talk to people and get things done.  The cats are driving me mad again, both Gizmo and Tabitha have been jumping all over me as I try to type, gizmo went and sat on the broken picture on top of the book case. Had to get her down, as the glass is still in it, stupid cat. I love them really, their my babies, but they get on your nerves when you're trying to type!
Well I put in my claim for incapacity and income support today, so that should be all ok soon. Getting drunk on some White Port I stole from my dads house  earlier, its nice, but strong! Must remember not to drink too much! am chatting with the Korova guys at the moment, they're a great bunch, I'm so lucky to have found them.
The message boards are all dead, everyone must be out enjoying the heat I suppose. Shame I hate the heat isn't it! Thomasina's disappeared too, I know Levy's off at her drama camp thing, so she's probably gone to see her there. Natch is offline until he gets his phones on, but at least he'll have a proper PC! It will be good to be able web cam with him, if he ever gets one. In real life things are ticking along, i'm going on the sick, must go to the doctors tomorrow, and get a sick note. That will make things easier for me for a while, things have been getting me down recently, I've had a hard time. everything fell apart again. But I'm doing OK really, I went to a great gig yesterday and got wasted! A Jimi Hendrix and Beatles Tribute group! And I met a charming woman on the same anti-depressants as me, and we compared side effects. Both of us agreed they are the best we've tried, but the problems with achieving orgasm were annoying! They are helping me keep positive, and with recent events I'd be in bits now without them.  God Bless SSRI's!
There, now my profile photo is of me and Nigel kennedy. It's difficult to tell which one of us is more wasted from that picture!
BOLLOCKS! Well you can see them both here:  urlLink http://www.novogate.com/board/5547/   If anyones reading this.
It was all a bit mad, saw David Byrne, and met Nigel Kennedy, and got 2 photo's of him! ">.  This is my favourite one, superb! I was smiling for days over that. Absolutely the last person I expected to meet. And he was totally out of his face! So was I for that matter, well, it was a festival! Met some cool people, everyone is so friendly at WOMAD, it's delightful really.  Hope the pic works, I'm not used to doing it on here, fingers c
