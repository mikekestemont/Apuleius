give schools back their sports or arts programs or build up places for young people to go, like parks with tennis courts, basketball courts, a clean public pool. The possibilities for the good use this amount of money is endless. Yet these candidates need the money for television commercials, and for traveling around the country is big wonderful buses that probably cost hundred of thousands of dollars. They spend millions on their campaigns. And if there are two or more of them raising this kind of money...That's a lot of money! Their using this money to smooze for who knows for what? Pay that TV corporation millions for an ad, so that all the executives in that TV corporation get their $100,000.00 bonuses. I hear these candidates complain of an exhausting schedule. Yes I'm sure it's an exhausting schedule. But wouldn't you be more exhausted scrubbing someone else's house for $5.45 per hour, because you've graduated from high school but still can't read. Or waiting tables all day and hoping you make enough tips to cover the rent, let alone save for college. Don't you think you'd really be exhausted then. We really know how to squander money in this here USA, from the government on down. I hope one day to inherit one of those $54.99 (per) screw(s) the government paid for military use, put I won't ever pay that price unless I have a screw loose.  We need to quit squandering our resources and our money. We really need to buckle down and work on making this nation and world a better place. We really need look at our government and make improvements. This nation is a great nation, but that doesn't mean we don't need improvement.

My Dad is been suffering from depression and heart problems and has been hospitalized a few months ago. My Mom had a very large lump in her breast at the beginning of the year. Luckily it was a fibriod tumor only. But she is having problems with her kidneys. My nephew broke his finger badly and had pins inserted. My cousin had a hernia operation, she's still recovering. My 94 yr. old grandmothers health is starting to fail and her 94 yr. old boyfriend had severe pneumonia. There are lesser problems with family members... We are all doing fairly well dispite all the stuff that's been going o
