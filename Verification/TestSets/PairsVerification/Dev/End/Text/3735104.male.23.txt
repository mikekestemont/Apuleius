Dear All,      Linda has generously given us permission to reproduce her Assignment One, which John and I both thought was outstanding.

If ethnicity is nothing but a term used to differentiate people, is the body also a basis of differentiation?  If so, then Werner Sollors’ thesis that everyone is ethnic becomes problematic.  The reason being is that according to Franz Fanon’s essay, “The Fact of Blackness,” the body, particularly the black body, is the site of alienation.  Hence, if the body is indeed an ethnic factor, then the usage of ethnicity has negative connotations.  In other words, when looking at the term ethnicity, one cannot ignore that it means to describe the “Other.”  However, because Sollors asserts in “Who is Ethnic,” that ethnicity is a universalist term that includes dominant groups, he underemphasizes the negativity that is associated in the usage of ethnicity.    	To Sollors’ credit, his investigation on the historiography of ethnicity does highlight how ethnicity is often used to mean “nonstandard.”  He mentions that even by the mid-nineteenth century, when ethnicity was finally defined as a person’s particular race or nation, the word was still only used to point out a person’s difference to the dominant group (Reader, 130).  With the acknowledgement that use of ethnicity often coincides with discrimination, race, manifested by the body, must be included as an ethnic factor.  Fanon explains the experience of being trapped in a body that is racialized.  He states, “In the white world the man of color encounters difficulties in the development of his bodily schema…A slow composition of my self as a body in the middle of a spatial and temporal world—such seems to be the schema.  It does not impose itself on me; it is, rather, a definitive structuring of the self and of the world-definitive because it creates a real dialectic between my body and the world…” (Reader, 95).  Ethnicity is the dialogue that differentiates the “Other” from the dominant and the racial body is the feature that places a person into the category of the “Other.”  Since the colored body is registered as different to the white world, race, as an aspect of ethnicity, is negatively viewed. 	The understanding that ethnicity has negative connotations is lost though when Sollors argues that dominant groups are also ethnic.  One reason that he gives for his argument is that ethnic studies have emerged from the Afro-American Civil Rights Movement and that “an omission of the Afro-American tradition in a discussion of ethnic culture in America would create a serious gap in our reflections” (Reader, 131).  This statement is problematic because as we have learned from Fanon, African-Americans are not part of the dominant culture.  In fact, their colored bodies make them ethnic because they are different from the preferred majority (whites).  By absorbing African-Americans into the dominant group, Sollors removes the injury that comes from being e
