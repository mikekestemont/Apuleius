free beer and food, and so me and Kat can hob-nob with TV executives.    Word.
Sorry about all the (Edited for Content) stuff in the previous post, but there were some things that seemed public in the deep of night, and more private in the harsh light of day.  So if you want to know more about it, talk to me.  And I just might tell you what the deal is.
If I'm glad for nothing else in this life, I'm glad that I have the ability to appreciate irony, and find it amusing.  Many things have been afoot since my last post, so I hope that you will excuse me for my absence, gentle reader.  In no particular order, here's life as it stands...  I have mono.  I have started (Edited for Content).  My car started unhappily smoking today.  I've (Edited for Content).  I won at poker.  In general, it's been a pretty tumultous two weeks since my last post.  I've been pretty busy, and I've had a lot of fun.  Unfortunately, I've also been pretty tired, and my throat has been hurting like the dickens.  Luckily, it's starting to feel better today, and I've been less feverish.

Dad seems to think it was the A/C that gave out, but I'll call in the morning to see what the damage is.  I guess it's a good thing I've been saving up.  I've (Edited for Content), so that's a problem.  I won at poker!  This is four times out of eight poker nights.  I don't understand, but I like winning, and I like fellowship, and I kinda like the money.  So woo-hoo!  We had a really great turn-out for the poker night, it being the first co-ed one.  And I ate some really good ribs.  So there's me in a bloody great nutshell for right now, just to recap.  I've missed lots of bits and pieces, moments frozen in the amber of my mind, but I just don't have the endurance to put them down right now.  And I would be relying too much on the attention and endurance of my readers as well, all four of you.  :)  So suffice to say, life is good, God is great, despite the road b
