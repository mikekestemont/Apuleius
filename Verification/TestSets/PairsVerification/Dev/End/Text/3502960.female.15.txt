you as this potter has done to his clay? As the clay is in the potter's hand, so are you in my hand. 7If I announce that a certain nation or kingdom is to be uprooted, torn down, and destroyed, 8but then that nation renounces its evil ways, I will not destroy it as I had planned. 9And if I announce that I will build up and plant a certain nation or kingdom, making it strong and great, 10but then that nation turns to evil and refuses to obey me, I will not bless that nation as I had said I would. 11"Therefore, Jeremiah, go and warn all Judah and Jerusalem. Say to them, `This is what the LORD says: I am planning disaster against you instead of good. So turn from your evil ways, each of you, and do what is right.' " 12But they replied,  "Don't waste your breath. We will continue to live as we want to, following our own evil desires."     God is the potter, and we are the clay. I'm going to lift this off Ps Palan's message to my youth on saturday :)  We are clay in God's hands. Does the clay tell the potter what shape to mold it into? No, the potter molds the clay exactly as He pleases. The potter knows what shape is best for the clay to be made into, because He knows the texture and type of clay and everything. Sometimes we tell the potter "Make me into this, or make me into that!" If the clay bothers the potter like that, it will only prolong the process.  God is like the potter in the passage. If we are marred, He will squash us up, and start again. A vessel/pot/vase is never made perfect in the first round of molding. The potter has to mold the clay, remove the flecks of dust and small little rocks, squash the clay, and start all over again. Each time, the shape will be better than the last. It's the same with us, really. It's a painful process, being squished and remolded, but in the end it's all worth it.  Here in this passage God also gives us a warning: The way we live can change His mind about the plans that He has in store for us.  Of course God has great plans for you. Of course He wants you to be beautiful like Jesus, and have good success and everything. But we can make God angry, and the worst thing that can happen to any Christian is have God turn away from us.  God is merciful, and He gives us chances. But there's a limit to everything. The best the clay can do is  be still  and let God do the painful squishing process.   (v11) 'This is what the LORD says: I am planning disaster against you instead of good. So turn from your evil ways, each of you, and do what is right.' "   Signing off, Jenna p.s. sorry about missing the Friday's post; I couldn't access the net (
