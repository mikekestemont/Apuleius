well today was a pretty good day i guess, besides the fact that i was half dead from waking up at 8 0'clock this morning. the seniors took all the freshman and that to go order our sneakers. there pretty nice, white jordans, $79, not too bad for jordans. after we ordered them we went to american eagle and a few other places then we went to red robin for lunch. that was good. when i came home i was bored, thats nothin new. then i went for a ride wit noelle and then we went to her house. which pretty much consisted of jeremy yellin at me to walk on his abck and when im walking outta the house, him grabbing my leg and not letting me leave. ahahha. im hopefully doing somethin tomorrow night. i hope ill see roman and lauren cuz their both leaving for the shore saturday :(( im gonna miss them. well i guess my night is pretty much coming to a close. so im goin to say goodnight. write later.   -tHe WoRsT Is OvEr nOw, &amp; We CaN BrEaThE aGaIn-   - seether ft. amy lee ~ broken   iLuRoman       - molly
