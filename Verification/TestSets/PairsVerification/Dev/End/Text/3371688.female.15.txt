his chin so i could kiss him very softly. and we had sex. it hurt, but i didn't bleed, and i felt good. it felt amazing. i heard that girls feel self concious and vulnerable right after they have sex with someone and try to hide their bodies, but we just kissed for a little while, and i got up to put my clothes on while sam watched me. it was 1:17 according to my watch. "are you leaving already?" he asked? "remember, i told my brother i was going to meet him back at the hotel at 2."  "right...but its only 1:20." i smiled, "well i expected you to walk with me for a while, to make sure no one hurts me." now he smiled. "i don't want anyone to hurt you." he put his clothes on and we walked out with no worries.  we didn't talk very much as we walked around, but a few key things were said. "you know i'm leaving tomorrow." "i'm aware. are you going to call me?" "i don't know." "so you don't want to stay in contact with me" he didn't say this very upset, actually. just like a fact. "would it matter if we did keep talking? we're not going to meet again. and you are, so fully amazing, it wouldn't work. i'd meet someone back home, or you would, and we'd just be more attached." "oh you don't get attached after sex? supposedly losing your virginity. virgins bleed." he said all this in the most acusatory tone, however. "hey, you don't want to accuse me of lying. you know i didn't lie. and you know i wouldn't have slept with you if i didn't feel something for you. i just want to be with you, right now. and not think about what's happening." he paused. and we walked. a few minutes later, he sighed, and then responded, "you are right, about everything. that's what i want too." we didn't talk again until we reached my hotel and saw my brother standing in the lobby. we kissed for about 2 mintues then i stopped. "i'm not going to forget you, you know."  "i know." then he left. that was it.   the rest of the vacation went by, and i had a good time. a great time actually. but i thought of sam. i kept thinking about him. and that, folks, is about when i changed. at least all my relationships. before when i met a guy, i would flirt to no end. i could talk to any guy i wanted at a concert, or at a store, or walking downtown, but once i got to know him, it all changed. i suddenly couldn't continue to act like a girlfriend. but now, that 2 day period of not actually knowing a guy, could last for as long as i wanted it to.    okay, so this is all made up, but i want to write a short story and this is the first part of it. don't be surprised when i put more u
