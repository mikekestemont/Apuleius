leave?" The answer, "all of it!"  What we do here in this life for God will be stored up in heaven waiting for us if we are saved, amd we are not to love this world or the things of this world. If we love the world, the Bible says, "The love of God is not in us."  That nice house, that sporty car, that money in the bank, you are going to leave it, so lay up treasure in heaven by serving and worshiping Jesus.

I don't think God wants you to be homely and not have anything of value in your name, that's stupid.  I don't think your life should be focused around these materials...but it's not a sin to want to own a sporty car, have money in the bank, or live in a nice house.  Marion Jones I disagree with you...I bet you're poor and just want to make yourself feel better.  With Love.  Tyler -1  Public  -0
It's looking like I will be a Schley County Wildcat soon.  I went to school at ASS and it was a typical day; overly dramatic, uptight people walking too slow for me.    Then I went to Schley.  I like the school.  It's clean and not confusing...only one story.  They freaked when they heard that I could build websites...it seems that no one knows how to there...sad really.  I met the head tech guy and he agreed to let me work with him 2nd block so that's cool.  Then 4th block I'd be in journalism and since I've already taken it once...so that shouldn't be such a big deal.    The only thing I am going to miss at my old school is Lit. class.  I like Literature a lot.  I think that that was the one class in my entire 7 that I felt like going to.  The people were nice in there and I will definitely be keeping in touch with them.  I don't know for sure when I start but I will definitely let all of you know.    Fare the Well.
As you may or may not know, I have been contemplating the idea of switching schools to Schley County. The idea was originally my parent's, but I guess it grew on me after the months went by. So tomorrow I have to go at 1pm and sit and talk to with counselor's at Schley. Schley is supposed to be a good school but I just have too many friends to leave behind. I would and could still see them, but not as often as I'd like to.       I just farted.      Anyways, tomorrow I will take what happens until 1 at ASS (Americus-Sumter School for you non-knowers) and then take how much I liked Schley, and deliberate. These next two years are important and I really want to get everything out of high school I hand for college. I just hope their Technology Labs are actually u
