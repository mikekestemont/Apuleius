with one of the Big 4.  I'm torn between just wanting to finish school and start working and gaining valuable experience and contacts.    I'm traveling home this weekend.  I will actually be in BR a lot in the next two weeks because of my Dad.  Give me a call if any of you will be in town also.
As  urlLink Claire  mentioned, the Baloonfest is in Baton Rouge this weekend.  I spent a great deal of time sitting on the tailgate of my dad's truck watching the balloons float by our house.  The first 50 or so that we saw were a little distance away.  Close enough to make out the designs on them (like the tooth and the partridges), but not close enough to  actually see the people inside.  After a while, it didn't look like anymore were coming so we went in and ate mom's saturday morning biscuits.  As mom and I were doing the dishes, we heard one of the balloons outside.  We rushed outside to see two balloons hovering just feet above our house!  We were shocked that they managed to clear the oak tree we have in our front yard.  As one of them passed over our neighbors house, we heard the guy say "Good Morning" to our neighbors in their backyard.  One of the balloons landed in the empty lot behind their house.   After that, Renee' and I jumped into her car and tracked down the rest of the balloons landing on the levee.  I'll post pictures soon, I just need to find the cord to download them onto my computer (I hate moving).
Movies have been a big part of my entertainment this summer and I've seen pretty much everything out there.  I haven't really been in the mood for movies that will make me cry, so I haven't seen The Notebook and since I'm not a huge Will Ferrell fan, I haven't seen Anchorman.  Other than that, there's not much that I've missed.  I've discovered a theater in Mobile with stadium seating that plays movies that have been out for a while.  I'm not entirely sure how the place stays in business since I'm normally the only one in the theater for whatever movie I'm watching.  I finally saw The Day After Tomorrow a couple of nights ago.  While the plot is a bit impossible, I enjoyed the movie.  The theater had a hand in making it more realisitic by keeping the a/c set at sub-zero temps and I walked out of the theater expecting blizzard conditions to have taken over south Alabama.  I was happy to see that if an ice age would suddenly develop, Louisiana would be ok other than all those cajuns trading in their 4 wheelers and cajun reeboks for snowmobiles and ice-shoes.  They'd probably really enjoy getting new breeds of animals to shoot at.  Can you imagine the smoked meat festival with fried moose?
"Virgo: You'll finally break the endlessly mounting tension at work when you cause the rollback of that aggravating 'days without an accident' sign."  This worries me.
