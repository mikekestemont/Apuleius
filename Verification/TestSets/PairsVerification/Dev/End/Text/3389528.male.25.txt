explain.  I've seen some BIG mice in my day.  Two years ago in cabin 48 (oldest boys) we spent our session trying to outwit and outsmart what is now referred to as "Mighty Mouse." He was quick.  He was strong.  And it's been rumored that he could, yes, fly.  Anyway, the mouse last night gave birth to Mighty Mouse.     I digress.  I see the mouse and instantly shout, "Get to the other side of the cabin!  Quick!"  The only time I've seen 11 yr. old boys move that fast was when someone accidentally dropped a box full of Hershey bars all over the ground on the way to Gimme Shop.  While they huddled together in the corner, my CIT and I attempted to sweep the mouse out the door with a broom.  Let me now remind you that we were waiting outside the bathroom door for someone to come out.  Sammy was in the bathroom going number two this entire time.  Mind you this all happened within seconds.  So as I am swinging this broom around like a madman I am thinking the entire time, "Please God, don't let the mouse go into the bathroom."   Why was I thinking that?  Sammy, while managing to maintain a witty composure on the outside, is actually quite the mama's boy.  I doubt the boy has ever seen a mouse that isn't behind glass at Petco, much less any other animal.     Wouldn't you know it?  The mouse could read my mind.  He was in my head and knew what I was thinking.  So of course he went straight for the bathroom.  All I heard from behind the locked bathroom door were the screams of a terrified little girl, coming from an 11 yr. old boy.  I could barely contain myself.  It was by far the funniest moment of my summer.
God is great.  God is good.  Let us thank Him for The Village.  So yeah.  Session 1 is over and we are now counting down the session until Elenie arrives.  But on a lighter note, the session rocked and my campers were awesome.  They will be truly missed.  I did get a little emotional seeing them go.  No tears, but plenty of emotions.   I bought 2 new books last night.  This makes me very happy.  Um.  Okay I'm not so inspired today.  Just kind of chilling.  Peace.
