at night isn't safe makes total sense. i'm really good at blocking out common sense though. i love to sleep with windows open. i love fresh air and cool breezes. so sometimes i win this argument. sometimes i don't. on tuesday night i decided i wanted to sleep with the windows open. i was really excited because i didn't have to argue with john about it. so i throw the window open and pull the curtain back slightly so i can feel the breeze. i'm laying in bed loving the breeze and i suddenly hear a strange noise outside. well, that's all it took. john won the argument and he wasn't even there. i freaked myself out being home alone with the window open. i jumped up, closed the window and turned on the air conditioner much to my cat's dismay.   last night i had to run a couple of errands. i got home, put away the rest of my laundry and sat on my bed staring at the tv. i knew i should read or do something less mind-numbing than watching tv but i had no energy. then i wanted to cry. i don't know why. sometimes i just get overwhelmed when i start thinking about a lot of things at once. things like: will i ever have money to buy a house? when will we start a family? what do i really want to do as a career? is john going to finish his m.div on time? it's ridiculous and i really need to stop obsessing. but so far i haven't mastered that. so i finished that episode by going to bed at 10 o'clock. (early for me) did i say i'm really ready for john to come home?
there's all this new fancy stuff to type with on blogger! fun!  interesting article on gluttony:  urlLink http://www.relevantmagazine.com/article.php?sid=4278   i'm getting really tired of people in general assuming christians have to be right-winged conservatives. it's in the media. "oh you're a  christian, " with just  that  tone. then they go on to say how since you're republican, or since you're like g.w. it's tiring.  or those other christians you associate with (i'm not talking close friends here) who think that you are not a good christian because you're not republican. show me in the bible where it tells what my political stance should be! sure, it gives me guidelines and there are obvious things that i have to take into consideration when voting and/or choosing a political party. but nowhere does it say that i have to support big business. and like jim wallis said at the emergent convention "god bless america is not in the bible"  stepping off my soapbox now...  tse cancelled a show on august 20th. we were supposed to play at border's in the north hills, instead i'm going to see over the rhine ( urlLink http://www.overtherhine.com ) at club cafe. yay!  oh and my brother and his new(ish) wife priscilla are coming to visit on august 24th, then i leave for vacation on august 29th. yay a
