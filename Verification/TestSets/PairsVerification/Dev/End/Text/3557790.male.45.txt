style, with jins extending above the top of the foliage. My desire after he gave it to me was to A) reduce the rootball for a shallower pot (this one) since his grafted roots had grown so well, 2) give the tree a more natural elm appearance with upper branches reaching for the sky, and III) change the planting angle so the "parent" trunk is not dominated by the "child."  &nbsp;   &nbsp;  I removed the massive lower roots and base of the trunk two years ago, placing the tree in this imtermediate pot. The incorrect planting position is entirely my fault and largely due to the root placement around the tree. Following is a side view.     &nbsp;  I wired the branches upward last year and allowed the tree to grow. Around July 14, I defoliated the tree and wired it completely, with the results you see. The new planting angle should be something like this:     I have given a lot of movement to the branches with the idea that they will grow and the bases of the branches will set. Then I will cut back hard and start again. I have used some of the old original branches, most of which are inappropriate in that they are long and straight and cannot be bent. In future, I hope to graft all new branches on this tree. Also, the top of the parent trunk is a large chunk of deadwood. It had previously been a large, pointed jin. My plan is to carve this deeply to make a hollow trunk effect and thus make this tree look far more natural.   Since I have finished this work (and worked the bugs out of my html), the tree is responding well with new leaves. I will be offering some photos of its development as the year progresses.    Update 07/29/04    The tree is responding well and sending out a wealth of new leaves. The next two photos show the tree about one week and two weeks after the work, respectively.           Soon I will cut back hard to force more back budding, leaving a few long shoots for grafting next spring.   Chris
Here it is, the last week in July in the heartland. We expect to feel more like Texas than San Francisco, but it's been rainy and in the 50's for the last couple of days! I am thinking that perhaps the trees may not slow down their growth so much this year. Typically at this time of year, we must be careful to avoid overwatering because the trees actually use less water, but at the same time avoid overheating of the root systems. But this summer has been so spectacular, lawns are green and growing fast, flowers are still abloom, and I can wear a suit to work once in a while!  As soon as the weather warms up a bit, I will be repotting the tropicals. A few of these are ficus of various quality and age, but one is an older fukien tea. I hope to chronicle the process here on the b
