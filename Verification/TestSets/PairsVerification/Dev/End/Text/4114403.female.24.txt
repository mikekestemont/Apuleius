was I...and dammit, we were in love. In April, we got engaged, and then...in June...I was pregnant. Good-bye life. Hello parenthood.    Of course, Jonathan stuck by me through it all. He married me and made a semi-honest women out of me. And, through him, I learned that sometimes you just have to grow up. Sometimes, the things we want have to be put aside because there are bigger fish to fry. And so, I became Gini-mom and wife, instead of Gini-the brilliant journalist.       The last five years have quickly passed me by as I've sat and felt bad for myself. My son has grown and my marriage has somehow flourished. It took a long time to discover who I am and what I want to do. Baby steps...that's all I can say.       I'm now writing a successful political blog...a rediscovered passion!   I'm in the midst of planning a political website that will be full of my writings and my opinions. And, hopefully, before too long, I'll be where I want to be. But, in order to be happy later....I'm going to have to work to be happy now.       And, I am. I've pissed away so many opportunities in my life. And, here I am...still reaping benefits AND punishments for those choices. But, I cannot abandon my life now. Because I never want to look back upon this moment and feel sorrow or regret.
I'm so stressed today....  There's too much to think about. Too much to take care of.  Jonathan makes me angry. I know it's not his fault...but it seems that he leaves everything up to me to handle. I know he does it because he trusts me to do it right, and keep everything in order. But, when you handle it all on your own, it's easier to be hard on yourself when you fuck up.  My blog on Xanga is doing well....but I'm getting burnt out. Am I really making a difference? Am I really changing minds about this election? I feel like I have nothing original to give anymore. But, I have so many readers, and they expect it out of me.  My MSN groups are piling up. Some places I don't feel like I fit in. Some places I fit in too well. Women are so petty. Why is it that we can't just work to get a long? Someone is always trying to tell you how to parent your child. You're a bad mom if you do this...or if you don't do that. It's clique-ish sometimes....and I hate knowing that I'm a member of that clique.  Andrew gets his stitches out tomorrow. It's been a week, and I still feel like a horrible mom. I know it was an accident...he was just playing too rough in the house....but the looks people give you when they see that bandage on his head...it makes you feel like crap.  I'm hoping whatever depression it is I'm in will fade soon. I want to feel useful and happy again. I want to stop sleeping so much and being so c
