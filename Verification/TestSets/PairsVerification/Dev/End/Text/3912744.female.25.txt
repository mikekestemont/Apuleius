emotions amongst my fellow reviewees and friends.  The thought of another Sunday was torturous at the least.  And when the re-take’s cancellation was finally announced the day after what was supposedly our last exam, we felt even more sorry for ourselves, having been deprived of the traditional “salubong” at Taft Avenue.       Acceptance.  I never really arrived at this stage, which means that up until the results came out, I was just one big nervous wreck.  While during the review, I found it hard to sleep at night with constant “I have to study some more” thoughts bugging me constantly—during the long wait for the results, these were replaced with “Did I answer number 1 correctly? Number 2, 3??? Oh no!!! What was the question again???!!!”  I call it “Bar Psychosis” – an offshoot of the enormous stress and anxiety that every single examinee goes through for four months of studying, taking the exams for four Sundays of one whole month, and waiting for the results for another six.   Worse, the Bar Exam is probably the most hyped up and publicized among all licensure exams in this country.  I have it on good authority that results in other countries are mailed individually, and never publicized and celebrated by the media.  Really, it should not be such a big deal!  This way, examinees can actually be relieved of loads of additional pressure.   After all, a number of famous people, even the best, have taken the road to “take two.”  Claro M. Recto, for one.   And in foreign shores, the late JFK, Jr. (“take three” in his case), Hillary Clinton, Gerry Spence.  I could go on and on.  I am one of the lucky ones who made it on my first try, but I do not see the reason why others should be crucified for making it on their second, third, fourth, nth tries.  A friend once told me that the Bar is a personal journey and success is not measured just by the results but by what values you've learned and what memories you've gathered.  Indeed, I can honestly say that it was one of the biggest challenges I've ever had to overcome in my life, what with all the highs and lows.  To say it was difficult would be an understatement.  Grueling, perhaps, would be a much better term. I remember having read tons of “bar preparation” materials back then.  I remember all those pointers about number of readings, what books to use, the struggles I was about to face, etc.  But all of this notwithstanding, I will never forget the memorable experiences that no handout or manual prepared me for  -- from scouring the city for 24-hour cafes, to indulging in last-minute "in denial" drinking sprees and feeling guilty immediately thereafter, to waking up in the middle of the night with my face plastered on a book, to praying to every Saint I know, and finally, to steadying my trembling hands moments before an exam and looking at everyone else in the room, knowing I am not alone in my f
