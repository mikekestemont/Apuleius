Ethernet card with a card that probably doesn't have enough in the bank to cover it.  Yay, I get to go to the bank twice this week.  I make it home without running over any grandmothers that really shouldn't be driving because they read the Speed Limit Sign : 22 instead of 55.  I immediately start dinner, it's 5:00 PM now and dinner is at 6:00 PM.  Spaghetti - something not stressful, yeah right.  Tim wants to go ahead and install the Ethernet card to make sure that the DSL works and I try to explain to him that it doesn't matter at this point if it doesn't work because it is now after hours.  He doesn't care and I have to begin installation of this Ethernet card with Nicholas on my titty, food cooking on the stove, Isaac needing help with getting his pants up and Tim up my ass.  It didn't go well.  So I call technical support and select #1 for English and I get some foreigner that doesn't speak English and shame on me but I said, "listen Gook, get me someone that speaks English, NOW."  I know, I know and it is so unlike me.  Needless to say, someone that spoke perfect English couldn't help me so I told them how worthless they were and hung up.  The Modem... Once again, I'm on the phone with Sprint, explaining the problem with the Network Adapter and for once, I get someone that speaks English, knows what he is doing and is obviously trained to handle women that are on the verge of killing someone.  Flawless and in minutes, he gets my network problem solved, my modem installed and me online.  The nighttime thing... Dinner was good but I couldn't enjoy it due to my lovely husband smacking.  I swear he was swallowing it whole.  Sick bastard.  Isaac wouldn't eat because he saw a mushroom in the spaghetti.  Nicholas was an angel but getting exhausted quick and he was on the verge of biting my nipple off.  After dinner, I clear the plates and get the boys in the bath.  Isaac can tell that I'm about to explode and he tried to help me as much as he can but he ended up in the way.  He gets a gold star tomorrow for effort.  Nicholas loved his bath, we were both soaking wet.  Tim is absorbed in his western and offers no help.  Where did my wonderful hubby go?  Now... The kids are in the bed, asleep.  Tim is on the couch, still watching westerns - through his eye lids.  I am so pissed that I can barely smoke without biting the filter off.  This day was an absolute nightmare and I'm so pumped that I couldn't possibly go to sleep.  I can't find other blogs : the happy ones will piss me off more, the pissy ones will set this bitchfest in deeper and the sad ones make me wanna slap the owner and say, "HEY, that's fucking life, deal with it!"  ~~dealing with it (barely)  E
