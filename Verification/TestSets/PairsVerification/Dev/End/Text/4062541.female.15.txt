to watch out, Arik was leading me into the trap again, eh, its possible.  Ross was like your my best friend, and I was like and your mine, nuttin will change that.  I was torn, who to trust, I mean they both have this special place in my heart, but I know that either of them could be right, but I doubt both can be right.  I was torn and confused, so I went to the source for help, I asked God.  I sat and talked about everything, and I came to a conclussion,  my friendship w/ Arik is impossible.  It could never be a real friendship cuz we can only talk on the net, never really hang out or see each other cuz we all know who wouldnt like that.  He tries to say it is different, I delt w/ it for a year w/ Ross, I know its not any different.  No one knows better then me, sorry Arik, you cant just change how she feels about things specially when it comes to me.  I cried for so long, I didnt want to face that its the only way.  When I stoped I thought of things I could do, block him, get rid of some things and just not deal w/ him, till it was time that maybe we could be friends.  Well, this morning I woke up an hour before I was suppost to, I had time to think.  I realized I could never really block Arik out, I mean its impossible, his my friend, I realized that w/ all the shit we have put each other through, his still my friends, maybe not as good as before, but I cant just walk away f/ that friendship, all the hard work we put into maken it work, I just cant quiet.  I know its still seems impossible, eh, something I hate, I hate to be confided to talkin only through the computer to one of my best friends, wouldnt you?  I mean to know you can see each other every month but no you cant talk or hang out or goof off cuz there is that imaginary wall blocking it.  I have alwayz hated it when someone told me I could not hang out w/ someone, I would stop at nuttin to prove them wrong.  I did that w/ Ross, only after we become close, but that was easy.  This time its not just Tara I have to deal w/ its also Ross.  I know Ross would never tell me, no you cant hang w/ that person, he wouldnt stop me, thats what I love, he never tells me what I cant or can do, never passes judgement, he warn me plenty of times but thats it.  *sigh*  I cant do this, I cant struggle w/ this, I give all power to Arik, he makes the atempt to hang and be my friend then I'll do the same, but he has all power now, cuz I suck w/ the power and it just drains everything out of m
