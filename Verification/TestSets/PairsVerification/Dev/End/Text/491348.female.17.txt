dog. And I knew what was happening to me even while it was happening.  At first I tried to stop myself. But I couldn't. It was a compulsion, and obsession. Irresistible. After a while I gave up caring how I behaved or who thought what about me. Trying to hide how I felt was too much strain, and I wasn't succeeding anyway. I was just making a fool of myself. So I let it show, let it happen. I felt easier straightaway. More natural. More in charge of myself. If that was the way I was, I told myself, why pretend anything different?
I had a GREAT time yesterday.  ♥
OK I've edited this entry so many times I don't even know what to write anymore.  It was originally about my craziness over QI LI XIANG - THERE. I'm proud to be not ashamed of this. Or ashamed to be proud of that. Whatever.
They didn't want me linking the files from  urlLink Jay-Chou.net , so I removed the links.  But anyway I got all the tracks now.  To download, go to  urlLink solid07 , so I won't be hot-linking again.:  urlLink go here .  And the official tracklist is supposed to be (I've removed the translations that I don't agree with, and slightly changed them.): 01 我的地盤 (Wo De Di Pan / My Territory) 02 七里香 (Qi Li Xiang / Orange Jasmine) 03 藉口 (Jie Kou / Excuse) 04 外婆 (Wai Po / Grandmother) 05 將軍 (Jiang Jun / The General) 06 擱淺 (Ge Qian / Stranded) 07 亂舞春秋 (Luan Wu Chun Qiu) 08 困獸之鬥 (Kun Shou Zhi Dou / Duel of the Trapped Beasts) 09 園遊會 (Yuan You Hui / Garden Tour Fete) 10 止戰之殤 (Zhi Zhan Zhi Shang / The Youth That Ends War)  My computer's fixed, and it's much better, I must say.
It amazes me how some Chinese people can believe in these fortune-tellers (算命師) so much. Like, they believe every single word.  This one fortune-teller told my best friend that if she has beef/steak, she'll have bad luck. So all her life she hasn't had any steak or beef or any cow-related food. (Well maybe once or twice.) That's just missing out on the nice food.  My other friend (who is a very good violinist,) heard from a fortune-teller that if she goes to Europe, not only will she have get a major illness, she'll also fail to get her degree, and end up broke. So now she's not going to even think about going to Europe to study music.  It pisses me off, sometimes, these fortune-tellers. I mean yeah, I know they have no other life skill and probably need this to make money to live... But what they're doing... it's like ruining other people's lives. My friend here could be a very good violinist. And now, if she stays in Taiwan all her life... I doubt she'll get anywhere.  Oh, and she changed her name, too.
