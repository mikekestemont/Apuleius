have a crush :) He knows carey gould though, and is standing up for mike blacks wedding on the 3rd. So hell definatly be at the bar on the 3rd! yay!!! So after the bar, Jen decided to go back to scullys, and dave and I went to bp to wait for larry, and to get something to eat. We walked to his house and he showed me his pool, which i was excitede about, as i want to go swimming lots this year and he gave me a ride home and a kiss!! :):) But stupid me didnt give him my phone number, although he technically has it, as he phoned my cell for me so that i could find it in my purse. Well see, but he definatly seems like a great guy, so heres hoping ill see more of him. Oh yeah, and were almost for surely moving to Durum Place, Aug 1st, Im excited!! So this weekend Im painting up a storm. and maybe going to celebrate my new job, by going for supper or something!
Well, my birthday bash at Houston's didnt goat all how I planned... Jen was too sick from partying Friday night that she had to go and get her stomach pumped, so she didnt come, Amy didnt show up, Jeff and Jay were being fuckers, Gavin didnt show, Cam and Reece showed up but were too fucked to doanything but sit there, and they didnt show up until 1, and then there was Dave... He came in, I went over said hi, introduced Marnie, and then he was like Ill see you later, and took off. Not impressed at being blown off by him, considering how he treated me everyothertime we were together. Fuck him. I think he took Chera back to his hotel room and screwed her, so screw him. As part of Jens apology for fucking up my bday plans, she is going to bitch him out. So all said, I had the shittiest bday ever. Friday night was ok though. I decided to go over to Scully's. Aaron phoned Dave to come over, which he did. He hung out with me all night and we made out quite a bit. We all went to the decker, then went back to scullys. so scary guys showed up, guys that dave was calling pedophiles, and they creeped me out cause they were watching me dance and trying to dance with me. ick. dave and i left at 430 and he took me home, because he had mikes wedding. jen phoned me at 9 in the morning - at which time she was fine - whatever- telling me that scully and his brother dave got into a fist fight and the cops came and threw them in the drunk tank. scullys are cut up and jamies bruised from trying to break it up. so im glad that we werent there, cause dave hubbard probably wouldve tried to fight dave horkey before his brother. so that was my weekend. jobs going good... more l
