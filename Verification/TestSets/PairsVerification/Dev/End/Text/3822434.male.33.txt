requires listening, and translation skills, and patience. That's probably why we do so little of it.
I'm alternating between expecting that no one else will ever read this (in which case it will exist to be my storage place for items of personal interest) and wanting to give some basic information to anyone who does stumble in here.  So, in the hope of the latter option...  I am the sole pastor of a Christian congregation in the west suburbs of Chicago, Illinois.  This congregation is an older one, both in terms of its history and its current demographic.  My hope for this congregation is that we will grow in our ability to interact with the communities in which we find ourselves.  I don't know if anyone from my congregation will ever read this blog, but I hope that it will serve that goal in some sense whether they do or not.    There are two types of communities which I have in mind for our congregation to relate to more fully:  We are in this western suburb, and the nature of the community around us is changing (amusingly enough, it seems to have been making two distinct changes - there seem to be both more wealthy people in our community, and more recent immigrants from Europe - and we don't seem to be connecting with either group).  I'm firmly convinced that if the church isn't being a part of the social fabric, it's not entirely being.    At the same time, we have a theological community which we are a part of, but we've not related to it for many years, as it went off in directions we don't appreciate.  Now, our address is still in this neighborhood of the American Christian Community, but we don't know anyone on our block, and we don't really know the people on other blocks all that well either.    If you haven't already figured this out, I'm not an isolationist.  I don't really think that the people here are isolationists, either, so I'm trusting that they will be interested in learning new ways to be principled participants in our communities instead of just backing out of them.  And that's what I'll be doing here, more or less.  I hope you find it useful, and i hope that if you have something to add which will improve it, you will.
If you are reading this, I hope that it will ultimately prove useful, thoughtful, and helpful.  I do not know how regularly I will update this blog, but the purpose of Pilgrim Life is to make note of things which I think are significant for those Christians who understand this life to be a pilgrimage.  Or, at least, I expect that they will be things I think are significant.  I don't expect it to be political, nor do I expect it to be bubble-pricking.  I hope that what finds its way here is constructive more often than destructive, and I hope that what gets built here is a view of the world which oozes with the hope of the r
