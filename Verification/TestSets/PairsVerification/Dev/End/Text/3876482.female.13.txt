It's freezing in here.&nbsp; I hate being cold, I want a blanket.&nbsp; No one reads this.&nbsp; Hmm, ok.&nbsp; Anyway, I love my music.&nbsp; Ben Folds is a cool guy, so was George Harrison.&nbsp; Paul McCartney is  not  dead.&nbsp; Frank Sinatra and Louis Armstrong have amazing voices.&nbsp; So does Jamie Cullum.&nbsp; Katie gets a gold star for liking Buddy Holly.&nbsp; I really want the Cure's new CD, it's supposed to be a lot like their old stuff.&nbsp; You can't beat their old stuff.&nbsp; I love the Smiths.
"Here Today" is officially the saddest song in the world.&nbsp; Paul McCartney wrote it for John Lennon after he died.&nbsp; It's definitely one of the most heart-felt songs I've heard.&nbsp; It's beautiful, I cry during it every time.
I have 2 versions of I want you to Want me.  It's an effing amazing song.    Now I have 3 versions.  One makes me want to cry, then throw something.  No Doubt covered I want you to Want me.  I've heard their other stuff, and it isn't bad, but this cover is pretty awful.  I was sad.  Simple Plan also covered a cheap trick song.  Another amazing song that was fcked up.  Damn
Hiiii!  I have another blog, woop woop!  I think that Katie has me beat though.  ;D  I'm at the office.  I haven't eaten yet today, eeeep!  I'm going to fall over.  *falls* I'm good.  Did you know that Yesterday was Ringo Starr's Birthday.  I never made him a cake. ;(  I'll do that this weekend.   Happy Birthday Mr. Starr!
Gah, I can't talk to my mom about anything anymore and it's driving me nuts.  I really hate this.  I want to start taking guitar somewhere else.  Scott is cool and he's a good guitar player, but it's been a year and I don't feel like I've made any progress.  I like how I can play whatever I feel like, but the thing is that I can't.  You can't just start someone out hard.  It's getting discouraging.  I can't tell my mom this though because  A. she's never available B. she wouldn't listen to what I was saying anyway and C. she'd forget about it nearly immediately.  Isn't that crazy?  My mom doesn't even have the time for me to talk to her about stuff I want to talk about.  I can talk to her about anythign insignificant, but if it's going to take more than 10 minutes to explain abaondon hope.  She forgets everything too.  I swear she'd forget to come home if she worked alone.  I hate this, I have a lot to say to her but I can't.  Whenever I decide I'm going to something comes up so I can't.  Gah, I wish she had time for m
