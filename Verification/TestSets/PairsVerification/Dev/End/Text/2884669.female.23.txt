he came in, he came in with his head down. We ran to him ready to console. He said, "I'm sorry guys, I didn't.." and then out of his leather bag, he pulled out that gold statue and said "WIN IT!". Me and my little sister just little girls then jumped up and down for joy. We hugged and kissed and just celebrated with daddy. As he always has done he almost broke our hearts and then he brought it home and we all celebrate.  They have been playing daddy's movie "Open the Sky" on the true stories channel, they used to play it on black stars and I lost my stars when I moved. Now they are playing it on true and I can see it again. I miss my dad, last time I talked to him was last month I think. Been a while since I've seen him in person. Thats why its so great to see the movie cause there's my dad on tv.  I know it's been a while since I wrote cause sometimes I gotta build up the nerve, the reserve, the experiences to write here. Things are going well, I'm still working me n marus are "still togetha" (c) the old couple on in living color.  I do have some bad news. The other day I woke up to feed the cats and only one came out to harass me for food. I looked for storm and he hobbled out of his closet hiding spot. I looked at his foot and it was mangled! We rushed him to the vet as soon as it opened and found out he had broken his toe. He broke it in such a weird way that either he would live the rest of his life in pain with his broken toe or it would have to come off. We think that he caught his foot in a swinging door, becuase it was windy that night. So my cat's toe has been amputated. We get the bandages taken off today. He's been limping around the house but thankfully he has been walking on his foot which is good.   But I do have good news also! I am starring in a play! It's my debue! The play is called ' Aqua Beats and Moon Verses'  and I play Moon Verses! It's a play about two really close friends and every aspect of their personalites and the issues that black women go through. From mama daddy issues, to reproductive rights, to just good music and art. I believe it is a great play and will be amazing. I am really proud to be in this play and I love my cast mates. They are all wonderful beautiful girls with so much to offer the world. I see something in everyone of them that is in me or something that I aspire to be someday.  So that's life in a nutshell right now. I should be back to tell you whether or not my cat's foot looks too crazy or not lol.  S
