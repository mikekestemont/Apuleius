the grass under the tree.    What kind of a tree? I do not know. The wind blew and I felt it cold.    School is about to close; the year is about to close. The store across the street is about to close. There were a few students lounging along on the grass, but no, there was no one with me under the tree. Another car is approaching my way; it’s the third in ten minutes.    The campus is about to close.                              On the grass, under my un-known tree, I watched as the sun changed the color of the skies. In a few minutes, it will be dark soon. But look, see, the sky is turning to orange, then red, then blue. Then darkness. The campus is about to close. I watched as those who lounged a few meters from me decided to go anyway.                              The year is about to close. The wind is cold. The field in front is empty.    I sat still, now on a large root under my tree.                                 My phone rang, three times I think, maybe more. I felt it. I reached and didn’t recognize the number. “What time is it?” I asked.    “What? And now you think you’re some place else, maybe the North Pole?”    The voice on the other line retorted, then laughed so hard.    I laughed along. “Damn phone call.” I murmured. The voice said goodbye finally and left me hanging, thinking what was the call for? Damn phone call.                              The wind felt cold and my heart murmured. Damn phone. I shouldn’t have brought it with me. I never wanted to own one anyway.    If they wanted to reach me, they could go ask for my home phone instead and we could all talk sensibly at the comfort and privacy of my room.    They could call me at night, early morning, any time.    There’s always a line for that. But not this phone. I don’t want a call, I don’t need a phone.    But I did buy one.    Damn phone.                             The night is closing in, should I call?
not telling the truth is the ultimate sin to me. talk or never mention it at all. should you plan to deny anything at all, make sure that i have no hint of knowing nor of doubting. my questions will probe even your darkest secrets. and my questioning will hurt us both that it is too painful to handle.     therefore, hide or stay quiet.
the sky seems to cry with me. my heart aches, my mind is a mess. what i know is that i do not know.  I am not at peace.     i wish to soak in the rain and wash away this burden.
