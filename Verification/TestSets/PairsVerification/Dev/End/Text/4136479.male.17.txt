draw a not-entirely-scientific parallel between the two situations (not-entirely-scientific because the speed of light is a constant). The light ray going in the direction of rotation can kinda "go faster," so it can orbit closer to the black hole. The light ray going against the rotation kinda "goes slower," so it must orbit further away from the black hole. Oh, did I say it had two photon spheres? Heehee. That's not quite accurate. See, since the black hole rotates, it's got an axis of rotation. It's no longer spherically symmetric like the other two. Its structure depends on what angle at which you approach the black hole. If you approach in the direction of the equator, then what I told you stands true: two photon spheres. If, however, you approach at an angle to the equator (you know, just like lines of latitude on the earth), there is only one photon sphere. Why? Well, if you come in from the top, there isn't really a choice of whether you should go with or against the rotation.       Do Black Holes Really Exist?    If a black hole, by its very nature, absorbs all matter and radiation that comes near it, then how would it ever be possible to detect one, short of falling into one? Astronomers have detected convincing evidence for the existence of several of these objects during the last 15 years thanks to the advent of x-ray telescopes. A black hole with another star in orbit near to it should be rapidly drawing matter from the star into it. The matter would circle the black hole in much the same manner as water going down a bathtub drain. This vortex of infalling matter is known to astronomers as an accretion disk. As the infalling stellar matter came closer to it's final destination at the event horizon, it would accelerate at ever increasing rates. The matter would begin to heat up, releasing photons of electromagnetic energy. Very close to the end of it's journey into oblivion, the stellar gasses would emit x-rays of intense energy. Astronomers search the sky for powerful x-ray sources that don't have a visual counter-part. Once an x-ray source has been located, the scientists try to determine if this source is a part of a binary star system (15). If the x-ray source is found to be part of a binary star system, astronomers can then calculate the mass of the unseen companion. This is done from spectral and visual analysis of the visual component of the binary system. Once it can be determined how long it takes the star to orbit the x-ray source, the mass of the source can be determined. If the x-ray source is found to contain, at a minimum, three times the mass of our sun, then astronomers are reasonably confident that a black hole has been discovered. To date, three objects that meet the above criteria have been discovered: Cygnus X-1, LMC X-3, and an x-ray emitter that has been recently discovered, known only by the designator A0620-00.
