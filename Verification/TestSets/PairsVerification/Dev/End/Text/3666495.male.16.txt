Friars). After resting in the Library and mocking Key Stage 3 practise papers, we went to the Sports Hall to factorise, functionise and...um...fart. Maths was, as expected, as easy as a very easy thing on an especially relaxed day. I completed it too soon though, leaving me with about an hour of sitting around...during which I memorised Pi to 11 digits (3.14159265359) and generally pondered. I am now home, listening to the chatter of the birds and some random song WinAmp has skipped onto. It's tripe though, so let me just skip on...ahah! The discordant symphonics of Eminem.

In a few minutes, we are going to Tesco Metro to buy food and miscellaneous items for youth hostelling. We are meeting tomorrow at about half 8 at the train station, for any aspiring stalkers out there.  Tonight is the Jack Hunt prom, as I believe I have mentioned. To be honest, I am not really looking forward to it, for various reasons...  Anyway, we are off to read about the fascinating world of vitamins on www.everything2.com.  Have fun, y'all.
