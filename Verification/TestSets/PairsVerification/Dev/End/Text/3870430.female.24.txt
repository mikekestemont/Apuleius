 urlLink www.eightshub.blogspot.com ), blog name (eg. The hub) and codename. DO NOT use a word you use as a password – this codename is public. My codename is “chickenchicken”.  Next you’ll be asked for basic, non-invasive information. Keep clicking through, and the program will send a password to your email address. Open up your email, copy the password, then back to sitemeter. You can now log in to site meter.  Once logged in, go to “manager” (on the menu bar). Scroll down to “adding site meter to your site”, click “instructions”, then scroll down to “adding site meter to a blogger or blogspot site”. From there, just enter your site details (and yes, I checked, its all safe), and it will put the meter on for you.   FINALLY… PICTURES!!  This is actually pretty easy. Posting pictures uses pretty much the same technology as messenger – and I know you know messenger.  Like the webcounter, you can only post pictures by using an external program. A free program is provided called “bloggerbot”, which is provided by “hello: picasa”. The difference here is that it’s a program, not just code, and you have to download and install it somewhere. By “somewhere” I mean “your home computer”. So guys – please do this at home. Do it at home or a) it’ll get very messy and b) Zoe will get into lots of trouble.  The easiest way to set this up is to go straight to hello. The address is  urlLink http://www.hello.com/how_bloggerbot_works.php . Read it, scroll to the bottom, and click “download now”. If people have trouble, I’ll post about it on the Hub.  Thanks everybody – we’re very close to having some very, very nice blogs up and running. Keep posting!
I tried. Really I did.  I cannot make this program accept the code I have written as code. Instead, it wants to show it as actual words... at least, it does when I look at it. You might see something else.  Either way - I'm making a printout for everyone as a supplement.  cheers, Zoe
Hi all!  Well, I've been looking around (and commenting on) all your blogs and I have to say - they look pretty good. The one thing that people seem to be having troubles with is working out what to say. This is a tricky thing - we've all got our soapboxes now, but what are you supposed to do with them?  I think we can throw quite a few ideas around on these blogs.  I'm going to hand out two topics a week for discussion - one will relate to Northern Lights, and the other will be current events/topics of general interest. If you have any suggestions, post them in comments right here at the Hub.  The next thing I'll do is put up links to everybody's blog, so you can find everyone else easily. I'm hoping that everyone will look at (and comment on) a range of blogs - read blogs that don't belong to your friends, you might be suprised by the ideas you find.  Cheers,  Z
