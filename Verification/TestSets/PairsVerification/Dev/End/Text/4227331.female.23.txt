lately have consisted of beer, beer bonging, shotgunning beer, and beer runs. I'm surprised that none of my friends have managed to dillute their livers enough for a transplant...as of yet. However, we are only 23-25ish. We still have quite a few more years of good hard drinking in our futures. It's Friday nights, though, that I think about the recent "lifestyle change" I've experienced and how happy it makes me.  I was living the high life for the past 3 years. In a relationship with a semi-decent guy, living comfortably in a nice home, in a nice city, 10 minute commute to work, a job that I adored, and my two kitties. Life was more than tolerable. However, we all are aware of the wise saying "The grass is always greener in someone else's yard." My friends all young and beautiful...and single. And here I was playing house with a man a few years older than me and a few decades more mature. And I use the word mature in the worst way possible. I use mature in reference to sitting at home ALL weekend studying real estate and watching ESPN. All weekend, every weekend. Where was my life headed?  I began to think about living that life for the rest of my days. Having kids and exposing them to the fact that their father was a boring old man and their mother was an unhappy dreamer. I began to quickly feel stifled and smothered. I felt as though I was carrying the world on my shoulders...yet I had no one that could REALLY understand where I was coming from. Everyone looked in on my relationship and saw how polite he was and how well he took care of me and how he treated me like a queen. And that was nice for a while...a short while.  Finally, after a few months of being away from the situation completely, I realize that I was never happy with HIM. I was happy with being with someone. Happy to go to bed with someone every night and wake up with someone every morning. Never wonder if I'm going to have to have dinner alone or worry about a date for the wedding next month. It was comfortable. To a certain extent comfortable is nice. Comfortable is convenient. But comfortable is rarely passionate.  As unfair as it is, I am constantly comparing any and all men to the first man that I ever loved.  Our relationship was nothing short of volatile. At eachother's throats one moment and struggling with eachother's pants the next moment. The good was incredible and the bad was devastating. I longed to feel that passion again.  I've finally come to the realization that I don't have to be WITH someone to be complete or happy or have fun. I need to find that within myself before I can give myself fully to any relationship. (Now let's cue the sappy music...lotsa harp!) My Friday nights now are fun-filled 23 year old stupidness. And I wouldn't want it any other w
