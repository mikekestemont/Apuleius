cuz I hate getting up all early.  My mom said if I get all A's next year (every term) she'll give me $50.  I asked her if we could count out spanish but she said no, cuz she thinks I can do good in that class if I really tried, and I told her that I tried all year last year, and every single term I got a c.  At least I don't have Ms. Eagleston, cuz that would really be a bad thing.  I got an F in her class and my mom is so mad.  But I have math and science for two class periods, and that means over an hour and a half.  I really wish we had Mrs. Meggers, she was the coolest teacher.  But Travis better be ungrounded before school starts, cuz then if I ask him out we can have a week to get to know eachother a little better. But I might not be able to get on here for a while cuz I'm gonna be so busy in school, I really gotta get good grades this year.
So yesterday (Sunday) we went hot air balooning with mom's friend Ena.  So I was kinda excited cuz I saw Jimmy again, but we barely even talked.  All he said to me was something about my south park t-shirt.  But there was this   really   cute dude who helped us pack our air baloon up, and his name was Jeff.  He got a ride back to the field with us, and he rode in the trailer so naturally I had to go in the trailer too.  But on Friday I went to the mall with Ej and her friend Keke, and it was fun.  We got lunch and we went shopping a little bit.  But Keke was bein nasty cuz he was all like "I was gonna say sumthin, but I can't" . So me and Ej just told him to say it and he told me "ur thighs r kinda big but thats good cuz if I ever had to fuck you there'd be lots of cushin for the pushin". LOL. But I go back to my dads in a week and I'm really excited cuz I get to see Travis again.  I've been thinking about him alot. I'm kinda on the fence about deciding to ask him out.  Maybe not. Cuz I might mee someone when I get into 8th grade that I miht want to ask out and travis lives far away so if I do ask out someone, I would have to cheat on travis and I wouldn't want to do that cuz he's a great guy.  But on Saturday I went to my dad's company picnic and I saw jesse but she didn't even talk to me.  I was gonna go on the alpine slide but I stayed with Ysabella.  We got a picture of her and it's so cute.  Oh, and I got a new happy bunny wristband when we went to the mall and it says "school eats it". it r
