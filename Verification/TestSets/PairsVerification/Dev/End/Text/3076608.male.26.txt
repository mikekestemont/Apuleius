get used to being alone. I should stop trying to make other people happy because no one really cares about making me happy. Still I have little pleasures left in this world and making others happy does give me some kind of joy. If I stopped, then I am afraid I would have little to nothing left to find pleasure in. Its a shame that I am left with making others happy because I cant seem to find out to make myself happy anymore. I keep thinking that living like a monk would be the true answer to my happiness. Everything I read about being truly happy all say the same thing "Simplicity is the key to true happiness" . Normally I would agree with that fully but my life could not be anymore simple anymore.  I have little to nothing to show for anything yet I am still miserable. Of course I think too that my life could be a lot worse, but if it were I am not sure I could handle it mentally.  Oh well, I know that this entry has been pretty sporadic and hard to follow but my mind is about on the same level lately. There is nothing that I can put my focus on anymore because every good thing is tainted by a black spot that I have to avoid now. I instead spend my time taking advantage of the good times and running from the bad. I dont even bother to talk or act on the things that affect me negatively. I just run. Is that bad? Is it wrong for me to turn away and refuse to deal with the things I cannot change? My feelings and opinions of others I fear is beginning to affect my normal everyday life. I wish I could go back to being simple minded and not knowing anything about the people around me. Instead I know too much. I know more information about people than I would ever care to repeat.  If I could just forget what I know and block out everything else I hear then I would be fine with the people that surround me. Instead I am stuck with knowledge that makes me dislike people in general. Everyone has dirt on them and it taints my image of them. Its this town in general. I was just talking to my latest platonic friend Miriam about the same thing this weekend. Both of us see this town the same way and that its grown old because of the people within it. I wish I could just start over. I wish I could forget the good times and the bad. If I could forget the good times, then maybe the bad times wouldnt seem so bad. Maybe I wouldnt have the problem I do with some of the people in my life. If I could have my way I would just filter out half this town, but instead I am left to just deal with them. How will I get by? I couldnt tell y
