thanks bagla I know u r a quick guy actually all men for jhalawar are quick I m right na . ( I wsa thinking who will be the first guy/gal to post after hectic week)  I have to share a joke sent to me by one o f my friends. I 'll just paste here for all of u    The Perfect Couple  Once: upon a time, a perfect man and a perfectwoman met.   After a  perfect friendship, they had a perfect wedding. Their life togetherwas,  of course, perfect.    One snowy, stormy Christmas Eve, this perfectcouple was drivingtheir  perfect car along a winding road, when theynoticed someone at theside  of the road in distress. Being the perfect couple,they stopped to  help.   There stood Santa Claus with a huge bundle oftoys. Not wanting to  disappoint any children on the eve of Christmas,the perfect couple  loaded Santa and his toys into their vehicle. Soonthey weredriving  along delivering the toys.  Unfortunately, thedriving conditions  deteriorated and the perfect couple; and SantaClaus had anaccident.    Only one of them survived the accident.  Question: Who was the survivor?       Answer: The perfect woman survived. She's the onlyone who really  existed in the first place.  (Everyone knows thereis no Santa Clausand  there is no such thing as a perfect man. )   Women stop reading here, this is the end ofthe joke.  **** Men keep scrolling.      So, if there is no perfect man and no Santa Claus ,the woman musthave  been driving.  This explains why there was a car accident. Men Keep scrolling   >
Hi guys.........& gals,      Seems maths assignment and extra classes r taking there toll. bcoz there is no new blog here since 12 August....not even a copy pest operation ;-).      by the way last week was full of happenings with thanxgiving party , i- day celebrations and than quiz on 17th .It was a miracle that Prof. CVRS postponed his assignment due date & i had some relief.but there r assigments lined up for the next week EM , BCDH, QT etc. to mention a few.But as usual, everything will be completed by last date.      Seniors had the best of last week with winning everything they participated in &amp; i think we must have a dope test fron next time onwards.      Also i danced on stage for the first time in my life.And the poem 'NEEND' was praised by many.       Also 'Indra Dev' were at their best during full week with not even a single day sparing with rains &amp; it was really enjoyable to watch n hoot for Football match in rain on I-day.      rain also showed its magic in my home state Rajasthan where till 15 days ago Govt. was planning for Drought Relief and now they have to plan for Flood relief(It happens only in India).      by now the postponed date of QT assigment is again approaching and i think i should leave n prepare for that.
