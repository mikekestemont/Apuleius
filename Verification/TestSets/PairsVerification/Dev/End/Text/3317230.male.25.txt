out, it's a thai kickboxer movie, complete with "Let's See That AGAIN! AND AGAIN! AND AGAIN! AND AGAIN!" type stunts, but it's amusing, I love how at the beginning he makes a promise to never ever use his supreme ass-whooping powers, you just know that's the time when you set your watch for 2 minutes from now... when the supreme ass-whooping frenzy begins.  The scens are pretty predictable, like, the hero gets chased down an alley-way, which is full of hawkers selling various fruits and precious fragile antiques, which are promptly squashed and smashed.. Also, guys seem to always carry some strange obstacle into the center of the path just as our hero is approaching. We then see him jump through the ring of barbed wire feet first, we then see him jump through the ring of barbed wire feet first, we then see him jump through the ring of barbed wire feet first, we then see him jump through the ring of barbed wire feet first, It's awesome!      It's cool to watch their legs, they bend in ways you wouldn't expect possible, somehow they can make their knees swing up and come out of their foreheads.. It's like they're aliens..  Considering how awesome it is, this post can only go downhill from here, so i'll end it.
I've travelled half away around the world to escape these monsters. I'm wearing headphones, blasting music, but all I can hear is middle-aged white women laughing.  What the hell? I thought they were all safely tucked on the 60/62/65 express buses?  Hey, could you keep it down a scoche? Some of us are trying to study!  I guess that's what I get in the cafes. So if I can't study, I'll blog.  Last night was interesting, I fell asleep listening to a cantonese-learning CD. You know how when you listen to mono in headphones, it sounds like it's coming from inside your head? It can induce some strange dreams. For some reason the english would command me what to dream about, and then the people would speak cantonese.  It was really creepy. I remember I got really pissed off because I was slowly realizing that everyone I knew could speak perfect cantonese... Amy and Joe (my sister and her husb.) were the first, then Lily and Stella (my young and extremely young nieces). Then everyone else, it was pretty discouraging..  I spoke to auntie (I don't think I'll ever get used to that word "auntie") at dinner last night, she understood the first thing I said, but then i think i must've gotten nervous and messed up the rest, 'cause then she looked pretty confused..  So all I managed to say was "I was up until 5am last night". I think later when I was saying "I want to speak cantonese", i was saying "I want to smoke cantonese"... Probably not the right thing to say to my future inlaw. Damn tones. When you're nervous, it's difficult to  sing  what you want to say.  Um.. the bothersome old ladies are gone now.. study t
