stop my workout. David, Jadyn, and I went to our church youth camp (Bogg Springs Baptist Camp) with our 9-12 year olds. The three of us stayed in a cabin about 1/4 mile from the camp. Every morning, I would get up and jog to the camp and back, do 50 crunches and 25 push-ups. After breakfast, I would walk around the campground until morning service. I would walk again during rest time after lunch, including running the steps of the old hotel, while Dave and Jadyn were playing putt-putt. A second round of crunches and push ups, and I had a good workout each day.   (NOTE: The above entry is PURE FICTION. I didn't do SQUAT on my vacation except have a happy-tray every&nbsp;stinkin' camp-food meal! What a vacation!)
This has been a different week. My workouts were limited because one of my dearest friends had serious surgery, and I have been at the hospital with her each morning. It was in the waiting room during her surgery that I was reminded, once again, one of the reasons I am working out in the first place.  Arlene, my friend, is loved by so many people. So, of course, many people were in the waiting room to make sure she was ok. Arlene also happens to be one of those pixy-elf friends I have (as were most in the waiting room). I said that I was going to tell her that they made a mistake in the operating room and gave her a breast augmentation instead. Cindy warned about making her laugh because Cindy's husband made her laugh when she had her C-section (he said it looked like she swallowed a spiral notebook) and she had to hold her tummy together because it hurt so bad.  This led to a discussion of scars. (We sounded like a bunch of old people.) I mentioned that my sister-in-law (who also is a pixy-elf) said that her C-section scar almost has faded away. I said, "That's one advantage to being my size. I just tuck that sucker up under my belly and it's hidden for life!"  Forget about Mederma; I have EPIDERMA!
When the cat's away, the mouse will play at working out.  Jeremy has been at a conference all week, and I must admit I have slacked off.  Slacked off...who am I kidding?  I've been rather pathetic actually.  I need a spin doctor to save face for this post.  Hmmmmm...let's see...     I have taken some much needed time to allow recuperation in muscle mass so the neurotransmitters from my brain will flow unimpeded by lactic acid build up.  (Nah)    Someone stole the workout equipment.  (uh-uh)    The ratio between days off is inversely proportional to the amount of exertion released on days spent exercising, thus allowing the summation of reserves to target the abdominal region in a relaxed state.  (in my dreams)    Sea world called.  They needed to borrow two training harnesses for the new killer whales.  (There ya go!!!)     Actually, I've given up my dreams for six-pack abs.
