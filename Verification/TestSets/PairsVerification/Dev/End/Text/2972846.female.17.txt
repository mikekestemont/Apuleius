idiots, this can't be. i was raised by the same person who raised this idiot, THIS is so scary. maybe I'm such an idiot aussi and I just don't know it? or maybe I'm a differnt kind of idiot than W. is? that must be it. but then everyone must be an idiot, because: the person who raised me too must have been an idiot, right? and the person who raised the person and siblings of that person who raised me and W. must have been an idiot too... and so on and so on. or maybe it's some kind of a +/- reaction? like the person who raised W. isn't an idiot but the offspring is idiots. or maybe this +/- reaction occurs between me and W.? like he's the idiot and that makes me a non-idiot. ok, so let me believe the last theory in order not to loose my self-conidence or sth...whatever. wrote loads of shit again and should read a patriotic, antiswedish and antiturkish book composed of 3 parts of which every part has at least 450 pages and loads of senseless 5-page-long conversations about nothing but always with a historic background. the 1600's. that's all. gonna grab this book then and finish it till wed. or so.  from today:  the ultimate top 10 list of my most hated songs:  1. maroon 5 - this love 2. jamba - sommerhit ("ringtone" hahaha) 3. eamon - f*** it 4. eamon - i love 'em h*'s 5. avril lavigne - happy ending 6. o-zone - dragostea din tei 7. mario winans feat. p. diddy & enya - i don't wanna know 8. nina sky - move ya body 9. cassidy &amp; r. kelly- hotel 10. B.E.P. - let's get it started  actually there's one clip i like - it's kelis' "trick me". i like her hair and that orange background and these arrows... it's a good one. artistic. interesting. worth letting it on for a few times if you have the choice between maroon 5, eamon, avril lavigne and cassidy. another one i kinda like is outcast's roses and actually hey ya - also because of the idea. it' s 'ok' clips. even kinda funny and very "positive" (hey ya) and one clip that too is good but it's very old - it's a-ha's "take on me" but my ultimate 'favourit' - if you can call it like that :) is thomilla & Ã¶zlem's "slap that bitch". i like the clothes the models wear in that clip. i may change my mind cos i saw it only once and wasn't really paying attention (people have better things to do than watching music channels. looks like i'm napoleon.) ok, it's 11 and i should be doing some other stuff than writing about mtv and stuff. pity i don't have ftv anymore. i could fall in trance and watch :p ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .
