to pick up some damn weights and exercise for forty-five minutes? Why would I rather sit on the couch and read a book instead of going for an invigorating run? I read books that inspire me to continue with the struggle, but it seems to get harder, not easier. Does  urlLink Steve Ilg  wake up in the mornings and think he’d rather do just about anything than hop on his bike for a four hour ride? No – he loves riding his bike. Give him several hours of free time, and he’ll be outside. Give me several hours of free time and I’ll look for a great new book to read. That’s not a bad thing, but when it comes right down to it, his passions make his body healthy and strong, mine encourage sedentary habits and weak muscles. It just doesn’t take much physical effort to turn a page.  I’d gladly trade my ability to speak in public, my love of reading and my appreciation for a hamburger and fries for the burning desire to exercise hard every day. Since this desire doesn’t seem to come to me naturally, is it possible to develop it? I’m thirty-seven years old, damn it, and I’ve been obsessed with building a great physique since I was at least sixteen years old. Twenty-one years later I’m still struggling with extra weight and what feels like chronic laziness. Is there some way to work with my personality instead of struggling to change it?  My desire to be fit has come to represent to me all of the dreams I’ve had and never achieved. It’s something perfectly possible that at the same time seems incredibly impossible. Intellectually I know that if I exercise and eat right, my body will respond. My inner self believes something different – the Monkey Mind whispers that no matter how hard I work, I’ll never overcome my propensity to overeat and my resistance to regular exercise. Until it becomes a joy, how can I expect it to be a regular part of my life?  I started this journal because I was inspired by the book  urlLink Total Body Transformation  and wanted to see if adding a spiritual component to my search for fitness would prove to be the missing piece. It may still be, but I wasn’t expecting my own resistance to the spiritual. I’ve grown a hard shell of cynicism and defensiveness in response to my fundamentalist Christian upbringing. The warrior in me longs for God, the Monkey Mind screams out arguments proving that there is no god.  Regardless, thinking about all of this has underscored one thing: I continue to struggle with both the physical and spiritual aspects of my life, but I haven’t given up. I may stop exercising for a month or two at a time, I may not push myself particularly hard for several workouts in a row, I often still eat much more than my body needs – but damn it, I’m going to keep working at this and I’m going to make it h
