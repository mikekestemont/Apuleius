it's absolutely ridiculous not that I  imagine college to be too much different. Me and my friend adam were talking the other day and he said he loved college and that the only difference in college is that the most of the idiots are filtered but there are some idiots that slip through the cracks that's ok I guess. I'm just ready to close this chapter in my life, that's sounds so corny but that's really how I feel. Well I'm going to go for now............. until then
Well I haven't written in quite sometime.. where shall I start? I don't even remember the last time that i wrote in this blog thing well  I had a slight interruption my baby called. He is so wonderful and can in the midst of all choas always put a smile on my face. He doesn't know that and I don't always let him know that but it's alright I guess.I went through this extremely unhappy phase for a little while, why? To be completely honest afterward I never know why I let myself be unhappy for that long. But now that I'm happy and perky I haven't the slightest clue why i was unhappy oh yeah my mom could have something to do with it lack of communication with my significant other could have something to do with it. You know the other day he told me that he thinks that his dad knows that he's going to marry me, well my parents know that I want to marry him... And my mom said that he's growing on her and little does he know my dad likes him which is wonderful. The night before my graduation party Evan came over to get an Dvd and I gave him cheaper by the dozen when he got home he put it on to watch and text message me and said i'll give you nine kids.. And i you wonder why i love you so much.. there's so much to look forward to with you and that's one of the many reasons he then said give me nine more and i did. Some days that's the only thing that cheers me up that there's someone out there who loves me as much as i love him. but anyways. Family life hasn't been a complete buzz kill, my brother is so cool as hell my mom hasn't been nagging lately and my dad has been pretty cool.  It seems like the closer it gets for the time for me to leave the more my sister and I argue and sometimes it's just like alright already but i just for some reason can't give in sometimes but other times it's not so easy. I've been pretty content with doing nothing really I have before that would have driven me absolutely wild but now im content with watching a little tv writting in my journal reading talking to my other half and then just sleeping I crave sleep now a days I'm tired so this is enough for this t
