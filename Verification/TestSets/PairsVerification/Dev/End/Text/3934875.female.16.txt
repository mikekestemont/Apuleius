Cos we were with our loved ones.. Saw Zaid and his gfren.. He was shocked when seeing me and Amirhadi. Nevertheless, we had fun that day. Took 14 home.. Saw abit of S'pore Idol.. So bloody funny man.. Lodsa crappy talent.       That was it. I reached hme close to 11. But i enjoyed it.. cos I get to spend the day with him and my friends(for a while,at least).. Hehehehe     ~Put my soul on hold,let it drop like my heart,cos thats the way you want it to be~
~Put my soul on hold,let it drop like my heart,cos thats the way you want it to be~    On Friday, i went out with Didi.. Went to eat at Raffles Hospital's Banquet.. Then walked arnd at Bugis Junction b4 makind our way to Suntec City by foot. On the way we passed Shaw Towers and we decided that we'r gonna watch a movie on Monday there.. It seems lonely and not packed at all.. Hehehe we got official on that day too..      Today i watched the fireworks at Pan Pacific Hotel with my mum's cuzinz but they are considered my cuzins too aniwae.. Thats a long story to tell but nvm..  The fireworks are so nice!! I love it.. Tomorrow im gonna watch it with Didi.. After watchin The Village at Shaw Towers.. which is like only walking distance frm Esplanade. Hehehe.. I tink i just take the mrt home la.. Cos if i take 196 back, it'll surely get jammed at the roads.. Especially 196 passes by Kallang.. Im not willing to take the risk..       Haix.. Been thinking alot.. Some of Didi's frens dun like me being with him.. With some of the guys calling me a 'pmpan sial'... They are the sial ones.. Ppl change rite fuckers.. One of his frens is my ex.. nono,2 of his frens are my ex's.. both of whom i dumped for no apparent reason.. Okok.. when at the age of 14,im in a state wherby i onli enjoy the attention frm guys.. I totally am not commited like i am now.. Ppl grow up.. hello? Fuckers.. Thanks so much for just lowering my self esteem and confidence in my new relationship.. Fuckers.. I'll say it again.. Fuckers!      Okok.. im getting pissed off rite now.. Havent washed up.. And i feel so fuckin thirsty.. Even tho i already drank so much.. It that time of the mth..
