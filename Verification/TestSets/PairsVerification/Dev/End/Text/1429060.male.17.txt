still needs to come back to Memphis. Her cousin Amanda should come too. We will flee this little circle of inferno to somewhere grander, like Nashville. Hot tub party in the Ritz, ladies and gentlemen.
Alanna is home , so you should bring her tribute and lay it at her feet. She sings like a muse, I swear to god. Even though she denies it vehemently. Gah. Future music career for that girl, methinks. I can see it happening. She'll be on the cd's front cover.  Swinging is flying. Alanna and Brock and I are elementary students with wings forever. Alanna and I were married in midair.  If only I had a brain.
Uma Thurman is soo pretty. Gattaca, Kill Bill, and Paycheck. Three movies and in all three Uma is so lovely and pretty. I think that she has hips similar to Laylee. But she has replaced Natalie Portman as my favorite actress. The favorite actor still goes either to Johnny Depp or Orlando Bloom.  Currently talking to Manda, Amber's cousin. I think Manda is cute and lovely and sweet. By the way, Amber moved across the fucking state last night. This is bullshit. We're on the edge of her goddamn senior year. Ladies, we're having a senior party in Nashville when we turn 18. At a hotel. In the hot tub. Mocking our parents.  About to watch  once upon a time in mexico . Depp depp depp depp...  Gone folks.
Radio is one of those movies that always makes me want to crawl into the fetal position while watching it. It is very good and emotional and extremely well done. One should watch it for the purpose of having that experience. PPV or Blockbuster. Choose one.  There is a lady who works at the pharmacy who is well past my age. She has pale skin and black curly hair and this wonderful smile that she gives to everyone; quite attractive. I think I have a crush on her. This, however, is a bad thing, for, as I stated, she is in her mid-thirties, whereas I am but an adolescent. Damn age barrier.  Searching for a companion...and still unsuccessful. I am so ready for college to steal me away right now. Bloody senior year of high school. I am ready to escape this drab city for other locales. And other possibilities for lifestyles.  Zoe is one of the most precious people I know. Wonderful and adorable.  The internship today was lethargic. All morning I was half asleep, whilst sorting files of patients and trying to find if this woman recieved genetic counseling or totally ignored the cancer institute's calls. However, Dr. Fowler (director of Dept. of Genetics at Baptist and my employer) used my information on his rare disease presentation. A special rush of energy for seeing that. Dr. Neese (Dr. Fowler's co-worker person) and I made fun of Dr. Fowler while he was presenting. In front of the research nurses and oncologists. Sorry about that, Dr.  I need sleep. Check-up tomorrow. First time in about six years. Cheers and dream quiet d
