Not really very good is  urlLink it
Are the contributors of  urlLink this conversation  people I know? There are names I recognise and topic seems to be very familiar...
While there are many people out there who purport to be time travellers, there are only actually a handful of Warlords of time. Well, I only know of five, myself and  urlLink Chronomochron and his family of mini warlords  but, as you can imagine, we can be anywhere at anytime so it's not surprising we don't bump into one another.  Oh by the way, Chronomochron is a bit of a megalomaniac and I don't agree with his use of time travel. His wife and kids are lovely though.
Hope this chap managed to get what he was  urlLink after
As you know, I went to play pool with  urlLink Stuart  last night and you can read all about it on  urlLink 9-ball blog . I must say I could have tinkered with time to get a bit more practice in, but that would be wrong on two counts:  1) Using my time travelling abilities for that would be abusing my position as Warlord of time  2) It gets tiring going back and forth all day squeezing in the extra hour here and there, by the time I'd got enough practice in, I would have done a 70 hour day.  Oh, and for all of those who ask, 'surely you can go back again and sleep it off?' the answer is yes, but then I wouldn't have time to put in the practice, so I would have to go back again to do that, savvy?
I think 'trip' is a very appropriate word for this little  urlLink story
urlLink Stuart  has invited me to join his and  urlLink Satan 's  urlLink 9-Ball blog  I am playing pool with Stuart tonight so will be posting there anon...
This is what I was (guess warlord wasn't an option), what about  urlLink you ?     You're a dragon. You're smart and cunning, and enjoy taking risks. Your need for independence is an advantage, but sometimes it alienates you from others. As far as *good* and *evil*, you're pretty neutral--but you may have something of a wicked streak.
Do not overclock your PC, it could be  urlLink dangerous
urlLink see...
Am wondering whether I should find out how to reply to  urlLink this  and give them a hand. They must be feeling  very  d
