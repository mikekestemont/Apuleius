I think about. Well the answer is is that I think about a lot of things that are bothering me and how maybe things could have been or could be different. For example, last night I thought about Megan and everything that was going on. I thought about how I really do care for her and that part of me can't bare the thought of losing her. I also thought about other girls I have liked over the years I have dated Megan.   OK....OK I will finally admit it to myself and everyone else
I only have one week left of work and then I am off for another year or even for good. It has been good working at Blimpies for the past four years but it is time to move on. I will only miss a few people I work with and of course my two bosses and their son. Four the past four years I have had the privilege of working for two of the best human beings that have ever lived. They have done so much for me and have cared for and loved me through all of my ups and downs. I don't think I can ever repay them for what they have done for me. All I can say is that I love them dearly and hopefully I will get to stay in contact with them as well.  On to other notes. I am scared for school but starting to get used to the idea of me as a law school student. However, what is scaring me more is the fact that I will be alone this year. I have never been totally alone at school. I have either had friends to hang out with or a girlfriend to talk to. This year their are neither. My friends/friend lives in Denver and I haven't even talked to him in a week. Megan has dumped me and has moved on to other guys already (Amazing how fast she can get over me). And well the other few friends (at least I called them my friends---I don't really know if they would ever do the same) are either moved back home (Melissa O.), moved to Denver (Megan B., Aaron, and Cindy), or I just don't know how to ask them to talk to me or hang out with me (Brandon, Jeremy, Nathan, David, and Ryan). I guess this is part of me being alone. It sucks but at least I am hanging in there.
I feel so lost right now.  It looks like this is the final time that Megan and I will break up.  She is bound and determined to make this break up last and who can blame her.  I don't know who in their right mind would want to date me.  I just feel so lost right now and this past weekend did nothing to help the matters but I will write about that tomorrow.  Right now I feel like getting into my car and just leaving....maybe then I can do what will make everyone h
