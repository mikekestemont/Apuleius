15 minutes!!! what a swell guy. Now if only he wasn't such a fucking CUNT....thats right i said the c word. I am 'grounded' to the 22nd, that's two and a half weeks, for a bullshit infraction like the night biking. It's fucking hilarious how much my parents trust me, i am one of the most straight edge people there is, and yet i am pretty sure my mom thinks i'm a fucking drug addict. I love how people get smaller punishments then i do for getting caught with fucking alchohol and yet my parents give me two weeks for being out of the house at 3 am....like OMG guys. So, now that i know the punishment, i have no problem bringing about a war between myself and my parents, it's about time they realize what fucking douchebags they are.  p.s. anyone know the fasted way to bike to vancouver...please leave a detailed description.
so, i was original going to tell you about a revelation i had well going biking (with my shitty bike, not the good one) at 2 am. But something new, and actually entertaining has come up.  I'm now grounded. But it's funny though, because i'm grounded for sneaking out of the house at night... daaaaaaaa, let me think. I was able to sneak out when i wasn't confined to the house, what makes you think i won't be able to now. Now my dad is going to want to have a nice long talk about why i go biking at night. I am basically not even give him that much. I will ignore the topic alltogether. If it comes up at dinner, i will leave the table at starve that night. If he calls me down for a 'family meeting' i will totally ignore him. Also it is remarkable that he even thinks i would mind be grounded....o wait, he's under the impression that I HAVE friends. Haha, this is really very amusing, i will have to see how it turns out, and whether or not i will have to eat my words.  Anyway, on to the revelation, this isn't really all that startling, but o well. Nice guys finish last. I know it is unbelievably cliche, but it is the truth. I have been the nice guy my whole life, and it has gotten me nothing in return. Empathy gets you know where. Stop caring about others.  ...that is all.
i hereby retract any statements refering to one P.W. as being an assface. I have decided to make this retraction, i guess as an act of good will... i dont know. I expect nothing to change. I already know august is going to be exactly like july until i get my bike, and how much of a difference that will make, i do not know. So, you are no longer an assface, but you may feel free to continue to keep distance from me, and i will atempt to do the same.  32 days till school everyone are you excited...i know i am.  o, and still no b
