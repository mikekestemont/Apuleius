Hello again. Well I'm blaring Three days grace on my computer as I write this entry. I love having this blog. It really helps me get out my problems. I love my new template too. Blackness and darkness, just like my soul. Anyway. I'm listing "Just Like You" by Three Days Grace. GREAT SONG! LISTEN TO IT! It's very awesome. I love those guys. They're great. THey help me with my anger issues. My favorite though is "Home". That song is like practically my theme. And now "Home" just came on! YES! WOO! *runs around cheering* Well I should be updating my stories on fanfiction.net but I'm low on ideas... Well actually I'm just lazy lol. Well I should be going but... I don't wanna. Harry Potter 3 comes out in theaters tomorrow and I only have 3 more days of school left. omg. HAHA "Three days" and "three days" grace HAHAHA! *cracks up* That was funny! Anyway... I'm gonna go! BYE!  ~Charm  Home  I'll be coming home  Just to be alone  Cause I know you're not there  And I know that you don't care  I can hardly wait to leave this place  No matter how hard I try  You're never satisfied  This is not a home  I think I'm better off alone  You always disappear  Even when you're here  This is not my home  I think I'm better off alone  Home, this house is not a home  By the time you come home  I'm already stoned  You turn off the tv  And you scream at me  I can hardly wait  until you get off my case  No matter how hard I try  You're never satisfied  This is not a home  I think I'm better off alone  You always disappear  Even when you're here  This is not my home  I think I'm better off alone  Home, this house is not a home  This house is not a home  I'm better off alone  No matter how hard I try  You're never satisfied  This is not a home  I think I'm better off alone  You always disappear  Even when you're here  This is not my home  I think I'm better off alone  Home, this house is not a home
Well HELLO! Thought I had forgotten about you didn't you!? NOPE! I've just really busy. Like depression over taking me and this fucking stupid camp I had to go to. Well I'm bored this day. I just saw Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story, which is fricking funny! I never laughed so much. Even these old ladies were cracking up at the  VERY VERY VERY  crude humor that was inovled in this film. BUT IT WAS FUNNY AND THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS! Whew. I'm hyper. Well I must be off... I'm bored and kinda upset now... D
