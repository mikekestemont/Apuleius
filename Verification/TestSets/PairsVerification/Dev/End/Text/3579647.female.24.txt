followed Susy's announcement that they were a band from that city.]  The music was as intensely fun as at the First Ave. show - highlights included my current fave "Matt's Song," as well as some raucus cuts from their new album: "Ten," "Angel A," "Channel X," and "Don't Say No."  One of the coolest aspects of this band is that everyone genuinely gets into the act; or, as they say on both full-length CDs, "everybody sings."  Some of the songs that induced the greatest amount of floor-stomping and head-shaking were the ones that featured a call-and-response between one band member and the rest.  For example, "Ten," which entails most of the band screaming out digits while one singer provides a list of 10 very particular reasons to love someone.  And "Pass the Flashlight," which is a classic gals-answering-the-guy tune, was incredibly fun live.  The track off of  urlLink Rock Against Bush, Vol. 1 , "Paranoia! Cha-cha-cha," also energized the crowd.  I was so pumped, I bought LP and LP II and have been listening to them all day at work, though at sinfully low volumes so as to not disturb less punk-loving co-workers.  The albums are great and contain songs about politics ("There's a Banana in My Ear" and "Winning Is for Losers"), the media ("Channel X" and "The Land of Clear Blue Radio"), and love ("Matt's Song," "Love Song," "Tonight") that are effective and remarkably subtle and un-cheesy.  Oh yeah, and super rockin' and fun.  Another positive aspect - all four 'Ettes seemed to be enjoying themselves and played two extra songs to please some rowdy, happy fans.  And if you're interested in their bodily reactions to playing such an amped-up set, let's just say there was less need for sweat-wicking than at the First Ave. show, especially Sturgeon, who had redefined the meaning of *sweaty* in Minneapolis on June 13th.  My three housemates enjoyed the show, but I have to admit it was less fun being with folks who had never heard the music before, and at least one of whom is hesitant about listening to anything harder than Sleater-Kinney, than being with a real fan, as was the case with the First Ave. show.  Which is why the circle was only semi-completed.    Taking words from "Her Neon Heart":  In the city, people live. They take in all she has To give, and breathing Out they breathe life In - So the cycle starts again.  While this is true, it's becoming increasingly clear that each city has its own unique cycle, and seeing a band that hails from one locale won't exactly transport you there.  Though you'll come close.
