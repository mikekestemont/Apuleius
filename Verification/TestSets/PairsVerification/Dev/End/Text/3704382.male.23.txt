this time i have the equally equiped opponent as she knows how to talk as well. So, i think this way things would be interesting in few days. I am feeling sleepy now. See ya guys. Allah-Hafiz.
Well, today was a tiring day and i had a lot of work. Well, i liked and respected girls since i was in schools you must be thinking that what a hunk started to look for girls since that age. Then my brother the point is i always used to think alot and got to the point that i need someone whome i can share my all feelings without fearing that the other person would tell everybody else or would blackmail me ...etc. So, my journey started since i was in high school i still remember that girl. I still don't know her name.By cutting the story short,i saw few girls standing on the window of the first floor facing me. You know what i was and am very shy and don't usually start first. I saw a girl out of those smilling and passing looks. Well, it was the first time for me. haa haa yeah my friends same old crap came into my mind keh yaaar, yeh tou line maaar rahi hay. I still remember how stupid i was at that time ( I know many of you will say 'still you are' :) ) The very next day i bought a yellow marker and write on the paper saying 'I LOV U' and started waiting for her very keenly she came by the window after 20 minutes and i showed it to her and she smilled back to me. Ufffffff! it was like a volcano had dispersed inside my body, yeah, i know it is very typical but i thought i have fallen in love. ;). Well, that was the moment of life time. In those days there was hit song on MCC   Nadya keh sang kinaray  Chandaa keh sang hain taray  Koi nahien hay tanhaan mairay siwaaa   ;) i remember listening to it alot. haaa haa haa.   On the weekend i thought about her that is she my dream girl, the girl that i adore and want her more than any thing in my life? In few minutes my logic asked me as an input that does she smile at others as well? To answer this question i replayed all the events in my mind and found keh yaaar, this radio set catches all the channels. Aray baaap reh, I thanked Allah keh He saved me from this mistake. Aur wooh aik week end kaa Love kaa Fever was gone on the weekend. Although i still have to pass from her house sometimes but i never tried to go back there.  :)  On that day i asked my self what is LOVE yaaaar?  How do we know we are in love?  What are the symptoms of love?  Does love exist or not?   Oohhhhhhh My! i really forgot that i have to meet the deadline in the office tommorow.  Till tommorow B
