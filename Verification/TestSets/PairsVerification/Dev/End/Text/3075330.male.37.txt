them on wrong.  You used a leg hole as the top.  The top is over here.  A:  Oh (hee hee hee hee)    (Night-time prayers)   A:  Thank you God for my elephants. Thank you for watching 3-2-1 Penguins. Thank you for Nicholas and Ainsley. Thank you for how they treat us. Amen.
Did some random cruising around through blogdom last night and today.  I was surprised at how many depressed? angry? lost? confused? frustrated? ??? youth pastors there are out there.   No judgement here, just surprise.
Well, it's raining tonight and our suspicions about a leaky roof have been confirmed.  It looks like we have a leak around our sewer vent.  The water is running down the outside of the pipe and getting into the ceiling of our first floor.  Put a  very  temporary stop-gap up there tonight and will have to take another look at it when it's dry.  We had the bathroom done 7 years ago and the guy who did it did something up on the roof 'cause we had the leak then, too.  Hopefully, we can do something like that again rather than getting a whole new roof (which Ron estimates at $4,100--he's not a roofer but he plays a Chaplain during the day...)
In our study on Sunday night, we were discussing  urlLink Psalm 101  and the forceful language David uses when dealing with evil.  He, being king, was able to exert this type of force on his subjects and his enemies.  As we discussed "force", Luke 16:16 came up:   The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John. Since that time, the good news of the kingdom of God is being preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it.   The NIV Life Application Bible has a footnote that indicates that while the exact interpretation was disputed, it is generally accepted that this speaks to the multitudes that were responding to Jesus' message of the Kingdom of God.   The Bible Gateway  urlLink commentary  puts a different spin on it stating that the word for "force" is a passive use that refers to the message being applied  to  everyone rather than  by  everyone.  I'm not sure I agree with either.  In  urlLink context , Jesus is addressing the Pharisees and their desire to appear righteous before men rather than before God.  This coupled with the reality of Jesus ministry (he ended up with relatively few devoted followers--most of the multitudes that followed Him seemed more interested in the healing and miracles than Kingdom life) makes me think that this verse doesn't address His "success" or some promise that is extended to all.  A very similar phrasing appears also in  urlLink Matthew .  Here there is an interesting illustration of how "this generation" is like children who want things their way.  I plan to study this this week but my initial impression is that Jesus is addressing people who hear the Good News of the Kingdom and then adapt what it means to suit their own desires--rather than the Truth.
