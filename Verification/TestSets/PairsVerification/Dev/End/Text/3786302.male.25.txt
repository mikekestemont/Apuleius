by the government for compensation from the state? If you actually dig into facts, you might find only a fraction of the farmers compensated. What did the students achieve by committing suicide because they failed in an examination -mostly tenth or twelfth? Aren' t there their friends who have also failed but have had enough courage to say that "Maybe better luck next time. This is not the end of my life." Taking one's own life is the biggest sin you can ever commit. Even the holy scriptures like Gita and Bible consider it as a sin. God has given you a life with a purpose. Every person on this face of earth has a purpose. Sometimes the purpose is trivial and may not bring about catastrophic changes in this world, sometimes it might not bring you name and fame, sometimes it might not bring you money and power, but it might be just enough to touch somebody's life. The thought of death results from an empty mind, a mind that does not have any direction, any ambition, a purpose in life. Everybody has problems in life. The man eating in a golden plate, the man flying in the high skies, the man on the footpath, everybody. If there were no problems in life, man would be as good as a vegetable. The only reason we are not vegetables is because God has given problems, be thankful for that. Atleast to overcome the problems, we think, we work, we cry, we laugh, we strive to eliminate them. The best way to overcome such thoughts is to be restless for success. Be greedy for fame. Be mad to reach your goals. Strive hard to fulfill your ambitions. Think of alternatives to reach your goals. If one alternative fails, choose another, if that fails, then another. Don't stop until, at the end of the day, you get what you wanted. Set small goals for each day, set big goals for the month, set bigger goals for the year, adn keep working to achieve them. Failures are the stepping stones of success. There are innumberable examples to quotes the truth in this line. Read about all the successful people in any industry. The only reason they are successful because they did not get discouraged from their failures. Infact, every failure gave them more and more aggressiveness and restlessness to become successful. And last but not the least, Where there is a will, there is a way. If you kill your will, the ways are closed for you. I am not a PMA Teacher nor am I a preacher, but my life goes by a very simple policy - Whatever goes around comes back, so give happiness, get happiness. Life is too short for you to experience it 100%, but then you can still strive to make it 100% happy by living life to the fullest. And most importantly, I have a goal, that makes me wake up every morning an think of ways to achieve it. You will see me at the top...very s
