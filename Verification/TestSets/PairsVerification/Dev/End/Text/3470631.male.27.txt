serious.  After that first night, the joke became more detailed and took on a life of its own. 2 bored writers sitting in a New York City pub, with nothing better to do than sketch an idea.   From the beginning, they both agreed that there was no such thing as a perfect murder. It was the contrived notion of bad fiction and Hitchcock movies.  After each night the idea became more and more developed – more and more crystallized. Weeks later, neither one could be quite sure when the idea became plan. There was no moment of realization, no moment of clarity. Like any “good” idea, the more complex and structured it became, the more reality seemed to encroach.   ---------------------------------   They are coming for me. I can see them in the mornings when it is foggy. I will be ready though. I won’t give them the satisfaction. I’ll be ready.   ----------  To be continued...
So I don't know how many of you have seen Shig's new girlfriend - but it's time to unveil her, as she is a very cute girl.  Congrats Shig! Sorry!
I caught the tail end of this show last night and I have a weird crush on Nicole Richie.  I think that it is just the way she says: "that's hot" or "loves it" that makes me like her. Maybe it's her money.  One week from now I'll be driving with Vito and Mlufkin to far northern Vermont for the final Phish shows. I think I'm as much (if not more) excited about the trip and the experience than I am about the actual concerts.  Anyone catch the final Ashlee Simpson show last night? I missed it.  Anyone see the Village?  I"m looking forward to seeing Open Water. Looks right in my wheelhouse. I won't swim in the Ocean - so the movie will not affect my habits. I know JJ and BF Carroll can respect that. I heard they used real sharks in the filming of Open Water as well.
Tough times in Mjwern's World. Not much new to report.  Did some prerequisite celeb ballwashing last week during the DNC in Boston. Sightings at the after-party I attended: Nancy Pelosi, Wesley Clark. Definitely B-List - no question, but hey it's something for Boston.  Qdog and I ran it absurdly hot - staying out till 4 am last Monday Night. Worst idea ever - but it seemed like a decent one after 5 Krispy Kremes and a ton of liquor.  My new drink is Jack Daniels on the rocks. It makes a statement - not a BIG one, but it's something.  I also think that it's cool to smoke cigarettes. Not that I do it (at least not often at all), but there is something old Hollywood/Very Cool about sitting at an Oak bar, drinking Jack on the rocks and smoking a ciggie.  That said - I can't pull off that look. I wish I could. I think my hair's too short.  It's a good look though is my point. Anyone who says it isn't - isn't very cool.  S
