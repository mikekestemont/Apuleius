"The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science"                         - Einstein  Doom 3 officially came out Aug. 4 for the PC and I of course rushed off to Best Buy after work to try and buy a copy. I was successful but it wasn't until today that I got a chance to play. The visuals in this game are amazing, easy the best I've seen. The music is awesome as well. Seems there are fewer weapons compared to games like UT 2k4 and I was alittle disappointed in the few types of multiplayer games (no CTF). I thought about what game to compare it to, to help describe it to a friend but I couldn't. It really isn't like CounterStrike, UT, FarCry, or Halo. It is an awesome game but so far (I am still in the beginning) it is pretty much going down one-way corridors and shooting stuff. I don't feel the skill demands compared to some of the above listed games. But still a great game, I suggest everyone buying it to try or playing on a friends or something. I paid $55 for mine, which is alittle high, so I suggest if you don't want to pay this just wait for it to go down.  On a more mac note, Doom 3 is being developed or converted for both the Mac and Linux but I haven't heard anything about when. Id Software seems to want to do a good job so isn't rushing this. It should also be out or coming out for the Xbox, I think.
WOW!!! I just finished playing a really fun game called  urlLink Peasant's Quest . This game is great because it is not your average run-of-the-mill game. It is text-based with a graphical interface. To play the game you use commands such as get, ask, talk, use, and give. The object of the game is to kill Trogdor the dragon because he has burninated your cottage.  The game was made by Videletrix for  urlLink HomeStarRunner .  Homestar is a flash animation  site.  It is my favorite!  The best part of the site are the  urlLink Strong Bad Emails .(Strong Bad is a character on the site). Be sure to watch some emails before you play the game. This will give you a taste of what the site is like so you will enjoy the game that much more.   BE SURE TO WATCH THE EMAIL CALLED  urlLink DRAGON !  IT WILL MAKE THE GAME MAKE MORE SENSE!   Have fun playing this throw back game. Remember things aren't always as they appear. If you need help with the game or just have a general question leave a comment and I'll help you.  HINT:  Try typing the word die in a non-critical part of the game.  HINT2: If you REALLY need help check out this   walkthrough  .   Happy Dragon Slaying +
