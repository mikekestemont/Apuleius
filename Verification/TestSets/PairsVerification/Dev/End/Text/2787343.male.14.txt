in the library, en hao was the only one who doesn't know about it. then after com lesson, we all urged en hao to run back quickly for class, and HE REALLY DID, and he ran back to the classroom instead! quah was like laughing aloud with us throughout the lesson. of course, later he was sent to the library as well. oh btw, quah is the one who set the lit term test. and, if it's ms kala, i bet en hao won't be strolling back to class so frequently.  teocm is not in a good mood nowadays. she's been quite "un-nice" this week. just today, she instructed 2 guys in our class (those who did not finish hw) to go with her to her afternoon lessons, in 3K. However, she's still quite fun in class. I really hope she will teach us again next year.
Seniors are beginning to know my blog too. At first, i only allowed close friends and relatvies to know about it. Now, it's sorta all screwed up. have to be really careful about what i blog now, or some adverse side-effects may happen. yi kun can be really a good specimen.    National Day  Singapore's National Day (August 9th) is approaching. Quite unsignificant to me, but i'm looking forward to the holiday. This time, including weekends, it's a total of 4 days. So, sit back, relax and enjoy the holidays. Malaysian scholars can use this opportunity to go back to Malaysia. IF only we are rich enough, we can use this opportunity to fly back to LA too. We can spend about 48 hrs to get the USA summer feeling. Since Singaporeans are busy singing national songs (such as Count On Me Singapore) this also reminds me of a song, Back In The USA by Chuck Berry. Liked the song quite a lot.   Tests  Once again, tests are starting. So it's time to study again. Hate tests, and we still have final exams at the end of the year. but luckily, next week we are taking Year 1 Geography, History and English Literature for the last time. With the MRP, there are no final exams for these subjects. On the whole is quite "shuang", dunnit to study, haha. But I'm worried about History and Geography. History we haven't really done revision, we still can't even finish the textbook. For geography, our past class tests have really been too easy and "low-standard", when i took a peek at the geog. test papers of other consortiums, got a big shock. This type of questions really need the application, not only memorizing.
