(that's Saskatoon for those non-Westies).  We saw DodgeBall which was tres funny - despite the fact that we showed up too late and had to sit in the very front row.  (Neck braces are in order)  Thanks for the awesome idea Jeff - proud to say that I am moving wonderfully this AM and am off to the dentiste in a couple of hours!  Otherwise not too much else new.  Had a wonderful Canada Day up at the cottage.  A little R&R was in order!  Got in 3 rounds of golf (two of which were disastrous!) and about a million more freckles.
Well I did it.  I officially pulled the chute yesterday and handed in my two weeks notice (it felt so weird to hand over an envelope - I thought it only happened in the movies!!).  After two years at AGF it was time to make a change.  Although I will miss the peeps there, I am really excited about starting a new adventure.  On September 1st I will be starting at the Canadian German Chamber of Industry and Commerce (say that three times fast).  I am really excited about it.  Everyone in the office speaks German all the time and I will only be working 4 days a week.  The plan is that I will try to start my Masters in German part time and work on that the 5th day.  I just can't believe it.  I woke up this morning to the thought that I am no longer employed at AGF (well after my 2 weeks are up) It just doesn't seem real.  But as my favourite saying goes - I do not regret the things I've done.  Don't look back - you're not going that way!
OK the computer is not back from the shop yet - but in the meantime - check these out:    urlLink http://jjforms.blogspot.com
Well we have come to the end of another Sloan Weekend - and what a weekend it was.  The neighbours have been appeased (after a 3am shouting fest from the Man Voice - "Ann and Lyle it or ...."), the gymnastic style wetsuits (what a party game that was) have been put away for another year, and the copious number of wine bottles and beer bottles returned!  We all learned that Crest is the work of the devil (but fuels an amazing game of Celebrity Smack-down - I'd like some proof that Uncle Hans exists!) and we'll have to teach Ellen and Catherine the new running/dodge game in the cottage.  The Sloan concert itself left much to be desired - but meeting the band after was AMAZING! The $175 taxi ride was made enjoyable with Boston songs ("More than a feeling"??) and Ellen's rendition of a song we will never know.  The midnight grazing of a family size serving of lasagna, followed by some 'smores and a "dip" in the lake were also enjoyable moments for me.  Thanks guys for the amazing weekend - and always remember - Compliance Rocks!  See you next year.  (Photos to follow when I get them from J
