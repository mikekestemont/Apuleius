they own the place... i wont mention any names... anyway its just weird how fast people change and how things change ...like i remeber back at greystone where nobody was popular or geeks every1 was average and every1 liked each other. i guess eveyrthing has to change sometime now next year or this year in september we'll all be in the high school and i may not see any of my closest friends next year and thats really weird like in a way i am looking forward to high school and the other half if me wants to go back to ricci even though i hate that&nbsp;welfare school so bad.&nbsp;&nbsp; anyway i have nothing else to write i'll write back later
