POW. Military service should not be a deciding factor in electing officials. It's just funny how well Mitch fit in with the rest of the Bushies. Why does the Republican party get so much credit for patriotism?  The pillars of the Daniels campaign are Integrity, Health Care, Jobs, State Government Reform, and Education. Let's take these in order.    Integrity-My Man Mitch wants to end fraud and corruption. Where was he for MCI Worldcom, Enron, and the sweet contracts that went to Hallibuton and Bechtel?   Health Care-Mitch worked for Eli Lilly, sounds like a conflict of interest? No way he's going to help with the rising cost of health care.   Jobs-Yeah, nice job destroying the economy and losing jobs. Mitch might be able to give advice on what not to do in order to grow the economy.   Government Reform-The Republicans typically want to starve social programs, but Mitch worked for the Bush administration. I guess the government might explode in size under Mitch. Too much or too little is not the answer.   Education-Can you say unfunded mandate? Leave No Child Left Behind must mean something different to conservatives.    OK, I'm done ranting for now. If I'm way off base on anything, I apologize; but then, you came here for my opinion. It's time for bed. . .later.
I don't have anything to add today. I did buy a new game for my computer, though. It's called   The Political Machine   from Ubisoft. I am glad to report that in my first attempt, Kerry/Edwards easily trounced Bush/Cheney. In my second game, the behemoth combination of Hilary/Bill didn't even break a sweat against Condi and someone, I don't remember who the other loser was. It's an ok game, I guess. I think the biggest complaint that I have is that it doesn't require that much thought on issues. You just need to pander to the electorate in major states. Oh well, maybe I will have something more for you tomorrow.
I'm being overdramatic with the title. I'm talking about U.S. basketball and their recent  urlLink defeats at the hands of Puerto Rico  and Italy, and their horrible outings in the World Championships. The World Championships were supposed to be a wake-up call to U.S. basketball. . .they weren't. The loss to Italy was supposed to be a wake-up call to U.S. basketball. . .it wasn't. The loss to Puerto Rico might be something more. This recent loss may be a slap in U.S. basketball's face with the realization that, while we may produce the most athletic, high-flying players in the game, we may no longer produce the best basketball players. Which brings me back to Larry Bird's ill-conceived lament about the  urlLink decline of white players in the NBA . There are plenty of white players in the NBA. There are even quite a few good white players in the NBA. What Larry Bird should have said. . .well actually Larry should have kept his mouth shut. Larry needs to start being concerned that the NBA draft will leave out all Americans, and not just white A
