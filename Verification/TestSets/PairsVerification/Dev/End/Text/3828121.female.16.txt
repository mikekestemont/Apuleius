over. i don't wanna have to deal with them. i mean, there's some people i prolly wouldn't mind seeing, llike heather and mel and david, but everyone else....i just have no desire to even be around them...  i don't even know how to feel or what to do about the nathan thing. i really really really like him, and i want so badly to think that he feels the same way, but he tainted everything when he did what he did. totally ruined it. like, i still like him a whole whole lot, but now when he says sweet things, part of me is all girly about it, then part of me goes back to that and wants to say something hateful in response. i talked to him tonight, and i still don't feel any better like i thought i would. i asked him if this was going to be a reoccuring thing, he said no. not like he would admit to it if it was going be, but i'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt on this one, just because i feel like i may go off the deep end if i don't. i want to be with him. i really do. i don't wanna have to let him go.

Too much to handle, another person to let go that i don't wanna give away.   Stressed over a truth thats yet to be proved   but it will surface, it will always surface.   And then, once again, I'll be hurt   when I knew all along that the pain was inescapable.   Too much hurt for someone who's not worth it.   But oh, how he's worth it   They're always worth it.   If not, I woulnd't have so many scars littering my wrists.       i dunno what to do anymore. i've been listening to "She Will be Loved" by Maroon 5 for the last hour or so. I want someone to feel that way about me so badly. i really d
