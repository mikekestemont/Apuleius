lasts the 2 week wait. It's good intentions that count, right?  Anyway, for now, I am trying to remember what it's like to live life without the colored glasses of a woman desperately trying to conceive after miscarriage. I don't want to be desperate, and I don't need to be desperate. There is time, and if it's going to happen, it's going to happen. I have to keep in mind my major lessons in life...patience and faith. Both have been tested a hell of a lot this past year, but if I don't learn, I'll continue to be tested.  Here's trying, with as much patience as I can muster, and in good faith...  _____________________________________________________________   Many thanks to my visitors and your comments, by the way! Sorry it took me so long to say so, never mind say much of anything on here. Life's been a little crazy, but I so much appreciate y'all finding me and taking the time to say hello.
I'm feeling the need to break out of my shell today. Must be that BF(ucking -  there ya go, Janet...good idea, actual cursing helps somehow )N this morning, closely followed by AF's pet Spot -- that damn Spot's bite definitely hurts. The signs are telling me that I am out again this cycle, and that I am destined to continue on this ttc journey for a while longer, kicking and screaming if I must...

Here's my disclaimer:    I make no promises that this will be remotely interesting or entertaining, but I will be baring my soul, which may sometimes include some hope-inspired blathering and other times some disparaging, pathetic whining about how much this ttc after m/c journey can suck the big banana.  Thanks for reading if you are, and thanks for commenting if you do. If you hate me and my verbal diarrhea, please don't tell me and please don't torture yourself by hanging around. I don't need to be loved by everyone, and I can totally take (and sometimes need) a good well-intentioned cyber bitch-slapping like my good friend Janet is quite adept at doling out, but my occasionally wavering and hormonally shifting self-esteem really doesn't need a beating, either.  If you can stand my drivel, please come back, and let me know you're out there once in a while. Thank you ever so kindly! ;) (Yes, if you can't tell by now, I am a bit of a d
