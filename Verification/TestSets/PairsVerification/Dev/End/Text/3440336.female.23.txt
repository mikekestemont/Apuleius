up and down for it to stop. I felt like waving back. I could even see a few people swearing back at the bus as we left them standing in a cloud of exhaust. My second scolding was at work. The copy lady. The color printer ran out of 8 1/2" by 11" paper, so I was scrounging around looking for a few stranded blank sheets. With no intentional prompting she asked me what I was looking for. I told her, 8 1/2" by 11" color printer paper.  "WELL THIS PAPER IS ONLY FOR THE XEROX MACHINE SO DON'T EVEN THINK OF PUTTING IT IN THAT PRINTER."  Alright already, what's with the hostility today? I wasn't even near her and the stupid Xerox paper. Mistake #2. I don't know how to solve this one. I wasn't even looking at her, she just decided to bud into my life and make me feel stupid.
In Washington, DC, it's, "Who do you work for." In New York City it's, "Where do you live?...and just curious, how much is your rent?"  I love how open we city folk are, asking perfect strangers their yearly incomes and dishing about the thousands of dollars we shell out of our empty pockets for our pint sized studio apartments.

He couldn't keep a  urlLink caged bird  safe if he tried. But as I was walking through the World Trade Center Path station this morning, I became irrationally angry at the tourists, standing, ogling at Ground Zero with this sad look in their eyes as if they felt they had to be melancholy. I just wanted to yell at them. Get out of here. Aggravated because they are here staring at the remains of our horrid past when there are threats of truck bombs being planted all over midtown and the financial district. For their own safety, LEAVE, and if you happen to live in California, take me with you.  The commute seemed to take hours this morning. I was hardly able to focus on Hollywood's latest dates and break ups. Even Jennifer Gardner and  urlLink Michael Vartan's  break up. Never Been Kissed, hello, hot.  I am bound to NYC and NJ public transportation, they own me like a subway and bus riding bitch, unless I take a $50 cab ride home, but that is just ridiculous. So I guess all I can do is pray for my, Adam's and our friend's s
