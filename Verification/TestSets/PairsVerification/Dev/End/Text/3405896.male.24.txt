"defense mechanisms" part of the discussion. It's a major wham. It can make things complicated. It can rock your lovely boat. Let's just say, you're in total shape and you don't mind any other things. I know our subconscious will go hunt us down, but . . . yeah. . .   ...what if my subconscious really hunts me down? Geez....It will probably be another bullet that will knock me dead.
THE BEAUTIFUL ONE   Brewing With Confusion  I have never felt so strange about myself until today. For the first time in my life, I cannot define whether I was happy or I was being miserable. I know my friends would tell me in their usual way of advice that I’m just going through another phase again. But really, I have never felt this much confusion. It took me 24 hours to get all mixed up and question a lot of things about my understanding of what I really want in my life.   I didn’t have enough sleep for two nights now. I know that this actually aggravates my state, but then, I cannot force myself to sleep as easy as switching off a light bulb. I have been battling with my own evil. I seem to want “things” that I know can destroy me and I want it to stop. My desires are quiet. It boils deep down inside me waiting to explode. I long to be with someone who doesn’t even know my longing and I am worried because I don’t know if it’s doing any good for both of us. This is probably a usual case of ‘sleeping attractions’ suspended by distance and only awakens when the right circumstance of contact occurs. And it’s true. What makes this worse is that I’m supposed to know exactly what to do. But I don’t. I’m seeing visions of hopes of embracing reality that is about to break down. But the surreal longing is now becoming stronger that it’s overshadowing my own concept of reality. It scares me.    The Beautiful One  Dipping in the evening waters with the crescent moon teasing down on us was a perfectly blissful moment. It felt like the whole world was made of water. And it was beautiful. For a while, time didn’t exist. It was just me and the beautiful one. Our ballet in waters had stirred the sleeping planktons that apparently surrounded us like fireflies breathing with scents of tulips. Even with my eyes closed, the tenderness that held me close to the beautiful one seeped through my eyelids and created a symphony of colors so much better than the rainbow. Everything fell into place with more wanting, more yearning and more intensity. My academic mind was put to a full stop. It was my heart feasting on the moment and it was bad.    The Future  I don’t know. What I know is that I’m still thinking about those moments. I’m still fighting and I don’t know when this fighting will be over and which will triumph. I just wish I can find the answers s
