MEh i guess you never get it untell it is feed straight into your face by the person you trusted the most. U think that you can take comfort in them and that they will always be there but eventualy they stab u in the back,Just when u least expect it. Most of you dont know what i am ranting about but i think that the person who this is inteding to go to will figure out it is for them. I mean everything is fine in what not untell you see that person with someone else and what is the best part the person they are with is you friend who you also take comfort in. Well i dont like writing alot so i am going to leave it at this, i cant belive you could make me hurt this much, i never new anyone could but you did congrads GOD I CANT WAIT TELL ERIN COMES INTO TOWN
