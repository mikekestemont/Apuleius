's!  One charming, if slightly odd-smelling, old lady bought some romance books and said the magic words a total of nine times. NINE TIMES!  Jesus, just say "thanks" once, will you!  Hand me the books, they say thanks. I scan them and say the amount, and they say thanks. I take their money/card, and they say thanks. I bag their stuff, they say thanks. I hand them their change and receipt(s), and they say thanks. I hand them their books, and they say thanks.  It is possible not to say anything to people except the words "Thank you", and "That will be (insert amount), please".  Which I have also done on a VERY dull afternoon, just to amuse myself.  So, what do we learn from this? Use the words "Thank you" sparringly, or they lose all meaning.  Okay, it isn't a great moral, but it'll do!
I have the invite to go and see "Hellboy" tonight, at a vaguley private showing by 'Titan', the publisher of semi-decent quality graphic novels and such like.  I really, really can't be arsed.  This is worrying me... all I am going to do after work is go home and watch the new "Adam and Joe" dvd that has just came out. I really need to get a life, don't I?  *sigh*
I'm sitting in a net cafe, on my lunch, and the charming young lady next to me, dressed in black and thoroughly goth, is looking at a Stephen Gately website.  Now, fact-fans, as we all know, he was the rabbit-loving one from Boyzone.  I don't know... these wannabe goths everywhere.  Tsk.
You know, sometimes, all I can think about is burying an exe into the heads of my so called friends.  Wonder if I'd get away with it, saying that the axe carried no warning label against chopping people in the face with it?  Hell, I could sue the axe-making company......  Hmm. I may have stumbled on a new get-rich-quick scheme.....
I went to feed the ducks today...  In Stockley Park, a bizarre business-cum-leisure complex, they have a bar, a lake, a gym and so on... many upper-class Uxbridge types go there to get fit, drink heartily, play golf and so on.  Being a lower-class Uxbridge type, I just go to feed the ducks in the nicest place in the area.... not one shopping trolley or drunken tramp to be seen.  Hurrah!  Anyway, I started happily feeding the ducks, and then the fish that came up for some food, and then, OH JOY OF JOY, a little turtle appeared! So, I fed him some pizza and off he went.  Okay, he didnt get pizza because he wasn't a ninja turtle. He got a bit of soggy bread instead which, now I think about it, probably doesnt compare to a nice deep pan but there you go!  Also, being a hot day, I wore some breezy cool trousers and a sleevless top.... "Top up the tan", I thought.  Now, I have a white body and red shoulders, and vaguley brown arms. *sigh* I need a hanky for my h
