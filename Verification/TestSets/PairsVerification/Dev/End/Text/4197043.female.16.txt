feel extremely honored if she did something for me. I'm going to see Bourne Idenity with the gang today(Chelsea, Ronnie, and Kasey.) at four something so I'll probably just stay up at work till they get to the theatre. I'll probably end up falling asleep in it. I've been so dead lately, but that's okay. Mom said it wasn't the best, but that it was good. William wants me to go see P2 with him on Friday. Only reason I'm seeing it is because I'm in love from the Aliens,and have watched the Alien and Predator series a hundred billion times since I'm was a kid. I'll be a bit upset if this movie is gay, but it looks like it has some good animation to it.Anyway I'm off to work...later.
Well, this is my first time having a blog. So I'm not quite sure what to put on it. This weekend I got really tiffed at someone, but I'm not going to go into that. It'll just get me mad again, and I don't feel like being mad today. Three days of it is enough. I went to see The Village last night with William, a friend from school. It was a really stupid movie. We'd gone to the mall before that, and I got an awesome poster from Spencer's. I went to Hot Topic and saw a few shirts I wanted. They had this really neat looking Evanescence shirt, and a A Perfect Circle shirt that I wanted. Oh, I also bought this book filled with blank pages so I can start writing a story using all my RPG characters. I designed each of them to fit together with each other. Anyways enough about that. I need to go back to the mall in a few days to get the second Wolf's Rain DVD. I really like that show. Some people don't like it because it's too serious and kinda boring to them. I like it though, I'm a real big wolf freak so seeing an anime completely devoted to wolves that are actually drawn and animated really good is awesome. The first DVD I bought of Wolf's Rain came with a Kiba plushie. It's so cute and chibified.( Is that even a real word?)It also came with the sound track. I'm hoping this next DVD has a box set with a poster or something and a new plushie. I really want a Blue plushie cause she's the best character off that show. Enough about that, after I buy that DVD I need to save the rest of my money to buy a laptop. This computer just isn't cutting it anymore. I'm also need to hook my scanner up so I can upload some new pictures on it. I have a project I want to do. I wanted to draw anthro versions of the Chinese Zodiac. It would be a whole lot of fun and I'd get some good practice with drawing different animals, besides wolves. Anyways the cookies are done cooking so I'm going to grab me some! L
