and Jason couldn't come (busy w/ touring San Diego and baseball, respectively). Somewhere in between Ng calls and wants to hang out too. So it ends up being me, Jonathan, John, Brian, and Ng. We saw  The Bourne Supremacy , which was an awesome action flick. Great camera shots. I went to Panda for the second day in a row. John and I get almost the exact same fortune. Whoa. Sunday (7/25): After mass, went to pick up vacation pictures (10 rolls) from Costco. My mom and I swing by Best Buy to look at digital cameras. We eat baja fresh. There are a lot of asians there. My aunt and my cousin came over. They were planning to shop for a digital camera. So were my mom and I. So we all went to Best Buy. We end up getting the same camera, and I get a scanner/copier/printer/fax. Whoohoo! Hence my ability to post pictures online now ( urlLink http://jtab.photosite.com ). We ate at panda afterwards (my third day in a row). There are a lot of mexicans there. Monday (7/26): Woke up around noon (as usual), ended up going to Burbank to plan what to do on Tuesday for the TBS in store/concert. Took Adrian. Met Triana, Jen, Angela. Chris was sick. I went to panda for the fourth day in a row. Somewhere in between I get convinced that staying over at Jen's is a better option than staying at home. So Adrian and I stay over. We walk around at 2 am, racing shopping carts and stealing flamingoes. Technically, this is already Tuesday, so Tuesday (7/27): We get to sleep at 5 am. Jen has to take Ang to school at 7. Me and Adrian sleep more. After picking up Angela, we end up hanging around Montrose, then Angela's house. Hmmm I guess we're not gonna go to the concert. Oh well. Wednesday (7/28): Did nothing. Stayed at home all day. I must be tired. Or lazy. Or my usual self. Thursday (7/29): Surprize party for Jen's bday. Ang and Tri take her to Outback as Adrian picks me up. We blindfold her and take her to the beach. No one told me exactly which beach. Adrian hits a parked car. End up somewhere near Huntington Bch. We pounce upon an abandoned bonfire. Me: "Toilet paper makes me ANGRY! AAARRH!" We leave for Tri's sis's house in Long Beach. Me: "You might as well just crash the car now." Friday (7/30): Do nothing all day. Go to a viewing in the evening in Hollywood Hills. Look around Barnes + Noble for some travel books. I buy a new CD case at Best Buy. Saturday (7/31): Exchange party at the beach. I spend over half an hour looking for a parking space (if only we looked at the invitation we didn't know we had). Sunday (8/1): Everyone wakes up late, so we go to church at the Cathedral. Then eat at the Pantry.  Go to Pasadena for more exchange essentials. Radio Shack and Vromans. I should be p
