and am looking damn fine in a short skirt. I was wasting all of these emotions on something that didn't match up.&nbsp;   Throughout the initial shock of realizing that I have been cheated on, repeatedly, throughout even&nbsp;the strongest times in our relationship, and with the most heinous women, I &nbsp;am actually quite happy for the realization that&nbsp;this confession has offered me.&nbsp;Because it makes me worry less about him as a person, and more about him as a mental case, like I would care for a beleaguered homeless man on the street. No longer do I have to treat him like a wounded woodchuck half-runover&nbsp;on the shoulder of the highway, trying my best to wish he could walk on his&nbsp;own, nursing him along to becoming a better living being, with a six figure income, a six pack and and some half-decent cooking skills.&nbsp; Now I&nbsp;can stop blaming his lack of effort, or&nbsp;his parents for their poor rearing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I can understand that crappy things happen to crappy people, and I can visualize him so much&nbsp; more easily now as a pathetic head case,&nbsp;and&nbsp;not really like a functioning member&nbsp;of the&nbsp;society I live in.   So in&nbsp;the best way possible at the moment, and being someone who will be followed along by good Karma for my&nbsp;actions, I have given him the forgiveness that he so desperately does not want from me. I have not freaked out on him and crumpled on the sidewalk as we stroll through the&nbsp;streets back to the train station. In fact, I&nbsp;thank him for the heartache that&nbsp;makes&nbsp;life interesting, and since I have had a good life, a little drama is always in need to give you, what my college theatre professor used to call, "Treadmarks on the soul." I also thank him for giving me the reason to not kid myself about us getting back together, or pining over him while I&nbsp;search for&nbsp;an attractive guy to take me out.&nbsp; I keep on giving, because I know in this way, it kills him to see me take it so well. I think in a way&nbsp;he would like to see me sucker punch him, or call all of my friends to beat some sense into him.&nbsp; He&nbsp;wants the anger to come out in me so that he can release a little bit of that guilt he is feeling,&nbsp;to release the pressure he is feeling in his soul.&nbsp; But I won't let that happen, because guilt is much better revenge than heartache. And he will need all of the friends he can get when those ghosts start to haunt him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   I think about Lance again in the end of all this, conquering his own demons within to overcome the challenges that life has thrown him, and excelling to boot. With that, I think that maybe I should be holding up the five fingers instead of my ex-boyfriend, overcoming the ideas of these five voluptuous demons that tempted away the man I used to love, not altering my reality in any way and showing me the strength that I posses.&nbsp; Beat that.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;    &
