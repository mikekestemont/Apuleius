suddenly we'll be carried on a wild ride that's going to be fast and furious because of the combining of our two worlds, as well as the beginning of her first career job, first time to live alone, and first time to live 9 hours from home.  I have full confidence that we can, with the LORD's help, emerge on the other side of this wild ride holding each other's hand, much closer than we are now, and prepared to climb the next hill.  If this is a relationship that can continually honor the LORD and benefit the kingdom, then that is my prayer.  Talk to HIM for us, if you will.
Down to single digits in the countdown of days until I go to South Texas to see Sarah.  Times are good, and yet the clock doesn't seem to speed up, no matter how hard we wish it together on the phone.  She's excited.  I'm excited.  We're excited.  We can hardly stand the anticipation, and yet the anticipation is what causes the excitement.  This is a great time.  Today I took a number of youth group kids to experience frisbee golf...a game that none of them had ever played.  The high school boys pulled ahead and left me with all the jr. high girls...Some of the boys spent more time in trees retrieving errant frisbees than they did playing...we drank a lot of water...it was windy...we met some guy who was drinking beer in the public park and passing out free frisbees to my boys.  All in all, it was a great day, and I think everyone had a lot of fun.  Note to anyone interested - if you decide to play frisbee golf, pick up some of the actual disc golf discs rather than playing with aerobees and cheap walmart toy frisbees...you'll play better and lose fewer of them.  Also, the youth group started a challenge to read one Psalm per day for the rest of the summer.  I made the mistake of not asking kids to declare that they were taking the challenge, so now I don't know if any of them are doing so.  I should find out.  I'd love to see them experience the wonder of the Lord through his word.  All in all, summer has been great, and amazingly, it's half way over.  I can't believe how quickly this thing is flying by.  Really makes me reconsider the preciousness of the time I get to spend with these youth group kids...sometimes it seems like it's only a few minutes.  Here's a cool quote from a youth minister friend's bio on his church's website -   "Hobbies/Interests -  I love the out of doors. Hiking, mountain biking, riding four wheelers, and sports of any kind. I love Youth Ministry and consider it enough fun to count it as a hobby on some days. On the other days, I head outdoors to get my brain back. If that happens to take me to the mountains of Colorado or New Mexico, then it's a really good day."  Good call...good c
