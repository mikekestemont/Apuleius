 However the larger fridge is a rusty hunk o junk.  Went to clean the layer of slime that had developed under the rotter (aka vege crisper, but nothing gets crisper in there!  You should have seen the sentient life I had to dispose of!  Actually, it wasn't too bad.)  Spent some of today researching fridges.  So I went to The Goody Guys and Retrovision.  Retrovision was very helpful and not too pushy (I played my "must discuss with fiance" card to new shames to leave and have a think) but the Good Buys almost completely ignored me.  The first time I was there, the guy only asked if he could help when I stuck my head in between him and a fridge while he was talking to someone else and the second time no one even said Hi.   Maybe it's too aggressive to front up to a shop with a catalogue and a pen and paper, but if a purchase is more than say $50 and is not clothes/shoes related, it's worth shopping around for.  (Retrovision will give me free delivery, planning on going back tomorrow.)  I thought one where the fridge would be on top would be ideal (I also wanted one that's left handed, open fridge with left hand, remove milk with right makes sense to me!)  But they're more expensive than "normal" fridges... and don't get as many stars (chew up more power).  This seemed a bit odd at first, seeing cold air sinks, so surely you would want the freezer at the bottom.  But I figure that normal fridges work by freezing air and letting it sink.  Must must must get frost free!!!  Also minor dilemna over old fridge, but new municipality is having a hard rubbish collection day in early August.  But as it's technically my brother's fridge, I shall contact him first.  Invention for the day:  Self cooling food.  Duh.
I changed my profile Industry from Student to Non-Profit.  There is not a lot of money in Professional Thinking.
Since I last wrote.    Benji and I got the keys to our new place in Burwood.  Picked up the keys.  Since then have been doing a thousand small things and moving a rather large amount of stuff.  I resolved to go through my stuff and throw a lot of it out.  Some of this I have achieved.  Things tend to go into three piles 1. Definately Keep 2. Rubbish  3.  I don't know.  The I don't know pile can be further broken down into 1. The Salvos would take this 2.  I am keeping this purely for sentimental reasons and I shouldn't and 3.  This is stuff that I could need ANY MINUTE NOW!!!  All very silly.    Plans for the future.    Oh if only it was that easy.  I am organising our engagement party in September (on Grand Final Day - it's tradition.)  No other definate plans, some exploration.  Ivention for the day:  Self packing and sorting house.  Or better still, a bin that knows what you want to throw out and goes and gets the stuff i
