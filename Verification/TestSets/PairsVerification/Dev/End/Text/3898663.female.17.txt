and run around the house naked, but I still don't think it would help much, because I am still sweating from every oraphis...  The parents are still gone, and the thing is, they didn't plan to be gone this long, normally I so wouldn't mind the continued quiet...but they didn't leave me with enough food, and if I tried to cook. Hmm, lets not go there. I am still hungry though and I might brave Hamburger helper for the sake of I want to finish my Bronchitis medicine which must be taken with food and I have discovered that it doesn't really work with cereal.   Mathew needs to be saying more than one sylable words to me...  I think I am going to go make myself some dinner now because I'm hungry and crap.  Ciao~
Since it is morning and nothing today has happened except me watering the lawn, cleaning the house because I haven't for the past three days, doing laundry, and working on my summer school class....I shall tell you about yesterday afternoon and evening, which was slightly more exciting...  *deep breath*  Okie Dokie. I shall tell you, I did go and get milk, which made my day a little better. It took me awhile to actually tell myself I did want to get dressed, go to town and get milk, but I eventually did it. I got home and had to get ready for work...I hate work. It requires pretending you care for far too long. But yea, I fould out my friend's parents are having a garage sale...and so I'm going to go and buy all my things back, that I left at her house, because they are selling all her things...since she was emancipated last week. Great fun. After I got off work, I went home, changed out of my work clothes and got dressed to go to a movie with my Mathew. King Arthur, great movie, I enjoyed it greatly. Then I came home and read my book until I fell asleep....Then the strangest thing happened this morning...I was waking up every hour and 10 minutes...It was quite bizarre.   I have decided not to go to school today, I seriously don't feel like taking a shower and getting ready to go, so I'm not going to, besides its hot out there and it's cool in my house, so I think I will stay here, finish my class and wait until the family returns home.    I might write later, depending on how I feel.  Ciao~
So, we are going to start this thing out by posting a rant...Why? Because there is NO MILK!!! *glares*     Let me begin...  My parents left me. They went on a 4 day vacation to the coast and left me here alone, and I told them to leave me AT LEAST 3/4 of a gallon of milk...I should have known...They didn't. I got a grand total of a little less than half. Arg. I'm mad, and I have to go to the store and buy milk and bread and that makes me angry...GRRR!!!  M
