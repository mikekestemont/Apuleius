 - Garth Brooks  Looking back on the memory of  The dance we shared 'neath the stars alone  For a moment all the world was right  How could I have known that you'd ever say goodbye   And now I'm glad I didn't know  The way it all would end the way it all would go  Our lives are better left to chance I could have missed the pain  But I'd of had to miss the dance   Holding you I held everything  For a moment wasn't I a king  But if I'd only known how the king would fall  Hey who's to say you know I might have chanced it all   And now I'm glad I didn't know  The way it all would end the way it all would go  Our lives are better left to chance I could have missed the pain  But I'd of had to miss the dance   Yes my life is better left to chance  I could have missed the pain but I'd of had to miss the dance
Well, so far it has been a pretty normal and not exciting week so there really isn't much to write about. Work went by really fast today for some reason ... but all I did this afternoon was play with cameras basically. It's   REALLY freaking hot outside right now and it is kind of messing with my running schedule. You can't run to far when the heat index is getting close to 110 degrees. I love summer and all, but it needs to be a tad cooler in the evenings. I going to have to wait till around 7 or 8 to run tonight. :-P I'm sure you can tell that I have nothing to say since I'm griping about the temperature outside. I just wanted to add something for the day. Well, as one of my friends likes to say ... Peace Out!  Oh ... read this if you want a good laugh  urlLink George's Blog
Well, its’ been a few days since I have added a blog.  I had a good weekend! :-)  However, just like most weekends go, it was much to short.  I was sad to see it end.  Nothing exciting has been going on this week so far, but it is only Tuesday morning.  Oh, I did have to go back to the eye doctor yesterday … $250 later I was on my way home.  That is ridiculous.  I know that it is my eye sight, and as my mother says … it’s extremely important, but I just think that is outrageous.  Oh well, I will quit my complaining about it.  It’s not the end of the world, but I could think of much better things I would rather spend $250 on, like new fall clothes (which I will be spending some money on this weekend if I can get my friends and family discount @ the Gap … I have to cross my fingers on that one though) or going somewhere fun with some friends.  I guess I should just be happy for being alive :
