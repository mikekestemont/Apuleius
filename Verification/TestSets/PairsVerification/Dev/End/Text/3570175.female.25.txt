because I think that maybe doctor's thought that because I was a student, I couldn't afford the operation I would need.  Indeed, NYU Health Insurance does not consider double vision to be a real health issue.  Ironically enough, botox was invented for my condition.  And now look -- we have a plethora of people getting plastic surgery and people who can't see super well (and I'm sure there are people out there way worse off than me) can't even get a stupid eye operation to fix their vision.
Last night, I decided to forego an exciting Saturday evening out and stay in for the night.  All I can say is, it was lovely listening to a Long Island girl who teaches English in Queens' life story from my window and even lovelier to hear the frat boy slumming it in the East Village point out the large rat he saw at Cafe Gigi to the girl he was mostly likely going to pass out on top of mid-coitus later that night.  Whoohoo.  I woke up feeling as damaged and irritated as I would have if I had gone out, downed three pints, and discussed my boring life with a semi-stranger.   I really need to move somewhere grown-up -- especially now that East Village rents are so overpriced.  Anyhow, besides eavesdropping, I decided to start early on the Sunday Times and watch some news.  My first try was Fox.  (I just rented Outfoxed the other night and made a conscious decision to sit through some Murdoch hell).  Anyhow, that Geraldo sure is dumb.

What's wrong with America????  What has happened to this lovely land that I love???   Oh yeah, and then I watched the Iraqi war reports and yelled at that too.  Give peace a chance???  Oh yeah, and then I was shocked and dismayed to learn that the Olsen twins are taking over/building a penthouse in a NYU dorm.  Um, since when is that okay?  Why don't they just get their own freakin' apartment.  And jeez, doesn't anyone recall that story about the NYU student who was so broke he had to live in the library?  How are people like that going to feel when they see the Olsen twins in their pad?  This is terrible.   Do people just not think anymore?  Anyhow, as I contemplated just this thought, I clicked to a different channel and rapidly began to grow scared and paranoid as the television screen blinked code orange at me and I was told to beware of cyber-stalking.   As I watched the attractively bland anchorwoman spout facts at me, I recalled my friendster profile and other such things and entered a restless sleep, haunted by death threats, war, and Denise, the teacher from Long Island's loud and nauseating voice.  Yes, I too had succumbed to the television marketing of fear -- on a Saturday night, no l
