is a populace of two plus million, teaming across four lane highways, living off shipments from ocean liners arriving from the remote ports in Asia. I had dream last night about this. Living in the moment....
Had a turd today the size of large banana...it practically tore the hair off my butt. One of those red-faced I'm having a baby moments in the work bathroom. I had a friend who told me years ago that it's always wise to take a crap on company time. And so it is. At ~10am, everyday, I grab the paper, meander past the receptionist, "good morning Jennifer" and slinker into the handicapped stall where I relax for a few minutes...or sometimes ten.  There, while I'm reading in the bathroom stall, I can reflect on the morning. Maybe the bike ride. How good it felt to speed down the hill from my house with the wind in my hair and nairy a tire to keep me upright. Or how this war is dragging on. How it's horrible. How detached I am from the events, because I'm living on the West Coast. Or sadness and hope for the lost lives and familes torn apart as a result of it's terror. The thoughts come and go, but all things lead to the toilet bowl. A wipe. A flush. And the tap-tap of my unit. A quick tuck--watch out for the zipper. Back to my desk.  Recently, I have enjoyed my bike ride into work. Today the heavens opened a torrential downpour upon the streets of Seattle. I was riding in tiger drops. They hurt my eyes. A greyhound bus laid up a wall of water that soaked me from the waist down. A mud puddle hid a pot hole. I hit it hard. It almost caused me to flat.  Bicycling is therapuetic in the morning. Each month, I get into better shape. I feel the fitness in my cadence up hills. I feel the strength in my legs propelling me faster and for longer periods. My lungs ache but it feels good. And pain is my friend. I embrace it as a badge of honor. I feel like the guy in the commercial that races ahead on his bicycle while the announcer voices over, "We've all felt like Lance Armstrong at one point on the bike...". I can relate because sometimes I do feel like Lance. It's fun. I caught myself this morning telling my wife, as I was barely awake, "I  have  to ride. It's days like these that champions are made." As I said it, she was turning over, but the comment stopped her cold. The sheets went silent.  "You think you're Lance Armstrong, or something?" she said.  To which I smiled jokingly, "No." But the reality is I knew better. I was thinking like Lance, and it slipped out. It's times like those the true colors show. I love bicycling.  I feel it in my bones and I hope in the future I'll be able to keep it up--to be a champion in my own m
