is a good thing, but for my daughter she looks best all preppie style. Absolutely darling. Needless to say we get some odd looks.    Well hell, I was supposed to be asleep hours ago, and here I am still awake.    I am kicking myself off and going to bed.
So there I am yacking at Danielle for a few minutes, she brought me flowers. We were talking about how funny it is that Cindy is turning into a fat cow, she made fun of us for our weight. Now me and Danielle are dropping weight like crazy. Our bodies have finally started to respond to our valiant efforts at weight loss and the results are more than welcome. Now Cindy, whom is much shorter than I am and has a small bone frame, weighs a good twenty pounds more than I do. Nothing pleases me more than seeing her get her just desserts. I am thinking me and Danielle will work out together when our kids go to school. It will be nice. I really don't like to work out alone. Oh yeah, back to the subject. My neighbor Carry was getting her lawn mowed by this guy. I guess he comes every two weeks and takes care of her front and back lawn. He offered to mow my lawn. Something I don't really like to do. Its not that I don't actually like to mow my lawn, I do. Its just getting the mower, weed whacker, and all that other stuff to take care of it. I have to drive over to get the stuff, make sure it has gas and then bring it back to my house. Then I have to clean it up and take it all back. Not usually an easy task with a trunk of my size. Putting the mower in my trunk is like pulling teeth. I was going to buy myself a mower, but I had a slight problem...the box for the mower wouldn't fit anywhere in my car. I could tie it to the top of my car, but then I would be all paranoid that it would fall off. The guy just wanted to yack my ear off, it was driving me nuts. I have this horrid feeling he is going to try and hit on me. As if I don't have enough of that. I get sick of getting hit on. It drives me nuts.
Talking on the phone to Beska, plotting and planning to have her run away from home to come and see me this week. I have a massive headache and need some Dew. I just got back from the store with dew, smokes, and a little bottle of kahlua. I may have to kick people in the ass, for not keeping their promises. It pisses me off to have no money and all kinds of bills to pay, and its not my fault I have no money. I shall be paying off all these bills and setting up a lovely fat savings account for me. Muh hah hah h
