or get pleasure to watch someone suffer.&nbsp; I love life.&nbsp; I love people.&nbsp; I love the little simple things.&nbsp; I just wish everyone did.&nbsp; That everyone would stop this hate and criticism, stop putting others down.&nbsp; To just take notice of others' feelings and consider that what they do is having an affect on others... ahh.... I guess I'll only daydream about this metaphoric utopia...la la la....
As of late, I've been feeling like shit, parcticularly when it comes to the topic of my friends--Alisa, Catherine, and Irina.  Ever since I've come back from Florida,  everything  has been turned upside down and shaken up.  Nothing's the same.  I feel like a complete dufus in their presence, like I shouldn't even  be  there at all.  Maybe it's me who's changed, or at least my views.  Maybe I'm not conforming with them just like they are with each other... I don't know, but it is really getting to me.  I feel like I can't talk to anyone about  anything  anymore, unless it's about guys or some gossip or judgements.  It's sick!  I can't have those intellectual conversations anymore.... pity. I also feel like, well... I don't know how to describe it...  I think I've mentioned this in a previous entry--I wanted to see the BLs concert...never got to it.  Last weekend, I wanted to go see the Flugtag, Catherine and I got there, and then she tells me that she has to be home by noon...what the hell???  Didnt you know it was gonna start at 1??  And you were home for only like half an hour and the rest of the day you just hung out at the bookstore???  Then there was the time when Irina and I were gonna go downtown Friday, we planned it like a week,  then she never calls me or anything... so yeah, that gives me a right to feel shitty.  Why?  Because I feel like they're not being honest with me, I mean, if you don't want to go out and hang out with me, say so.  Don't give me pathetic reasons or try to sway away from doing it.... gah!!!!!!!!!!! Then all 3 of them have this whole new boyfriend issues, which they are reluctant to discussing with me... I still never understood why...am I really intimidating??  seriously... why the hell not?  If you are reading this... please, answer me... what makes me the only person, whom you consider a friend, who you  never  speak of these issues with??  All I get from you is a  "oh, I'll tell you later..." (never do, by the way) or a "oh, it's nothing"  or "Oh, alisa, I'll call you later tonight and tell you what HE said to me"  Fuck...go ahead...I don't really need to hear anything about your damn issues, just do me favor and don't mention them infront of me!!!  If that's the way it's gonna be, I won't be discussing anything that goes on in my life with you out of spite...  Actually... I don't think that would even bring the slightest interest,eh?  That's a
