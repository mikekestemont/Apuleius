soul has suffered Under the constant onslaught Of fears, angers, jealousies these beings do emanate Never knowing When to shield, when to allow Absorption by my being And then the work of dissipation Before being engulfed For days By that, which is not mine.  And now, home again – no more Dense physical form Just me again Light, free, unencumbered No more consumed by slowly moving Cast-off intendings.     josmith, june 2004, limurian nights
My Limurian Soul  Oh how I long for you My distant crystal-blue sparkling planet You are a kazillion light years away And even more dimensions. A glimpse, now and then I catch In an artists portrayal In the words of the writer My heart does weep I visit sanctuary meadow From there I can see you clearly And my spirit is refreshed. The yearning will not leave me now For reminders you do always send of late The recent visit from home The smiles and love The regeneration and  encouragement That soon my work will be done And I can return.  jo

. A distant planet…far removed from here Many dimensions removed as well Not visible by current earth technology even if it were within this solar system as it is in a different space-time continuum than that held by terrestria. The beings of Limuria are pure light energy pure love…..there is no night-day in limuria. It is eternal twilight there. The reason being is the atmosphere of limuria is very hazy and does not allow the transmission of nay light energy. There are no plant forms on limuria in the sense of earth plants. In fact there are no animal forms either.There is only energy. The beings of limuria are loose energy masses..to you the earth being they would appear as ‘ghosts’ in the darkness. However they are not ghosts. They are pure love energy. They have no sex..sex is not necessary on Limuria for there is no procreation..only transformation. Oftentimes the limurians will choose to visit here on earth plane. They are able to do this instantaneously as they have mastered the concept of universal energy transformation through time and space which is non-existent when you are limurian. Limurians never die. There is no concept of time on limuria. The only concept is of love. When earth- based human feelings of anger, fear and jealousy  are introduced into the limurian being the being becomes somewhat confused having nothing to gauge these emotions against. The limurian does not understand why all beings here on earth plane can not feel eternal love for one another. Nor do they understand greed and game playing. A limurian is a very transparent being. All thought s and emotions from without freely enter the limurian physical form. This is why often limurians are private shy individuals. They are , however extremely loving and kind seeking only to bring peace and harmony to all situations for this is how it is in their home dimension. They consistently try to re-create home here on this plane.      josmith, may 2004, a message from h
