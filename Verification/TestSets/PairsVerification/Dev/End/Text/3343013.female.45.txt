my chest. Twilight is nearing, my baby, my dear. Stop squirming and cuddle in close. Nighttime is on us, my baby, my dear. Be still and you'll find you will doze. Contentment and cooing, my baby, my dear, are the sounds that escape in your sighs. Travel sweet dreams, my baby, my dear, as the shadows drift over your eyes.
'Twas lost, so she thought, misplaced or mislaid. 'tis easy to lose one's place.  "I left it behind, when the children were young, or maybe thatâ€™s not the case."  "I remember I had it at some family function, when everyone gathered around."  "It was near me the last time my baby was sick." Back then it was solid and sound!  She cannot remember just when it went missing. It hasn't been gone all that long.  But she knows that she can't get along here without it, Her days and her nights are all wrong
Lost  &nbsp;  My eyes don't actually roll inside.  In fact, most of the time they are opened wide.  But, when I take time and concentrate  And look inward in order to meditate,  I find in the gray of the pools of my eyes  The answers to some of my ponderous "whys".  And if I look deeper, nearer my heart,  My "whys" become "hows" and I finally start  To see the big picture and come to know  How I should choose and where I should go.

This garden place is far from perfect,  But is tended with my love,  And in this place is magic and faith,  And angels from above.  Come sit with me, in my garden place  And feel the seasons flow.  Come feel the peace and find your calm,  And watch my garden grow.
Catch me not up in the day to day rigors.  Lead me not by the clock that beats away its heart.  Leave obsessive duty and responsibility to others.  Of the rat race, I find that I want no part.  &nbsp;  Lay me gently into a field of grass and stately oaks.  Set my chair upon the sands that lie before the sea.  Float my aching self down a river wild and cold.  Make my bed upon a nest of leaves fallen from a t
