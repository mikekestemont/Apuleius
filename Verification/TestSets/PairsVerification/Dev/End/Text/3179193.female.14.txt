So if Wilfred and Will are reading this, THANK YOU for giving me GREAT comments and stuff~ ^^ I know what to do now and yeah. Hehe~!  Well, the *cough* problem still remains and I know I can count on Brian to help me out with it! [nooo pressure, Brian!] Haha~!   Blah, I'm gonna blog later... maybe.
Hm, I read Erica's blog and yeah. Re-read her blog entry that talked about my "over-obsession" with Nima (exaggeration). I've got a comment on that but you know what? Never mind. Don't wanna stir anything. So whatever. All I gotta say is:  think what you want ...   Talking to Moca on the phone. Haha! Woke her up from sleeping on the couch. She fell asleep watching TV! :D Tofu to the rescue! ...or not! Hehe ^^~ So yeah. Whatever. So bored.   I wanted to go outside today after school but whatever. My sister's going outside and I have guitar lesson later so yeah. Nathan, Caleb, Joseph, and Timothy. Ew~ Haha! Bleecchhh~ Zoe and Ingrid would love to be in my class, maybe? Haha! Ingrid is probably going like "Whaaat?!" right now but yeah. Bleh. Whatever.  Haven't spoken to Ingrid in a while. The two of us need to talk. Mehe! ^^ Mystery Murder Night. Might talk then or not. Dunno. Whatever. Blah. So yeah. I'll wear my COWBOY HAT to church on Friday! ...or not! I don't know... if I feel like it. Well, gonna practise on guitar for now. Blog later... maybe. Might not be in the mood. Whatever. Going off for now. I'll read Wilfred's blog and then practise. Hehe~ Bye bye! Peace! XOXO *mwahzZ*
Whoa. So much happening. Problems with [apple], [pear], [red], and Daniel Radcliffe! Haha! Yup! Daniel Radcliffe's the guy who plays Harry Potter in the movies. He says that he thinks Harry might die in the last book! Nooo! *sniff sniffzZ* But he's so cool! Haha! To be honest, I think Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) is better looking than Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter). Of course, I don't like it when Felton gels back his hair in the movie but he looks a lot better in the other pictures I've looked at it. Hehe ^^  *sighzZ* So bored. Not letting the [apple], [pear], and [red] problem get to me. [Pear] can think whatever [pear] wants... I don't give a shit anymore. Psht. Screw it.  What else is there...? Hmm, talked to Brian and Martin today about some stuff... I think I've decided something. Gotta find the right timing though ^^~! Haha! It was so funny during Science class with Brian, Martin L, and Martin Y! We played a game similar to Spin-The-Bottle. We spin the waterbottle and whoever it points to, the person who spun the bottle gets to ask that person a question and the person has to answer truthfully! Muahahaha! It was really funny! ^^ Those guys are so weird.  Something seemed to be bothering my alien today but he didn't say anything so blah. Hope that nothing really is wrong.  Well, that's it for now... blog later m
