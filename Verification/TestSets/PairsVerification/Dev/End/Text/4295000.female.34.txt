from another kia that got hit through the back into my kia...(its a sedona ex model...beautiful van with leather interiors , dvd player,moon roof the works..i saved for so sooo long to buy this van,my dream come true for me and the children).I was actually contemplating it,but than wondered about the warranty.Kia has a 100,000 mile warranty.How do I rely on this new motor??My car went from place to place with people not even speaking directly to ME in person.I am almost deaf and found myself Lost without my van...or ANY transportation for a week or so and it was HELL trying to get myself and children to the dr's.THANK GOD for Camille,who works for high point for giving me a rent a car...I do not know how my treatments would be done without that car.Anyways,Mr Appraisal and Myself start to joke around,how would Kia find out if this is a different motor..and As I am joking,I am wondering to myself,is this the NORM?Is this what people DO when you get into an accident and need  your vehicle fixed and appraised.Heaven knows I paid enough for Car insurance.Why am i getting the run around now?When I last spoke to the Man from Lacey Collision,he told me that "I" would have to pay OUT OF POCKET for a motor...a brand new one so that 'kia" would ok it...and warranty it again.They wanted to take my KIA to a SHELL gas station...all this had me worried,I still owe 23 thousand dollars on this vechicle and I just didn't trust the whole situation at ALL!   With the help of my mother and my cousin PEPE RODRIQUEZ who is an employee at Pulaski collision center(not sure of the name)...My van got transported there.LACEY COLLISION Charged 1100 dollars Or more..not sure to allow the RELEASE of my van!PLUS my van got released WITHOUT a HOOD!Where is my HOOD????   When my van gets to Pulaski in newark NJ..my mother is told that they feel that my van was damaged BY HAND!now this is getting to be a bit out of control.WHAT!Now I am feeling totally helpless..I do not have my van,My children CRY for the van cause they can recline on it and relax.ESpecially Ashley who used to watch her movies on it daily...and recline her seat when she needed a nap.This is all I have on the top of my head right now.I PRAY that tonight I can sleep without ANY interuptions.I should ask the dr about Ambien or something.I definately need to get rid of this horrible pull out couch we have because I feel it is not helping the situation at all.I will be looking into the temper Pedic mattress so it can help my back and neck improve over time.My knee is totally NOT THE SAME AND I feel pain right now as I am typing,my knee is throbbing,It feels like a pin an ICY pin is inside of it picking at it.This is the best I can describe it.Right now it is August 20th at 11pm. I wonder what tomorrow will b
