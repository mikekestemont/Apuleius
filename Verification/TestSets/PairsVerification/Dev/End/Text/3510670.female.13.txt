So here i am..(again!) Sitting in front of the monitor of my p.c & letting the time pass by me.. ano ba hinihintay ko?! The day of our flight in Canada? Or the day before it?! It's like im holding a rope that i can't let go, cause i know that the other end of  it are my friends,relative & "special" someone of mine that i'll surely ganna miss..*sigh* what a life..
hmm.. i really don't know what to type.. So, i'll just tell yah all what just happened at 'raw'.. They we're in Canada! it was damn weird!! awww.. La Resistance just won the Tag team Champions from Edge & Chris Benoit..oh yeah! That two idiotic freaks just won.. & i just can't believe it! But in the other side.. Shelton Benjamin got the Intercontinental Champ from one of my crush, Randy.. i was suppose to be dissapointed cause Randy loose & i don't even like Shelton, but i was shocked & a bit..happy?! hehe.. Know what?! i like Matt Hardy & Lita together! (don't know why!) maybe they really do fit together! i just hope Kaene don't get in the way! I just simply don't like Tayson Tomco.. he sucks!! He just broke Y2J's ribs..huhu.. He's bad!! He will pay on bad blood!! And the past episode of 'raw' was so exciting! Specially the part when Y2J & Shelton teamed up againts Randy & Ric Flair.. i also loved when Shawn attacked Triple H.. They didn't stop! hehe.. They just did when Eric told them that they'll have a Hell in a cell match! wooaahh! Can't wait for bad blood! Ok, so.. i haven't control myself from lookig for the results of Badblood.. but damn! Triple H defeated Shawn! i am so distraught!
I just attended a seminar about emigrants (check out the spelling!.. its because the man said, we spell it in 'e' when the person still don't arrive in their designated place & when they do.. we can already spell it w/ an 'i'! uyy.. nakinig!! hehehehe..) Anyway, it took the seminar for about 2 hours or less.. the office was so cold & very quiet.. Then, after the session me & my mom went in Glorietta and ate at Kenny Roger's.. Bad trip lang yung pag-uwi, cause the rain was so strong..
Me &amp; my mom went to Tita Ciony's place. We had pancake for breakfast, Then we went downtown. We went to a mall, &amp; it was cool.. After that, we went billards &amp; swimming! Then dad picked us up &amp; on the way home we saw a huge ship, dad said it was a ship of the celebrities! awesome!!
