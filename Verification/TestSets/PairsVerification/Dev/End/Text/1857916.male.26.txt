it back to Grady there will be ladder and form work for us to do.  M
Just wanted to remind everyone about the scrimmage tomorrow currently scheduled for 7pm at MLK.  We're trying to get Coan Rec, but no word yet.  Try to check the blog tomorrow afternoon to make sure we're still at MLK.  Also, please let me know if you will be unable to attend.  We should have the track workout up soon.  Also, we do have practice this weekend, 10-2 on both days.  Again, don't have a definite location yet, and again, please let me know if you will miss practice.
Hopefully this will be the last post of the day.  Most of you probably know that our own Amy Smith and Greg Swanson are over in Finland right now playing for the Junior National team at Worlds.  Both teams are undefeated currently.  Check the afdc forum for a write-up from Mark Swanson and click on the link above to see scores.  It sounds like they're both playing great.
From Lee...  Everyone must be current on their UPA membership and have a current waiver on file with the UPA.  You can check the status of both at  www.upa.org/members .  I have also printed out a roster page which everyone will need to sign and fill out.  If you owe any dues or don't have a current waiver on file, they need to be sent in with the roster page as well as.  I need everyone to fill this out by our Revelry & Rivalry tournament.  If we are late, our region could lose out on a possible extra bid and we will be charged with a late fee.  DO NOT BE LATE!
I'm not sure why, but I get the nagging feeling that not everyone knows the scoop on team shorts. Thank god I have the blog to dessiminate this kind of information so people don't feel it's necessary to ask me over and over again about it.  I need everyone's short size. Click  urlLink here  to see the shorts and for help on sizing. For the women, if you hate the idea of wearing the regular shorts, you can check out  urlLink their supply of women's shorts.   Email me what size you want, and if you want a different style (you may have to pay extra for some alternate styles).
Good work this weekend everyone.  We lost in the finals to Olio, a team out of North Carolina.  It was a great first half, but the dreaded army clothes showed up in the second half and took their toll on our throws and hands.  I think we learned a huge amount this weekend, and everyone seems to be getting more comfortable with the new offenses.  They both looked really good when we were able to run them correctly.  Defensively people got the opportunity to play lots of different positions in the d's.  I think we have lots of room for improvement but made a great start this weekend.  Overall 6-2 on the weekend, we improved a huge amount, keep it up R
