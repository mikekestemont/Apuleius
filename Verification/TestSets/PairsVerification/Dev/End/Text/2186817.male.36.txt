wanted was an unsalted pretzel.  I ordered it in addition to popcorn and a Coke for Jeff and a Diet Coke for me.  After she has the popcorn and soft drinks, she informs me that they are out of pretzels.   I suppose the pretzels on display are "stunt pretzels" and are not edible.  She tells me to come back in fifteen minutes.  I make my way to my seat and I have already missed part of the movie.  I wait 30-minutes and head back, wait in line only to be informed that the pretzels are still not done. I know it's not the girl's fault, but all I wanted was a friggin' pretzel.  I did not want a hot dog or nachos.  I wanted a pretzel.  I have already bought a $3 Diet Coke that is useless to me without the pretzel.  I didn't go back because I could not in good conscience trample over the people at the end of the row again.  The movie was good, but I cringed at the foreshadowing of the next movie's villain.  I'm assuming they will probably have two villians.  I thought Kirstin Dunst looked pretty running through New York City in her wedding dress.   Afterwards, Jeff mentioned that he found the dialogue in three sections stilted and awkward. I, on the other hand, found those three sections to be written very well and had marveled over the writing and the performance.  He had already made a condescending remark about my pretzel frustration and it just went down hill from there.  It was like he was George W. and I was John Kerry.   Jeff was on the computer for most of today shopping for a computer for the book store.  He finally found one.  We were supposed to go see Truth Or Dare at the drive-in as a fundraiser for  urlLink Out On Film , but only a few of us showed up so we went to  urlLink Front Page News  for dinner instead.  Afterwards, we went to Jake's for ice cream. I got a half scoop of two of my favorites: strawberry cheesecake; and chocolate leya cake.  I haven't read any blogs over the weekend and just checked my e-mail.  I received a very nice note from  urlLink Jesse .  It seems he printed out my screenplay from my portfolio website and read all of  urlLink Millicent Meyers' Magnificient Murder Plan  in one sitting.  I know it's 137 pages, but the screenwriting format usese more paper than a novel so you're really not reading as much.  I really appreciate his time and his feedback.   I did make a quick post as a guest blogger for  urlLink Ya Ya Empress  while she's in Italy with Chris the Great.  As a favor to me, keep  urlLink Gregory  in your thoughts tomorrow.  His father is having heart surgery.  Well, I did catch up on CNN.com for a moment, but now I'm off to bed. It's an early day tomorrow and I may not be able to blog again until tomorrow night.  I wish you all w
