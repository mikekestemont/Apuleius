fish, colourful fella. Had one fish stare me right in the face when i first went in. Freaked me out for a bit there. Shit load of sea cucumber and corals(duh), ofcourse. Had a laugh at each other, especially at Tanner & Cyril.  Hit the pool, showered, then joined the Tanner, Merv & Cyril at the dining area. There were sitting outside, having munchies & beers. Chilled out, gambled (blackjack) and short nap before dinner. After dinner, watched TV for a bit, hung out at the beach with Merv, Siew Mun & Lam. Merv helped finish the chilean wine Anas gave. Chitchat, took out more drinks & munchies, settled for more blackjack. Over-all, I won RM7. Before the drinks got me, and i dozed off. Yep, yet again. Yes, to teasings n laughter.   After gambling (Merv won pretty big, i was told), Cyril called it a night. The rest moved to Siew Mun's room, which i promptly crashed on the bed supposedly for a short nap. Next thing i know, he was waking me up asking for my room key. I went back and zonked. They apparently moved to Tanner & Merv's room to smoke n almost died laughing. Tanner got emo & almost killed himself, thanks to Merv *hahaha*    Final Day   Went to breakfast by myself. The rest already said they're not gonna get cuz it sucked. Had a quick one then back to shower and slept a bit more. Hung out at the verandah reading, then to the beach. I had to vacate my room earlier cuz are ppl checking in later. Dumped stuff in Siew Mun & Lam's room. Hung out at their verandah, then As' verandah.   Discovered lunch was not included. Went to the next resort to check out their food, came back n ordered off the menu. Merv went on to Perhentian, by hitching a ride with the next resort's snorkeling trip boat. The owner's really cool to let him do that, Siew Mun sorta know him anyways.  Checked out, said byebye to everyone and hopped on the boat. Got to the airport with hours to kill before we can check in. Had food, drinks and rounds of cards. Played Chotaiti, refreshed my memory since it's been awhile. Cyril & As went into the waiting room first, we joined them when we found out it was much cooler. Damn Terengganu's hot!! Played more cards n watched TV while waiting to board.   Reached KL and straight to LB to get the cars. Hung out there for a bit before heading back. Tanner dropped me & Siew Mun home, after food at Murni in SS2.   All in all.. it was a good trip. Very relaxing. The island's a great place if you're looking to zone out & not expecting loads of activities like watersports & shit like that. More foreigners than locals, so it's really quiet & laid back.   Check out www.pinganchorage.com.my for packages to the islands. That's the operator we used, call them to get the latest prices (which can be cheaper).  *whew!* Until next time... O
