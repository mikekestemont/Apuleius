forever! so the little girl was  right, but who the fuck am i to correct alice cooper???? xoxo
I cant understand how one person can make me hate him while i love him. i dont mean im in love with this guy, that would go against me being me. when i see his screen name im in such a hurry to im him, it doesnt make a diference that i know i'll be depressed by the time our convo ends. and it doesnt matter how i know that i'll be counting the minutes before he answers each of my ims while i answer within 2 minutes of seeing his box flash orange! ugh! i just wish that i would get over him! hes over me! he hasnt said that but my scary ability to tell has rung my bell! its just so upsetting! i im him even tho i know he will have to go first, even if i say i have to go i know i'll just keep on chatting as long as i can! its just so fucking frustrating! I wish i had the courage to tell him how i still feel. i wish that i could bring up just once that i dont get thru a day without thinking of him or that every time i sign on i get disappointed that he isnt online. ugh! xoxo
Some guy came to fix our computers...no, not just one, about 5 came, and the last one was in my room for 4 hours and i couldnt go in, the end result....i have internet connection, but alllll of my files, docutments, music, everything has been deleted...wonderfuckingful! lol.  In other news i decided that im going to start a diary, they are so much fun! ugh gotta go and make my computer mine again! xoxo
My cousins left at 7:30am today...ive stopped crying but i have this huge heavy feeling, i miss them so much. we had such a good time...they are the most awesome people that i know...and whats cooler is they are familly! They really are like my sisters...exept i only see them once a year. next summer is going to be incredible! im going to ireland with my familly for 2 weeks and then they go home and i stay on for another week or so. i wont go into details of all of our plans (we already figured everything out lol) but it looks to be a big drunken blur lol. and then fiona and Aoifa come back with me for about 2 weeks and we party it up la style....its enough to keep me going thru the year! Its so wierd, they talk about how much they hate ireland...i love it, its so comforting.   Besides all that im starting to get depressed because i keep on seeing all these back to school commercials...im not ready to go back to school! we only have like a month left!! i really cant be bothered with 10th grade! ugh!!!! this summer has been going by sooooo fast! its kind of creepy! toodles x
