guy, so I can only wish her the best and hope our next neighbors are as nice.  It's strange to finally know some of the background story after living so closely for quite a long time.

Then it was like someone was just whipping each droplet at us, and then finally they added huge chunks of hail to the mix.  About 10 blocks from home, I thought the windshield was going to break.  Lots of people had pulled over under trees, which really didn't help against the hail (now going horizontally), but it was impossible to see more than 10 feet ahead of you.  We kept going since we were almost home, passing a manhole cover that had popped off and which was emitting about 6 feet of muddy water, straight up like a kind of urban geyser.  The streets were overflowing rivers in spring, complete with rapids.  We went through an intersection where the water didn't go over the hood of the car only because we were going about 10km/h.  By the time we turned down our street, we couldn't pull in because of the lake in front of the driveway, so we parked in the backyard and when we got up the courage to jump out and run into the house, my foot first landed in an icy knee-height puddle.  And then, before you knew it, it was over, leaving banks of hail in its wake.  By the time I thought to get the camera, the water had died down to an ebb and the sun was shining again.

I had an ultrasound this morning to determine whether there is anything wrong with my breast.  I had noticed a change a couple of months ago and my doctor sent me to have it checked out.  According to the doctor at the radiology clinic, there are no visible anomalies, just denser breast tissue (which happens), I just need to keep an eye on it in case there is a change.  I'll talk to my own doctor when he gets the results next week.  I'm really relieved, but it's one of those things that makes you wonder, deep down in your heart, what life has in store for you.  On the ultrasound screen, everything inside you looks like galaxies and star clusters and vague fuzzy greyness.  And you know that your whole life and self and consciousness depends on all those cells getting it just right, all those little systems working in tandem to keep you, the sum of it all, breathing and pumping and awake and a
