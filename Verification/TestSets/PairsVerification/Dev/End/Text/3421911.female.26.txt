this September and i don't even know ANYTHING. Jessica Zafra, she gets to be on tv, radio, print media. she writes well, she's brilliant.  the only mean thing i think that she's had to live with is the fact her parents waited too long for her to arrive that when she was finally born, they actually thought she wasn't human (i got this info from one of her books).  other than that, what's her excuse?  i had a dream when i was younger.  i said that these people can think less of me all they want but their kids will be reading my shit  :)
i barely get to go out and watch movies. when i do get to go out, it's just drinking with my lovable friends or my fraternity brothers and sorority sisters. i want so much to watch movies but i rarely have the time, the bar exams being barely a month from now and i'm kinda short on cash right now, actually.  anyway, this morning i got to watch   urlLink  A Walk To Remember    on cable and it was really nice. i didn't get to watch it when it was shown here before because we were so busy rehearsing with the band for one of our fundraising concerts. i got to sing Only Hope. anyway, the movie was very nice. it helped me cry and feel more sorry about myself that i am unattached. the songs featured in the soundtrack were good even if meant that listening to   urlLink  Mandy Moore    would give me gas.  the song is kinda memorable to me because three different people were involved with me at the time and they all thought that the song was for them. (i am such a slut!!!) i somehow thought that i'd end up with one of them although at the time i couldn't really figure out which one.  the movie talked about Jamie Sullivan's wish list (  there's actually a book.  see?  told you some of the best movies come from books, otherwise, they wouldn't bother making movies out of them.  which reminds me, i have to come up with me own birthday wish list hmmn . . .  ), the first being to get married in the church where her mother got married.  unlike Jamie, and majority of the female population, i didn't have kiddie dreams of getting married, of picking out wedding gowns, flowers although i get flashes when i attend other people's weddings.  but the movie really made me cry.  maybe because i'm still bitter (  you tell people you're not bitter, they'll still think you are.  you admit to being bitter and they think it's their obligation to pity you.  sometimes, people, i think, should just get a life.  theirs are so mundane that they need yours to put spice to their sorid existence  ), or maybe because, i don't have a mom anymore, maybe because i don't have that good a relationship with my dad, or maybe because SHANE WEST IS SOOO HOT and he's kissing Mandy Moore  NOT ME .
