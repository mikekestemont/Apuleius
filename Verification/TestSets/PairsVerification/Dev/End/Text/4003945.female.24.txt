dress dark for a late-night movie on a weeknight). Now, I knew going into it that I have weak ankles, and that these sandals aren't the best for walking fast. I also knew that the first block and a half of my walk was in a less-than-brightly-lit part of the neighborhood. Pushing aside my common sense for the sake of time, however, I was walking briskly down the sidewalk when a woodchip that certainly had  no  place in the middle of the sidewalk suddenly turned my ankle, and down I went.  Well, at least no one was around to see me, I thought, a second before I heard someone jogging toward me, asking if I was OK.   Aw, man....  And all of a sudden I was face-to-face with Tom Tunney. But he was just too adorable--he was sooo concerned, which completely makes sense now, especially since he told me that they'd just redone all the sidewalks (which of course was supposed to make them safer to walk on). But hey, far be it for me to follow the norms of safety, right? Then he asked me where I was going, and offered me a ride. "I'm your alderman," he said, "Can I drive you somewhere?"  You know, I don't normally accept rides from strangers, but I don't think anyone would ever use "I'm your alderman" as a pick-up line, so I accepted the ride. We had a nice chat about people who don't trust other people for the two blocks he drove me, and he dropped me off with the admonishment not to trip again. (I didn't, thank God.)  So I can now say that I have met my alderman, and that he was a pretty cool guy. He's certainly going to get my vote, and probably a thank-you note as well. As for the woodchip, I found it on my way home, and... well, let's just say that it's not so mighty no more.
I'm so excited... my cat is finally back home! It was so nice to go to my parents and pick him up. I feel bad though, because I don't think he really wanted to leave. Of course there's the fact that the parents have a LOT more room, and I believe they feed him more, but also I think that the dog and cat have finally become something close to friends. If nothing else, I'm sure it's been great for the cat to know that there's always another animal in the house, even if the dog wasn't allowed to have the run of the house.  It was so cute when we got out the cat carrier though... not only did my cat run away to hide, but the dog started barking at us, and I just know he was telling us that he didn't want the cat to have to leave. For all that they seemed to hate each other last time, they sure seem to be friends now. Of course, that still didn't stop me from taking the cat back... he  is  mine, after all. :
