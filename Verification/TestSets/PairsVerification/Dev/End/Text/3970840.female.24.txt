she would often comment (I remember her saying this) that if anything happened to her, the three of us would never have to want for anything.  I just scoffed at this and could not fathom her, in her dilapidated accommodations and meager lifestyle, the type of granny who would sit on a small fortune until her death.  Besides, I wonder at my brother choice of topic for this our first real conversation in years.  Perhaps he was just picking me for information. Perhaps his intentions are genuine.  I guess now only time will tell. If anyone has any feedback from a similar situation, this would be a good time to let a sista know! Thanks.
Today, I am coming to you completely off the cuff. Lets start with a few updates for those who are following the soap opera that has become my life:  - - - Regarding JH, the smoke has cleared, we've called a truce. No one wins. No one loses.  - - - Still no word from my "suddenly" sibling. I left a voicemail. No response. Yes, I was definitely   PUNKED!

While the idea of being "close to nature" is appealing, the whole "lodge chic" complete with quilted bedding complemented by wood, wood, and more wood, really cramps my ultra-modernist/ghetto fabulous style.  - - - Be sure to check  urlLink him  out! Love the brother's passion for words and his sincerity.  - - - Me on an "I feel pretty" day!        More literarily credible posts to come,    I PROMISE   !
