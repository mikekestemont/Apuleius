by jumping away and saying "What!?!"&nbsp; The next part was actually kind of funny looking back on it.&nbsp; He looked at the Red Cross message and showed me and said "This is you, right?"&nbsp; You would think that would have been all verified by the time he told me, huh?&nbsp; Well, it was, I don't know what the hell he was doing.&nbsp; So, the Army flew me home the next day on Emergency Leave for 12 days, free of charge.  26 Jul 04 - LONG flight, crappy layovers, didn't get in until midnight.&nbsp; Still, nice to be home and see my girlfriend and the puppies.  27 Jul 04 - Grampa's viewing is tommorrow, and the funeral is the next day.&nbsp; I am a pall bearer.&nbsp; I have been a pall bearer for each of my grandparents that have passed, all within the last ten years.&nbsp; I am quite sure I will cry my heart out, since we were pretty close.&nbsp; No shame there.&nbsp; I wish he would have known I was going to Iraq before he went.&nbsp; Nothing to be done about it, though.&nbsp; I will put in an extra set of dogtags in with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a WWII vet that I am very proud of, so he will undestand the gesture. &nbsp;He went peacefully after a walk in the morning.&nbsp; He had struggled with congestive heart failure for a couple of years now, and we had struggled with his failing eyesight and hearing for much longer.&nbsp; Still, hard to imagine the man that used to take me and my brother fishing and camping is being returned to the earth.&nbsp;  I had hopes that he would hang on at least until I came back from Iraq.&nbsp;

We finished getting new uniforms (desert, duh) and have gotten cleared through medical.  Of course, clearing through medical meant 6 shots for me, including anthrax and small pox.  None of them hurt much, so it is all good.  That small pox is poxing up really nice, which is disgusting.  It is like a massive whitehead on my shoulder.  It should be healed fairly soon, though.

I will write more as I can, and I am keeping a bit of a log so I will more fully update it as the opportunity a
