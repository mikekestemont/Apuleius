urlLink    say bye bye!!
I know that you're hiding things Using gentle words to shelter me Your words were like a dream But dreams could never fool me Not that easily  I acted so distant then Didn't say goodbye before you left But I was listening You'll fight your battles far from me Far too easily  "Save your tears cause I'll come back" I could hear that you whispered as you walked through that door But still I swore To hide the pain when I turn back the pages Shouting might have been the answer What if I'd cried my eyes out and begged you not to depart But now I'm not afraid to say what's in my heart  Cause a thousand words Call out through the ages They'll fly to you Even though we can't see I know they're reaching you Suspended on silver wings  Oh a thousand words One thousand embraces Will cradle you Making all of your weary days seem far away They'll hold you forever  Oh a thousand words Have never been spoken They'll fly to you They'll carry you home and back into my arms Suspended on silver wings   And a thousand words Call out through the ages They'll cradle you Turning all of the lonely years to only days They'll hold you forever   urlLink Download here  ( right-click, save target as )
God,  I MISS YOU FAT GRANNY!!   I rode  home  with Ginger and Charolette.  I  HATED  comming home.  Though, the ride home was really fun except for the total dread of returning.  My room smells like:  dog piss , cigarette smoke, and must.  I'm back to my "white-trash" lifestyle.  It's not just the living conditions I hate so much...  I asked my mom for a new pillow.  She started screaming at me.  (they smelled like dog piss.)  She smelled them... "I don't smell nothin!!" she declared, holding my paper thin, piss stained pillow.  ...  There won't be as many pictures on cc.  (won't take any inside or around my house- too ashamed)  But whenever I go out I'll take some.  Also, It's SO HOT in this house.  It's "muggy".  The sickly air  literally  made me throw-up the first night I came back.  ...    I miss  EVERYTHING  about Fat Granny and living with her.  ... I'd get CANCER if I slept on the floor here...    urlLink     Charolette is a damn good packer     urlLink     me and my best friend      urlLink     mm cold coffee    urlLink     thank you so much for taking me home!   All and all, I've cried about the whole thing until I just can't cry anymore.  Life sucks without someone there who  really  cares about y
