did and I love it.
I forced a copy of   urlLink Start Something   by the   urlLink Lostprophets   on Mute today. Mute came home today from his friends house to find that the mailman dropped it off in his mail box. Mute said he didn't like it at first, but after listening to it for a while, he told me they had some good qualities. Of course I knew this, that is why I sent it to him in the first place.  The   urlLink Lostprophets   are probably one a band that I enjoy quite a lot. It is very embarrassing to admit this though, because of their "fake punk-rock" image they acquired. I don't want to like them, yet I am compelled to. Just like Muteman is.
If you haven't heard, on the  Viral Cartoon Show  Michelle announced that she was leaving both websites. She asked both Adam and I for our advice, and we both told her the same thing. That if she didn't want to be on the websites anymore, that no one was going to force her to do it.  I guess she agreed with us, and now she will no longer be posting on the website.
After hanging out with Sarah for a little while this morning, I returned home and sat in my chair deciding what I was going to do with the rest of the day. As I sat there contemplating my next action I saw my copy of   urlLink Kingdom Hearts   sitting on top of my Playstation 2. I decided I had nothing better to do, so I started playing it.  6 hours later, my foot was asleep, and I was two inches from my TV screen. I some how was trapped in a little world in which nothing but saving the world from the Heartless mattered.  Apparently while I was trying to save everyone from the Heartless, Abby was trying to get a hold of me. I should have heard my cell phone ring, when it was sitting right next to me, but I was so busy with the keyblade that I tuned every other noise out except the sounds of Daffy Duck yelling "Sora!".
Okay, so now the other website is gone, after lasting about a week. Abby has become friends with Ian once again, and I wanted to only focus on one thing at a time. So here we are again.  It's funny, no matter where we go, or threaten to go. It looks as if we always come back here, as if it is a secret mental meeting place for us. Anyway, that site is gone and now the three of us will be focusing on Kakutama. The only thing that hasn't changed in the past day, is the name of this website.
Looks like I am running Kakutama now. Ian has gone crawling back to Jackie like a lost puppy. So I guess I will run this myself, Michelle is not posting for some reason too. I think everyone is going against me. Oh well, I guess things were bound to go this way e
