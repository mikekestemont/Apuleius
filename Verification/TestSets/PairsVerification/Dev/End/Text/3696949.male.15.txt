but altogether admirable method of finding romance involves living by the very image of the sort of man we believe a woman would be most happy with: someone polite, generous, industrious, devoted, and anything but ruled by his sex drive. In a word, chivalrous, but without the sexism.  We, having no idea whether or not that’s what women are really looking for, nevertheless cling to it because anything less would be sacrificing our dignity; it really is an admirable lifestyle. People like Nice Guys.  However, no woman wants to date a Nice Guy, for reasons we cannot begin to comprehend. Some of us abandon our personal code of Nice Guy ethics in an effort to draw in women the way the bug zapper men do. But that defeats the purpose: either he has deceived the woman and she finds herself involved with a man different from the one she fell in love with, or he has become one of the enemy, abandoning everything he knows to be good and admirable for the sake of finally ceasing to be single. We Nice Guys are effectively hedged in by hypocrisy and the sense of honor that sets us apart from the bug zappers. We cannot have what women want without sacrificing what makes us Nice Guys, and we cannot show women that we are the solution to their problems with men without violating the same essence of our Nice Guy-ness.

Then the damsel, no longer in distress, becomes enthralled with another prince or knight who, however dashing he may be, would not have lifted a finger to save the damsel unless he was positively certain he could get use the act of saving her to trick somebody into his pants.  I don’t think we Nice Guys are the only people who don’t like the way this all works out.  And so, women of the world, I beseech you on behalf of all the Nice Guys in the world: take the initiative. The next time you find yourself heartbroken over the loss of another bug zapper, find the Nice Guy who seems to care about it and see if he doesn’t make a better b
