read a magazine I bought about the upcoming NFL football year.  I'm ready for my fantasy football draft I think.  Got a greatest hits of the Beatles because I don't own one.  So listened to that and read my magazine pretty much.  Found a Dairy Queen too been looking for one of those because I see their commercials all the time when I watch da sox games on my laptop.  Got myself a coffee drink and mmm...mmm good stuff.  Well, I get my schedule Wednesday so I suppose I'll post that.  I'm out!
I went bowling yesterday night at Mid Land bowl and it was extremely fun!  Went with a lot of friends who include:  LBH, da Bunny, Chaz, and Cliff.  There was eight of us in total and it was a lot of fun.  I'm a pretty good bowler and I wasn't doing very well the first game.  Found out I was a little off in my deliverer and was a little off from where I needed to start.  So the first game I scored a 61, which was rather awful.  But next game I made the adjustment and bowled a 120, yay!  It isn't my highest score tho.  I believe my highest score is some where near 142.  I almost got a turkey, and that was pretty awesome.  After spending that night with the most awesome person in the world, aka Lindsay Hines, I went home called her up and asked her out so yay we are going out now.  So that's extremely awesome, so life is awesome!  Hope yours is too!

Yesterday, as some may have known, was the Major League Baseball trading deadline and there were some block buster trades.  The one that affects da sox the most would have to be shipping away Nomar Garciaparra in a four team trade getting in return first basemen Doug Mientkiewicz and to take Nomar's spot on the field, Orlando Cabrera.  Da sox defence has been killing them as of late and General Mangager Theo Epstein thought that it would be wise to ship Nomar and his contract that ended at the end of the season somewhere else since he already rejected at the start of the season an extenstion to his contract.  Da sox also aquired a speedy outfield by the name of Dave Roberts who has thirty-three steals in thirty-four trys, not bad.  The Sox will have little or no problems with out Nomar in the lineup and look ready to win the World S
