the contrary;they love eachother dearly. They're very different. Very: one is painting and one is writing. But your poems are rather hard to understand,whereas      your paintings are so easy. Easy? Of course--you paint flowers and girls and sunset;      things that everybody understands. I never met him.  Who? Everybody.  Did you ever hear of a nonrepresentational painter? I am.  Pardon me? I am a painter, and painting is nonrepresentational. Not all painting. No:housepainting is representational. And what does a housepainter represent? Ten dollars an hour.  In other words, you don't want to be serious-- It takes two to be serious. Well, let's see...oh yes, one more question:      where will you live after this war is       over? In China, as usual.  China? Of course. Whereabouts in China?

Next on my blog to-do list: blogs I frequently read, so stay tuned.   I feel completely exhausted. But it is a good exhausted.  I believe there are two types of exhaustion:  Type 1) Sitting around doing nothing all day, locked indoors. This situation               causes intense mental cacaphony, feelings of insanity (especially if you've decided to hype yourself up on caffeine), and feelings similar to that of a worn out record. In my case the tension mounts where I feel tiny little particles swimming around in my bones begging for physical exertion.   Type 2) Oh the glory one might find in Type 2.

Kandinsky.    I was listening to the radio and they had a dream interpreter as a guest. A man called in and explained that he had a reoccuring dream of trolls chasing him in an underground maze. The woman's interpretation explained that he had problems facing up to his ugliness OR he just played way too many videogames when he was younger. How about a bit of both?
