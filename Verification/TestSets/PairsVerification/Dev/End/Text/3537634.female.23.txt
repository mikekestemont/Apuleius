a lot. &nbsp; I just read an article for lab meeting which found that the females of a species of wolf spider (Schizocosa uetzi) prefer to mate (and prefer not to cannibalize) males of a phenotype by whome they were courted as subadults. In other words, they're attracted more to males who hit on them before they were mature. &nbsp; Who says biology isn't fun? This will be an interesting discussion tomorrow no doubt. &nbsp; Time to write about productivity and species diversity!
The Federal Marriage Amendment got struck down in the Senate today. Hooray.  Kerry and Edwards didn't vote. They're the only Senators who didn't. Which changes their status in my worldview: they've been demoted from Flaky to Spineless. I seriously doubt this is anything but a tactic to ensure they walk that "safe" road of the inoffensive moderate: avoid taking a clear stance on anything that might potentially lose the votes of a critical demographic group. I'm sure there was some sort of schedule conflict on the campaign trail. The purpose of which is to win the confidence of key demographic groups of voters, which ironically includes the GLBT vote.  This is from their website: "John Kerry believes that same-sex couples should be granted rights, including access to pensions, health insurance, family medical leave, bereavement leave, hospital visitation, survivor benefits, and other basic legal protections that all families and children need."  All of the senators from my home state (TN) and current state (OH) voted Yea. I voted for one of them, thinking he was rather biparitsan and looking into his platform but definitely not well enough into his voting history. In hindsight, voting history matters a hell of a lot more than what a candidate claims to support.  The best thing to do to protect rights is to vote against bills that threaten them. Which Kerry and Edwards failed to do today. And so failed to earn my confidence, or my vote.  For more information:  Human Rights Campaign .
Back in OH after 10 days near and in Montreal, Quebec. May I say it is a beautiful city. The town I was in on the west side of the island was as nice as a small town can be in my eyes. The mix of Canadian French and English can be rather confusing, more so than my almost complete lack of French comprehension alone can be responsible for. Being told directions in English as follows threw me for a bit of a loop: "...take a left, at the corner, then the first right after the  d√©panneur  (convenience store)." Ack.  Learned a lot of spidery stuff there, and got to go to downtown Montreal twice. Went to the International Jazz Festival and the BioDome/Insectarium/Botanic Garden triplex. First time I ever just gave up on seeing all there is to see at such a place, it was so big! I know know my limit-- 6 hours of intense sciene museum-ing is where my stamina ends.  Well, I actually came here to work but saw a news annoucement I will now post n
