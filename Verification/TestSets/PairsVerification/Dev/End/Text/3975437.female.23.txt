came down to a race issue.  So being that I was broke growing up, I got to see the difference between the two worlds.  I like the poor world better.  My mother made an impression in my mind to be skinny and pretty.   I ended up anorexic.  Even to this day, I am psychologically bulimic.  If I feel that I look fat, I'll throw up.  I think it's ridiculous that it has to be that way.  The spanish and black girls that I knew were never told that they had to be thin.  They were told to "eat the rest of that damn food" on their plate.  It's a very sad issue but a reality.  I think they should make Barbie fat or at least realistic.  Maybe less girls would have eating disorders that way.  But we do have to look at it as it is...a toy.  There are alot of toys out there that give impressions to our children that could be even worse.
Damn this is a touchy subject...would you rather have your child feel restricted and as if school were jail, or take the chance of your child being shot?  I have mixed emotions on this issue.  My first reaction to this issue was that it depends on where the school district is, but a good friend of mine brought a new light to that statement.  "Look at Columbine."  That made me instantly look at the situation differently.  How do you make a decision like that?  What is more important?  A parent obviously wants their child to be safe at school, but do you want your child to feel like they can't be safe anywhere?  Growing up where I did, there was never thought to be any threat to our safety, until the riots happened in the cafeteria.  Or better yet, the bomb that was found in my school.  The worst part about the bomb was that the staff knew, but never dismissed the students.  Rather, they searched for it while school was in progress and kept it on the hush.  How safe does that make you feel?  It's the same principal as September 11th.  The airport had metal detectors and screening processes, but they were ignored, and the terrorists were able to set off those alarms and still board the plane.  That's just sickening to me.  So what makes a school any different?  A metal detector could be beneficial, but are the people monitoring it capable?  I think a good way to go about it would be to have metal detectors, but possibly hide them.  Have a guard at the front door, and something within the door frames that could x-ray as you walk through without your knowledge.  Only the guard would be able to see on the monitor.  We have the technology, but never use it.  I have so many ideas, yet I can't fully agree with myself on any of them.  Regardless, another issue still remains, if you are able to keep the danger out of the school, what about the other16 hours of the d
