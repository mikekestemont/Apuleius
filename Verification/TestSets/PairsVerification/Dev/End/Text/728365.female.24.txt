in Japan and it is unseasonably hot right now. We barely had a rainy season (which sucks for the rice farmers) and have seemed to fast forward into the summer heat. If July is this hot, I have bad bad feelings about August. I dont even HAVE air conditioning in my apt. It's usually not hot enough to worry with but I have a feeling I'm going to be missing it this year.
walking shoes and asahi. i'll always remember this day in shinagawa when serious words were said, tears were cried, kisses were felt, laughter was heard and a bond was created by separation. kampai...&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink
I have a new favorite thing! Today a bought a reclining chair and ottoman for my living room. I've been sitting in it since I walked in the door.
I've heard it all...  I have been too busy recently to keep up with the news but I am so glad I took the time to read today. While browsing through the Yahoo! News "Oddly Enough" Newstories, I found  urlLink this one  about German female officers who have won the right to NOT wear their uniform caps because the women complain they (drumroll please) "ruin their hairdos". Now if that ain't some Black people mess. I mean I know the German's aren't black but couldn't you just see some of the NYPD Black female officers being like "uh-uh, I just got my hair did".   Then there was an article about the strike on the tubes in London. In that one, perspective was the main thing that stood out to me. The reporter interviewed a few folks who were all stressed out walking to work because they were hours late, the streets were crowded, the buses were packed, everyone is stressed out...and then you have the word from the dude who works at the lotto booth. The lotto dude is like "I'm enjoying it. Seeing all the people walking around, the weather's nice, jumping from bus to bus...I just find it hilarious". One man's tragedy another man's comedy.  As my friend S. Mo would say "PIIP-Put it in Perspective"  Ja...
Hot vs. Warm   Tokyo was hot. No, like really hot as hell. Its been 30 degrees PLUS for the past 31 days. I didn't even get a chance to hop in the pool this time around. I wanted to go up to the lakes today but there is another typhoon passing thru and its raining like cats and dogs. I hope this passes soon though because I'm a friend over this weekend.  I just finished reading Obrigadabrasil and one of  urlLink Chandi's guest posts  that has me totally looking at my planner trying to figure out if I can hop a plan to Brasil sometime in the coming year. I guess she isn't an attorney for no reason, I'm totally persuaded. I literally read the post like 3 times trying to relish in her experience. "Warm" is what she referred to it as. I've never had such a longing to be warm in all my life. Thanks Chandi.  J
