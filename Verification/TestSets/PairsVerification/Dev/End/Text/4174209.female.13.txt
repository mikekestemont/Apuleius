truth, and, Sefina, you set her in the right direction, with your musical voice, but Cassy couldn’t redeem herself.” Cassy started crying silently. “There were only two doors left, and Cassy chose the easy one, the wrong one: death. That rode was a co-de-sac” The two sisters embraced and smiled. They were both sobbing. Both of their hearts was broken, physically and emotionally. But the were dead, and nothing could change that. “Sefina,” Cassy managed to say, “I am so sorry.” Cassy couldn’t look at her sister. She didn’t expect forgiveness. Sefina lifted a mirror, the mirror, so that she and Cassy could both see into it. The next phrase that left Sefina’s lips would cause Cassy’s destruction or lead to her redemption. Sefina nodded and whispered, “I love you.”
"My Song" is about today's world mainly - how it is  "good"  to be " bad"  in a way. There is so much pressure put on us by our peers and " friends " that it is sometimes too hard to say  no . This poem is kinda questioning what is going on in the world and the person talking in the poem hopes that she will be able to keep her head on her shoulders. Here is a quote I like, but I'm not sure who said it:  "If God wanted me to get high, he would've given me wings."  Also I think Carol Weston said this one:  "I don't drink because I want to know when I'm having a good time."        -Sharpie
This is the first poem of mine I will be posting. This is it's new and improved version - so if you've already heard this poem, i suggest you read it again because I changed it.      -Sharpie         My Song          Blinded by Imaginary Light, Forged from A child’s laughter And a burning tongue of Hate, Who is to blame For this misinterpretation Of right And wrong? This is my song  Surrounded by A substance of Shadows, Made of Something A nonentity A hidden identity Mistrust of thought Teasing And tricking And mistaking Weak from Strong, This is my Song  Forced to trust A wisdom’s enigma, Destiny’s drama, An hypocrite’s dogma, The delightfulness of trauma. A lie told and retold Till it was almost the truth, From Shadow’s Solidity Comes a world of fake Radiance, Nothing is left Of Moral’s honorable fight, Truth’s flawless face Is now a scarred blight, Worsened by resisting That Imaginary Light, And all along From Right to Wrong This is my song  What has our world become? Love is weak Hate is strong Who can resist? Who can hold out for long? Is this a song?  And whether I will ever realize the truth Or live lies Or even belong This is my song    Copyright in 2004 by Stephanie *********
