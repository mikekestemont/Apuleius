half every few days, and I need the excitement.  Or maybe I'm just horny.            [seacrest out]
No one posts!!! What is wrong with you people.. it's all here join and then nothing... why? BECAUSE NO ONE POSTS! Fred, I know you don't have much of a life so why isn't there some more posting going on man? ^_^ (I mean that in the nicest way possible...) Come on post!! You know you want to!!  This sucks more than a Hoover vacuum cleaner commercial.  Thank you and have a wonderful day.  ~Meishi (the one who actually posts)   TheFred says: Hey now! That's not very nice- the me having no life thing. I happen to have a life which brings up all of the interesting things that I post about. In fact, I have such a life that I forgot all about my blog for 3 days or so. So no bitching or moaning from you [I know the no moaning will be hard]. And I can take away your membership, so don't piss me off.
I joined and I better get something good out of it too. Think I'm kidding? Well, it's not like you could get me anything anyway.. seeing as how you are probably grounded. Great way of celebrating your parol by the way (please note there is plenty of sarcasm here). Hope you enjoy more time in your plywood prison. Look at the bright side, you'll have more time to blog, ^_^ and that is a happy thing indeed.  ~Meishi (the all-important one)   TheFred says: "Wow, i didn't know that other people could do this"    Mr Paulie says: Yup! Meishi and I can post because you invited us to join. Cool or what?    TheFred says: "Yeah Meishi, but Paulie's an administrator, he's better than you."
For all my talk of everyone else's lives being blown out of proportion, I think that mine is probobly the most dramatic.        Last night, my parents graced me with something I hadn't had in a while- freedom.  Yes, I was let out of my metaphysical prison.     All of my intentions were bad from the start, I notice looking back.  I sat in a room with some people to be left unnamed because as far as I know, my parents found this blog; and "adjusted" my mind for a few hours, then I went back to the warehouse, at the time that I was supposed to be back, with the cell phone that I was supposed to have, and my mom immediately gave me the once-over, coming up with the idea that I was messed up.  I was. So, yes, I told her that I was as soon as she asked.     My dad did the whole expected invasion of privacy thing and looked through my cd case that was bulging out from the center, finding a pack of Salem's.  Wow, that was dumb.     So the shit hits the fan, and there is much yelling and gnashing of teeth.  And here I am, unscathed as far as the personage goes, but scarred emotionally.       I need another hug.
