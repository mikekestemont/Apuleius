 songs are done I'm going into overdrive to get that album out finally.  Past the release of  "Off the Deep End"  is another album and new songs.  A more poppy album is coming.  Also it may not be just me producing my next album.   Oh my god!!!  Why wont you tell us more????!!!!  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!   Now that I've got you all excited go download the latest releases on my site:  urlLink rickkrenmayer.com
The mastering continues on the rest of the songs. We're almost at 4 songs completely done. I'm continuously working on them now. I'm hoping by the end of the week I have the final versions of the songs. Also we will be remastering all of the old  urlLink Third Rail  songs to achieve equality between all of the tracks in the final album. Stay tuned for the latest as we get the end of the mixing and mastering.
Well things are progressing with the masters for  urlLink Third Rail .  Recently I had to back pedal and remaster all of the tracks again though.  I listened to what I had and I just didn't like it.  I hate being a perfectionist sometimes because it messes with my schedule which I am 2 weeks behind now.  The weather outside the studio was just scrumptious yesterday.  With the remains of Tropical Storm Bonnie we had about and inch and a half of rain in under an hour.  Driving was fun.  Lately I've been looking at picking up another instrument.  Right now I'll call it the mystery instrument.  I don't want to spoil the surprise when everyone is finally able to see it.  I hoping a couple of months I'll be able to order the thing.  Now I bet you won't be able to sleep for months while waiting in suspense.
For all intensive purposes the 6  urlLink Third Rail  songs are finally done. I had to actually totally remaster them between yesterday and today. I like the way it sounds now. The band and I will just sit down to look over the stuff to see if there is anything else that needs to be fixed. I'm going to be remastering the original eight tracks also, but that is going to be easy compared to a full blown production.  Other than that Tropical Storm Charley visited the studio this morning around 7:30 AM. What makes this awesome is that I went to bed at 2:30 AM and when the rains started coming down and smacking my air conditioner in my room it was so loud it woke me up. We need the rain around here so Charley was actually welcome in this area.   My father and I have measured about 3.5" of rain in the last two days. Not bad since this is usually our driest part of the year.  Now that I'm pretty much done with the six songs I'm going to clean the studio and play some of my favorite Mozart pieces on the piano. I haven't played them in a while so I'll have to read the music all over again. :
