me with his overly tight-fitting toque pulled over his brow like and army officer, and came close up to me and stared very deeply, deep into my soul with contact lenses floating around these huge hazel eyes,  ‘ARE YOU PSYCHED?’ To be honest I had never been psyched before, coming from a country that is about as enthusiastic about life as a wet Tuesday in March. In England we are real about life, honest about life, and if we are honest, life is difficult and grim sometimes. People complain about all those grumpy people they meet on the tube in London. You try living there with a permanent smile on your face, especially when sitting on a tube, which at any moment could derail; such are the problems on anything public in England. Americans on the other hand are the most enthusiastic people I have ever met, pity little of it is real, ‘hi, how are you today? Great! Great!’ is a long winded way of saying hello in this country, to ask some one how they really are you must repeat the question, ‘no, how ARE you today?’ and just to throw people, I sometimes answer with a negative answer, because as we all should know life doesn’t always smell of roses, ‘I feel like shit today thanks, a splitting headache and I have the most awful diahorrea.’ Watch the face drop, and the fear appear in the eyes. The fear of reality. But Chef Matthias, although having grown up in some safe suburb of Chicago, and being partial to the occasional high-five is quite real about life. He is the most European American I have met. He is interested in organic food, small producers of speciality goods, such as the mop haired hippy who comes to the restaurant every week to deliver real cream, eggs and the latest unlucky animal around the farm. He is fascinated by the contrasts of European and Japanese discipline and works the best from both worlds. He also makes things happen, he is feverishly passionate about what he does, he is sensitive and delicate, but is also an aggressive hustler when he needs to be. I think his philosophy on life is all about application and adaptation, the true goals of survival. That coupled with the fact that he has the biggest and sharpest knife I have ever held, a two-foot tuna razor, and if anyone wanted to challenge him for the throne of ‘the fittest’, he’d cut you into the finest sashimi this side of the Pacific.  To survive in this little world of ours, we must fight to get to the top of the pile. If my poor mother heard this she would shudder with disgust,  ‘How did I bring you up thinking like this darling? Life is all about living, loving and being.’ But maybe I am just talking about my little competitive world of constant limit pushing in the pursuit of excellence. We all have our goals in life, I wonder what yours are?  Jesse Dunford Wood  12 March 2
