I gave it to her on our first class.  Pink roses would mean "I admire you.".  I gave it to her on our second class.  Red roses, well, I think you know already.  I gave it to her on our last period.  Didn't get the response I was hoping for.  She even tried giving it away to some of her friends.  I went home, broken, both in spirit and in my wallet.  I felt cold and tired, I went to sleep...  I woke up the next day with her apologizing.  I was stronger, and warmer.  That was the coldest Valentine ever....
This blog would be a response to the comments I've been getting not only in this blog site but with others as well.  The reason for not disclosing my feelings to whom it is concerned to is because of complications.  A diplomatic solution is needed before such emotions should be made public.  We must be mindful of what we say, words and emotions are forces to be reckoned with.  It has the power to set free and to destroy as well.

I keep telling myself to be mindful of my feelings and that a life of a Jedi must not be corrupted by sharing it with someone else....  Foolish was I to think that one day, she would fall for me as well.... Foolish to think that the heavens would bow down to the ground. Nevertheless, I could not deny myself of the fact that I really want to be with her. She may be "out of my league", but as sure as God made green apples, if there was a way she could see inside me, I'm sure she would feel overwhelmed....  For now, I cannot be someone she likes.....But I can be someone who's always around her and with her, may it be in flesh or in p
