next to the guy from Baltimore, an admitted nerd, who was dancing his fucking pelvis off...what a beast).  I've floored it down a hill on a golf cart with no governor (and nearly bounced los cajones into oblivion because the fucking thing has no shocks).  I've met another person who's double-jointed in the shoulders.  But I have never had so many things go well in one day.    To start it off, I had a morning shift in the golf shop.  Now, normally this would suck.  But I got to listen to 5 albums on my ipod (we'll get to that later), and actually broke even in the daily hold 'em match (I won, and then lost, 2 dollars).  On top of that, I actually got the chance to tell one of the fucking campers to piss off.  Normally, I am not allowed to tell kids, no matter how annoying they are, to get out of the shop, but one of them broke a glass pot cover, so I could tell them to go away.  Thus, with them gone, I could turn off the AC (which blows right on my neck) and just space out, like normal.  But this was nowhere near the best thing that happened that day.    One of my friends has this strange habit of giving out my AIM screen name (no, its not the handle in the hyperlink, so don't try it, stalkers) to random girls I've never met.  Don't ask me why; I don't ask (I just count my blessings).  One of these, a girl I had never met (most of them I did at one point see, but never again, so it matters little either way), but had been talking to since March, had mentioned something about doing nothing this summer.  So, I extended the invitation for her to come by the golf shop and go to lunch with her, figuring she would just find some crappy cop-out excuse to not go to lunch, or for that matter see me at all.  She surprised me by accepting, and right after my shift we walked over to the local mall, had lunch, and saw a movie.  And one thing my friend didn't remember to mention about her: she is HOT.  Really hot.  I mean, some of his friends are OK- looking, but this one was above par, even to my jaded eyes.  Even better, she mentioned something about some movie showings in late August across the street from where I work.  That's right, I didn't even need to introduce a lead-in to more: she beat me to the chase.  Oh, baby.  This is good stuff.  Thus the best day ever ends with me writing a post for all 3 of my devoted fans while listening to Slipknot.  Pure bliss.    Oh, yes, and for my birthday on Sunday I got an ipod.  Nice.  Now I don't have to lug around a huge CD player when I've got something in my head.  That's good stuff.  They should have invented these things earlier.  And that's it.  Good stuff.  For o
