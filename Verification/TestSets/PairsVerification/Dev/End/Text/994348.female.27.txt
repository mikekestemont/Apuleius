next destination. Sigh, same shit different day. Seems to become my weekend home. DUH!  In the end? Three full days for me to sleep but I just threw it away. Still have puffy eyes, dark circles and you won't even get to see my face in the morning train every morning: either I'm late as usual or I will be sleeping my whole journey thru' with head drooping low.  (didn't get to enjoy my deserving sea breeze too...)
SHORT-TAKE   I know the contents of my previous entry were full of sad tones. Well, I'm a-okay now. Emotions settled in and feeling calm. Finally, I have found out where our problem lies in. The point of realization helped to gain my composure back. I am beginning to smile a little now, getting to my usual self bit by bit. It's also partly because he has started to sms and call me again. *sheepish grin* This time round, it was amiable and positive. I guess that depressing conversation did played a good part. For now, both of us will need some time to think it over and most importantly, meet to talk it out. This is no easy feat, since we stay in different countries. Ah well, the trouble with love is... it's so unpredictable (but that's the wonder of love too, isn't it?)  It might be a blessing that I'm currently bogged down by mountainous work load, tight deadlines and endless meetings with vendors. And I just heard a piece of bad news from Karan. It's regarding the biz venture I joined not too long ago. There's a 'policy' which was not told by our premier previously and it totally threw us off the chairs. This stupid rule gonna make my life hard, cos it's like a deadline! Argh. Clearly, no slacking is allowed when you're encouraged to make money!  Right now, I'm strung out with so many tight wires... be it work, biz and relationship.. sigh, do need a break. And I miss the sea breeze caressing my face.  TGIF!
HOLLOW   Last night, I cried again. Couldn't sleep for the past two weeks. Felt so helpless with myself.. I sought solace from my sister in Oz. I cried louder when I read every of her sms replies.  Menses came again. It's barely two weeks since it stopped. Cramps are troubling me, it's much worse than before.  I dunno what's happening to me.  Just had a talk with him on the phone. It has been three weeks since I heard his voice. We TALKED. But it was depressing. And I sobbed. I hate to cry, especially in front of him. Tears, is regarded as a sign of weakness. I dun like to show them to gain sympathy. But still, I wept. Sadness is something you can't control, it breeds, it shadows you, it lives in you..as long as you invite it into your soul.  My world, at this very moment, is crumbling. I'm suffering from depression and I dunno which causes it.  Wish I'm mad. Lunatics enjoy a warped world much better than m
