because my parents weren't home.  No one was home except for me.  And I liked it that way.  I am definately not going to stay home for college.  No way.  Temple seems like a nice place.  Populated.  I want to do something with other people.  I'm sick at staying at home.  And I had hoped I could do something with Matt.  Just one more week that he's supposed to be here.  Maybe I won't see him ever again.  Or hear from him ever again.  Right now, it really doesn't matter.  I had good memories.  I wanted more memories.  But I guess I can't ask for too much.   What should I do?  What is my next step?  Will someone please comfort me?
Right now, I can't sleep.  I'm just thinking too much, I guess.  As pathetic as it sounds, I can't wait until Matt comes home so I can talk to him.  Just to chat.  I don't know what I'll do when he really leaves.  Sigh.  He'll be home on the 4th of August.  I was just thinking about when I will be able to see him again.  I hope soon.  I got into an argument with my parents about colleges.  It seems that they want to send me to MONCO for two years, then I can transfer to a real college after that.  I don't know, but the thought of living with my parents for another two years isn't very appealing to me.  If I do live with them, it means I won't have a life at all.  I won't be able to date.  Its not like I'll be making any college friends since I won't be in college.  I'll be at MONCO.   My mom says I don't volunteer enough.  Maybe I don't.  But I do volunteer.  I do orchestra "gigs".  I tutor people.  I help people in school.  I play for old people.  I play for dinner parties.  Thats good.  But I guess I'll have to do more.  So today I called the Montgomery County Cancer place or whatnot on Powell Street.  I actually want to volunteer there.  Maybe it'll make my mom happy and me happy at the same time.  Which would be awesome.  I plan on calling Target tomorrow and see if I can get my old position back as cashier.  Whoo.  Except not.  I really don't want to work there.  But I have to make sacrifices inorder to do certain things.  So I guess I must.  Two six hour days and one eight hour day.  Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday.  Twenty hours a week.  I think that will be good.  A bit too much.  But I can handle it.  It'll being in good money.  About $300 before taxes for every two weeks.  I can finally buy stuff again.  But I mustn't get ahead of myself.  I have to call first.  And see if they're hiring this time.  I hope they do.  Sigh.  I really don't want to work there.  I wish there was some other place to work.  That pays just as well.  And is easy to get.   S
