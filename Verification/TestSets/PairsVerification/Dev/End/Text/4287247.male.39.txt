go get it out of my car and it took me about 10 minutes and just as I was done she called and said she had already left.  I asked her if she was angry and she said no, I was going to ask her if I could come over but then I woke up.
There is something about me that just wants to fuck and suck my brains out.  I guess supposedly that's not uncommon for a guy but lately it's been on my mind more than usual.  I don't know if it's too much porn or just longing for more sex because I haven't had enough or because I have had more than usual lately.  I saw Bio Hazard / Resident Evil tonight, not that that has much to do with sex although there is lots of nearly naked Milla in it and several flashback sex scenes.  But, as I was walking home I was thinking how Milla seems so unhesitant to get naked.  She was naked on her CD cover, naked in 5th element and a few other movies I guess and often naked or next to it in this movie.  Any, that got me thinking of things like   According to the media lots of people are sleeping around  According to *common sense* most people are in a relationship, hence having sex  I'm 37.  From 18 to 37 (19 years), there has only been sex in my life 3.75 years.  What the FUCK is wrong with me.  Why can I not just go out and get fucked.  It's not even just about sex it's about having someone to share your life with. Go out with, talk to, eat with, shower with, sleep with, travel with.   Many of my friends consider themselves in the shy side of the spectum.  And yet,  D has been with E for like 15+ years now. J has been with D since he was 22/23, that's 15+ years. G has been with S for at least 10. D has been with M for 10. E had J for 6 years, one year off, then S for 3 years now or is it 4.  I'm angry about it.  Then, I don't envy D or J.  G and S seem like a great match but I don't envy them.  But, I do envy S. K seems pretty awesome, she's smart and can use a computer.  J has Y who seems like a perfect match for him and very cool. Very nice, very loving, very smart, very talented and has very common interests.  Today I met D and F and F is super awesome.  A TOTAL gamer.  She has all the systems, a huge collection, plays all the PC games and is cute as hell.  I've got to get moving!!!!!!!  I've got to do something!!!!
Because there are things I want to talk about that I'm not comfortable talking about non-anonymously.  I'll be honest, I'm not sure if this stuff should be discussed publicly or not.  Maybe this is what most people tell a counceller or something. Well s
