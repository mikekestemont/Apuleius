well its 2 days until i leave alabama. i made a huge mistake by going out with chris. see the thing is, theres nothing wrong with him, but everytime i think about him i get really pissed off. haha sounds like the ideal boyfriend hum? w/e tho when i leave here i wont have to worry about the little bitch anymore.   so i have this idea...i should shave my head and where a beanie everywhere, then i wouldnt have to worry about guys liking me, so i can be totally free and never have to ponder how to get someone off my back. doesnt that sound nice? id look nice and ugly and i could laugh at the people laughing at me =) yay.  i went white water rafting yesterday, it was bull. our guide was some chick who was all scared for our safety and tried as hard as she could not to let us fall out. last year, our guuide was TRYING to make us fall out. it was bomb...yea anyway the little annoying peice of shit got on everyones nerves so i finally just jumped out and when she came to get me back in i went in another raft&nbsp;and stayed there for the last 20 minutes. i left a comment at the main office saying what a pussy she was. should teach her. the kayaker dude who was filming us was cool tho. he let me hang on to the back of his truck when he was riding around dropping off the kayaking paddles.   i think i am steadily getting a shorter temper. im like mount st. helens, except when i blow up my head wont be flat on top, and no one will be able to veiw me from afar through their kitchen window in portland, oregon.
saturday night after ellies dad told us that him and my mom are getting married, we were a little bit mad. we went over to her friend sarahs house with a water bottle of vodka that darby (ellies brother) so generously donated. hes not mad, just morbidly amused. i guess ill have new siblings soon.   anyway i had half the bottle, nothing happened. ellie was drunk after about 1/6 of it. i wish i were a lightweight.  they are getting married on the fucking beach in fucking new zealand how fucking kiwi is that? chris is from fucking new zealand and we were fucking gonna go on a fucking vacation but now its turning into some fucking honeymoon getaway where us fucking kids have to entertain our fucking selves in some fucking lame-ass country on the other side of the fucking world.  fuck.  god i cant w
