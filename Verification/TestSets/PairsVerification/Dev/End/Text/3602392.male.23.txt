these are all true stories..........   An woman got in a furious argument with her 57-year-old boyfriend in their Milwaukee apartment, and tried to light him on fire.

She was 31   A high school science teacher in Smithfield, N.C., wanted to demonstrate to his students that if you drink too much milk, you'll throw up because of the acidity.

A court granted his wish: no license for a year   As a female attorney was arguing a case in a courtroom in Bordeaux, France, the judge surreptitiously lifted his robe, unzipped his pants and masturbated.

if the terrorists are going to bomb the dnc, then shutting down 93 isnt going to stop them. come on, do you really think if they are planning on bombing the fleetcenter that this will stop them? we knew of the 9/11 attacks and we didnt stop them, if they really wanted it done, it will be done. plus they lied to you, 93 wasnt really even shut down, they just said it was. i drove right through from randolph through boston and nothing happened, between the 4-1 o'clock window. a couple of exits were shut down, and they were checking any semi's that drove through. thats about it. they said 93 was only open to 'local traffic' whatever that means. anyway i drove through, no one did anything, all they had was a state trooper with his lights on chillin' on the braintree merge. whoopie.   as i said, if the terrorists wanted to attack us, it would of happened, even if 93 was really shut down. here are some other ways they could of gotten into boston: walked, flown, drove through the backroads, or taken a boat. boston isnt that hard to get i
