want to put a stop to it. It’s sad, on the other hand, because I have so much more to give and no one’s taking it. I’m ready and able and willing and no one seems to notice, and no one cares. So why should I?  I’m down with this second-hand emotion, this sweet, but old-fashioned notion. I’m tired of another “used to be”.  Maybe it’s time to stop believing love means having to make so much sacrifices. Love isn’t about playing the role of the martyr. It’s not about chasing after anyone. Maybe it’s time to stop thinking love has to hurt to feel good, that love is best understood when it is out there for everyone else to see. Maybe it’s time to stop believing wearing your heart on your sleeve is the only way to go. Maybe it’s time to stop believing love finds you because you’re not afraid of showing how hurt you are.  Or maybe I’m wrong. There’s nothing wrong with me nor in the way I look at love. It’s just those guys that didn’t work out right. There’s no need to blame love.  Maybe it’s just time to focus on me instead. Not as someone else sees me, but as I really am. It’s time to find empowerment in solitude, not to be cowed by its overwhelming power. After all we’re all still alone at the end of the day. So I guess I should settle with the fact that I’m just me, nothing more, nothing less. I’m not the perfect someone. I might not even be The One for anybody, but I am Someone, with or without someone else.
Even though I depend on words for a living, Sarah McLachlan inked the words to my life.  She accuses me of building a mystery and I cry 'guilty as charged'.  She said my love is better than ice cream, and I think of what flavor best describes me (ampalaya?). She croons about messing up and I imagine drowning in a bathtub for all my own foul-ups.  I used to think words are all I have and so I relied on them to speak in my behalf until I learned words were just weaker weapons than actions.   That you can string together the most elaborate phrases yet never quite capture the beauty or the sadness of a moment until you find yourself in that moment and you choose to seize or leave it.  Sarah talks about the violence of existing only for one person and I weave dreams about failed loves, weep for unrealized pursuits and refuse to let go. She offers me advice to grieve in my condition for not having the strength to say "I need you", and I am immediately thinking of a calm shore besieged by a storm on the horizon.  And when someone asks me how I am doing in the romance department, I just smile weakly, and tell them "I'm still fumbling my way towards ecstasy."  But when she sings about Adia, I realize that's where the buck stops. :
