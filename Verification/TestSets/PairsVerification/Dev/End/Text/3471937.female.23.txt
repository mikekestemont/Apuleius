do have a bit more life up on our sisters and we just don't want to see them make some of the same mistakes that we've made especially in matters of the heart.  Jay's reaction. Okay...my reaction to Jay's reaction is to tell Jay to shut up.  I like Jay, a lot, a whole lot.  He's a great guy.  He was one of Joe's first friends when we moved to Indy.  He even fed Mr. President for us when we went to H-town for vacation.  He loves his friends.  He really really loves his friends. He loves people, and if he considers you a friend well then he really loves you. When he and Dana went to pick up oil for her car the other day regarding her situation, he told her to "just do it".  If that's what she wants to do, he told her to go for it.  I just feel that he barely knows anything about the situation.  Despite the fact that I think Dana will do exactly what she wants to do, I just don't feel that she needs encouragement.  She doesn't need to have somebody patting her on the back saying, it's just fine that you want to go back to the druggie ex-boyfriend of yours who was abusive and treated you like shit.  Don't worry it's totally fine.  NO, JAY, IT'S NOT FINE, AND SHE DOESN'T NEED TO HEAR THAT IT IS.  I know that I'm emotional over it, but I just don't think that she needs to hear that what she is doing is okay.  And yesterday, he asked if we are having a going-away party for her.  I didn't say a word but of course my thinking was "why in the world would we want to celebrate her bad decision?"  I would feel like I'm telling her that I support what she is doing, and I don't want to do that at all.  But obviously, what I was thinking was evident in my face because Jay said "Karoline, don't give me that look.  I just want to be involved if we're going to do something special for her before she goes."  It made me feel as if I'm the evil older sister who doesn't want to do anything nice for her younger sister.  It's not that way. I love her.  I still love her so much.  Nothing will ever change that. I just think that at this point in her life she is making really bad choices.  I don't know maybe we should show her just how much we care and how much we are willing to do for her, so that maybe she'll realize sooner rather than later that she's made a big mistake and she'll find a way to come back here to people who really care about her.  Would that be the better way to act? I don't know anymore.  I'm completely drained. I don't know the best thing for me to do. I just don't know.  Ah, my sweet little Dana...your heart is just too soft my little o
