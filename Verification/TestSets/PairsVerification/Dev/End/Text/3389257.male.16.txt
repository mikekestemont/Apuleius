was also not a good day for sweaters.  it was a good day for ice cream. Woo, go ice cream. Apart from the chocolate ice cream, today did not go well. At all. I am talking german and listening to further seems forever. At the same time. Sounds weird, really isn't that more than boring. Further Forever are good, buy "How to start a fire" when it comes out.  it was good to see friends from school again. I miss them alot much. Simon and his glands. Luke and his beach boy hair. Sanna and her coolness. Sara and her incredibly small feet. There are more, but there isn't a comical feature ot match anymore. I could of made them up like simon's glands. I am too lazy. My back hurts. I played cricket very poorly for too long.  Well I'll be going now. I can hear my name being called in Peru. Also called in some parts of Uganda. It means something more offensive up there. Don't spend you're time looking that up. I made it up.
HAHa. Maths test tomorrow. It's the one everyone dreads. Group dreading. Wow. I think I'm ready, but you never know, do you? Circle theorems are blurry, but thats life. Scuba diving sounds fun. Anyone for scuba diving? No. Just me.  I want to fall asleep and never have exams again. Thats a far away dream. I havn't much to say, it's study leave, i have done little bar revision.
I had a long evening. I played with an inflated football till the early hours. It was fun. Got me too sleep quickly. Today is rather dull. Lacened with revison and none too pleasing at that. Science. Haha. What a thing. Science is much like Jo; It smells funny and makes me want to kick it. I like kicking things. If I could, I'd go pro. I cannot. The pay is quite frankly rather pantsy. "pantsy"-to be very much of a rather bad qaulity, see pants.
It has been a while. I have been sleeping alot. On holiday. I went to a party. It was good. Well done San. Not much has been happening over at Ol' fort Ben. Published more lyrics. I see no one has left reviews. nice guys. Nice. Seeta is here again. She mad me listen to killswitch engage. I think they're ok. Sorry Squeet. They aint the best. Sliced bread is still lookig sharp. Yellowcard are good though. Cheers for lending me the album. Thanks. You rocketh despite what you think I think. That made a whole load of sense. Don't pull me up on it. Well thats all fr today. Nothing new. As i said. Don't you listen. Honestly.
I am moving on thursday. Finally it is over and done with. I'm not happy to go. It's a relief though: knowing where i'm coming and going etc.  Anyhoo. Sqeet was here earlier. I was in a bad mood. I apologise for the assholeage. I'm drawing again. Founbd my mood. woo.  Just went skating. No I am tired. Suprise suprise.  Pain. Tired. G
