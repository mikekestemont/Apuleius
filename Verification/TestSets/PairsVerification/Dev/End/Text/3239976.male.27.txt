to a weary soul as mine  i stand in awe to the independence about me to the leader awakening to friendships blossoming to the new day to great and small things to God  and  i say today is a good day
i have a new book!!!  ross just sent me the latest book of paulo coelho, 11 minutes.  well its not exactly new, since i've been hearing about the book since last year.  the real come on was how coelho would be providing the words and prose to the a subject as candid yet so real as sex... moreso in how it would figure out when written side by side with love.   i am not so proud as to stoop down and say that i have yet to see how the two would be taken together and make truth what my teachers in san carlos have been emphasizing.  makes me want to just drop everything and read on.   i hope to start reading soon... in the meantime, ites is around.  and much as i want to immerse in my 11 minutes with Maria (the main character in the book), that would have to wait...
... i just can't stop writing...
after that mean declaration, here are some things that i want to remember the GA (and the road leading to it)  by:  "you        have to get your acts together, otherwise i wouldn't be surprised that if this happens again, that you would quit..." -- the coach "ang GA ay madugo at masaya..." -- cj "kala ko mahirap na ang alam mong marami kang gagawin, mas mahirap pala kung hindi mo alam ang dapat mong gawin..." -- sillyoldmebeingsillyagen "mabuti pa siguro, mag-resign na lang ako..." -- da man! "...nag-flare up talaga ako..." -- dugong "...ayoko na!!!" -- kj "pagod na pagod ako..." -- daboi "ang ganda ng exhibit niyo..." -- dinky (doo) "wow hitech talaga ng agri-aqua" -- aileen "kain pa mo ug mais con hielo" -- romeo's half "lagyan natin ng corn flakes..." -- meow "usahay...nagadamgo ako...." -- loloy "goodbye... " -- nay nene "nasamad- samad pa ko..." -- diay-diay "sniff-sniff" -- manghud ni gaga "bagsakan natin..." -- the coach "ipes may gagawin pa ba ako, antok na antok na kasi ako e..." --daboi "unsa man je, dili ka nag-uli?" -- melekoi "di ko sya dinedefend, kasi sa totoo lang naiinis din ako sa kanya..." -- the coach "oi ang liquidations ninyo..." -- igsuon ni daday "kaon ta'g durian!" -- wudz "o hi dan, keep in touch ok, keep in touch..." -- dom from da "nagkapoy ko 'pe, kay duha ka semanaha na ko'g walay tulog-tulog" -- geruncio "... di ko na kaya je" -- sillyoldmebeingsillyagen "tang-ina!" -- daboi "...ewan ko ba communication problem siguro" -- kj  some of the words said and heard, but am sure this GA would surely be a turning point of everything... so might as well remember it in its craziness too.
yey! after one month and one day of gruelling, fast paced action.  our GA is over and done with.  and the only thing i can say is... w
