for that!). Maybe the move to DC will open some more doors for me. Who knows?
Proof that I still can write  urlLink a nice, touching story  about a person overcoming a hardship....  Ironically, Councilman Salters had the same type of surgery that I did, so we've bonded over that. Remarkably, he had his surgery 60 years later in life than me (I was 15 when I had my spinal surgery). Knowing how tough and painful recovery and just  life  can be after this surgery, I'm crossing my fingers for him.  Maybe sometime I'll document some of the crap I've gone through as a result of my back surgery (pain, recovery, limitations, etc.) Thoughts?
Ah, the weekend that was.... I remember it as if it was yesterday (ummm, jackass, half of the weekend  was  just yesterday).... Yeah, anyway.... Seriously, just a great weekend that was highlighted by a lot of quality time with close friends from UD and PSP.  Friday night, I took off from work to Dewey Beach for some routine debauchery at the bars.... I joined forces with some beach-house roommates of J-Ro (my housemate and co-worker) and we hit up the Bottle & Cork for the Pat McGee Band concert (Joe didn't want to see them since he went to VCU in Richmond and they're from there). We had a good old time, came back to the house and I crashed there, capping off a steam-blowing night.  Saturday was all about spending time with long-lost friends. Lunch and hanging out with Michele (the Big) in Rehoboth started the day and it ended in Dover with Dave and Emily (who got  engaged  recently) and Jason, Summer and Rebecca at Smithers (ah, the old crash pad).  And lastly, today was the BBQ in DC at Joe and Ashley's new house. Lots of old schoolers there and lots of fun stories shared. Matt put his new squeeze to the test, feeding her to the wolves (us) for an afternoon. She gets a passing grade for now, but it's an "Incomplete" until she survives and entire weekend. (Dan's Katie passed this trial last year at the beach with flying colors, and we don't bite!)   Weekend lessons:     - Emily is funny as shit. No lie. I hadn't hung with her in a long time and forgot.   - I shoulda taken pics of Joe and Ash's new house before they start redecorating. It's day and night after they start tearing through a place -- paint, shelves, decorations, etc. They should quit their day jobs and remodel homes together.... they could have their own show!   - Dewey is the greatest place on Earth and Joe's beach house is heaven. Imagine 20+ 20-somethings all congregating in a house full of couches and air mattresses, enough liquor to stock a bar  and  a keg-erator. With bars every half-block, thousands of other singles moseying throughout the down and everyone drunk and looking to enjoy the summer, I'll leave it up to you to fill in your own blanks. The bottom line: if you haven't been to Dewey, you're missing o
