The following is an email I received from my good friend Adoree who used to sit with me in the back our friend's stationwagon and wave at random people just for kicks:  "You think you know. You have no idea.  This is the life update of Adoree.   Went to Boston University. Graduated with a BA in Philosophy and a BS in Television.  Move to Hollywood. Interned at Blind Date and Malcolm in the Middle.  Got work at TV production companys. Started at Pie Town Productions. Freakin awesome company. We have socials where they buy a bunch of beer and then drink it at work.  Am an associate producer for a new show (reDesign) for HGTV.   Moved into a house with my sis and her daughter Destiny, they are good (thank you for asking).   We are going to have a house warming party, which will appear on the show Party Starters for the Food Network. Will tell you when it airs. Gonna shot the show first week of August.  Playin a lot of pool. One of our leagues made it to regionals and won, so we are going to Vegas for nationals. The more we win, the more money we get.  Taking motorcycle lessons end of July with friend from work. Anyone want to join our gang?  Learning to play the drums (fun for the neighbors).  Love LA, it is awesome. Open invite for anyone to drop by. There is a guest bed with your name on it and a chocolate on the pillow.   Yup that covers it. No news on boy situation as usual. Was dating this french guy (hot) but he is off shooting some tv shows. Eh. No time anyways.  Love you lots.  Adoree"
