it has taken over a week longer than expected.  So I am learning patience the only way it is taught, by having to wait.  As soon as I know I will post it amid shouts of jubilation! Until then post your comments questions or recommendations for this site, I check it daily.
The title has nothing to do with today's blog, but as I just move to Santa Barbara I was feeling like "givin' da shout out."  So I am now in Santa Barbara, and I hope that those of you who are reading this have received my e-mail that my update information is available here. I still have not heard where I will be assigned.  To return to the questions asked in my last blog I would like to direct people to Wycliffe's web site on literacy at http://wycliffe.org/literacy/home.htm There are many stories and a lot of information about literacy work that is available there.  Okay,  "Why I do literacy"                   by Ryan O'Sullivan There are many reasons to do literacy work.  I first wanted to be involved with minority people groups in 1996.  I was interested in serving minority peoples who are consistently disenfranchised.  My area of study as an undergraduate was Communications.  I specialized in inter-group communication and learned as much as I could about group dynamics, identity, communications (of course), and conflict.  As I studied, I came to the conclusion that literacy (education in general) is a key component for minority communities, most of who don't know the national language, to no longer be exploited.  As I became involved with Wycliffe Bible Translators I realized that the work of Bible translation does not end with translation, but with education.  The more I learned the more I became certain that literacy work is a way to serve these linguistic minority communities, both Christian and non-Christian, by inviting them into the literate world.  Literacy skills are essential for survival in the modern literate world. There are fewer and fewer "unreached" places through globalization. Working within a people group, respecting their traditions and cultural heritage, and providing literacy through appropriate cultural models of learning can help intellectually inoculate communities from the negative effects of globalization, and provide them with the opportunity to interact with the larger world on more equitable terms.  For those people who are Christians it opens up the whole world of the Bible, allows for dynamic church growth, discipleship, and spiritual maturity.  For those who are not Christians it is an act of service that allows us the authenticity of sharing a Gospel that proclaims “the greatest shall serve the least” and a Messiah who stoops down so far as to wash our feet.  I think that sums up my position on literacy work.  If you would like to discuss this further please contact me, through E-mail, or phone.  As you can probably tell I get pretty excited about this stuff.   Stay tuned for more exciting updates.
