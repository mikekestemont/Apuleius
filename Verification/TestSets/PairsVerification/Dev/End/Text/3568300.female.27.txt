The new China Mieville book,  Iron Council , has&nbsp;at last arrived !!!&nbsp; There is considerable interest among staff, and customers, about this new novel. We sold a copy within thirty minutes of putting it out on display.  China will be at the&nbsp;our store&nbsp;to read from  Iron Council  on Thursday, July 29th. This will be China's third&nbsp;appearance at the Booksmith, as we had hosted him for his prior two books,  The Scar  and  Perdido Street Station .  p.s. to all weird fiction fans:&nbsp; China Mieville's remarkable essay on the "Polish Poe" - Stefan Grabinski - can be found on-line on the  urlLink  Guardian  website .&nbsp; (Won't some publisher bring out a big collection of Grabinski's short fiction?)  &nbsp;

Jacob Slichter, drummer for the band,&nbsp;appears at The Booksmith on July 27 to read from his music biz memoir  So You Wanna Be a Rock n Roll Star . "Closing Time" is certainly one of the great singles of the last half-dozen years.  More music and the Booksmith:  In the backroom, we sometimes listen to internet radio, especially those stations found on  urlLink Live365 . One favorite&nbsp;is  urlLink RadioLulu , which features "all things Lulu" - the music of the Twenties through today. Included are theme songs from the films of Louise Brooks, songs by the actress' contemporaries, friends and co-stars, show-tunes and standards, vintage jazz, as well as contemporary pop songs about the silent film star. Everyone from George Gershwin, Josephine Baker and Marlene Dietrich to Orchestral Manoeuvers in the Dark and Soul Coughing are highlighted on this unique station.   &nbsp;  &nbsp;
