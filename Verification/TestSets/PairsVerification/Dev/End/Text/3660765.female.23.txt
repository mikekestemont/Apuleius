still do this?  I'm in a serious rut...bleah...  Sigh the balls of life may not be as nice to grab as i thought haha
Jelly beans are good for health. There is something exciting about staring through the glass jar and figuring out which flavour or colour to pick. I looked into my jar last wednesday, and saw that the supply was dwindling, there were only the icky red ones that taste like cough mixture. GZ doesn't have a demand for jellybeans, so i came home to refill my jar.  A likely story, too bad i never had a jellybean jar...and the truth probably does more justice to the whole experience anyway. So here goes...  The cockies in my balcony were becoming annoying. I missed them when they didn't appear and both loathed and pitied those which did and suffered a slow death. And mozzie coils i burnt at night made me cry. And the construction workers flocking this yet-to-be finished condo establishment filled my dreams at night with exciting ninja maneuvers from this kick boxing chick. And this apartment had a flat veranda beyond my balcony which i always joked i would hold bbqs on, and could invite all the spiderman wannabes who could easily break my bedroom window to escape their enemies should their web fail them.  I'd rather not admit the worst part but without describing it would be leaving alot to the imagination of the reader. If you wanted to watch a movie, go pay 8.50.  The job was a dream come true. Promises of working visas in both HK and China. Travel to Macau and New Zealand and lots of meeting with clients peppered the words of The Boss. Well, since this isn't a movie we all know that none of this would actually materialize. Yeah, a dream come true indeed.  So it was the fucking cockroaches that did me in, and also the crappy mobile signal which forced me to sit with my head sticking outta the balcony door, and maybe it was the silly disorganized 'santa claus' Boss who never gave me any clause attractive enough to stay. The same stupid Boss who likes his crappy company logo that looks like a spastic apple eating bald man having a lobotomy.  So i packed up, came home and bought myself a proper jar of jelly beans filled with lots of different flavours, chucking out the icky cough mixture tasting red ones......
I can't see my own blog, i can't read other people's blog and therefore cannot leave comments. My guardian Angel actually has to send me his posts through email so i can read what has been going on. I can however post up entries but still it's frustrating...  So till i fix the bug i'll prolly post up some stupid facts incase anyone decides to check out this dying blog:  China's internet servers all have to go through the government, thus there are certain sites that can never been seen, ever. BBC and New York Times are part of the list, just to name a f
