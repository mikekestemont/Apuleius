the pretension of being scientific:   What do you see as complete satisfaction?  achieving my goals -- a phd, a career, a medium-sized office lined with books -- and furnishing the rest of my life with good friends, good books, my cat, and a condo with a gorgeous view wouldn't hurt.  Where were you and at what moment in your life were you the happiest?  on my couch, reading any number of books at once...i'm generally easy to please, but i tend to be at my happiest when i'm also at my most stressed out.
