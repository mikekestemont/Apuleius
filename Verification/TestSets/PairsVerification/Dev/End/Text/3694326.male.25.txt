forth! Must be hilarious for other people to see us big guys carrying out&nbsp;such athletic moves.    Walkabout again?    Not sure if I've missed anymore pubs out but we went back in here and whilst in the cue, met a St Peter's teacher who was decidedly fit so you know, paid her in but then she promptly dissapeared! Could have been fun!&nbsp;   However, ended giving it some seriously &nbsp;raunchy dancing with a dangerously old woman. Oh Christ, you always remember the bad things! I kept looking across at Keith and every time&nbsp;I did I was met with a "You bucking her tonight?" which I replied with a very slow firm shake of the head.&nbsp;   Some classic tunage in here. My Generation especially. Bumped into another workmate, Aaron who was completely out of it. We went upstairs for some reason but when got there we'd forgotten why so we came straight back down again.   Groves was dying of exhaustion&nbsp;in here so he decided to go. Had a mega barney with this old woman and her mate, in jest of course, and left to see if I could find the other half of my taxi fare.   "Grovesy where are ya?"   "Pizza shop"   What a waste of a phone call, of course he's in the pizza shop.   So he got his parmo I got a double rat burger off the van and we headed for home, bumped into Darren again so he joined our taxi and then this lass as well who heard we were from Eston asked if she could join our taxi as well cos she lived in Bankfields. What sane woman would get in a taxi with three blokes she doesn't know? Man alive. A hilarious taxi drive ensued, lots of tickling, groping and hair stroking. And that was just me and Darren. No seriously though we got her home safe like the kind gents we are and pulled round into Eston.   Now I'm not sure on the legalities of posting this but I had the brainwave of getting this taxi for free. I'd acquired £3.50ish of this bird and started rambling on to keith how he was going to pay for this taxi and that&nbsp;I only had £3.50. It must have been the drink as I've never done this before but asked the driver to stop and then legged it leaving Grovesy to pay the taxi! But KG being the ever oportunist legged it as well and we were outta there, free taxi home and £3.50 up. It can't be bad. Illegal? Probably. Exhilarating? Oh yes.   Spent about 30 mins talking to Keith as I walked the short distance home claiming it&nbsp;to be the funniest thing we've ever done. What sad lives we lead.   When I got in the rat burger came back out. Babes in Sherwood Forest was on Bravo. Passed out. Classic, truly classic&nbsp;night.   End of report.&nbsp;
How does&nbsp; urlLink this  work? Someone explain!! It worked out "ninja" for me&nbsp;so quickly it was mental.
Can any of our readers recommend any other blogs out there&nbsp;that detail nights out like we d
