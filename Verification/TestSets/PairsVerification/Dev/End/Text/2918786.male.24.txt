able to clue what the interviewers were thinking!! They kept smiling all the time...would have been easier if they kept a poker face...would have been able to notice any stray expressions on their face!!But smiling people??!! how do you make anything out of that?  Maybe they were thinking :  "Oh boy! Is this guy giving me great answers? I am so impressed I cant help smiling"   or maybe:  "Man! Such hilarious answers...I can barely control myself!! Think I'll just smile to put him off!!"   well,  urlLink Mangs  thinks it could be like this:  "This guy is soooo cute...I just have to keep smiling at him!!"  Wishful thinking...dont think that's the case though anyway   Anyway, got my fingers crossed...waiting to see what happens
Dream no small dreams for they have no power to move the hearts of men.      Goethe   Wonder if I would become a megalomaniac trying to do this? Hmmm....Interesting thought that...very interesting
Today I spent half an hour waiting for a traffic jam to get cleared en route to office...It was a pretty long queue with the line of vehicles stretching nearly a kilometre.. It was then that I realized: it is only in traffic jams that I get to stop  and think about things in general!  Most of the time we spend is in a race to get ahead of things... In school and college, it's a headlong rush to get good grades...After college, it's a race to get a job...once you get a job, you start chasing better jobs...bigger money...a better life...  But what really defines a better life? When do we ever stop to catch our breath and enjoy what we have? It's a restless life with our noses to a ceaseless grindstone... Do we really understand the purpose of all that we do? Why we go through this entire cycle of life?  I guess that's a question that's been plaguing people for aeons... But then if we really found an answer, wouldn't all the fun go away? Isnt it the quest that drives us?  Maybe one will find something close to an answer some day...
Overheard a colleague ordering dinner at office:   "Hello, Can you take my order, please?"    "OK, I'll have a half-meal, a gobi-manchurian and My name is Gireesh."    "No, No, I dont want Ghee rice!...my name is Gireesh"    "Arre yaar, I want just a half-meal and a gobi manchurian!!...I dont want Ghee Rice!!! My NAME  is Gireesh"    "Hello, Listen to me...I want the meal and Gobi and my phone extn is 3185. Please send it soon"    "Gireesh" to "Ghee Rice": Hohahohhe what a transformation  ( BTW, he spells his name with ee not an i )   Finally, the numbers did the trick!

Life seems so funny...   I wanted some things desperately at one time and try as I might, I couldn't even get close to those things!!      Now when I have let them go and have focussed on something else, those opportunities come back falling over themselves!!   I guess that's what is called i
