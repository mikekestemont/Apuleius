  Gee, well, umm, wow. I don't really know about this one. I eat  a lot , but I wouldn't say I was gluttonous. I eat what I get, and if there's more I might eat that too. I can stuff myself on WAY too many snacks after a meal, but other then that I am okay. The only thing I can't stay away from is ice cream. This is my most favorite food. There are so many kinds, and so many toppings. I could eat ice cream all day, every day, forever and ever.    Sloth   Ah yes, here's another one I've got to work on. I am one of the laziest people you are likely to ever meet. If I can't get it done quickly, I probably won't want to do it at all. I get bored with things and I move on, or I just get tired of work. This is why I have learned almost no HTML; I'm too lazy to take the time to learn it. I NEED to work on this.    Lust   I'm 13. I'm not quite in the "teenage boy" mindset yet, so I don't have this to worry about.    Wrath   I get angry A LOT. Once more, something I need to work on here. Little things get me mad, and big things get me mad. It's not that hard to get me mad, and oftentimes I get into screaming/yelling/crying tantrums with my parents. So yeah, I've got some problems with wrath. Well, why do you think I named this site  Grrness: The Mutterings of an Often Angry Teen ?    Greed   And here it is, my signature sin. I am one of the greediest little (female) bastards you will ever encounter. I want everything, but don't need much. I go into a store, and I'm all, "I want it. Give it to me  NOW !" Yeah, my signature sin, and probably the worst of the lot. Go Marsha the Greedy!    Originally Written on June 11, 2004
urlLink Random Inspiration    What could you not live without?  I couldn't live without my computer. It is my life. It is my salvation. Without it, I would always be bored. If I was a poet, and I didn't know it, I would write a verse for this wonderful contraption. Whoever invented computers, I salute you!   Originally Written on June 11, 2004
urlLink Blog Ideas    If you were presidentâ€¦  If  I  was president, which will never happen, the world would be screwed. I'm no good at making people do things they're supposed to, I know nothing about politics, I'm clueless about almost everything, and I would basically make the worst politician in the world. Plus, I don't have opinions on anything. What would the world do with a president who can't make up her mind?   Originally written on June 11, 2004
I hate all chores. I hate cleaning my room and bathroom, I hate washing dishes, I hate making my bed, I hate cooking, I hate all chores. I'm a lazy, no good rascal who can't do any chores, ever.  Prompt from  urlLink B
