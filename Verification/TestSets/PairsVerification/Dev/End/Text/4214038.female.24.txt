from one of my fave breakfast spots in Chicago. I then ventured out to the 'burbs for a friend's BBQ -- I could say so much about this but I will save that for another blog at another time. I will say that I watched "Dream Catcher" for the first and last time and I now know why I never bothered to see it in the first place. Two thumbs down.   I went home, went to a party, had a few beers. Left. It was a perfect Saturday.   Do you like the Spinners?  Once there was a boy and girl. Boy said, 'I love you so.' Girl said, 'I'll never leave you.' They grew older and left each other, 'Cause that's the way love goes. That's the way love goes." Then there's a time Seems like you'll never find Someone willing to love you Keep on lookin', you'll soon discover A mighty love Will sometimes make you weep and moan A mighty love You'll sit all day by the telephone 'Cause you're all alone You need a mighty love  -- "Mighty Love", The Spinners  Sometimes you need a little random 'ol school in ya life.   ~*RBG*~
My line sister and I are having our neophyte celebration Friday, August 20 at 7 p.m.   For more info, contact me directly or post an express of interest in joining us for the party, and I will hit you back.   Bring a friend and tell the friend to bring a gift. :) OR just wish me happy crossing! OR ... you know ... *scratches head* do both.  ~*RBG*~
OK, so tomorrow I head to my hometown of Chicago (Illinois, that is) for Blue and White Weekend. I'm hella excited because it's my first ever! For those who may not know what the hell I'm talking about... I am a member of the Illustrious Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, IIIIIINNNNCORPORATED. And every year throughout the country, my Sorority and our brother Fraternity, Phi Beta Sigma, hosts many Blue and White weekends/weeks in their area of the United States. For instance, there's one in Chicago this weekend and one in Pittsburgh and the DC area next weekend (though I unfortunately won't be in attendance for either of those). *whisper* My neophyte is next weekend!   Will YOU be at B&W weekend? Are you in a fraternity or sorority? Which one? Have positive/negative feelings about fraternities and sororities? Share a story.  Want to join a fraternity or sorority but got questions?  Post away if you like, otherwise I will tell you about my endeavors when I return. YAY! Road Trip!  ~*RBG*~
Not sure how you found me, but thanks for stopping by. I was given the idea to start a blog today ... so I did. It may turn out to be a hit or miss *shrug* who really knows. I will discuss things that float around in my head and if you feel they are meaningful or even if ya don't, reply. It'll be fun ... really.   Till the first actual post ... adieu, ciao and adios ... you know, laterz.  ~
