My shift ended at around 5am this morning, and after eating brunch with a couple of friends, went home at around 12, was not able to get sleep right away cuz got some visitors a home. the boogieman visited me at around 3pm and my clock shouted at me at around 5pm... but still i was able to find energy to pull myself up and go to work. funny though, i know that am so tired and all but still i feel so high, my energy level is way up on ten... why do i feel so perky perky today? am i trying to hide something? i know deep down inside me i am covering up for something.. i am in denial, i just wanna look happy but i know am not... this is hard but i am enjoying it, it makes me look stupid and it makes me feel weak, i know i am weak, i am a coward, i am nothing... aaaaaarrrrgggghhh!! i dont wanna feel so damn depressed so i guess i'll just go on with this "joke" i have going on..
Love is never easy, butIt turns life into song.   There is no bit of circumstanceThat love cannot transform.    There is no weary momentOf anger or despair   That love cannot convert to graceAnd render whole and fair.    How passionate the paradiseThat comes from knowing wellThat someone in your happinessFinds pleasure for himself.    How sweet the gift of giving toSomeone who gives to you,   A selflessness that gives to self   More self than self is due.    With all the searing madness ofThe world from day to day,   And all the dreary sadness thatNo joy can take away,    There is one truth more beautifulThan anyone can bear:   That two can trust that when they turn   They'll find the other there.
Through the fireTo the limit,      to the wall     For a chance to be with youI’d gladly risk it all     Through the fire     Through whatever,      come what may     For a chance at loving youI’d take it all the way     Right down to the wire     Even through the fire
