rocks...but don't limit yourself:)...U'll always fall short with Stupid rules.  Just live by the spirit and let the holy spirit decide choices for u.  Thinking bout it that way I think it's rad cuz it's almost like God is making decisions for u:D haha that's awesome.  Haha he could make u something way better than u make yourself.  Give ur all to him.  Don't be afraid:)...that's what Satan wants.  Don't give in to the thought that God doesn't have ur best intentions in mind.  God bless u:)and if could comment that'd be great...And if u comment I'd like it alot if u put your name to it:)
Oh man it was awesome outside today:D!!! It was soo sunny and beautiful:).  I got out early today and soo I just basically did homework till lunch time then I went out to mcdonalds and then came back and did more hw:P.  I'm really trying to boost my marks up in this final stretch and do all the assignments I've missed.  I've been pretty busy with that and I've been kinda tired from staying up too late:P.  Life with God is pretty good...I've told about what I want and who I want to be in Christ and now I haveta walk it out.  Reflecting Christ's image is tough cuz man he's perfect...but that's kinda my aim to just have Jesus written all over me:).  I've said this lots like who I wanna be in christ...but I haveta fully take action and just give my all.  Sometimes It's hard to give ur all and I'm really working on it.  Satan just grips us with fear:S and he's makes us pretend to be things we're not and makes us live in insecurity and fear of our future.  Giving your all to God frees us from the fear and being afraid what's goin to happen.  Man...ANother thing that's kinda bumming me out is how fake everyone is:( It's just soo lame.  I just rather people be who they really r and not put on fronts.  I rather people not say they're christians if they don't even want God until like it's uth group or something and they put on a front "o I'm tight with God" but really they're not close to God at all.  People all deserve a chance don't get me wrong...but if u rn't even trying there's no point in faking it.  Live life like there's no tomorrow.  Do this thing for Christ:).  Be the real u whoever that might be.  Don't feel pressured into christianity.  If ur not real about it either get real or just be the person who u really are acting like out of church and out of the christian groups.  Be the person u'd be like when u hang out with Non- christians...cuz then that's more where ur heart is and it's less fake.  I want u guys to all go for God.  But be real:)  God bless u all and guys if u ever need prayer I'll pray for anyone just send me prayer requests or something:D take c
