The Reaper. “Hey, yall are ye hearin that?” asked Jade. “Yea Jade I hear it, it sounds very familiar.” Said the Captain.  “I am very sure you recognize the sound of what you call The Reaper.” Informed Zet. “We are all aware they not one person has faced one of these things and lived?” said Jones. “Yea, so what do you mean?” asked the Captain. “I’m just saying WE ARE STILL STANDING HERE!” he screamed. At that moment The Reaper became visible, and they had no chance of escape. It passed straight through the group and they were all dead in seconds. Before he died the Captain asked Zet to continue their fight. He graciously agrees. As the Reaper passes through Zet leaped onto the back of the mech and lashed out at its circuits automatically shutting it down. They fell to the ground and he began rushing in the direction of the main Over Mind of the mechs M A R C H 3 1, 5 0 9 3   He reached the Over Mind within a few days. When he got there he was met by a defensive wall of hovTANKs. They were no match for him. He destroyed them all with an extreme pittance of work. It does not take Zet long to find and infiltrate the Over Mind compound. After he was inside Zet was ready to plug into the computers when he sensed something……..something right behind him. He turned around to find a Reaper. One thing was different about this reaper. It was a new model fresh off the assembly line. He had no idea how to deal with it, and saw no weaknesses. Zet then noticed he was standing inside the Over Mind. If he was damaged it was possible to self-destruct and wipe out the Mech center. He lunged straight into battle with the Reaper. Instantly it severed his left arm and pinned him to the floor. Just flailing out Zet hit the reaper on a small plate in the middle of its chest, exposing its central power core. Snatching it the Reaper was shutdown. He had done it. Zet crawled out from under the mech and plugged into the computers. He then took control of the Over Mind and all machines were under his control. Zet was the mechs now. Seconds after he plugged in he saw the entire human race was already gone. The Captain and his crew were the last surviving humans. So from then on he just spread and populated the entire earth. Well he did not stop there, ZeTrappLaxicaNtrellador875341 spread mechism to all planets and explored the unknown. Finding and living along side other very intelligent alien life.
