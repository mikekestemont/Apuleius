nice body kit and some other goodies for the Eclipse grew stronger today. Hopefully, my motivation will last.  Oh, and I went to a gas station to buy a pair of sunglasses, and that cute girl I've seen working there a couple of times before was working. I asked her for advice on what pair of sunglasses to buy, decided on a pair and she gave me a nice discount. Nice girl.
Ok, there are computer games that can make you a wee bit nervous while playing it. There are even computer games that can make you on edge. I'm telling you, though; running Doom 3 on a nice, big TV, accompanied by a complete surround sound audio setup in a small, dark room makes my heart pound and my stomach turn upside down.

Arrived some time between 20 and 21, finding all the attending people gathered around a table on the front lawn. We played some games, drank some beverages of varying sorts and quality, smoked a lot of cigarettes and had a generally good time. At around 23 we decided to move the party inside, where we played more games, drank more beverages, smoked more cigarettes and kept having a good time. After a couple of more hours I started feeling it was time for me to go home, and since Magnus was about to leave I bummed a ride with him, dropping by Shell on the way to buy some food for tomorrow.  Now I'm at home, lonely and sad. If I would have had anything to say about my current situation, I could have been less sober or less lonely, but as usual I'm home relatively early, quite sober and all alone.
