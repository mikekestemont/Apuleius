(their view on things, naturally). As they were not willing to give up their perfect, airborne lives- they instead decided on another course.  And so the wars between heaven and earth began. If they could conquer the people who had remained upon the earth- they could take resources for their cities any time they wished. perhaps even take those who didn't have strong magical talents to truly make their lives utter perfection for all those in the aerial cities: take slaves who would do the menial, unpleasant, and occasionally dangerous tasks for them.  If they ruled the surface, after all, where could such people hope to escape to?  For the people below- the aerial cities were an insult to nature itself- abominations that should be destroyed. Now that fate has allowed them to clash, starting with the fall of one city and subsequence slaughter of it's inhabitants by the ground-dwellers, they are readying their own weapons....  But science is of human nature- and some are not so sure that bringing the natural against the human-natural is such a good idea. Humans have raised above animals by learning how not only to exist with nature- but to move past it's primal cycles as well. What weapons they have- those of the cities may know how to defeat. So some have drawn back to watch..worried and apprehensive...and with good cause. Aerial cities are hard targets to reach...  Especially when they themselves are armed with terrible weapons to rain death down on people long before they realize what is hiding above the clouds. As a result, the mages have started altering weather to try to force the citadels down- but they fly well above cloud height usually...far beyond the reach of a mere storm.  Thus the world has begun to enter a dark age with the surface world being torn apart bit by bit by wild storms and devastating aerial attacks...it will only end when one side finally wins...or they somehow call a truce.  Some places have given in to the cities and act as spies in hopes of earning a place other than as slaves.  some within the cities feel what they are doing is wrong, however. They do think the people of the ground little better than beasts...but even beasts should be treated well..not beaten into submission....  ----  Yes I know. lacking actual STORY...but..we all know /background/ story is my strong point. ^_^;
Just checking to see if this works. ^_^ I'll be using this to post my own personal random musings, story ideas (well background ideas in my case.), so on and so forth.  So if I invited ya here- welcome! If not- scram. =P I'm not friendly and never claimed to be.
Isn't it strange how silly our society is when you actually look at it? Our entirely world wide economy is based on a metal that hasn't even been particuarly useful, just pretty to look at according to most people, and only recently had any kind of value beyond it's looks.  Pretty weird when you actually stop to think about i
