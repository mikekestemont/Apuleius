to cover up. With all might I exhaust all my strength yet the closet remained closed.  Trembling in confusion, I was trapped.  Then I looked back, my sleeping image was still there, motionless and it seemed not to be breathing.  I then quickly returned my gaze back to the closet and saw something else. Something far more terrifying…  In front of me was a loaded 48-caliber revolver floating at midair.  A knot of fear made my chest ache as I watched the gun drifting near me. Its nozzle was pointing directly at my temple, ready to fire anytime.  I went stiff cold. Blood was pounding in my ears as I strained to hear the gun clicked. I finally recovered my power of speech.  “No!” My frantic scream was strangled as I heard another “click” from the gun’s revolver.  “Listen to me. Please have mercy!” I cried out, terrified by the sound.  “I don’t want to die. Let me go back!” I begged wildly. But it was too late and before I knew it…I heard gunshots.  Bang!...Bang!  Heavy smoke lingered in the air. For seconds, there was a miasma of sickening sadness floating around the room.  My head fell back limply and blood began to run from the back of my scalp. A low scream tore from my throat, then my gaze froze in terror on the sight of blood streaming on the pieces of broken mirror scattered across the floor. I crumpled to the floor, my shoulders racked in deep choking sobs.  “ Why won’t you listen to me?” The thought echoed through my mind, my body slowly turned into fog as I began to fade away…   The sky was streaked with a crimson sunset.  Tears slowly swelled from the corners of my eyes as I blankly stared at the ceiling above my bed. There was a shadowy void as dismal as my heart as I went over to the death scene with my invisible assassin.  I felt the sharp stab of anguish that shot through me.  Exhausted, I rolled onto my stomach. Despite the dull ache I began to remind myself to breathe. I picked up my pillow and wrapped my arms around it and hugged it to my chest, feeling every beat of my heart.  “It was just a nightmare.” I said softly.  I got up and went to the kitchen to get some water. Seated near the dinning table, was papa silently reading a book. He looked at me, acknowledging my presence and asked why I was awake.  “It’s three in the afternoon, aren’t you suppose to wake up at seven-thirty?” he asked.  “I woke up cause I thought I heard gunshots” I replied  “Gunshots? Could be just a dream, darling.” He said assumingly.  “Okay” I said numbly.  “Then get some rest afterwards, I’ll wake you up when its time.” He said.  Hesitantly I went back to bed. I realized that while the living world was doing about its business, I had died in my sleep. And maybe seven-thirty would be too late to make any difference.   -
