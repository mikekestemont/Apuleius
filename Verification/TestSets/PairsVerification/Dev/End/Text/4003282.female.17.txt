HEART  Just things couldn't get any better !
I haven't talked to Josh. I miss him  muchas ! I wrote him on punkconnect. But he hasn't wrote back.. Maybe He'll get on later. I hope.      Things are wonderful and couldn't get any better. I've got awsome friends, my friends are all happy dappy. And I'm finally tanning! WHOO! So exctied. Works awsome. Camps awsome. I'm finally  ME  again.      I worked today. I get paid Saturday. I work Saturday all day. Wow. I'm gonna lose a bunch of weight sweating. Whoaness.      Oh god. This morning I was on my way to school and I see something in the rode. Me and Amy drive closer to it and it's a dog. I wanted to cry. Actually I did. It wasn't a small dog at all. It was like a sharpe. Someone just hit it and left it. How rude. That's just horrible. How can you do that. First off how can you hit an animal period. And then just leave it there to die. In the middle of the rode. Where another car can just sit there and drive right over it. I feel bad for the people that own the dog because it wont ever come home and they'll never know what happed to their lil one.
Look at what Josh wrote me      Oh, oh, oh. Sitting here with nothin' to do. Sitting here thinkin' only of you. But you'll never get out of there. She'll never get out of there. Texas chain saw massacre. They took my baby away from me. But she'll never get out of there. She'll never get out of there. I don't care, wohoho When I saw her on the corner. She told me told me told me told me. She wouldn't go far. Ooh, now I know I'm so much in love' .Cause she's the only girl that I'm ever thinking of.      Aww isn't he just the sweetest thing in the world. He makes me so happy whoo.
Yeah. So I'm feeling alot better.       I'm talking to Josh. So it's like whoa! I'm all excited. He said he likes me alot.  I like him too!  He makes me smile alot. He's just awsome. But lives in Alaska. Yeah, Like whoa. Oh well. Even if he lives there he can still rock my world.
So today went to school for camp. Already got a sunburn. I didn't wanna be there. Didn't wanna see ahalf of those people. Didn't wanna be up that early.       I need to call Brandon. He's giving up on Jenna. I can't let him do that. She makes him happy.      I need sleep. So badly.      I haven't talked to Josh today.  *tear*       That is all. I'm out.
Show was alright. Shit happend at the end.      I got 2 cd's and a poster. Go me. It's cause I'm hot.      Today I'm either going shopping with Amber and Brandon or I'm going to Carrolton. Don't know which yet. Brandon hasn't called and neither has Nicole.  I need new jeans and stuff.      Damage Case rocks my socks.        i this is squirt .
