About Ireland's new public smoking ban:   urlLink BBC NEWS | Europe | Irish take smoking ban in stride : "The pubs certainly look cleaner and the air is definitely better.  (Excerpt) Mind you, one national radio presenter recently complained that the air was so fresh that these days in pubs you could now smell a lot more of the customers' farts - something that the smoke had previously disguised.
