highly entertaining, gives me the giggles. kk, nighty!
Hey hey! Today has been good and is gonna get better. Had a fun/easy morning practice and it wasn't cold outside or in the water! Then went to Eagan with my mommy and they said I could come back next week and I realized that my permit expires in august instead of july!!! Later I'ma go to Spiderman 2 with matt and zachy and some other ppl, and then after that meeting up with Patrick and other ppl to go out to eat and then see FIREWORKS...altho I don't know why yet, its not the 4th...its the 2nd...but meh. Ben, you're silly. K, bye for now!  ~Moi
Oh my goodness, today was so much fun. Matthew, Iustin, and I went with our swim team to Noah's Ark, "America's Biggest Waterpark", in Wisconsin Dells. We went on rides, ate good food, beat each other up, and had a good time in general. We also watched about four movies on the rides to and from there, because it was about a 6 hour round trip. Harry Dixon managed stopping the wave pool when he made a lifeguard think he was drowning, matt smashed a pop can against his forhead FINALLY, lol, two of my lovely friends flirted the whole time (dunno who *shifty eyes*), matt also managed stepping in freshly chewed gum, and lotsa other good times occured. Tomorrow I'm most likely gonna go to Eagan and see if I can sneak in an appointment to get my license.   Dippin' Dots are the shizzit, if I was a celebrity, I would demand a constant supply of 'em.   Sorry Ben about not telling you I had a blog, I've only had it for like 4 days and I thought that whoever decided to look at my site would see my blog. Plus I haven't really talked with you lately....so don't yell at me!!! Thanks a bunch for posting a comment tho. Meant a lot.   Luv y'all tons! ~Sinziana
Wow, I haven't written in a really long time, since like, before we went to Romania. The trip was fun, really nice to see family again, and all the places we went to and things we saw were awesome. But I'm glad to be home. Nothing like air conditioning, indoor plumbing, and non-lethal water. And now that I'm back I get to be overwhelmed by everything that has to be done since I am now a senior. Like for example, the essays and college applications I have to fill out. Not looking forward to that really. And I have to study my butt off for the SAT II's so that I can get disgustingly good scores on the tests. I'm sorta excited tho, 'cept its not good that I already feel overwhelmed and school hasn't even started yet. In other news, I'm doing very well in online pool and am very happy about that. And the book "Cryptonomicon" is insanely long and very well written. That is all. Oh, and note to self: somehow get the Switchfoot and Killswitch Engage c
