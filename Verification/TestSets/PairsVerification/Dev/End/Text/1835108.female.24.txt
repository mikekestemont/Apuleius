is preggers yet?
So very tired.  Work has been nutty.  I feel like I work on a psych unit lately.  And its not only the patients...but the people I work with too.  Can everybody realize that we are working through a nursing shortage.  Just because I am the "contact" nurse for the night doesn't mean that I am responsible for the shortage.   This is an interesting month for me.  I should be registering for classes, but haven't heard from Baker about how many of my credits are transferring, we have to make three big car payments, I am in a wedding, am sort of looking for a new (or another) job, and our new bedroom furniture gets here soon.  YEAH! Exercising is going great!  Yahoo for my new treadmill. Oh yeah... my diamond earrings are ready for pick up tomorrow!  I love them and can't wait to wear them!
life seems tough lately.  love working out, after i actually get started.  but it is still tough to get my butt started. horrible loss of a patient.  glad i went to the funeral.  really really really nasty weather.  very frustrated with the house, and the water in the basement. furniture is on the way, maybe that will help with the house frustration.  we'll see.
i love my husband.  and we will be happy.  and content.  and i am committed to making that happen.
New address so that I know exactly who is reading this. getting on with my own life.  which is exactly what i was doing and just being his friend...for real.  but i can respect how that it might not be viewed as such.  bye.
its been awhile.  the computers been down, and it has been out-smarting me, at least as far as getting back on-line. i'm going to be a mom!  some days i can't believe it...it is mostly the days when i picture myself with a huge pregnant belly.  but i'm excited.  i have a friend here in yucky lansing, that is very schooled in the way of birthing.  she currently works at a birth center nearby and is going to be jason and my doula for the birth.  "doula" being our birth educator before the baby is here and the link between us and the nurses during the labor.  i think it will help to keep me calm, and hopefully help to keep me away from the drugs and focused during labor.  we'll see. work is crazy.  it is tough for me to do 3 shifts in a row every week.  i am hoping to get back on the day shift by the end of the summer.  it is just too tough for me to keep flipping back and forth between nights and days.  hopefully being on the day shift will help. the dress store in Michigan City, IN (where the bridesmaid dresses for Kimbers wedding were ordered) agreed to simply order me a bigger, and i do mean bigger, dress.  I am just hoping to have it altered to not only fit well but to be cute on me.  we'll s
