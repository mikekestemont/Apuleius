Or they decide to stagger themselves right across your path and have a discussion about which shop to go in. They stop to take photos, with the photographer standing like 2 metres away from the photographee and then getting stroppy when people walk in the way. So I'm pretty frustrated by constantly having to negotiate this slalom course of idiots and I'd imagine they all think I have tourettes with the amount of evil glares and muttered curses ;)  And then, when I've just about made it to Camden lock I have to endure the drunk punks, the leafleters, the weed salesmen and today a nice man selling what initially looked like cakes his grandma had made - how sweet I thought, having only baked some fairy cakes myself yesterday. Well, I'm sure you can guess, these cakes would have you seeing more than fairies! His selling slogan was "Hash cakes - get seriously fucked up for only a pound".  So welcome to my world, and the small part of it that can seriously piss me off within seconds. But much as I hate this part of Camden, I know one day I'll be grateful when I'm going to a fancy dress party where the theme is goth/punk/freak - I know I'll definitely be able to get an outfit ;)
So as I write this blog, daylight is rapidly disappearing, but definitely not the activity with it outside.  For this is the Swiss National Day, or as it seems for all the neighbor kids, fireworks day.  Actually, many did not wait till today. I heard many a firework exploding last night as well as throughout the day. But only now is it getting really loud.  Surprisingly, it does not seem that much different than the USA 4th, but instead of red, white, and blue, there are only the first two colors.  The Swiss channels are filled with music from the 4 different cultural areas of Switzerland.  Throughout the mountains, one can probably see many a bonfire.  I'm not Swiss of course, so for me its a manner of curiousity.  Perhaps a bit of annoyance, in that its a holiday that I don't get off as I work in Liechtenstein, and only live in Switzerland, but it doesn't really matter as it fell on a Sunday this time.  Incidently, I don't get the Liechtenstein holiday off either in 2 weeks as it will be on a Sunday as well. Oh well.  So how am I spending my Swiss Day?  Doing nothing..or close to it.  I woke up with a back ache that was most likely caused by my running down a mountain on Saturday at full speed. Thus, it was filled with me playing the odd computer game and lots of television, including 3 hours worth of East Enders on BBC Prime.  Amazing, how I managed to get myself hooked to that series.  So, a week from now I shall be at BOMO if all goes to plan.  It should be a nice change of place from the Swiss way of things :
