you want to spend eternity in hell wishing you had seen that your pride was blinding you to the Truth".  Ultimately, that is my choice (at least we agree on that, no matter how much it grieves him). Then again, I never thought I would join a Christian church and read the Bible. Look Ma, no hands! Ron, here is the hard question: What is it that gives you faith that you will rise to Heaven (bodily or just your 'soul') when the final judgment comes? (And don't say the Bible, `cause that just redirects the question) I am talking about your own personal experience. I simply refuse to make that faith leap with only fear of death pushing me. &lt;--- serious here Ron. Or the threat of eternal damnation. Or any other fear tactic. If it is simply a choice between reward and punishment, it is a no-brainer to pick the reward, but it doesn't help me with faith. Am I being clear here?
Discalmer: Ron and I both have a habit of being flippant without warning. This has got to stop. But it won't, so don't hold your breath, dear reader.
WaHOOO! Mo just got the word that she will be working for the City during the Municipal Election campaign as a researcher. Her position is officially a  Clerk II  but she tells me that she will be doing more researching and phone answering than typing. It is a full time position with every second Monday off. The position goes for 6 months. If you know Mo, you will know that she is both excited and fretting the details of becoming a full time employee. I get to to be "Mister Mom" for at least the month of June. I plan to continue to look for work, but Mo's job will take away a lot of the money pressures we have been dealing with. My EI premiums won't last forever, after all.
Thank You  urlLink Susan  for recommending The PBGs Path to " urlLink Celebrating the Underblog 2004 " list.  Do you know of (or run) a quality blog that deserves a bit of extra attention? What blog/s do you read that you wish others knew about?  Susan added a comment linking my site and added a quote from my  urlLink Introduction to the PBGs  page. On her Sister's page, she also describes what the  urlLink underblog list  is about. So far I have only had one hit from the underblog list, but since my page is way down the page (on page 8!), it is surprising that anyone even looked down that far. I guess I need to consider updating my blog more regularly if I am actually going to have visitors. Sorta like keeping a clean house. If nobody is coming, what is the point of cleaning up? But when someone   does  come, you spend the whole time of their vist bustling around cleaning dishes and moving stacks of magazines. Hmmm. My dishes are done, but the house IS a mess. Posting will have to come later, I guess &
