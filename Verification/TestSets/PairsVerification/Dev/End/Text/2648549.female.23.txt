Around December this year? And would like to take me along? :)   Nope, it's not a request. Just a hope as my other half is going to be there from October until January. And come to think of it, it's going to be our very first time being so far away from each other. Well, he is still somewhere in Asia. However, this time we won't be able to see each other’s face or hear each other's voice. **sobs** At least no during the three months since it would be a waste of time to fly to Bandung once in two weeks just as he usually did. A waste of time and a waste of money.  There you go. Gone are my days of pointlessly waiting for his surprise calls and visits.  Anyways, it's the consequence of having a long-distance relationship. I seldom think it would be hard because I barely live through it. Then again, I am thankful the plan is set after I graduated (plus hopefully-enough weeks to get a job and be preoccupied). Now that it's just two months away, let us see how we’re going to make it.   [Fervently looking for a job.]
This is cool. Unicorn has been my all-time favorite myth unit...I mean, beast (sorry, being carried away with  urlLink Age of Mythology ). Then there’s this quiz to determine which myth unit...I mean, beast, suits you most.  urlLink It’s here . Go and try it.  Did the quiz and got this on my first try.    And here's something about Unicorns...in case you're dying to know. :)  You are a Unicorn! Unicorns are pure, innocent, magestic creatures that have a spiraling white horn growing out of their forehead, and a white graceful, horses body. Unicorns represent the sign of purity, innocence, friendship, healing, rejeventation, and truth. Your horn is rare prized, but you tend to be naive, lured by a child's cry. Unicorns are reare, beautiful ans shy mythical creatures, and you are lucky to be one.   [Always know I AM lucky and am grateful for that.]
It's been a while since my last post. Got preoccupied by job-searching activities to support my life with. Anyone have a vacancy? :)  In the mean time, I think I'd just share something I wrote for my significant other. Enjoy, and comment if you wish.   THE LIGHT OF MY LIFE   (Avianti Yulianita F)   The ease when I am weary The sentry when it's all scary The warmth when I am freezing The way out when it's all confusing The sunshine on a cloudy day The rainbow chasing the rain away The twinkling nova shimmers the most leading me home when I am lost The hope when it's all gloomy That is what you are to me Without you my soul would have less worth  So thank you for being my angel on Earth   (published in  urlLink Eternal Portraits Series )
