sh*ts would be up in arms claiming "Teaching Standards are Plummeting", and "Schools Failing". It's utterly pathetic, outrageous and wrong.      There may BE a case for A-levels getting easier. Certainly teaching nowadays is more geared towards getting results and focussing purely on exam syllabus material rather than subject-wide analysis. But I think it's a little childish and cruel to trumpet this on the front pages of our newspapers for all the world to see in the most lurid way possible. As usual, our press has failed to be socially responsible in the search for sales and shock value, and has ended up being utterly reprehensible.      There we go. A bit of a brief rant, as it's late and I need to get out of here. But hope you like it and agree with it.
Hello one and all      I feel the need today to praise a group of people who work for that much-maligned institute, the NHS.       Yes, my favourite people in the world today are physiotherapists. I've had two lengthy experiences of NHS Physio over the past couple of years, and on both occasions they've been friendly, knowledgeable, helpful, and tireless.    I guess there are  some  perks of the job - if anyone's rude to you, you can make sure they get a REALLY painful work out that week - but they must see so many middling cases (of which I no doubt am one) and yet still seem to remain upbeat and positive, and give each person a thorough examination and work out.      Basically, this is a bit of a waffle really, but I just wanted to acknowledge these lovely, lovely people - I'm looking forward to my upcoming sessions...
I'm back sooner than I expected...      A few of my beloved and closest friends have decided to do the Coast-to-Coast this year (I wimped out and am doing it next year. Possibly with the same people. Mad, crazy fools).      I thought it's only fair to publish the regular updates I get throughout the course of the ordeal.      "Day 1:       Aha, top of the first peak. A small hill named Dent. It is windy. Which is fortunate as it's dried us off from this morning's soaking."      Doesn't it make you feel glad to be a lazy sod?
Bugger.      I've finally done it. I've got myself one of these blog thingies.      I've been meaning to for ages, even though a) I've got nothing interesting to say (unlike Tom Reynolds, author of the blog "  urlLink  Random Acts of Reality   ", which is required reading every day) and b) I'm not (officially) insane (unlike "Scaryduck". The name says it all). But this is response really to my beloved friend Jon's comment that "You have to be a bit odd and narcissistic to do one of these". It's pretty much true, especially at the moment when you think that no-one except me is going to read this, but hey!      Anyway, I'm going to go, after this pointless introduction. I have decided that tomorrow will be the start of my blogging life...procrastination is the finest of a
