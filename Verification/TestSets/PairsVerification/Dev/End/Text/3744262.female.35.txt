she has raised four kids of her own. I don't know what I would be like if I didn't have Tom's family around me, now. I am grateful at least for this: it happened here, with people around, instead of when I was alone at home.  I finally called my own mom and told her, but not my dad yet (apparently my uncle called him for me, which is kind of embarassing). I just didn't want to drop a bomb on her when I was in a less than calm state.  I am on my way back to the hospital now. More later.
For the third and fourth time in my life today (well, yesterday and today), I rode in an ambulance. Up front, last time. It is very surreal to see familiar landscape lighted by strobe lights.  Adia had two seizures. As of this moment, no one knows why. We have been moved from ER to a PICU at HOPE. That probably means nothing to most of the people who read this, if any). ER attempted a spinal tap, but Adia was a bit too against it for them to get it done right. So it has to be done again.   Needless to say, I'm unhappy. Also, pissed, bewildered and more scared than I ever imagined I could feel. But oddly disconnected, too. It is inconceivable that there is anything really wrong. Unfathomable.  I am sitting in the lobby of the PICU. We are not allowed to be in the room while the spinal tap is done, to reduce the risk of infection. Also, to prevent us from seeing a team of medical staff hold my screaming child down and poke her with what is probably a long and scary needle. Lobby of PICU just happens to have a computer with internet access that runs IE (and pretty much nothing else as far as I can tell).  I keep thinking it might be good if I could doze off. Whenever I close my eyes, I see Adia dancing naked in front of the TV.   She is dreaming now. I can see her eyes move. She is pretty heavily drugged... sedated to prevent any more seizures and to allow Them to do their tests. When Adia sleeps, her eyelids never close completely, so you can see her blue eyes glinting. Sometimes she almost looks like she is waking up, and I think maybe she can see me, but I know that she's really looking inward. Her fingers twitch, and sometimes she talks... but not now. Just the occasional bubble of sound.  I haven't called my mom or dad yet. For one thing, it's 2:45ish in the morning. For another, it would be rotten for them to be stewing in isolation. It's bad enough that we don't know what's going on, but we are at least here and with each other (and Tom's parents and siblings as well). I figure I can probly call my dad around 4-5a, and my mom around 6:30-7a, if They've Found Something, and Adia does not need m
