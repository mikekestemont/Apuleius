a nice Op-Ed piece in this morning's New York Times .  He makes some excellent points and nicely articulates why this country needs a drastic change in leadership, while managing to refrain from finger-pointing or name-calling.  Well put, Boss.

This is kind of random, but things have been slow around here as of late, so I thought I'd share anyway.   If any of you are stand-up comedy fans or just fans of things that are truly hilarious, I encourage you to  urlLink check out the work of my hero, Bill Hicks .  Hicks died of cancer at the tragically early age of 32, but in his short life he left and indelible mark on both stand-up comedy and the world itself.  As a comic, there is no one--even Master Pryor--whose work I find to be more hilarious, brilliant and inspiring.  Hicks is the comic whose material I most wish I could rip off.  He's so good.  The thing that truly differentiated Hicks from other comics was the philosophical depth he infused his material with.  Equally hilarious and trancendant, his jokes made you laugh, made you angry, made you see the truth about the world and all its absurdity.   Check out his stuff, pretty much any of it--I promise, you'll thank me for it...

Sad that this is what we've been reduced to...   urlLink More here  from the WaPo.
( urlLink Kerry has a nice turnout .)     But 15,000 people braved what local officials described as the hottest day of the year while they waited for a fleet of Kerry/Edwards tour buses to arrive. Nearly 100 people had to be treated for heat exhaustion or dehydration, according to Scranton Fire Chief Tom Davis.      The size of the crowd surprised both city and campaign officials, who claimed the turnout was a reflection of the vitality of both.      It's significant that Kerry picked Scranton — a socially conservative swing city with a reputation for supporting labor in a battleground state — to hold his first rally after accepting the Democratic Party's nomination for president during this week's convention in Boston.   (snip)   And when Kerry tried to introduce to the crowd his younger daughter, third-year medical student Vanessa, she had gone to administer first aid to a man who had passed out.      Meanwhile, at some bar in Texas, the Bush Twins just passed out ...
I can't believe this moron gets as many hits as he does.   urlLink Read this funny story  about his stealing an image, then doing a clumsy Photoshop job to try and cover it up.  What a c
