today was so grey, so cold, so sterile. It left me feeling alone, but not in a bad sense. It was solitude, not loneliness. A pure feeling where I just felt like flopping on the floor and not  being  anything, just another piece of dust on my way to nowhere. It was peaceful, and the whole mood of the day ...it felt like it was waiting for something. The Cyrs came over for supper. Charlotte is sweet, and Christy manages to be fun but dignified. Michelle is so  real , so earthy, so tangible. And sooo funny. We walked to Ashlee's after, and she had us in stitches. Tomorrow I kind of hope the weather keeps up, and then Ashlee (with her artist's eye for detail) and I can go out, and I can take pictures. I have this urge to walk downtown and observe - right now picture taking feels like this rite I  must  accomplish. I feel removed from everything, like the world is behind a window and I'm outside looking in. I know it has to do with my wanting to take pictures, but I haven't quite figured out how.
No, not the band... What are kindred spirits? Souls that brush up against each other, that can be familiar with one another without having to meet, or without having to spend a whole hour together. Entities because it can happen between a sick old woman and a business man, or a child and a dog, or a person walking and a lonely teen staring out from the doorway. People can know each other from a gesture, a glance, without having to go for coffee and make superficial conversation. What gift is this? It isn't a bond between the two - more of a silver thread they both know is there, they both might not mention, but that replenishes both, quenches their thirst. It heals wounds, gladdens hearts, brings tears to eyes, draws people together and leaves them wondering if the other felt the same thing. It somehow brings slight pangs of what can only be described as compassion or nostalgia, the wish to know the whole of someone, not just what the hazy window of the retinas shows. It turns two into one for an instant, and in that instant they are each other's grandparents, each other's children, friends,  soulmates , vulnerable but strengthened through each other. Some friends can achieve it over time, some friends have it from the very beginning. But everyone feels it once in their lifetime, that this person understands them, could embrace them, could cry on their shoulder and have the other cry with them.  ...or maybe that's just me.
I was able to rewrite it (see below) last night. It's not as long, or as good, in my opinion, but at least it exists. This time around I wasn't able to capture the moods of different things like I had before, but I guess this is good enough. Will have a link to it under 'stories' in 2 secs - it's called  Dreams .
