2nd year of the MBA course is not discussed in much detail, since there is nothing new for the students, and each of them becomes engrossed in their own specialized subjects. At the end of the 2nd year there are 3 categories of students – those who land up the jobs of their dreams, those who do not manage to do it, but still end up with decent jobs, and those who have to rough it out on their own. As you guessed, Peter belongs to the 3rd category. His search leads him to meet eminent people of the business and technology world, like Rupert Murdoch and Steven Jobs. He opts for a career in Television Journalism, and joins Murdoch’s firm. Then comes the depression of the early 90s. With job-cuts being the order of the day, MBAs start getting laid-off and the Stanford students, Peter included, are no exception.  Peter’s conclusion is that though a Stanford MBA does little to mould a person into a good, or indeed, successful manager, it does have its merits. The respect it commands in the industry is enormous. In Peter’s own words, the likes of Murdoch and Jobs would not cast a second glance at his Resume, had he not been a Stanford alumni. Stanford also gives students the confidence to face life’s situations with dignity and confidence (If I could get through Stanford MBA School, I can get through this situation!).  A very readable book, and recommended for those who want to know what they’re getting into, by enrolling for the MBA at reputed business schools.

The author's dog Montmorency, always willing to be a part of the excitement also joins in.  The book is a chronicle of their travels upriver interspersed with the author's musings on various topics ranging from the silly, like how entertaining and exasperating it is to observe women towing boats, to events with historical significance like signing of the Magna Charta.  The humour is decidedly very British; the kind that one comes across in books by Wodehouse. Both Jerome and Wodehouse have perfected the art of describing incidents with dry wit, sticking to the British tradition of maintaining the 'Stiff Upper Lip' in doing so.  To be read by one and all! It takes you out of this world into one that is filled with fun and laughter! In Jerome's own words - the world persists in recognising him as the author of "Three Men in a Boat", though he has written other books that have far more to offer in terms of literary significance and humour in his o
