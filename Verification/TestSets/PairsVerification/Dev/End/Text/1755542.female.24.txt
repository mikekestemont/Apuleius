really didn't seem severe or consistent with any disease process.  He was Hmong, a hill tribe in Southeast Asia that has a rather unusual worldview that colors everything they percieve about the world including their disease symptoms.  Hmong patients will often present with seemingly random symptoms that they feel are all related to one another and obtaining a history from them can be very frustrating.  I wasn't getting anywhere so I asked him what he thought might be going on.  He then admitted that a few years ago he committed adultery with a woman in another province and he was worried about HIV or other STDs.  He had gotten himself checked at the hospital and was found to be negative for the virus but he was still very worried.  It seemed that he was actually struggling with feelings of guilt from his unfaithfulness to his wife.  Through one of the Hmong nurse-aides I told him that not only can our bodies become diseased but our spirits as well.  We told him that medicines can do nothing for sicknesses of the spirit, only Jesus can heal them.  He becames very interested when we shared the gospel with him and afterward he went to go talk to a Hmong missionary who works at the clinic.  I pray that the gospel of Jesus finds fertile soil in his heart.
Well, our Blogging has slown down considerably but it doesn't seem that our life has.  The college girls that were here for the summer have gone back to the States and are probably sleeping off jet lag as I type this.  I miss them and Aiden misses them too.  Not that we will be here much longer.  I was reminding Josh yesterday that next week is the last full week that he has here at the clinic.... amazing.  Despite all the changes and some difficulties, it has really begun to feel like HOME here.  I do hope that God brings us back.  Josh and I will be dissappearing  for a few nights while we celebrate our 3 year anniversary (July 28).  Wow, 3 years married to an amazing man.  God has richly blessed me indeed.  This weekend Josh and Ryan are going with Dr. Tom to a very small village (14 families or so) for a mobile clinic.  Your prayers for their travel and ministry would be very appreciated.  After that we have our aforementioned "last full week," then we have part of a week, a flight to Hong Kong, a bit of time there taking advantage to see a place we have never seen, and then our flight back to Dallas.   Latest news in Aiden's world is that he is a monkey!  He has climed up on top of his walker, climed off a tall bed, tried to climb stacked chairs, and I am sure his climbing adventures have only begun.   Well, I am off for now.  It may be a while before you see another post on this blog.  Then again, miracles do happen and Ryan may actually blog while we are gone.  *
