 And now I just feel like I can't sing it. *sighs*  I wanna though. This song, I feel like I can sing it REALLY well. And I wanna know if my talent sucks right now or not T_T I've lost a lot of faith as a singer and I wanna see if I really do suck right now as bad as I think.  Nya. Yeah. What I'm tryin' to record is this song, I'm Still Here by The Goo Goo Dolls. It's an awesome song. Really, it is:  I am a question to the world Not an answer to be heard Or a moment That's held in your arms  And what do you think you'd ever say? I won't listen anyway You don't know me And I'll never be what you want me to be  And what Do you think you'd understand? I'm a boy, no, I'm a man You can't take me And throw me away  And how can you learn what's never shown? Yeah, you stand here on your own They don't know me 'Cause I'm not here  And I want a moment to be real Want to touch things I don't feel Want to hold on and feel I belong And how can the world want me to change? They're the ones they stay the same They don't know me 'Cause I'm not here  And you see the things they never see All you wanted-I could be Now you know me And I'm not afraid  And I want to tell you who I am Can you help me be a man? They can't break me As long as I know who I am  And I want a moment to be real Want to touch things I don't feel Want to hold on and feel I belong And how can the world want me to change They're the ones they stay the same They can't see me But I'm still here  They can't tell me who to be 'Cause I'm not what they see Yeah, the world is still sleepin' while I keep on dreaming for me And their words are just whispers and lies that I'll never believe  And I want a moment to be real Want to touch things I don't feel Want to hold on and feel I belong And how can they say I'll never change? They're the ones they stay the same I'm the one now 'Cause I'm still here I'm the one 'Cause I'm still here I'm still here I'm still here I'm still here ~I'm Still Here by The Goo Goo Dolls  Hopefully, I can go home and maybe have this done. If not... I just won't record myself for a few years, 'cause this is like, my last chance to boost my self esteem about my vocals.  Yeah. Yar. Whatever.  ~Crystal
Nya. This morning, all I'm doing is moaning.      So... good moaning.      *sigh* I'm only on to check mah e-mail for Alex's reply and to check my sister's blog. Which I haven't done yet.      I'll update later tonight... if I remember...      ~
