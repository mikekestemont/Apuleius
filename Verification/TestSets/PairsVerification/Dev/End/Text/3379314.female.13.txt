tons of scarfts and did this super model pose. oh yeah. And then Zoe put on a 'Mrs. Kutcher' hat and i snaped a shot.    Then we went on the carosel. We took pictures of that too. We were having so much fun! acting like we were really on horses. lol.   I was planning on having zoe sleeping over but when she got here i started getting into fights with my mom and spencer and konrad and she had to go home. God i hate that. Spencer started the whole thing he is such a loser!   Well thats all for now. ill write l8r...  Samie
Just got back from killing this huge spider that had fangs and totally freaked me out. i got so scared wen i saw it in my sink. i sprayed it with the fouset hose thing and bernt it too! i was totally freakin!     Tomarow i might go to the mall with zoe. I have to get a top for the usher concerT! i cant find one any wheres!    Also the day b4 school starts zoe might sleep over! yeah fun! we will get ready for the first day of the last year of middle school together and just hang out. it would also be totally awesome if she was in my cluster and in my homeroom! Wayyyy coools.     Man it would really suck if i got Autumn in my cluster. I mean shes nice but i can onlii take so much of he and she has SAA (smelly, afro armpits) ew.... smelly. Also i found out ian is staying back so i hope hes not in my cluster to... along with edgardo... i defently hope hes not in my cluster again.. icks. Eww it would really suck if Emily Crewson was in my cluster! she is such a snob and she thinks she is just so hott. i dont know why everybody pretends to like her. nobody does but everybody acts like they r best friends with her. its so stupid. in fact i have never met one person who has said anything nice about that freak.   I hope there are all my friends in my cluster like zoe as i already said and courtney and rachel T and C, and Kluga and Krystal! And courtney and Becky and michele... and lauren. and so many more!   Well i guess thats it for now    Samie
