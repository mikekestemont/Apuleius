think it would be fun to live in the big city and have a writing career where you didn’t have to work Monday through Friday and went shopping at Prada and other expensive stores without worry. Guess I just need to win the Lotto!
Thursday, July 1, 2004   I worked from 8am – 8:30pm today. But I don’t mind because I got caught up on most of my claims. From 6-8:30, Michelle and I decorated the office for the 4th of July party tomorrow…since no one else volunteered to help. But I don’t mind, we had a good time getting things ready.  Things have been rough between Kevin and I. We’ve just been fighting a lot…or not talking at all. I wish we could figure out the problem. But he doesn’t seem like he wants to talk about things. I’ve been having health problems too and it’s been stressing me out. The doctors can’t seem to find what is wrong! But enough of that. I get to spend tomorrow night at Cindy’s house. Her and Chris are spending the night at a nice hotel for their anniversary and so I agreed to house sit and stay with Jenni. (They don’t want her to be home alone because she’s a girl.) That’s about it for now.
My day started out great..until my friend, Michelle, gave me an attitude at work...I know I shouldn't have let it happen, but she caused the rest of my day to be a downer because of it. The afternoon was good, though... I met Cindy for Happy Hour and then went to Central Market with her and her family to meet her brother's ex-wife Christina, her boyfriend, and their kids, for dinner. Christina's boyfriend is in the military and moving to New York in 10 days. We'll miss him...he's a really great guy. Central Market is kind of a "rich person's" grocery store. A lot of Mercedes and Lexus, etc in the parking lot. It might be expensive, but I love it! They have the best food there...and stuff you couldn't find at your local store. We sat outside on the patio and ate while the kids played on the playground. We also had a few drinks. Christina's boyfriend introduced me to a new beer called Blue Moon that you drink with an orange in it (instead of a lime). I had a good time. I got some papers to fill out before I go to the surgeon which made me start thinking about the whole situation and now I am nervous again...though I'm sure I'm fine. I just don't think it could possibly be cancer. I don't feel it in me...if that makes sense. Not much else going on. I'm going to Florida this weekend. I get there Friday, go out with my friend, Kristen, for her birthday. Then I spend all day Saturday with my family and come home. I'm really looking forward to it.  Until next time...  Work like you don't need the money, Love like you've never been hurt, and dance like no one's w
