Cover letters should be short, strong, and interesting so the reader moves on and reads your resume.  Cover letters should not be a recap of your resume.  Keep the cover letter to 3 or 4 short paragraphs.    Paragraph I.  Let the reader know what you are applying for and how you heard about it.  Paragraph II. Use 3 or 4 bullet points with strong action verbs demonstrating how what you've done elsewhere could be done at the job you are applying for.  Talk about how much above goal you are if you are in sales or how far below budget you came in at if you are a project manager or how quickly you accomplished XYZ etc.  Paragraph III.  Invite the reader to contact you for more information about how you can help them.  Paragraph IV is optional...if you need more room.  Folks reading resumes get a LOT of them.  Readers will really appreciate your ability to get to the point quickly and highlighting what they need to know.  And be sure to SPELLCHECK your document!   Good luck!

Afternoon!  Today I read a stat which was very interesting.  According to the Cornell University Career Services Department research show that up to  80 percent  of all job openings are  unadvertised .  As a recruiter I know that many jobs are never advertised for many reasons.  But I'll be honest, I did not think the number was that high...50% or more maybe..but 80%.  Wow!  My advice:  Find a recruiter you  like, know and trust  and they'll help you find the best job for YOU.  Make it a great d
