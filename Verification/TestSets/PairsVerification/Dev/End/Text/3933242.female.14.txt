Hi.. This is my first time coming here. I personally think that this is a very good webby. I was so tired out today that hope I juz can shut my eyes and let me float in the outspace in my mind.  Things are getting so stress up recently  .My class performed in Talent quest which I think that they done their best. THe dance was beautiful.I was so proud of my class.. hehex..i am not really implying that i am boasting&nbsp;.. i juz want&nbsp;my classmate who perform to know that i apreciate their affort...&nbsp;a little lame through... Haiz.. but i was so shattered apart on our class's internal- conflict-- it was definely scary and not worth talking about.GEez.. caNt say much.On monday is our 2.4 , and also our NAPFA test which means physical fitness test.. i hope tht i can pass and improve.Futhermore, tml is my chinese focus test, i haven study YET and after .. it would be a inter-cca-captain ball... i Hope band win.. BAND must win.. we wil not let others despise band tht we cant make it.. we have to show others about wat we are capable of.. even though we are not strong in fitness, but i believe as long as we are  strong in unity ... we are to be sure to beat the rest!
I think it   really matters   for us to look on the bright side of life whenever we are feeling down or  lost or sad or whatever negative feelings inside you... this is very important for me as i go through this yet-to-come difficult ordeal of my entire life time.. I had noticed that i have a wonderfully inspirating ,brave parents who stood with the family alll this while.. i had notices this when this major problem (so sorry.. confidentual)  pop up of my life... i never had expect this problem to arise... hope this wil get betta each day... i hope very much... but, however, through this , i learnt to learn many kinda things i have yet to discover when i am still in my happy days of life... maybe this is a blessing in disguise... i   must not give up   no matter what... i must achieve something to make my parents happy.. and i will.... i hope... i mean i must....(can'T be discouraged at this point of t
