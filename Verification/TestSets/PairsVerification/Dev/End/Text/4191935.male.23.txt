remote connection to the state where he is running. Keyes howled, rightly so, when Hillary carpet-bagged her way into New York and when he was running for Senate in Maryland one can presume he would have made an issue of it if his opponent were from, say, Ohio.  Anyways, Goldberg makes a lot of excellent points about the state of democracy today, views I have long held myself. He correctly points out that campaign finance laws that were designed to prevent wealthy people from having too great an influence in elections has achieved just the opposite effect as it now encourages wealthy people to essentially buy themselves seats (see Jon Corzine, Michale Hufington, and now the heir to the Coors brewery fortune in Colorado). He is also right about celebrity-worship corrupting the process as morons like Arnold Schwarzenneger and Sono Bono can actually be elected to high office.
One of my heroes, Alan Keyes has taken up the challenge of being the GOP standard-bearer in the Illinois senate race against supposed Democratic wunderkind Barack Obama. I personally think Obama is quite over-rated. Sure, his speech was pretty good, but hardly anything amazing. The fact that it was so widely praised, I believe, is an illustration of the overall lacklustre roster of Democratic speakers as well as an example of their constant patronizing of racial minorities, whereby the standard is set so low that any reasonable surpassing of it is equated with greatness. Jesse Jackson Redux, perhaps? Keyes, on the other hand, is  by far the finest orator in all of American politics. You can download his speeches at  urlLink http://www.renewamerica.us/archives/speeches.htm  and see for yourself. Anyways, there's an article in today's Chicago Sun-Times (see link above) where Keyes really takes Obama to task over his support of abortion, accusing him of taking "the slave-owner's position" on this question of civil rights and suggesting that the kind of thinking that supports legalized infanticide is the same kind of thinking that would have the two of them (they're both black) "still picking cotton." This is shaping up to be one hell of a race and it's getting nasty very early on. Unfortunately, Keyes is poised to get his ass kicked, as has been his tendency whenever he's undertaken one of his quixotic runs at high office, but hopefully, this race will get a lot of attention and Keyes can win a few converts for the good side with his brilliant and passionate message of moral renewal.
Welcome everyone to my new blog, Athwart History (if you don't get the title, go read William F. Buckley's statement on the founding of National Review). It seems everyone I know has a blog these days and I read many of them rather religiously, so it seems only appropriate that I start one of my own. This blog will be updated pretty regularly and will be my way of sharing my thoughts on conservative politics, baseball, books, music, and anything else that interests me. I hope that you wil check back often and share your comments and ideas with m
