this relationship of mine has been thru lotsa ups and downs.. am not sure whether am in it anymore! well, only God knows how crushed and hurt am right now..  anyway, the past few weeks were a bit dull.. didnt do nothing much.. been in and out the hospital like almost everyday now.. i even been warded for few days last week.. but my condition is still the same.. no progress! i guess, this time around, my time will eventually come.. but am not going to give up.. coz i've promise someone tht i love so dearly something.. by hook or by crook, am gonna have to go thru this alone.. am not forcing anyone to be there with me.. coz it is a very bumpy ride.. currently my life is so empty.. am heartless.. someone is holding back my heart.. and i would like it to remain tht way.. eventho i didnt get anything in return.. i dont mind.. i strongly believe that my purpose here in this dying world of ours, is to please and make everyone else happy.. and i kinda like it coz it gives me a great satisfaction if i manage to do so.. but now   am not a satisfied   bunny    !   coz i think someone is very mad at me.. and honestly, i have no idea what i've done to him.. he did something kinda hurtful to me last friday.. and i was deeply hurt but i guess tht doesnt matter right.. coz am no one and no one cares abt this silly girl's feeling.. life is juz wonderful aite? i might not be able to blog as often as i did before.. i'll be going somewhere quite far soon.. till then take care dear b
