At g4ttv there are these asshats who think that if you join at a certain time i.e.; 2002, it makes you cool some how. What the fuck is up with that? Just because you joined seven months before a person it some how makes you more superior than them? You know what fuck them and fuck people who think like them.   I remeber at techtv no n00b got made fun ragged on unless they totally deserved it. That's why I liked techtv everyone practially knew everyone and really respected eachother post count or no post count.   I admit I do that myself sometimes but most of the time I'm joking. So the next time you rag on someone because they joined later than you do us all a favor and kill yourself.....yes I meant that literally.
Ladies and gentleman of the blogging community, popular music is in dire need of you help. Even as record sales continue to rise, artistic expression and even involvement decrease with every Britney and N Sync clone forced into collective CD collection. Of course, music is about fun, and everyone has a right to listen to whatever they desire, but as these cookie cutter starlets achieve the bulk of our interest and music dollar an ever growing number of musicians making music from the heart are stymied and left in the shadows. Children force fed MTV's definition of music will never know the joy of listening to a real masterpiece that transcends mere trend to become a anthem for any generation. I plead with you, take an interest in music and pursue it. Listen to Jazz, Blues, Classical, and anything you like, but make sure you decide what YOU listen to. Don't let the record companies looking to make maximum profit from minimal effort decide for you.
I just bought tickets to what I'm sure will be a very crowded viewing of "Spiderman 2" tonight. I'm sure some hick will think he's the only person in the building and offer his brilliant commentary on every painstaking moment of the film. In hopes that perhaps, that very redneck somehow has access to the internet and is viewing this blog right now, I would just like to remind everyone that talking, taking phone calls, and otherwise annoying your fellow movie enthusiasts is considered a faux pau.  The last time I was at the show, a family of three with no shoes walked in half way through. They sent their child of four years old to ask for candy from others, and then proceeded to call friends to brag about skipping out on the movie they payed to see and watching this one for free. This thing isn't common in my area, and I was rather surprised. If you have ever done this, please, refrain from entering public in the future for any reason and form an equestrian society in the woods behind you h
