Since my fun filled summer was a bit ruined *cough* no special reason *cough* lol *winks* oh yeah so I'm just here in my room wondering about things....like what I will be like in a week (maybe not as bored lol) but anyway 19 days for Steubi!!!!!!!! YAY!
Today......I did ....NOTHING at all! WOW it's amazing how I can just do nothing the whole day LOL. I was supposed to go to the movies but it rained so...Yeah. 19 more days left for Steubi ahhhh I can't wait! Well that's all for today nothing special happen.....Except that I'm alive that's really special!!!!!
Summer has officially started for me! Next week I'll have to start doing my service hours and band camp and everything it will be so much fun, I can barely wait! Also I cannot wait for Steubi it will be so much fun!!!!!! Today I went to Six Flags with a friend it was very fun. I've realize that a lot of people don't smile...it's a bit sad, so I decided to smile at every person that would look at me. And, what do you know? A girl even told me "Your skirt is so cute" and she kept smiling and seem happy afterwards. I guess a smile does mean a lot! God B
