hehe. Then I went out to eat and chilled with fam..always fun.    Thursday:  Well judging by the weather outside it doesnt seem to be an action filled day..but so far its been cool...just chillin and anticipating the great things that lay ahead for me. I am real excited for one particular thing..but that everyone will just have to wait and see. Next I am excited to start school and finally have the year I want.. with my extra determination and support group guiding me.                                         I sense good things...cant wait for the ride           Favorite band/song now:     "I dare you to move"   by:   switchfoot          Everyone's here     Everyone's here     Everybody's watching you now     Everybody waits for you now     What happens next?     I dare you to move     I dare you to lift yourself up off the floor     I dare you to move--                                                                                                               ::star::
Wow what a day was  Monday.. lets just say I had nothing to write about it because it was too much of a whirlwind.  Tuesday:  Like I said change isnt easy but this change is getting more and more better to adjust to. Its always good to let go of the negative energy from your life and stick only to the more positive. I have learned that you come in contact with people and once you learn that they wont do anything but bring out the worst in you, not be anything positive in your life and only cause drama..what good are they? Its better to let go of them before it gets worse. Throughout these two days, as fast as it seems, I have uncovered the worse and best in people..and have discovered who truly are my friends. Well all I can say is that I have listened to my heart and trusted my instincts in order to separate the problem causers to the friends  (I know I have made the right choice).      Words to think about:      Friend:   somebody who has a close personal relationship of mutual affection and trust with another.    Hate:   dislike somebody or something intensely: to dislike somebody or something intensely, often in a way that evokes feelings of anger, hostility, or animosity.   - Strong words that should only be used towards those who deserve them. -
Today:  its been a really good day spiritually wise. I havent been stressed or upset and I find this sheer happiness to be so great. The turn-around? I guess you can say a bit of separation. Sometimes a disconnection goes a long way. Now I wonder if I will add the cause of this back into the routine. I guess you can say it used to be for the better but now I find it unhealthy... but then again it may be hard to detach. Change isnt always easy.
