Happy 2b Hardcore chapter 7 mix for those of you taking notes...anyway the chorus is 'Don't cry for me, when your nights are cold and lonely'. My little bro misinterpreted and has been singing for the past few days and blamed me that my techno was getting him weird looks at school- not surprising seeing he was singing wait for it:                            " Don't cry for me, when your  nuts  are cold and lonely"                     Till next Time peeps,                                                        Shaunsy
Have you ever suffered from silence?? sat still enough till the sheer emptiness of the space around you and the lack of sound begins to gnaw against your skull?? The ordeal many just like me face now is too suffer such agony. To exist for 3 hours almost everyday in a world where the incessant scratching of pen against paper becomes your only melody.               Why do we endure this?? Because we have no choice... because we are so driven or competetive that all that is essential to our meagre existence is to see the results of our time in that drearisome world escalate? Are we so petty that these numbers will shape and define us? If so what after? What will there be for us but emptiness to have given so much of ourselves to something so fleeting as a number?              All I know is this, come what may all of us at one time must endure this silence. Its what this silence does to us that will define this all i remeber every time i free myself from that world is the vouce in my head whispering  I won't back down  when the silence becomes most unbearable let that be your melody .. never surrendur to failure but strive to do your best and come out of that world prepared to live...                                            Good Luck to all who must endure...                                                                                                   Shaunsy
