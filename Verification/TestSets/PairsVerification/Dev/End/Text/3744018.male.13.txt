month."  Ron couldn't reply as he had to race to the seventh year boy's bathroom to throw up again.  "Ron...I'm sorry," said Harry apologetically, after Ron finished heaving up everything in his stomach.  "You can keep your apology â€“Blaugh!- and you can take your knife out of my back. -Blaugh!- Mates don't do this to one another. -Blagh!-  So you can find a new one!" yelled Ron, with his head in the toilet.  "Ron you don't mean it. She said you wouldn't be emotionally mature enough to handle it," Harry explained logically, trying to calm Ron down from breaking their trusted friendship.  "Mature?!... Emotionally mature to handle my best mate lying to me and my love... Hermione... Her betrayal to me for Malfoy?!" Ron bellowed, while sticking his red and green face out of the toilet. "She's right again, because I can't handle it. Because, I don't want to handle it!"  Ron stood up and stuck his head under the shower to wash his face and hair.  "Ron, why don't you just tell her how you feel and I'm sure she will dump the ferret," Harry pleaded with Ron, along the running shower.  "Little late for that, wouldn't you say Harry?

Yeah, that's what I should've done instead. All that evil crap, so I could win her heart. I mean Hermione can't help it; chicks dig evil, twisted monsters." Ron said bitterly.  "Ron will you slow down," Harry yelled, reaching the bottom of the Boys' dormitory spiral staircase, as Ron briskly made for the Portrait hole.  "I should've been a Slytherin bad-boy and then I could have dated whoever I wanted." Ron cracked madly, while slamming the portrait on Harry's face.  Harry said nothing as he came to a complete stop and simply looked at the back of the Portrait entrance.  "What's wrong with him," asked Ginny, coming up behind Harry.  "He knows."  "Oh...I better go talk to him before he does something rash," said Ginny, brushing up against Harry to get out.  "No Ginny, He just needs some time on his own. He's in a lot of pain," said Harry, grabbing Ginny by the arm to stop h
