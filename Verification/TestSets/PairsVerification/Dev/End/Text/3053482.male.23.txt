Fred.  urlLink     Brad found some people he knew and I observed their conversation photographically.  urlLink     We were surrounded by buildings.  urlLink     Tim was surrounded by women.  urlLink     Tim scored some digits.  urlLink     We then began a journey to the Pearl Street Bar & Grill.  On our journey, I observed this interesting bumper sticker.  urlLink     At Pearl Street we drank some beers, ordered chicken fingers, listened to Strictly Hip (a Tragically Hip cover band), and played air hockey.  urlLink      urlLink     Tim was still surrounded by women.  urlLink     While we were still playing air hockey.  urlLink      urlLink      urlLink      Fun was had by all.

Last night I went to the Schrock compound for some band practice.  After band practice, I began taking several pictures that I was taking for no other reason then to put them on my blog.  First I took a panoramic shot of Tim's room that we practice in.  urlLink     Then I took a shot of the drumset.  urlLink     Then I took a shot of some pictures on Tim's ceiling.  The one on the left is a shot of the Schrock children in 1996.  The portrait above it is of the famous Mike Slagor of Akron, New York, and next to him is a portrait of Eddie Van Halen.  Finally, the picture on the far right is the Schrock family portrait from 1996.  urlLink     Here is an Albert Einstein poster.  urlLink     Here is Tim's window sill.  urlLink     Here is a shot of Fred blowing his nose.  urlLink     The next few shots demostrate my ability to have fun without the participation of others.  These pictures all incorporated the use of the ten second timer feature on my camera.  urlLink      urlLink      urlLink      urlLink     This last picture is of Tim laughing extremely hard at the fact that I just spit out a whole lot of water out of my mouth.  I tried to get a photo of me chugging a bottle of water as fast as I could but what happened was that I put too much water in my mouth and started to gag on it and spit it out.  So instead of getting a shot of me chugging water, I got a shot of me choking on it.  urlLink     This is the post water embarrassment in all its glory.  urlLink      urlLink      urlLink      That's it.  Fun with photography.  ADIOS.
