However, I have a growing suspicion that people are percieving me as distant or antisocial because I do not reciprocate with another "How are you."      info.link:  urlLink http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ctfonts/WordRecognition.aspx   [Listening to: Tequila -  urlLink The Champs  (02:13)]

I'm important. You, the unwashed masses, are not privileged enough to gaze upon my grand design. I mean, just look at how fucking artsy and creative I am to have an image like that letting you know that you're not smart and popular enough to be a friend of mine. I also have other pictures. Like of fairies and angels or whatever. I mean, they have abso-fucking-lutely nothing to do with This Journal Being Friends Only, but who are YOU to question my artistic vision? Just observe how effortlessly the template and style of my journal flows with the content. This bastion of perfection is obviously lost on your narrow and short-sighted view of the world. You can comment in a futile attempt to be added, but I will taunt you mercilessly until you leave me and my select group of Chosen alone, as we transcend beyond our physical forms and experience a higher plane of existence.      info.link:  urlLink http://www.subservientpresident.net/   [Listening to: California Sun -  urlLink The Rivieras  (02:26)]

Yes, Uday! How is the rascal?  EDWARDS:  He's telling me... He wants to know, "Where the fuck are my virgins?"
I want to start a science fiction serial novel here. It will be difficult to achieve a balance, as most of the genre either takes itself much too seriously and comes across silly, or is just silly to begin with.      info.link:  urlLink http://www.newsmeat.com/fec/hof.php   [Listening to: Ain't No Mountian High Enough -  urlLink Marvin Gaye  (05:00)]
Wednesday, November 12, 2008   BREAKING NEWS (JNN - Washington, D.C.) Moments ago, Kenyan-American Presidential candidate Barack Obama humbly admitted defeat in the 2008 Presidential election.
