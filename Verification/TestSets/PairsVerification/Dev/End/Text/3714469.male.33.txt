decided to release the record this Friday. --------------------- This man's bones have been picked clean. Enough already. Now if they were to make a musical about his life, that would be different.
There is an extremely advanced version of "All Tomorrow's Parties" on Lou Reed's  urlLink website . Just click on the "jukebox" function and listen to track two. Track one is suprisingly overt version of "Venus in Furs."
Some advanced Lou Reed lyrics, courtesy of Britt at the Advancement Foundation:  Women  I love women, I think they're great they're a solace to the world in a terrible state They're a blessing to the eyes, a balm to soul what a nightmare to have no women in the world  I love women I love women I love women we all love women  I used to look at women in the magazines I know that it was sexist, but I was in my teens I was very bitter, all my sex was on the sly I couldn't keep my hands off women, and I won't till I die  I love women ah, I love women we love women we all love women  A woman's love can lift you up, and women can inspire I feel like buying flowers and hiring a celestial choir A choir of castratis to serenade my love they'd sing a little Bach for us and then we'd make love  I love women I love women We all love women we love women ------------------- This is truly advanced. What I like is that it is such an obvious thing to say--"I love women"--yet it's deceptively profound. It's  sort of like "I Can't Get No (Satisfaction)" in that way. Now, the castratis are a bit unnerving, but all in all, a spectacular advanced effort.
According to  urlLink this , Richie Stotts (formerly of the Plasmatics) has written four songs with Canadian adult-contemporary singer-songwriter Carla Lother. Apparently Stotts no longer has his old mohawk, which is the most overt hairstyle of them all (unless worn by an advanced artist). The Plasmatics were known for blowing up TVs and driving buses off cliffs, whereas Lother has done "numerous jingles for the likes of Maxwell House and MasterCard." He said when he first saw her play that "it was a great show, but her music was...Celtic-influenced." Since leaving the Plasmatics, he went back to school and got a degree in geology and now works at "the computer department of a Wall Street financial firm."  Let's see: he went from punk to adult contemporary, embrace the World Beat, and is an IT guy on Wall Street. I believe this gentleman is advanced.
Alice Cooper has been added to the "Rock Through Time" concert, sponsored by Miller Brewing Company. Melissa Auf Der Maur is another recent addition. This is good advanced technique: corporate-sponsored concert and appearing with an overt artist.
According to  urlLink billboard.com , Damon Albarn is working with Fela Kuti. He describes it as "the most exciting thing I've ever been involved in." Embracing World Music is a sign of advancement. I'll keep my eye on Mr. A
