just FINDS ways to make problems and starts fights.  (sigh)  Since homicide is not an option, I just have to sit and wait for the day when we close on the house and he's out of my life.
This morning my brothers and I went to see our lawyer for my grandmother's house.  We went there to a) have a mediator and b) finalize what we're going to do...  I tell ya, having the lawyer there REALLY helped me personally from feeling stuck in the middle or singled out.  Also, the fact that the lawyer is a friend and as clever as a whip doesn't hurt either.  ;-)  Anyway, what we've established is this:  We will sell the house.  Offer it first to the people living there and if they are not interested move onto a broker who will help us with the sale.  Sure his commission is high, but all of this money is basically money we never had before, so if we have to pay it out, so be it.  Same goes for the Capital Gain taxes we'll be paying.  Who cares?  We never had this money in the first place, so if we have to shell it out to The Man, oh well.  Hopefully this process won't take very long and none of us are shelling money out of our own pockets to maintain the house in the interim.  When all is said and done, we'll be out of debt to the creditors, I wont have to deal with my asshole brother, and I will be able to grieve properly.  Speaking of my brother...in case anyone was curious, he's still being an asshole, just not so much to me.  Now he's moved onto my other brother and his lifestyle.  No, he's not gay, he's just a clothes horse and likes to spend a lot.  But really, what business of it is his?  Fucker.  I can't WAIT until this is all over, man.  Daaaamn.
Just came from the movies.  Saw The Village with Ron Howard's kid and River Phoenix's brother.  (hee hee)      It was pretty good, actually! I mean, the most interesting thing about it - and I'm not going to give away the plot or anything - is the fact that it's less based on the supernatural than Shyamalan's previous movies... which kinda makes it that much cooler.      Go see it.      And that's all I'm going to say about that.
I am truly one to admit when I don't understand something. So here it goes.
Okay so remember when I talked about the whole 'tough love' thing?  It seems that someone else has joined me in the mix... but only AFTER my friend says she's ready to leave.
There is so much going on right now I am starting to feel overwhelmed again.  I hate it when you just want something to be over that you're almost willing to give up your share of everything just to be left alone.  However, in reality, how dumb would that be?
Today is Steve's birthday.  Everyone tell him Happy Birthday!!  Go on.  It's okay.  He'll like i
