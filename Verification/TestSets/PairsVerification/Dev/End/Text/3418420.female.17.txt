it's almost over. Thank God, I need a break. I mean, the class is fun (who ever would've thought you could earn credit for watching Law and Order?) but I need sleep. Bad. Eh, c'est la vie. Oh, that reminds me, I haven't decided on next years schedule yet.  I'm taking: Honors Spanish III, Academic Decathlon, Psychology and Biology/PE. I need one more class and i can't decide between choir or French I. I'm going to audition for regional choir and American Idol this year so I guess I should choose choir but in reality, I'm going to be a cop... Fuck singing, I need more languages to get in the to FBI. I'm so confused, shit. Oh well, screw it all.  I'll figure it out the day of classes, lol.  This Thursday I'm going to Vegas! YAY! I can't wait. I plan on getting terribly drunk, finding some random hot guys to make out with and shopping until my bank card is broken. That's the life. We're staying at the Excalibur, it'll be so much fun! I'm so excited! The shopping and tanning are what I most look forward to. I need a tan, but my thighs are getting a bit too big, I haven't been exercising enough. Eh, oh well.  All in all, I have a pretty okay few weeks. A few mom issues and I'm going to kill my dad but other than that, it's good. I'll leave you with the lyrics to my new favorite (extremely depressing) song.
