We went and picked her up and the boys decided they wanted to go see Thunderbirds. We dropped them off there and went to S II.  THAT MOVIE WAS GAY!!!  i got so incredibly bored that i was counting how many times Toby McGuire--w/e his name is--blinked. we left w/ about 45 minutes left.

She brought over her yearlong class video thing. it was pretty cool. i got to see a guy on the poms squad. i didnt know guys could be that flexible. lol Ya wanna know something? i cant wait for school to start. i miss all my friends and i wanna see all the new kids that i can brainwash. . . . i mean make friends with. dude, it should be cool this year. i aint a freshman no more and i love watching people gossip about me. last year it was that i was a lesbian, that i killed someone--or tried to, and that i had a hit list. none of the above were true tho. i was more pissed about the lesbian thing than the psycho thing. i like people being scared of me, i aint got no shit to worry about. well i should go i wanna go check out that manson site. if ya wanna check it out the address for it is:  urlLink http://www.angelfire.com/ny/dementio/    layter people!
