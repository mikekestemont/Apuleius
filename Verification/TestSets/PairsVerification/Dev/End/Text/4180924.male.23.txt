is that I can't decide which shirt I want --  urlLink this one  or perhaps  urlLink this one . Maybe both if the paycheck is good enough next week. But it won't be.  There are also lots of funny shirts at  urlLink ebaynham.com  (Thanks,  urlLink LawDawg , for that one. It was a banner in the email you sent last week).  Yes, I am THAT bored.
Despite the terrible grammatical form displayed in the title, some form of brewed delight is on the menu for dinner tonight. I thought I would do a little research into the wonderful world of beer. I found a great website that ranks beers (I think B told me about it the other night) called  urlLink Beer Advocate.com .  I've been a bit poor for the last 23 years of my life. My more recent dealings with poverty have driven me into the realm of drinking Southpaw Light, which is just about the best cheap beer out there at $5.99 a 12-pack (in bottles, at that).  Here are some beer scores that my research has uncovered:  Sam Adams Boston Ale - 86 Sam Adams Boston Lager - 85 PBR - 75 Schlitz - 75 Miller High Life - 74 Southpaw Light - 73 Steel Reserve (211 High Gravity)- 71 Schlitz Malt Liquor Bull - 68 Budweiser - 67  How, in the name of Eberhard Anheuser & Adolphus Busch, did Budweiser score lower than PBR, High Life, Southpaw, Steel Reserve, Schlitz, and even Schlitz Malt Liquor Bull? Wow people have some bad taste...literally.  PBR is almost undrinkable, even for my poverty-stricken beer-loving taste buds. Steel Reserve? It's one of the most unpalatable brews my taste buds have ever had the displeasure of experiencing! And High Life? The champagne of beers? I don't think so, Tim.  Anyway, interesting stuff there...yet, at the same time, perplexing.  (And for the part of me that longs for England:) Belhaven Scottish Ale - 85 Guinness - 85 Bass Pale Ale - 83 Old Speckled Hen - 82 Boddington's Pub Ale - 80 John Courage - 79 Stella Artois - 79  Old Speckled Hen does not taste good from a can in the States. It just doesn't. On tap at the Turf Tavern pub in Oxford, England, however, it's awesome. All of the others I listed are great on tap there, too, but many of them are actually drinkable in America.
The Republicans can no longer complain about Hillary Clinton running for US Senate in New York while being a resident of Arkansas. Since  urlLink Barack Obama's excellent speech at the DNC  went over so well, the Republicans have been scrambling to find a candidate to oppose Obama's run for US Senate. That search has stopped at  urlLink Allan Keyes' back door ...in Maryland.  Yes, the same party that complained incessantly about Hillary Clinton's run for Senate has now done the same thing. Nice job there, Republicans. Silly me, I thought John Kerry was the " urlLink King of Flip Flops ."  And this move doesn't scream "We're running scared" to me. Not at a
