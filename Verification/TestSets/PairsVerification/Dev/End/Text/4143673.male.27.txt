my way to a poker game.  That counts doesn't it.  Now most of them just think I'm crazy for playing cards and can't understand gambling at all.  Any thoughts on this topic?  Can you meet girls while playing poker?  So what's new for me.  My buddy Casey and I just booked our rooms for Harrah's in New Orleans.  I live in Houston TX, originally from Oregon, so heading over to New Orleans should be fun.  I've already been over there 2 times this year and am really looking forward to the vacation.  I am really going to focus on just playing poker, as a trip to the Casino can be an expensive one for me.   Last time I went to New Orleans I was stuck for $1600 before hitting a really hot streak around 4AM at the $100 table playing Black Jack and cashed for $4000, netting me a $2600 profit.  I bought these really cool painting while I was there so I really didn't take that much home but it was a blast.  And the good thing about this is that I'm now pretty much comped to whatever I want at Harrah's mostly due to dropping some large sums there after I got laid off.  I had a trip to Vegas that left me $3000 poorer and they seem to know they can count on me leaving a grand or so of my hard earned money, on any trip.  But at least my room is free.  So, I like to gamble, it's no secret, but this whole poker thing seems to have givin me a way to get my gambling fix and atleast not lose money.  Back to this whole weekend trip thing.  I'm really going to try not to lose to much at the tables, even though I know as I write this I'm not going to be able to avoid the tables all together, that lure of the big hit still is with me.  I think it all stems back to a big, and big to me is almost $10,000 win.  I've done it once but managed to dump most of it back over the next severall trips and I know that I'm probably down that much over my life, playing blackjack, but you never know maybe this trip will be it.  I highly doubt it as I'm going to try and limit myself to a couple of hundred bucks for BJ and a couple of hundred for poker and a couple hundred for fun.  I've got to save up because my same buddy Casey is getting married in the fall and his Bachelor party is in Vegas in September.  Thats going to be expensive I can tell already.  Well that's the first issue of the Peanuts, and I'll probably be on later to tell you about any poker that I play between now and this weekend, I hope that this was a good intro, I'm really not much of a writter but this was kind of fun.
