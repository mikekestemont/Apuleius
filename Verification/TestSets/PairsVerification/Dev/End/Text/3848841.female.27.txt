of them.
I'm like a vending machine. I'm temporarily out of service.
Thought I would entertain you people on the meaning of my title. I am actually unborn, yes that is right i'm still in the womb fighting to stay. I can hear everything from in here. Sounds like a shit hole to me.  Each day goes by and it gets harder and harder to stay.  My cozy home is getting tighter and tighter.  The pressure is unbearable.  I take my trusty rope that is attatched to my bellybutton, lasso it around her precious heart and cling on for dear life.
I open my arms to death. I search for the big Grim Reaper. Death is always one step behind us. Welcome it.  I welcome death. What is taking so damn long?
The pain that I have is unbearable
Couldn't stay away, this page is the only way that I have release from all the shit.

I'm like a sliding glass door One minute I am open The next I am slammed shut Only to be broken into pieces.
Tears falling down my checks They seem to come everyday Hate that they make me so weak.  Trying to understand Longing to be hand in hand uncontrollable they are Unable to stop.  Wet and salty Dry and damp The one last drop Will be the end.
Tired of being me, plain and ugly.  Tired of being me, short and chunky.  Tired of being me, light skin, and freckles.  Tired of being me, so unhappy.  Tired of my skin that I am in.
NEEDING  LONGING  YEARNING  WISHING  WAITING  WANTING
I'm not out to hurt him I tore his world apart Now he walks around with a broken heart.  Frown upon his face Darkness in his eyes All he wants now is to leave this place.  To tell him i'm sorry, will do no good He wants to hate me So the hate I understood.  One day he will find where his road leads, rather it's with me or it's to be f
