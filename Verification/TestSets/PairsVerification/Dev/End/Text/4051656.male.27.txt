finish this one with a positive vibe, I may work on something more complex. For now, here's a little sample.
urlLink CNN reports  that the "talent" portion of the Miss America pagents is to be discontinued. To me and probably a lot of feminists, this should spell the end for the Miss America pageant. Without the talent portion, this contest is solely about looks. A beauty pageant. I'm not going to rehash all the old arguements about why beauty pageants are bad, but I'm definitely going to be paying attention to the feminist community following this decision. I bet we start to hear cries of "cease and desist" from them soon.
urlLink Reuters   is reporting that Kerry plans to send no more troops and in fact bring some home, if elected. From the article: Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry said on Sunday he did not anticipate sending more American troops to Iraq and hoped to bring "significant numbers" home during his first term. Promising a fresh start with U.S. allies "burned" by President Bush, Kerry said, "I would consider it an unsuccessful policy if I hadn't brought significant numbers of troops back within the first term. And I will do that."  If this isn't just a campaign ploy, it's the best thing I've heard from the Kerry camp so far. Of course, I don't really think that's the case. I think this is Kerry trying to get more votes. The lack of details is telling. He also says, "during his first term," which means 2008 at the latest. 4 years is a long time. The war in Iraq has only been on for a little more than one year. Having troops home 4 years from now isn't that great a goal, but at least it's a start. Maybe he's starting to realize that his luke-warm approach to us isn't working too well. We'll see.
I had a great idea for a blog entry this morning as I was coming to work, and now I can't remember what it was. Time to start carrying around a notebook.
This weekend, I went out to my parents place. They've got about 80 acres out in the Ozark Mountains. It's a beautiful place. Anyway, I went out there this weekend to see the progress of the house they're building out there. When I got there, there were about 20 or 30 cows mooing their way up to the house. They were still in the field for the most part, but some of them had made it up to the yard and out-buildings. Now, my parents don't have any livestock, so these cows have broken through a fence somewhere and made it on to our property without any guidance. No one was around, so I took it upon myself to herd the cows out of and away from the yard. So, I'm out there whooping and hee-yah'ing like I imagine a real cowboy would. I'm sure I looked ridiculous in my Hawaiian shirt and no horse, but I sure felt like a real cowboy, if only for a few m
