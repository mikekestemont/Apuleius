2 p.m. ^^ Went home late the other night... at 3 am I think.... Played basketball, soccer, kickball.... Woke up with a sore body... hahahaa... decided to sleep again :P Hmm... dunno why but I wanted to go to church yesterday. Went to church and the first thing I did was kneel in front of Mother Mary and shared with her all my troubles. When I'm done, I noticed smthg... I was actually crying... for no reason at all... Felt better though... My first cry this year... After church, we went to grab dinner at Joo Joo in Hana market... Didn't really eat... No appetite... Saw Daranee with her three friends and I was like .... WOw hahahaa... Then another familiar face appeared... Mbeekkkk.... hahahaha... surprisingly Dolly and friends were there too... Couldn't notice the rest though... Went home, did my laundry and then slept... Boring huh??!! -_-"" I thought so too... Neways gotta do my hw now... Wish me all the best and pray for me k... THX hahha...

Wah gile... udah August man... Can't believe I've spent 2 months in States... Semakin lama semakin cepet aja... Tahun ini gak kerasa banget... It's too fast to be true... Apa cuman gua yg merasa begini? Kayanya baru satu bulan gitu eh... tiba tiba udah August... I can still remember the first day of school in ACJC.. hahhaha... bener deh... things just happens too fast.. Maybe I'm too occupied with work -_-"" gotta take time to reflect and collate my thoughts... Hmmm... cuman rasanya aneh banget man... selama gua di States gua udah jarang mikirin keluarga gua lagi disono :( bahaya nih... drifting further and further apart.. gak kaya waktu gua di sg... hahaha.. masih kangen ama Mom and Dad... well I dunno man.. is this what they say when there would be a time when a man would leave their parents? Maybe... well I still think I'm immature at times... hahahaha... gotta grow up fast.. learn how to take care of myself... Well guess that's all I have to say for today... hahaha.. finals coming... Gotta get perfect A's for both subject... kalo gak bisa BT gua... ^^ too ambitious? Of course not.. I know my limits and my capabilities... I'm sure that A is mine... Hmm.. I can almost taste it right now... hahaha... the sweetness of victory... ;) Well my goals are the things that keeps me going... Kayanya tanpa goals, my life would be worthless... hmm... guess I gotta find a greater goal then ;) hehehe... Jya ne!~ Wish me luck for my exams k... thanks...
