They look like sisters but they arent kin at all. They are the same age (mid 30s) and both have kids etc.  They both are so nice, really kind, religious, and overall very good people to work with. I have this problem though.... when im with them i often find myself joining in on their conversations and some of the things that come out of my mouth lately have made us all laugh like hell. One of the ladies has 3 kids, one does mary kay, avon, whatever the hell it is, one breast pumps her milk or whatever the fuck thats called and overall they are your prototype MOMs. They talk about arts and crafts, church, babies, things babies do, other peoples babies, and all kinda mom talk. They make beaded bracelets, exchange recipes, look at pottery barn magazines together, and just totally fill the role of Mothers well im sure.  Well they have rubbed off on me..... badly.  I have found myself in their conversations talking about what product exfoliates better, which SPF is best for the baby, which salad dressing is better tasting, and of all things...... Yes... I, Jason Rogers, made a little beaded bracelet last night. They were laughing that here i was, in the mix of these moms, making a beaded bracelet with their kits.... yes, kits. They have bead kits they get at hobby lobby. These girls are great. Ill miss them when im gone. They both have lucky husbands and children for they are virtuous women and even the non religious Jason knows that the bible says what a treasure a virtuous woman is. I even held one of the ladies's baby (youngest one) at a staff meeting the other night. So sweet...... ok i need sleep and or therapy/medication / caffeine :-p  Jason
UGH why wont UAB  call me damnet?!?!!!  So the update is this..... im hired as of today IF my background checks out OK. Im not sure what that consist of, but thats what im waiting on. Im not sure if thats like criminal background or past employers or both or what :( I cant get over the fact that i could lose this oppurtunity becasue of a certain past employer and criminal record (hey she SAID she was 18...... just kidding :-p ) SO anyhow, the people in CT are done with me saying i am hired IF only HR checks out. Did i mention i HATE HR after my situation in St Louis???? :-(  Anyhow, thats the deal..... thats the update, not to fabulous but oh well. Thats whats going on with me. I really dont care what happens as long as i raise up outta here and fast.  I cant take this place much longer. Springfield is ok, the hospital is not :(  I miss my girlfriend, shes far far away..... that is all i really wanna say about that right now without being all emotional and sad and stuff. I call her voicemail and leave messages just so i can hear HI YOU HAVE REACHED HANEEN!!  J
