poof its gone because i clicked on something on accident. an now im not motivated anymore... im fustrated!
i wish that this world would b perfect...that we would never b sad...that we would never hafta shed a tear... i wish that our favorite memories would last forever...or that we could go back to them whenever we wanted to... i wish that  everything would always b okie...that there would b no such thing as money that could make us greedy or whatever... i wish that there would never b any arguing...that we could all live in harmony... those r jus a FEW of my many wishes that are NEVER gonna come true.
