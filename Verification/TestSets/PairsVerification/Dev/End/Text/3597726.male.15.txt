to my heart...EXTREMELY close to my heart...yes...I did get a haircut. haha. jk. I mean, yeah, I did. I'm still getting used to it. Its like shorter than my friend austin's hair...  Still working on my novel, and I got some real sweet ideas. The main character's partner is going to be a vampire. Its going to be so fun.   I'm going to publish this post before it gets to long...
I'm leaving at 11 for the movie. It starts at like 11:30, but it onlyt takes like 7 minutes to get there...so, yeah. THats what I'll be doing soon.   I'm basicly done with my song. I'll probably add a part after one part to make it sound better and to make the song longer. Maybe I'll post the lyrics on here...  Oh, yeah.  Mental note:   Be sure to pray for Trey and his friend. He hasn't told me who she is because I know her and she threatened to commit suicide. So there's someone with her 24/7. Its pretty sad...but she needs prayer. So please pray for her...because she needs it...  I'm working on a website with www.freewebs.com right now. Its pretty cool. I'd like to get more options. But, hey, what do you expect from a free website program. Its not bad. I think I'm getting used to it. The address to the site I'm working on is... www.freewebs.com/mattswritings so check it out...Its under construction right now, but you can go there and see it if you feel up to it...  I have to take out teddy, so catch ya'll later...
ok, I know...That was like the lamest title ever, but its all history now. And so was that sentence. As was that sentence. Yeah, I think that was even lamer.  Well, I'm going to definately work on some stuff for the novel tonight. Hope to get alot done. I'm seeing Spiderman 2 tomorrow with some friends...Trey, Dana, and Droo. I already read the book, so I already know what happens, but I'm still dying to see it.  Also, the ESSIGS left for columbus today to see family. Daniel hitched a ride with them too...so I have the room to myself. Gee, I already miss him.  I really feel like writing stuff about my novel idea on here, but alot of it has to just be stuffed together menatally. I don't know...I keep having different ideas...I thinjk I should write them all down and compare them sometimes...  Oh, yeah. the first Silence Effect fan site was created yesterday by Joey Squire. Its really cool. check it out at... www.freewebs.com/sefan Yeah, its pretty sweet...  Well, gotta run. Keep rockin...
I though about my novel a lot yesterday. I figured some cool things out. I want the main character to have a low life with no family or friends. But i'm not sure if someone should find her or she should find them. Ya know? Well, Bethany really ants to get on and i know that was a really lame and short post, but I need to run...I promise to post more later t
