a sack' with your co-workers. I really do work with boys. Not men, boys. However, I'm not sure I'd have it any other way.  Joe brought his girlfriend. She fell off her shoes and broke her foot. I kinda feel bad, cause it probably hurt, but...they weren't even cute shoes. What straight girls go through for 'fashion'.  I'm sure there's something else to update you on, but I don't really have much of a brain at the moment. Work is really messing with my ability to think of anything other than HFM specifications. *sigh*

Once again with the 'I suck'. This is totally inappropriate and totally mean. However, I couldn't not save it *somewhere*.   You know you're Jan-Harm when...  Your voicemail greeting message is so long, you feel it's necessary to remind people they're listening to a message. Blowing your nose requires an above average intake of carbohydrates. The new box of tissues you brought in that morning is gone by 10am. You think whining is an appropriate way to ask for help. You create annoying nicknames for your co-workers. It's important for your yogurt to be well shook and that not a single drop be wasted. You use words and phrases like 'jeepers', 'on the farm' and 'that's retarded'. When communicating that you understand, you find it necessary to say 'sure' twice. Since sometimes people look like they don't believe you. You answer questions by repeating random words within a co-workers statement. You spend vaulable work hours hanging out by the vending machines or in the bathroom. Filling out your time card is an all day affair. And....I haven't come up with the zinger that goes at the end of these lists...so, this will just have to do for now.  Perhaps I'll add to it later...
Wow...I totally missed my own blogging anniversay. I suck.  Here's to the 3 years past and the many years (months? weeks?) to come!
I really have to stop blogging at work....though I guess that will have start tomorrow. Since, well, you know.  Usually I don't have time to think, let alone put thoughts down on virtual paper. So in a way, his is a happy time. In the end however, I think I'd rather be busy. A busy Becky is a happy Becky. A bit of a stress-monkey perhaps, but happy nonetheless.  You know what else makes for a very happy Becky? JH is taking a week long vacation starting Monday. Woo! No more nose blowing, no more asinine questions, no more eye rolling or huffing or licking the top of the yogurt container or him calling me 'Becks'. For that week anyway....so *very* exciting.  Ok, back to the grind. Counting how many time JH blows his nose is hard work...
The world seems void of intelligent people. Then, you run into that one person that makes you have faith in the rest of humanity. That is until you meet that other person whose sheer stupidity starts the cycle all over a
