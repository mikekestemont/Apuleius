good food, but when I actually got to eat I really couldn't believe how good it was. Somehow everything was perfect- the pita was warm, the tomatos were ripe, the tzatziki sauce was divine. Yum! It was a great lunch.  Apparently my stomach had a different opinion about the whole thing. By 1:00pm, I started feeling... well, gross. At first I thought it was all in my head. Maybe I was just nervous about being at a new job, or maybe I ate too much. I kept trying to talk myself out of feeling so sick, but waves of nausea kept washing over me. By 2:00pm I couldn't deny that I was ill, but I didn't want to leave early on my second day at work. I had never called in sick throughout the entire 2 years I spent at my last job, and I wasn't about to start now!  By 2:30 it was obvious that there was no turning back. A coworker was at my desk in the process of explaining something to me, and I practically bowled her over in my rush to the bathroom. I couldn't believe this was happening! As I ran/walked/hopped toward the bathroom in my heels, I realized there was no way I could make it to the bathroom. Thankfully I was passing the receptionist's desk (she wasn't there!), and I spotted a gloriously large trashcan. Hallelujah! I proceeded to vomit a venerable cornucopia of Greek cuisine in the middle of the hallway. Embarrassed, I tried to keep moving to the bathroom, hugging my beloved trashcan and stumbling down the hall while throwing up (I'm a multi-tasker!). I finally made it to the bathroom and continued (I'll spare the details), until I was finally able to stand and walk straight. I smoothed my hair, emptied the trashcan, and tried to muster up whatever dignity I had left. I gracefully embarked on the long Walk of Shame back to the office.  Needless to say, I was mortified. My boss looked a bit horrified when I returned, and he insisted that I go home. I did what any reasonable person would do and tried to play it off like I was totally fine. He didn't buy it for a second (smart man!), and sent me home after assuring me about a dozen times that it was ok and he understood that I was sick. I felt terrible! Of all the things NOT to do on your second day at work, I'm pretty sure getting sick is one of them!  Luckily I was fully recovered by the next day, although a bit humiliated. I am fortunate to work with some really easy-going people, so thankfully they were very nice and sympathetic. I was very happy to put the whole thing behind me. I am happy to report that I have worked an entire three weeks without a similar incident!  This would not be the last foil in our California adventure, however.
