goodbye.
Slacking at my job. The tea lady (i think) just sprayed some weird air freshner thing and I am gagging like a chipmunk. hyuk hyuk hyuk. next year i am definetly not gonna pick an office job. and I defintely do not see myself working (10 years down the road) in some white... boring, old office with like cabinets full of weird folders. nnnnno. never. I see myself up on a stage with Hilary and Colleen by my side rocking to the sounds of Le Blachi Cameleons. HA HA HA. either that or running around killing rats. WACHA! speaking of the band, hilary go check our blog, unless you havent done so already. i have laid out a brilliant plan ahead of us. MWA HA HA HA HA HA.  anyway, plan for the day. finish up my work here, wait till mom calls, go out for lunch (with mom). AHH. I'm sure it will be a real bonding experience = I hope we go someplace nice. I am so very bored, and hungry. Okay I should probably get off this before I get murdered.
MWA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA   im really sick though for some reason. ive got a bad cold. really bad. i sound like hilary duff eveytime i try to sing. ahhh this bites.  ive written a new song though! love it. i think i'll call it 'Different' but i dont know yet.  going to put on a movie.
random laughing.  a weird song is playing on the radio. must turn it off.  anyway yes, sudden obsession for michelle branch. i want to be the next her. and I also wanna butcher Nicole from the Amazing Race and force her boyfriend (Brandon) to marry me. I love Nicole and all but ya know, a girl has gotta do what she's gotta do.  hehehe.  now they're playing "who let the dogs out". must start to look for a new radio station to listen to. *plugs ears and runs and hides*
I'm incredibly bored and I feel like singing a song. Why do people like to call themselves pimps? I dont get it. So I spent the last hour watching Wonderwoman. it is such a cheesy show. honestly. and its like 400 years old.  You know what I should really do? Nothing. My life is a mess here. well not really. Justin came over again. and lets just say something interesting happened. boys are truly weird. C'est tres stupide. Love is, that is.  I need to go for a skate. I really do.  Did I ever mention that DJ's are weird? Maybe I should be a Dj. i mean, i AM weird.
"Can't change the way I am, Sexy, Naughty, Bitchy, ME" AHHHHHHH nooo. she just HAS to go all international with a song like that. honestly. what a disgrace to asians. haha no just joking. i love tata young. hmm yes.  ooo friends is on. got to go. i think phoebe is going to get "married" in this one. who knows. you never know in f
