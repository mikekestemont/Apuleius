lucky enough to be alive or resurrected when Jesus came back would live forever in the new Earth.  If you weren't one of these lucky ones you were either in the 144,000 people that would get into Heaven or you were left to sleep for eternity.  But no Hell.  We've had conversations about the Trinity (he's a Binitarian.)  We've talked about works and grace.  Some of the things we've agreed on and others we haven't but we always have very good conversations.  The other guy is, from what I can gather, a non-denominational, full-gospel type guy.  We've had several conversations about several things and we usually agree.  But there is something different about him that I find disturbing.  Every time we talk he has a way about him that says, "I'm right and anyone who doesn't agree is hellbound."  He has this air of superiority about him that makes me want to vomit.  Even thought I may agree with what he's saying, the way in which he says it turns my stomach.  The JW will talk to me and answer my questions.  He'll show me where he thinks I'm wrong and try to get me to see his point of view.  The full-gospel guy does the same but there's a huge difference in the two.  The JW, no matter how wrong I think he is, always seems as though he truly cares about me and my search for truth.  He takes the time to share with me what he knows and it's always done in love.  Love.  This is the difference between the two.  Whether the JW's theology is totally screwed up or not, I think he's closer to the character of Jesus than the full-gospel guy who would rather scream damnation at someone than buy them a meal and love them.  Far be it from him to show compassion for someone that doesn't line up with his doctrine.    It makes me wonder what God thinks of these two men.  I wonder if God sees the heart of the men and it overshadows their doctrinal miscalculations.  I wonder if God weeps when His words come out of a mans mouth coupled with hatred.  I wonder if God smiles when a mislead man with a good heart does everything he knows to do to show Jesus' love to another human being.  I wonder what He'll say to each of them when it's all said and done.

There's this thing that pastors do when they need affirmation and crave audience participation. I'm sure you've heard your pastor say something like, "And all God's children said...," and the congregation says, "Amen." Or maybe your pastor likes to get you to play Fill-In-The-Blank. He'll read a scripture and you'll follow along until he stops reading and then you all say the word that he stops on in unison.  Whenever my pastor does this I usually lean over to my wife and say in my best brainwashed zombie voice, "Must drink the K
