one costs well over $1000, which in my student days was an insane amount of cash. Then there's the issue of finding one. The ones they carried at Music Folk were crappy entry-level student models. So I'd have to order one online if I really wanted one. But recently I've discovered an intriguing alternative: the electric sitar! Yes, it's basically a guitar that has been made to sound buzzy like a sitar. And it turns out that many of those classic recordings from the '60s actually used an electric sitar rather than a real one. So, I've now become quite fixated on acquiring one of these instruments. There are 3 options: one, find an old original Danelectro electric sitar on eBay (good luck with allll that!); two, buy a Rogue brand replica from Musicians Friend for $300 (supposedly they are pretty junky); three, buy a Jerry Jones handmade replica for $700 (bingo!). Yes, I totally need a Jerry Jones electric sitar. That would be soooooo sweet! Eddie's Guitars has one in stock. I must go there this week and try it out. And after I acquire such an instrument, I may wake in the early morning to improvise my own ragas in their electrified glory.
Does talking in rhymes over generated beats consistute music?  I suppose it does, but just barely in my book.  I've tried listening to some of the 'good' rap music out there, and although I could listen to it for extended periods without turning it off, I just couldn't get in to it.  First off, I need to have some real instruments in my music - real guitars, real drums, real bass.  When all of the music is generated by digital means, it really sounds cold and lifeless to my ears (I guess that's why I dislike most pop music of the '80s, too).  Second, I dislike the fact there isn't a vocal melody to wrap my ears around (try whistling the 'melody' to a 50 Cent or Chingy song - it can't be done!).  Finally, I really can't relate to the lyrics of most rap artists.   I grew up in a upper-middle class suburb, so I can't say I know much about pimps, hos, or popping caps into a brother's ass.   Where's my Figure 8 CD at?  Ah, there it is...much better...
Why did I buy this bag of pork rinds? I try to eat healthy foods, but for some reason I was compelled to buy a bag of them while at the gas station. The whole concept is quite disgusting - who originated the idea in the first place? They must have been starving or something.  Yet, at the same time, I can't stop eating them this afternoon.  I should just throw away the remaining skins.  No!  I cannot resist their crunchy, weird tastiness!  I need to try those salt and vinegar ones next time.  I bet those are really tasty.  And they are Atkins approved.  Which means that you can eat as many of them as you want, and live a long heathly life - r
