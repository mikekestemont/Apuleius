life!  Now, I say I want to go into Graphic Design or Psychology, but what if thats really not what I want?  Then I would be wasting time and money going to a "big" school studying that!    Me and Karina went to the mall because she had to buy a skirt from Aero!  It is so cute, its they white skirt I wanted, but my mom wouldn't let me get because she said it was to short and skanky!  Aww, that made me a bit sad, but oh well!  There are so many cute clothes I want, I need to get a job or money or something!  I was thinking about taking money from my parents, but AHH, most of us know what happend last time I did that and I really don't want to get caught again!  Eeek! After the mall we went to Jewel because Karina had to buy supplies for making cookies for her Excel class!  As I was walking in I was pretty sure that I saw Rachel, Amanda, Alex, and some other people leaving!  I wanted to run up to Rachel and give her a hug, but then I decided not to because I didn't want to see Amanda or Alex because we all know how much I'm hated!  Aww, :o(  Anyways, I made sure Karina bought all cheap stuff to make the cookies becuase I didn't want her to waste her money on people none of us care about!  I saved her MUCHO money!  We did the self check out thing and it was so much fun!  The machine detected an "unknown object" in the bad area and it made me  laugh because the unknown object was my hand!  HAHA!  Then we drove home and I kept the bag safe, because I didn't want the eggs to break!  Karina dropped me off at home and I seat belted the bag of grocerys into the front seat, just to keep them safe!  HA, wow . . . I'm such a loser!  When I got home my dad went psycho on me and made me do yard work!  It made me mad because I need to clean my room because I have pink fluff all over my carpet, and everywhere is covered in clothes and it is really pissing me off!  So I guess I was a little bitchy towards him, but not enough to get cranky over!  Well, anyways ... my mom said that I made my dad cry and I don't understand what I could have done that is that bad!  I mean all I did is be cranky when he asked me to help with yard work, no big deal!   Well, then my mom told me that my dad is "sad" because he really thinks that I should be able to have a brand new car, because when he was my age his dad (( my grandpa )) bought him a really nice car!  I felt bad for being a bitch, I'm going to say I'm sorry when he gets home!  Ok, buh b
