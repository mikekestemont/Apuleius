to 3D2N group instructor. More work = More PAY = hopefully MORE FUN.   Going MIA for the next 2 days liao ...cheerios  Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know
Went for a mini-gathering at yiyong's hse today. Quite fun though....knowing everyone is healthy and well. Saw edward in crutches though...reminds me of the time i had my ankle operation and had to be in crutches too. Neber easy to move ard.   Watched Wimbeldon ladies Singles final there. Quite an interesting match watching with the friends. From the way they cheered, it will not be surprising if yiyong's neighbour thought Euro Finals started early. We nearly played POLAR BEAR today....too bad tennis took over before we even started....memorable game played in cambodia....heehee.....maybe next time i can use this game as a wet weather programme for my camps....hahahah  Spoke to the girls and they seem very curious and envious that kan wee and me are holding different jobs so different from what they are studying, Medicine. Quite possibly, the impression given was that our jobs are more interesting than what they are doing now and in the future. Future doctors ( dull, boring, no life job... :P). I would not want to make a comparison here but there is always this cycle. We are envious that these people are going to be future doctors that is going to earn big bucks in the future and they are envious that we are holding such interesting jobs ( with low pathetic pay). We can have the most interesting jobs in the world but we would not know where our next meal is coming from and vice versa....the trade off is there. Guessed just have to accept our "chosen" paths and make the best out of it. Anyway, who says we cant cross paths even when the routes are different??? Team Sangkhim is a very good example. If it can be done here, it can be done in the working world in the future  Supposed to meet celin and kaixiang for a drink at pasir ris but i was unable to make it down to pasir ris in time. Too bad lor...until next time.   Wasn't feeling well today....i doono how to say but the place below the sternum has this burning sensation ....not the first time liao .....i think is i neber eat enough for dinner. Tempted to buy some food on the way home but when i reached the kopitiam, i doono why i managed to control myself from ordering the food. Sad case...got to hunt the kitchen for food again.
