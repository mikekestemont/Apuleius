and i need answers for two unanswered questions, are we friends, becaused lately it hasent seemed like it,,, Do you really like me?..................
I really like her, she means so much to me and she cant see that....... She dosent think shes pretty, thats not true why would she think that. Shes a great person......
The reason why i hide the real me is because of what people would say, today i found out that people do say things, things that make me feel so much worse, i also found out that friends will understand and everyone else will say things,, the only thing that kept me together today was a quote from the book Atlas Shrugged- "Do not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark, in the hopeless swamps of the not-quite, the not-yet, the not-at-all. Do not let the hero in your soul perish, in lonely frustration for the life you deserved, but have never been able to reach. The world you desired can be won, it exists, it is real, it is possible, it's yours."
in my last post i said i was going to stop my blog but i cant this is the only way i can get everything out. most of time it easier to write it down then to tell someone.  Over the past week i guess i put my life on hold while she was gone, i like her alot and she dosent feel the same way,, i have been quetioning alot of things,, are we friends, i dont know thinking back to winter were we spent months not talking and friends dont do that, friends cant do that.... Every day i feel like i dont belong in rural ridge, and nearly every day somthing happens that keeps me knowing that i dont belong here.......... Every day is find out what i can and can not do, every day i push my self to the limit know the risks and not careing and i do it because i think i can relieve the sadness im feeling, i cant play basketball and know i can play a few weeks ago i could and i know why i cant play its because im play for all the wrong reasons i was playing it because it was fun now i play it to get my mind on somthing else, to not be sad..... Every day i leave with out telling anyone, i leave because i started thinking and im not thinking any happy thoughts................ the music i listen to isnet helping i listen to that describes how i feel and who i am................
i have decided to stop my blog or at least for awhile, when life is at its worst its easy for me just to write down how i feel but right now i think i have to work it out in person...................................
Kristen can read me like a book, i have been unhappy. Its because i have this feeling that kristen dosent really want to be with me,, i want to be with her, i love h
