why do we run around force feeding our large doses of insecurity on others?  Besides looking at the last 50 years who has desecrated the 'sanctity of marriage' more than HETER-O-SEXUALS?  Sexy Chocolate!!!

I'm staring out of the bay window of my apartment wondering about the human experience. For three days I have craved nothing more than getting out of this apartment and doing something constructive, yet I have spent the entire time inside.   Why do we go against what is best for us? I know tomorrow when I'm back at work I will hate having not used my time more wisely. I'm looking at a list of things I need to do right now including a story I need to finish and yet I am not doing those things.   I have had the desire to write in this blog for months and though I could come up with anything to write about I used the excuse that I had no time. Like now I am using the blog as a way to ignore the list sitting in front of me.   I guess it's a cycle of procrastination that catches up with us. As the backlog grows longer we begin to shorten it in an effort to avoid it all together. Amazing. I have a wonderful article about Gastro By-Pass Surgery that I will be posting. Not right now though, maybe later.
In approximately 2hours and 15 minutes my Monday morning work day will be decided. BellSouth currently in talks with Communications Workers of America is reluctant in spending another 1 billion dollars per year for the next three years.  Talks between the union and BellSouth have been slow because of job security and health care.  BellSouth wants employees to pay a monthly premium for their insurance and in term they will increase salaries by one percent.  Job security BellSouth says is up to the BellSouth customers, that position I actually agree with. At last reporting BellSouth had changed its last proposal. Employees were instructed on Friday to make everything all nice and comfy for the managers coming in having to do the peons work.  Techs leave your trucks gassed up, reps check your voicemails, leave our badges don't give us any greif you little ingrates.  Will I strike? I will. If for no other reason than I need a mini - legal -vacation. I can take a lot but being that my main job is to create revenue for the company so the manager hierchy can live far more comfortable than I am presently, I feel they have no room for complaining. Maybe after a few hours of doing the job (again, in some cases) they will see or remember that.  Realistically I feel with Time Warner's new digital phone service being released and BellSOuth going into Satellite tv they can not afford the bad press. It won't look good that the big bad company won't keep paying for health benefits for it's employees. So all odds point to me having to go to work monday, d
