really just want to clear this situation up into something that makes sense to me. So I do the thing that any self-respecting waiter of a phonecall should NOT do - I preempt his call by calling him first. My reasoning: what if he lost my number, like he lost his keys (no quotation marks now)?! His housemate tells me "George is out" which I then analysed to ridiculous lengths - maybe she was on orders to deflect all calls from unexplained girls? Paranoid. Very Paranoid.  Wednesday, 16th June: Bloomsday 2004. Thanks James Joyce for giving me an excuse to call this guy yet again. This time the boy was actually around, though it appears he has to be shouted at several times from the bottom of the stairs - he was playing his drum. He keeps greeting me with "hey man" - is this good? It smacks to me of my own diversionary tactic of refering to someone as "dude". So we discuss Joyce - I alarm him yet again by confessing to have read only the first and eighteenth chapters as a way of economising my time between essay-writing. And some of my paranoia is evaporating away because we're having a genuinely great time. I think by this point it was fair of me to expect him to say something about us - I had already shown my interest by calling him twice. Nothing. I got the impression he was very stressed about exams and was enjoying the break from studying. Not time to broach anything deep and meaningful then. Said something along the lines of "we should catch up in the holidays". Impatient.   He tells me he'll be in the Library on Thursday but, feeling foolish about this whole business, I decided not to turn up in time to catch him there. Bad plan because he was still there when I turned up. I swear I 'm not stalking the guy - though he IS shortsighted and so I very easily could. Worse still I was getting stupidly happy about seeing him there. It being exactly a week since I'd last seen him, I had hoped it would break this accursed effect he was having on me. Also, he was pretty sleep-deprived, stressed and hair unbrushed. Maybe also he was dressing to repel...will nothing turn me off? I try guaging whether his arms are too short - anything to kill the attraction - but it doesn't work. I manage to make him laugh a bit and then he opts for a nap over a coffee with me. Almost blurted out "want some company?".   I'm in real trouble with this guy. We have similar interests but really different personalities - he likes ambiguity and I'm a mess if there's too much of it. According to my astrology-obsessed friend - I must, being a Capricorn with Gemini rising, try to "out-Aquarius him". This sounds stupid enough to work, if I can figure out what it means.
