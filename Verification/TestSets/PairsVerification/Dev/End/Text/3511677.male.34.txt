impossible if you don't.  Cardiologists, I suspect, say the same thing about doing a triple bypass.  So when I called this woman up, and told her what I was told to ask her, she chuckled (knowingly, I hope) and we chatted a bit more, and that was it.  No need to say the obvious -- that it was a dumb question.  I just can't figure out why, when someone (and by someone, I mean my boss) hires someone (and by someone, I mean me) to do a job, that they (the first someone) can't trust the person they hired to do it.  Maybe he's been burned before or something.  In the mean time, I'm getting a little burnt by the micromanagement and lack of trust.  Hope it gets better.  -A-
So now Audrey, whom I'd not heard from for a few days, writes me again this morning.  She says she got herself drunk for the first time in her life.  Which I believe.  Her drink of choice: Gin and Sprite.  Which, surprise surprise surprise, she found kind of nasty.  But she's not drinking for the pleasure.  Or even for the escapism.  Clearly -- to me, anyway -- it's to get attention from her husband.  She did this at home, with him home.  I guess if you've lived your whole life coloring between the lines, something like that is pretty wild.  Then again, she also told me back when we talked, that she got her belly button pierced... purely to do something "wild."  I think in rural Indiana that is shocking.  Here in L.A., of course, that's still flatline conservative.  Then again, in L.A., tongue piercing is just barely weird anymore.  Anyway, 34 years old, first time drinking liquor to excess.  You go, girl.  Except that she didn't say that the guy suddenly came around from whatever idiocy he's in... her cry for help went largely unheeded.  What next?  Smoking?  Poor girl.  Funny thing is, the first line of her email this morning (the first of a half-dozen back and forth throughout the day) was "I don't know how you became my confidante."  Me neither, sweetheart, me neither.  But then again, it's kind of flattering in a twisted way.  I made some progress on the BBQ leftovers today.  I was so enamored of my own cooking that I was positively salivating on the drive home this evening, dreaming of the burgers I was going to grill up.  Yes, plural.  Two big ones.  And I reheated on the grill an ear of corn.... wow, that was even better two days later.  The burgers, besides being stuffed with gorgonzola cheese, I also added grilled (in tin foil, with a little olive oil) Maui onion, more gorgonzola cheese, and a 1/4 avocado.  Did that two times.  And had some potato salad, and later, a cookie.  When do I get to the gym, that's my only question.  Well, can't wait to hear what new misadventures from Indiana tomorrow will bring.  My dear sweet ex, the soap opera fan... well, she's in the middle of one now.  -
