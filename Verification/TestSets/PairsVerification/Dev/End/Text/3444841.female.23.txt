lead to really great conversations and connections with people that I would've judged superficially otherwise.  I like who I am. I'm not matching today--my outfit is the color of the beach--which looks pretty weird in the midst of this concrete haven.  I thank my peeps back home for molding me..you're here, too. kw
Aqui`.  Ah, yes, finally a moment to sit and kind of reflect on these past 48 hours that I've experienced. Life really changed in a matter of an hour and a half. First thing's first. The city: It's hella cool--old architecture, colored people, and style. The city's planned nice and neat so that getting lost is almost impossible. There's so much food and so much to do that I'm kind of overstimulated in a good way. Like the feeling right before you're about to orgasm. There's just SO much of everything. Every culture is trying to stick their fork into this city and claim a piece. I never even see the white collars.. It's like they don't even bother to come this way. There are SOOOO many gay boys, like I told Emily, they seem to be rising from the concrete like steam. Pictures later...as soon as I get to a wireless venue.  The job. Oh man. Intense.

We already have this steady stream of inside jokes going, and they're both so damned witty that it keeps me on my toes. My job consists of driving..more driving..parallel parking, and planning activities. Wednesday I host bingo nights and I've heard that it's a hit. I have a 600$ budget to plan for a month. In september we're totally going to cirque du soleil.  Anyways, I'm doing rather well.. I love and miss you guys, kw
Off Day:    Woke up to the phone ringing. Thankfully it was someone I wanted to talk to...    Felt energized and went for a run. Wished for an iPod b/c my cd player felt oh so heavy.    Almost passed out from the humidity. Felt like I was running weird. Averaged 2.36 min/ lap. Felt pleased considering the state of my lungs.     Ran into a co-worker (The Law), feigned enthusiasm about her weekend wedding. Bolted to the Apt where air conditioning awaited me. Passed out on couch and made it damp and salty. Took off my shirt. Paraded around topless letting the artificial breeze cool my skin. Felt empowered.    Watched my laptop's screensaver. Consumed enough food that would supply me the energy to get to a place where there was more desirable food. Listened to music in my head b/c I was too lazy to turn on the cd player. Thought about showering. Thought about showering more. Stripped and showered. Thought about shaving. Thought against it. Got dressed. Considered cleaning my room, but the urge to escape was stronger. Packed my lap top and headed here. Where smokers are welcomed with ashtrays and coffee..and wireless internet. Sank into a c
