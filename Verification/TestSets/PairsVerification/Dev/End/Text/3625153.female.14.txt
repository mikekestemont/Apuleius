~~>i feel worthless right now. i feel like nothing should mean anything to me. as if were giving meaning to so many small meaningless things and maybe we arent supposed to or maybe we are, i dont know. i read somewhere (well, it wasnt somewhere like i dont remember, i saw it on someones shirt) the other day that the meaning of life is to give life meaning. but everyone is always nagging at other people for having something that means so much to one person but not the other. people tell other people that theyre giving meaning to something meaningless but really its only meaningless to them; that really isnt fair, its like telling someone not to like something just because you dont like it. life is so complicated.. i dont even wanna think about it anymore. we think too much about everything, but i think things would be so much more simple if we didnt think so much.  ~~>i went to my high school today for this stupid fish camp thing. we sat in the auditorium for an hour listening to the representatives from clubs talk and watching the cheerleaders and dance team do their little performances. then we were walking around the school and lauren was running and these stupid bitches were standing there making fun of all the freshman and how lauren was running and it pissed me off!! so when we passed by them i said "bitch" not really right to the girl but loud enough so she could hear me and possibly think i was talking to her. i hope she did realize i was talking to her. nothing would please me more than to go back and kick her ass and call her bad names and make the little skinny blond girl in the tight shirt and the short denim skirt and flip flops fall to her knees and cry and beg for her mommy and for a break from the torture and wrath of me! mwahaha.. is it a coincidence that the notecard im working on right now is for the word superficial? haha..  ~~>anyway.. i think im going to go now, i feel a little better. i want to talk to josh anyway. i feel bad but i still want to talk to him because i love him and also because i dont want him to think that hes done something wrong. ill write again later to tell about fish camp more.. or maybe tomorrow, who knows.. who knows anything a
