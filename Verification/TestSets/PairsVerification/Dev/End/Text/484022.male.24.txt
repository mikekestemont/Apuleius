are gonna overtake us for 2nd place in the AL East.  Someone shoot me now.  Anyway, tomorrow night is karaoke night at the "Grille", and I do believe there will be some songs to sing...I gotta thow down some Lebanese tradition...
This is like the 17th website that I'm supposed to fill with words.  It's brilliant that we're doing it co-op style, especially with this batch of guys, but damn I really need to update those other 16 first...
It has become very apparent to me that I like my dog, like I like taking a crap - I would go without it if I could, but because it is already there, I really appreciate it at times.  Except the times when it comes out messy and without form, which I do not enjoy.  I always thought my dog's name was just a big joke but it turns out that it fits him perfectly.  I look forward to getting an underground fence at my new home and watching my little JackAce learn the fence limits over and over again - maybe it'll be like Electric-Shock Therapy and he'll calm down a bit.  Doubtful.  He's biting me right now . . . I just bit him back.  I'm glad dogs don't have souls, because I would hate to think my dog would be going to hell.  Don't get me wrong though, I love my little JackAce - I just feel there's room to love him more.  I've heard a puppy is good training for a baby.  I hope not.  Hello All.
As I sit here at 11:48 CDT, waiting for the IT resource from ComCEL to showup (he was supposed to be here at 9 a.m.), I can hear 50 Cent wafting up from the street with one twist - it's a French version of "In 'Da Club".  Speaking of music, I'm looking forward to the Phish concert next week.  In northern Vermont, and called "Coventry", it's a four day campout/concert which is the final performance of my favorite band.  I have a feeling it'll be the greatest show I've ever seen. Yes, even better than Billy Joel/Elton John, although I bet Spence and Ace are shaking their heads.   Hope all is well back home....wish I was there....
Back in Haitian country, and still slacking off reading ESPN.com.  Here's an interesting one for you all to ponder:   urlLink http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1851763
Not really sure what to think about the four-way deal that sent Nomar to the Cubs and gave us Cabrera and Mientkiewicz.  Part of me is sad to see the guy go - he's always been a personal favorite.  However, sitting out that game at Yankee stadium a few weeks back, turning down the Sox's offer of a 4 year, $60 million dollar deal, begins to make me doubt his passion and loyalty.   Of course the sting might still have been there after the failed A-Rod deal, but Manny has dealt with it pretty well, and that happened  after  Nomar turned down the original offer, which was pretty generous considering his second half production was pitiful.  Thoughts, a
