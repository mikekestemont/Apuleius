in the workplace, listened to lite-jazz, made me type up extensive handwritten notes about conditions of restrooms that my employer consults about the cleanliness of (!) and made me redo one of the Ugliest Fliers I Have Ever Seen In My Life. none of this is what was described to me. i would say "hey, at least i'm complaining about a job that pays me," but alas, it is not a job that pays me. because i work for twelve hours a week. that barely covers the cost of my damn bus pass. and according to my employer there's room for more hours but not anytime this month. i feel betrayed.      the good news: the library clerk position is still open and they want to interview me tomorrow. everything's not lost.     not that i had plans for memorial day, but it pretty much rained the entire time i was in madison. here is a list of things that were accomplished, as i suspect the fact that i keep putting lists in paragraph form is making your eyes hurt. 1. i drank boxed wine for the first time ever and will no longer joke to Boy about wanting to get it. 2. ate food to the point where i think my family members suspect i have a tapeworm. this always seems to happen when i am at home. 3. reread  urlLink this  for the three bajillionth time.          *informal poll time: all the boys who have read  urlLink that  please raise your hand in the form of leaving a comment. when i was at the bookstore we would keep running tallies of how many men vs. women purchased it and i want to know if i am still right, meaning i determined no man would ever read that ever for fear that he would be summarily parted from his testicles. which is a shame, because it's a damn fine book. and if you are a boy who has not read it, please tell me why. thank you.*    4. met up with my friend from high school for coffee where we discussed capital-e-Everything, making me really glad that i haven't grown completely apart from the people i knew in my younger, dorkier incarnations.  5. tried on high heels with my sister--and i mean really grotesque, awful ones--at boston store. came away from the experience with two pairs of sensible shoes and a secret longing to actually be able to wear shoes that stunt your growth, destroy your feet and make your legs look Really Good. also got called out by aforementioned sister in public for noting that i liked a thong we were looking at. to save face, backtracked and pretended i was joking. felt fourteen years old.      all in all, a good time was had.  and tonight i face the heretofore unhurdled relationship hurdle of going to The Gym with Boy, and even though it is nearly a year now, i still have qualms about him seeing me when my face is the color of a tomato.        soundtrack. replacements,  all shook down        e
