,  where I could pull you closer to my chest ,  To hear my heart beat your name on a constant tempo with no rest , I see that there are no words worthy enough to define what I feel right now , And to be close to you is not good enough , As you’re a seed planted within me , only set to Grow , Creeping through my veins with your thorns and surrounding my heart as you bloom within me , I don’t know what it is about you that gets me this way . But every time I look into your eyes and your smile , so warm and inviting , Something  frozen within me melts , and washes away everything that is wrong with the world as I know it . I can find no fault in my life in the paths  I have taken or the decisions I have made  , I know if my life were to end here and now , I would have reached the pinnacle of happiness ,  Having to have had  spent my life loving you with some kind of deeper truth . I know that even when happiness eludes my heart , and it seems that  God is out there to get me , That I can always borrow your smile with a perfect dream and a glimpse of a better world , In the reflections of your eyes . Shining sapphires , priceless.
It hurts too much to write as I sit here to tell you my life , my mind wants to cry , And fill this page with anger , hate , pain , suffering and everything else that applies , My life is lost , and hate has conquered my soul today , so as you read this , Your reading the words of a deceased , a man deceased out of love , A man whose lost hope , whose died inside through his conquest of love , You are reading the words of man who’s death would not matter , because it already happened once , Yet he still walks and breathes as if to torture what’s left for the years that remain , I am broken as I could never be fixed , I ask you not to pray for me nor to wish me well , Cause nothing could be fixed , At this time I’m surrounded by confusion , Confused by life , confused by reality and illusion , But there’s one thing which brings me so much change , brings my soul to life and reduces the pain , Your words , your love , your care , has mended my heart , has brought me back to life , Has fixed all the shattered pieces of my life , you’ve brought me back , to love once again , I thank you , for where your love has showed me the right way to happiness and joy , and not to pain , Thank you baby b.I love y
