Dear Cecil  Sorry it took me a while since my last blog. Got so busy with those undergraduate thesis and those job at the office. Anyway, i'm still waiting for her to hear my confesion. The wait period is really hell dear... turn my live into completly misery coz i just can't keep this huge feeling to her by my self. But i just can't force her to hear all this coz i affraid it just scare her and at the end she just leave me for good. Sometime i cry when i really... really wanted being with her and miss her really... i just weak man dear.... and can't help deeply falling luv with this girl. I just wish she could... u know.. if she could just hear what is really inside my head... thats all.... i know is not my place now to ask her fo being my lover... though u know how much i want her so bad. Don't know wether i can't bear with this whole situation. I'm really tired dear... i really am....
Dear Cecil... this is my statement  damned!!! i really hate being human with all those complexity emotion that i have to deal with.... am i envy to them who choose not to feel?? can't just push h*r :(( .... bitchy hell!!!!  while the waiting period continue.. i'm starting to loose my sanity here.... phase one is on!!! unless she give her few minute of her time to her what i'm gonna say about what i really felt about her.  Yup Cecil... i'm still waiting for her until this very moment :
