policies, a lot more confident of his style of governance which is very collegiate and people driven. His consultative style is very much a function of that. He has also become a lot more confident about communicating his views in his own way without actually trying to be somebody else."  Taking over from Lee Kuan Yew is a hard act to follow for anyone.  Mr Viswa recalls the years when Mr Goh was still trying to find his own style of governance, "I recall in the initial years of the National Day Rally he tried in the first couple of years I think, he tries using PM Lee's style of using charts at the rally and it didn't quite fit his own personal style so he evolved his own style of communicating. Even the way he communicated at the National Day Rally was completely different from how PM Lee managed the rally. It was a lot more personalised. It was a lot more anecdotal. Even his analogies, people are not quite impressed with his analogies but it was his own brand, his own style. And I think over time, people have come to accept him as Goh Chok Tong the Prime Minister and not see him as Goh Chok Tong the Prime Minister by default."  Dr Tan attributes this change not so much with the need to be popular with the people but to Mr Goh's own personality, "I think basically he has that in him already. It's not that he wants to act it out you see. Because if you act it out, it's different. Because in school you know, he's very caring, he'll join us when we want him to do something, he'll join us, he'll never question. See when i cooked, he washed the pots! See he doesn't complain he just go along with us, and he'll join us, he's very sporting in that sense."  Over the next 14 years, Mr Goh has proved his own mettle as a Prime Minister -- winning over the hearts and minds of Singaporeans.  Even pointed comments in the early years that Mr Goh was a mere seat-warmer for Lee Hsien Loong has long dissipated.   Nominated MP Chandra Mohan Nair echoed the view of many, "If the label seat warmer had been true, by now the seats would have been burnt totally! Definitely he's not a seat warmer. I think he's been with us more than a decade and that surely cannot be labeled as seat warming unless you've got a really warped definition of seat warming. I think he has been given the chance to be prime minister and I think has proven to our country and to this region and the world at large that he's a very capable leader. I think at the end of the day the lesson learnt is that give a guy a chance and probably he will prove that he is capable of doing things."
