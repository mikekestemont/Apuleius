having its yearly MOT and half-yearly service yesterday, and everything went smoothly. The tyres will have to be replaced soon, though and so will the brake pads, but so far it's OK. When we came home the fuel gauge was suddenly below Empty. Did they empty the fuel tank at the garage? Hardly, so it had to be something with the gauge. We went by the garage today, and the mechanic had a quick look at it, came back, looked serious, and told us the sender thing inside the fuel tank had stopped working. He kindly asked us if the car was still on warranty, and when we checked it turned out the warranty expires 3 July 2004. How lucky is that? I found a picture of a Sportage same age and same colour as ours.
OK, now you can post comments without having to make a Blogger account. Let's see how long it takes before I start to get spam comments about medicine and worse things.  June 2004 was the wettest June in Scotland as long as anybody can remember, which is 1953 when they began to write down wetness of months in the UK. Let's hope it's all over now. Tomorrow is the kids' last day at school before the summer holidays, and they want sunshine.  No plans for the summer yet. R is coming to visit us next week, and L is coming early August, but that's all we know. We had plans for France, but it's too expensive. Then Finland. Even worse. UK then.
urlLink   That's German. It means "the creators" or "the doers" or something. And it's the name of a German boardgame about elections and politics. Sofie, Matthias and I are playing it for the second time. Matthias won the last time, and he is already in front having won the regional elections in Bayern. Die Macher is a complicated but brilliant game by Karl-Heinz Schmiel. It takes a while to get into, but it plays beautifully and with long strategies possible. Sofie plays the Green Party, Mats is the Conservatives and I am PDS, the remnants of the old Communist Party in the former DDR.
L, not L who came with S a couple of weeks ago but L, have been staying with us for a week, enjoying the warmest weather yet this year in Scotland. This morning I drove her to the airport at the ungodly hour of 5am. That's the good news, because L has to wait 12 hours in Stanstead before the next plane takes her the rest of the way home to Denmark. L armed herself with the world's biggest packed lunch, fruit, drinking water and free text messages. Send us one when you get home, L! I promised a report from our London-trip, but I am still waiting for some images from down south, so it has to wait a bit more.
We're back in Big E after a splendid, very very warm, week in London. More on that story later. Here it's of course raining and cold compared to London's 27 d
