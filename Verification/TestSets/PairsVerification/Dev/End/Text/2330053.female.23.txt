Imagine your first child is a girl: if i said her name, someone may steal it! just know that it's two names with the initials d.a d. d. 22.

Would you ever consider living abroad? consider it? it's been done.
friday. long weekend. can't muthereffin' wait. this week was a drag. lots to do, lots on my mind. just lots.   yesterday was CANADA DAY & i rocked my canucks jersey @ work. i honest to God was gonna paint a maple leaf on my cheek, but i thought that my yankee coworkers would freak out. whatever. oh & i'm on a hunt for team canada's soccer jersey. anyone have any ideas where i can score one for cheap?   anyhoo hubby & i were gonna go to the san diego county fair (aka del mar fair) yesterday  but instead vouched for dinner & two movies @ the drive in. have i mentioned that that place rocks? it's even better in the titan; all that room. anyhoo, we watched harry potter (not hairy partner, veej) & the prisoner of azkaban & garfield. harry potter plain ROCKED. literally. i don't care if i'm 20 something yrs old, that movie was good & yes, some parts did actually scare me. i'm a chicken sometimes, sue me. anyhoo, shortly after, garfield came on & we originally planned on watching the whole thing, but it got late & i was starting to fall asleep so we headed home after 40 mins. pretty funny movie though.   this weekend seems pretty busy. tomorrow is our Godson's 1st birthday party so we'll be headed up to HELL-EH for that. (hopin' we'll head back sunday night to avoid the crazy traffic on monday). lookin' forward to good grub & "good" alcohol. lol. nice one, p. hopefully i'll be getting my pocketbike beforehand & then after, who knows. as for the 4th of july, dunno just yet. we're pretty much just gonna go with the flow like we always do with everything else. whatever happens happens. i get to bust out my new camera & go ape with it. i'll post those candids as soon as i can (i know i've said that a billion times; sue my ass..i'm busy!).  anyhoo, that's about it for now. to all you yankee's out there, happy fourth of july!
HAPPY CANADA DAY!!!   Have a great & safe Canada Day, all!! I'll be enjoying the homeland's day here in San Diego by rockin' my Canucks Jersey & waiving around the flag. l
