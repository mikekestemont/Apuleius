 Client: "HEY!!! ARE YOU NOT BEING A TEAM PLAYER!!!! DAMN IT!!! WHAT KINDA CONSULTANT ARE YOU!!!"  Any consultant can attest to this as fact, I've worked with so many clients and honestly most places I have worked at have been great, and all do have their sower moments, and great moments...
Remove MSN Messenger 4.7  I find it so annoying that when you install MSN Messenger, Windows Messenger stays in the background.  Run this in the Start-->Run command to get rid of it once and for all.  RunDll32 advpack.dll,LaunchINFSection %windir%\INF\msmsgs.inf,BLC.Remove  Have a great day!
Macintosh - Now that’s Design!  So I've decided to stray a bit from the consulting lifestyle, to take on a more active management related roll in IT.  ImagiNET is a great company and I still recommend them for any Microsoft related issues your organization is facing.  That said in my new roll I have had the chance to play with a Mac G5... WOW! Sometimes I wonder why apple is still around, especially when there is only 1(that’s right, one) Mac consulting company in the city, and no signs of large retailers selling software.  Well, let me tell you.... the Graphics are amazing... these machines are literally built from the ground up with GRAPHICS in mind. Yes there’s PhotoShop for the PC, etc etc... but, PhotoShop for Mac is WICKED! and Quark.. is AMAZING.  Anyway that’s all the time I have... just wanted to put my two cents in on MACS!  I want one now!  And do I need to mention that they make any Personal Computer, even if they have mods on them, look like an old rabbit next to the Viper....  Another tool that I've been fooling around with lately is Poser.  My dad runs a martial arts website: http://www.kyokushincanada.com and I have been waiting for about 6 years now to update the look and feel.  One feature I have decided to add in is flash animations depicting the actual motions made for specific Karate basic techniques. I met a fellow at the new company I work at that used to work for Frantic Films, made some animations on Swordfish and X-men, anyway he’s been showing me around Poser and Max (3D Studio Max).  I used to work with these tools about 6 years ago, and boy have these tools come a long way.  Rendering still seems to take ages, and now some files can reach gigabytes in size during the render process, but man is this stuff fun!  Anyway, with Poser, you can literally take an image (Say I don’t know, lets pick Halley Barry ;) ), place it on points on a 3d model, and with some Magic(Magic being the geek word for a few hours later), you can have your very own cat woman kicking and punching!  Anyway... I'm hoping to start something really neat in the next year or so if I can get really good with Poser and Max... or hire some people that are really good with it at least, Poser/Max/.net... hmmmm what could happen ;) Stay Tuned.  Happy Coding  M
