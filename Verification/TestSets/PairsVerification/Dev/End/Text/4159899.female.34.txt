Live Aware, so you’ll automatically be logged into Live if you have an active account. It’s also good to know that the controls are exactly same as the last game, so no surprises there. The Rainbow Six 3 team of Chavez, Loiselle, Price, and Weber returns along with all of their original weapons and equipment found in the first game, save one change; the .50 cal M82A1 has been replaced with the 7.62mm Dragunov. That’s right, no more .50 cal my little sniping friends. There are still plenty of sniping areas to be found in the game, but it will just take a bit more skill now that the .50 cal has been axed.        Single Player   I know more people that own Rainbow Six 3 and have never played its single-player game modes than any other Xbox title out there. True, playing individually cannot replace the intensity of a heated Team Survival match, but the campaign mode was still as steady as any other Xbox FPS on the market. The AI of your teammates and enemies were a little shoddy at times, but you could still brush up on your skills before going online and enjoy a fairly decent storyline along the way. Black Arrow’s campaign mode contains 10 new levels that are a good mix of indoor and outdoor settings. You can tell that quite a bit of time has been spent in the level design to ensure that they play well in the single player game modes as well as online. Stats are now kept not only for multiplayer modes, but the single player modes as well. When at the briefing screen a new option of “Hi-Score” is available that will allow you to view statistics for the Campaign, Practice Mission, Terrorist Hunt, and Lone Rush game modes. So if you thought you were so money at Terrorist Hunt in the last game, you’ll now be able to check your skills versus the rest of the world on  Obviously all the single-player modes from the last game return, but the addition of Lone Rush gives the game a little more gusto. Lone Rush is a single-player game only, so no teammates here for assistance. The object is to make it to the finish line before the timer of one minute and thirty seconds expires. With the scope of these maps, it’s pretty obvious there is no way to get from Point A to Point B (alive) in 1:30. Luckily bonus time is awarded for every terrorist killed, hostage saved, or bomb disarmed. There are plenty of bad guys spread throughout the level that put up a stiff challenge even for the most seasoned RS3 player. Lone Rush tends to be quite addictive as far as a single-player game mode go and really helps to strengthen your twitch reactions for  being that the action is fast and furious. Any method that gives you an edge on the ins and outs of a map will prove to be extremely valuable online
