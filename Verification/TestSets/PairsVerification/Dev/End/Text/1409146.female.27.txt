I decided to leave things alone and send them back to their own place (there was a problem with how this was going to perspire, but details, details).  I woke up to a gloomy sky.    I will probably always thing about Gav because he was a great read, but he’s long gone.  It’s futile to think of what could have been.    I’m trying to convince myself that I will be fine without Marcus as well.  It’s hard, but I can’t stop the inevitable.  He was the best first I could have asked for.
It’s incredulous that I used feel apathetic towards the Cure.  Any fan must be a romantic at heart.  Lyrics aren’t my thing, but you can’t help but catch a few.  His voices bleeds with sorrow and pain.  Damn.    On another note, I had the most troubling dream last night.  I was looking for something with a friend of mine.  We’d been drinking gin and tonics and smoking some cloves.  He opened the patio door.  The deck led out onto a grassy knoll.  The house was a mansion and there was a party going on, but we were hanging out at a sparsely populated section of the house.  We decided to venture out into the yard, and we did the nasty.  The next morning, I lost all recollection of this event, but my friend looked at me oddly.  He tried to give me a comforting pat and said that we were still friends.  I remember continuing my quest for whatever it was I was looking for, but everywhere I went, people were snickering or giving me these odd looks.  His ex girlfriend (but in my dream they were still together) coldly ignored me.  Her friend informed me of the enormous resentment she held for me.  I couldn’t understand it.  Finally, I went to see my friend Leo.  He told me that I was a naughty girl and that he didn’t know I had it in me.  Shocking!  He said everyone had been talking.  I denied any knowledge, but tried to dig through the files of my memory to get a better idea.  All the sudden it came to me in flashes all that had gone down on the lawn.  Evidently, I put on quite a show.  I was mortified.  I knew Marcus would be so angry with me.  I couldn’t believe that the second guy I slept with would be this friend. Lucky me it was just a dream.    I think I had this dream b/c I lied to Marcus.  A little lie that I forgot about until I gave it more thought.  I had a drag of a cig on Friday night.  It was a little one, but I was drunk when I smoked it.  The next day he asked me if I smoked, and I said no of course not.  However, a couple of minutes later when I went to take my shower, I was going through the previous nights events, and I remember some guy gave me a drag.  Oops…  I’m going to L.A. this Friday.  Y
