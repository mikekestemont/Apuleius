each time i leave my unhappiness before you, with the mentality that you are obliged to turn them into joy. I ask that you Lord, give me the faith i need to serve you in everyway i can, and that i will see you Jesus, in every person whom i know. Amen."
Today was a new experience for me, and a very memorable one indeed. I've always known that my singing wasn't that great, and that I've always lacked the enthusiasm and intensity, but well, i just love singing, and that was why i actually decided to get a group of ppl who were as enthu about it as me to sing for our birthday girl.  Initially the plan was for me to duet with Angela, on a Whole New World. It was the initial idea until the Wednesday before, when i realised i couldn't get a pianist to accompany it. That very day, i phoned Jonathan to ask him, "um...do you think you could learn a piano piece in just 4 days?" and he was like, "What!? you kidding?" But somehow i had still convinced him to try. On saturday, Jon and Angie came over to my place to see if it was possible to piece the song together, and guess what, after the whole thing it was still in pieces. I had to become the pianist at the last minute, and Jon was left to struggle with Aladdin's tenor part. Later, Jonathan remembered he had so coincidentally been playing a Chinese song that was perfect for Alethea. And since i was her Chinese student, it was even more appropriate that i should sing to her in Chinese! The song (If i understand the words correctly), is about a person who's looking back in life, and expressing how meaningful her Grandmother's words were as projected in her daily life. Later, Daniel and Brennan joined in, and they had the perfect chance to learn Stay The Same, at the last minute, in fact, the last hour, an hour before we left for Alethea's place on Sunday. The experience of singing for someone just to show how much you appreciate the person can be really frightening. Basically, the fear is that you'll screw up (which i did), and that it will degrade the sincerity of the whole thing. I felt that somehow, if it wasn't perfect, it would be more of an insult rather than a strong sign of appreciation. I don't know if the rest felt the same way, but i know that Jonathan was desperately trying to relieve the tension by shaking it out, while Angela looked so calm it was frightening. Well, i'm glad that Alethea appreciated our effort a lot, and that she didn't mind us not doing a perfect job.I still however, would have liked it to be perfect. As what i was later told, maybe i am a perfectionist. Perhaps what this experience has taught me is that "you can do so much without doing it right, but yet with the right heart, itself is already p
