or family again?  Answer #1: No.  I would never live in another country.  Don't think I would ever 'deeply love' a person who supported living in another country, especially with 'little chance of seeing friends or family again.'  And love is no reason to make such a rash decision, anyhow.
Wow, how easy it is to forget these sort of things.  It is now July.  Besides August, quite possibly the best month of the year.  August being best, of course, for its great weather, and my birthday....which, by the way, this year, will be my GOLDEN birthday.  26 years old on the 26th.  Only happens once in a lifetime.  But it's not August yet.  It's July.  Also a great month because of the warm weather, sunshine, and the greatest (well....it's kinda a tie with Thanksgiving) holiday ever....July 4th.  Everyone America over celebrates what it means to live in our great country....we get together with friends, family, neighbors, church members....we wear red, white, & blue....charcoal or propane, we grill all weekend long....we cry when we sing The Star Spangled Banner....we listen to real American music like Willie, Steve Miller Band, & Jimmy Buffet....and we praise God for blessing us with a life in the greatest place on earth.  Gotta love the Fourth.  We're all headed to my brother, Billy's, house for Saturday.  He's got one of those big smoker/pit type things that he claims can fit an entire cow on.  Who knows.  I'm just looking forward to some of his great brisket.  Think he's starting at 3:00am, and planning to serve at 2:00pm.  Should be fun.  Question #6: You discover your wonderful one-year-old child is, because of a mixup at the hospital, not yours.  Would you want to exchange the child to try to correct the mistake? Answer #6: Dear Lord, yes!  Of course I would want to exchange.  Geez, once I found out it was not really mine, I would not want a child who had some medical history I was unaware of.  What if he/she had a big, fat mom who ate nothing but Twinkies and fried chicken while pregnant?  That's just asking for a fat & retarded kid....but you may not know that nor see the consequences till the poor kid is a couple years old.  No freakin' way I would want to raise a kid that who knows how his/her mom acted while pregnant.  Every damn thing makes a difference.  Did she inhale toxic chemicals just because she wanted to get her toenails painted?  Did she eat/drink refined sugar?  Did she get enough sleep?  Did she inhale smoke from a candle she thought was cute, or perhaps because she just didn't have the nerve to ask for a better seat at a restaurant?  Was she happy when she was pregnant?  Does she have a good relationship with her husband?  Did she want this child?  And the list goes on.  There are just too many ways a person can screw up that I would not trust a soul to make a baby good enough for me.  Give me my o
