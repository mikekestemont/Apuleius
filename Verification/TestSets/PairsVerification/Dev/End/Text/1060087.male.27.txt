 And I also wonder if somehow, my heightened ability to  understand broken English and body language will help me to communicate with  more people than if I were fluent in Korean...since I can&nbsp;understand all  broken English...not just Korean broken English...it could just go a long way.
I got into the elevator at work yesterday...thinking to myself...and I had a conversation (in my head) with the woman in the elevator.  And I was thinking how I would feel if I told her, "Good morning," and she responded, "What's so good about it?" So I just thought to myself, Well, for one thing I'm still alive. And we can walk around outside and not worry too much about getting shot on the street. And we're lucky to not be starving. To have clothing and shoes that don't have holes in them.  The thought of shoes with holes...reminded me of my mom.  I don't know if she ever told me a story about shoes with holes...but I do imagine she did.  That's one good thing about technology and globalization.  We can appreciate how lucky and blessed we really are in this country...and even within our country.  Of course, we usually don't...and well, I guess that's only human.
I got a free can of soda from the vending machine today. Sweet! (Get it?! Soda? Sweet!)  That makes today an especially fortunate day. Maybe I should play the lotto.
You know you're socially inept when:   1. Someone makes a comment and you know you could come back with a witty response, but all you can think is, I should say something...something....  Instead you laugh.  This occurs regularly.   2. When trying to explain something, you can never manage to finish a complete sentence.  "Well it's like...I mean...that is...but then...I uh...oh...uh...."  This happens even when speaking to people you don't have a crush on.   3. People never sit down to talk to you during your lunch break. Or people sit down around you and talk to everyone else besides you during your lunch break.   4. The most people ever comment about your clothing is that they are colorful.   5. When you finally think of something to say in a group, you effectively bring the conversation to a halt with the fewest words possible.  This is why people don't talk to you.   6. After you tell a joke, no one ever laughs.  Or people laugh, but are actually laughing at you.   7. People scare you.   8. All the people you seem to click with share these traits with you.   9. When in a social situation, you often lose track of what you are doing and what you were talking about.    I can't remember if I had a point.
You know you're hungry when the first thing you think about when you wake up is dinner. I think I'll have fried chicken for lunch. Maybe something involving beef for dinner. Or fish. Or chips. Or pancakes. Or waffles.  Right now, I'm stuck eating a granola bar.
Interesting...chewing Polar Ice flavored Eclipse and drinking Hazelnut coffee (light and sweet) tastes like...a tacos shell...a hard taco s
