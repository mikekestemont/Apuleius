as soon as we saw each other, excited to see me.  We spend most of the day together, and he invites me to his house that evening for a St. Patty’s day party.  I couldn’t go, and I think he may have thought I was blowing him off.  My best friend had just had a baby the day before and I was going to visit her that evening.  The hospital that she was at was about two and a half hours from where he lived, so I really couldn’t make it.  Still, that was when things sort of died with us.  I started seeing another guy (he was still seeing other people also), which is a whole other story (the wound is healed, but the scar is still fresh), and “we” just didn’t happen.  I don’t really remember what got us talking again, but a month or so ago he asked me to his house, for a poker game with him and his friends.  Now, to me, this was a big date—I was meeting the friends.  They all liked me and “approved” as you might say.  Even his friends could see that he wasn’t making any moves toward me though and they called him on it, trying to do it in a way so that I wouldn’t know what was happening.  Try as they might, they were still completely transparent.   Jump to the end of the night—a long, goodnight hug.  I like chivalry and guys being old-fashioned and all, but eventually you have to give a girl some sign about whether things are going anywhere.   And since then, I have talked to him quite a bit, but not another date.  I do know that he is coming to my house for a party that I am having next month, so I know we will be seeing each other again soon.  But, it would be nice, if he is interested, to have a date a little more often than every two or three months.    Now, I would like to point out that my waiting around for months is not out of desperation.  And I guess I didn’t really wait all that time—I did have the David fiasco (to be explained later).  I really see some potential with this guy.  We never lack for conversation, have a great time when we are together—the chemistry is great.  I know I should just make a move and see what happens, but like I said earlier, I am a chicken.  That is my number one reason for still being single; I let my chances pass by because I am too afraid to make the first move.  The first step is to identify the problem, the next, to conquer it.  That is what I am working on now.  I have started in that direction by inviting him not only to this weekend’s get together, but also the one in a few weeks.  So, we will see what happens!  Please leave comments!  I love to read what others have to say about the situations I get myself i
