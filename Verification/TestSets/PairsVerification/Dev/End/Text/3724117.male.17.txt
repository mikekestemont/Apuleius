automatic. i didn't have a good feeling about this. lo and behold. at around 8:15, along C-5, the U-turn slot going to greenmeadows...  *bam*.  nabangga ako. galing noh? anyway... the car i hit was medyo bulok, and the bumper kinda... you know... fell-off. good thing he only asked for minimal charges-- 500 bucks to be exact; padadala nya na lang daw sa  latero . and the damage to my car... erm... let's not talk about that.  i kinda didn't have gana na to go to school... well, i attended my first class, Math 17, and i got there just on time. di ako na-late. then after that... i decided to cut the rest of the day... since i wasn't able to tell my parents yet. i just stayed with sila nix and gabby in the condo and ate lunch in bentobox.  went home na after that... watched "you got served". medyo walang kwentang movie. and now im sleepy. later dayz... zzzzzzzz.....  oh, last thing. karen still doesn't know.   greetings to samara cruz! Happy Birthday!!!! :)
haha.  we had a meeting today for dandan's despedida on the 17th. it's cool that people are actually working hard for this party. we were able to decide on the food, the program, the invitations, etc. but we're still having a problem where to get the funds to sustain this event into a fun one.   on my way to the meeting, i had nothing to think of. haha. except for the fact that i was able to create a name for this committee--  D-doc .  Stands for Dandan Despedida Organizing Committee . hahahahaha!!!!!!!! weird. anyway... we're doing our best!!! it's pretty hard. napikon pa si nix sa kin coz i wouldn't want him to help... labo niya kasi minsan eh!    oh yeah .  had lunch with krizelle. it was so awkward. i almost wished di kami natuloy. it was simply bad. she's changed now. she's just too different... i was even calling her  bitch  for her bitchy attitude. i kinda didn't wanna talk much. so there.
whoopee. it's the first of july. almost a month since i first tasted the college life. and almost 2 days since i posted my last thoughts. i realized-- yeah. nakakatamad. so i know what to do now, i'll post whenever i feel like posting. i won't force it on myself to post everyday.  quite impossible din naman.  so... hmm. highschool sucks-- well at least southridge and woodrose do! 2 consecutive days of no classes?! sussss.... e kami nga bumabagyo na may pasok pa! all the more,  may test pa .  i thought i didn't do well in that stupid math test... heck, i think i'm one of the highest. yabaaaaang... hehe. basta i'm quite happy i answered everything almost correctly... just not sure with the true or false. *gulp* but anyhooo.... erm. i think that's just about it.  tamad e.   besides, i've got nothing to say anyway! yey. friday tomorrow. lapit na july 27...
