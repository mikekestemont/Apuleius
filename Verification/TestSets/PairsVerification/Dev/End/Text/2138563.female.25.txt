which is a charactaristic i don't particulary like to have.&nbsp; i am always&nbsp;telling people to&nbsp;speak your mind, no matter what.&nbsp; &nbsp;quit wasting everyone's time and just say what you feel.&nbsp; it's a lot harder, but it's so much better that way.&nbsp; you are being up front and honest, no games.&nbsp; it takes a lot of guts to be honest these days and in the end you are respected for it.&nbsp;   well, this entry is going nowhere else but down so i guess i'll cut myself off.&nbsp; how about this beautiful weather?&nbsp; it's been low to mid 80's all week long and in the 60's every morning when i leave for work.&nbsp; and it's the end of july!&nbsp; such an awesome treat!&nbsp;   now i'm off to find balance and inner strength in my yoga class!&nbsp; namaste.
this was me in high school according to a quiz i took on the web.&nbsp; it is a pretty accurate description of the way i was:    urlLink    Take the  urlLink What High SchoolStereotype Are You?  quiz.   everyone should go check it out.&nbsp; it's funny.&nbsp; thankfully i made it out alive&nbsp;and&nbsp;am now on a fast-track to hell.&nbsp; i know, i know, i guess that's not funny to some people.&nbsp; well, got some work to do and then to the dentist.&nbsp; will have something new to whine about tomorrow b/c i'm sure my dentist will have very bad news for me.&nbsp; i am keeping my fingers crossed for the best though.&nbsp; peace is having happy teeth.
well, i am still alive.  bet you were wondering.  here's a quick rundown of my life since last wednesday:  got bit by a fire ant and my foot swelled up really big (some sort of allergic reaction), got stood up for my date (the show was cancelled but he didn't bother to call and let me know), my other job sucked b/c people were just plain crazy this weekend (apparantly it was a blue moon:  two full moons in one month), i watched the entire lord of the rings trilogy on sunday (i know, i'm a nerd), i have gnats in my house and can't get rid of them (i've tried everything i can think of, so i'm going to fred's to get some fly paper), i think i caught a nasty cold, got a nail in my tire & it went flat and i bought a brand new totally awesome sleeping bag.  so i've been real busy at work and haven't had time to write, but i promise i'll get another chance eventually.  i'm about to go home and nurse myself back to health before i get a chance to get very sick.  i'm going to turn down the a/c (because it's hotter than a skeeter in a bug zapper down here in arkansas), work on my bro's tattoo, bake some zucchini, drink some echinachea tea with lemon, take some vitamin C and veg on some tv.  hopefully i will be cured of this terrible cold in a few days.  i'm actually aiming to fix it before it gets worse.  well, peace e
