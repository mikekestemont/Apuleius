I don't mean magic. Bruce learnt he could make a difference without the powers and later on Anthony spotted some chavs letting down tyres across the road, so I did something.  Nothing big or special, just went over and as I crossed the road they did in the other direction so I followed back and confronted them.   Are you two letting down tyres?   No   Are you sure?   Yes honest.   Are you sure?   Yes, We weren't I promise!   Right   And I left... and they walked off but didn't do it again. Liek I said nothing big but it felt good. Neighbourhood watch here I come :) It's easy not to do things like that and I think I've realised I don't do things I should. That's gonna change.
urlLink Shaun Inmans  rather spiffy  urlLink shortstats  has always looked nice to me but until lately I coudln't run it as I don't use MySQL. So I hacked it and with Shaun's permission here is a guide how.   configuration.php  One small change ass  $SI_db['con'] = 0;  to the database section to provide a connection resource for all your PostgreSQL actions.  _install.php     Change the checking line to use  $SI_db['con']  and  pg_query  so the code reads   if (@ pg_query($SI_db['con'],"SELECT * FROM $SI_tables[stats]") && @ pg_query($SI_db['con'],"SELECT * FROM $SI_tables[searchterms]"))    Change the two queries that add the database to the following   $query = "CREATE TABLE ".$SI_tables['stats']." ( 	  id SERIAL, 	  remote_ip varchar(15) NOT NULL, 	  country varchar(50) NOT NULL, 	  domain varchar(255) NOT NULL, 	  referer varchar(255) NOT NULL, 	  resource varchar(255) NOT NULL, 	  user_agent varchar(255) NOT NULL, 	  platform varchar(50) NOT NULL, 	  browser varchar(50) NOT NULL, 	  version varchar(15) NOT NULL, 	  dt int4 NOT NULL default '0', 	  PRIMARY KEY (\"id\") 	  )"; $query_search = "CREATE TABLE $SI_tables[searchterms] ( 	  id SERIAL, 	  searchterms varchar(255) NOT NULL, 	  count int4 NOT NULL default '0', 	  PRIMARY KEY  (id) 	  )";       Take the query execution out of the if statment at the end as so:   	$r1 = @ pg_query($SI_db['con'],$query); 	$r2 = @ pg_query($SI_db['con'],$query_search); 	 	if ($r1 && $r2)        inc.stats.php  One small change, the query at the end should be  pg_query($SI_db['con'],$query);  using our database connection and PostgreSQL.  functions.php  Again three changes here    The connection function  SI_pconnect()  needs a PostreSQL connection string like  $SI_db['con'] =@ pg_connect("host=".$SI_db['server']." user=".$SI_db['username']." password=".$SI_db['password']." dbname=".$SI_db['database']);  and you can replace the logic after with  if ($SI_db['con'] = 0)	die($horribly);     Every single function needs to be scoured for  mysql_query($query);  calls and have them replaced with  pg_query($SI_db['con'],$query);  as well as adding  global $SI_db;  at the start of every single function.   last but not least a to get referers working we need a small change to the SQL in  SI_getDomains()    SELECT      domain,      referer,      COUNT(*) AS total,     MAX(dt) as last_access   FROM      $SI_tables[stats]   WHERE      domain !='".     SI_trimReferer($_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'])."'    AND      domain!=''    GROUP BY      domain,referer   ORDER BY      total DESC,      last_access DESC        And then your done  Follow the README provided and everything should work fine. If not feel free to email me and if I have time I'll offer help or even send a copy of my working abeit  urlLink old version of s
