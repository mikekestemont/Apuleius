day, the sun's retiration allows you to regain control or as much of it as you wish.      although i'm not quite certain where i was going with that post, i do know that it's 8:07 a.m. eastern time, and i still do wish to be back home. in kansas, where the sunrises are colorful and the stars glitter and glissen on black velvet. massachusetts has neither. the night's physicality is black, inturrupted by the glare of a streetlamp and the loud montony of street dances and entertainment. the morning air isn't pure, for it is rocked by the vibrations of dump trucks and lawn mowers (in my locale).
i've been too generous with error's that i've made. i feel regretful, though i shouldn't. i've sliced away a big chunk of burden which should have been dealt with some time ago. eh, although i'm not sure if it was the right thing to do...      i need to find some humor or some wonderfully enchanting asset.   funny people allow for smiles  and i would like that ability: to make people be greatful for being alive. however, i suppose the first key to this is meeting that goal myself. being a teenager tastes worse than sardines smell, yet at the same time, it's rather exhilirating. knowing that 15 years from now, my world will be different is a comforting thought. but i don't know if i want it to change. perhaps i'll come to cherish the blunders i've made as an intricate part of adolescense. after all, how can one learn if one doesn't err.       embarressment is another factor though. it is agreeable that we all could do away with that squeemish feeling recieved upon compeleting a daunting task with minimal avail. for instance, if you've written something you find truely brilliant, then you take it to class and hear 15 of your peers claim it was junk, that's embaressing. (eh, forgot where i was going with that point)      in any event, i am looking forward- God forbid- to senior year. should be fun, seeing as my association with my soon to be former classmates will be little. although, i do regret this, which i can't believe i've admitted...nonetheless, i hope that the final year of high school turns out brilliantly for all.       looking back on memories of grades past, i can't recall a specific level of education which i found extraneously preposterous either academically or socially other than frosh year. the memories are humourous on the outside, and cease to plague me on the inside. especially that of gym class. although it drove me nutso on the inside knowing that i simply wasn't picked for teams, the image of a 14 year old girl sitting in the middle of the gymnasium while the other students departed for teams. i was like a fish caught in the divide of the sea. no pity, just laughter now.       now that i've likely bored somebody, i'll retreat until tomorrow. i think perhaps i'm going to abandon my livejournal and revert to this blog thing. it's much more f
