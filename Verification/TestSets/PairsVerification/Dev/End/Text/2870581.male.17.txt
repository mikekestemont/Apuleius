for the skinny ass Ben. Yeah $30 bucks gone too. Dammit. But I don't care, I have another yardsale! And we are having it at Katie's house. And it should be great!
So the yardsale went really well. I got $150 from it. And it was fun. Yesterday I went out and bought the Donnie Darko DVD with the money I got from washing the car. The "Fo_us". And today I am just really bored. Which just do happens to be the biggest chiche ever in my life. And we didn't go to the lake, and it's thundering, I guess God is also celebrating the American's independence from the British over 200 years ago.

urlLink    So my aunt just bought a brand new Volvo XC90 to replace her S60. And it's great. I mean turbo-powered and safe as any other SUV made. I got the chance to drive it and I must admit, Volga, you ain't got shit on this beast. 0-60 in 5 seconds I think, as I did take it out on the highway to get a good listen to the turbo. In-dash 6-CD changer, sunroof, dual air controls and for back seat. She decided to not get the 3rd seat because she got the Pet Package with the kennel separator. I mean it's great.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    OMG My aunts new freaking 2004 Volvo XC90! So awesome. Not like the S60 was bad or anything but an upgrade is an upgrade. These were taken tonight and I even got to drive it! Turbo charged and ready to go, drives and feels like a car, but its big roomy, and awesome on gas mileage. Hardly any emmisions AND the radiatior cleans the air as it drives eating all the nasty air from the piece-of-shit-cars. Well I could sit here and say all the benefits of the Volvo XC90, but then again you could visit the website at VOLVOXC90.com&nbsp; urlLink
Hey everyone. Sorry on my lack of posting but things have been crazy around here. With me getting a job and everything, haven't had time to do anything. So yesterday my friends (Mary, Karyn, Katie and her boyfriend Matt) all went to go shopping for tax-free weekend. We shopped and stuff. I bought a Taking Back Sunday and Interpol shirt. Along with a pair of corduroys. Concord Mills was fun. Then we went hiking, and it was awesome. We all had a blast at Crowder's (Croucher's) Mountain. We decided to go eat at IHOP. My car boiled over, and we went to Wal-Mart go get corks and coolant. Volga was fixed and we had a great time. Yesterday was one of the best days I have ever lived. (It's up there with Denver and such) I drew a sketc from the top of the mountain. Karyn drew her hand and a c
