fucking trust.. why? WHY would u do that? It wouldnt ever work.. I love her like my own family.. & I dont like you at all. My personality is the opposite of most peoples.. And sometimes I come out all wrong. But fuck it all. For once I want to go a day where I can let everything go.. all the shit thats happened &amp; everything in my past.. & my worries about my mom GO.. just 24 hours. Thats it. It will never happen. I have too much to let go of.. too many memories that I can never forget.. Its too much to even type out on this thing.. &amp; whoever is reading it.. pry dosnt care anyways.    Why do I get like this? In these depression moods.. I dont get it.. I guess its just who I am. I cant really control it. And some people think I am feeling sorry for myself.. WELL THEY CAN GO FUCK MY ASS (reeses words) because if they are reading this.. I hate you. I wish you knew the first thing about me.. then you'd know all this shit and wouldnt have to be reading a BLOG to find out about my past. HAHA. ~ASHLY~
Why Why Why does it always seem like my life is falling apart?   As soon as one thing gets better, something even worse comes along and FUCKING WRECKS MY LIFE. I hate hate hate everything thats going on. I love my mom, until a few days ago.. I considered her a best friend of mine, shes so cool.. &amp; treats me like an actual human instead of a baby like my grandma. I love my mother, so please let her stay with me. I wish i could have a normal family just for a few days to see what its like. I dont have a dad, and in a few months, years.. decades.. whatever I wont have a mom either. I can only wish. Dream on Ashly. Nothing that great could happen to u. If I lose my mom, I will go into a deep depression and that will be it, no way I can live my life without her. Everything FUCKING SUCKS NOW! Unbelievable that someones life can change in one minute.    ASHLY
Dear Mother-   It really sucks that all this has to happen to you. I love you so much & I always will no matter what. I wish that everything imaginable that sucks in life didnt have to happen to my family. I wish I could see you more too.. But now... thats just not a option is it? I hope that everything will be okay for you, I'll always be there to help you when everything starts happening to you. I hate to think about my future without you. Getting married with no mom to help me, College without you to talk to, just my life in general without one of my best friends. I cant deal with death &amp; I hope I never have to. I love you no matter what. Love, A
