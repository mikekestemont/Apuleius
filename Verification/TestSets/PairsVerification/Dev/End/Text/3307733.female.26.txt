of everything.   Anyhow, nasty things said by both sides.   I decided to have no further contact with him last week. Ever. Maybe when I'm older that will change. But for now, he and I are both too stubborn to apologize. He hasn't been a father to me for years and I can't say that anything much has changed. Only the reality that he's the man I had always heard about and had always hoped everyone was wrong about. I still can't believe he acted in the way he did.   He attacked my aunt as well. My closest friend and ally in the family. Apparently he thinks I've been poisoned against him. The two of them have had a fairly long standing feud. He said to me that family is the most important thing to him. When his parents are pissed at him, his sisters will no longer speak to him and he attacks his only biological child.   I've never seen a father act in this way toward a child.   Now, all of this is my perception. A one-sided arguement, I guess. I will not post e-mails here because they are simply too much to handle at this point. I want to sweep it all under the rug and forget about it. I haven't needed him for years and will continue to get along without him. It's the finality of the decision. I had always hoped he and I could be close. Apparently that's not going to be the case.   Could I have done something different? Probably. But I'm not the parent here. I'm his daughter. I shouldn't have to clamor for the approval of an apparition. If he had wanted a relationship with me for the last few years, if he could have seen past whatever anger he held toward me, if things could have been worked out enough in his head to have a conversation with me....then maybe the situation would have been different.   I have an ex stepfather whom I have called "dad" since I was fairly young. He's the one who was there and continues to be. I have a stepfather now who would take care of me if push came to shove. I have a great family with lots of loving support. It took me until last week to realize what a support network I have. Randy (the bio father) seems to be the only one who doesn't want to be a part of it. He wants to get to know his grandson, that's evident. But he will not get to know my son until he gets to know me.   I've already checked out the legal issues governing grandparental rights and have found out that he doesn't have any rights. He hasn't seen Erik, hasn't contacted him and it's not like he's been seeing him since he was an infant. So, that's that. If they want to take it to court, then so be it. I wouldn't put it past them.   Anyhow, that has been the main part of my week.   Happy Fourth of July to m
