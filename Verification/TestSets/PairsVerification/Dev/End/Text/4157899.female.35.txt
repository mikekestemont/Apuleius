sound weird to some but my husband and I send IM's to each other all the time, and we are in the same room!   We can send links back and forth, talk about the kids without them hearing, and just send an "I love you". Okay, so you might think we don't talk anymore, but I can tell you, Eric is happy for the quiet once in a while. I can talk like nobody's business.  I am waiting for my mother in law to get IM, we need to get her DSL first. I tell Eric that she would LOVE it. She will be able to keep in touch with everyone, especially the kids. Now, we are a Mac family, so I can easily voice or video chat. I can also send photos over my IM with ease.  I mean, wow!  Well, Krystal is trying to figure out where she wants to eat for her birthday dinner (what is it a special day or something?) she has changed her mind at least eight times already. We will watch the LA Galaxy on tv and then head to dinner, because frankly nothing comes before the Galaxy.
We are waiting! Six days ago we put in a bid for ocean view property in Baja and still we wait. This is our dream. We NEED this property. It is where we will spend endless days on the beach, hosting parties, relaxing, and our retirement. Great, have I jinxed it now, does this mean they will say no? More money, okay okay okay, anything! Of course Eric and I kick ourselves for not getting in years ago when we first thought of it and it was MUCH cheaper. Well, hindsight right? So, we wait. Everyday we hope for an e-mail, a phone call, something. Nada! I feel as though life is on hold. Not quite as bad as when we bought our home, but close. Well, I am going to go wait some more. Wish us luck!
Sometimes I feel as if I am going to go out of my head being at home with four kids. I count the hours until my husband is home, an adult, someone to help spread the madness. How can they be so dang cute and so annoying all at the same time? So, as I think, wow I need to run away, I think a I only have 55 days until I go back to work. Yikes! I love my job, don't get me wrong, I love my kids too. But too much of a good thing..... I try and remember that I probably (although I don't see how) get on their nerves as well. If we decide to go to the park, everyone is excited. If we go to the dog beach, woo hoo. If we go shopping, all right! But somewhere between the going and the being there, the outing loses some of its appeal and someone is complaining. So, easy enough to fix, hey you don't like it stay home and do chores. Ha!
