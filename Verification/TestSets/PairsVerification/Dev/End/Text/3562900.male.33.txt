could have done without.  Thank you blogspot for letting me vent.  I'll be off the next 2 days so I think I can get over it.  Goodnight!
I'm hoping this is not going to be my only post for July.&nbsp; It's been a busy month, though.&nbsp; So I apologize to all my non-readers that I haven't been updating.&nbsp; I think I'm about settled in to our new place.&nbsp; Doing errands and commuting to work from here has finalized the moving process.&nbsp; I think all the address changes are complete and&nbsp;that should be&nbsp;it.&nbsp; It feels so good to go home at night and just chill.&nbsp; Even if it's just playing Madden on easy mode.&nbsp; ha! ha!&nbsp; All the gamers know what I'm talking about.&nbsp; Imagine Raiders 84, Broncos 7.&nbsp; I still have some closets to rearrange and I think more garbage to toss.&nbsp; Anyone interested in a 20 gal plexi?&nbsp; How about a 7 with pump and lighting?&nbsp; I really want to set up the tanks again, but the place looks so good with very few furnishings.&nbsp; "It's contemporary" as my love would say.&nbsp; When we lived there before, we cluttered the place up.&nbsp; I guess we spent too much time here.&nbsp; Every inch of space had to be filled- even the ceilings(right, hon?!).&nbsp; That was halarious.&nbsp; My love just had to do some interior decorating in our grand family room- so she...&nbsp;&nbsp;    put fabric all around the room- draping from the ceiling.&nbsp;    It was brown.&nbsp;    The futon was brown.&nbsp;    The carpet was brown.&nbsp;    Damn it!, we're brown!&nbsp;    Well, at least I am!&nbsp;    When I'm sitting in the livingroom I feel like I'm immensed in shit!&nbsp;    But it's home.&nbsp; And we're back again and I love it more than ever now.&nbsp; From being away, I've realized how lucky we are to have such a beautiful home.&nbsp; We are truly fortunate.&nbsp; As Prince would say, "I'm yucky!"&nbsp; ha, ha, very funny.&nbsp;
Although I am an hourly employee here at my new job, I'm treated better here than my previous one.  The stress level is lower, my peers are actually working and not gossiping among other managers, and jobs are not being threatened continuously.  My peers talk to me, rather than being talked down to.  I was talking to my manager yesterday about occupancy and availability.  We talked.  If it were the other job, I would be either blown off or simply cut off and told to go somewhere.  Now to think of it- that was very rude!  A lot of the managers that I worked with or under were rude.  I really like the place I work at now.  The managers treat their employees well and that must be a reflection of their bosses, corporate.  I didn't know corporate could be so reasonable.  What have I been missing out on?  Now I work my 8 hours and I get to relax when I'm not working.  My time is my time.  What a value!  or is that almost a human right?  By the way, Spiderman 2 is tight!  I can't wait to get the video g
