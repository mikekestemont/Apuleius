preemptive strikes.  If we did, we would live in a "Minority Report" inspired landscape where people who were prone to commit crimes would be locked up.  Don't we believe in innocent until proven guilty?  So, how can we say that we are fighting for the American way?    Ahhhh.  I am tired.  There is more.  There is always more.  I didn't even get to the part about Bush and Israel or about education.  I was watching  urlLink "The Dennis Miller"  show last night (What kind of website is that anyways?  It isn't even a website.), and a member of the panel said one reason he is voting for Bush is because he has been the most Israel-friendly president in recent history. Israel, another interesting topic when it comes to peace and the American way.        I wish I had some links for my thoughts.  It looks more exciting when there are  urlLink colors .                     Maybe, tomorrow.  Hopefully, forever.
There is this little part of me that wants to post a blank blog and that little part is fear.  Posting my thoughts, my ponderings, and rants seems a little presumptuous.  The act assumes that there will be a reader, and I am not really sure who would want to read.  Then, there is the other part that screams to be heard and demands she will be read.  I recently read an article about " urlLink Blog Lit " and I was left thinking, "Well, why not?," which seems to be my latest approach to life.  At the age of 25, I am planted firmly in a "quarter-life" crisis.  The title again presumptuous as who is to assume that they will live to 100, but I did not create the label, but the category has created a new market segment.  And the segment has  urlLink a book, a website, and now a conference  .  So, the quarter-life crisis.  I haven't read the official diagnosis, but for me it means floundering about searching for a passion, scared that my life will end without accomplishment, working half-heartedly at jobs I feel are meaningless, and beating myself up for not being the 25 year-olds who organize  urlLink Bonnaroo  or the 15-year old who started her own internet consulting firm.  (Her name is  urlLink Laima Tazmin .)  Obviously, if greatness hasn't found me, then I am not meant for greatness.  That is what my quarter-life crisis dictates.  I have quit my job as a Motoring Advisor, aka MINI Cooper Salesperson, after quitting my jobs as an investment banking analyst for Lehman Brothers, a waitress for the Atlanta Fish Market, and a nanny for an unnamed family in Buckhead.  Perhaps my greatness is my ability to quit.  Somehow I don't believe that will garner great accolades in Horatio Alger's homeland.     But, I am here, and I too need to be heard, or perhaps I just need to be written.  And so it begins, the ponderings of a self-proclaimed heroine who worries about world peace, the rise of women, the fall of children, and how one becomes a Top 40 rock s
