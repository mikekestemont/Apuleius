message.  I saw some people my dad's age standing up.  I was thinking, "Ok, if you were in D-DAY, then I was in 'Nam."  The memorial service ended in prayer, and then we all dispersed.  The coolest part of the entire day though however, was when I got my book, The Bedford Boys, signed by the author Alex Kershaw and one of the only surviving Bedford Boys left Roy O. Stevens.  I also got my picture with Kershaw.  Me and Roy talked for a little while, and I was in slow mo.  All of a sudden, I spurted out "What was it like there? I can only imagine.." and he says to me "Have you ever seen Private Ryan?" I say, "Yes." and he goes, "It was just like that.  Just like that.."  I thanked him not only for signing my book, but for doing what he did when he was just a young man in the military, and then left with the biggest smile on my face ever.  Dad and I soon left, and the ride home was so boring, I just fell asleep.  Reflecting back on the day, it was one of the most special days of my life.

What an interesting year it's been.  In the past 6 months, I've met and spoken with former President Jimmy Carter, met two Nobel Peace Prize winners, Elie Wiesel, and Jimmy Carter.  And met many veterans of D-DAY and WW2.  Music Currently Playing:  This Would Be Easier If You Would Just Die by Park.

You know, someone said that to me today, and I was thinking.   "Wow, you are, you know you are so funny.  Do you write your own material? Because that is so fresh.  I've never heard anyone reference that outside the program before.  And yet you've taken that and used it out of context to insult me in this everyday situation.  What a clever person you must be to come up with a joke like that.  It's so fresh too, any Titanic jokes you want to throw at me as long as we're throwing out these phenomena at the height of their popularity? Because you know I'm here.  God, you are SO funny."  Stewie from Family Guy originally said this, but this actually did happen and that is EXACTLY what I t
