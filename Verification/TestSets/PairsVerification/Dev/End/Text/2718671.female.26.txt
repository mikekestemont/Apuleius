WEIGHT!   The scale said around 180.5 Lbs...which means I lost another pound and a half since Thursday.  I notice my eating habits yesterday and I definitely eat less than 1100 calories a day on weekends.  Based on the Bally's gym test, I decide to continue eating that amount of calories on the weekends and work out longer to burn even more calories...plus my water weight is probably coming off..So it makes sense.  Well I'm off to shower and watch some movies with hubby..  ~Besos~
Well today I got my ass up and went to the gym....did cardio for for a half and then worked on my triceps...I finally came up with a new plan I need to work out...I want 2 do biceps one day, legs the next, then biceps (gives them time to rest), then start over....and do abs at home with yoga..sounds like a nice routine.   So something possessed me to get on the scale.... AND I LOST 1 1/2 POUNDS SINCE MONDAY!!!!    I don't know how I did it, but I DID *smiling very smuggly right about now*    &nbsp;   I'm gone....
OK OK OK....I KNOW I'VE BEEN A BAD GIRL *HANGING HEAD IN SHAME*     For the past two weeks...I have barely been to the gym or to yoga....however I have continued with my eating habits...and happy to announce I have lost   2 MORE POUNDS!      However I went back to the gym on Monday and will do yoga tomorrow morning.&nbsp;  Honestly since I haven't been to the gym (the bytch took all my staminia), I really didn't have much to write.&nbsp; I'm still using the pedometer everyday I go out and trying to be more social and see the city....but this damn rain is driving me nuts.&nbsp; Every other day, it's raining and runing some plans...I wish Bally's would rent lockers, becuase right now I only have 1 pair of sneakers to work out in and I hate walking home....from the gym....with soaking wet sneakers!&nbsp; Ugggghhhh I hate that!     So for now I'm going to try to go to the gym in the monrings as well as some afternoons (I notice there's alot of kids there, with vacation and the gym's child care center)...so I figured if I wake up, and it's raining, go to the gym and get it done early so I can come str8 home from work and relax.    Well that's all for now.....     &nbsp;   "Do it...Do it Do it!!!!"    - from Starsky & Hutch     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;
I just got in the house from yoga and it was WONDERFUL.      Instead of my regular basics class, I took sunset rooftop yoga with the own of LLYC down near the Village.  It was so peaceful and calming, watching the bright red sun set while doing asanas I haven't  even  attempted yet!  The pace was faster than I expected, but I just went at my own pace and took child's pose if needed.        Otherwise its the same ole same ole....I'll holla a little later, going to take a shower.      God Bless Dave Chapelle and his $50 Million Dollar Contract...He's rich b
