family. Since I've been married I've gotten closer to both my mom and dad. It's weird how living out on my own can change my life and has made me mature more. I look at things so much differently. I cherish the moments I get to spend with my husband which are rather slim these days. I'm just thankful for having a loving family and husband. It's a shame that work has to get in the way of things you enjoy most. I try not to think too much on this but here lately all I've been thinking about is wanting to see my family more. Since I've been married it's like all I do is work but I gotta work. Maybe something good will come along soon. All I can do is keep praying to God and hope that it happens soon. I'm so proud of Jason he tries his hardest to be a good video editor. The way he's grown toward God makes me really look up to him. I know it sounds crazy but I really admire my husband. He stands up for what he believes in and has made me grow even closer to God.
Man all I've been doing here lately is griping about juveniles. There are too many in this town that get arrested. Parents half the time don't want to pick them up or try to leave them here for punishment. This is really bugging me don't parents know that they can punish them at home? They seem to think we can hold them up to twenty-four hours which not true. I have to tell them time and time again that our policy states that we are to get placement for these kids ASAP. We have problems with a boys home in town not picking their AWOL's up in a decent time when they are only a block away. DHS half the time don't know what they are doing as far as placing their kids. County Juvenile seems to be the only ones to get things done.  It just doesn't seem like the system cares about these kids. I thought they are there to help but seeing this side doesn't seem that way at all. One thing I can say about my job is that it makes me thankful for the family I have.
AHG!! Today at work sucked we had four juveniles come in the last few hours of work. I usually don't mind them in but I absolutely hate it when we get drunks in. Well what do you know we had a drunk in and he was not very coherent at all. I totally freak out worrying that they might vomit. I cannot stand being in a room with someone who's throwing up. I just hope and pray that they either make it to the bathroom or toilet in time. Thank God that school is going to start in about three weeks. There sure has been alot of drunks in lately. Well I'm just started this blog and I'll see how it g
