we would have to go from a Fri to a Mon or Tue. Sorry, but I am not using extra leave because of shitty planning.  I have no doubt that we will have fun...just let me know what is going on so I can adjust the leave that is on the books (for the second time).  If this isn't sorted out and final by Aug 15 then I am just going to take my leave off the books.  ST...EDITED OUT....
