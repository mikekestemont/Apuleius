I finally pick up our SIX, yes, 6, funnel cakes and maneuver my way back to the blanket on the beach to wait for the show.  You would think people would be a little more considerate of a pregnant woman waddling threw the masses with a stack of six funnel cakes.  Nope.  They probably all figured I was going to sit in a corner and eat all of them myself!    Anyways, we gorged ourselves on our tasty treats, and had a great old time.  We even got the priviledge of a drunk narration on the pretty colors of the different fireworks.  "GREEEEEN!!!  REEEEDDDD!!!  OOOOOH PURRRPPPLE!!!"  SK2 isn't usually fond of fireworks, and this year wasn't any different.  They had these ones that like shot out of the ground, and he informed us that they looked like a dragon breathing fire out of the ground and that it was coming to get him.  I don't think SK3 liked the fireworks either.  She was just a kicking away in my belly.  Guess I should be thankful she missed the bladder while slam-dancing.  No going to the porta-potties for me this year!  YAY!!!  Okay, so the day was kinda boring...  But it's tradition, so it's a good kind of boring.
I woke up this morning, and was instantly depressed.  What should be a fun day, as the four of us are going to a concert, is shaping up to be blah.  Why?  It's July already.  Most would think that's a good thing, but not me.  Being July means that I only have another 3 weeks until I have to load my babies onto an airplane for a 2000 mile flight across the states to TN and the ex-moron.  That's not so bad, except he doesn't know how to deal with them.  He's never had to.  I've always been mom and dad for the most part.  But in TN also is the ex-moron's psychotic bitch of a mother.  OY!!!  I would rather cut off my toes than have my children subjected to this psycho!  There is a LOT of background there as far as why I feel this way, but trust me.  The bitch is crazy.  She needs to get mental help, ASAP!  She was on Prozac and felt she didn't need it anymore, so she quit taking it.  Umm, no.    So, I woke up, and realized it was July.  What did I do?  What any self-respecting yet overly hormonal woman would do... cried.  *rolling my eyes*  And I am so not an emotional person.  I blame SK3 totally for this!  The lil evil one who plays with my intestines like it's a pinata.  I keep trying to convince SKSO to let me hire a hitman.  He says it's too expensive.  I say the therapy I'm going to need one day will be more expensive than a one time payment to a hitman.    And then, what should I roll across today but this entry from  urlLink ASB  about her hubby.  Hmm, maybe it's divine intervention.  Or maybe my homicidal tendencies are making it seem that w
