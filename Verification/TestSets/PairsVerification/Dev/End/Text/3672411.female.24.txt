the blogging train..   urlLink Michael Moore joins .
I got lost with  urlLink the Magnetic Fields  last night. Herbal refreshments aside, it was a fantastic show. Stephin and Claudia had some witty banter going on in spite of Merritt's series of bad pun jokes (the church they played at was unbearably hot--what with no ceiling fans and stained glass windows that couldn't open and all--so he left in the middle of the set to fetch a portable fan to put onstage after which he said "Well we thought we'd have at least one fan onstage tonight").  Opener  urlLink Andrew Bird  was another standout. I was expecting to hear some cheesy local schmo, like the performer outside the church who was clutching a Jewish "Uncle Maury" type hat while he was barefoot and singing, but was pleasantly surprised by his amazing  urlLink Murray Torkildsen  type voice and talent on the violin.  The Fields are doing a completely different setlist tonight and  urlLink I'm tempted to go again  although I don't think I will, as I'm trying to conserve money my last week here.  Best: Smoke and Mirrors, All My Little Words, I Die  I completely forgot my digital camera, so there's nothing to post from the show..sorry about that :(..but here's a totally unrelated photo from an unrelated performance..
urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11  was very persuasive and compelling, but I have to admit that while you're watching it you can't help but feel as if many of the clips are *very* strategically cut. I hestiate to use the word manipulative here, but I suppose that's  urlLink Moore 's whole point.     I think  urlLink the overtone is pretty much what a lot of people are secretly thinking but not necessarily wanting to believe ..  While the piece is far from flawless, it does remind us of this:   It's all about the money, honey . And covering your ass to keep the money at all costs. But then, we all knew that already, right?  Here's Peter on our way to the theatre:     I'm going to also confess that I have something of a soft spot for Moore. He answered all my emails when I used his film  urlLink The Big One  back in 1997 for a high school World Issues project. He was very encouraging to me, asked me some questions about Ontario and was generally very sweet (maybe in the same way a cantankerous old uncle trying to sway you to their views might be).  I'm still disappointed the  urlLink Rainbow Theatre  matinees were completely sold out. I'm sorry about that guys, I didn't even think to call and/or buy tickets ahead of time, but duh..I guess all cheap people were flocking to the theatre downtown.  Fireworks are going to start soon. Time for me to fetch my earplugs...
urlLink Amy  needs to get rid of a pair of Van Halen tickets. They're nosebleeds, for $100* a pop (* Note : very negotiable).  Sammy is back if that sweetens the pot.  You'd totally be helping her out..you can email me if you want to hook it u
