Ant reads this blog before tomorrow (which I am sure he won't), he will realise that there is a belated birthday suprise for him tomorrow - that is if he makes it in tomorrow.  It was his birthday on Sunday, and being busy people as we are, we forgot.  Well to be honest, I have been rather busy of late and hadn't given it much thought.  I have been number crunching so much recently that all I seem to dream about are numbers floating in the air, and in binary too - that is too freaky!   Organising birthday suprises seems to be my second occupation in the office.  For some reason, I always end up buying the cake - and I hope I am not the person to buy my own birthday cake in September.  I guess we have a tradition of buying each of our colleagues cake, not the otherway around, like in other offices.  So, what do we get Ant for his birthday?  I have no idea, but D has kindly volunteered me to get that too... Am I a sucker or what?  Hmm, I wonder, do they sell a DVD of Trisha at Costco...
Today I decided to work from home.  It is degree congregation time so we have lots of lost souls wandering around the campus, parking is a nightmare and to cap it all, the office opposite ours is being renovated.  Renovation in the terms where they are knocking down walls and drilling from the hours of nine to five - which is not conducive to being able to work, even with my Â£30 headphones from Maplin.  maybe I should have taken them back.  But then again, maybe I am avoiding the office as there is too many people about - too many interactions with so little time.  I shall have to go back to the office a little later, as there are some experiments I want to carry out, but half a day without noise is better than a whole day of noise.  And then I will finish the day off by going to see Timmy after work and maybe if I am lucky, we can have a coffee together (though we tend to drink tea instead).
Today was an exceptionally wet day.  After a couple of very hot and sunny days, the weather broke with torrential rain.  I was working late this evening - in the vain hope that I would get some more stuff done for the thesis.  Writing up Chapter Two this week.  Anyway, I was on my way home and stopped off at my big sister's shop to collect my little sister and we were walking to the car which is about 100 meters away when a car drove past and splashed us from head to toe with icky rain water, to the great amusement of the the guys who run the pizza shop we were walking past.  So much for carrying an umbrella - we still got wet.  Oh well, c'est la vie!
