Menace '.... Sounds like another superhero I know of, who doesn't wear a mask, just a well ironed suit. George Bush is a modern day superhero. He put all his sh*t on the line to save the lives of millions of Iraqi's, what thanks does he get??? Big Media reporting that Iraq is another Vietnam ( Gee, I had a feeling that we lost Vietnam and I'm under the impression that we just re-wrote Iraq's government ourselves, for the better , wow I must be retarded or something ) He gets the Abu Ghraib Scandal, because didn't you know that George Bush while enjoying a late night snack called up a lowly ranked Prison guard and informed him how to torture iraqi's, I mean it's common knowledge I heard Al Gore and Teddy Kennedy have a copy of the phone conversations somewhere. And we get the Media reporting what a failure Fallujah has become, even though most soldiers and officers I've heard said we defeated most of the insurgents there.... You see there's a conspiracy here..... The Media wants you to think that George Bush is a Villian, an Evil Doer and a Crook because that's what they are, they want to divert the attention off themselves an onto someone else, and who betta??? The President of the United States, Why??? Because it's cool to hate on him... Why???? Because Hollywood and the Elite call him stupid... WHY????? Well..... ( Crickets Chirping ) Ummmmmmm He just is, because they heard it from someone else who said he had a funny accent....      George Bush is Peter Parker minus the Spiderman Outfit, He sticks up for what's right, defends the people who can't defend themselves, has a strong sense or morality and most importantly Sticks true to his beliefs no matter who or what doubts him... Personally with the way Media and Most of America treats him, I would have called a speech and told people ' Fine, you want me gone, I'm gone, I hate you anyways, I've busted my sack here for four years, defended you and kept you safe from those and others intent on destorying us like they tried on september 11th, you want another one??? Fine, you can have it, as for me, I'm gonna go to my super secret hideaway in Texas on a Ranch and relax, good luck with Long Face Jenkins as your new President, you're gonna need it, you ungrateful bastards! 'Then he can put his fingers in the side of his mouth and whistle and a galaint steed could come through the window of the white house and he hops on and puts on a cowboy hat and rides off. He doesn't need this junk anymore..... Personally I'd love to see George Bush go on the Celebrity Boxing circuit and take on people like Al Gore and Ted Kennedy and Hilary Clinton... I'd pay money to see that and for him to connect a few donkey punches to there sideburns.... Then score a fatality like in ' Mortal Kombat '.... Word.... I'm O
