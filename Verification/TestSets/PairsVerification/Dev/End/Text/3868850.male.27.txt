time around.  On a differnet note, I was disappointed in the t-shirt designs.  They need someone that can design a good t-shirt.  That didn't stop me from blowing $60 on a t-shirt and sweatshirt.  So maybe they don't need a better designer.  The weather has been beautiful out here, but it's suppposed to start getting warmer--mid 80s and low 90s.  I haven't even looked at the schedule yet, but I know the 800 rounds are up today.  At least I hope they are.   I'll try posting again tonight or tomorrow morning.
12:40 (Sac Time)  We're here!  Unfortunately, the place we're staying doesn't have any high speed access.  They only have a 56k data port on the side of their phone.  Ugh.  So, I'll be posting from the Kinkos down the street from our hotel.  And I was too tired to post last night when I found out we didn't have any access.  The meet starts in about three hours.  The weather is perfect.  It's not as hot as last year...yet.  Other than that, there is not much to report until the action gets started.

This is my first post.  Despite the name of the blog this will most likely have nothing to do with baseball.  Although, the Brewers might get a couple of comments.  Who would have thought?  I can thank Cukes for the name of this blog.  Cukes and I ran track (and Cross Country) at UW-Oshkosh together--mostly the steeplechase.  Anyway, he was Mr. Statistic.  It didn't matter the sport, he was always trying to memorize averages, draft picks, number of Gatorade showers, etc.  Sometimes our team used to waste away the time on the way to far away meets by quizzing each other from a sports almanac.  If Cukes wasn't quizzing us, he was firing off correct answers before I even could comprehend the question.    So he introduced me to the Mendoza Line.  It is a batting average. .200 or .250, I'm not real sure.  And honestly, I really don't care because baseball is not one of my favorite sports.  It was just a fun little nickname, and it reminds me of some good running times.  Beth (my wife for those of you that don't know me) and I leave for Sacramento tomorrow morning at five.  It's Olympic Trials time!  I plan to add a post each night, and I might even add some photos if I can.  The last trials, also in Sacramento, were a blast.  It's impossible (if you're a track and field fan) not to be excited.  This is the cream of America's crop battling it out for three spots on the Olympic team.  Every race means something.  I was lucky enough to run in a few Division III National Meets, and I thought I was nervous then.  I can't even begin to imagine how big the butterflies are in the stomachs of the athletes when they walk to the starting l
