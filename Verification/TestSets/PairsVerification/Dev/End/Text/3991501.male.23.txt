irony: safe through steel and wheel, safe from the gradual tsunami of melting ice caps, sipping gradually melting iced caps as sea level laps at mud flaps. The hot brands heat atmosphere as soft bellies wince at the hot brand of seatbelt metal.  Today N turns four.  Average years more: 74.  The baking party train is stationary on the tracks that go nowhere but to fantasy.
He was our second peddler of the day.  Our fingers were sticky with the remains of chocolate-covered almonds and he arrived.    "Let's see what goodies he brought!"    We ran down the stairs like children excited about their first pudding bath.  I jumped over the last step, taking care not to look above at the haunted mirror.  We zipped through the Mailroom and past the Telegraph Room.  We came to a halt in the Waiting Room.  Alas.  He only had a binder.  We thought he would unravel all his wares, so we could point and say "that one."  He told jokes that elicited the sort of laughter one laughs out of politeness, taking care not to laugh too hard, lest the joke-teller takes it as permission for an encore.    The Man from Puce Creek, noting our laughter, tried another one, to make up for the first.

Exhaustion breeds paranoia and the paranormal.  Are humans more sensitive to abnormal presences when in a state of stress?  Is it the mind that "invents" stimuli to continue producing endorphins in order to stay awake?   Will the ghoulies in the basement make contact with the living again?  It is my scientific proposal that on a certain moonless night this month a Ouija board ( urlLink homemade? ) could be brought to the basement for communicating to the hidden spirit.  We should find out where its from, who it is and what it wants.  Also it is a good excuse to eat the chocolate cake that is sitting in the freezer, just waiting to be gobbled.
Our first recorded death in the Museum took place this afternoon at 3:05 PM.  At 8:10 PM, I accidentally, rather brutally stabbed myself with a big knife while trying to open a bag of popcorn.  Enough blood to douse a paper towel with red polka dots seeped out of my finger.  I attribute this incident not to the 3:05 death, but rather to the noisy spirit - that gaunt shoulish basement m
