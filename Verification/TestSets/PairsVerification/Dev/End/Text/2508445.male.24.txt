sweet tasting nuance.  I enjoyed this taste, but I don't think that the tea was as good as I originally thought it would be.  The second tea for today was the Darjeeling rhapsody 22 from Adagio.  This tea had a pale amber color.  When infusing, the leaves didn't separate or enlarge as much as the other teas.  #22 seems to be a nice medium bodied tea with a delicate flavor and a slight hint of a pleasant smell.    That's all for now, hopefully I'll have more tonight.  -Matt
A bit drowsy, a bit late.  Slow moving yet building speed.  White Swan running with me, exploding in its flowered display.  The moment comes, the moment anticipated.  Church bells ring, the time has come.  What a way to start the day!
Well, so far, I've had 5 teas exclusively for myself.  (In chronological order) Zhuan Cha, red bloom, golden needle, Kings tea, and assam melody.  All except the kings tea were from adagio.   The Adagio teas are very exquisite teas.  The flavour development with all the teas were exceptional.  Zhuan Cha and red bloom are both display teas which explode into marvelous shapes when infused.  I would say my most favorite tea of the 5 so far would be the red bloom.  This tea has a smooth flavour and a delicate aroma.  The taste at first is a traditional black, but the smooth flavour at the end leaves your mouth feeling fresh and ready for more.
Today started with a delightful cup of Berry Black Fruitea Darjeeling black tea from Numi during work in the mid-morning. This tea boasts a invigorating strength wrapped with a sweet fruit coating, perfect for those lazy morning taste buds.   For the Afternoon I opted for a more relaxing cup of Pina Colada tea from Adagio Teas.  This fragrant tea has a subtle flavor with a natural sweetness that can easily carry one through the afternoon with a smile.  The evening brought with it a delightful host of teas to calm and sooth the soul.  A rousing cup made from Hibiscus flowers prepared the mind for a few hours of stimulating conversation as the warm beverages flowed all around. As the company became more contemplative a cup or Lemon Grass from Adagio Teas helped me to wax the philosophical. And lastly a smooth cup of Chamomile from Adagio Teas with a dollop of honey prepared me to drift of in to the land of dreams full of pleasant thoughts.

Well, It looks as though the end of the year has come, And so, with a heavy heart, we sign off until next semester. Sigh, Hopefully however, we will get updates on new tea and other such items through the summer from our seperated society of tea snobs. I for one will do my best to keep you all informed of the new happenings and experiences of tea.  The End...for n
