first race (at nationals), and she doesn't  want to follow that example. The below pics are from a regatta from a  couple of weeks ago. Hannah and I went and had fun - regattas are fun  to watch - screaming from the shore-line, chanting C-R-I, C-R-I, C-R-I  [that's the club name  urlLink Community Rowing ]  She's the one in the headband.      __ wayde tardif
So my internet is back up . . .  still no idea why it was down these past few days. Worked today on the Newton House - still trying to figure out the damn stair - the whole thing is tight and there is barely any room to work - I think I have it figured out now.  Here are a couple of relatively recent pics of me
It seems that the firm I am to start with  urlLink Gleysteen Design  has delayed my start, yet again - now they want me to start on Thursday, instead of Wednesday. I think I'll tell them that I'd rather start the following Monday at this point. Besides, I've never really got a good vibe from these guys from the start. They seem to do good work, but seem a bit un-trusting and shifty . . . not a way to start a long-term professional relationship. At any rate, during my 3 month "probationary" period, I will continue to look for work - as they said, they want to give the interactions between them a me a close-up look-see and determine if I can perform as my portfolio suggests!! That blows me away! They must have been burned by someone at some point . . . Geeze I hate that people who come before others screw things up for those who come along thereafter - it has happened professionally, and personally as well - isn't every relationship a case of that? So I'll continue to opursue the other firms who have been interested in me over this time I have had ( urlLink SBRA  and   urlLink  Ganteaume )  I have come down to the shop today  urlLink Quad Cycles   to use their internet connection - mine isn't working at home for some reason . . . I also have to tighten my bottom-bracket cartridge on my road bike, as it seems to be the only thing on my bike that I have yet to tighten, and the click, click, click, click upon every pedal stroke is driving me a bit crazy (especially since I don't know where the hell it is coming from) - it undermines your performance on the bike too - like something might break if you push too hard . . .  I'll probably ride 60-70K this afternoon, and take advantage of the fact that I have these days to ride whenever I want - that luxury is over next week. I might race Wompatuck this evening if the weather breaks. I haven't raced down there in ages . . . and maybe I'll look up Chris Hidell too while I'm down there.  Hope everyone is well -   W
