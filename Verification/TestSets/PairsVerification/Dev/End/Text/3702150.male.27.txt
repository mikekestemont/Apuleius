While we were toasting the Gods last night, we did pour out a little alcoholic concoction last night in the company of friends here at Chez Murphy. Lea, my french teacher and good friend is in town from Texas Tech University. So, since I have not had a night out in a while from working I arranged a rendezvous at the Flying Saucer, my little watering hole. We had some good conversation and then headed back to my place for some cheese and wine. The weather could not have been better, almost chilly as I walked my guests outside in the waning hours of the morning. Then, since the sleep patterns have me like a little nocturnal social butterfly, I headed over to Kat & Caya's place for a little delve into politics, religon, anything else that can cause controversy. I am 25 days away from my departure for France. I hope that the people that I am in contact with there are as great as those that I have met over the past few years. Kat, Caya, Jacob, Michael, Lea, Come, Homere(when you find the place), Tolu, etc........ You have made the past year one that I am going to remember for years to come. I would like to say that we will all meet up again one night when the planets line up for us, but, if it never happens I wish you all  the best. We are the future, and although we will become the past, let nothing stand in your way. Do not take "no" for an answer, if you will it then you can make it.  Ok, that is enough of the power talk for today. To get your very own "Power of Pursuit" video seminar please send $59.95 in cash, certified check, money order, or bearer's bonds to Sean.

Well, as I get closer to leaving I knew that there would be a big push to get things done before I leave and a possible bump in the road as well. I am at the bump right now, I am going to push through and make everything work out. I am working so much that I have no life, and it is all going into my truck, just to sell it. I wisj I never would have gotten this truck in the first place but my Honda was stolen and it happened. It is a great truck and I would like to keep it, but I would much rather have my freedom form the payments while I am in Lyon. I guess that I am just having a rough day and I need to "push on through to the other s
