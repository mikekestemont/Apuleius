me back home during law school but once again i have choosen to leave them or maybe they have made the choice for me. i spent last night just lying in bed thinking about them and about chiku and feeling this intense sense of gratitude for having the life that i have. looking back it seems like there was never a time that i felt i lacked something, be it material or theoritical. sometimes i wish dad had been around more but had that been the case, we might still be living in india and i might not be feeling the way i do now. he is by far one of the most amazing men in this world. i know that everyone says that kinda stuff about their dad but sometimes i really feel like he's unreal. by far the most open-minded, free- thiking person i know. his creativity and courageousness is uncanny; how many people can drop everything at the age of 40 and move their whole life to a foreign country and be left with no roots? I can't do that at 23 let alone at 40!  as for mom, i am so fu(king amazed at how shes done it. raising us two by herself with dad gone most of the time, her career and well just about everything else. for all those times that i resent her for not letting me go, whatever that means, there are an infinte more times that she has been the most amazing woman that i have ever met. her strength, her independence (of mind also), her resiliance, her rebelious spirit, her beauty. finally, chiku. where can i even being except that i really think we were suppose to be twins. i feel like he understands me better than anyone in this world and even more importantly, he accepts me with all my faults and hangups. he has been my constant through everything and i wish sometimes he knew just how much i love him. by far the most articulate, creative, radical, humble, talented, knowledgable person that i know. i can go on forever, but in short-your family is all you really got and with them, ive got it all.
sometimes i want to crawl into your thoughts and stay awhile/file myself into your memory card because its safer that way/stay there till we forget where we came from but moreso where we're going/flowing in and out from lives past/last night i dreamt of her hands/the calloused roughness that caressed us/her 40 years multiplied by the number of children she raised/fazed out in their lives/but i/i dreamt of our life past/the dusty streets...the stench of cow dung/hung over us like a badge of pride/you running the 100 meter-dash/images flash before my mind/our superhero dad indulging our American dreams with toys for thoughts/you trying to fill shoes too big/digs deep into my soul/role that mom was dad&amp;mom must have been tough/rough with us chasing imaginary ideals but rougher when they came crashing down/last night i dreamt of her hands/flowing in and out from lives p
