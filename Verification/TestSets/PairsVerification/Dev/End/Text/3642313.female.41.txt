too big to cry  If I knew then what I know now You'd still be kissing me But now there are other lips Were my lips used to be  You never looked so beautiful As on the day you walked away I used to say 'I love you' Now that's something I can't say  I can't forget you, baby No matter how hard I try But you'll never know how much I'm hurt Because I'm too big to cry
Love me in the circle of your evening, And in the morning quiet of your dreams. Love me underneath ambitious schemes, And when they slow and time can use some seasoning.  I do not need your highways and your streets As long as I can be there when you're home. We both have miles of paradise to roam: Let me be where your brave heart retreats.  And I will love you in the times of tears, Of hope and laughter, pain and ecstasy, And all the days of haunted thoughts, when we Can share the undertow of vanished years.
