taken have led you to the wrong place? That's what I've been wondering lately. It doesn't have anything to do with E, or my life with him. But more with my choice in extra curricular activities. I think that all my time that I've devoted to being a good sailor and a good student, have cost me more than I may ever know.
The list came out today.  You might be asking "what list is that?"  But you would be asking the wrong question.  The right question is "who's list is that?"  Answer:  The dean's list And I am on it!
Ok, enough with the guilt trips. I'll write already. One of my teachers taught me a new word in Arabic today. It's the term for one who can't bear to be separated from a loved one. They actually have a word for it. She told me it's going to be my new name if I don't perk up a little. The truth is, I don't feel like perking up. I'm lonely. I want my E back. He's been gone since Sunday, and I don't get him back till Saturday afternoon. It just doesn't seem right that I have to be without him already. I thought that was the point of getting married, so that you could be together. And further more, I am on this crazy diet, not by choice. I never can stick out diets of my own choosing, but this one is a little more important. I have to be on it for 2 weeks before they do my nuclear cancer scan. I don't really want a false negative or a false positive on this test, so I'm doing my best. But it is so hard. Basically all pre-packaged food has salt in it. That salt is almost guaranteed to be iodized, and therefore, off limits to me. So, unless I made it with my own two hands, it's impossible to know whether they used the right salt, or whether they put egg yolks or dairy products in it. In addition to that, have you ever read the ingredients on food? It says stuff like, "This product may contain less than 2% of the following..." It may contain? It scares me that they don't know. And if you aren't allowed to eat it, you aren't allowed to eat even 2% of it. Oh, and I'm still not properly balanced. God I sound like a wreck don't I? Well, I feel it. So, I'm tired, cold &amp; moody because of the thyroid thing. Crabby and jonesing for french fries because of the diet. And very lonely at home because of the E thing. On the plus side, the side effect of boredom is a very clean house.
13 hours down and only 130 hours to go until I get my  E back.  I'm not sure if I'm going to make it.  All you East Coasters better have a good time hanging out with him cause you aren't getting him back for a long time.  I miss him too much when he's g
