touch of OCD – or else I’m just terribly perfectionistic. But they tend to go hand in hand.  We have listened to Josh Groban, Clint Black, Matilda on CD recording, How to Eat Fried Worms on CD recording, and now Kenny Chesney. Three of those are my mother’s and combined, I’ve heard them all more than Wicked and Rent combined. Yep – that. Damn. Much. I’m dying to listen to Rent now, but I’m nearly out of battery juice. Kenny’s okay for now.  My mom, thank the heavens, gave me her book she finished. Anna Quindlen’s “Object Lessons.” It’s rather good, but I think I would enjoy it more if I could stop thinking about the computer.  Our hamster has taken refuge with our neighbors, Brenden and Claire Murphy. We’re only halfway through Ohio and I’m fairly itching to be back home…  Sometimes when you lie on the beach with your eyes closed, you can see the waves.  8:48 PM. V. dark… can’t see what I’m writing. Storming like hell… cleared enough to see road but still amazing. Trying to listen to Rent but storm droning it out.  10:10 PM. Back through Van Wert and so v. tired. Want to go to bed.  10:57 PM. Rolling along dear old St. Joe Ctr. Road. Can’t see a bloody thing! *smiles* The Wyndemere sign!! Whoo!! Rolling… *waves to Hillary and Diana*  Oh, hello, house J  You’ve been a great audience, really… goodnight!!
I am officially a Jones addict.  This is not entirely my fault. A good friend of mine named Paul Ensley bought me and Sam bottles for our math pizza party (Crushed Melon - tastes like Skittles) and I was a moth, drawn to the flame... and now the fire has ceased, and I am a butterfly crushed on the wheel!! [/Chicago] So today I had to go to Naked Clay Cafe and fulfill my addiction. I had Berry Lemonade. For some reason it was good when I was drinking it, but it wasn't satisfying... I always felt like I needed more - when I was drinking it and when I wasn't.  Sounds kinda like life. Mind you, I didn't come up with that metaphor myself. Credit to Paul Ensley for the whole "relationships are like beverages" thing. It's very interesting, actually. Bug him about it, will you?  Oh, and I've started a bottle collection. I figure I will collect so many that I can barely fit them in my room and then take them all out to be recycled. Cause I'm a good little consumer like that.  Now, onto my Q of the M.... forgive and forget. This expression confuses me. I realize the intent is to say "Forgive people for what they've done to you and don't hold it against them." But - if you completely forget whatever the mistake was in the first place, what's to say it won't happen again? We're supposed to learn from our mistakes AND forgive and forget. FORGETTING usually doesn't result in LEARNING, and I should know. Just think of science class, for Bob's s
