of luck this next year...they're going to be missed by me...  Wednesday I was sick to my stomach all day.    Thursday was my last day of work.  That night I drove Ken to his home in Coal City to pick up his new computer.  His mom got us dinner and I spent time with his family and two dogs.  It was so much fun!  His family is very funny and I also watched a little bit of that creepy VH1 movie about Michael Jackson with his older sister.  Creepy is the perfect way to describe it.  That's all I will say.  Friday I spent the morning moving out of my apartment with my mom and Ken.  With out their help, I'd still be there eating ceral in a corner not knowing what to do next.  I have a lot of stuff.  Saturday is today and I am at my parent's house in Fox Lake and my brother is here with soon to join my sister, her husband and daughter Ava for dinner.  I'll take pictures with my NEW DIGITAL CAMERA and post them later.  Have a wonderful day and thanks for reading!
This is a picture of my Bible Study group...well, most of them.  Do you see the cupcakes in front of us?  They were made for me by the girl to the left of me (i'm wearing the ET t-shirt) and they said, "We'll miss you Shandog".  It was such a special night to me.  Everyone in the group spoke about some memory they had with me and gave me some advice for Korea.  I didn't realize that there are aren't any dryers in Korea, as in the machines that dry your clothes after you wash them.  Oh well...I guess you'll see future blogs of a sopping wet Shannon looking confused.  Thank you Leonard for heading the study that night and thank you to everyone for what you had said and for the advice.  I will miss you all SO MUCH.  (all caps = a lot!)
urlLink        urlLink Youngok's Screening     Originally uploaded by  urlLink I like to take pictures .      Hello!  Thank you for visiting my blog...I thought since I am going to Korea because of Youngok Kim, I should introduce who she is.  She was an intern at the animation company where I work.  We became good friends by working on her animation that she was having this screening for.  SHE did the animation, I was just the voice of the cat.  It's a REALLY good animation and in one week she'll be heading out to SIGGRAPH in L.A to accept her first place award for the student animation competition...this is a HUGE deal.  Tons of students enter this in this country and only 4 winners are selected and she was number 1!  So that's really good....After Youngok's screening, we all went out to celebrate...that's Youngok on the left (holding one of her animated characters), Roy (who also helped with sound), Heidi (Youngok's old roomate), and myself...see how much I look like my drawing?  (that's sapposed to be a sarcastic c
