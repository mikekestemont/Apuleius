pretty annoying and boring. I told him he should leave when my parents left for the airport (Mom's goin to Las Vegas) but dumbass Scott said it was alright for him to stay, RUINING MY PLAN!! Dumbass. Oh well, it was still kinda fun.  I also finished my hoverboard_wars map for CS, but I might need to add a few more things later. And I don't have anywhere to upload it, so I can't share it with anybody. That was the only map I worked on today. I played another fun map, cs_bikini. It's a beach with a tennis court, pool, and a house. It's really good and someone must have spent about a month on it.  Fuck it, I'm tired, see ya.
Yeah, the past few days I have been playing a lot of Counter-Strike, so I thought, why not make my own maps? So I downloaded Valve Hammer and Wally (for making textures) and I started two maps. It is a lot easier than I thought it would be, and it's a lot of fun. I am making a space station map and a hoverboard wars map. When I am done, I will upload them if I can find some web space. So yeah, I'll be working on those for a long time. I played CS a lot with Alec, but he went on vacation two days ago and won't be back until next Monday. I told him I would have a good map done by the time he gets home.  Also, I downloaded two maps, de_wallmart, and de_desktop from  urlLink RedSquall , and they are  very  good. De_wallmart is an exact replica of a Wallmart store, including the parking lot and bathrooms and everything else that is in the real store. De_desktop is the dude's computer desktop. You can climb into his computer or around the books and boxes and climb wires... all kinds of shit. Very good maps. He has a lot more at his site, I'll check them out later today when it's not before 3:00 AM. lol.  Another thing...  urlLink NewGrounds.com . It's a good site that I just recently signed up for that shows Flash movies and games. There are a few CS movies that I saw today,  urlLink here is the latest and best one . You can click on the guy's profile to see the rest. His first video was made when he was 12! And it didn't suck. He is 15 now and he has made the best Flash videos I have seen in my life. I hope he makes more!  Oh, and one last thing. Matt's party is in like 4 or 5 days! They already tore down both neighbors' fences so they can use those yards during the party. It's gonna be a  huge ass  party! His parents invited about 100 people, his sister invited about 300 and Matt invited around 20, lol. Anyways, it's gonna be fun as hell and I can't wait.  And finally,  one last thing . I'm goin' to sleep cuz I'm about to pass o
