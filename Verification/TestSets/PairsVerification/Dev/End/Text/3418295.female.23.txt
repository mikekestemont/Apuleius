fault.  it is america's fault.  we all stood by and let this happen.  of course, it is partially all those people and institutions' fault.  but it is also our fault.  watching  Fahrenheit 9/11  i realized that america does not stand for justice and right and diplomacy and all the good things.  we are not the good guys.  we are the guys with the greasy hair and bad skin on the dark horses, wearing the black cowboy hats, with the sharp, angry spurs.  we are the bad guys.  and we always have been.  right there, in that moment, i was ashamed of america.  and not in that "yeah, we've made some mistakes, too bad, so sad, sorry bout all those injuns" kind of way.  i am ashamed of what we are.  i hate us.  i hate every single one of us, from President Bush all the way down to myself.  i hate everything this country stands for.  i hate our flag.  i hate every history text i've ever read.  i hate the constitution and the bill of rights.  i hate John Locke and Thomas Jefferson and everyone in between who created our dishonest system of government.  i hate democrats and republicans.  i almost even hate bald eagles, but, really, they're just innocent animals who are just as oppressed by the iron heel of the united states as anyone else (i mean, we did spend 50 or so years trying to drive them to extinction through the use of DDT).  we are bad people.  we stand for terrible things.  we carry out terrible deeds.  on purpose.  with full knowledge of what we are doing.  i hate us.    how am i going to be a lawyer now?

on the back cover of a book called  The Genealogy Of Greek Mythology : "over 17 fet in length on each side!"  of course, this book is a folded-on-both-sides timeline/genealogical chart.  so it is a somewhat apt description.  but still.  would that convince you to buy?  "ooh, 17 feet?  well, you know, if it was 15, i don't think it would be worth it.  but 17 feet of book for only $25?  that's less than  $1.50 per foot!  now that's a deal that can't be beat!"  i'd like to write a book with more square footage than my room, which is, i think, somewhere around 60 sqare feet.  that's 182 pages, if the pages are half the size of standard 8.5 x 11 paper.  totally doable.  and then on the cover, i'd put a big blurb that would say, "more than 60 square feet of book!"
it's been a while.  i just wanted to let everyone out there in the blogosphere know that i'm still here, i'm just a bit busy this week.  in addition to the usual work, school, etc, my brother Chris is in town.  so most of my spare moments have been spent getting him totally wasted, as a good big sister s
