and I can't go back. I'm not prepared at all, not least in that I have tonnes of unfinished / undone / unstarted  homework. Chances are I'll get very little sleep tonight, and I'll be in the worst of moods when some up-her-own-arse student teacher asks for my RE coursework first thing in the morning. That I have to face another 6-7 weeks until the summer holidays is an awful thought, and I just feel like crying.  FUCK.
This should be a blog via-email. Not quite sure  how it works, but if it does, woo.&nbsp;And if Lewis Denby can do it, I might be  able to.
Or works experience, or work sexperience.  Whatever, it's crappy poo. They get free labour, I do pointless work for nothing. "Good morning / afternoon, WTI training group, Adam speaking, how can I help?" It's hammered into me, I'm probably going to start answering real phones with it soon. Not that the phones at work aren't real, but they're not really real, if you see what I mean. Like when someone says "what use will pi be in real life?" to Mr. Easterbrook in maths.  So far, in my three days of being there, I've answered loads of phones and put together a crappy looking desk to replace a really nice solid oak one. You've gotta laugh when you're trading an antique piece of furniture for a flat-packed Ikea MFI MDF DIY Chipboard crap thing.  Recently I've been spending all my money on CDs, which is both a good and a bad thing. It means I'm no longer downloading music that often and stealing for pleasure, but it also means I have no money.  And in the end, HELLO CH-EYE.  Bye.
I let blogging get out of hand again, I think.  I don't honestly know when the last time was, but I think it may have been beginning of last month sometime. So to James Willock, I am sorry.    A year ago I blogged regularly at my old site. It's unbelievable how fast year ten went, and how much better, but at the same time worse, my life is now. Back then, I was angsty and depressed and stuff. I had a girlfriend, but I never saw her. Now I have a real social life and friends whom I actually like rather than just tollerate. I mean, I'm still friends with the others, but they aren't the winners, and stuff, y'know. I'm still friends with Ben, but I'm working on shaking him off. Somehow, though, in retrospect, last year was just so good. I was more laid back, life was so easy. The fact that I had a girlfriend, no matter how little I saw of her, was a good enough excuse to stop putting myself down over that fact that I didn't  really  have one. I had, on the whole, very little to worry about. It's strange, because although I my life is much better now, and I'm probably much happier, I can shake off the feeling that last year felt so much better. Hind sight is c
