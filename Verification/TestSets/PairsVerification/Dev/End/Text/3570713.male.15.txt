Here's a real quick update on apartment living for those of you deprived of this unique experience:       Our neighbor lives a rather suspicious life. She comes in at random times of the night and day and then leaves as quickly as she has come. She left for a whole week one time and seemed to be packing stuff up and out. Then, a police officer came and violently banged on her door when she was gone. He left. Then, two young girls came and went in the apartment and carried off a TV. But, within last week, she returned and has been back on semi-normal hours. My dad has talked to her and she's had a really rough life. My parents feel suspicous towards her but I feel really sorry for her-to me, she seems like a woman who's been through a whole lotta crap in her life and is just trying to get it all together.        Tonight, a major accident occurred right outside the apartment. When my mom and I were coming home from the movies after dropping Kelly off at her home, we found my dad standing outside on the cell phone. When I got out of the car, I noticed our neighbor standing out by the train tracks that are only about 50 yards from the apartment. She and my dad had been outside talking again when someone came flying down our road and got airborne going over the railroad tracks. The car had crashed down in the woods. I ran over to where she was and was looking around while she related to me what had happened. I was informed that I was not allowed to go down (because they believed the drivers to be insane/high/drunk) there (we couldn't see where the car was because it was too dark) to see the car. A car finally came up the road and we could see skid marks where they ran off the road. A little while later the ambulance my dad had called came and went down and found the car in the woods. The driver had fled. No one was left down there. They searched around for them but never found anyone to our knowledge. After we had gone back in, a wrecker came and took the car away.    Apartment living is quite an experience.
yepp folks, i have returned to write an entry...          -there is something that has recently started to REALLY bug me: Random quoting. I mean this in the way that someone just shouts out something that doesnt make hardly any sense unless you have seen a particular movie/heard a particular song/played a particular video game (the latter being the upmost annoyingist)...I wish I had never admitted to seeing red vs. blue because now I am constantly subject to quotes that I can't even write here because I don't remember them..just the annoyingness of them...so folks:drop that terrible habit before I hurt someone.          Thanx d
