ok purpleXfairyXtar: do u still like me? TaLlDuDe1120: not really purpleXfairyXtar: ok... TaLlDuDe1120: ok... I am sooo hurt right now. I am depressed, yet again. I hate Mark. I hate guys... God, I hate the way I feel. And I cant believe I still like him. I am so stupid! I am not going to fall for another guy. At least not for a while. I feel like I could die. Things Im thnkin about: Why do you care about me now when I want to die, and not then when I wanted to live? The scars will last forever, But nothing compares to the pain that put them there. How can someone come into your life for such a short time and leave such a bad scar on your life and heart?
Wow, I am sooo tired. Monday I went to Six Flags with Amber, Tina, and Johnny. It was fun. We get there about 12 and left and 6. I spent the night with her Sunday and Monday night. We stayed up talkin and playin with Katelyn. Then Tuesday I came back home and we went to Tanger Outlet Mall. Then Danielle came over to spend the night *shes here now* and we stayed up until 5 or 6 and then got up at 12. *lol* Today we are just gonna chill here. We might go to church. But I dont know if I wanna go. *shame on me* But, Oh well. Tomorrow I wanna go shopping. Friday I should be going to my mom's house to help with the yard sale. ThenSaturday I am going to drive to Atlanta with Ted. *not fun, not looking forward to it* So, I should keep pretty busy. I might post in between. Who knows...
