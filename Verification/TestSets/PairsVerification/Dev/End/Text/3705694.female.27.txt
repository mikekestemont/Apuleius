dressing to gravy.  So, that's about it for now; tomorrow is the big co-ed flag football tournament, so I should probably rest up, study the play book, look at last week's films, etc. Actually, I think I'll just go out and get piss drunk instead, since you shouldn't change what's working for you.  Cheers! Gabrielle
At about 2:00 this afternoon, I acheived an absolute state of zen.  The reason for this was that I fixed my wireless network, which had been causing me such stress last week that it was actually beginning to effect my mental and physical health.  I was staying up all night, coming home for lunch, basically spending all of my free time consumed with fixing this network.  And, alas, it is done.  Jason and I ate lunch today at Scalea's, a delicious gourmet deli in Covington, and while eating we were discussing some of his issues at work.  After listening to his problems, I told him that I felt he was over-analyzing the situation, and causing his situation to make him stress out even while away from the "office" (seeing as his office this summer consists of a boat, it's funny to call it that).  I told him not to worry, that it'll all work out. I erred in trying to use myself as an example of someone who adheres to the worry-free philosophy.  He mention the wireless network situation mentioned above, and it was at that point I realized I was being hypocritical.    However, I have long been on a mission to become less of a worry-wart.  I stressed myself out so bad in my junior year of high school that I got a bleeding ulcer.  At 16!  Since then, I've definitely spent a lot of time stressing over things, but luckily I haven't gotten the ulcers again.  I try to stay focused of the reality that worrying isn't going to change your situation, so why bother?  I love the Jason Mraz song, "I Won't Worry My Life Away."  It speaks to me... I think so many people spend so much time fretting over things that they can't change overnight anyway-- weight, jobs, money, what others think of them, etc.  Not to say that one should live like some sort of primitive bohemian, but I've never been so happy since I've stopped worrying so much.  The extra pounds will come off in time, as long as I stay active and try to eat right, jobs and money and significant others "happen" for the most part--you can't really make your situation in those areas, you just have to do what feels right and hope for the best, and what other people think of you doesn't matter nearly as much as what you think of yourself.  So, once I came to these conclusions, I really started to worry much less.  The wireless network thing really still ate at me though... but I'm still young so there's plenty of time to get my philosophy down pat.  Once I do, that will really be zen, I think.  Until next time, G
