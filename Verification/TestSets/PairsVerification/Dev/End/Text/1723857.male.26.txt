keys to my place.  My landlord (described by self and others as "eccentric") has already mailed me the keys.   I'm still trying to find someone who wants to drive with me.  2200 miles is a long way to go by myself.  The drive should be really pretty, though.  I'm planning on going through Santa Fe, N.M., Denver, Co., Salt Lake City, Ut., and Boise, Id.  4 days of 10 hours a day, or 3 days of 14 should do it.  Man, that's a lot of driving!
The Jefferson County (Beaumont) commissioners have voted to change the name of one of their county roads. ( urlLink Full story  above) The previous name was "Jap Road." Yes, you read that right. Aside from the fact that it took this long for enough people to care the word is a racial slur, those opposed to the change actually defended it saying it "honored" the Japanese farmer (I sh*t you not) that lived there in 1905. I'm sure that the city of Austin really had to debate hard to decide between "Cesar Chavez Blvd." and "Dirty Spic Lane."  The other thing that bothers me is that they changed the name to recognize a restaurant that was on the road for 30 years that closed recently. Hmmmmmm..."The name honors the Mayumi family patriarch."...How can we change the name and still honor him? Mayumi Road? "Naaahhhh, lets just go in another direction." That just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Like "Jap Road" was OK, but "Mayumi Road" is just  too  "foreign."  Am I crazy?  NOTE: I'm sure the majority of Beamont-ians are nice, well-meaning, educated...well nice and well-meaning anyway. But there seems to be enough that aren't to make this non-story a story, ya know?
Things are getting down and dirty now, gang.  Even though I've known when I would have to leave Austin, it still freaks me out as being too soon.  I think I would feel better if I had a place to live up there.  (BTW, there's some guy has a rather extensive  urlLink photo tour of the Moscow area  if you want to check it out.)  I emailed some folks who are going to help me, but it's still 7am there so I don't expect anything until later.  The other big mind drain right now is buying a car.  Initially, I thought I wanted a  urlLink Toyota Tundra , but I wasn't totally impressed after test driving (it seemed even smaller that I thought it would be).  I also looked at the  urlLink Toyota Highlander  which I thought was pretty OK.  My Dad wants me to look at the  urlLink H0nda Pilot , but they are very popular right now and would probably be out of my price range because the dealers aren't really "dealing."  I also want to test drive those new  urlLink Chevy Colorado / urlLink GMC Canyons , but it seems they are hard to come by.  Hardly anyone withing 200 miles has the model I would want. *sigh*  I wish I had more than 2, check that, 1.5 w
