I didn't sleep well last night and I dreamt all night, both are unusual for me.  God is paving the way for a great school year. He has placed students in my class that don't know the Him and I have a responsibility, no a priveledge, to show them Jesus.  Lord give me strength when I'm weary and give me words when I'm speechless. Give me a heart for all my students everyday, not just the first day. Shine through me, the light of your Son. Thanks for blessing my life with the joy of teaching these young people.
Fellas, this year was as good as any to be at Promise Keepers. What a wonderful ministry to bring more men into a relationship with Jesus. Friday night 1400 men came forward dedicating their lives to the Lord. I only wish that they continue this week to find a local community of believers that can disciple them and follow the rest of the commands given in the New Testament. That they confess the name of Jesus and follow His example in baptism. That they join a local congregation and find their God-given talents to bring more people into His kingdom.   Joe White  was my favorite again. He spoke last year and I didn't think he could top it. He came close this year. He spoke of the Great Physician, the Divine Surgeon, that has given us a new heart. He has given us a new life. Joe gave biblical examples of men that were given new chances, new hearts; Moses, Abraham, David, Zacchaeus, Peter, Paul, Thomas and the thief on the cross. All of these men were given a new heart by God, evident in scripture. Joe showed clips from  Brian's Song, Antoine Fisher, The Passion , and music video by  Jimmy Wayne  entitled "I Love You This Much."     We need to let go of sin because Jesus has already won. He's gained victory over sin and death. Praise God.  Thank you Lord for bringing Joe to PK in Atlanta to speak to us.    Chris Tomlin  was another highlight for me. He led us in song Friday night. What a wonderful and gifted singer/songwriter. He's one of the best out there, in my book. He sang several off his new album that's due out in stores this fall. Check him out if you haven't already. He's part of the  Passion  movement that has been going on for the past five years. One of my favorite songs, one that I could listen to over and over for hours, is his "Holy is the Lord" which is found on  Passion: Sacred Revolution .   Lord, I ask that You make me the man I was intended to be. The man You created me to be. The man who seeks Your will and Your purpose for my life. The dad that protects his children with love and a covering of prayer. The man who loves his wife the way she needs to be loved. Lord give me the guidance through Your scriptures. Fill me up with Y
