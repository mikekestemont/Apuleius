days a weeks at a factory an hours commute from our trailer.  It was a good job for a man who left the rigors of a coal mining family when he was still in middle school.  He quit 8th grade and moved North, out of Southern Kentucky to Columbus Ohio.  Lots of things happened in between him quitting school and ending up raising two kids on his own.  But this isn't his story, it's mine.  He worked hard all week and then played music all weekend.  He played bass, key board and vocals.  Sometimes he was the lead singer and sometimes he wasn't.  Sometimes the bands were rock.  Sometimes country.  Sometimes even Elvis impersonations.  But they played in bars every Friday and Saturday night which meant my brother and I spent more time alone than most kids.  So every Saturday morning, after driving home from his Friday night gig, my dad would practice.  Some people might pour themselves a night cap to relax.  My dad played his guitar.  And because I was ten and everything seemed to center on my dad, I never doubted he would "make it."  Sure I heard him say occasionally that being strapped with three kids was holding him back.  (Yes I said three...I have an older sister but she didn't stay with us long.  And that is her story not mine.)  So as I ate chocolate covered donuts from the bag and watched little blue smurfs on tv (at least everyone told me they were blue, we only had a small black and white) I'd listen to my dad practice.  I guess it was those Saturday morning sessions that imprinted on my mind.  It must have been then I decided to be famous too, just like my dad.  The fact I didn't have any particular talent or skill didn't deter me.  I just KNEW I was gonna "make it."  Twenty-five years later, my dad hasn't made it.  At least not in the way I always imagined he would.  And me, well I am just discovering something my dad must have learned as well.  I'm not famous.  I will never be famous.  I may play my guitar and sing my heart out, but I'm really NOT that good.  And so that makes me what?  Average that's what.  It seems to me that people spend most of their lives trying to "be different."  We want to be special in some way.....and the older we get the way we're special doesn't seem to be as important as getting to be special.  Call me a slow learner.  That it took 35 years for me to figure out, LIFE IS NOT ABOUT ME.  And yet there are these experiences that are significant to me.  It seems a waste to just let them stay dormant inside me, to die with me.  So this "blog" is my way of writing some of these experiences down.  I understand no one will ever read them, not really.  But there is something in the writing.  It seems less wasted, less un-famous.  And so Life And b
