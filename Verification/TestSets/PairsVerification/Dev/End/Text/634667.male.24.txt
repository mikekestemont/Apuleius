of underpants, and suitable embarrassment.  We share a toast with another of our absent friends, who is currently driving a truck-load of people around Equador.  We leave the restaurant, and I manage to embarrass myself by walking across Bristol with a fluffy bunny tail pinned to the back of my shirt. Many photos are taken.  I fall over whilst walking downhill, and because I'm drunk what should have been a simple tumble turns into several forward rolls. Somehow I manage to finish the move back on my feet, which is a display of drunken athleticism completely out of character. I sprain my ankle, so it's not all good.  We're told later in the evening that Maffew will be Best Man (like I said, not a total surprise), and the rest of us will be Ushers. At a French wedding. Should be amusing. Despite the fact that my CV says basic French, the truth of the matter is that I speak French like Derek Trotter. I have a year to brush up.  Getting a taxi at the end of the night is a veritable free-for-all. Nothing cheers up standing around for half an hour like an attractive bunny girl who's lost her ears and can't get home. Sadly, I'd thrown away my fluffy tail when I realised that I'd walked across Bristol as Bunny Boy, and she's going to the opposite side of Bristol to us, so I can't help her on either count.  The following day we have a barbecue and slowly boil in Harmsway's Sun-trap garden. Laetitia discovers that Worcester Sauce and cheese on a salmon grill is not a delicacy.
Feeling things    urlLink  Equilibrium     I was preparing not to like this movie. The 'i'-button on the Sky remote described it as a ' Matrix -style actioner', which always usually means what you're about to see is an hour and a half of dodgy wire-fighting sequences, strung together with a plot you could use to drain pasta. Boy, was I surprised.  It's actually a really good movie. Christian Bale is rapidly becoming an actor I have a lot of respect for (even though I wasn't blown away by  urlLink  American Psycho  ), and I can't wait to see how he handles being Bruce Wayne. The action sequences are original, and anyone who says that the Gun-Kata sucks was obviously disappointed that the film didn't contain more  Matrix -style ridiculousness.  But the real surprise was the story. The idea is an interesting one -- society curbs human emotion in an attempt to stem man's more violent and distructive impulses -- but one you don't believe they'll be able to pull off without any conviction. But they do, and you find yourself immersed in this world. Bale's development from just another one of the emotionless masses to a sense-offender, is excellent, and his struggle to accept his new role in society is well handled. The emotion of many of the scenes stands out all the more because of the stark and restrained backdrop they are set against.  Definitely recommended.  Later . . .
