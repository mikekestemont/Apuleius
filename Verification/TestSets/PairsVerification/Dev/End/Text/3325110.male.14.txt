But then...the police officer ripped off a mask showing that he was...a Republican. You don't want to run into them into dark alley. Fortunately, I was in the police station, not in a dark alley. Unfortunately, it was dark in the police station that wasn't a dark alley. So I say to him "Look! Yet another Middle-Eastern Country to blow to bits and make them free but really under our control!" and I point behind him. Being a Republican, he fell for it. I ran. It was bad, to say the most. But I was desperate. I needed to find an authority. I ran into a Janitor. He asked me if a toilet backed up. I told him that the Republican in the police station was after me, and that he needed a push to the right. Unfortunately, he was a Leftist. He jumped me. I couldn't stop him. He took out a knife conveniently hidden in the toilet. I kicked him, and fled. That made two evil people after me. Then, I met the worst person I could ever meet in person who I knew was evil. Al Gore. He said,"Are you okay? Y'know, I invented being okay!" I ran...again. I was shot by a random person, and died. The Beginning.
I recognized Dean this time! I saw him again today at the allergy place!
Mind you, moose bites can be pretty nasty...
No Really! She was...
A moose once bit my sister...
Including the Majestic Moose.
And many kind, small, furry animals.
The wonderful Telephone system.
See the Lovely Lakes.
Why not try a Holiday in Sweden this year?
Today, I saw Dean at the Temple of Performing arts. He was on lunch break, so he talked w/ violinfreak and I. Since I'm rather the absent-minded, forgetful, and just plain stoopid type, I didn't remember who he was. He reminded me. Needless to say, it was pretty embarrassing.
Today is Father's Day! We celebrated by...um...well, it's the thought that counts, right?
Sunkist and I think it's time people stopped referring to lousy products as lemons. I mean, there's nothing defective about lemons. They're fun, flavorful and packed with vitamin C. Any product should be proud to be called a lemon; they're that good for you. In fact, the next time somebody tells you to go suck a lemon, you tell them, "Hey, thanks for caring about me."     You guys think it'll work?
Hello all. I am posting. Woo-hoo!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Yeah

We hold these lemons to be self evident, that all pies are created tasty.
