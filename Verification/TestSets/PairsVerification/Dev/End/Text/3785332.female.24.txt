including zip code, email address, and website or blog address. This is required information. If you don't include any or all of that information, I will reply to you once asking for what's missing.
urlLink     Feel free to use this button...There'll be a bigger one available next week, and maybe other choices.
The signups for SP III officially kicked off today, and as of right now I have 22 signed up. I was trying to email each person individually, but since it looks like this will be getting "up there" in numbers, to conserve on time I'm simply blogrolling your sites. Please link to the SPIII blog and check the right sidebar 24-48 hours after you email your information to me. If your blog is there, I received your information and added you to the list. If it's not there, send me an reminder.  *Please*, indicate whether or not you do NOT want an international secret pal. If you don't say anything, I will assume that it will be *ok* to set you up with an interntional secret pal!  Also, if anyone knows how to make buttons and wants to design one for SP III, I would really appreciate it! It would be nice for y'all to have a button to put on your blogs or websites showing participation in SP III.   Also, if you could comment on the blog and tell me whether you would prefer to just blogroll this page or if you want a webring, I'm taking votes :-)
If you don't receive yours within the next 24 hours (always assume slow ISPs... happens sometimes), let me know. I did get a few returned, but I figured out the errors and re-sent the email out to those people.   We are currently at 119 participants!
Right now we're sitting at *90* members. If you want a button for SP III it's located below, and a larger one will become available at a later date. I'm so happy this is taking off! We need more international secret pals... I have 56 stating they want to spoil an international pal, but only 16 international pals!   Please doublecheck the right column's blogroll after 2 days to make sure that your blog shows up there. If it doesn't show up email me a reminder! I know there are one blog missing... there are 90 signed up and there are 90 blogs listed but one of those blogs is mine (and I'm not counting myself in the signup list, though I am signed up to spoil someone)... there should be 91 on the blogroll. It is very hard for me to check, because the names of the blogs are not usually even close to the web urls. If you know your blog isn't on the blogroll, please email me ASAP!   I just received an email from an anonymous source asking to be my Secret Pal, that way I don't have to sit out! How awesome is that? Thank you so much!  Happy bloggin' all. I hope this is as much fun for you as it is for m
