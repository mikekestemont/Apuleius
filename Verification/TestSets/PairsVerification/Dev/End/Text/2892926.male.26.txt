going through mail, watching Football, and eventually going to sleep.  Tuesday August 10-210 emails when I came in at 7:30 feeling tired, alcohol withdrawal, and having my shoulder still sore(hopefully that will heal from the second degree burn by Friday)  Any donations from my crazy spending can be sent to me. God knows I need it after spending that kind of cash.
Ah vacationing on the sunny warm beaches of Ft Lauderdale aka Lauddy Dauddy and Miami are that much closer. I am sure the folks down there don't want to see my white ass, but I will tan or burn quickly.  Yesterday was pretty good. Decent work out at the gym, then over to Circuit City to by some DVD's(all of which I got great deals on), then to the liquor store to get my ammo for next week(a bottle of Skyy and a bottle of Jager), then home to unpack and shower. Grabbed some grub and watched "Carlito's Way". Jay and Graham called and hatched up a plan to go to the Tap Room and hang out. Me and Church vs Steve-O and Graham in foos. Matt and I usually lost, but I got in good shots and played good D three quarters of the time. Even Graham gave me some props for stone walling him a couple of times. For those of you that don't know, Graham is pretty good at foos, so when he says you do alright, then you are doing alright. Jen came up and hung out for a bit. It struck midnight and Graham said that since my no drinking was officially over that I should have a drink. I said I didn't need to, but under the duress of peer pressure, I relented and had a shot of Jager/Rumplemintz. We all then decided to move to Wet Willies, or so I thought. I dropped Jen off at her place and then drove by the movie site. Yes, they are doing 2 movies here right now. One is directed by Cameron Crowe and I am not sure about the other one. Went down to Wet Willies and hung out with Jay and Allie. For those in the crew here in town, Joe Cormney is a bartender there. I don't think he remembers anyone, which is good, because I don't feel like talking to him. The scene was very yuppie, GAP, aka Eurotrash. Wasn't jam packed, but there was a good number of people there. I was bored, wasn't my scene, and just was glad when we left. The cops nodded at me when we left the joint. I will say I get less flack from law enforcement when I have a fresh cut. Home and in bed by 3 am  People are welcome over to the crib tonight around 5 to hang out and have a few drinks.  I will be on vacation come Monday and will not be posting or anything via a computer until August 10. I hope everyone has a great week and I will talk to yall when I get h
