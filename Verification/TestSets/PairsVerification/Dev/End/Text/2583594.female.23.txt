wat she did to me. it hurts sooo soo much..anyway, i tried chatting with her decently, for crying out loud, she has been saying sorry to me from Day one!! i guess being nice is all i could do.. we did talk alot.. bout what happened. how could it happened, and it really ruined the frenship. i'll have to admit.. we r totally different.. diff life style. even tho ive once said mean things to her, ( heck i was really pissed at her man) but i guess.. when a person grows up... we tend to learn more things.. and little things like this doesnt matter  anymore. but then again.. its not easy...  guess i was really unlucky to be in love with my ex.. i dono. as much as i wan to forget him, get him out of my system.. its never easy.. and i know it will never be easy.   ive not spoken to him for so long.. and jus few days ago, i went online, he msged me, we chat abit... it was a normal chat, he actually said he misses chatting with me like this.. i guess deep down inside. i do miss him. jus tat i don wanna admit it. anyway.. ironically.. I DREAMT bout him that NIte!!! damn!!!!!!!!!  why cant i jus forget bout him???!?  shheeshh.. really is frustrating...  speaking of frustration.... i always end up liking guys who r already attached!!! are all good guys taken!?!?!?! man.. thats so unfair!!! i did like a guy back home..when i was on my holiday... but too bad he is taken. sad case...  :(  oh gawd...  life.. tats bout it man.  Cheers.!
Lost.. yea, Lost in the ocean filled with lots of ppl.  looking thru the main door of my store... seeing ppl passing by.  Good guys are all gone!!!! they are either Taken.. or.. GAY!! sad, but true.. It's kinda irrtating u know? when i start to like a guy... only to find out that he already has a GF, worst still.. when the Gf herself is a nice person.   arghh.. really is frustrating man.  Anyway, was back in KK, sabah last weekend! HAD a BLASt!!!!  went white water rafting with some old frens!!  had so much fun, drank gallons of water tho, wouldn't even wanna think wats in da water! they should start calling it yellow water rafting, as the water aint white/clear at all! i fell into the "Head hunter" ( yea, there are names for every rapids) along with 2 other guy frens of mine!!! gosh.. it was pretty scary. but u jus need to keep telling urself.. stay calm. don't panic!! the whole trip was fabulous.. will upload some pics soon. but the JOURNEy was HELL!!!!   my WHOle KK trip was sooooo soo packed, i flew midnite flight from KL on thge 1st july, reached KK at bout 2:30, slept at 3am.. woke up at 6am coz we need to get our ass at the pick up point at 7 am! 2 hours bus ride to Beaufort, then.. another 2 hours Train r
