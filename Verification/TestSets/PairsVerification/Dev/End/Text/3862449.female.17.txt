the 18th, Rachel and Samantha helped me get started with my work. He is working on a project to find out if a bunch of stars have a smaller companion stars which are causing them to appear to emit infrared rays (at least i think this is what is going on...i still don't fully understand).To do this, he is using the Spitzer telescope which is one of four large orbiting telescopes which make up a program of NASA. It takes pictures using an infrared camera. I learned how to use Unix and then had to download images taken by the Spitzer telescope of 66 stars to create a library of images. This was kind of tedious work because it takes a long time to enter in the coordinates of each star, but it wasn't bad and I learned a lot, even though i still don't quite understand what is going on. Hopefully things will begin to make more sense soon!
Yesterday was my first day back for a week and a half. It was a little hard getting back into the work routine after vacation. I spent most of the day working on my powerpoint presentation. I am no longer as nervous about giving it  now that I see that i actually do have a lot to talk about. Still....15 minutes is as long time. Today is the undergrad presentation day, so i will probably go to them for most of the day.
On monday i finished organizing the image list for Dr. Baum. She took me out to lunch so i could kind of pick her brain for information about her college experience. She went to harvard and university of maryland, two schools i am very interested in, and was able to give me a good perspective as a student athlete. I am very lucky to have her as a resource. That afternoon, Dr. Richmond gave me some of the data he collected from observing the star that i found to be varying. I made a graph using this data, and it again showed variability throughout the night in the magnitude of the star. Dr. Richomd suspects that this might be due to an issue of color. If this star happens to be a different color star then the other stars around it, the results might be skewed. Dr. Richmond is going to check this soon, so i may know whether or not this star is normal or really a variable star. I won't be back into work until the 11th- vacation time!!!
On thursday, i worked on rearranging the list of images for Dr. Baum. She wants me to put them in order by what kind of filter and instrument was used. Then she wanted me to sum the exposure times and also include that in the list. This is taking me a while to do. I have learned how to alphabetize spreadsheets on excel and how to use the sum function. We had volleyball that afternoon and then i left a little early because I was leaving for ESG's that n
