I'm playing with the Ibanez TS7 Tubescreamer now. It's the first pedal that I really got to try out and it belongs to Sean. (Thanks for lending it to me and Nicholas!) Since no one else is at home, I can safely unleash the awesome power of the overdrive pedal! Muahaha! I hope the noisy construction work downstairs is loud enough so the neighbours won't trace the origin of the generated noise pollution to me alone. Initially I thought it was just to amplify the sound or something to that effect since it's named  'Tubescreamer' . I couldn't tell that the grey pedal was for overdrive effect when I first saw it until I received Sean's SMS. No wonder there was the tiny knob on the top labelled  'Drive' . How silly of me. I've also managed to lay my hands on Dan Brown's  Da Vinci Code  (Finally!) and  Angels and Demons  (The two bestsellers on Life! bestsellers list for the past few months) when I passed by MPH the day before. You won't be hearing from me for the next couple of days.
No wonder I found this song so familiar when Dawn asked me to listen to it on Friday at Gramophone. I heard the punk rock version by New Found Glory somewhere last year when I first discovered them. These lyrics are adapted from the NFG version because Astraweb has yet to post the version by North. I don't think the lyrics should differ much (There's another version by B.B. King and Bette Milder). Nice ballad anyway, go listen.       Tonight it's very clear     As we're both lying here     There's so many things i want to say     I will always love you     I would never leave you alone          Sometimes i just forget     Say things i might regret     It breaks my heart to see you crying     I don't wanna lose you     I could never make it alone     I am a man who will fight for your honor     I'll be the hero you're dreaming of          We'll live forever     Knowing together that we     Did it all for the glory of love          You'll keep me standing tall     You'll help me through it all     I'm always strong when you're beside me     I have always needed you     I could never make it alone     I am a man who will fight for your honor   urlLink      I'll be the hero you've been dreaming of     We'll live forever     Knowing together that we     Did it all for the glory of love          Just like a knight in shining armor     From a long time ago     Just in time i will save the day     Take you to my castle far away     I am a man who will fight for your honor     I'll be the hero you're dreaming of          We're gonna live forever     Knowing together that we     Did it all for the glory of love     We'll live forever     Knowing together that we     Did it all for the glory of love          We did it all for love     We did it all for love     We did it all for love     We did it all for l
