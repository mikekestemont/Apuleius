blog occaisionally that there will not be many people watching. oh well it's still a bit exciting.       Oh and after sleeping on those lines I wrote in my last post, I realized that with a select group of people I know (not family at all, sad but true) I have separation anxiety like a little kid. and that day that i posted one of the people closest to me left and I'm really really really missing them right now. and I will for a long time. because I know that I won't see them ever again in my life. And God only knows if I'll see them in heaven.
the stars tonight remind of tears spilled on a velvety fabric of illusion seamlessly fading with the first sketch of dawn
going to need to take the picture out of my profile &amp; off the blog :(   my neighbor was asking me about blogging, so just in case she found this blog, she wouldn't know it's mine :) yeah i know, i'm easily scared by stuff like that.
I have a fever of 102Â° F and my parents still made me go to church today. At least I was able to take notes to keep myself awake. It was an interesting sermon but I still have a fever so it wasn't like I was completely able to give my whole, undivided,  alert  attention.

Well, it looks like it will be me, my brother, and my parents going to dinner. My sister called from work--she just threw up (my theory is too much sun/lifeguarding in conjunction with dehydration) There's a terror warning in New York (right in the area that I'll be going to in a few days) and my father is really making me angry because he's immediately downsized it. I'm not afraid of it or anything or making a big deal about it/making it into a big deal, but he doesn't think that I'm telling the truth. But look at the headlines. I'm not fucking lying.
