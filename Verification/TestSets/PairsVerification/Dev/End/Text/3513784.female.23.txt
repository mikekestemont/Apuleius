over main deadlines (the big objectives, or any bottleneck issues) rather than action-by-action.....   Btw, no capoeira tonight :(  i guess u didnt get to see the film that u were talking about yesterday?    tchau   alex
I have a new baby, I have a new love! Let me introduce it to you, her name is urlLink  ARTEMISIA !     "ARTEMISIA is a woman´s first name. We imagine the foundation as a person not reduced to a single issue, but as a living, organic being. "She" might sometimes be contradictory, but always passionate, with a human desire to help other to transform their communities.Tha name remins us an institution is made uff of its people: staff members, supporters, fellows, grant recipients ... its structures are created not for their own sakes, but for the fullfillment of the human needs"    Isn´t this beautiful?  Ladies and gentlemen,  urlLink ARTEMISIA  is the foundation I from my AIESEC Regional Coordinator position I work for now! Just look at this values ... aren´t they sexy?     Guys, just go to their webpage, urlLink http://artemisiafoundation.org/novo/ , it´s amazing, all of them are amazing.  I feel so proud of making part of this in a way, talking about expectations ... things that you never expected, finally end of making you happier than anything...it´s just so inspiring! I feel so challenged with the expected outcomes of my job, but rather than this, I´m so hungry of knowledge and this sensitivity of understanding the development world and working between people that throwed everything away to "try to fix this world", there where they think they can start doing it. I´m amazed and I just pray for keep surprised everyday.
Betreff: Explora Programme  Datum: Thu, 5 Aug 2004 17:25:48 +0200 (MEST) Priorität: Normal  Von: "Niki Rohrmoser"     Dear Queen of SSGN Board,  how are you? Are you at the moment in Brazil lying at the Copacapana beach or are you in Colombia lying at the Baranquilla Beach.  Yo apprendo mucho espanol aqui, pero la espanol dominicana es dificil de entender - okay back to English.  I face a lot of challenges here - no electricity, no water, no office with computer and internet except in the office of my traineeship (Horwath Consulting, www.horwath.com, if you are interested in) and the last challenge is now that we lose one MC member - Edmer our VP-ICX.  So I am now taking over his part and I am the new VP-ICX here. Due to the fact that I am didnt get much transition about the explora project, it would be very cool if you can help me. I want to push this initiative but I am lacking information.  So thank you for your help.  Aja except all these challenges the Dominican Republic is great, Merengue, Bachata, Salsa,...... Tropical heat, playas (which I havent seen so far, working in Santo Domingo from Monday till Saturday - you have no time for lying at the beach).  hasta pronto y un abrazo de la Republica Dominicana  Niki  Niki dice - "Soy verdadero un dominicana" (quote of August 2004)  PS. congratulations for your faci s
