great that he's finally coming out of his shell.  Dill is dating some 34 year old college lecturer and her mom wants me to have a word with her and let her know what she's in for and basically tell her it's not such a good idea seeing as I have experience in that area, I told her it wasn't any of my business and it was up to Dill what she does with her life. I haven't really spoken to her since that whole business a while back, she's called me a couple of times but I haven't picked up the phone or returned her calls.  I've been drinking loads recently and I probably shouldn't but its fun and I get to forget the shit that enters my head the other 95% of the time I'm conscious.  I bought some fantastic heels from this place in Newcastle, they were really expensive but totally worth it, it's not often I spend such a ridiculous amount of money on shoes but it's always nice when I do.  I have a bunch of stuff that I need to post to Jenn in Chicago, I've been meaning to send her the stuff for ages but I keep forgetting or thinking that I should wait until I get something else.

She keeps telling me about the honeymoon in Bulgaria like I haven't already heard it a hundred times before but I smile and nod and seem interested to humour her. I might have a couple of drinks with her and then come home and have an early night.   Lately I have mostly been listening to The Pixies and some Live Queen stuff.   I was at my Gramma's house the other day and was looking through a bunch of stuff she had in her loft and look what i found  my bear!  It's about 40 years old, some uncle or nephew or cousin gave it to me when I was a little baby and he was going into the army and he'd had it for 20 years since he was a baby. My gramma says I should pass it on to Liv or someone but I told her to forget that idea i'm keeping it untill I die. I'm s
