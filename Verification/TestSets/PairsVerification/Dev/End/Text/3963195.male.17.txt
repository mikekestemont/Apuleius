raining…………………. If it had not been raining at that time I wouldn’t have been here now to write this story……………………………….
I feel very much bad to go to the college more because of the awkward behavior of my seniors. Some of them are so rough that I could not cope up with them, and some even asked me to give them money… I told them that I don’t have any but then they are not leaving me alone. They told me that I should bring them some money on Monday. I am scared to go on to the College on  Monday.................
Today there was college only till 11.00AM. There was some strike going on at the college so our class teacher came and told us to leave the college immediately…………
New Skoda L&K came on Thursday night. Then next day morning achha and I went to the temple with the new car on Friday morning. And we all went to Trivandrum after that…………….
Today was not at all a lucky day for me. We were late for the college today. And I had a short ragging by the seniors. I was very lucky to get out of it without a scratch and after the college was dispersed at 1. Pm I was stopped by some of my seniors and was forced to give them money. And they even told me to give some money again on Friday………….Ohhhhhhh god I think I will take a leave on Friday!!!!!!!!!!!!
Today I went to the college at about 9.30AM with one of my friend in my car. The fear of getting caught by the seniors for ragging was in me…but then due to my luck or some other reasons there was no one near the gates of the college. We went inside and found out our classroom, there was a big rush near the classroom…Parents of the students who are going to join there were waiting anxiously. Soon we got into class and a substitute teacher came in for taking the attendance…when the attendance was nearly over a group of SFI some sort of group or party formed by the students of India came shouting to the class. Everyone including the teachers was a bit shock to see this…but then they just went along with their stuffs and we went along with ours…the class was over within an hour. When we came out of the college, both sides of the national highway roads in front of the college was filled with armed police men’s and armored vans and there were large pieces of stone lying here and there too on the road… some fight with students might have taken place…………seeing that it was not any more safe to stay there we fled from the site…………………….																							The daily classes will be held from tomorrow onwards!!!!!
Tomorrow I am going to join my new college. I am very much scared to go!!!!!!!!!!!!  Ragging by the seniors is the main reason. I have never ever experienced any kind of ragging in my school days nor outside. This will be my first experience if a
