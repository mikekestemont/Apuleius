driveway.”  “You sound like it’s pissing you off.”  “It is...and it isn’t. Lord knows I’m glad Stephi stopped being a silly-assed tart and settled herself down, and I hope it lasts, I really hope it does. I hope she’s got some substance to her, not all shallow like her father. Boy, he was a piece of work. Worked like a slave just so he could have the latest whatever-car, tape deck, tennis racket, motorcycle, you name it. That’s how he always measured his success in real estate-by how much he had. At first he loved me because I was so simple; earthy was his term. Fifteen years later it was the very thing he couldn’t deal with. I didn’t want any of his junk, I wasn’t impressed with it. Said I was so behind the times. The smartest two things I did in my life was let him buy this place for me and letting him skip off to California with his vapid little secretary Tina Big Tits."   “Tina Big Tits...she sounds like a blow-up doll.”  “She was. And she did anything he said. He needed a woman like that, some gum-chewing, salad-eating bubble-head to do his bidding and his laundry. He used to like me because I sassed him. Then that changed and he had to get some from somewhere else.   “It didn’t bother you he was cheating on you?”  “Of course it did. He was my husband after all. I did love him in some twisted way. He was a liar and a cheap hustler, but he didn't start that way. That’s why I didn’t give him a hassel about a divorce. I told him to do what he wanted as long as he signed the bar over to me. He couldn’t handle his liquor anyway.” I nodded as she stubbed out her cigarette and gulped down the last of her wine. Lady Day was a cool jazz melody that simply didn’t end, she just hung in the air like cigarette smoke.
I didn't know what a blog was until 10 minutes ago. Dom P stopped by, and he was on me about turning one of my sceenplays into an actual film. We agreed that this was the era of the DYI; anyone that gotten anywhere in the last 10 years, started out selling out the trunk.   Dom tlls me a blog is a kind of journal, where you can rant and rave and cats respond to it...  No Kidding.   He tries to tell me about some dude, out on Frisco, that's supposed to have a blog...I look up two names, but get nothing.   Wayne Chung...  That's the name, no kidding.   The site comes up and he shows me what's what.   How about that.   A little backround on Myron X; I'm a former DJ, redord producer magazine contributor, movie critic, screenwriter and a staff writer for a children's TV show...I've averaged a job about every three years for the last twelve years. I currently reside in Washington D.C. with my wife Nettie and our two kids...  More about that l
