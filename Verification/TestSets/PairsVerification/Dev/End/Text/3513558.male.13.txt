and say sorry.
Yeah, got quite freaked up today. Knew this thing through zhiway. Thanks.   I gotta snooze for some time before i can do something. Darn freak. let'S see, oh well. Managed to mend up all my... sigh... Dad got pissed with me for dunno what reason. Drunk? i dunno lar. Twisted my head like sh!t. He talked with me, ever so happy, that ever so round tummy, ever so funny. Alright.    Went to school, quite happy. I gotta into IB i think coz my average went past the required cut-off: 70. I gotta 74.9, yea, that'S quite umm.. alright. Back to the point. Umm.. alright, the bus to the Jap school, Meitoku, didn't have e freaked up space for me. What, discriminate the Singa from the anonehs issit? loL, i asked someone to get her (yes, her, really got no space) bag away and she moved lohz.    Saiz. and, well, first period: English. bleak, got nothing to say. Boring old crap on present tense.   Jap came next and oso no prob lar. Grammar was, alright. Won't be in the test. didn't bother about it. ahaha  The recess time i spent it with the sec 3s. Ah, Dumb fark, i got striked out thrice by them. BASTERD! WTF! All the sec 1s all looking at me. Strike out. Basterd. The wind make the ball curve (they use tennis ball in case the glass windows will crack and make some fuss if the real leather baseball is used) becoz the ball is so fuking light. hell...   3rd period was English yet again. yea, that tall "model"istic teacher come and buzz around for some crap and sent a student out for no reason. wtf, thank god Ms. Frank (i dunno what) coming to teach next lesson.   bio came straight after that. well, it's a free period. but he asked me to tuck in my shirt. whatever. This was the turning point of my life in Meitoku.   I fooled and bitched around like a stupid kid in the nearby block. I asked a girl to shut up. can you believe? a girl, jap girl with that whatsoever comment you wanna make whether she is chio or not. I dun care whether she's chio. You think i want her? but hey, at least make a good impression to them that the student from Singapore is like a good one? not a person who asks people to fuk off and whatsoever. argh. The next period i decided to keep quiet. yea. sort of worked.   Nothing much. PLayed golf, baseball (vented my triple strike out). The ball sort of went out of shape. Dad could like hit those 120km/h balls i pitched. wow, i thought he was the kind of person with the ever so round tummy, ever so.... okiez, i am lame. LoLz. nothing much, gota sleep. TV was fun loL. familiar with "bACK TO SCHOOL?" yea, that was funny. haha.   Nightz... Muackz  Thought of the day: If that's your limit, do the best out of that limit, and your performance will be beyond that l
