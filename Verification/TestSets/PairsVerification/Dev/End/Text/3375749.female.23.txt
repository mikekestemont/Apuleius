to come, but I really want to go to the beach. I need a new beach pass anyhow. Plus I like to go to New Smyrna Beach and look at some of the surf shops they have. Well, nothing else exciting to write about at the moment. I'm going to get my bathing suit on and head out. Have a great day!!
Before my dad moved in with us in January he had called to say that when he got here he had something very important to tell me and my sister. I thought nothing of it at the time. About 2 weeks after he had moved in he finally sat us both down in the kitchen and said, "You two have another sister." I just stared back at him while the thought registered in my head. He then went on to tell us the story of how she came about and why he hadn't told us sooner. Something about her mother made him sign all his rights away to her when she was 3 and he thought that since he had done that, that he wasn't supposed to say anything about her anymore. He didn't want to cause trouble. (A little far-fetched if you ask me, but I didn't pursue it.) So apparently Ashlee (that's her) has known about Erin and me since she was born. As she's been getting older, she's been trying to get in touch with us. That's why Dad finally told us about her. He basically had to. So Ashlee is 15 now. 15 years have gone by that I can't get back. See I wasn't mad that he had had another child with another woman. That's his business. He's a grown man and can do whatever he wants as long as he still does his "Dad" duties for Erin and I. I was just upset that this had been held from us. Like we didn't deserve to know. Well shortly after he told us about her, he went up to Georgia to visit her. He brought back pictures of her and stuff. I got her email address and I've emailed her a couple times, but it's not the same. She feels like a distant friend rather than my sister. And for that I am resentful. A bond with a sister is something that no one can replace. Lord knows Erin and I have our moments when we get on eachothers last nerve (which is normal), but having her in my life makes everything better. She's the one I could talk to about anything, for we've been through everything together. And I wish that Ashlee could have been a part of that too. But I'm hoping that maybe this summer she will get to come down and visit and we can kind of get to know one another. It will be strange but I think it will be cool at the same time. I'm not really sure how I got on this topic, but I feel much better typing out all my thoughts about the whole t
