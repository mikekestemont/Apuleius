interesting and brand new things are introduced and they firmly gripped the imaginations of many readers. But the movie just simply BRIEFLY introduced them. The Knight Bus, for example, take up one chapter in the book. However, the knight bus make an appearance of less than 5 minutes in the show. What really sadden me was the fact that the director left out the whole Quidditch competition. This year, Gryffindor won the Qudditch Cup. But the movie didn't even show it! The part where Harry thinks that Black is out to kill him till where he get to know that Black is his godfather and Peter Pettigrew is the real traitor is so summarised that it is unbelievable. Since when do you help a person that you think is out to kill you to stun a teacher using magic who may save you? In the story, the fact that Black is Harry's godfather was slowly revealed to Harry. But the director does it in one scene. Futhermore, the wonderful past of James Potter, Remus Lupin, Sirius Black and Peter Pettigrew was left out. The never known past of Snape with the four was also left out. Lastly is the origins of the Marauder's Map. People who never read the book but saw the movie will never know that the Map was invented by the four. Doesn't anyone realised something is amiss when Snape can't figure out the secret of the Map while Lupin can in the movie? After all, Harry never told anyone how to activate the Map the correct way, not even Lupin...   I am too disgusted to go on. Luckily, the 4th movie is directly by another director. But one thing give me some pleasure. Emma Watson or Hermione Granger. She sure has matured in all ways. Wow, she has become more beautiful and her dressing is now more fashion conscious. Look at what she wear during the first screening at London! Her looks really enchanted me...hee hee. She not only grown physically but mentally. During press conferences, questions posed to her was answered very carefully and well, like those Hollywood artists. One day, if she venture into show business, she is sure to be a megastar, like Julia Roberts.
