know how you tick, I see your routine. Remember beauty will fade. Try to be as beautiful inside as you are out. You will go far in this material world, of material people. You will use many more for your purposes. You will break many more hearts. New lesson, never be to good to anyone. In the end you will be taken for granted. I am not something you amuse yourself with. I am not a toy. I am not a slave. I am a man. A man who once loved you so much he built his world around you.
Tunnel vision. All you see is the goal you set for yourself. You are selfish, disrespectful, arrogant, naive, insensitive. Why can't I do to you what you do to me? oh yeah... I forgot... It's a matter of principle. Damn me and what I believe in. Damn me for being a nice guy. Why couldnt I have found someone who deserves all I have to give.
You look your best when you're asleep. You ask why I love you? I love you coz you're delicate when your eyes are closed. Innocent when your lips smile. You look child-like when you breath easy. I love you coz I know you dream of big things. I know you'll wake to reality, make the best of the day, and make someone else's day more livable. I love you coz I know you are interesting, full of wonder. I love you coz you have principle and character. You take risks and you do what you set your heart to. I love you coz I want to love you.   I just don't understand what i did to be shut out of your world. I love you but sooner or later, I won't be anyone but that someone who loves you. I wont be the person you laugh with. The person you get in trouble with. I won't be the person you see when you think back and remember. I love you, but I dunno if you really love me too.
Oh to love unconditionally. To give and expect nothing in return. For god so loved the world he gave his only son to die on the cross for the sins of the very beings he created called men. I had no idea how difficult loving someone could be. I'm not just saying liking someone's company. Enjoying meaningful conversations on trivial issues. Sharing dinner and a movie. Not the typical stereotype "we have an understanding" love. But to be truly madly deeply in love with someone to the point that your whole world revolves around them.   It's sad how the very person you gave your world to could tear your world apart. It's the usual yin yang. The capacity to be the total opposite of anything. That one person who can make you smile can leave you in tears. Whoever can brighten your day can rain on your parade. You finally find someone to give your life meaning only to end up right where you started... Alone, confused, broken, u
