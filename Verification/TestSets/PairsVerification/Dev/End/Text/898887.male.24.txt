mention a killer attic.  The basement (as we know I don't like basements) is creepy and reminds me of something you would find in The Village time period.  But all in all I am in love with the house.  And for a whopping $340,000 I should be.  Again, not paying for it no need to complain.  But now I'm off to bed I have been up since 8pm Saturday night and it is now Monday 1:55 a.m.  But, I want to leave you with an email I received tonight from someone I have never met, heard from, but now appreciate due to the following:  Paul,  I have been a reader of your blog for sometime now.  Not really sure how I got there originally as I often surf through blogs via links on other blogs.  Yours really touched me in a very personal way as I could see much of myself and my searching and confusion when I was much younger.  Happily, I am in a much better place now than I was back then, or as I suspect the you are often in now.  Anyway, I will be sorry not to be able to read your blog anymore.  I understand your need for more privacy and, as a stranger to you, I have no right to intrude on that privacy.   If I may make an unsolicited comment...I want you to know that things are not always as dark, or even as confusing, as they seem sometimes.  I consider myself to be a sensitive and creative individual, as I sense that you are, and as such I have often intensified reality (if you can understand my meaning) and over analyzed things.  We are the type of people who feel things so deeply that we paint or otherwise create them and write them from the very depth of our souls.  Love eludes us or, as I have discovered in my journey, it appears to elude us and it throws us into a dark and empty space from which we struggle to find our way back.  When we love, we love from such a place in our very souls that few ever feel or understand.  And we often pin everything on that love.  Sometimes even our very existence.  With age and experience and the love/support/understanding of some special people I have learned to understand my special and unique nature and to live more harmoniously with who/what I am.   Enough intensity.  I have a tendency to ramble on if so allowed.  I would just like you to know that I have appreciated your wit and have sympathized with you when you have bared your soul.  If you don't mind that a total stranger looks in on you once in awhile, I would appreciate and value your new blog address.  If you do mind, I am totally understanding.  Blog On!  O.J.  Is this not the sweetest email?  I haven't received something so positive in a long time.  It makes all the times I have pressed the Publish Post button all the more rewarding.  Night A
