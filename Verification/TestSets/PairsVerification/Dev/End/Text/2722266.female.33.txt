a half, Pak is 5 and a half."  Boy pauses and thinks. "Are they twins?"   ----  Epilogue: Next time the boy walks up, Kori starts to ask him some questions for a change. Turns out his name is Gabriel. His brother's name is Adrian.  Chien asks, "He's a boy. Why's he named Adrienne?"  ----  Moral of the story: If you don't like answering questions, don't have any kids.
559ers! Here's the latest!  For this Friday (August 6th) PLEASE READ 1 Corinthians Chapter 2.  (It's not too long. You can do it in one sitting!)  Last Friday we talked about 1 Cor. 1 and enjoyed some great discussion.  Bring questions, points of interest, or any other thoughts that relate to the text that you'd like to discuss.  We might even discuss points that  don't  relate to the text, if they seem to be of great enough import!  Here are the prayer requests from Friday, for those of you who like to be reminded throughout the week:  A- praise that God has provided guidance and answers,  as she'll be staying in Ohio! Also, pray for driving safety- she'll be travelling back to N.C. this week.  C- Continued prayer for the job search.  S- Brother's oldest son in Maine needs prayer.  Also pray for family friend's divorce.  K- praise for nephew! He got his tongue clipped and should be able to function better now!  K&J- child custody issues need lots of prayer.  Also pray about the house showings, as time is dwindling.   Praise- K's brother, the police sergeant, came out of the car chase/shooting unscathed!  A- been feeling overwhelmed!  Pray for peace, for rest, and for her to worry less!  L- girl with brain tumor (Jennifer)- pray for recovery, and for the remaining part of the tumor to be healed.  A- Cousin really needs Christ.  B- Praise & Prayer- guidance as he continues seeking where it is that God wants him.  Please also pray for Jay & Debi (and ashton and spencer) as they travel this week.  We'll miss them for the next 2 weeks!  Also, continue to keep Troy in your prayers.  If I hear anything about how he's doing or where he is now, I'll let you know.  Anything else? hmm... we miss John and Kori and the kiddos lots. If you haven't done it already, go to the previous post and read John's note-  ..  :)  That's all. See ya Friday. Read 1 Corinth. 2 !  Catch ya on the flip side!
Hey.  John here.  Just wanted to say 'thanks' to all of you for being such an important part of our life. And 'Thanks' specifically for the kind gifts you gave to Kori and I on our last night at Emerge.  We think about you all, and pray for you all.  And you're all welcome to stop by our house whenever. Same goes for my office.  We'll stop back into 559 and Emerge periodically. We care about all of you, and are confident that the ministry will grow as you continue down the path you're on.  Good work!  Thanks a million,  J
