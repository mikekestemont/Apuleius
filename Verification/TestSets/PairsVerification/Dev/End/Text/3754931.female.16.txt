players with a low combat level should be very cautious or they could come to a sudden and sticky end at the hands of trolls.  This update introduces the town of Burthorpe and a troll area, which is an area that we have plans to expand in future updates with some quests classed in the experienced quests bracket.  We have made some adjustments to the agility arena. More than one person can now go over the low wall at once and it doesn't take as long to use the handholds.  Some colourblind people were struggling with the new strange boxes due to them being fairly transparent, therefore they are now no longer transparent.  Taken from  urlLink www.runescape.com
Today regular visitors to our website might notice that we have massively overhauled the front page! We know some of you might be used to our old layout, but we think that once you are used to the new design you will agree that it is easier to navigate. We have tried to make the front-page make better use of the available screen space, as well as making the most accessed areas (for example the worldmap) easier and quicker to get to.  The layout of the manual has also been improved, and lots of new information has been added, including a few new sections for you to discover yourselves!  You will also be glad to know we have added an all new exclusive wallpaper to our extra files section, which has moved towards the bottom of the main menu.  Finally, Mozilla Firefox 0.9 users will be pleased to know that we have improved compatibility with that browser, so you will now be able to login to the secure section of the site with less hassle than before.

We have had to move worlds 19,20,21 and 25 to a different location, because the company that was providing bandwidth for them previously has suddenly ceased trading. This meant we had to arrange an alternative at very short notice.  So we could get them up and running again as quickly as possible, those worlds have now been moved to one of our other existing providers.  Their new home is 'nlayer'. We already had a few worlds there and were very happy with their reliability/performance, so in fact the relocated worlds should hopefully run faster than ever at their new location.  All the worlds should now be functioning normally again.  *Taken from  urlLink www.runescape.com
We've had to temporarily take our CET worlds offline to move them to a new bandwidth provider.  Unfortunately our old bandwidth provider for those worlds has suddenly ceased trading, and so we've had to arrange an alternative at very short notice.  The worlds are being moved across now, to a different cabinet in the same building, and should hopefully be back up in a few hours time.  Meanwhile you can keep playing anyway, please just use another world, and I'll post again as soon as they are back.  Thanks Andrew  *Taken From  urlLink www.runescape.com   This does indeed suck.
