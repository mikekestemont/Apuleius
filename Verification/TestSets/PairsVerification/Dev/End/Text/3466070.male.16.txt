a journal once school starts. Seems better then stories.
Yup... Today is August 1st... I don't wanna go back to school yet. Summer wasn't long enough for my taste! Fucken summer school. Took my whole damn vacation! Today I gotta go in and do all the gay shit like pay for a locker that I will probably use once. Only thing I am looking forward to is hangin with Sarah at school and wrestling. Nothing else seems to really appeal to me. Well maybe orchestra. I'll think about that one.
Today Sarah and I saw The Village. It was not what it was cut out to be... At all! It was a good movie, but I just wasn't satisfied with it... You know. They made it sound really good when it was not the best M. Night movie. What else can I say?
Well lately I have been hearing a lot about suicide from a lot of people(especially from the punk and emo kids). They all seem to act like they have it so bad with all there issues with there parents and there painstaking lives in there $100,000 houses. I mean really! You don't even have it bad. Just because your peeps caught you beaten your monkey doesn't mean you have to kill yourself. Then the next problem is how they do it and what happens after. They always cut there wrists and may I say those are always scratches if I ever saw one. Then they turn around and brag about how depressed they are and show off there wounds like there were some kind of new fashion. Really! Wow that is soooo cool... Not! If you really want to die then you would realize you are trying to end your suffering... Then why would you go through the pain of bleeding to death from a slit in your arm? If you really are gonna kill yourself, then shoot yourself in the head. There you will die quick and easy... Just like you wanted. Really you should look at it like Sarah does... "Be glad you are even alive!". Every individual has some kinda special characteristic that makes them special. Take this advise and do what you will with it... Don't kill your self! Finally I said it. lol.
Yup... She is an awesome chick. She can smoke a bong, role a blunt and still have time to go to a hemp fest. That is a busy schedule. Oh yeah... My moms says she loves you Vader. Take care girl.
I am working for a man named Rob who owns a restoration clinic for cars like old mustangs. We restore all kinds of cars. I worked for him in the past, but he did some dirty business with my parents(charged them for a bad job twice) so I quite and now they are closing down. I get paid $15 bucks for 3 hours of work. Not bad, but I still get to finish up some of the old projects I never got to finish. It was pretty fun, but Taco Bell will pay b
