and a bowl of queso. I have a family who likes to have a good time, and we usually always do. I am sure that I will talk about my family a lot on this thing. Some of the funniest things happen when my family is together.  My second passion is politics. I am a liberal. I have been for as long as I can remember. When I was in the 3rd grade I was the only person in my class who voted for Michael Dukakis in our mock election. I have no idea where my politics came from. I come from a family of Republicans. I get a lot of crap for it, but I realize that when it comes to politics, I believe in my heart what I believe in my head. That being said, I can never be wrong when I follow my conscience. I hope a lot of people feel that way about their social views. When I was in the second grade I wrote a paper about being President when I grow up, and that goal has never really change...but, I have become more practical. I don't want to rule the world, but I would like to work in politics. I always called myself a Democrat. I am further to the left than most Democrats, but I won't be voting for Ralph Nader anytime soon. GW and his goons scare the crap out of me, so I am willing to donate my time and money to getting him out of office. If you return or continue to read, you will see a lot about my political views, so I won't continue to ramble on the subject.  My final passion is Longhorn sports. I don't take bad mouthing or losses well. I have been known to cry after a loss (and a few beers). I am very superstitious. I have several shirts, pairs of underwear and hats I can no longer wear because I wore them during a loss. I once stood on the same tile in a kitchen for 3 quarters of a UT football game because my Horns got the lead back when I started standing there taking shots with a friend. I will lay down on the couch when the Horns have the ball and stand up when the Horns are on defense if I think it works. When I go to games, I am a bit more subtle, but I would lay down in the stands if I thought it would help the Horns win a game. Anyway, I am apprehensive about the start of the College Football season, and I am still licking my wounds after the loss at the CWS. Regardless, I bleed burnt orange.  You've just read more about me than I am sure you wanted to know. If you are still reading, get a hobby. Nothing I said above was very interesting, and I think you could have spent the last several minutes doing something more productive. That being said, I hope you come back and read again. :
