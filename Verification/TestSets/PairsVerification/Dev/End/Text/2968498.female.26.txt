I wouldn't know how to write this =) But I remember I did tell myself when I gave him the address that I will not withhold my thoughts no matter what. Hummm... really now...  What I want to say is that I am getting too dependant on him and it's getting really unhealthy. Every night I would come back home and expect him to be with me. If there is something that went wrong, he would be the first person I run to, even on tiny little things. Whenever he is not around, I feel a little lost. Which is so scary.  Did I tell you I told him about how I feel towards him in an email and he went speechless? My thought would be he was not able to feel the same for me. Sometimes I don't really understand what is being withheld. I think it's because they are happy with where they are or they are expecting something better, which I believe the latter applies more. Which is a bit... sad, actually.  I always tell people I am desperate seeking. And I would sit down and laugh to myself, how desperate a person could be being single for more than 2 years already =) But I really am. Just a moment ago I saw Winston. And I was thinking, you sure you want to lead him on? No... I don't want to be with him actually. Something that I learnt from Stanley, you just can't simply settle with anyone. If you want somebody, make sure you are satisfied with it and no regretting. That is like so difficult. Alien would love to call me picky, picky, picky, now that he is getting married. Damn!  I feel lonely. But it's okay. Just go watch your porns, and you would be okay =)
Loreal Lawyer Loreal Lawyer... I remembered that clearly.  Finally managed to see Kin San. He looked really tired and stressed out. And he looks really really tired. He looked so much older now. He cut his hair. Hummm... doesn't look as good as before... I don't know.  My feelings for him is just not there anymore. Probably didn't see him for too long of a time. I asked him, so what finally determined you to come over to see me, he just said, aaahhhh.... nothing, just didn't see you already for long enough of a time, some 1 year already. 1 year already? Wow. Even the hug was so feelingless. Sad.  Patrick... I want to say something about Patrick but... I don't know. Remembered the time, we were in Tesco, and there was this girl we saw that he cared so much. And I just fell for that! He is really one bad tempered person, but really gentle. He was just nagging me the other day that I have to take care of my physical health and I was like okay okay okay... and he said what okay okay, girl it's your health and you don't even care. He is so cute at times.  And there is S
