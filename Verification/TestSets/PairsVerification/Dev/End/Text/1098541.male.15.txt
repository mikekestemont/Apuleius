The age 15 seems to have alota bad things associated with it for everyones lives.  Its really amazing.  One year.  Chaos. Complete chaos.  And I seem to be making a nice chapter for myself for this year currently havent I?  I mean, just this summer i fell in a severe state of love, lost 2 best guy friends, learned that  wheaton is a brick wall when it comes to emotions, Maryland, etc....So I feel the worst ever.  The thing is, i went to my open house, saw an awesome friend whom gave me a hug, and i put on a fake smile told her i fell in love and am in a relationship.  I mean no use trying to mope around a good friend.  so i didnt tell her it all but then i was happy to be seeing thoyre(tech teacher), so i really wasnt too down.  How could i not be happy i saw alotta people i knew and liked alot. and went and said hi to the teachers of yesteryear.  Amazing how such small things can break your whole life apart.  Well the thing that broke me today was melody being in a bad mood and hit me hard about my girlfriend.  She just doesnt have the patience for people like her.  I think it was all down to anger and she migiht nto have ment it.    Heres hoping.          Its just our family is so close that to hear it from one of us isnt good.  whats worse is shes related by the blood so its worse.  I'm ok now guys.  Just remember: if you havent been through the age that is 15 AKA HELL, WATCH OUT.  It'll kick you around, but remember most of the adult population has been through it  cheers
all i really need is a hug from someone outside the immediate family and i cant do that right now. tis lovely to talk to people for late night, but school call soon, and i wont be able to do it. not to mention i dont get to use this laptop for a while.  i hope to get my own soon.  Id like to thank everyone that listened to my problems lately, and apologize for giving them so much of my stress, i apologize but sometimes i need to vent.  THANK YOU
Just saw "Fiddler on the Roof" by Susannah's sisters play company.  It was awesome.  I loved it.  Will probably see it again next weekend with dad.  They all did a wonderful j
