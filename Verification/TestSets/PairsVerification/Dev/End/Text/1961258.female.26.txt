to be able to say .. my waist is 28", and not have to put a clause there and say .. oh yeah, but only at my natural waist (the smallest point of your torso). One does not wear pants there, and if it goes by where you wear your hip huggers then I think my 'waist' would be 42". That's how big my hips are.  Something has to be done. I've been on a drastic kinda diet for the past few days, but have not been able to cut out the junk totally (in moderation) .. but I am proud of my ability to eat small meals. Today I'm going cold turkey, I hope .. just a liquid diet. Or replace most meals & snacks with protein shakes. And working out. I've read that most Hollywood moms lose about 50 - 75lbs in 2 - 3 months, by working out up to 3 hours a day (2 hours cardio, 1 hour weights) and eating next to nothing. So it's not impossible. I'm going for 1 hour cardio today and all this week, then stepping it up the next week.   I'll swim a lot during my vacation and see whether I've still 'got it'. I don't even think I can do 1,000m .. much less 10,000+ that I used to do. But if I do, and since I will have swimsuits I'll go swim as much as I can after the trip. I loved it, and like travelling .. miss it horribly.
It's odd but my body .. composition, if you can call it that .. is changing. I feel better about myself even though the scale does not really reflect it. It's stagnant some days, dips below some days. But I feel better in my clothing, feel better overall and like how I look. I could be fooling myself, for all I know .. but there's nothing wrong with keeping to the light workout schedule I have (swim 3x a week, 1 hour program) and nothing else. I think I need to step it up eventually but it's only been a week or two.  The Xenical is working .. not in the weight loss manner but .. the 'side-effects'. They're not too bad since I don't eat that much fat - at least I know that I haven't been that bad, and the food I eat although in somewhat large quantities is not high in fat. So I know what I need to work on. It's a great panic button thingy .. exactly what I need when/if I gorge myself - instead of laxatives, which I admit I took when I ate a humongous meal like 2 - 3 slices of pizza.  I'm not sure if what I eat is a lot. If what I think of as a huge serving is actually a normal serving? And then I label the day as BAD and go off and make things worse by saying the day's spoilt so what the heck.  Not much junk food at all lately. Am happy about t
