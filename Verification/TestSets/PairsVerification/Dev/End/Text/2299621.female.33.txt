to the creek to take a bath, protesting squawks of chickens and chicks, the dull whack-whack of firewood being chopped... The sound and scent of mornings...    "Jai guru deva om Nothing’s gonna change my world Nothing’s gonna change my world Nothing’s gonna change my world Nothing’s gonna change my world..."    a day in May, 2004  It is hot. The craftstore is cool, a welcome respite from the heatwave that lies oppressively over  Khon Kaen. Sorting through some woven clothing material. Smiling at the tourist shirts with the cute water buffaloes print. A girl comes to me, her eyes smiling, offering me a green dinosaur. A sauropod, a  Brachiosaurus . I smiled back at her and took the dinosaur home with me.
Really, at two o'clock in the morning (2:25 a.m. to be exact) what interesting things could I possibly write about?    after two minutes of introspection   Hmm. I think I have a very boring life. Interesting things happened to me 10 or 12 years ago. But I couldn't remember what they were. Ah yes. A very interesting, life-altering thing happened to me last summer. I should be grateful.  Yes, I am grateful . I fell in love.  I remember when I was younger, I was in college, I used to wake up at one o'clock in the morning and go outside of our house and look at the sky. Nothing interesting really, just a weird way of trying to get back to sleep. I used to bring my diary out with me, just in case something brilliant and witty gets written by me. Nothing ever did. All I had to show for the nocturnal mind forages were a couple of doodles which weren't  that  good in the first place.  I also remember falling in love, twelve summers ago. He had beautiful teeth.   I remember losing my belief in the concept of God at age 15.   I remember my grandmother telling me nonsense things about suns and clouds. They are nonsense now. But when one is 5 years old and don't know any better, everything that a grandmother holds to be true, make sense.  I remember trying to add three and five, when I was 4 years old. That was a traumatic experience. I am still trying to block it out of my memory. In consolation, I have had the highest possible grades in Integral Calculus and Advance Algebra when I got older.  I remember riding a train at age 3 because I was such a bratty papa's girl and he had to bring me with him during his travels because my mother can't stand my tantrums which will last for 8 hours.  I don't remember much before that. But my mother certainly remembered what a difficult child I was.   Well, I'm going to bed now.
...and I really have nothing edgy or witty or sarcastic or even funny to post. I am, simply, quite surprisingly, just happy. It is not my normal mode, the happy mode. My normal mode is grouchy, sarcastic or grim. Rarely happy.  Damn. This world is so fuckingly g
