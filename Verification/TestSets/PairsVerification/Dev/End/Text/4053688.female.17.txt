first few seasons with Prue and Andy (from the first season). Which makes me realize that in a few years when Tru Calling is going to be gone, I will probably miss that show too. Now, I wished that I had recorded episodes of Roswell... because I've seen most of the first season. When I'm reading the transcripts, I remember the scenes. If I recorded Tru Calling, I wouldn't miss it in the future.  All I have left is everything I remember, that and a few episodes of Charmed that I recorded some years ago.
