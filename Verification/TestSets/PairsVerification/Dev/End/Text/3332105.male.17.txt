even though I don't know exactly what we are going to do, but that's okay because apparently she has something to talk to me about, and I have quite a bit to talk to her about, so the location probably won't matter that much. I really REALLY regret everything that I did with Sarah because of that though, because it seems she really wanted to be with me and I let that pass by to be involved in a relationship that didn't amount to much of anything, despite multiple promises of such... I always do that, though; if there is no hope, I will hang on the fantasy of a possibility, and if I do have a chance at something, I move on and don't pursue it, because I don't think I have that opportunity. Well, I know everything will work out fine, one way or the other, I just wish I could slow down the way I'm living life a little, everything is going so fast. I know it sounds really horrible, but Kris seems a little unhappy with her current boyfriend, so maybe that won't work out and maybe I didn't lose an opportunity for quite possibly the greatest thing that could ever happen to me... I mean, if she is happy with this guy, I REALLY don't want them to break up, I'm just saying, maybe if she ISN'T happy, then I might get another chance at what I've been dreaming of since not long after I met her, as long as I'm not stupid and blow it like I always seem to do. I just want so badly to be in her arms, to comfort her every anxiety, and get the same back, because that would be all it would take to do so; a simple hug from her just makes everything perfect again... well, I guess at the moment I just have to take things as they come, because I can't tell the future and I can't rush things, not that I necessarily want to do either. All I want is a second chance, even if I really don't deserve it, because I really think we could be happy together, and I really think I could make her happy.  Well, as good as it feels to get so much off of my chest, I really must go. I know I got REALLY personal here, but that is what a journal is for, and I have nothing to hide, and I really couldn't care less what people think of me, with the exception of a few, and none of them will think any less of me just because I am stating me thoughts. Besides, I think it's bound to get even worse, so I shouldn't start apologizing now. I'll post if anything exciting happens pertaining anything I have talked about way up there in that giant pile of words, and probably 15 times in between just to say how I'm feeling, because I tend to do that. Well, byebye, I'm tired of typing and I must g
