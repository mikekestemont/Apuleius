childhoods we always had them around.  I had various beagles, a collie, and a coonhound.  She had various large-breeds.  We both miss having a dog.  Now that we're settling down into a home of our own, we want a dog.  So we went to our local humane society.  We wanted a beagle, preferably a young one, with no history of violence or abuse.  We found one that looked almost perfect.  1.5 years old, spayed female, doesn't like being left alone.  There were two 'issues' noted on her paperwork.  First, she barks at then hides from strangers.  Second, she freezes if you steal food from her bowl while she eats.  However, she'd never bitten anyone in her life.  In fact, in the various stages of provocation the Humane Society used to test her (everything short of beating her), she never even growled.  To us, that seemed to indicate a very good-natured animal, exactly the kind we'd want to have around our children.  For some reason, that we could not figure out, this dog ( urlLink Suzy ) was recommended only around children over eight.  The person we talked to about adopting the dog was unable to explain this rating, and unwilling to reconsider it.  There were numerous statements of questionable truth, for example, &quot;Dogs are scared of toddlers&quot;.  The closest thing she got to an explanation was the following: &quot;When your children fight with the dog on the floor for table scraps, it might bite them, since it reacted when we stole its food.&quot;  This was so offensive to us that this woman's boss will be getting a letter.  Our children eat on the table, not under it, and how  dare  she insult us and them by assuming otherwise.  I can almost understand if the Humane Society wants to shield itself from lawsuits by placing only dogs that they  know  can be abused without reacting in houses with children.  However if this is what they are doing, they should be honest about it.  A simple &quot;we aren't comfortable giving her to you because we can't  prove  that she won't bite if provoked&quot; would have been appropriate.  If they had reason to think that the dog had been abused and would react poorly to children, admitting that would have been appropriate.  Insulting us and our children (they will beat the dog, they will fight with it for scraps, you will let them do this because you never watch them, etc) is unacceptable.  They are punishing the animal for something they think it might someday do, not something they have any proof that it will.  In my book this is inhumane.  If you push any animal (including a human) it will eventually push back. Expecting them not to is idiotic.  They're holding dogs to higher standards than they'd hold themselves.  I know  I  would react rather poorly if some stranger came into my house and stole food from my table.  All of this turns out to be a bit of a non-issue.  Our landlord does allow dogs in some units, but not in o
