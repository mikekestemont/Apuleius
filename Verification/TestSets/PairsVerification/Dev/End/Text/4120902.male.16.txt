As I Look into your eyes I see all the reasons why My life's worth a thousand skies You're the simplest love I've known and the purest one I'll own no you'll never be alone My baby you Are the reason I could fly And cause of you I don't have to wonder why Baby you There's no more just getting by You're the reason I feel so alive Though these words I sing are true They still fail to capture you As mere words can only do How do I explain that smile And how it turns my world around Keeping my feet on the ground I will soothe you if you fall I'll be right there if you call You're my greatest love of all you are the reason i can fly and bescause of u i dont have to wonder why my baby you,theres no more just getting by because you're the reason i feel so alive  MY BABY YOU by Marc Anthony
If I should stay I would only be in your way So I'll go, but I know I'll think of you every step of the way  And I will always love you I will always love you You, my darling you Bittersweet memories That is all I'm taking with me So goodbye, please don't cry We both know I'm not what you, you need  I hope life treats you kind, And I hope you have all you've dreamed of And I wish to you joy and happiness But above all this, I wish you love  I will always love you I, I will always love you Darling I love you I'll always, I'll always love you  I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU from Whitney Houston
I'm just a kid who wake up at 6 AM daily and spending just 7 hours at home. Nothing special, just loves to walk around aimlessly because I love to travel around and make new friends. pretty busy with school activities makes me spend less time with my family. My dad, my mom, my sista ( who lives in Selangor ) always doing things on their own. Well, i'm not going to blame on them because they have worksssszzzz to do, and i can do my things on my own. Wake up at 6, go to school, back home at 2.15, go to school again at 3, back home at 7, go toschool again at 9 and back home at 11 is quite fun for me. My job now is study coz i wanna make my parents proud of me. Hey, the trial exam will be in a month time. 7 A's, y
