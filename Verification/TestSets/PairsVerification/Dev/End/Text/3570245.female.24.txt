Ever experience that moment in life where the truth comes crashing into you and plumets into your head and you are made to see that you are not perfect after all and "oh sh*%, this is all my fault."  sucks doesn't it??? humbles a person.  You give others so much grief when the whole time you were the one causing all the problems with your pushyness and your persistance.  It has been almost all my fault. I don't know when to back off and let others lead their lives the way they need to. I somehow feel I know what is best for someone and have to help, when sometimes backing off yet still being there helps more than anything.  You live your life in a way that you are proud of, that you feel you will have no regrets, that you are a good person, but then you wake up and realize you have been selfish. That just because some things in your life are going ok and you want to get things all in line, doesnt mean someone else should be forced to follow your lead. Everyone works at their own pace, expecting others to run in time with you is selfish, demanding. eventually it is ok, but if that person already has a circus of issues plaguing their everyday lives, the last thing they need is declarations from you and insistance for them to put you first in the line up of things they need to figure out.  I am that selfish blind person.  what was that?? the world doesn't revolve around me??

Friendship, above anything, with a person is one of lifes most treasured pleasures, and should come before a relationship, if you can't have a simple friendship work right, why force more?? work on that first and you will move mountains.   I have figured out that smoothing over isnt so bad after all, it says more if you really listen instead of just being frustrated.  I have some pretty incredible friends for sticking by me through all my tantrums and hardheadedness.  boyfriends/ girlfriends may come and go, but true friends last a l
