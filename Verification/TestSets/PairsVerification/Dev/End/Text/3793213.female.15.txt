I'm not just hoping for something I can't have Well I've absolutely nothing to say,  nothing I'll divuldge to my pretend readers.   And as she died she looked up at his face and said, thank you. Thank you for being you, and for being mine. Thick and thin, good times and...
Sometimes I wish God would put me in a fairy tale for a little while. Just a year of fairy tale happiness. With suspence and love and a moral that I'd never learn without it. I watched Spirited Away today and it made me so sad about not being able to live that way. Wouldn't it be nice, amazing adventures and romances and working towards an exciting goal that gives you some kind of wonderful thing. Just a fairy tale, a big fairy tale and just nothing but having this life experience. I want a fairy tale. I guess I could make my life into one couldn't I? Loose weight, overcome obstacles to learn what I really want to be, and have a sucsessfull life with love and I dunno everything. Ooch. That first part, the loosing weight.

The movie would get out at about 12:30, when we have to drive home, in the dark, alone, after a scary movie. I liked it. Me and Mike were screaming like little girls grabbing each others hands while Kirsten tried to grab his shirt and he screamed "don't pull on my shirt" which lightened the moment a little, but still I was scared. So we left and I slept over Sam's and at eight thirty we had to bring me to Drivers Ed. Then I got home, and got my nails filled. They are pretty pink and I love them. Well that's all I have to say. We are having a bbq in a few minutes. Oh yeah and I think the manicurist, not the guy who does my nails but ya know the second hand man has a crush on me. He's cute enough. Love you all. My birthday is a month from today, don't forget it. Goodbye, my friends, for all is said and done, and I shall not return, for I've fully lived lifes f
