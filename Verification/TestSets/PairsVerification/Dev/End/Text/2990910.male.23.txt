was in the pft, but i'm in the alpha inspection so that sucks.  what's worse is one of my cpls came up to my room and asked if my room mate's alpha's were ready because his house got robbed and he wasn't really in the mood for the inspection, so we ended up getting another guy to fill his spot.  oh well, sucks to be the guy that robbed the place.
after reading my best friend's blog (www.unclaimedthoughts.blogspot.com) and reading about something called gmail, i decided to get my own acount.  if he really likes it, then it must be good.  so anyway, the email address is adam.shideler@gmail.com
i've had 2 thoughts on my mind for awhile; 1) it's hard to trust again when you've been hurt in the past and 2) we can learn so much from our parents.  i've been thinking about my past and everything that i've done and some of it i'm not proud of, but i know that i've been forgiven.  some of it i knew what i was doing at the time, but did it anyway without regard for people who were in my life at that time or who would come into my life in the future.  some of it was done to me.  do i feel bitter or hold grudges againts the people responsible, no, that wouldn't make sence in regards to what i believe.  what i regret the most is that it made me unconsciously put up a wall so it wouldn't happen again.  i've come to realize that taking that wall down is extremely hard when it's been up for so long.  having to relearn all the things that i've forgotten to do is very important to me, and as hard as i try, it's not getting any easier.  i understand in a relationship people are concerned with the girl getting hurt because usally it's the guy who screws things up and hurts the girl, but every once and awhile, it's the guy who gets hurt.  after showing who i was and the 'me' to someone, after all my feelings were laid out, it all came crashing down.  it's hard to learn trust again, but it's coming back.  i just hope that my future wife and i can be like my parents.  the way they trust one another is amazing.  watching them in their every day life and the way they act around eachother is a great example.  of course my marrage will be my own, but they provide the greatest example i've ever seen.
i've been told that i need to update my blog.  here's my update.
so i'm back.  i really don't care about this stupid blogger anymore, i just use it to talk to friends/family who i can't get a hold of at any time i want to.  i've started to put pictures up on a webpage, but because i'm not willing to pay 5 dollars a month i can only put 1 up a day.  it's going to take a few weeks to get the all up.  it's coming, just w
