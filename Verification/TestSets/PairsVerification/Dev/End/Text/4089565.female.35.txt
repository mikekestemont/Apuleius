who made the difference, not the gimmick. So I quit going. I was doing fine, losing a pound , here, a pound there, you get the point. Making progress none the less (wasn't exercising though, as you know how I loathe that..)  Spring comes along, and we talk of going back home to visit my family. Talk about stress, I could do a separate blog about how stressful visiting my family is. Instead of talking about it, I began to eat. And Eat, and eat, and I ate all the way through our vacation. If the 1765 mile trip through Fast Food USA wasn't enough, it was the pizza pig outs and un-healthy eating with the family that killed me. I found myself within 6 pounds of where I began in Oct.  Something was said about my coming home that really bothered me and recently I really made a connection about it.  My parents are divorced, and up until a few months ago I had a strained relationship with my father (mom too). My sister just now talks to dad. Anyway, my mother made a comment to my grandmother (dad's mom) that the reason he *probably* doesn't have a relationship with us (the girls) is because we are fat like her. OMG!!!  Alright, you know that I already case public places to see if I am the fattest one there or not. Going home was horrible for me because of the "acceptance" factor to begin with. "What will they say when they see how fat I am?"  I walked into my fathers house for the first time during that visit, and my step-mom hugged me and called for my dad. We hugged, he stepped back, and said, "What a beautiful woman you are. Mary, isn't she pretty?"  That in itself changed my world. He, in that one sentence helped me to begin to accept myself. I cry just to think of it again.  Listening to a radio program yesterday, that was taped in Feb 04, I heard Dr. Rankin speak. He said that a key to weight loss success is the emotional factor. He said.. self acceptance becomes a barrier to success. How true. Thinking about going home, worrying about what people will say about me, caused me to lose track of my goal.  Right now, I am back on track, the connection has been made again, and I am happy ;)
