It's a 7 page, 330kb pdf file, sorry but Open Office seems to make bloated pdf's.

I hope to get back to it later and smooth it out with some specific bible readings and other suggestions, if anyone has some suggestions please  urlLink let me know .  Remember, to join the list all you need to do is  urlLink click here ...  Also on the  urlLink Youth and Multimedia website  is a Big Fish discussion paper and many other cool resources...
