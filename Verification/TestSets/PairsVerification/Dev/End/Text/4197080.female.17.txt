said to everyone before looking at me. "Ava are you coming with us?"  "No I think I’ll stay," I said shifting back to watch the game. I figured that after the game I would ask Leslie to bring me home. Our cheerleaders did their half time routine and the game continued. Many inside jokes and comments were exchanged among the trio in front of me that seemed to go in one of my ears and out of the other. I tried to focus on the game but was distracted by the large amounts of random thoughts running through my head.  By the end of the fourth quarter we had scored again and were tied with the other team. Ten seconds remained in the game and we had the ball. Both teams assembled at the line of scrimmage and Ethan called the play. The ball was hiked to Ethan who drop stepped as our receiver, Ben Ludlow, ran towards Westbrook’s end zone. Just as Ethan coiled to throw someone tapped me on the shoulder. I turned around and there was the face of Dylan Cope a mere four inches a way from mine. I began to panic wondering how he knew where I was and how he found me at the game.  "Hey Ava," he said sitting next to me.  "Hi," was all I could muster.  "You look surprised to see me."  "Well I-" I squeaked as everyone around us jumped up and began cheering. I turned back to the game to see Ben standing in the end zone with his arms triumphantly raised over his head. We had won the game and I had missed the winning touch down.  "You were supposed to meet me at the front gate. Didn’t you get my message?" That’s when it hit me; the emails, the phone call, he wanted to go to the game with me and when I didn’t reply to what he had written me or returned his calls he had reasoned that I had simply forgotten to do so.  "Of course I did," I was a liar. "I got here early and waited by the gate for you but when you didn’t show up I decided to go in and I ended up sitting here with Claudia, Laney, Bryan, Melissa, and Leslie waiting for you to find me," liar, liar pants on fire.  "Oh. Well where are you going now?"  "Home," I replied as I quickly stood.  "Oh well I thought that we could hang out or something.""I can’t I have to get up early tomorrow because we’re going to visit my brother at college," I lied again.  "Then I guess I’ll see you at school on Monday."  "Bye," I said making sure that he was leaving. When I turned back around, Bryan, Melissa and Leslie were long gone. I couldn’t even see them inside of the gated area anymore. So I walked off of the bleachers, out of the gate and off school property preparing myself for at least an hour walk home....... to be continued
