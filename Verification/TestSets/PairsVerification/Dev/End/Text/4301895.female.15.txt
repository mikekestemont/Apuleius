something that you couldn't do? You were perfect in every way, the perfect girl for me, and I'm sure for everybody too. There was no way somebody could meet you and not love you instantly, you had something, you were different. You would reach all your goals, no matter how hard they were, or what you had to do to reach them.   ~A memorial to Danielle~
urlLink    My love, the greatest surfer I have ever met, I wish I could have been at least half as good as you were, nobody could beat you. Surfing, skateboarding, sandboarding, there's nothing that you wouldn't do, and you were always so great in everything that you did, i admire you so much. I hope our son will be like you, so he will make me remember you even more, and I will always see you in his eyes.  ~A memorial to Danielle~
