But it wasn't until we drove down course that I realized that the fairway went toward the right and then did a slight dogleg back to the left. Oops. So instead of being on the left of the fairway, I was in the rough. Not what I intended.  I managed to right myself and struggle to a very bad first hole. But at least I had one under my belt, and was about to enjoy some time with my daughter's husband.  We continued. I won the next hole. Good ... confidence building.  As we played, the day melted away into the evening, while the moist summer air moved in from the south. It threatened to rain but didn't. But it was very humid and uncomfortable. The blister on my thumb was painful, but I pushed it out of my mind. I wanted to hit the ball well.  As we played the holes by the creek, we were amazed at how the water had risen. It's been a terribly rainy season, the drought of two years ago now a distant, soggy memory.  As we moved on, I couldn't believe how I was playing. It had been three years, but I was surprising myself. Was  this  really my level of skill? I surprised myself.  Drivers ... irons ... the short game ... putts (my, the green were so fast!) ... golfing's more than just "grip it and rip it". It's the only game where you penalize yourself.  Finally, we tallied up the score. I was flabbergasted! I did a double-take at my score.  75!  The worst nine holes of my life.  All the best,  -- Don

Homeland Security ... Patriot Act ... that's  nothing  compared to  urlLink this fiasco .  I cannot believe this. I cannot believe that something like this happened in the United States of America. Yet, I should not surprised. I mean, we have companies being enlisted as an arm of law enforcement (aka drug testing at work), we have states such as Pennsylvania where  you cannot own property  (you are required to rent it from the state government), and on and on.  Washington, Jefferson, et al must be turning over in their graves.  All the best,  -- Don
In late August, I'll have to drive eight hours (that's down and back) just to watch  urlLink this one-hour, 45-minute movie .  But I can't wait!  All the best,  -- Don
urlLink This guy!   All the best,  -- Don
Can you believe  urlLink this?   Somehow, for some strange reason, this is funny to me. I know it shouldn't be ... but I can just see some shadowy guy, in a dark alley ... "Pssst ... wanna buy a list of kids who are learning phonics?"  Pry-va-see. Look it up.  Perhaps the folks at Gateway Learning need to get a copy of "Hooked On Ethics".  All the best,  -- Don
I just don't feel like writing.
May she  urlLink rest in peace.
urlLink This fiasco.
And the rest of the Extreme Left ...  urlLink this  is what they like.
