The biggest problem our country faces is what he says it is, when he's not saying it's gay marriage. Kind of an interesting look at things, and paints Dems as having the weaker argument because we have distaste for Bush, as opposed to Bush's conviction of moral high ground. It's really well written, if not totally convincing. (i.e. What If He's Wrong? And Our Armed Forces Are Spread Out In A Meaningless War When Something Really Bad Happens). But it's worth reading. I'm afraid we're looking at four more years.

SO let's try to recap. Drove out Thursday night to Beantown. Not a bad drive, aside from horrible traffic on the Cross Bronx Expressway. The family Jeepster hung tough. Found KPs place without incident. The next day I saw Little Italy, Boston Common, Harvard Square, etc. Lots of statues. We walked the Liberty Trail. Regrettably, all of the cool old buildings are hidden by big nondescript buildings, so you have to be up on them to see them. Boston has more used book stores than any city I've ever been to. Luckily, I'd recently won $100 worth of free books from Powells, so I didn't spend any money. Saturday we walked around down through Chinatown, saw the Fungwah Bus services, and then made our way to the Barking Crab for chowda. That night, Modest Mouse played at a bar across from Fenway called Avalon. Awesome show. They mostly played stuff from the new album. They kept things really subdued too, which was probably good since there were so many meatballs in the audience. They sold the place out, KP got us tickets on Craigslist. The city closes up early though. Modest Mouse was done by 10pm. The bars are mostly done at 1am. The next day we drove to Cape Anne and the city of Gloucester (pronounced GLOUSTER; supposedly locals make fun of you if you pronounce the middle syllable). The place is famous from the movie Perfect Storm, and it's supposed to be one of the last working fishing villages on the East Coast. We walked around the artist colony on Throck's Neck and had early dinner (5pm was like a AARP convention). I've got a ton of pictures that I'll link today. Look for it at the bottom right.
Does anybody have any idea what in the hell AM 820 (WNYC NEW YORK) is playing at 11pm on a Sunday night? Weirdness. I heard stream of consciousness fiction being read over a violin soundtrack. But you almost couldn't hear the words, because the violins were so loud. And then, after maybe 20 mins, the story ended and all out insanity ensued. "Love, love love..." some strange woman making an inane statement about love, about receiving... whatever. And then it was ten people talking at once, and then someone screaming in Spanish and then morphing to English. Somebody with more research skills (i.e. time) than me should look into this. A lot happened in Boston and I'll talk about it tomorrow when I have a fresh b
