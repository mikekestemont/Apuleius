to get its freak on?   So anyway, my conversation with M was when the keening began. I cried all the way home. It was like I had suddenly woken up in some weird nightmare where America had become an apologist for brutality and oppression. I had never known, never suspected, never  wanted  to know that this person I so dearly loved, respected, and looked up to had such a hideous monster lurking inside him.   I suppose I should not have been surprised because I've got a hideous monster lurking inside me too. That's part of being human. But M's monster was one that I had never wanted to meet. Now I have. And now I get to learn how to relate with a person who has much more darkness in him than I had ever seen before. But hey, he's done it for me. I guess that's friendship.  At any rate, what was it that 9/11 did to us? It seems to have turned us into a pack of rabid wolves. Maybe Osama's point was to turn us into "them." If it was, then preliminary findings indicate that he may have partially achieved his objective.
I know, kind of presumptuous, isn't it, to label myself "Cassandra"?   Back in college, I was the doom and gloom girl, proclaiming that we had built our castle out of sand and that it would someday fall. It's been a long time. Nearly 26 years. But now I think I'm seeing it happen, and I don't think I can keep quiet.  I guess for me, part of the reason I'm writing this is that I'm a Christian... yeah, the theologically conservative kind. I find myself really out of step, though, with other Christians concerning the state of the world. Everywhere I look, people are all bright and cheery and optimistic, thinking that all we have to do is send the troops into the Middle East and everything will turn out rosey for the United States. We'll make the world, as my friend FW so aptly put it, "safe for Ken and Barbie to procreate."  Me? I say, "Don't count on it." You can throw all the military might you want at the Muslim world, and the end result will be a mentality of martyrdom. You're not going to overwhelm them militarily into backing down. You'll just create a resistance. The more you crackdown on that resistance, the stronger it will grow. And anyway, they live there. They know the sand, the heat, the terrain. We're the invader, the occupier, the foreigner, the external force that's attempting to tell them what  our  laws are for  their  country.   So I guess I'm wondering what history books--or gee, what current events reports--the Bush Administration failed to read.   And I guess I'm also wondering why I woke up one morning and apparently found myself in the middle of  Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956)  with people I love turning into the very monsters they think they're fighting.  That's the only explanation I can think of. And it's not a pleasant t
