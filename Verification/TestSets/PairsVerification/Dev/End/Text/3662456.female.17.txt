Just got back from Oklahoma! Michael, me, Rach, Kal, Hollis, Sterling and Mal decided on a road trip last minute. I got the news like thirty minutes before we were leaving. I packed my things and we all loaded up in the Gasparro van to head to OU where Annie (mike's sis) goes to school. She was doing a sorority rush thing and we all went to see it and the campus and such. It's really cool, it's always been my number 1 choice in colleges. We stayed right in Bricktown, it was sweet, we got this awesome hotel room and were upgraded to have free breakfast in the concierge suite thing. It was tight. We got there and ate and saw the end of Annie's Delta Gamma cheer. Then we saw her room and Mrs. G dropped us off in Bricktown to roam around for a bit. After all of that fun stuff we went back to the hotel and chilled there all night. We played poker and I only got to do my tarot once because Michael and Kallie think it's evil. Then me and Kal didnt go to bed until like 3:30 (after everyone else) and then we got up at 7:30 (before anyone else). Then we went back to Annie's sorority and me, Hollis and Sterlo chilled in the car while everyone else went to the music building. Then we loaded up and drove home. It was a memorable experience and I am sooooooooo tired. I'll post some pictures from the trip now. Peace.
