was great.  They are some really fun people, and it was so good to see friends from Taiwan (the last time I remember being happy and having loads of fun).  Also, I managed to get some flirting in.  Talking to Martha and Chris's friend, Chris Reynolds, about music, I found out that Reynolds actually knows Manitoba (see previous post "Manitoba" for details).  How cool is that?  Plus, Reynolds admitted that I made him nervous, which I took  alot  of pleasure in.  Finally, I got to see Brad.  *sigh*  Alright, I need to explore something for a minute.  Let's ask the direct question, shall we: Is Brad gay?  So, he is well-dressed, attractive, fit, and does his hair... that would suggest yes.  But he is not actually from Halifax, so attractive and well-dressed doesn't neccessarily satisfy the criteria of gay in Halifax (even though criterion 3 has been met - I have a huge crush on him!  But I am trying to be unbiased).  Also, he  did  move to Toronto, which indicates some kind of underlying coolness about him that might be something other than gay).  There is also AS.  AS is a gay hottie in Halifax, who after the Closing Night party for the Atlantic Film Festival asked Brad if he was gay, and Brad ambiguously answered: "Let's have some drinks and see what happens."  BUT!  Continued to pay attention to AS's female roommate all night.  Hmmm... tough call. When I emailed Brad that I had run into his friend AS, he wrote me back that AS had "asked me if I batted for his team. ha ha ha"  What is so funny there?!  That he asked, or that the question was so ridiculuously phrased?!!  Stop being so ambiguous!  Then, when I am Toronto, Brad asks me to go to Vazaleen (see last post) - which might be "artsy/queer/indie", but is mostly just queer.  So, what do I make of an invite to gay night?  Well, I suppose I might swing back the other way.  But maybe not - Brad has a friend from Germany staying with him, and his friend Flo is trendy (and a guy).  Maybe Brad just wanted Flo to see the trendy aspects of Toronto?  Also, Flo has met a girl that day, and was expecting her to show up later...  So obviously, Flo's not gay.  Right?? Anyway, Martha and Chris live really far from downtown, so we had to leave early (2am) to catch the last train.  When I was riding home, I texted Brad: "That was fun.  Let's do it again [when you come back to Halifax for a visit in September] @ AFF opening night.  We should've hung out more in Hali... ciao.", and he replied: "I miss you already".  What does that mean?  WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?!   Brad is either the most ambiguous man on the whole planet, or the most  unambiguously bisexual  man on the whole planet.  Or else he's a flamer, and I am the biggest retard on the whole planet.  Any way you look at it, we are setting r
