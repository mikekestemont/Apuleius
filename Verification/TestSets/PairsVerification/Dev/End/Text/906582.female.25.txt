bit about motherhood . . . said she saw a baby for me sometime in my 27th year . . . that I would enjoy motherhood, but that I would always need a life of my own.  This is something I've often thought about, and realized to be true about myself.  She said that I'd always need something of my own, to keep improving myself, and that this wasn't a bad thing because children eventually grow up and leave us.  I wondered if there was a hint of wistfulness in her voice at this point, or if it was just my imagination.  While I don't think I'll ever stop being hopeful about those events - married with a baby within the next 2 years or so - I've been trying to take everything she said with a grain of salt.  She was  way  off about some things, but she also had some good advice about my personality.  Part of me hopes that, now the weddings should be over for a while (BF is the last in his family to get married now), maybe BF will allow himself to think about it.  If there's one thing I've learned about him over the last 3 years, is that he refuses to be pushed into anything.  If he even  thinks  he's being pushed or forced or manipulated into something, he will do his damndest to go the other way.  But when he decides he wants something, he goes full steam ahead.  It happened with moving in together - I vaguely mentioned it, simply asking if he'd thought about it.  He quite honestly said no, and I dropped the subject.  A few months later, he asked me out of the blue if I wanted to move in with him.  Less than two months later, we were signing papers to buy a house together.  To be honest, I kind of like the fact that I don't know  for sure  what my life holds for me.  I can honestly say I love my life, and I don't mind waiting to see what happens.
I DID IT!!     Holy chickydoodles, folks.  I got it!!!!  I sat diligently at my computer hitting 'refresh', and it paid off.  I got the free weekend stay in Canmore!  And I keep wanting to post about my (and my friends', if they don't mind) experience with a psychic last weekend, I just haven't found the time yet (cuz I don't want to rush the story!).  Hopefully that comes soon . . .
That sure sucks.    $100 for a ticket, oodles of prizes, lots of people winning more than once . . .  You'd think we coulda won  something .  Anything.  Nope.  That'll teach me to impulse-buy lottery tickets for a cause I'm not really all that concerned about.  Had it been the Children's Hospital Home Lotto, I don't think I'd've minded if I didn't win anything.  Hawc2?  Ya, I'm a little bitter.  But it's my own fault - I didn't have to buy into it.  And I don't even get a tax receipt . . .
