...been a long time since I rock and rolled... &nbsp; These are busy times my friends.&nbsp;  Christine and Evan's wedding came and went.&nbsp; We had a really great weekend of hanging out with them, and their families and friends.&nbsp; Being a bridesmaid was no sweat, and Jer and Mary played beautiful music during the ceremony.&nbsp; Now Christine and Evan are away camping for the honeymoon, and I miss them!&nbsp; We usually see them at least once a week...ah well...they deserve a nice vacation.&nbsp; Congratulations you two! &nbsp; I hung up some art I've been working on the last couple of months at Utrecht yesterday.&nbsp; It gets to be up for a month!&nbsp; I know it's not a crazy gallery show or anything, but I'm still excited about people being able to see it.&nbsp; I have not shown anything since I was in college... &nbsp; All of our precious yellow-pear cherry tomatoes have been eaten by some mysterious beastie.&nbsp; That's our fault for not putting up fencing I suppose, but our pal Matt says it can happen even with some sort of barrier.&nbsp; At least they have left the herbs, tomatillos, and gypsy peppers alone! &nbsp; &nbsp;

...rock the...  VOTE!!! It could very well get nasty here in Missouri today...hopefully we will NOT vote in Ammendment 2 (which will write into the constitution of Missouri that marriage is between a man and a woman so those "activist" judges can't say otherwise.)  There is also a vote to build a downtown arena in K.C. (and taxes would not be raised to do it.)  I guess that's okay...I wish they would put in a giant ferris wheel like London instead.  Now that would be cool!!!
...a whole lot of buzzing goin' on...  Saturday afternoon I entered my studio in search of an old sketchbook when a buzz near the window distracted me.  I looked over, expecting to see a large housefly trapped on the wrong side, but instead there was a wasp hovering above the window frame right by a NEST!  As one can imagine, I quickly exited the room and shoved towels around the edges.  Tonight, Evan and Christine came over to pick up their tents that were drying in our backyard, and Evan sprayed the hell out of that nest with noxious chemicals.  Tomorrow we are going in and removing the window air conditioning unit, and later will take down the devestated nest.  Ugh.  On top of that, I feel itchy all over due to bug bites and keep searching the ceiling of every room for signs of unwanted insect life.  Otherwise...I brushed a kittens worth of fur out of Frank's coat the other day, Christine made her delicious tortilla soup last night and I got to come over and enjoy it! (Jer had to work...she sent some home for him), heirloom tomatoes are highly tasty - in particular Cherokee purples, I ate a little strawberry from our yard today, the Prius is fun to drive in - especially when it is silent, rosemary infused strawberry lemonade i
