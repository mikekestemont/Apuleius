 Ashley is in Whistler, so she has a reason. And Andrea is working at Camp B'nai Brith all summer, so she has a reason too.  I guess it would have been nice if all us could have spent today together, but we can't!  Hopefully we will have more family days at the lake in the future.     Anywho, I'm outtie for now.  I will be back later to let y'all know how the day went today! Love y'all!     Lates
Hey All!     Today was a pretty good day I guess.  I got up at 2 this afternoon after falling asleep sometime shortly after 4.  I had so much on my mind last night!  Plus midnights really mess with your body!          I ended up going to see Steph at work at 230am and got myself a tea...she was working with supervisor Jen, who we both don't like...so I thought I would go save her for at least a half hour!  We had a good chat too!  I really needed to!  I had to get some stuff of my chest about Andrew, and how much I really miss him and still wondering why the only contact I've had from him in a week now is an email I got from him on thursday.  I keep shifting back and forth as to my feelings towards him and I really don't know what to do....arg!  I'm getting more confused everyday!          We are all going to my aunt Ann's cottage tomorrow to see my aunt Amanda, Zach and Connor!  I miss the boys like crazy!  I actually hate not having them around...life is a little empty with them not around everyday!  We are actually going up there tomorrow because my aunt Amanda wanted us all up there to visit.  She is on morphine now, so she is mentally alert for bit through the day to actually visit.            She did her will yesterday with my uncle Marty.  And now my mom is paranoid that if anything happens to my aunt Amanda, she won't get custody of her boys.  I told my mom not to think of that right now and just concentrate on helping Amanda feel more comfortable and do what she can for the boys and Amanda right now.  I just can't wait to see them all tomorrow!!          So today we finished peeling the wall paper out of our hallway and now we only have to clean two more walls of our bathroom and strip one more small wall of the hallway (if any of you who have been in myhouse, the small wall on the way up to  mine and Brads' rooms).  So it looks good.  As good as can be expected when we are in the middle of renovations!!  I'm so excited to see the final product!!           We also decided today that we are going to get the bigger television that we wanted at the Brick!  My brother and I figured, bigger room, bigger t.v.!  26" is sooo much better than 20"!!          In any case, I'm gonna head out for now...I will write more tomorrow!     Love y
