John Kerry that I know is not the John Kerry that everybody else is portraying. I served alongside him and behind him, five feet away from him in a gun tub, and watched as he made indecisive moves with our boat, put our boats in jeopardy, put our crews in jeopardy ... if a man like that can't handle that 6-man crew boat, how can you expect him to be our Commander-in-Chief?"  -- Steven Gardner      "I served in Vietnam as a boat officer from June of 1968 to July of 1969. My service was three months in Coastal Division 13 out of Cat Lo, and nine months with Coastal Division 11 based in An Thoi. John Kerry was in An Thoi the same time I was. I'm here today to express the anger I have harbored for over 33 years, about being accused with my fellow shipmates of war atrocities. All I can say is when I leave here today, I'm going down to the Wall to tell my two crew members it's not true, and that they and the other 49 Swiftees who are on the Wall were then and are still now the best."  -- Robert Brant      "I never saw, heard of, or participated in any Swift boat crews killing cattle, poisoning crops, or raping and killing civilians as charged by John Kerry, both in his book and in public statements. Since we both operated at the same time, in the same general area, and on the same missions under the same commanders, it is hard to believe his claims of atrocities and poor planning of Sea Lord missions.  >I signed this letter because I feel that he used Swift boat sailors to proclaim his antiwar statements after the war, and now he uses the same Swift boat sailors to support his claims of being a war hero. He cannot have it both ways, and we are here to ask for full disclosure of the proof of his claims."  -- James Steffes
I just got an email about some crazy class action lawsuit against PayPal. Apparently a couple people have filed suit against them based upon a couple violations of the Electronic Funds Transfer Act. I did some digging and looks like anyone who opened an account with them since 1999 is elligible to be a class participant.  I've never had a problem with PayPal, but I'm also not one to turn down free money.  All you have to do is fill out a form and they'll send you your $50 portion of the $9.25 million, sans a $1 processing charge. It seems fairly silly since I've never had anything but great service from them, but who am I to second guess the judgement of our prisitine justice system?  God I love to see the system at work. I feel like I'm making a difference today in cleaning up the brutal misinterpretation of the ETFA. And thanks for the free money, PayPal. I believe it when I see it.
