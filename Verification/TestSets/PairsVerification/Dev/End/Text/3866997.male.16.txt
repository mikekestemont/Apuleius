thy glory is our own For Boston, for Boston 'tis here thy truth is known And ever in the right shall our heirs be found 'Till time shall be no more and thy work is crowned For Boston, for Boston 'till the echoes ring again
HA! The suckiness of it all! Everything I dedicate myself to always turns to shit for some odd reason. Perhaps I'm like Medusa, all that I gaze upon shall turn to shit! Oh well, its a curse and a... wait, no, just a curse! I'm a victim of circumstance apparently. Goddamn circumstance! For some reaosn, everytime I invest any amount of interest in a guy things always go wrong. Its been 5 weeks now since I came out and I am not pleased with the results at all. Brad, well... that's just confusing. Matt was a tragedy of biblical proportions. Now Drew has apparently found someone he cares for more than me. Well, I suppose the important thing is that he has  someone . Or perhaps the important thing is that I have no one? Well its 3:32 in the AM and I'm far too stoned from lack of sleep to think about something that complex. We're still friends, hopefully. I mean, you often hear that don't you? "But I still want to be friends..." How often does it actually happen? I still think he's incredible, and want him to be a part of my life, but I don't know if it will work out. I hope so. I'm not gonna lie, it hurts big time, but also feels sort of liberating. I had a few little epiphanies thanks to this little fiasco and now have a much more enlightened outlook on dating and life in general. I get myself far too attached far too quickly, and then something happens to snap me out of it and I wonder, "What the hell was i thinking?" The revelation about my feelings for Drew is moving into focus. He is so wonderful. This is true. An absolutely extraordinary guy! But the question is, did I really like  Drew ? Or did I like the idea of being with someone in the first place? I don't know Drew too well. I mean, we've known each other for 5 days and I was ready to do anything to make him happy and want me. What the hell caused that? It sure wasn't because I was in love with him. Not after 5 days. C'est impossible! The answer, dear friends, is INFATUATION. I like how he made me feel, and I liked the prospect of being with someone like him. But again, did I like him, or some vague notion of happiness that he represented? I think we should all ask ourselves this question before we get involved with someone. Do we love that person? or are we in love with being in love?  The Moral of the Story: Just because you love someone does not mean you have to be involved with them. Love is not a bandage to cover w
