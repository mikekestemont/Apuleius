Okay, back to topic....  Here was my e-mail and two cents....  I so wish I was there! Sin is my favorite topic!  How funny that I was trying to find the term for sin that other religions use and all I could think of was Buddhism and I guess it'd be "suffering" and wasn't even thinking about the Rohr quote.  I remember a philosophy class where we debated sin vs evil and this class had every kind of religion. It was impressive how the non-Christians felt so much more comfortable about the topic than the Christians. Maybe because there's no spiritual investment in the term. No baggage? Either way, it certainly added clarity for those who called ourselves Christians.  I heard someone say that they thought of a person's spiritual journey as a straight path with a light up ahead. And if you keep your eye on the light and keep walking, it's all you can do..it's all you need to do. It's really all God needs to help you get to heaven/nirvana/bliss/happiness/etc. Keep your eye on God, move forward, and the rest is taken care of.  So on occassion, you're on the road and you stumble. But you keep walking. That's a sin. You tripped. You hit a little pothole on the road where your eyes weren't on God, your eyes were on the ground watching the dirt meet your face. And the result can be a skinned knee or a broken foot, but either way, you heal and the only one you hurt is yourself.  On that note, evil was walking on that path and making a conscious decision to take your eyes off God, turn around, and walk the other direction.  I think we're sometimes afraid God won't know if we're tripping or walking the opposite direction. We think sin is gonna put us on the judgement list. And judgement is for evil. Judgement is for the person who doesn't want to be on the journey. Most (everything?) Jesus talks about when he talks about wrongdoers is about intent. So much of his teachings were "They do this, but their hearts..." It's about where your facing, not what you're doing.  (personal belief is I think hell is the life you lead with your back to the light).  So anyway, as a Christian, I often get confused and think, "If I trip, God will see it as me intending to leave Him. But really, I just didn't know I was gonna trip. It took me by surprise. But God won't understand! I was on my butt! I meant to be on my feet! How can I tell God I didn't mean to!"  And that's just silly. Since God is rumored to be fairly smart.
