like 9 to me, so im not too tired. Cait went home a few hours ago and im alone for the first time in...a while. which is good and bad. Caitlin and i had some fun adventures with the creepy bugs and the trip to the observatory and the fireworks and the george forman grill and the many many moives and bond wars and... i dunno. fun stuff. I like Caitlin. She's a cool kid. But its been a while since i felt so much like i had a best friend...and i wasn't with her. if that makes any sense. which it might not. and i dont mean that i wasnt having fun with caitlin, cause i definitely was. but... i dunno, certain things... its....really hard to explain. i dont just mean that i was missing emily. i mean...i would just feel sometimes that, although i love Caitlin and we're close friends, its not the same. Wow, tahts a horrible explanation. sorry. suffice to say it hammered in the notion that Emily is my best friend. I don't/didn't like to think about her that way... cause... im not her best friend. im  one  of her best friends. so shes just...Emily. And that means a hell of a lot of things as opposed to "best friend" which only means one...so its a more suitible title, right? I dunno. but anyone who knows me well will understand... i have an Emily. are we best friends? well, lets not bother with all that. she's Emily. 'nuff said. and i used to think about it like that all the time. not that i would ever call you a liar if you said she was my best friend, but i...didnt like to htink about it like that. i guess. i dunno. But this trip... i dunno, it seems so much more apparent that i have a best friend. maybe Emily doesnt have  a  best friend, but i do. and... i dunno, it just seems easier to think about our friendship now in comparison to my friendships with other people...like...now its not so weird to say best friend, whearas before...well, she kind of had her own category or something. and i guess she still does. im not gonna go shouting to all the world "Emily's my best friend!" but... i dunno. just...somehow... im thinking about it differently now.  aaaaaaaaand... i was good until Tuesday. but i dont really want to talk about that here.  i dunno what to say about my trip.  my brothers annoyed me. a lot.  i really dont want to go to fencing.  i really want to see Emily tommorrow or wednesday and get on with our crazy fun summer.  cant wait to go to church. ;-)  I love Caitlin in such a different way than i love Emily. Or anyone, for that matter. I dont think you really love people more or less than other people...just...differently. but there can be quite a difference.  I love looking up at the stars. I should really get to that poem...  I hope she comes next s
