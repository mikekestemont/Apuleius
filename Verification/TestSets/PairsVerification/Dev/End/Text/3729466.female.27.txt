love my boyfriend, but I am hurt right now. I don't know why I feel like that. I know time will take care of it, but I just feel betrayed, hurt, and angry. I went home for lunch as I always do. When I got there, I got on the computer and there were still windows open. That was my boyfriend who was surfing in there earlier. He left his email window open and I started checking it. He has emails to and from the girls he talks online. One of these girls, he wants to bring her to America. She is from the Ukraine. He gives her his name and address and promises her he will bring her over. How come he does this to me?? He promises her he will send her money for her to get her passport and then after that get her visa. He told me that he just tells this to them to keep up a conversation. He doesn't really mean what he says. He told me he does that just for fun and to be distracted. Now, I have been nice to him. Everything he asks me, I do for him. He can't complain all I do for him is because I love him. This is not the first time I see some stupid things on his email or archived messages.  What type of woman do men like? That is what I want to know. Do I need to be a bitch and hard to deal with? Will he ever care for all I do for him? He is there at my place everyday. We sleep together everyday. He doesn't give me anything and I don't ask him for anything.  I am very easy to deal and I don't ask much but honesty. How long do I want to keep this mess going? Will he ever change? Will he be honest to me?  Is that what I really want for my life? What he has that I can't find in another man? I am sure I know the answers for all my questions, but I am in denial. I refuse to open my brain and heart and let him go. There is something about him that I love soooooooo much, but this is killing me. It is hurting me bad. I can't live this way. I know that. I don't need this anymore.  I deserve someone better that will treat me good and respect me. I don't need this shit.  When I left my house, I left open the window where I found the message and left a note on the desk saying "I C". Whenever he gets there today, he will see that and I can't wait to see his reaction. If he doesn't say anything, I don't know what to do. If he says something, I will go with the flow. Now, if I get to my house and his stuff are gone, I will know he is gone. Let's see what is going to happen whenever I get home from w
