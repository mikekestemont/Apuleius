the birds, I love hearing the birds first thing in the morning and I love that it is pretty but I think the city is pretty too. I think I want to study nutrition. I want to leave my job but they would be devo'ed if I did and I don't want to deal with that yet. I need to go party like nothing on earth. I need to dance and stroll down busy streets and hear buskers and the noise of people in motion.

Had a ok time in Melbourne while I was away from work which was really the best bit. One nice thing is the office manager I have now found out (by asking) is not my boss!!!!!! I am really happy about that as he is driving me crazy and making me drink too much to forget about work. He had stored the bf mobile as mine so he couldn't call which was good as he really shouldn't be calling me anyway. And he text messaged me on Sunday to say have a good time which is also weird.
Had the work bbq on friday and made tabouli but it wasn't much fun really and we left at 6pm. Office Manager pretended he had more important things to do than participate as he acts like ciggie smoke makes him choke.
Got to take a work vehicle to Melb, a ford courier ute which was kinda cool but a bit peaky too. Had a lovely room and meal at Bayview where I stayed. Had an ace bath!
Had dinner with Mum, Dad, Sarah and Nicole and had Sarah and Nicole stay with me which was nice! Pigged out on room service dessert.
Happy to be home after a long drive.
Bit grumpy today but trying not to be!

After weeks of not blogging or doing much of any signifigance I have returned. Still suffering horrendous cold but slightly less negative about everything. Celebrated my younger sisters' birthday for the last two weekends in Melb and had a great time but am seriously suffering the concequences. Watched Kill Bill last night, I really liked it, looking forward to the sequel.

On Saturday night when we went out we caught a Limo into town from Mum and Dad's and drove around for ages not paying attention to where we were going and ended up walking for 1/2 hour after that. Em came over from Tassie and I had an ace time catching up with her. Ended up at the Spy Lounge which was ok as commercial clubs go I spose and danced all night to 4.30am. I'm sure Sarah had a good time which is all that matters. Requested funky cold medina and it finally got played. At the time I was sure that I owned the dance floor. Not so sure in the morning, quite alarmed about the position of my skirt at the time. Oh w
