SHOPPING!!!   I LOVE buying clothes.  I used to hate it when I was a kid until my teens (maybe because I was so fat and nothing fit me).  Now, I enjoy it so much.  It's not the act of buying itself as the trying on of clothes and finding a great look.  It's one of my favorite things to do.  I never shop in malls though.  My favorite shopping place is still Greenhills.  Always has, always will be.  I love finding great bargains.  I find the stuff in the malls a bit too pricey.  And you can always find the same styles in Greenhills as in the malls although sizes are a bit smaller.  Luckily, I'm so small so the clothes are usually perfect for me.   ... on to more important things.
You make me want to be a better man...      ...  or something like that, as the line goes in the movie As Good As It Gets. I believe that is how you can tell if the relationship is generally a good one.  Relationships with boyfriends/husbands take on many different forms. Every relationship is different and every relationship will go through ups and downs.  But I believe that the sign that you are in a GOOD and healthy relationship is if, because of it, you have become a  better version of yourself .  Your relationship should enhance your good qualities... or maybe pick up some good qualities of your "significant other".  * * * * * * * * * *  Why am I writing this? I just know someone who recently got involved and I'm worried about her. She's not the same person. She's become a bit stand-offish when she used to be warm. She used to actively participate in conversations and is bubbly and a bit loud and funny. Now, she's acting demure and quiet and a bit full of herself when she's around him and it freaks me out. She's changed... and it's not for the better.  I have been forbidden to talk to her about it since the relationship is turning serious so I'm writing everything I want to say here. I'm just venting...  Don't worry  T ...i'm not talking about you. :)
Weekend at Highlands   Our relatives from the US arrived last Thursday so we took them to Tagaytay Highlands this weekend.  It was so much fun.  All our mother side relatives based here in Manila went on the trip too.  We played badminton (of course) and swam.  That evening, we took over the entire basketball court of the country club.  Half were playing basketball, the other half badminton.  It was great seeing all the relatives having fun playing sports under one roof even if it was only for two days.  I had so much fun.  I really wish we could do this more o
