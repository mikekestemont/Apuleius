Im not sure where our relationship is, because... well... she's friendly, and I don't know boundries. I know that I'm gonna fuck this one up like the rest of my relationships. I fucking hate god. Like always, whenever something good happens, it comes back to bite me in the ass 10 fold. Grrr I fucking hate him. Last night I made friends, and I have the shittiest day of work. Im missing seven from my made? I fucking made a shit load of profits! God damn. Oh well. Gonna ride out the big one
I am having a really good day... you know what that means... shit's gonna happen. God Sucks. Oh well, Im gonna ride it out.
I was at work for 3 and a half hours, and I barely broke 30. talk about a shitty day. Grr. Well, I have enough to start my arcade cabinet, once I get my paycheck. More work on sunday! I'll blog on mon. See yas
Ugh, so much fucking work!!! BLARG! I've been working at my uncle's company, as a painter, and working my baseball job. All mule work. Tommorrow, Babysitting, and sunday more baseball crap. Oh well, XBOX, here I come!
grr. Ive been in a bad mood for a few days now. Me and some family members are arguing about partisan politics. They are pro bush, and I am pro anythingagainstbush. We get steamed at each other, and there is just bad blood between each other. Oh well. VOTE KERI

It should be done soon, and you will all be able to bask in it's reflective glory. hrmmm... Im gonna go eat some junk food. see yall later
Well then... What to say? I have had a shitty week at work. I needed to reformat my HDD. Got my 96 dollar calculator stolen, so I had to buy a new one :-/... Well lifes a bitch and then you die ^;_^. Ok, I will leave you with some words of wisodom that are now my life's motto... When life gives you lemons, bitch that you wanted iced tea.
Well then. I went on a "date" last night. And I'm not sure how I feel. She sort of came on strong and told me about another guy that she's into. hrmmmm. But I like her, and she's fun to be with. We saw The village, which sucked, but at least it was better than signs. The last 25 minutes were just soooo pointless. Oh well, that's 16 dollars that I'm noever gonna get back. I blew off work Friday and Saturday, and I'm contemplating blowing it off today. I am really lax right now... booooooooooooobies. I like girls. Ok, I'm gonna stop n
