already have a sense of what's going on, it was kind of preaching to the choir, but i don't think that was his intention anyway. so congrats to michael moore for successfully trashing bush and co.  because this movie was so successful, many leftists/radicals have been reluctant to criticize it. but i am going to point out some things that really bothered me:  1) the pro-democrat undertones were disturbing - for palestinians especially the prospect of having kerry in office is pretty horrifying. he has been going around professing his love for the zionist entity at every opportunity. but then, i've heard michael moore is not anti-zionist. hard for me to swallow that for anyone.  2) some scenes really made me squirm - for example, while demonizing the saudi family, why throw in the scene of thousands of muslims praying at mecca? and when going through the countries in the "Coalition of the Willing", why the racist stereotypical images of moroccans (and others in the coalition)? ESPECIALLY after what happened to arabs and muslims after 9/11 (which he made no mention of)?  3) and one of my dear friends, who wears hijab, was really bothered by the stupid white feminist who was complaining about the burqa that women are forced to wear in afghanistan...don't you think that glorifying plastic surgery (aka "The Swan" and "Nip & Tuck") is a little more oppressive to women then a burqa?? are those stupid white feminists (sounds like a good book title, eh?) in denial about what is happening to women here or are they just fantasizing the idea of being the saviors for us ignorant moslem women?  so if michael moore's intention was to smear bush, he did a really great job. but if he had any intention of dispelling stereotypes about "brown-skinned people" (as bush calls us) as backwards terrorists, he failed miserably.
How many of you have heard that line? I have, too many times.  "If you don't like it here, why don't you go back where you came from"  How dare we, as an "IMMIGRANTS", question them? We are told to know our place,  since we are enjoying the fruits of this society - so we must enjoy it and obey! (as an FBI agent told me once)  Every time somebody says it to me, I turn that shit around.  They are not the rightful owners of this land. Stop claiming something stolen from beautiful nations with rich cultures destroyed and many lives lost.  If their twisted government(s) would quit raping the rest of our countries, I'd GLADLY go back where I came from.  But they better go back where they came from (Europe, the depths of hell, whatever) and quit raping this country.  In a society that prides itself as a "melting pot" with a democracy and free speech, questioning the system suddenly means get the hell out (or IN - in our jails!)? This aint no melting pot, it's just a tossed salad.  Maybe I should just keep it simple and tell their racist ass to shut the f*** u
