like anyone around me really cares. They all use it as a way to get attention for themselves. Except for Bill of course. He cares, he loves me, and he loves the way I look. I have never felt comfortable with myself in anyway, but Bill changes all of that. For once in my life I don't feel like  total reject. I love him so much.  Everyone can yell at me about what to eat. SCREW ALL OF THEM! They have no clue what this is like or how hard this is for me. All they do is pass judgement, but they have no clue what it feels like to be judged. It makes me so angry at them. They don't care what happens to me. All they care about is how I make them look.  I am so begining to hate seeing my psychologist. I have so much I need to talk about, but I don't know how to with anyone. So much that I need help with, advice on. And she won't discuss any of it. All she wants to do is talk about my having ED, which she won't even classify me with until I am under weight and in the hospital. Which I am very close to. But all the other things I need advice on she won't even consider. I'm so locked inside myself I'm clausterphobic, and she won't help me. But maybe that is just my own fault. Maybe I am just to damaged to ever be helped.  Bill is coming in two days. He will be here on Saturday. I can't wait. I love him so much.  Ugh... I swear my family needs to grow up.  Everyone is throwing a fit over one thing or another and no one is getting along. Now no one is getting together for The Fourth of July, and I know it is all my fault. If I didn't exist my family would be so much happier.  But you know what?  None of them matter!  They can throw what ever fit they want. Bill is the only thing I care about.  Surprisingly my mom is still arranging a picnic for that day. She wants to try and get to Bill a bit more. So I am hoping for the best.  I was so bored I cleaned my house today. What would have taken my mother all day took me less than 2 hours.  But I think i have overdone it a bit. I am so out of breath and my chest has been hurting pretty badly all day.  I don't get it. If the doctors are really so afraid that my heart will stop and so concerned about all the other things going wrong with me why is no one doing anything!  My legs are going numb, my heart is slowing down, now my saliva glands are begining to shut down, and so much more. I am taking a really disgusting medicine to help my glands. The taste of that stuff oughta kill me! Providing everything else doesn't f
