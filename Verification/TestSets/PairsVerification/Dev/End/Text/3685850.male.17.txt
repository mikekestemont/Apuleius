group of social and friendly people...haha...I mean they just came up to us and challenged us...of course we lost lar...I think...but hey...they had the whole team playing...we only had 5 people lor...so they win is also quite obvious one..hur hur...I one person already so many people mark me liao...diao sia...during the game...snatched the ball from behind the person when the ball is still in the air...she see liao then kanna shocked...couldn't believe that I jump so high...then got one time...just jump up when the ball is still bouncing on the rim of the netball post...all the girls were so shocked man...they just couldn't believe that I could jump so high...heehee...so all the times I spent training on my vertical jump is not in vain...few months of jogging with weights and climbing up of stairs with weights is paying off...but I still need to jump higher...must dunk over some SA dude...*dreamz*...while we were playing...alot of people were looking at us...guess they must be thinking why the heck the netabll girls play with the basketball team...haha...but who cares...fun...totally...the only regret was me not asking for their names and numbers...but I think they will never forget me...especially after I grab that ball while it's still bouncing on the rim...whahahha...after the game rotted in the canteen to wait for Nancy, Joscelin and Yuyi...rotted until 8pm...then went to Lot1 and eat...talked alot of things with them...mostly is regarding her...I feel so sad...I think because of me...she is so stressed up....stressed until she never come to school today...then yesterday Mr Tan still tell her about me liking her and stuff...heard that she was extremely embarressed...feel like I'm at fault...so guilty...don't know what to do now...lastly...I seriously hope that you guys(those that know about her) don't insult her...you guys know what i mean(the lips thingy)...I'm seriously VERY pissed off...if you guys want to make fun of me...it's ok...BUT...other than that...DON'T make fun of her...or else I might just explode after some time and give you guys a good whooping on the arse...if I make fun of the peron you like...you wouldn't be happy too...so...stop all the nonsense or else I might do something unthinkable...  d-.-b  -=]CHAN TU YUAN[=-
