bottle all night, till it was empty. You even took it to the toilet with you!!
I was to tired to move or tell my parents :| I thought you were going to a party Deaks, and RK how did greeny go to far? Ah well it was a good laugh and I can't remember dropping Phil off home...  But I still don't think you can call me an alcoholic seeing as I don't even drink pretty much at all.
Lol @ greeny and grant.  I stopped drinking halfway thru because of the bouncey castle + chinese food + alchohol on wednesday.  The may ball was great, but the lack of an afterparty sucked ultimate cock.  Lost.
Granty was puking up all inside his car. XD  I had to sit there while he did it though :/ :'(  Oh yeah; Violation.  | | | | | | | | | v           Lost.
Oh no greeny - all i can say is he went too far XD   So did JD - you little alcoholic......
today u said "Hi" then went offline...  U were clearly still posting on TLA  meh
Sometimes I forget to turn MSN on...
zing, i retract my previous comment...  and phil i know ur online, coz ur on T.L.A....  so anti-social...
Firstly, what the hell is sheldon on about in every single post he has ever made.  Secondly,&nbsp;kirby could at least have left the country during this 3 week "roadtrip with parents" type holiday or am I just misunderstanding him.&nbsp; When he says roadtrip does he mean they will be driving to their destination then getting out?  Finally I hope our trip is still on as I have bought a few bottles of beer back from France at a reasonable price, if there is 8 of us going it will cost everyone £1.50ish for it.  &nbsp;  Ok off to London on Teusday with Mr Rawling and co... oh dear see you when the real holidays start I guess.  &nbsp;  Oh yeah I broke my toe so can't play football for a while.
Sheldon, your not going on holiday for three weeks. &nbsp; *Shakes head*
Oh well, me to. Although i leave at 4.00am :(  Oh i had better go to bed!  RK
As of 5:00am tommorrow (Sunday) I will be on "Holiday." Although it is more of a road trip with the parents.      Anyway... see you all in 3 (ish) weeks.
Idiots..... Slimbridge sucks, and you are too far north...  *Shakes Head*
Ok, meeting is a gogogo.  Remember to bring change for Poke-her.
Update, owen can't come. Meh.  He says everything we agree on is ok with him.
Yarr, I think the party (if you can call it that) at Phils is a good Idea. Also I think we should use the week to stage the staying awake contest. God knows how long that will last. However if Sheldon comes, we shall all fall asleep due to his constand mumblings. Oh no wait he has to work :D.
Wahey, unlucky JOwen but Liverpool 2 Roma 1
