sandwich) without the cheese and onions.  I asked her several times to clarify so I was sure I would get the order right.  Confident that I was punching in the correct order, I brought out what I thought was what she wanted.  Of course it wasn't.  I brought it back and punched in what she really wanted -- a cheese steak without the cheese and onions, on a kaiser roll.  I called Marty over and explained the situation.  I told him that I was sorry, and that I repeated the order back to the woman several times to make sure I got it right.  He was pissed... not at me, but at the customers.  Turns out that they have problems every time they come in.  If it had been Delores, she would have screamed at me.    The other mistake was a drink order and the guy was an asshat and Marty only laughed about it.  Anyway... when I got to work yesterday Delores told me that I have to leave the place "really clean" because we weren't going to be open again till Monday.  I must have given her a "what are you talking about" look [I always leave the place clean when I close the non-smoking side.] because she said, "You left the dishes in the bus pan and the water in the silverware bucket."  I didn't feel like arguing with her.  Truth is, I assumed it was the busboy's job... every time I try to do it for him, he tells me that he'll do it, it's his job.  And... I wasn't the closer on Friday night, and I know Jessie got slammed, so there's a good possibility that she had people eating on that side and she put the dishes in that bus pan.  Delores is a stupid bitch.  I guess I'll just have to do the "smile and nod" thing until she really steps out of line and then I'll talk to Marty about it.  Lori just got a job at the Olive Garden, so she'll be leaving.  Maybe I can pick up her shifts at night.  I think I would rather work with Marty anyway.  Ok, it's 1:40 and I'm still in my pj's.  Gotta go get a shower.  Happy 4th of July everyone!
This is going to be quick since I need to get to bed...  Sweetheart is now perching on my finger in the cage... go budgie!  My boss Delores is a bitch, and I'm not the only one who things so.  Now I realize why no one wants to work during the day with her.  One of these days I'm going to tell her off.  Boy who was remaining nameless told me tonight that he has been dating someone on and off.  I'm glad he told me... he let me know that he wanted to be friends and didn't want to lead me on.  Nice guy.  Moving on...  my birthday is Tuesday and it looks like I'll be celebrating by getting drunk with Ryan on Monday night.  Anyone care to join??    Time for b
