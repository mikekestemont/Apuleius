Well I'm just  checking  out EARL and can you believe it, the projected path at this point puts it right on us.    Results for  St.Vincent (13.13N, 61.2W) :  The approximate Closest Point of Approach (CPA) is located near  13.2N, 61.2W  or about  2.4 miles (3.8 km)  from your location. The estimated time of when the eye will be at that location is in about  47.6 hours .   So  this might be the  year we get slammed .......we shall see..........
Talk about a busy Friday the 13th in the tropics! Major hurricane Charley tears into South Florida on it's way for a quick visit with Mickey Mouse and this afternoon, we have two new depressions to worry about! We pretty much all theorized things would heat up quickly but not this quick!  TD#4 which has now just been named  DANIELLE  is brewing in the far eastern Atlantic and is looking to reach here in the islands around wednesday or thursday of next week and TD#5 (Soon to be called  EARL ) is less than a 1000 miles away. TD#5 is quite worrisome due to it's proximity to the islands but it did form really low, 8.9 north, and just might crash through the lower islands of Trinidad/Tobago, Barbados, Grenada and maybe even Vincy. But you never know, it could potentially turn more northwest so it's definitely something to watch carefully.  TS Daniella is an interesting system with a long ways to go so I'm not going to really comment on it at this time as more reseach is necessary.

As luck would have it, as soon as I say pictures are on its way from the depression passing through Vincyland, my camera packs up and my jeep battery dies meaning I can't show you nuttin' Oh well, it passed by us and as usual it developed into somthing sinister further on up the islands. The next set of pics shows some damage to Cuba on the way to the US
urlLink    Looking good......................
Well it's been a quiet one for this year so far but as soon as August comes around we have two popping up. Alex is hugging the coast of the US but TD# 2 (aka Bonnie) is getting close to home. I'll update with pictures over the next day or so....but off course, we'll survive as always. Remember we're Land of the B
