when no one is around to distract me. I was introduced to a man and his wife who told me about a group called "The Young and the Restless,"- "Although we're really not like the soap opera," the man added before breaking out into boisterous laughter with his wife over the apparent "funny" he had just made. I was led to a classroom filled with people that were neither "young" nor "restless". The women each had a band of gold and a diamond on their fingers and the men were balding and going paunchy about their mid-sections. The women all lacked anything that could clearly be defined as a "chin" and their breasts had all begun a rather tragic journey southward. I was mortified. Why in the hell wasn't I in with the college kids? I had a chin, I had perky breasts, dammit! It was the fact that I had a daughter. The natural assumption was that I BELONGED with these people. One woman bragged about her guitar performance in front of 3,000 people while another worried about getting settled in her new home. The guitar soloist nodded sympathetically and admitted that she and her husband had yet to decide where to hang all their photos. My heart sank to the ground. I wanted a ring and a home and all this idle chit chat and I had just lost the one person in the world who I loved more than anything. My eyes stung with tears and so I fled the church with my daughter and had a good cry about everything on our way up to Monte Sano and Burrit on the Mountain. We arrived before they had actually opened, but we crawled over the small fence and I sat in solitude on the bench. As I gazed out across the city of Huntsville toward the giant mock-up rocket of the Space and Rocket Center, I wondered what HE was doing and if maybe he had called me while I was away. I had this foolish hope that it would be okay, but as time goes on and he doesn't call or come by, I lose the hope and I break down into tears. I can't sleep, I don't want to eat, and the passage of time drags the sinking feeling in my chest down further. I remember the last conversation we had, how cold he was. I had never heard him use the tone of voice he had used, and then, he hung up on me. I started shaking when the line went dead and my arms felt like they weighed a ton. He didn't care anymore. This is the reality I wake to at 2:30, 4:30 and 6a.m. in the morning. I would give anything to change what I said and to make it all better, anything. But there is nothing to do when the other person has given up on you. When they despise you, there is nothing left to do but let time drag by and just hope to God it gets better s
