my blog? anyway if you are, you should not be. haha
i am committing the sinful act of eaitng supper now...too bad i just can't help it...too hungry. horrible meiyi has once again threatened to kill my plant with some evil ploy... wenqing warned me this afternoon that meiyi as going to take action soon...must be prepared.       meiyi sent me all these nice pictures of the rehersals can clams to balckmail me with the picture she took of me...to no avail. i had absolutely no reaction.....to her dismay. yum...this luncheon egg thingy that i made is really delicious....hmm...took such a long nap today that's why i feel so awake now..but barely did any homework....still in the holidaying mode....      oh yess and how can i forget to mention this the ever so hazardous chemistry lab. 5 accidents in about less than 5 minutes including the breaking of 2 thermometers(which contain highly dangerous mercury) and about 3 test tubes i think. earned our class the title of "accident prone" but it can't be helped...who can work in that hell hole? think about it,    1) always wet   2) always stuffy   3) filled with chlorine gas   4) filled with lousy broken apparatus   5) always short of chemicals or filled with wrong chemicals....   and the list goes on.....      yup so that's just the tip of the iceberg about the lab. and guess what? the physics lab is not much better.   1) zero leg room so i end up sitting with feet wide apart   2) ever so grouchy teacher who points and stares and tells us our work turns out like shit   3) ammeters and volt meter never accurate   that's about all for now....      so unlike the biology lab where...   1) nice patient teacher   2) ventilated without nasty poisonous gases   3) plenty of leg room to sit comfortably....      yup so that's all for today...wrote quite a lot.
my very first post!   this is so exciting... i finally have a blog to call mine! i always thought that blogs were meant for angry or sad people to write demoralising things about life to sadden everyone but after blog hopping i realise that there are many happy blogs around to.... plus maybe if i blog often enough i might achieve my goal of gossiping less.       well this year's national day celebration was great, had a blast screaming and kicking around in the hall. the auditions were great too, still in awe at how my class came together to dance as one. and the atmosphere in the mpr during the auditions was nothing like i thought it wouls be, everyonw was laughing and cheering, there was pandamonium. haha is this how you use it? i have no idea. kind of ticked valarie off on her tag board. it's so difficult to get her to back off... makes me guilty      my flowers are blooming! not so upset about liesel trimming the clitoria...guess she's right it does look better now. hope the sunflowers grow quickly... so that i'll be able to see them bloom before i leave school. thinking of growing papaya trees n
