August 8, 2004 Lake Taghkanic State Park Campsite G-18  Camping during the week means the only pests we'll have to battle are a few insects. Hudson is in Columbia County, which is stuffed with B&B's and antiques shops like . We hooked up a sweet campsite at Lake Taghkanic, a fisher's paradise--chain pickerel; largemouth, smallmouth and rock bass; bluegill; pumpkinseed sunfish; yellow perch; brown bullhead; and the occasional cisco in deep waters. Brandon shot a turkey with his bow and arrow, and I got lost in the pitch black woods for a couple hours. Jumping off Niagara Falls is next.

August 7 Anna's Apartment Hudson NY  We didn't arrive here until nearly 3am. Packing with a hangover takes a lot longer than it should. Last night after dinner w/ Dore, Liz, & Allegre (Liz makes the best blueberry pie!), we went out with some friends for a last binge. We didn't get to bed until well after 4am. Finally got the truck packed to the gills around 10pm; I even got to keep a 1970s-style chandelier the superintendent was throwing out. Brand & I had one last farewell drink at the Slaughtered Lamb before finally hitting the road for Hudson.  Hudson is a "Sleepy Hollow" town two hours north of Manhattan; we took the Rip Van Winkle Bridge to cross the Hudson River. My friend Heath is working as the Gaffer on a feature film up here. Hudson is a small town, and the film crew has booked every hotel room in town and half the ones in the next. Luckily, Heath hooked Brand &amp; I up with Anna, the set dresser, who let us crash at her place. It's actually a run-down building the film will be using as a location set. Thanks Anna!
At the request of my passionate sister, I have set up a blog account to comment and provide a second point of view to our adventure and where it takes us. So, I'm not full of literal history and significance. What I see is what you get, take it for what it's worth and develop your own opinion. Never before have I spent as much time with Joy-Marie as I soon will. This will definitely be an experience to remember. The general idea is to travel cross-country with a loaded pickup from New York City to San Francisco while stopping in Colorado. Everything else is a possibility, an unknown idea, an adventure. I'm mostly excited about the stops at the national forests and state parks we may make. Joy is kind of the director and I'm the actor along for the ride. She says we fight a lot. I prefer to think of our confrontations as passionate disagreements. I leave today from Colorado Springs, CO to meet Joy in NYC. I'm hoping for an uneventful journey that has me arriving in New York by Friday. Once I get there the adventure b
