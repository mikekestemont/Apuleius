to go outside and he followed along. I told him that he could go and accompany his new girlfriends and he said that he would rather accompany me ... Wadever. We went for a walk at the beach. The beach was sooo peaceful ... I felt so at ease. We talked as we walked from one end to the other, and back again. It got too late and we decicded to go back to out rooms and sleep. Day 2 was for water sports . We did practically almost every water sport and was so exhausted by noon that we just fell asleep after lunch. We woke up beside one another at about 4pm and went on to play some more sports and swimming. Another waterfight went on, till i surrendered and let him drown me just once. Hahaha !!!! Day 3 was the day we were leaving club med and i actually miss this place. We spent the morning packing our lagguage and left for the ferry terminal. Having reached Singapore, we proceeded for dinner at Changi. When we sent them to Changi Airport for their flight to Colombo, i gave him a hug. Thats about all!!!! I MISS HIM SOOO MUCH ALREADY AND ANTICIPATING FOR HIS RETURN VISIT TO SINGAPORE AGAIN!!!!
