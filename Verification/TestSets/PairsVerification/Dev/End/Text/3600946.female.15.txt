and stuff. And then he left at like 3. I love being with him and can't wait til I graduated college so we can live together. I'm sure that sounds really stupid but I really feel like we will last that long. Every day that I'm not with him just makes me want to be with him more. We've been fighting alot lately. Of course the fights always start out being over something really stupid (mostly started by me) like us not being able to see each other or w/e and then Chris will start yelling and then I'll hang up on him because I don't want him to yell at me then he'll call back and get even more mad because I hung up on him. So we have been talking alot lately about breaking up but then yesterday I think he just had this epiphany and apologized for yelling at me and stuff saying that he never used to yell at me regardless of how mad he was.. and he wanted to make the last few weeks before he leaves better for us. And that he doesn't wan to break up because he really does love me.. and I really do love him also. So hopefully now everything will be ok.   I'm at my dad's now for another boring weekend at his house. I didn't get him anything for fathers day because his birthday was just in April and I didn't know what to get him. But I am taking him out to eat at like Saltgrass or Red Lobster and then we will prolly go to a movie or something.   Speaking of which The Notebook comes out the 25th I can't wait to see it. Chris is gonna see it with me.. It kinda makes me think of myself because they are in love then he goes to the military and they don't see each other for a long time and she settles for someone else.. And i realy don't want that to happen to me and Chris. My mom bought us the book but I don't think I'm gonna read it til after I go see the movie because the books are always better than the movie and I don't want to be disappointed when I see it.
Chris is leaving on Thurs. So my last day to see him is tomorrow night. I don't think it's totally sunken in yet that he is leaving. I'm sure it will once he leaves my house tomorrow night at 12 at night when I won't be able to see him again. I know it's gonna be so hard for us during these 6 months or so but can u imagine the reunion between us? It's gonna be amazing! I'm gonna miss him so much and I'm scared to have to go to school and spend the rest of my summer without him. I have never felt more comfortable with anyone else but him. So I'm kinda anxious to see how things will work out with just me by myself h
