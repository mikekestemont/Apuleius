he punched a guy out.  We fled the scene and grabbed a cab to some other place that was not my home [?]. We walked from that place to my apartment whereupon Henry collapsed on my bed.  Great.  I stole my blankets, curled up on the couch, and was asleep in seconds.  The morning came and, per usual, I was up at the crack of dawn. After checking my mail, brushing my teeth and washing my face, I drop kicked Henry and we headed off to The Pour House on Boylston for the best breakfast on earth. Seriously. The prices are wicked cheap [$4 for french toast and sasuage] and the food is excellent. Stuffed, we headed back to the apartment and [shock and surprise] Henry was alseep  again  in less than 10 min [Hungover much?]. About 3 hours later, he got up, packed his things, and headed off to a job in Attleboro or some place.  Good times.  I spent the rest of the day sleeping in my bed. I don't know what the hell I was trying to prove but it felt damn good.  The next day, things started happening all at once.  Over the course of this week, we [Frankpipe] got a number of emails and IM's from fans in Washington State. Apparently we have a whole lot of fans out there. Seriously. They want us to come out there to do a show. We're considering a roadtrip.  The band all came back to Boston - well except Tom who is still in CT with family. We've met in different chunks and worked on some new music here and there. Mike has written 4 new songs [jesus]. Goodchild and I are collaborating on one.  Pictures from 2 of our last 3 gigs [Farmer's Market (Hartford, CT) and T.T. The Bear's Place (Cambridge, MA)] came in. The T.T.'s shots were a little dark and tough to make use of but the Farmer's Market shots were excellent. They're  urlLink posted here on our website .  This weekend's show at  urlLink Donstock  was confirmed. Nick Amodio's band  urlLink Pachadio  may be playing as well. $4 people - IM me for more details.  I updated the crap out of the website - please,  urlLink sign up for the mailing list . Really. You'll know all there is to know as soon as we do. Plus there will be chances to win free crap! Sweet! Pictures, video, and mp3's abound.  urlLink Check it out .  That's been my week. Web geekery, Frankpipery, and such.   I hope I never leave this town.  This summer is almost over and the reality of  home v boston  is starting to sink in. In my heart I've made my choice and now, I guess, it's time to start making real life preperations.  We'll see what comes of all of this. Either way it's been a helluva ride thus far, eh? :)  And Hey! Don't be afraid to drop an IM or an email from time to time gang. I miss you guys.  Even Rockstars get lonely.   Frankly,  D
