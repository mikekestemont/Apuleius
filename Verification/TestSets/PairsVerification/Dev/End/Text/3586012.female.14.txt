and love for you has not change. Believe me. Don't be confused anymore. My decision is of course not to leave you, but the choice is yours. I believe that our relationship is able to last very long as we are bonded together. This bond did not come easy. Every relationship has its own problems, that's what makes a relationship stronger, isn't it? I really hope that this relationship with my special one would not end this easily, coz I really really love my special one alot...
