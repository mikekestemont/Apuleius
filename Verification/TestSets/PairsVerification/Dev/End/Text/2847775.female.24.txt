Im in Florida.  I havent done much except experience family drama.  Ahh how sweet it is to be home.  I guess.  I feel everwhere I go, family is experiencing certain doom that they expect me to take on and save them from.  I cant even save myself.    Kato didnt email me back, I guess he doesnt love me anymore.  Darien has no pride, as he still insists on tyring to ?rekindle? something that never had a spark in the first place.    I suck.
So I am leaving for T&T in like 3days.  Anne called me the other day and told me about this article in the Valdosta Daily Times, about our dad getting his medical license suspended.  It is only for six months, and it doesnt really seem to be his fault.  But it is like he refuses to address these issues.  If it was me, I would have been in court fighting this, but he was in jamaica doing god knows what.  Anne said it embarassed her, that is such a selfish and typical response from her.  It doesnt embarass me, shit happens, and I am a different person from my father so why should I let that embarass me?  I feel bad for him though, he is under an inordinate amount of stress, this is just the icing on the cake.
June 29, 2004  I’m writing my blog in MSWord so that I can post when I am able to get on the internet. I got to T&T on Saturday with Uncle Glenn.  The flight wasn’t bad, although First Class was full.  When I got to Uncle Anthony's house, Najja and Eddie took me to the beach in Chaguramas.  It was beautiful, I didn’t have my camera, but Naj promised we would go back again before I leave. Later on we went to this club called Pier 1.  It was really nice, it is outdoors on the water, so the view is wonderful and it was really cool outside with a nice breeze. The music was good and I was surprised by how much American music they played.  We got home super late, about 6am.   On Sunday Dad and I went to Tobago, we were in the airport forever because the flights were delayed, but we finally got here and he took me around to the beaches and stuff.  On Monday and Tuesday he showed me around the island some more, it is so small, like 12 miles long and three miles wide.  We went to a lot of forts, they have a lot of them here, due to the war torn history.  I got a lot of good pictures I think.  It is really a beautiful place, although it is very rural, the roads are narrow, and there is a lot of brush.  It is a slow place, there aren’t any malls like the US, or chain stores etc, things close early, but it is a very relaxing place.  I’ve just been reading and sightseeing, r
