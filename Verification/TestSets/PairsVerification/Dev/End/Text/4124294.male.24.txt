all sorts of thoughts going through my head. I look at the clock, and it's 2AM. I stare some more. Toss. Turn. Look at the clock, and it's 3AM. Stare. Toss. Turn. And then, just as I am drifting off, I realise it's 4, and the cycle begins again. Oh, the humanity. Anyway, fellow late-nighters, keep me company by leaving comments or emailing me, or adding me on to MSN at nickmaniac@hotmail.com. It's all fun.  Hmm. Maybe I should've repeated the above paragraph to myself. Might've helped me doze off easier.  _________  And finally, in the spirit of egocentricity, may I attempt to put up an image, testing my newly-acquired photo-uploading skill! A photo of me and a flashy digital camera that  isn't  mine. Oh well.
Welcome, boys and girls!  Having been inspired by many wonderful friends out there who are actively blogging away, I thought it might be cool for me to commence on a blog of my own. Rightaway I can see how this might be a fun/interesting/challenging/boring/dreary exercise, depending on what kind of mood I'm in, and how much the good ol' brain is willing to think up as I sit and stare glazed-eyed at the computer screen. Still, my cool friends out there who are actively blogging away somehow manage to actively blog away every night, churning out the most fascinating anecdotes on life, love and other disasters, and I see this as motivation to give this a go.  Right.  Now what?  Well, I guess first off I should say I'm extremely lacking in computer skills, which is news that should encourage  lots  of people to check out this blog, if only to make fun of all the errors that I'm bound to make. So nothing overly creative HTML-wise, folks, ok? For starters, at least. Heh.  Right now, I'm sitting in a cold room in a house that I share with three others in Perth, Australia, where I'm currently studying. Don't wish to bore anyone with the sordid details of my academic life (or lack of) right now, so I'll talk more about this later (lest people leave me messages pleading for me  not  to). I've entitled this blog Memoirs of a Mad Malaysian Musicmaker, but I'm not sure exactly how much I'll be talking about Malaysia (since I'm not there at the moment, although lots of retrospective and nostalgic reflections will be made, I figure); or musicmaking (since it's an aspiration, and not, y'know, my livelihood or anything). I probably  will  touch on madness though. Madness is good. Madness is fun, keeps life exciting, keeps ya on ya toes. Just ask any one of my cool friends who are actively blogging away. They're mad. All of 'em.  Yes, siree.  I think I'll stop here.  Thanks for reading, and if you'd like to read more exciting blogs, check out my buddy  urlLink Jase 's ... he's one of those cool friends who are actively blogging away.  ...  All right, all right, he's my  only  cool friend who is actively blogging away.   I need to read more blogs.   B
