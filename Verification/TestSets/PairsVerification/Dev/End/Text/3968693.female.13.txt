crap and it hardly makes any sense!!Oh yeah!Now i know why i have so many pimples in my face. Wanna know? It is because my beloved friend Ipsita,keeps on coughing & sneezing into my face directly all the time!!Seriously what the heck is her problem? What is so special about my stupid and ugly face?Ipsita Basu-she is extremely humorous,intelligent, friendly,crazy &amp; interesting as a person.But trust me , sometimes she can become really weird like today all of a sudden she started to sing this really weird song to me into my ear just after English lesson, I was so damn shocked!!!But despite of her craziness, ipsita is actually a very,very nice,understanding & helpful girl. She is filled with joy &amp; laughter , bringing smiles to all the people's faces arond her.Raina SWEETHEART-She is extremely talented,responsible,whacky,reliable,friendly & kind!!Raina is the best dancer in our whole school!Her dancing abilities are absolutely awesome!!!The best thing i like about raina sweetheart is that she is very modest,inspiring &amp; cheerful! You can always go to her for help!Raina is our very own dancing queen. Both Ipsita & Raina darling are truly a blessing to my life!!!Even Janhvi is vey nice, friendly &amp; helpful but her biggest backdraw is that she talks way too much of nonesense & she kind of likes to boast a lot.Other than that, there is nothing wrong with jaanu darling!Ramu is becoming nicer day by day, thankfully she has finally come to her senses at last!Except for arpita &amp; shivali who are becoming worse day by day! Anyways, my pathetic dad is again lecturing me on not to waste my time on the computer. I just dont understand my parents problems, why cant they just leave me alone in peace?Why must they always boss &amp; lecture me around all the time? Don't i have a mind of my own or what?! Nobody understands me!!!Nobody!Gotta go, see ya later! BYE.
God! Why does Ms.Michelle keep on stereotyping us all the time? I mean what's her damn problem!What does she have against us? I mean she is just so unpredictable!Sometimes she is very nice and understanding then sometimes she acts like a bitch!I dont understand any of the teachers, i mean they are all pretty nice but sometimes they can turn out to be really freaky!!!Example:Ms.Zaki,Ms Elizabeth,Ms.Rekha & Ms.Michelle!I think they suffer from serious mental illness!Anyway, Shivali cant stop staring at me during lessons  and acts like a complete idiot! I mean everybody knows she is pathetic but does she always have to prove us so? Another reason why i cant stand Shivali, She goes around complaining about every tinywiny thing we say to all the teachers !!!!I mean doesnt she have a brain or what? But unfortunately most of the teachers believe her stupid& senseless complaints and we always get into trouble unnecessariliy!Now you understand why i hate shivali &amp; have grudges against most of the teachers in my school!They are all so bloody damn sickening!!You cant even talk in peace! Goodness sake!And shivali's parents also complaint about me ipsita,raina,janhvi,meghna&amp;priyanka from 9 s
