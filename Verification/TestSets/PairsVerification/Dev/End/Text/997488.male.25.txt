i wanted to see, so i lingered at the video store for a while. it came down to master and commander, akira, starsky and hutch, or the last emperor. i really wanted to get more than one, but i got only the last emperor. i had seen it w/ my parents when it first came out. i was like eight at the time, and i remember watching the first scene and waking up when the movie's over. anyhoo, the dvd is three and a half hours long! but it really was very good. it's incredible. i hope it's pretty accurate, i think it is. chinese history is so fascinating, and so sad. the story was really intriguing, but it was soooo sad. but now i want to go to china that much more. i'm really into my roots thing now. pu yi, that's the last emperor's name, actually wrote an autobiography. i want to read that. and his tutor, this scottish guy, also wrote a book about it, and i want to read that, too. the movie is filled with so many poignant moments, one of them is the depiction of china after pu yi was released from the communist prison, when he went out and saw the people and all that. people were so poor, and there was this parade that was just ridiculous. communism really screwed over the chinese people. it's so sad. anyway, i watched the whole thing last night and didn't doze off this time. this is something that i wouldn't've been able to appreciate when i was younger
watched the bourne supremacy yesterday at pacific hasting's 60-foot screen. i was at the library for a while, just couldn't study, was in a real real bad mood, and felt like crap, so decided to go and escape myself. half way into the movie i felt sick to my stomach. it was like someone hand-held the camera thruout the whole movie, it was ridiculous. i once mounted a camcorder to my r/c truck and produced the same nauseating effect. when i came out, i felt like i could throw up
i've come back to blogs  fire truck. my life sucks at this moment. ever wish you were somebody else? i don't think i wish that. i just wish people in my life now were better people, and good people in my life then whom i loved had never left. life can be such a bitch. when you're dealt a rotten card and it's not a game, words cannot describe how much that sucks. harmony is a wonderful thing that i always took for granted, though come to think of it, there hasn't really been too much harmony in my life since mom died. now i feel even worse, 'cuz i know there are countless people out there who have it worse than me. more than ever, i wish my life was a movie...'cuz then something ridiculous can happen but more than likely there'll be some kind of decent happy ending. i'm experiencing a mid-20's crisis right now. somebody rescue m
