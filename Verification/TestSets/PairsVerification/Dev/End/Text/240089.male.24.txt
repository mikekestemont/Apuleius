i told people that i'd finish my exam this morning at 9:30... we were supposed to start at 8 and we were given 2 hours, 10 minutes (i dunno) for 100 questions.  well, we didn't actually start until 8:30 and i got out of there a bit before 10... so my time estimate was dead on.  now i get to enjoy a whole week off!!! ah crap i need more time...
