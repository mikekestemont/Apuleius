roll, and I get to watch two out of the three upcoming games w/ the hated Red Sox.  Anyway, I really have nothing to talk about.  I promise to post with more regualarity(is that even a word), so until then.... see ya.
I know I haven't posted in a good amount of time, but I've been busy with exams and stuff.  Anyway, last night was awesome.  Me and four friends shot some pool, played some basketball, and some football.  Pool has turned into my third favorite thing to play.  Behind hockey and dodgeball.  Anyway, their is nothing more satisfying than setting yourself up on the table for an easy shot. Basketball is not my specialty though.  I'm good in the post and average on mid-range shots.  I'm more of an assist guy.  Football isn't bad, when I'm quarterback.  However, all the running that comes with being receiver, that just isn't me.  Anyway, thats it for now, I'll post on a regular basis, now that school is out.
School is almost over.  I have a full week this week and then next week I have to go Monday and Wednesday for exams.  Only about an hour and a half each though.  Then, the first week of July I will go for my license.  I have to say, I am going to miss seeing some of the people from school.  I'll still see my close friends, but not people that I talk to everyday but aren't people that I hang out with usually.  Hopefully, I'll run into them over the summer or something.  I also hope to buy my brothers old car for about $1000 dollars.  Insurance payments are going to suck though.  I just about finished my C++ final, I just need to add a few features.  I'm done now, I'll post more often after school is done for the year.
I finally go to get my license on Saturday.  I've been a nervous wreck for the entire week.  If I fail, I'll probably go into a deep state of self-pity, followed by another week of nervous impatience, since I'll have to go again.  I think that if I can calm down, I'll pass without much trouble.  That all depends on what I do that morning.  I go for the test at quarter to nine.  I plan on getting up at seven and taking a 20+ minute shower to wake myself up, then I'll probably try and release some tension (how I'll do that, I have no idea), then it'll be gametime.  These are the things that determine the men from the boys.  If I pass, then the joy will not be wiped from my face.  If I fail, then torment will envelop me for at least two days.  I will try my best.  Hopefully, that will be enough.
Happy 4th of July everybody.  Today is a day to celebrate the freedom that we have.  As my friends know, I have a very strong opinion on the current government, but let the whole nation unite today and remember those that died to give us our f
