every fucking guy telling me that "Oh, if you weren't so hot, I wouldn't like you." apparently, my personality is vapid and shallow. I know guysthink that's a compliment, but no, it's not when that's all you heard from Geoff for a year and a half, then telling me I don't have a personality whatsoever. GAH. and Mike, I can't even begin to say how much I'm hurting, because we can't talk. I'm so sorry Mike. Everyday seems to just get fucking worse. I drove to Mike's yesterday, and the drive there, I was behind a Mack truck and I was thinking how easy it would be to drive into the back of it.............
i was in SUCH a good mood today, mostly because Mike and I talked for like 2 1/2 hours, and the start of the conversation was: "What did you think of The Things They Carried?"  And that made me so happy. We talked about books, and movies, and a pinch of music. Talk of work and school, and the tone was light and sarcastic. And we laughed, god it's been too long since we've laughed together. And it wasn't an uncomfortable laugh. gah. i love it.      then work, and that was fantastic, I love Maurices, it's so fun. I fucking love it. LOVE IT! lol      except when I walk past Bri and get a shitty attitude because I'm upset with her? hm, doesn't make sense, considering i wasn't the one to lie to her, and ditch her, and put my feelings aside. Nope, that definately wasn't me.                                                      I feel like a ghost sometimes too.    6
I'm only pretty sure that I can't take anymore Before you take a swing, I wonder what are we fighting for When I say out loud, I want to get out of this I wonder, is there anything I'm going to miss? I wonder how's it gonna be, When you don't know me? How's it gonna be, When you're sure I'm not there? How's it gonna be, When there's   no one there to talk to  ? Between you and me 'Cause I don't care, how's it gonna be How's it gonna be? Where we used to laugh, There's a shouting match Sharp as a thumbnail scratch   A silence I can't ignore   Like the hammock by the doorway we spent time in, Swings empty I don't see lightning like last fall when it was always about to hit me I wonder how's it gonna be, when it goes down?   How's it gonna be, when you're not around?   How's it gonna be, when you found out there was nothin' between you and me? 'Cause I don't care, how's it gonna be And how's it gonna be, when you don't know me anymore? And how's it gonna be Wanna get myself back in again The soft dive of oblivion I wanna taste the salt of your skin The soft dive of oblivion, oblivion How's it gonna be,   when you don't know me anymore  ? How's it gonna be How's it gonna be How's it gonna be H
