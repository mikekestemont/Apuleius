mom's hate and that's why I'm upset with myself. I miss them so much I found myself e-mailing them telling them how sorry I am and how much I miss and love them. I guess I had a sudden attack of conscience? June 30, 2004 When you can't tell people things because you're afraid to hurt them is it always right? Your preventing others you care about from being offended, hurt etc. and it's not hurting you not to say those things, but is it always the right thing? I look at the things I think about and they're always filled with some kind of regret about my need to keep things to myself. I hate when people do that to me and I especially hate it when they disregard me when they go out or do things but I never say anything. All my failed attempts to be honest go unnappreciated and unnoticed because nobody realizes how hard it is for me to say those things. I know it's so childish and I guess I'll grow out of it sooner or later but it's terrible. I'm in all my relationships with my eyes half open and my mouth fully closed. I try to ignore all those things that piss me off (although they're not too many) and I do it successfuly. But things that people do and say continuously really end up hurting me and again they don't realize the impact of those things. Every other day I can live with my own vice, being my inability to be blunt, but today it's gotten to me.
05/08/04    Daniel played some of the parts of my fav RHCP songs. :o) I wasn't feeling good at all so I don't think he really saw how much I loved listening to him play that. But honestly, he made my heart skip, I just thought it was the most beautiful thing in the world. The songs that touch me most on the inside, he played. I don't think I've ever felt like that..maybe a little bit when Eric played Moon River on the piano for me but it just wasn't the same. I told Dan about why my back hurts...*girl related issue*. I don't think he quite understood how serious it is. Partly my fault though, because I tried to make it seem like it wasn't too big of a deal. It's not really though if I take my pills n stuff. (I'm doing it again) LOL. I donno whatever. I'ts not like I'm gonna die or anything. But when it hurts, I wish I was dead cuz it gets so bad sometimes. I haven't told my mom how bad it gets either but...my doctor knows!! lol. Telling him about that was really really hard for me. I don't like telling people things unless they want to know and I don't think he wanted to know something like that. I only told Ramin and Angelo after hours of them bugging me about what was wrong. I kinda don't think Dan ever picked up on i
