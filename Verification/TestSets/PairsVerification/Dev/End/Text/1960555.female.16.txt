not mine)  then we went to the market.  i bought a  restored 70s leather  wrist strap for 10$ and leslee got a pair of super pimped out  pink 70s shades  for 10$ aussi.  oh and did i meantion, we got them from the  cutest gay couple to ever exist .  they were freaking adorable.  after that we just kinda roamed around holding our  leftovers  from the noodle box and our  bubble teas  (which leslee kept forgetting to drink).  at about 3 leslee went home ( a la autobus ) and i met up with my parents and we went to  eternal egypt .  definatly in love with egypt (not that i wasn't already...)  but none the less, it's so different to see these artifacts  up close  than it is to see them in books.  i just couldn't get over how these works of stone and wood were  over 3000 years old .  it was just so hard to comprehend.  and to look at the mummies was just amazing.  there was a mummified  10 year old boy  (approx) and you could see that he had wavy dark brown hair.  you could see his eye lashes.  you could see his  teeth and lips  and i just couldn't get over the fact that this kid is really over 2500 years old.  so i was  blown away  by all of that.  and thats really where the day ended... well actually after the exihbit we went to the imax to see  mysteries of egypt .  it was an alright movie, not really what i had expected, but it wasn't bad.  funny thing tho, when we were waiting for the movie to start the  fire alarm went off .  but it was acutally the warning alarm.  it's not the solid ringing but it rings for a second then stops, the rings again and stops.  it was  bloody annoying , but it stopped right as the movie started.  good timing.   [so, it was a rather eventul weekend.  good times were had by all.  now i'm off to go clean the hell out of my house because  robyn  is coming over in a couple of hours to regale me with stories of her  trip to cali  to embrace her  love affair with ian .
