resting and trusting in Christ. That is what we do because of our new nature and desires necessarily. Once man is regenerated, man will use his faculties to believe. Faith originates solely from man's own faculty. God regenerates. Man has a new nature. Man's new nature give man new desires. Man's desire is to trust and rest in Christ. Man volitionally chooses to trust and rest in Christ. Though God is the author of our salvation, and he is the one who makes us able to believe by regeneration, faith is not something done to us or given to us from without.  I believe John Calvin has hit the nail on the head as to the meaning of Ephesians 2:8. Calvin does not say "faith" is the gift of God, but that salvation is the gift of God. He says:   First, [Paul] asserts, that the salvation of the Ephesians was entirely the work, the gracoius work of God. But then they had obtained this grace by faith. On one side, we must look at God; and, on the other, at man... The next question is, in what way do men receive that salvation which is offered to them by the hand of God? The answer is, by faith; and hence he concludes that nothing cnonected with it is our own. If, on the part of God, it is grace alone, and if we bring nothing but faith, which strips us of all commendation, it follows taht salvation does not come from us.   Calvin comments that salvation is the gift of God. We--man--is what is brought to God that we may be saved. It is in opposition to any works of the law (moral, ceremonial, judicial). Salvation is given to us without anything we do, but in our coming empty to God in faith alone.   When, on the part of man, the act of receiving salvation is made to consist in faith alone, all other means, on which men are accustomed to rely, are discarded. Faith, then, brings a man empty to God, that he may be filled with the blessings of Christ. 9. Not of works. Instaed of what he had said, that thier salvation is of grace, he now affirms, that "it is the gift of God."   Calvin is emphasizing the text is not saying "faith" is a gift, but that salvation is a gift. It is a contrast between earning salvation by works, or it being given to man by faith. Faith, though, is not the gift in Calvin's estimation of this verse. He later adds:   [Paul's] meaning is, not that faith is the gift of God, but that salvation is given to us by God, or, that we obtain it by the gift of God.   I believe Calvin's theology not only agrees with what I've stated, but demands it. Faith is what man does, or that which originates from the will of man as caused by the new nature, but faith is not something given to us by God from without. I'll speak more on Philippians 1:29 l
