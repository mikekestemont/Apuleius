going??? I have to get Mike at the bar!   8pm I arrive BACK at the bar. Lana shows up. We drink more.  Lana and I go back to get her stuff from my apartment for her to go home.  I'm wasted by 9pm   I go out with Samantha and Emily to a cool live music bar.... we drink wine.   I'm wasted.   I go back to Woody's   I'm wasted.   I drink more??   we stumble home with some new boys we met at woody's, and i finally crash with Mike and Sean at my place.   lol.... please note how they BOTH had trains to catch and missed them that night, as well as the next morning.    I'm on a BENDER....    Overall, I think it was one of the banger Pride years. I'm a tad upset at some fabulous lesbians who are not in on this email, and thus.... did not SHOW UP! Kim and Ange, though you're lovely girls.... I'm disappointed. I love you anyway, but I'm disappointed.   So to sum it all up, we close as we always do... with the covetted top ten moments of Pride 2004. It's a list that will go down in history as some of the funniest shit ever uttered.   and so it goes:    10) The Gay Ghetto... it's poverty chic. It's very zen.... and by zen I mean zer ain't nothing in zee damn plaze.   9) "Somebody get Chris some shoulderpads... he's liable to hurt himself." ".... actually, I think he needs kneepads. "   8) "Where's Carly?.... oops"   7) Bomber Jacket Baby... DangerShark and Jawbreaker prevail. It's the only reason I'm forgiving them for being MIA on saturday.   6) Chris learns geography: We dont know how he graduated highschool.... but he claims it was legit.   5) Fran's restaurant.... " excuse me, do you have any frozen margaritas? I'm on a bender.... thanks "   4) Black Eyed Peas.     3) "let's go have one quick drink before the train....."   2) Any excuse for Paul to dance circles around you, will be taken.   1) PAT BENETAR?!??!?!?!?!?!?????!!!!!!!   There are two things I want to do before I close this LONG email. First thank all of those who read the whole damn thing, which is not many I'm sure. Genevieve.. you're one of them, and I love you for it. you're my #1 fruit fly and I was so sad you werent here with me. Jeffrey, you MAY have read this far, and if so, you love me more than I thought.... lol. I miss you too, and will see you soon.   Lastly, I think the kids involved in pride desrve a round of applause. Or at least their livers do...  Samantha and Emily... I love you both.  Mike... you could not be a nicer guy. We require more gay between us, I've said this many times.  Lana... I love... let's sing my immortal ONE more time.  Chris... what can I say? I love you! you're cute and funny and sweet and just the right amount of naive. Happy Birthday, baby!    Until next time,  keep fit, and have gay   love a
