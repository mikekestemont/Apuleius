my way of solving issues.  I wished I had the intelligence to sort things out in an adult way and sit down and chat about it. But when you're passionate about something, I find it so hard just to sit down and go "ahh, ok... yes, I understand" I'd rather just shout and scream and cry and argue and be passionate! Others don't like that attitude and when I'm calm and relaxed, I can understand that... But I wouldn't mind someone just coming to me and saying "Bastard!!" because at least that's a reaction!!  I care about others and I thought they cared about me... but at times, it's like I don't exist. That hurts. I'm going to start pretending they don't exist and see how they like it. The main problem is I can't... the reason I hurt so much is the fact I want to sort this out... but as supposed adults, we can't. I want to be retaliatory and full of vengence (great word, not used enough - see pulp fiction if you haven't already!) but I just can't, so I'm full of conflicting feelings which I don't understand... If God's in control, I haven't seen Him around for a while... if you see Him by any chance, tell Him I wouldn't mind a word...
Well, here we go then. I'm still not too sure why I'm doing this. I think it's a combination of lots of things. Certainly one factor is the fact that I feel I'm definately at a cross roads in my life at the moment.  I'm hoping that by being able to write down my thoughts and feelings as and when they occur, I will be able to help control my feelings of anger and resentment. By being able to look back upon the things that are happening now in my life I think it will help my emotional development in the future. It will help me deal with things in the future which have caused me so much pain in the "now".  It feels odd to me in some way that I've decided to start writing this at what I feel to be at the end of my recent emotional turmoil. I have so much anger towards people at the moment, not the nasty physical stuff, just feelings of hurt and resentment. By writing on here, I hope I will be able to express myself in ways I've recently found so hard.   At this exact moment in time, which is 10.17am on Sunday morning, I am sat on the end of my bed with my laptop, typing. I'm still in the half asleep half awake state of mind. I'm sure you know what I mean. That half dressed, day has started but I'm still pretending it hasn't type feeling? I've got a slight hangover (although it was worth it) and I've got no ciggarettes, so I'm off out to shop to get some.  I'll be back soon I'm sure. Oh, if you ever do stumble across this, drop a line and say hi. R
