 i can't wait till she's free for good.  i was re-reading her letters today and we seem to have so many plans already when she's finally free.
are there really signs out there or is it when we can't figure it out or handle it the human mind makes you believe there are signs to keep you from going insane? haven't talked to D since 6/28 (no, i'm not obsessive, i was cleaning out my caller id and realized that was the last date.  i actually didn't think it had been THAT long.) how was last night (this morning technically) so good but so bad?  it's what i wanted for so long but to back out in the middle like that??!!  do you know how horrible that made, makes, me feel?  ok, i understand believing that it won't ruin a friendship (although i don't have a problem separating it, but that's just me) but that was a slap to my already torn shreaded burned ego.  at one point he said it's better, i would've regretted it in the morning (this was before.  it was a long night) but i don't regret my decision one bit.  it just makes me feel like there's something wrong w/ me & that's not cool.  especially when it's been building up for so long.  ugh, this is dumb.  there wouldn't be any drama, even in my head, if you hadn't done that.  don't you get it?  that's what the drama is. not what we were doing, but what you did. it's funny that he was my goal, just to see if i could, before i decided to swear off men.  and mission accomplished.  just read my old blog.  well, we all know how well swearing off men went.  but i had decided yesterday to do it again, give up on men.  and who invites me over?  there he is to be the "last" again.  ironic. i know this probably doesn't make a lot of sense.  i'm hurting, but only because i think i lost 2 friends and i don't know what i did. i'm trying not to drink tonite, but i don't think that is going to be possible.  i'm sure i'll be blogging again tonite...
i almost forgot, becca and family will be here in a few weeks!!! yay!!
omg omg omg.  ABC wrote this note and i read it and told her no on certain things and sent it back and she wasn't supposed to send it.  i was gonna have her change it, but i was never gonna let her send it but i guess AEC stole the addy and now D is gonna get this letter and i really don't even know what it says and i am freaking out.  i would rather just not know.  i don't want to be hurt again.  god, i hope he just pretends like he never got it if he doesn't feel the same.  i just want things to stay normal.  i'm shaking.  i don't like people to know my feelings.  i can't get hurt again.  i just c
