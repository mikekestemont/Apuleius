guts. I  have never had anyone be so angry with me as this new hire who just quit. He would not even look at me. And I cannot figure out why or what buttons I may have pushed in his psyche over the last 2 weeks that sent him into the bad  place. He refused to talk to me about it, to give me a chance to make it right, to do anything. He acts like I ran over his mother. And my Dms reaction to this ? "other people have said this about you, you are why people leave".Thanks, I feel soooooooooooo  much better. Please come in and fire me. I swear, I will cry tears of releif when she does. But,I dont think she will, I think she is trying to make it so awful I quit, because if you fire a pregnant girl, you are open for lawsuits. Which I would sue, cause I hate her. Oh well. I am just looking towards my new baby, trying to find ways to relax (I am having work nightmares all the time now.It sucks), playing with my son. (And my husband, hee hee) Thank goodness we will be moving next April. To somewhere where I will have an actual, bona fide friend ( ie, a person with no hidden agendas, who loves me just as I am), and be able to afford 2 kids. At any rate, I have had a few job interviews, but by the time I start any of them I will be showing, and I havent even told them I'm pregnant. Of course not, they cant ask anyway. Oh me oh my.
That is correct, I am finding strange things online. I dont have the time or opportunity to do this very often, so I do it when I can. I had a job interview today. I told my current employer I had to go to the dentist. I almost feel guilty, its that __ close, baby. I am just waiting to be fired. Get it over with already. Why prolong it, my goodness. I cant stand it anymore. I want to collect unemployment . I think they may be wise to my ploy, and are just being a pain. At any rate, i am up for 2 pretty decent jobs. But, I want to be a full time Mommy. So there.
