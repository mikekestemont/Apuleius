Let me see then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore - Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore; - 'Tis the wind and nothing more!'
hello boys and girls,  nothing new today just thought I'd add a bit of Poe. (As in the awesome Edgar Allan Poe, and if you still don't know what I'm on about think "Nevermore!")    The Raven    Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary,  Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,  While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,  As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.  `'Tis some visitor,' I muttered, `tapping at my chamber door -  Only this, and nothing more.'   Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,  And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.  Eagerly I wished the morrow; - vainly I had sought to borrow  From my books surcease of sorrow - sorrow for the lost Lenore -  For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels named Lenore -  Nameless here for evermore.   And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain  Thrilled me - filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;  So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating  `'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door -  Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door; -  This it is, and nothing more,'    (rest will be in later posts)
Into the sea, you and me, all these years and no one heard. I'll show you in spring, it's a treacherous thing, we missed, you hissed, the lovecats... ba-da da da da da da-da, daaa da da da da da da-da...  Heellloooooooooooooo! HyeS! HyeS! HeNO! Why do you talk like that? I had a sTROke! Woo! holidays, and guess where I've been going? TO SCHOOL! Yes it is the most awful thing to put people through while on holidays, but Ms Callow has decided that we need 6 days, 10am to 3pm, of rehersals. Its terrible, but the musical is coming along well... but thats not the point! Luckily I'm going on "deeper" next week which is gonna be so awesome! Its at Phillip Island and we're going to get all Godly and its going to be fantastic. and a bonus is that I can't get to 3 of the rehearsals. But Deeper!! Holidays aren't meant for school, teachers should understand that, why would they want to waste their holidays at school? Beats me.   We're so wonderfully, wonderfully, wonderfully, wonderfully pretty! Oh you know that I'd do anything for you.  Yeah so whats up with you people?!? I got a shout box and no ones used it except squashy and I, which is quite depressing really, thanks squashy! you're a gun. As for the rest of you who may or may not exsist, fair enough, I know I wouldn't waste my time on a crappy blogspot such as this.   Nothing could be the substitute, for the love I've found in y
