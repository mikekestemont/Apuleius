all Matt!), her little fists clenched.  So I pull a blanket over her to block out the light (and make me forget that I'm at fault for dragging this poor kid out of her nap for an overstimulating walk).  Meanwhile, Izak has decided that yes, he should kick the foot rest of the stroller with great force, bouncing the whole set-up with a steady rhythm.  Under the cover the grumbling increases to a howl.  Then Izak eggs her on by imitating the cry, bumping the volume up a notch.  Then I turn around on my route and head home, foiled, discouraged, and accompanied by the waaaaaa-mbulance of crying children.  So much for my morning walks.  It's better if I just stay at home and make sure Libby gets a good nap, or four good naps, in a nice quiet, dark room.  Actually, this is a cornerstone of my philosophy to encourage healthy sleep.  Be home for naptime(s).  Have naps happen in the familiar environment of a room and crib with minimal noise.  Strive for early bedtimes with bedrock routines.  Do not push for a later bedtime in hopes that the baby will sleep in later (because you will more than likely get an earlier wake-up).

I am tortured when I've had to care for stressed-out, crabby babies.  If I have to go somewhere then I try to schedule it during naptime and arrange for a babysitter.    I know that I'm a frustration to my friends who were hoping for another playmate when I became a SAHM.  I refuse to push my kids to play when I know they should be sleeping, and as MW puts it, " sleep begets sleep ".  The more rested a child is, the more he'll be able to rest.  I was beginning to see more of people and accomplish more daytime errands when Izak dropped his morning nap around 14 months of age.  It really was fun, going and doing more.  But now Liberty has reminded me that babies need to sleep (almost around the clock), and my main job for now is to protect that need ~ even if it means no more morning walks.
