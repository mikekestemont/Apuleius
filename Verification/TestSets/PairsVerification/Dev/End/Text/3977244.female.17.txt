i figured it was better she told me than not tell anyone and start hurting herself. I don't know how she went today, i didn't see her this afternoon due to finishing time differences. I really hope she is ok and knows that she can always talk to me again if needed. Always knew these things on the side of my head would come in handy.          Well i finally got my own computer again only this time it's better as i have the internet hooked up in my bedroom. Yay!!!           Mrs Roberts (my PD teacher) said she isn't going to be nice to Jasmine and i anymore, i didn't think she was nice to us in the first place so now i think we are in trouble.          Yeah so the main point to this blog was that i broke my promise and feel extremely bad about it. They are going to be angry at me again.          Later days
Ok this is going to be the last time i post. It's causing too many problems.     I don't want to hurt anyone or make anyone angry at me.     I thought this site would be good as i am hopeless at opening up apparenlty so this was a way for me to do it without confrontation, but it didn't work.     So from now on you will just have to ask me whatever you want to know whenever you see me and put up with my crappy half-hearted answers.      No later days.
Ok, i decided just then not to go to the councillor with Sam (nothing against Sam, i love her for trying to help me) but i just feel that it would be too scary. I can do this by myself, i started it without help so i can stop it without help- hopefully. Besides, i didn't want to start talking to the councillor and then start crying. I hate crying, it's stupid-shows you're vulnerable.           Later days
Ok, well i think i am doing better if you don't include Friday, Saturday or Sunday. So in other words starting from last night i think i'm doing fine.   Sam wants me to see the councillor at her Uni. When i think about it i get scared. I have enough trouble speaking to people i know and trust about what i think is my problem, how am i going to go with a complete stranger. I know i don't have to go but it might help so i'm willing. Sam said she will go in with me which is a lot more comforting to me, she might be able to help guide the conversation or whatever is going to happen there.   I feel like such a burdon to everyone, Sam, the Starks, Jaz and Sam from school. The Starks are angry at me as i cannot keep my promise. I don't blame them although i still wish they weren't angry and would understand.      There is a report on self harm on Today Tonight, my family is watching it so i hope they don't ask to see my arms.      Later d
