surprisingly her living fish inside.    "See, I'm not that bad at keeping fish alive! My other one lasted for 3 years!!!"  Me- "Didn't mom feed that one?"  "No, it ate the algy off the side of the tank"  ^_^
Awkward ways to wake up:Yeah that's what I said!   Now shut up and pay attention      1-When you wazke up in the middle of the night, don't know what time it is, are too out of it to notice how dark it is outside, but know you haven't gotten much sleep.      2-When your watch says 9 but you're freaking out because you think it says 11, then figure out what time it is and don't know how you added on another digit.      3-When you're physically awake but still dreaming, I convinced myself scratching my bug bite would help, I "woke up" when it hurt!      4-When you wake up at 11 and 3 hours later cana't for the life of you figure out what you did all day.      5-When you wake up at 5, think EVERY CLOCK IN THE HOUSE says 6, so you drag yourelf out of bed, get dressed, and don't notice everyone else is still in bed. Then someone finally gets up and asks why on earth you're out of bed AND dressed.         I have personally experienced all of them and don't wish to ever again. The first to all this morning  and half of number 3 which happened yesterday, it just didn't take me 3 hours to figure out my day was over and then suddenly looked at my watch properly and decidded it was going to be 9 instead.    P.S. Any time I've ever slept in to 11 was recently BECAUSE I'M VERY SLEEP DEPRIVED!!!!!!!!!!!! I can't go to bed till 3 AM sooooooo 34567891011 that's 9 hours of sleep!!!! Only an hours worth of sleep more than I should in one night! So things balance out    P.P.S. Is it with two P's or two S's????????  Myabe it's with none....    S. No I think I like adding P's!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Creap.    P.P.P. Where am I? .....OH YEAH! P.S. .....I think.... Oh well!  Now what was I going to say...............    P.P.P.P.P.S. I FIGURED IT OUT!!!!!!!!!!!    P.P.P.P.P.S. I hope to add to this list soon, do you have any strange stories?  Oh.... and I missed a P.... so P.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why do we punish the laugh by giving it one L to each O, but then the last one  (or the first one if you're going to br picky!)   has two L's per O. Alright maybe I've lost you now, so I'll break it up for you:    example:   lolololololololol      but in reality this is what w e're doing to it!:   LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL   So we give ourselves the false concept of laughing when you only laugh once and say "LO" a lot....HAHA!  Now "haha" works ^_^ there aren't 3 letters we're merging into two! MUAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAA!  Wow would ya look at that? "muahahahahaaaaaaaaaaaa" works too!  -So why doesn't lol work like the rest? Hmmmmm  (that one works too!)   Well it's quite simple actually.  "lollollollollollol" looks stupid.
I'm going   GREEN !
