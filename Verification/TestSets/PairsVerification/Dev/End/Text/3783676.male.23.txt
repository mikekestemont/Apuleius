ain't gonna make to much effort to get into her pants... Don't think its worth it. Although, she is fucking gorgeous!! And having a single night with her would be well worth it I reckon. I don't need a relationship with the chick, just a good shag!  So, tomorrow I phone the lovely little shag I had the other night to see if she's keen for another showing... and the incredible drop dead gorgeous blonde...  One can only hope that something happens with one of them :-P Otherwise, I might have to go hunting for talent again... which is not a bad thing... but I'm running out of money to buy drinks, which really sux ass! Anyway, besides the point.  Had a few beers tonight, so this post may seem a bit arb, but hey, I love writing to this thing, even when I'm slightly inebriated ;-)  Till later. Me.
I've been posting a lot to this site lately... Almost daily now... It's become somewhat of an addiction. Its like a personal but public diary! I love it.  Writing about personal experiences and life in general is a therapeutic exercise I think, helps you digest and think about the happenings of the day, especially when its memorable ;-) Even when its not, its still nice to write about it...  !!!BLOGSPOT RULES!!!
Current Mood:   F***ing irratated   Music:   Dire Straits - Calling Elvis   Eyes are burning from lack of sleep... Slept from about 1 this afternoon till now... around 6. Feeling better than earlier today, I was ready to pass out on the side of the road at one point. Anyway, besides the point ain't it?  So I dropped my shag off this morning, man, she looks cuter this morning than she did last night! Naturally, there seemed to be a number of inexplicable love bites on her soft sexy neck! Rowr!!   Oh, she is a mom, she has a 18 month old baba... She is still married, but in the process of getting a divorce ;-) Her and her husband have been seperated for the past 2 and a half months.   God damn arseholes like that make me sick! He used to beat her!!! I mean, seriously... if you had to see this woman, with such a sunny disposition... beautiful smile... and a myriad of other attributes which make it quite impossible to have any thoughts of raising a hand to her beautiful face in anger, you would know what I'm saying. And thats not the only abuse she suffered at the hands of this bloody prick... Emotional abuse also played a large role in her being stuck in the relationship for so long.  I think there should be a special place in hell reserved for woman beaters and rapists. They don't deserve anything as nice as an eternal pit of fire, soul burning for an eternity... agonizing, excruciating pain. Nothing that nice should await guys like that. I wish I could dream of a more sadistic and cruel way to punish them for an eternity... I leave that to the universe though...  B
