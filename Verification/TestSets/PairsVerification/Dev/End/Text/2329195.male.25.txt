that we went down to meet JoJo for a drink after her class.&nbsp; she is free cos&nbsp;Steven is on duty. so we went to Cafe Cartel at PS. food is quite nice. i like my drink too. think is ice coffee with whip cream + caramel topping. in summary, good place to go for dinner but i find the sofa seats pretty dirty. as in i find a lot of food crumps on the seats. think the waiter or waitress simply brush them off the table while clearing up. so if i were to return, i'll just&nbsp;keep to the plastic seats. hehe. we did some people watching too. though i'm sitting facing inward so the only pple i can watch are those in the restaurant. poor Joseph kanna suan by me most of the time today. sorry bro, just joking la. hehe.   after the meal, we accompany Joseph to buy movie tickets for tomorrow's hot date. on the&nbsp;side note, he bought 2 tickets for "Brotherhood" and guess what, the cashier tell him specifically that&nbsp;the&nbsp;friend who is watching with him must&nbsp;be at least 16.&nbsp;wahaha. we&nbsp;concluded that it must have been because JoJo is with him when he bought the ticket. well, no choice lor, cos JoJo&nbsp;has quite a trendy dress sense so pple will think that&nbsp;she is still a "xiao mei mei". hmm, then Joseph has this good boy next door&nbsp;look (not the nerdy kind). and me&nbsp;needless to say, the&nbsp;skinny, plain, non-looker kind. haha.   okie, back to the&nbsp;main topic... joseph's hot date...&nbsp;&nbsp;from what i hear, his date should be quite a nice gal. hope they will get together. hmm... but when that happen, i will have one less kaki to go out with on weekend. :( &nbsp;well, no choice la, as long as he is happy. keke. oh, and i bought Touching Silk by Frank Steiner Jr today. just had to get my hands on it after briefly catching the first few songs being played. didn't had any regrets.&nbsp;oh... i must remember what i promise JoJo. ;)   my ex sec sch schoolmate mum drop by&nbsp;at night&nbsp;to look for my mum. long time since i last saw her since the family moved to BB. mentioned that she has nose cancer (detected one yr ago) but is now recovering. no wonder she looks thinner now. am glad to hear that she is better. hmm long time since i saw her son JM. will need to find a day to maybe catch up with him.   gosh, i must have been away for too long. look at what a long post i wrote (for my own standard). :P
It has been a while since i last updated.  Work has kept me busy most of the time.  And school has started again. Will be getting busy by the day.  Other than that, i spent the rest of the time at home.&nbsp;   I had something planned in Aug, during the national day weekend.  Will be travelling with Joseph to HK.  Had our tickets and our hotel&nbsp;booked this morning.  Hope to catch up with a friend while i'm there. :
