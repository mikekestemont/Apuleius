up. Well, I am waking up. It only takes an hour and a half. I am still having coffee anyway. The point is that I shouldn't write in the morning. I sound like such a prick... would you read that stuff up there... Just listen to the Beta Band and ignore the hell out of me.&nbsp;   BREAKING NEWS:   urlLink Beta Band breaks up!
urlLink    Everybody's got a side project these days.  urlLink The Elected  is Blake Sennett's of  urlLink Rilo Kiley . Sounding like a cross between  urlLink Conor Oberst  and  urlLink Elliott Smith  and links from their site for  urlLink Team Love  and liner notes thanking Smith, this probably isn't much of a coincidence. Jenny Lewis, Sennett's cohort in Rilo Kiley and Jimmy Tamborello of The Postal Service (I'm not obsessed, really!), collaborate on a few songs, so the gang's all here. urlLink    urlLink Sub Pop  seems to be having their best year since  urlLink Bleach  was released.
OK, I can't help it. If ever there was an electronic artist I near   worshipped   over all others, it would have to be Amon. Hence another track. This one is pulled from my favorite project of his to date, "Permutation". The word meaning  'A group of elements from a set in which the order of the elements is important.'  Amon has that approach with this album more so than in others.  Toys  shows a more playful yet sinister side of Amon, and one that I find quite agreeable. Tidy some?     >: }
We don't usually post news here but we feel  urlLink this article  about  urlLink The Postal Service 's debut album  urlLink Give Up  (one of our favorite new albums) is worth noting because it talks about "the promotional value of a free track."
urlLink    Speaking of SDRE, three of the original members have reunited to form  urlLink The Fire Theft . I understand why they did not keep their original moniker, as this new incarnation of the band veers considerably from where the original group left off, with a more almost  urlLink classic rock  feel. It took me quite a few listens to the first  urlLink Sunny Day Real Estate  album to get into it, so maybe I need to give it a few more listens before making a final judgement.
urlLink     urlLink Sunny Day Real Estate  - godfather's of emo before Jeremy Enigk found god and Nate Mendel and William Goldsmith found the  urlLink Foo Fighters .     Lately, I've come across a new deluge of anti-emo  urlLink communities . I thought that backlash happened 3 years ago, but apparently the inundation of recent label signings of bands like  urlLink Yellowcard ,  urlLink Story of the Year  and  urlLink Switchfoot  have old schoolers crying foul. The funny thing is, old school emo wasn't called emo, it was called  urlLink Weezer  - before they went all  urlLink Sabbath , of course. And don't email me to say it was actually  urlLink Fugazi  or  urlLink Minor Threat  that was the original emo, all true hipsters know that it was Kermit the Frog's "It's Not Easy Being G
