This is a great game about Bush: http://bushgame.com/  It's pretty funny.  It also teaches a few lessons, and if you don't have the time to play the game (like myself), I recommend you skip to the lesson sections of the game:   urlLink Surplus Deficit      urlLink Budget Crisis   urlLink Estate Tax   urlLink Tax Cuts for the Rich   urlLink Bush and Enron   urlLink Halliburton and Tax Shelters   urlLink The Environment   urlLink Jobs and Benefits   urlLink God and Terrorism
I went to the John Edwards rally in Little Rock.  I will post highlights in a few days with pictures and video (I'm too lazy right now).
My sister just arrived back from the Philippines.  I learned quite a bit more about my relatives, even though I have been there before.
