closer to my mother, he thought I was making a bad choice by moving to Ontario. He couldn't understand why I would care enough to look after mom while she was battling cancer, since she never really gave a damn about anybody else but herself. My mother would later say the same thing about my father a few years later, though he wasn't ill at the time. Once my father finished putting his two cents in, he wished me luck and we sat down to dinner. It wasn't often that I was able to sit down to dinner with my father, this was a rare occassion.  After dinner it was time to figure out what the hell was wrong with the cat. What normally was a brave, fearless cat, was now a scared, big ball of black fur. I spent the better part of an hour trying to corner it so I could grab it, feed it, and stuff it back in the pet tote. When I did finally corner it I couldn't reach the damn thing.

There was no way she was going into the pet tote as far as she was concerned. Ever try to reason with a cat? It doesn't work. The more I tried to reason with her, or beg her to come out, the more stupid and angrier I got. It got to the point that I was just grabbing and tossing everything that got in my way. After becoming totally frustrated, my cat decided to be co-operative and sauntered out of the junk pile in her arrogant, catty little way. I quickly grabbed her by the scruff of her neck, shouted obscenities at her and tossed her into the pet tote, vowing to never let her out until I arrived in Ontario. That would turn out to be about a 13 hour d
