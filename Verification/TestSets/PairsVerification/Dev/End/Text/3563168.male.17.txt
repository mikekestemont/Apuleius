90s. Those were the best. Not to mention actually funny.  The problem is that everyone is trying to make an instant hit, and they fail to realize in the midst of all that bullshit advertising with shitty ass music that sitcoms are supposed to be funny. There's always some big shot star that just fails because it's not big stars who make the show good. It's the writing.  All the good comedies I'm talking about stared no names who made it to the top for being funny, not movie actors or washed up actors that want another job. Trust me, it always fails.  Also, importing shows from other countries and trying to make them American fails too. That "Coupling" show was terrible. Except I'll give it some credit because the British version was terrible too. I hope that show burns in hell forever.  Anyway, my point is that stupid damn executives that have rods up their asses with rods up their asses don't know how to get things done anymore, and it's making TV more of a shit box now than it ever was.
NOTE: This is the third fucking time that I’ve written this fucking piece of shit post because my god damn fucking computer keeps fucking up on me. When I get a new one someday, I’m going to take this one and throw it off of Stanridge Stadium and laugh at it’s piece-of-shit-oscity. Not to mention that my computer was made by some mother fucker who prolly used rubber bands and old Dukes of Hazard Lunch boxes.  NOW, let’s hope this fucking works. I wanted to let people know about how awesome the Rocky series is and that if they haven’t seen it then they’re missing out. I’m pretty sure Rocky set the standard for beating the shit out of people.     There are some things that most people don’t know about Rocky. First off, you could break cement on his rock hard abs. I say this because I’m confident in my straight, manly way of life. Secondly, Rocky, Jay Leno, Matlock, and Donald Trump all get together on Friday nights to play Blackjack and discuss how awesome they are. Nobody ever wins because they’re all unbeatable at everything.  In my book, Rocky has the world record for beating ass to a bloody pulp. A record which will never be broken.
MY COMPUTER IS A FUCKING ASS PIECE OF DOG SHIT.
Has anyone ever played that SNES game Starfox? If you haven't, then this post will probably suck. But if you have, then you should know what I'm talking about if you're not Freddy Kruger.  The point that I'm trying to make is that Starfox is fucking creepy. Not the N64 version, but the original. I mean, come on, those voices scare the shit out of me. Not to mention that psycho music that sounds like somebody with a chain saw is about to cut your head off.  If I ever grow up to be a jackass, I'm gonna make my kids play Starfox as a punishment so that they'll have n
