Click this link for photos:   urlLink http://www.flickr.com/photos/funkyjam/    I've just spent the past two hours configuring my blog with Flikr - a new photo website - so moving forward, it should be quite easy for me to incorporate pics with my blog. It seems that with blogger, we'll always have to link to another site to see the pix, so let's hope it works well for everyone.  I love to take photos and I share a relatively small number of them, so maybe now they'll be seen by more friends and family.  This afternoon we visited my grandparents in Chappaqua. Steven and Daniella (my Grandfather, Manfred's, daughter and son-in-law) came to visit. See Manfred is actually my Step-Grandfather, but I never know my real grandfather, so I think of him as my grandfather.  Anyway, Steven is an OBGYN who specializes in difficult pregnancies. Woman from all over the world travel to see him and get his advice.    When Sang was in her first trimester, she suffered from hype-emesis gravidarum (trans "hyper vomiting and nausea"). Unformatunately this all started at about the time we were leaving for Korea to spend "Chusok" (New Year's) with Sang's family.  To make a long story short, because it's now 3 am, Steven fielded many phone calls from me while in Korea and for the next couple of months. His confidence comforted us in knowing that Sang's condition was not harmful to the baby and provided an amazing second opinion.  The details I will go into later.  Enjoy the pix. As I commented on the laundry shot, I almost melted when I walked into Olivia's room this evening and saw the laundry lying flat on the bed to dry. It was amazingly cute and I realized how soon Olivia will be wearing them!  Before I finish: Last night we saw "Spiderman 2." Aside from being very entertaining, The loud noises from the film's special EFX coupled with the sharp blasts from the score's horns, seemed to thoroughly freak Olivia out. I had my hand on sang's stomach for a good portion of the movie and she was stretching from side to side. Obviously if we thought it was harming her, we would have left, but it was more of an amazing experience to know that our daughter's reflexes are in goood-working order and she is reacting to the stimuli in her (or invading her) environment!  When we got home, Sang was experiencing extreme heartburn or "ulcer pain" as she calls it. Turns out popcorn is really hard for her to digest. Anyway, she almost had me believing that she was going into labor. So much that I grabbed the handout Carmen gave us and reviewed the symptoms of labor and threw a few more things on the pile that will go into the bag that I bring to the hospital. One thing I haven't finished it the delivery room mix. T
