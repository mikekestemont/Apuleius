Godalming. Later the reception was outside with champagne, tiny sandwiches, and cute little deserts. It was a wonderful day, low 80s and sunshine. Of course the English felt is was too hot, but we loved it. The HeadMaster said all men could take off their jackets at one point and hoped that the ladies would forgive them. By that time though Dave had already taken off his jacket and loosened his tie. The guys in kilts had it made! The reception was outside with a white tent with tables decorated fancy. The newlyweds went off to Malaysia after the best man’s speech. After they left, some beer was brought out with a roasted hog, salads, rolls, and all the fixins. Yee haw!! Day 6 Our last stop was Edinburgh Scotland. The weather on the whole trip was wonderful and better than expected. Around 70-75 and cloudy to partly sunny. We saw the castle in Edinburgh and the Royal Mile, although I think we walked 10 miles that day. It was hard for us to keep up with George, he has too much energy. We made it to his home (2 hrs south) later that day and we stayed in a small cottage on the property, it was cute and all we needed. There were sheep and rock walls all around. Day 7-10 The next day George took us up a mountain. It was the actual spot where he proposed to Kathy 8 years ago. When you make it to the top it is tradition to put a rock on the huge pile of rocks indicating all of those who have climbed before you. By the time I got to the top I was ready for some pizza! Later we went back to the house and his family fixed us bread, cheese, and fruit for our lunch. George’s mother is a vegetarian and we were hungry wanting some meat and pudding after all that climbing! We went to see a couple of castles. One was castle Threaves home of Archie the Grim who was a military leader and another castle I can’t remember the name right now. We had lotsa tea or at least I did and crumpets which are like a sweet biscuit with raisins. On the last day we walked along the coast of Scotland near a town called Rockcliffe. Anyway, we did see a lot of the countryside and did get some good pictures
