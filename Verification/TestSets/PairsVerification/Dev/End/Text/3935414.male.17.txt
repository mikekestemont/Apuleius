my own. hope viewers will like it. Well i will talk about myself as you know its my blog anyway. Firstly i would like to begin with my primary school. I was enrolled into Rulang Primary School when i graduated from K2. I had have several good or rather very caring form teachers throughout my primary school life.For primary one and two, i had this sweet malay form teacher named Miss Hani, whom later joined a insurance company called AIA. Then during primary 3 and 4, my form teacher was Mrs Magaret Lai. She was one of the teachers whom had left me the deepest impression because she was so caring that when i was promoted to primary 5, i told her about the bad results that i had scored for my exams. She actually was very concerned that she offered to help me get a tutor but at that time, i already had a personal tutor. Subsequently, she left Rulang and join greenridge where i heard nothing from her anymore. When i reached primary six, i had a "wonderful" teacher whom you could said you either hate her or like her, but do we had a choice. She had high expectations of our class, i can said without her, i don't think i could get such a fabulous results when the PSLE results was annouced. I got 237 which was quite good in my class at that time. Thanks to her. Frankly speaking, my life in primary school was not at all fun and interesting at all, basically, i was insulted by few of my friends that i am a sissy and whatsoever, its not pleasant at all. Just because that i mixed with girls most of my time and eventually now that i knew girls better than some of the guys you know. Easily click in with the girls la. I had a few best friends during the primary schools years, some are Xiao yun, hajah, sum kar leong, li hui 6L, Andrea, and lots of them. I also got my first trophy at the last year of my primary school sports day, when i took part in the 400m B Boys. Surprised though i got in first. If not for the malay guy from yellow house, he sprained his leg or ankle or whatever, he could easily beaten me and ran away with the champion while i will get home a silver trophy instead of a golden one. haha, lucky me, i would say.
