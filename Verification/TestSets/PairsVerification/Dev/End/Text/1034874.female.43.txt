my car in the Big Lots parking lot away from the store, and locked it. We haven't gone back to get it yet.  I had to go into town this morning by myself because I found out we were completely out of toilet paper. I thought we had some in the small bathroom, but found out I was wrong. I wanted to have Kent drive and the girls would have to go, but Cayla wouldn't wake up. So I went by myself.  We need to get our sleep cycles back to something closer to normal. Amanda is staying up all night to play Graal and sleeping during the day. I'm staying up late (or early, if you want to look at it that way). Cayla stays up late, too. She's always hard to wake up, even when she sleeps "regular" hours.
That's Cayla's sound of frustration.  That's what I said when I found out my emails had been disabled by my esteemed ISP.  Yesterday I called to cancel Frontier Choices since I'm not using the options. They offered to take $20 off my bill for six months if I would keep it for that time. I agreed.

Don't mind me - after all, this is my  random babble .
I'm still (slightly) amused by these commercials. I haven't gotten tired of them ... yet. Maybe by tomorrow morning.  The four of us went to supper at BK tonight. I discovered they are promoting  urlLink The Simple Life 2 - Road Trip . I can't begin to express the level of thrill I am feeling. Remind me not to eat in the dining room at BK until this is over.  Every time I hear Paris Hilton's name, I recall that her great-great-grandmother (Conrad Hilton's mother) was Mary Laufersweiler. As in Laufersweiler-Sievers Funeral Home in Fort Dodge, Iowa. And, I can't help but wonder why they don't have a season of The Simple Life in Fort Dodge. Paris could visit her Laufersweiler cousins and learn all about the funeral home business. I bet they would be t
