paranoid security guards, no North Korean refugees protesting outside nothing. I just walked right in and they didn't even want to see my ID or anything. Nobody spoke any English so I just wrote down different impressions and took pictures at the event. Took a good picture of the North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs giving his speach in front of portraits of the "Divine Leaders" of his country. Yesterday was a good day. It was the printing day, so we were busy. It was also my birthday.  Our paper was done on time and then out of nowhere a cake and a bottle of vodka appeared. Very nice. Everytime a bottle was empty someone was sent out to get a new one, so we stayed at the office for quite a while.
The answer to the question in my former post is obviously no. I did not get any work done. I did however have a very surreal day, but also a very interesting and fun one. Before going out to the farm I et up with a couple of people for lunch. Chinese food and beer... Lovely. So we were mildly buzzed by the time we were supposed to go to the farm. Our driver was Christian, a young German man who has his own business here. He picked us up in his landcruiser and off we went. There were eight of us in the car. Eight people, that is. There was also one wolf! Not dog... Wolf! Honestly. Christian owns a wolf. It's still a cub and he's had it for three months. 45 minutes after departing eight people and a wolf reached the farm. We had brought a keg of beer, so the spirits were high. At the farm we got the grand tour and the we had a barbeque. Plenty of meat and beer. Then unfortunately someone got the bright idea to bring out the vodka (was it me? I can't remember) In Mongolia you drink vodka from a small bowl which is then passed around. That bowl got passed around a lot! So by then we were all - apert from the driver - quite drunk. So what did the drunk people think of next? Shooting, obviously. Werner (the German farmer) had an old Czhek military rifle, so now it was time to hit a few rounds. We had a small competition. We had to hit a metal plate. And the results were as follows. Soeren (A total of four years in the Danish Armt) zero points. Horst (Five years in the French foreign legion) zero points. Stefan (Construction worker who had never fired a rifle before and were more drunk than the rest of us) one point. Not my finest hour! Arrived back home quite late. By then I smelled like farm, smoke, gunpowder, beer, vodka and wolf (as the cub had been sitting on my lap all the way home). The next morning it took me about 15 minutes to wash the smell off me... And I only had cold water!!! Served me r
