love it, yet still fun to cruise around in. I trust her a lot. (The dinghys name is Caroline :-p ) So, I was at the boat friday, and the dinghy didnt have the engine on it.. the engine gets removed and put in the back of the big boat whenever we bring the dinghy somewhere, because we dont want to lose the engine!  With all of the very nice people at the marina...or dock, where we keep our boat, they helped me out... We brought caroline over to an open slip next to the Chris Craft, and we put the engine on :) After a couple of minutes of setting the fuel line up right, and pumping out all of the rain water from the dinghy, I started her up and let her scream :) I love that motor so much. Takes one pull to start it  every time!  So, I was happy, took a lap around the dock, then put caroline back off the bow of the Chris Craft, and I left. Here is a picture that I took of Caroline while I spent a good 5-6 hours on her when I was at Block Island.  http://www.naoxhosting.com/caroline.JPG  So, I had a good friday, enjoyed it.  Then I went home, and went  to the movies :)
Today I woke up at 6:15 for work, got to work at 8am.....got off work at 4pm. After helping Mike rebuild his lower unit of his outboard engine, I took Lucy and Mike out for a ride up the river and back in the Mako.. (22 foot Mako, center console) ...its a boat lol....Well, it was fun, cruisin right along, good knowing i'm faster than 90% of the people on the river :) I love that boat with all my heart, I named her Tracy (you wouldnt understand love for a machine untill you own a car or boat that you actually want)....She always gives me a lot of fun, this was the 3rd ride of the year, and first year I have had her, so it was fun. I'm really trusting her A LOT more and more, knowing that when i get pushed away from the dock, when i go for the key... I know it will start on the first attempt. Its a 1975 22' Mako Center Console with a 1998 Yamaha 150HP V6 2-stroke engine. Very nice, and very fast. Good condition boat too, I think i'm going to name the boat 'Second Chance' but her name is still Tracy :) !!! Call me weird, call me different, but this is a kind of love that some people will never have the privalige of understanding!
