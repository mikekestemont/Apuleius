pay off when we are actaully there.
I just got off work from the Gizzap and I really have nearly nothing to do. Lindsey's working and that brings very sad times in which I am sad at times. I think I will become the president and make it a law that she has to see me all day everyday.&nbsp; We spent all day Saturday together up in Springfield with Jef and Chelsea where we went ice skating and shopping. It was cool shiz. I like pizza. I wish I could spend that much time with&nbsp;her more. Well dudes, I will make like a flamin - and - go. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stin
I am so bored! I wish Lindsey was home. I would love to hang out with her as always. I wish we could just go to random things right now. I love doing that with her; well I would love to do anything with her actaully, she is so fun. She is working right now. She was at my house earlier but since she left I just did random stuff. I went to Wal-Mart to get some milk and then I went to Music 4 Less and got the new Coheed &amp; Cambria cd. It's good, muy bien.
I have been working my butt off lately and so has Linz. Today is hour 6th month marking. How cool is that? I think it is pretty cool. I am so happy to be with her, and I hope it last so many more 6 months. I would never want to lose her infact.
Aloha. What's up dudes? I am just chillin' here after falling asleep for a second becaues I worked from 5 A.M. until 2 P.M. Lindsey got her first job, and I think that is awesome, I am proud of her. I hope I get to see her tonight, she work and the babysits so.......
As for  the Darkness's  Permission to Land...  it's pretty good. It' s no Howie Day but it has a couple of really good tracks. Tambien,  if you like guitar soloationism it's really good. That seems the be in every song. From 1 to 10 I would give it a six....mix...lix...trix...are for kids...I'm done.
I just got the new Coheed and Cambria compact discolation called  In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3.  It is very good, and for some reason the drums really catch my ear. All who read this (being not a single human being in the world) should download it and if you think you might get in trouble (puss) you should go buy it.  &nbsp; EL STIN
