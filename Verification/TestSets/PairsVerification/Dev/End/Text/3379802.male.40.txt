Like today I noticed that a lot of the Iraqi police were now wearing black kevlar helmets. That's new. I remember when we first got to Iraq almost a year ago, a lot of the Iraqi police didn't even have uniforms, just a baseball hat and an AK47. Now they wear slacks, work shirts, bulletproof vests with the words POLICE written in yellow Arabic, they carry brand new AK47's and Glock 9mm pistols and they drive around in new white police cars and trucks. I'm noticing Internet cafâ€š's one by one popping up on every street. New stores opening up. Billboards. Satellite dishes on rooftops, that were non-existent awhile ago. Things are slowly improving for these people out here ."  The link is in the title of this post.
Wonder if the leftist elite media will even mention this?  The first ever pro America film festival. Right here in Dallas. Never been big on film festivals but this is one I'll have to attend.  Wonder if the big fat lazy white pig michael moore will be there?
Charlie Daniels Angers Arab Community..  Awe..That's terrible. Bunch of ragheads angry because they are what they are? Oh well... No use crying over spilt camel shit.  The song starts with,  "This ain't no rag, it's a flag and we don't wear it on our heads. It's a symbol of the land where the good guys live. Are you listening to what I said?"   So what's the problem?   "Someone who is trying to get popular through bigotry, bias and hatred should not be welcome, especially in a city like Dearborn with its rich diversity," Imad Hamad, regional director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, told the Detroit Free Press.     Think I should start the American-American Anti-Anti American Committee. Thats the ticket. Better fire up a new blog.  I'm outta here.
Heard this guy on the Mark Davis show that I listen to daily. He is part of a group that preys on child internet predators. Their moto? "As Long As Our Children Aren't Safe From Predators... Predators aren't safe from US.".  Outstanding! So all the pervs cruising for kids will have to think twice before acting. Entrapment? Nope. All they do is pose as kids and wait to be approached, they initiate no contact with anyone. Kids contacting kids? No Problem. An adult has no business in a chat room full of kids in anything other than a administrator/content monitor.  I know I don't want another adult chatting up my daughter when she's in a room talking with her school friends.  These guys rock.
The Frenchurian Candidate's Band of Brothers isn't exactly a band... More like a solo brother. I wouldn't consider one out of nineteen an overwhelming support base.
We can only hope this is realized. Just think...no more annual headaches about tax returns. No more socialist security will be extorted from your check every month. We would actually get to keep what we work for. Now thats a concept I could sign on to.
Gotta love it! Heres the new moniker for John F'n Kerry.  Rush Limbaugh is a g
