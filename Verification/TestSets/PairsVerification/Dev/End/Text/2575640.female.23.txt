always saying things like "You're so cute, I could just eat you up."  Though I am sure ugly children are just as healthy but I guess it would be rude to point out that a child was ugly.
Well, working is getting to be more and more rewarding.  I had been a little worried (Like tear your hair out and call your boss at three in the morning to say you would like to quit) but I think I am feeling better about the whole thing now.  Though there are many steps to go before I will be doing a good job at my job, I am at least over the fear of it.  And that means anything is possible.  Which makes me very happy. On a side note I am house-sitting for a friend this week and very excited to be doing it because it means that I get to use her little yard... Which has a grill and you know what that means; eating more than my weight in grilled stuff!  We make portabellos soaked in olive oil and vinegar stuffed with spiced feta, roma tomatoes stuffed with spiced goat cheese, vidalas crisped and carmalized on the edges, banana's and blueberries hot from the grill with fresh whipped cream...  Yummy, I can't wait! John and I finally went to see HP3 last night.  I loved it, especially the Hippogriff.  And the boy who plays Ron is just so fantastic...  He is so consistently funny, I love it.  I want more!
Any minute now I am going to catch up with the world around me.  However, I wont hold my breath in the mean time. Have you seen a movie called "A Beautiful Mind"?  How fantastic was that?  It just proves my theory that if your really good at math then you must be crazy.  (this includes my brother Jack, though he isn't exhibiting any signs yet, he still has time.)  No, really, the movie was fantastic.  I was utterly convinced, I lived in John Nash's head the whole way through.  Superb!  This also reminds me how much I love netflix.  It has changed my life, which is why I may catch up to the Modern World any second. (Watch out!) I hope that made sense to someone... If it didn't, rent the movie, you don't have to like math for it to be very good. At any rate, I am still feeling good about work, and if people keep saying yes then I am on the road to success.  I've only just taken a few steps but I am out there and I am going.  Today I actually get to take one of my new clients to the court house to get all the licensing in order.  It is very good to do it today as my weeks end on Tuesdays so it will count toward last week.  (Which is very confusing, don't ask how I keep up.) I hope you all had a good holiday and ate way too much and saw lots of fireworks go boom-boom in the s
