when our family grew both times. He got to see Morgan and Brianne both on the day they were born.  I could devote a posting every day for months telling stories about what we did over the years. The trips on the Cascade Loop, driving the Mazda to the Grand Canyon for spring break, driving that same Mazda into the Pacific Ocean, football Sunday mornings at Sporty's Beef & Brew, driving to Kesselring's to see Bob "the gun pimp", replacing the alternator in Jay's car at the rest area and the ensuing "cat fiasco", Thanksgiving dinner with Socrates and Ripple, shooting at the Kenmore gun club, Christmas mornings in Seattle when our families were in the Midwest, playing pool with the old men on Father's day at the house, sitting around lamenting about the trouble with women in college, and after college, and yesterday...

Really funny stuff over there at  urlLink IMAO!   Know Thy Enemy: Facts about Democrats is one of Frank's best -- enjoy!
Wow, it's been awhile since I've been able to use my computer for anything other than holding down papers when I've got a fan on.  I had so much crap on my hard drive that my system was constantly crashing.  I have very little computer know-how (I can turn it on and deftly maneuver a mouse, no more) so I had to call in a friend to bring the wood to the virus infection.  My browser was being "hi-jacked" and I kept getting redirected to some stupid "home page".  No matter how many times I changed the internet settings, it never went away.  I finally gave up, deleted internet explorer and installed netscape navigator.  So far, so good.  If I ever meet the idiot that wrote that crap, I'm kicking him in the junk.  If it was a female writer, I'll just call her nasty names and tell her she looks fat in her outfit.  Anyway, it's nice to be back.  Lot's of stuff happening now at work, I fly to Minneapolis on Tuesday for my final round of interviews for a promotion.  Politicians don't go through this kind of scrutiny, but I'm enduring.  If I get through this one, the rewards will be sweet.  My roomie is recovering from her surgery quite nicely and is itching to get her energy back.  I think that's a good sign.  Initially, she didn't even  want  her energy back, so we're improving.  Jazz has made herself a part of the family.  I've taken her with me to the folk's and they're quite smitten with her.  The kids are gearing up for school and I think Lisa may even be ready to get back to teaching.  I'm looking forward to seeing Morgan and Brianne this weekend and hitting the zoo.  If you've never been to the zoo in Omaha, we've got a great one...  Anyway, that's all for now.  Barring a renewed assualt from the virus/spyware clowns, I'll be writing more frequently.  Go C
