I have never written anything like it before... but than again, I haven't really written much.
Alright, here we go... A little about me..  My name, Dilon Buser... I live in Del City, OK. I grew up mostly on the outskirts of Norman, out by Lake Thunderbird. I went to school in Moore, where I was in both the Jr High, and High School Band. I was on the drumline thru both, and absolutely love marching percussion. I taught Noble High's Drumline last summer, and hope to be involved again this year. I absolutely love the Dave Matthews Band... have been a fan since '97, and have been, I guess what you could call obsessed since about 3 years ago. Right about the time I started learning to play guitar. Yes, I play guitar, taught by myself, with a little help from some friends. For the most part though, all by myself.... I wanted to be able to play music, and being a percussionist, well, let's just say that I was limited by what I could play. Anyway, I have taught myself, and have been able to develop it further by playing with my Church Band. I started attending the Crown Center in Moore about a little over a year again... I was going thru some hard times, and some real depression, and needed a way out...I found God. Well enough that I wanted more, and stuck around. I think that playing with the band has helped me stay around longer than I thought I would have, but whatever the reason, I am still there....well kinda. WE moved into a new building so I guess it isn't in Moore anymore. BUT YOU GET THE IDEA. Other that all of this, not much to know about me.... oh I can't believe I almost forgot. I LOVE HOCKEY. About, wow...five years ago, a close friend of mine got me into it. I couldn't even stand on skates.... Barely the quads, muchless the inline skates... Quite funny I am sure it was... I didn't think so, but everyone that laughed must have. Anyway, I got good enough to join and team and started playing Inline Hockey in norman. I played there for about 2 years I think... Then I found the mother load of hockey, well atleast around here, ICE. I am so much a better ice skater that I was at inline. It took a while to adjust to the different environment, but I love it. I played all the time up until about a year ago, when work took most of my time. I still want to get out an play occasionally. Anyway, that is all I can think of for now...
Well this is the first time I have ever even thought about a blog. I have gotten from a few friends, that it is good for getting some things out. I don't know who will read this, or if anyone will....but we'll see if helps or not. SO.... anyway... that is it for now... gotta jet and meet Jeff for lunch.  D
