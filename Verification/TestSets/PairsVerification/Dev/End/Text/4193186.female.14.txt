Feeling as though I'd done something productive with my time (I donâ€™t get that gratification out of television), I tried once again to get to sleep, after peeking at the kitchen clock (4:00). Duuuudddeeeeeee there is nothing more boring than lying in bed (couch) and not being able to sleep, and feeling guilty and frustrated about that fact.   Suddenly, I saw the light. Heh! No, I'm serious, it was scary, it looked like the light beam coming from a very large flashlight and it scanned across the living room. My heart started pounding. My throat went dry. My body was as stiff as a board. I was sure that it was some guy trying to break into our house. My head was spinning: should I turn on the television to show the guy- ha! I'm up. Try another house! Not this one. No... bad idea, very, very bad idea. I will just stay still, it is probably nothing, I'll wait 5 minutes, I told myself. It was completely silent, all I could hear was my heart, and any other small noise I detected made me nervous and sounded suspicious. I looked across the downstairs at the front door, and the windows. Why didn't I close the stupid curtains? AHHHHH, now as long as my eyes were open they went straight to the windows and all I could imagine was seeing a stupid face on the other side of the glass, with a stupid hand, tapping on the glass. Tap, tap, tap. I was sinking, and trying to make myself miserable. So, to avoid this little hallucination, I shut my eyes, tight, and forced myself not to open them...  The next time I opened them it was morning, and the sun was shining through the sliding back doors. I am such a dork.  I never intended for that to be so long. Promise.
Hello! So.... technically this new "idea" of mine to have a website, is, well, a scam, since I basically ripped off the idea from Tash, who just showed me her recently constructed website last night. Anyway, I thought that it was a neat way to let you in on the "haps" of my life, and so that all of you, who are constantly yelling at me for my lack of correspondence, will: a.) get a life (j/k), and b.) will now have a new, quick, direct link to me =). Feedback and comments are much appreciated, because otherwise I will feel like I'm just talking to myself. Not cool. I also request that this web address should remain... private? Confidential? I mean, I don't mean to sound so serious, but I am not interested in revealing my private life to total strangers, nor would I wish for anyone to be offended from anything I may confess/discuss in my postings. I'll try my best to update these postings as often as possible. But bear with me, for I am once again, setting myself up for a lot of people to get angry at me due to lack of contact.  Thanks!!! K
