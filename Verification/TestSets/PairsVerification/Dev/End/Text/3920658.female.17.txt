they want Robim to themselves. Sould I ask them now, or do I wait until Robin's already here before I tell them, to embarase them more?  ~:~  This Saturdy it was the big Gay Pride Parade through town. Me and my cousin Jennifer went to the parade area and met Tom and Linda who were already there, and we decided to jump into the parade. As the parade mas starting to march we got a bit confused though: Which people were we supposed to march with? See, the parade consisted of different groups with separate banners marching together. So which group? We soon found out we belonged neither to "Disabled Gay-people", "Gay-doctors of Sweden", "Gay Scouts" or "Christian Gay Movement". Of course Linda and I should've marched with "Proud friends of homosexuals", but Tom couldn't walk alone, could he? Finally we jumped in with a group of cheery transvestites behind a huge pink bus playing disco hits.  When we were dancing around in the streets, some of the people in the parade started shouting my name. I moved forward and shouted "Yes! What?". "They're looking for you!" they replied, and pointed toward two guys standing among the huge group of cheering spectators crammed up on the sidewalks. I immediately recognized them: It was my friend Josie's brother John and her best friend Jim. They looked so baffled to see me marching in the parade I couldn't help laughing. I couldn't get to them so we just waved to eachother, and when I turned around after we'd passed them they were still staring at me. Haha, now they think I'm a lesbian... I might have to explain myself to Josie the next time we meet.  ~:~  Kisses
Le Sud, performed either by Nino Ferrer or excellent french reagge group Zebda, has been the soundtrack of my life lately, and it's been a bit like the song: Sunny, slow and summery. Since both My and Nicole is away, it's only me and Ellen left of  urlLink  Th e Klick    in town, but we're handling it really good. We've been out biking, nightbathing, baking and tomorrow we'll go shopping. Oh, I forgot, I'm broke. Shit. During the rest of the year I live and shop with the study grant, but during the summer there's no school and no cash. It's a hard knock life...  Today was a bit more PMS:ish and not exactly as pleasant as usual, but I lived through it and even managed to get some things sorted out for my driving practise application which I'm supposed to mail tomorrow. I'm longing for the time when I'll start practising driving with my mum, i'm sure I'll learn fast. I wonder how fast I can get a license, though? My biggest dream right now is being able to buy an old  urlLink  VW-van   and go touring around Europe the next summer with my friends... Sigh, I guess I'll have to keep dreaming for a while... But if you happen to have an old but working VW-bus for sale, let me know. Right?  ~:~  K
