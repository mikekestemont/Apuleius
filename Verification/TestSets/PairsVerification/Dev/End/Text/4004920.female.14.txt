got some new  under armour  at dicks. & a fiddlestix set!    oh man fiddlestix is so fun.     at the mall i got a yellow polo from american eagle. i like it.    then when i got home i went for a run &amp; forget what else i did..?    yeah it must not be anything important.     &nbsp;   today i went back to dicks & the mall.    at dicks i got a new bookbag. it reminded me about school. :-\    but oh well, i like it!    &amp; then at the mall i got new running shoes. they're yellow!&nbsp;    yeaaah. then i went over to  kathleen's  house. &nbsp;    she's on a hot sort of blind date right now. I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR ABOUT IT!!     &nbsp;   ♥
so today i realized that i think i'm over a certain somebody.  it's very refreshing to be able to move on.   i did nothing again today.  whatever. i like being lazy.   kathleen gets home tomorrow! then we can hang out at the empty belmont pool all day & get tan for the rest of the summer. funnnn.  &hearts;
i haven't done anything all day. blaaah. somebody call me.&nbsp;     got back from&nbsp;lacrosse camp yesterday. four days goes by really fast.  i got a little bit better, i guess..&nbsp;i learned a bunch of new tricks! haha.&nbsp;i doubt&nbsp;i'd go to the same camp though. the counselors were good &&nbsp;everything, but it wasn't really advanced enough.  i still had&nbsp;a lot of&nbsp;fun though.. crazy times! haha, like when roya&nbsp;& kait were running around in their towels 'cause me &amp; sip&nbsp;stole their keys & locked their&nbsp;door! ;) you guys know it was funny.  &nbsp;  ♥
k, i'm not writing in this anymore.      i'm not the kind of person that wants everyone to know how i'm feeling.   so i'm keeping to my livejournal.      bye.
this weekend has rocked sooo much.    friday night kathleen spent the night.   we had pizza and then we went to coldstone.   birthday cake remix!   thennn we went to the  new  target.   oh boy, did we have fun in there! haha. we watched  stand by me  that night. best movie ever. then saturday kathleen & i went to the mall.   got some good deals there!    kaitie called me like 83902 times while i was gone, so i called her back when i got home &amp; we went to the pool.   after that we went camping.   we roasted marshmallows & made s'mores. and i actually got on an ATV driven by kaitie quigley. that was just a little bit scary. and we swam in the river. and i learned how to fish! haha. except we didn't catch anything.    tonight was the  GIN BLOSSOMS CONCERT !!!   the end was so much fun. ahh. good times.    everyone that didn't go- you missed out  !      two of my best friends helped me  realize  something this weekend.   there are certain things that your  true  friends just don't do to you.    &amp; when people that are any kind of friend to you do that, they apologize.   at least once. if not many times.    kait &amp; kathleen, i love you both tons.
