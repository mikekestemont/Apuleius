loud music . (wasn't a hangover) i was hoping for an IM or email or something from her, with some absolving reason why she never made it (or at least called) but no. (even though  urlLink Trillian  logged that she had signed on at 3 AM)  finally a little bit ago she signed on and I messaged her. the convo was as follows...    Jim: hey Sharon: hi  Jim: whats up? Sharon: I'm not interested in seeing you anymore jim Jim: why? Sharon: Because I sense that you want a commitment and I don't Jim: ok... you couldn't have told me this yesterday before i was expecting you over? i was worried something had happened Sharon: ok Jim: i never asked you to commit to anything Jim: it seemed like we were having a good time together Sharon: we were... Jim: but? Sharon: But,  Jim: honestly, why aren't you interested? Jim: is it something i said/did? Sharon: no...it's not anything you said or did Jim: at least tell me for my own god Sharon: you are a good guy Sharon: I think we're on different levels... Sharon: I'm still a bit up and down/moody Sharon: You are all chill  Jim: c'mon please don't give me these vague excuses. just be honest with me, ok? Sharon: Bc jimbo...I don't think I can connect with you anymore than I haver Sharon: have Sharon: I think this is as good as it gets with you Jim: how so? Sharon: there are other men whom I have made stronger connections with Jim: fine. that's all i needed to hear Jim: can i ask one thing though? Sharon: what's that Jim: were you intimate with this guy before/during our encounters? Sharon: nope...I don't have sex with every guy I meet Jim: so why did you string me along if you knew you were just gonna tell me this anyways? Sharon: I didn't know  Sharon: I didn't string you along...I didn't use you Sharon: I'm just learning these things  Sharon: learning through experience Jim: so you realized this sometime yesterday? Sharon: yep Jim: why did you say you would stay over then? Sharon: Cuz I was scared of your reaction Jim: how so? Sharon: I don't know Jim...I guess I just think worst case scenario  Jim: so what is it about this guy that is so good? Jim: well hey whatever. i knew it wouldn't last forever so no big deal. i just wish you could've been honest about it instead of letting me feel like an ass waiting for you to show up. no hard feelings. Jim: take care. good luck with everything. i hope you find whatever it is you're looking for Sharon: you too Jimbo   To quote  urlLink The Wedding Singer ...  Robbie: Once again, Things that could have been brought to my attention YESTERDAY!  FUCKING A! fucking broads are so fucking frustrating. it's back to a life of celebacy and internet porn for me. i guess i should've listened to  urlLink Dre  when he  urlLink said ...   BITCHES AIN'T SHIT BUT HOES AND T
