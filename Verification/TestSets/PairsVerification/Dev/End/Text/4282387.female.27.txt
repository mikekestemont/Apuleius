lived in the house that Sam grew up in!!....so I had to sneak in, and we went to the room that had been his while he was growing up....ha!  We ended up fucking that night, and it was one of the funnest night I've ever had!  I had on knee high, black high-heeled boots, as it was winter, and I kept those on while we had sex...Sam's cock is really long, although not very thick....but wow, is it wonderful!  We started out on the couch...he licked my wet pussy until I was about to go crazy.  Then, we went to the bedroom, laid on the bed (me w/ my boots still on!!)  Sam laughed at me, and said, you're going to keep those on?  Haha!  We had wonderful sex--Sam talks a lot , he says yeah, and oh I love how you ride my cock, oh you ride it so good....yeeeeeah, yyyyeah!  I loved it, he talks just right!   Oh yeah, he says, 'fuck me' a lot too.  God, just thinking about it turns me on!  So we went two rounds before falling asleep wrapped in each other's arms....see, the weird thing about Sam is, I just get such a warm, cozy feeling with him!  I mean, it's really strong....when I lay next to him, I just feel like I can't get close enough to him!  I snuggle in and snuggle in, and it always seems like maybe I can get just a little bit closer!  And it was even like that on the first night.  (with Ray, it's not like that at all!)  I've really only had that feeling w/ two other guys that have been in my life, that I can remember...and they are guys that I ended up falling in love with.  OH yeah--I don't usually kiss them first, either...I've only kissed first the same two guys, the ones that I fell in love with.  I just don't usually get the urge first, usually it's them who move in to kiss first.  So I woke up at about five a.m. (boots still on!), and I was sweating up a storm...so I took the boots off, and my moving around woke him up....so we went another round.  Morning sex is my favorite....it wakes you up, gets your blood flowing....it was just as awesome in the morning, and I was very impressed that he was able to go three times in one night, at 44 (he was 44 at the time).  His hard ons are really hard, too....man, it's been way too long since I've seen him (I last saw him in....I have to think for a minute.....April, maybe?..or May?)!!  Sex with him is just pretty much perfect....everything is there!      .....it was strange, though, when I woke up....I was looking at him, and noticed that some of the hairs on his chest are gray....and just realized that he's the oldest person I've ever been with...there's almost as much difference in age between he and I as there is between my son and I!!   Welp that is it for today...more t
