a Bush supporter. Both are disgusting occupations frowned upon by the Lord Almighty, who hates greed, selfishness, idiocy, and Jorge Posada. Let's look closely. The Yankees make more money than everyone else; so do Republicans. By fighting against a salary cap, the Yankees ensure that there remains an unlevel playing field so that no one can challenge their dominance; so do the Republicans. The Yankees plunder their own farm system annually in order to make trades to win the World Series, giving little thought to the state of the franchise in a few years. Bush raids our nation's treasury and environment for gain now rather than leaving something for the next generation. The Yankees win when they don't win; remember the little boy who gave Derek Jeter's fly ball to the warning track in the '96 ALCS a little boost into the stands? The little boy should have been forced to wash his hands of his crime with Yankee Stadium toilet water, but instead he was exalted as a hero. We all know how Bush wins when he doesn't really win; he, too, has not been forced to cleanse himself of his crime, and not because he can't find enough vestigial Clintonian discharge lying around the White House to do the job.  There are similarities between the people on both teams. Jason Giambi and Rush Limbaugh are practically identical twins, sharing equatorial waistlines and drug addictions. Paul O'Neill and Dick Cheney are alike in that they are both completely insane. They should both be put into lion cages at the zoo and see how long it takes for all the lions to be dead. Condoleeza Rice is a young Don Zimmer, in that neither of them has any clue what's going on. Joe Torre is like Colin Powell, a good man who's been caught working for a bad cause. But George Steinbrenner is definitely like George Bush, arrogant, condescending, without any foundation for his innate sense of superiority and entitlement. Neither cares that they are ruining things for everyone else.  Now, I understand that some support the Yanks because they were born in New York. It's OK to be a Yanks fan, as long as you're not a fan. Which is to say, don't be obnoxious. Your team is good because they spend 140 million dollars more than the average team, not because it is an absolutely superior franchise. It's like rooting for a twenty-year-old to beat a five-year-old in a fight. You know that in fifteen years, the kid could beat the twenty-year-old, but now he has no chance.  And I understand that some are born Republicans. Tha's OK, too; it can't be helped. But to support Bush, when he and his goons are undermining everything that is good about our country, is hardly justifiable.  With any luck, the Yankees will be playing in the World Series in November and will lose, causing all Bush supporters who root for the Yankees to stay home on election day because of their depression. It could happen, unless that little bastard cheats a
