on a Saturday afternoon in Sec3 or Sec4? And still all enjoy each others' company to the fullest.  My point is,&nbsp;4S2 is still intact to a large extent and is still evolving.&nbsp; It didn't disintegrate.  4S2 is&nbsp;more like some popular TV show who's series has ended and all the actors move on to other projects&nbsp;and there is a spinoff series.  Or the Fellowship of the Ring. Or something that broke up.   In the same way we all have our own lives outside 4S2 now. But are still connected by the fact that once in our lives we were all together in the same container class.  Ok. Enough of metaphors.And one more thing: I don't think we can ever fully appreciate our lives until they've become the past. 4S2 was often&nbsp;terrible while we were&nbsp;actually in it.&nbsp;Though i guess&nbsp;sometimes not.  All thanks to CCS for organizing all the gatherings and the people who invented SMS and blogs
hey.. came across this fwd email so just wanna share it with you people.  - Everyday when you return from your school, whether or not it is from a secondary school, a junior college, a polytechnic, or ITE, you would probably think that school sucks.   All that work and torture under your lecturer's or teacher's homework or assignments, or tutorials...   But think about this, all the time spent with your classmates, all the laughter, sorrows, and happiness of knowing that your friends are there in your class.   Now imagine them gone, perhaps part of them or even all of them. You may not realise it, but when advancing into the next level of education, it is inevitable that some friends will be parting with you.   What is all this you ask yourself, what I ask is of you to think, for those who received this mail, what do those people who were once or were still your classmates and friends meant to you.   Anyone who has at least finished their o levels and has graduated from respective schools would know the feeling of parting with your classmates and friends.   Not knowing when you still see them again.   Perhaps the next day, the next week, month, years, or even decade. Perhaps one day, you would realised how bitter sweet those memories were, the fun you had with your classmates and friends.  That is why ever so often when you asked someone which is the most fond memories they had in their years in education, they would often have that sadness in their eyes, but yet, they smile briefly.   It's the memories of their school friends. Those unforgettable years of laughter and happiness in school.   Each classmate had suffered under the same stresses in school. The teachers, whether they are kind or extremely strict.   So treasure your schooling days, don't complain, because you never know when you will miss them dearly. And perhaps, shed a tear for those treasured times in your youth.
Somehow, I'm sad to see this blog become redundant. Where's everyone? Come back to meeeeeeeeeeeeee. I want my classmates back! Barbarians, pot of gold, where are y
