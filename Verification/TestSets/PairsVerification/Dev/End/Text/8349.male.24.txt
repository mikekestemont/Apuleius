Player of choice for me.
Thank you,  urlLink Engadget  for making my day with this choice quote: "Most people still have absolutely no idea what in the hell we’re talking about when we bring up Voice over IP (which is why we’ve long since abandoned it as a pickup line)."  It's the simple things in life right?
Ahhh one of my ultimate favorite trends of the 80's(and continuing on i may add) was the breakdance trend.  I could watch hours and hours of this stuff.  Luckily there appears to be  urlLink Renaissance of Breakin' .
