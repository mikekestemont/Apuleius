okay. i hate my little sister. she's got this whole jessica simpson's little sister obsession going on, and contantly playing that pieces of me song. it bugs the hell out of me! oh well. but summer is such a drag. i'm wanting to go to nevada soooooo bad. i know. nevada? why the hell there? i really dont know, but it's the only place that i can stay for free. but i dont know, i'm getting so sick of boise, it's so boring here, i've lived here for my whole life practically, and it's just a drag anymore, and there is SO much drama. too much actually. i'm just wanting to start over, i want new people in my life, people that dont know about my past, and that they'll accept me for me, not the old justine.
