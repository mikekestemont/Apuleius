There's even a game where you get to eat democrats and republicans!   urlLink Candidate Zero's Blog   And I also must mention that I'm pretty sure CZ is on VH1's A to Z - not as CZ, but as himself, a comedian.  Unfortunately, VH1.com doesn't seem to thing that people need to know anything about the commentators on any of their shows.  Thanks a lot, jackasses.
Davenport!  What the hell?  How can you let THREE banks be robbed in one day, no less a day when two presidential candidates are in town?  And how could you let it be the three most rinky dink places in town, including that little hole by Jo-Ann's (which sucks anyway - that store is just no good)?  And how could you let my arch nemesis MATT LAUER tell me about it?  Davenport, I think I hate you.  And Charlie Brooke, I think I hate you too.  What is going on with your head?  It looks very strange.  During this time of The Great CD Challenge, we have to consider the wants and needs of our listeners, mainly me.  And this listener has made an unprecedented decision.   I am going to listen to the Stellastarr CD all day BECAUSE I CAN.  And because I really like it.

It turns out that I'm a total liar.  I didn't have an Excel class Thursday and Friday.  I never intended on visiting Abby this weekend.  Instead, my dad and I have been plotting a surprise birthday visit to Iowa for my mom.  I took the train home on Thursday, and I'm about to leave pretty soon.   It was a really good weekend filled with fart spray, shoe sales and a dog with a stinky ear.  I slept a lot and ate a lot of cake (Hy-Vee, I love you).  But I miss my boyfriend and my mouse (in that order), so it's time to go home.  Tomorrow I'll tell you about the near-rumble on the train here.
