worshiped the "One God."  Then my aunt started crying that I was going to go to hell.  However, the funniest part of this whole story is that in all of my 26 years, I have not seen any of them ever attend a church, live a holy life or say anything remotely "Christian".  But then again, I guess the whole basis of Christianity is that as long as you ask for forgiveness, you get to go to heaven.  Oh, and tithing doesn't hurt.

Last weekend (yes, I've been too lazy to upate until now) I went to the Chino Latino to watch my friend Oscar perform drag.  The Chino Latino is a huge dive bar with a very interesting crowd.  Well, they are all Latino, for one.  Second it is a complete mix of straights and gays.  The dance floor is the biggest mix of couples I've ever seen.  It kind of reminded me a perfect world (in that straights and gays lived side by side without any prejudices--oh, and everyone speaks Spanish)  Let's say my roommate's brother, all six-four and white blonde of him really stood out.
Life Update: I’ve been in Chapel Hill twice this week!  Tuesday night we explored with Katka.  We had the worst Margarita ever.  FYI if you go to Banditos just stick to Dos Equis.  Then last night we went to a “going away” thingy for Allen.  In front of the Chapel Hill campus is a huge sun dial.  It’s at least  30 feet in diameter.  Well, Allen, Anja and I are all standing on the sun dial like idiots trying to figure out how the thing works.  Apparently, the students at CH are much smarter then we are; Allen even had instructions printed from the internet.  I definitely feel humbled.  However, we did find some very cool bars.  There is this place called the Lantern and this place called Telulahs.  Telulah’s has a special little room that’s all Haremish.  I also had a great time talking to Ninki and her husband.  ECH Sandwiches: ECH is nice enough to provide their committee meetings with a snack each month.  So it’s 5:00 and I rush on over to the meeting; famished.  They have these cute little sandwiches, so I take one, get seated and get ready to attempt to save a little piece of the world.  I open up the sandwich, take a bite and nearly have to regurgitate what’s in my mouth.  I need to preface this by saying that a lot of people there were chomping away on the sandwiches and I mean no disrespect to ECH, but I would never have dreamed of this combination.  There was a bun and on the bun, an inch of mayo and a half an inch of refried beans with lettuce.  Can I just say, WHAT???
