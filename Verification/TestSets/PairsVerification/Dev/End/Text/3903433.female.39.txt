was surprised they didn't name the "C" storm Clyde... :P If they'd done that, and the timing/positioning of Bonnie had been a little different, why, we'd have the Perfect Storm. :)  The supermarkets must have anticipated a run; I was surprised to walk into Publix and find there were still canned goods available. I had a hurricane store but it was a bit old, and one can exploded some time ago so I thought now was a good time to replace it. The other thing I've been mulling over was a supplier like Survival Instinct for longer term food storage and water filters.  At a time like this, I wish we'd been able to build our dome home.
What a way to start networking. Even though my office still isn't ready yet, I figure it will take time for awareness for my new business to percolate through the bay area so I went to a Network of Executive Women luncheon today in downtown Tampa; the speaker was the mayor of Tampa, Pam Iorio. She is dynamic and engaging in person; this was the first time I've ever met her. In the past, through the Oldsmar Chamber of Commerce, I've had the opportunity to meet Oldsmar mayor Jerry Beverland and House representative Gus Bilirakis.  I didn't have a laptop with me so here are some highlights I jotted down from Mayor Iorio's speech. She is a mother of two teenagers, so she began with some amusing stories on that subject.  She then told one story of government letting the people down; they'd helped a mother with government assisted housing, but years later the neighborhood had been taken over by drugs that she no longer felt it was a safe place for her and her children. She seems committed to cracking down on drugs.  Currently, there isn't much connectivity and activity in downtown Tampa past business hours; high on her priority list is building a Riverwalk to attract more residents. She said the advantage of term limits is that it helps create a sense of urgency for projects like this.  She said she's delivered a budget this year with no increases in spending.  One interesting question someone asked concerned qualitative metrics to assess the effectiveness of new programs. The mayor replied no one had ever asked her that question, and said she could see the results. Having worked in IT, I agree with the questioner that without benchmarks, we could never know the  efficacies of those new programs.  Mayor's biography: http://www.tampagov.net/dept_Mayor/biography.asp  The Network of Executive Women meets the second Tuesday of every month at the Centre Club at 123 S. Westshore.  One of the things I would love to see, but haven't yet had the time to research: a non-partisan website where you could do a look up by zip code, and see a list of all candidates from all levels - national to local: every Democrat, Republican, Independent, etc. candidate along with their voting records.
