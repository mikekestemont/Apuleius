what we ended up doing was completely different than what had originally been planned. instead of watching the fireworks and going to a club, we went to chapters and then grabbed a bite to eat. we rented a movie and decided to make it another late-night sleep over. the movie, although slightly adolescent, was entertaining enough, especially in conjunction with some of may's homemade chai tea and a couple healthy rounds of competitive Crazy 8's. nobody else is as much of a night owl as I am, though, understandably, so bedtime came as soon as the movie had ended.        that was somewhere close to an hour ago. I lay there in the darkness staring up at the ceiliing and I may as well have just drank 5 shots of espresso. there's something weird about not sleeping at home, or maybe it's more like I was just weirding myself out about feeling alone even when surrounded by 3 other people. yeah, I think that's more what it was. a nice dose of that queasy anxiety was rolling around my insides, and it manifested itself into a bit of a crying session. at times like those, I always start thinking to myself, "see, kathleen?!? this is not normal behaviour and I have no idea how it's ever gonna stop." I started snowballing into that all-too-familiar train of thought about how I resent my mom so much for not... fucking raising me better. for leaving me alone as a child, not so much physically (though that did occur as well), but metaphorically. after having looked at those baby pictures the other day that I hadn't seen in forever, it almost makes my disappointment in myself even worse.

I  didn't . somewhere along the line I got fucked up and I let so many things escape me and she didn't do anything to stop it.        any of the good things about me that make up who I am right now, I acquired and developed on my own. it's almost as though she can't take credit for anything about me but getting herself p
