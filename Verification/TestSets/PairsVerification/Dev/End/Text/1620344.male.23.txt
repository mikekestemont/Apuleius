with virtually any consumer good they dont know about.  Who are these Amish people to discriminate against products and goods they dont even know.  This sounds a little bit like the concept of hating people you dont know which most people would say is bad. By implementing a campaign to target the Amish, the primary goal of profits and sales could be realized, while fullfilling a secondary and indirect objective of discouraging discrimination.
I LOVE DOING PHONE SUPPORT
I know there has been a small minority of you want and  waiting  for the westsixth.net blog to become active again. It my pleasure, na- my privilege to re-open the westsixth.net blog to you once again.    In keep with the grand tradition of fine pirate oriented writing I want to share with you some of the tidbits of pirate wisdom that I have had a chance to reflect on this past year:         Treasure chests, while a      great place to store your loot are not always a great place to store      perishable goods.    Pastels are always good, particularly when they are used in a bandana to accentuate your eyes. When used to make pants it can had a festive feeling that lightens the mood of your entire crew.

We also went up the space needle and I managed to hock a luggie off so I was pretty proud of that one. It took a few trys but in the end Jeff was successfull. Well thats all for now, I would have been posting more but I have had very little computer access. Well for all of you many many Westsixth fans take it easy and you will hear from me when I start posting regularly again in a week.
Walter Cronkite had an excellent  urlLink reflection on the   Gulf  of  Tonkin   resolution today on NPR .    Some of the phone conversations that are public now are amazing.       It’s kind of a long piece (20 minutes), but if you have the attention span, I highly recommend you listen to it.    Cronkite raised some excellent comparisons to the current political climate in a way that only he c
