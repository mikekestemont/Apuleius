her for a quarter and as usual she said no.  That shouldn't have been unusual, but I guess the heat must have gotten to the man.  He said "Stupid ho."  She turned around and said, "Excuse me?  I just know you didn't go there."  He said, "Hell yeah, I went there and what are you going to do about it?"  She said, "What makes you think I'm going to do something about it?"
