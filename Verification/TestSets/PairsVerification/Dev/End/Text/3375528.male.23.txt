very successful because it relies on free market business theory. A product that is not marketable does not stay on the consumer market. The viewer has a decision to make when offensive material is broadcast. If the viewer changes the channel then ratings will drop. Advertisers do not get a return on advertising if a show is not watched. Therefore advertisers do not put commercials on shows with poor ratings. The show being unprofitable is either fixed or canceled. Instead of involving the government, the consumers are directly regulating what is on the air.   This method has the added benefit of being the most regulated. Because the consumers are using action instead of complaints, the ability of one group to alter media content becomes marginalized. In the current system if a group complains enough action it taken by the FCC. Indecent or not the FCC will go after a broadcaster if these right wing groups complain enough. By allowing the consumer to right to decide what is decent, the popular desire of the nation is reflected. Shows like Howard Stern and Elliot in the morning remain on the air by this principal. Lots of people do not like the shows, but they are not forced to watch it. If Stern offended his entire audience, he would be removed from the air.  	The reality of the situation is complex. It is a fact if we allow the government to regulate speech in broadcast, the regulations will suppress our right to free speech. By letting the FCC operate illegally the American people are giving up the right to think freely and decided what is decent. Eventually, even more rights erode as governmental agencies become more powerful. Recently there was a vote in congress potentially allowing the FCC jurisdiction over satellite television and radio. If laws such as this are allowed to pass the arms of jurisdiction will encompass all forms of media and expression 	Now is the time to act. Howard Stern has remained on air by open accusing the FCC of operating with a political agenda. He has also gotten support from listeners in reporting the “indecency” of shows like Oprah. Her show talks about the same topics as Stern’s but is not subject to the governmental crack down.   	The freedoms guaranteed in the Bill of Rights some of the most precious freedoms and rights given anywhere in the world. As a result they are constantly under attack as groups try to remove them. The Patriot Act has set the civil rights movement back and caused more harm then it will ever protect. We have to unite as country and be heard. The voices of small advocacy groups and governmental desires are not protected but soon will be if we the majority allow our wants to be marginalized by the minority.
