change.  I'm 23 and I'm currently working at a dead-end job for a really crooked, dumb-ass company (which for the time being, shall remain nameless)...At this job, I do the whole 'technical support thing'.  Helping people day in and day out who treat you like absolute muck and are quite ungrateful (for the most part).  I'm living happily with my boyfriend of 2 years, Nick.  My Mexican Wiener Dog, Chino Moreno, an obese guinea Pig, Sully, and a hamster, Hammish.  Yup, pet central.  Hobbies?  Music.  Music in every way, shape and form.  Music keeps me going.  If Music ceased to exist, then so would I.  Keep in mind though, that I don't always think it would be such a bad thing to cease to exist.  I like weird things, foreign movies with subtitles, music that no one else has heard of, and probably never will.  I don't think any of my dear friends understand me, but I love them all the same.  I'm attracted to scrawny guys, with big hair, tattoos and piercings.  No jocks.  Jocks are yucky.  And, I guess that the last thing I have to say about myself is that I'm plagued by an anxiety disorder that is slowly but surely destroying my life.  Well, I think that about covers it.  I'm out of things to say for now...It looks like rain outside, perhaps thunder and lightning?  Maybe it's time for a walk.
So I think my appendix is acting up again...Actually I think it's on the brink of bursting, but I refuse to go back to the hospital until I am on the brink of death. Why? Because that's what they want. I've gone to the hospital already for sharp, horrible pains in my lower right side and they sent me home after telling me, 'You are having an acute appendicitis attack...we're not going to remove it though, go home, if the pain gets worse, you start running a fever and throwing up, come back...quickly.' Yup, those are the exact words. So here I wait...in pain...for my appendix to burst. Lord I hate people sometimes. So, it seems that my good friend Amy has adapted my habits and is developing an anxiety disorder. Which is not cool. I wouldn't wish this affliction upon my worst enemy. But, maybe now I have someone I can finally relate to in the whole 'crazy department'. It's strange though, Amy never really struck me as the type that would panic easily over anything. In any case, I hope she starts to feel better soon. I also hope her attacks don't become as morbid as mine. Get well soon Amy. Oh, and for the record, I don't hate all Americans. Only the one's who have given me a hard time (which is the majority of the one's I've encountered). I've also had experiences with some very sweet and lovable Americans. Plus, I can't forget to leave out all of the Americans who make the music I can't live without. You're not all bad. Long live the Rock Gods.  I fucking hate my a
