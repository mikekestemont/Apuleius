around 3 with brad and christina. Umm...the party was fun. It was smashed with food, cold beverages, volleyball and a trampoline....but alas! The party ended for myself at 6 when i headed over to the church. Dont get me wrong tho...I love singing for the youth group....but i was ready to hit sumbody when i found out everyone went over to Nicoles house a lil while later...and even tho its 11:30 right now....theyre still there...grr...oh well...It was juss jesse, pat and I at the youth group today but as Im sure u all kno theyre MORE than enuff for a girl like me *wink*    Singing tomorrow for church *hissss* Wish me luck whoever u r....yah u kno who Im talking about...  And remember..."Dont waste another daaaaay!"
Oh man! Do u know what its like to wake up...and find your kitchen and half ur living room SWIMMING in dog urine. I do...and it sucks...  However, the rest of the day wasn't too bad. I went to the pool around 1 and most of Da Gang showed up eventually. It was cool...did a lil swim swim...lil eat eat...a lil...no thats it. We got picked up around 6 and went home..only to leave around 8 to go to charlie Brown's for my brothers bday. My folks wont be here next week for it cuz of their cruise so there u go. Oh man, it was bangin. I never knew there were so many types of steak in one place. I had london broil or whatever in the end. I was too afraid to get a plate of sumthing new. It was cool tho...  Aaaaand now Im over nicoles house for a...SLUMBER PARTY!! Actually shes sleepin now...but its cool...she's still a growing boy afterall.
The movie....for all those that didn't go...wasn't too bad. Infact, yesterday was pretty good all together. I was supposed to go to the pool with nicole but we were too lazy to go anywhere till like 3 or sumthing when our moms + Christina picked us both up to go to the mall. We ate lunch at Ruby Tuesdays (slight mmmm)but I wasn't that hungry. I haven't been very hungry lately. I keep feeling really down about myself...its really irritating. We hung out around the mall for a while. I got a new bathing suit and sum church clothes, including a matching outfet to Nicole.   Then idk...they drove us over to Matt and Juliets where we had dinner. It was cool, their house is REALLY nice and so is their pond....great for spontaniously(sp) jumping into..pretty sick stuff...but it was worth it cuz matt paid for my movie ticket and gave me 7 bucks for snack foods.   Then we got to the movie juss on friggin time...good movie i gotta say. The first one is always better and stuff but this one was different. It had more laughs...yet more drama....the whole thing was pretty much drama....infact most of it juss made u wanna feel sorry for the guy...perhaps thats y i feel so weird today....naah...  Have a nice day everybody...especially u so and s
