up was Central Park.  It's huge.  I took a picture from the Empire State Building that you can see below.  It's very pretty & clean.  I was impressed.  People were out running & walking, just hanging out.  There are lots of little ponds & gardens.  A nice relaxing time.   urlLink    Central Park from the Empire State Building.&nbsp; urlLink     Probably the most comprehensive thing we did was to take a tour around Manhattan island.  It was a 3 hour tour that took you all the way around the island, with a guy pointing things out & telling you stories along the way.  It was really interesting & gave you a good flavor of the island.  Be warned though, make sure to wear sunblock!  I got burnt so bad on my forehead that I blistered the next day.  Ouch!  I'm all healed up now though, so no harm done.  We went to Bronx zoo with some friends from West Point.  It was a neat zoo, but I've seen better.  The trip out was a bit of an adventure, since we went the wrong way on a subway twice.  Oops!  At one point we had to go above ground to change trains, in Harlem!  Kind of scary for a couple of whities from Indiana.  :)  While we were in New York we had our first anniversary.  I can't believe it's been a year already.  In some respects it seems like it went fast, but it also feels like we've been together forever.  Any woman able to put up with me for that long deserves a medal.  I'm thinking a purple heart for our 50th anniversary.  :)  Anyway, we went to a nice dinner down in Little Italy again (which was even better this time).  Then we went to see Rent on Broadway.  Then we decided to pretend we had some money & get a hotel downtown.  All in all, a very nice first anniversary.  Well, I guess that's it for the part of our vacation to New York.  We were there for 4 days all together.  It was a blast and I'd definitely recommend going to anyone interested.  What a great city.  Don't know if I could live there though.  Check back later for the rest of the vacation.  See-ya!
Well, I've finally decided to start myself a little online blog-action.  For those family members out there that may not know exactly what a "blog" is, I suggest checking  urlLink this  out.  By the way, if you ever need to look up something real quick, try out  urlLink WikiPedia , it rocks.  Anyway, I plan on this blog just covering general stuff about Jen & I.  Hopefully you can check back here once in a while and see what's been going on with us.  I'll try and keep my ranting & raving about current events limited to other blogs.  But hey, if you interested in  urlLink what I have to say .  I guess that's it for now.  I'll start blogging our life pretty soon & hopefully you enjoy what I have to say.  S
