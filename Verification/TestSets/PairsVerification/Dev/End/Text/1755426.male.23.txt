or Friday, though I will.  All I can hope is that someone noticed.  The lady checking my stuff said she has been very impressed with my work, aside from the fact that it is mostly wrong and needs to be fixed.  Well, at least she likes my coloring.  I may not post tomorrow night, for if I do indeed finish everything tonight and tomorrow morning, I think a 3-day sleep is on order.  Night.
Tonight I flipped back and forth between Iron Chef (always on at 9pm!) and a show on Discovery about the history of cannibalism.  I got to the point that I was just getting confused on which I was watching.  They really went into some detail about that human stuff...and you know Iron Chef...always some interesting ingredients.  Work is still a pretty rough, but my Mom surprised me with a ticket to Chicago here in a couple of weeks, so that helped a lot!  I am seriously looking forward to that, and maybe I will get to eat at that Cuban restaurant she always talks about.    Anyway, sweet dreams of Thai mystery meat (blech!)
Boy that was a long one. And I am still not done. I should have stayed past 9 but I just couldn't keep my eyes open and staring at that computer screen any longer. Probably try and get in around 6 tomorrow so I can have everything done in time for the person to review it. What is up with this work being work thing? Like they expect me to be on top of things and have responsibility for some dumb reason.  Still in the search for a new car, or a way out of a new car. Stupid money with its stupid green and its stupid paper. Yeah, it needed to be said.  More tomorrow...if I love you as much as you think I do.  Oh, and just because I do love you ...Will Ferrell as George W.
Wow, I think for one of the first times ever this summer I am not going to gush about my perfect weekend.  First things, I ran into some car problems and it is quite possible I will be in need of a vehicle very soon.  Sucky.  Then the money woes kept coming.  A huge electric bill (deposits suck) and a pretty expensive Friday night.  Speaking of Friday night, I am sorry that it turned out the way that it did.  I had a good time, but it probably cost me too much in the end (and more than just in my wallet.)  Encampment was ok.  I had never been there without being put to labor :)  We really didn't do much though, trying to recover from the previous evening.  The moon was incredible though.  Not only was it a blue moon, but it was a harvest moon...glowing orange in the sky.  Very cool.  So this week is studying for my test and trying to figure out how I can pull all of this car/money stuff off for the next few months.  Too bad Ramen isn't in my d
