my new office space. It rocks. Desk chairs are the foundation for which your inner most assistant-ness comes from. It is enormously important that your inner most assistant be comfortable, free to swivel, have good posture, type and ultimately assist. For one to have this healthy inner assistant vibe - ones keester must be propped up in the perfectly designed, ergonomically satisfying, faux leather (pleather) chair. All for $79.99 at your local Office Depot.
Last night I had 2 diet cokes at happy hour. Then I went to Jeff's to do shit loads of laundry while he drank beer(s). It was the test of all tests. My two calming agents: Bud Light and Dryer sheets. I am proud to report -- I took a few deep breaths and succeeded to NOT drink a Bud Light but a few cups of liquid Downey Fabric softener instead. No, that's a lie. I did not drink fabric softer. I didn't drink a beer either. Woo-hoo.
I'm trying to eat healthier: 1/2 of Karyn's egg sandwich on bagel w/large coffee (breakfast), instant oatmeal w/diet Sprite (lunch), and a salad w/low fat dressing, 1 peach and a sugar free Redbull  and one tiny little kit kat bar  (dinner). Not so bad. Tomorrow I'm on to whole wheat bagels with non fat cream cheese, plums, and a Lean Cuisine (maybe 2 Lean Cuisines) ALL with a cup of liquid Downey fabric softener - no I mean water .. bottled water.
I miss my friend Carrie. I sometimes wonder if I'll ever see her more then once a month like the good ole days?!
Ok my attitude is a little better BUT I am dying for a beer. Ugh!! It's only been 2 days. Cory - you're right - exercise is the key. I am doing laundry tonight but maybe the big gym commitment will be tomorrow. I think I might have to smoke a bit....is that bad?

So it's Sunday at 6:55 and I've been in bed all day watching movies. I have had a wild weekend filled with booze, friends and now sleep. Last night at 2am I decided to "dry out". I am going to pretty much stop drinking (and smoking) for a month. I realized last night that I couldn't remember the last time I was sober. I have a few nights this month that might require some social cocktails/champagne. I have a bachelorette party, a wedding, and a bridal shower. Other then that I'm on the wagon and the official DD. I'll let you know how it goes. I am going to get a bagel (thanks Liz) and watch the rest of Bad Santa. So far today I've watched Dirty Dancing - Havana Nights (yes, it was as bad as you knew it was going to be), The Perfect Score (not so bad), and now the rest of Bad Santa. After that I think I'll bathe and then go to bed. I have a fun week of work in my new office! I'll keep you posted on the no-drinking/smoking plan. Maybe I'll chart it somehow or s
