but to write and create...otherwise i will fill up and burst, leaving a heaving mess of entrails and plasma on the floor.  so, i ultimately decided that my need to empty my brain of accumulated thoughts and demons is far more important that following any set of rules and standards that have been designated for my language. therefore, i will continue. those that wish to make suggestions, i will take them gladly and will even welcome the lengthening of my knowledge. however keep in mind that i will retain my self given right to lay aside any and all rules at any time for the purpose of delivering the message of my tiny little voice.  "I" before "E"...except after "C" right?
sometimes even in my insignificance...i feel significant. then that other voice chimes in..."oh no you're not, ass hole. do you have that little friend also? maybe that is why i didn't post yesterday at all...i think i just felt like it really didn't matter...and in reality, it does not matter...I can hear bill murray now...it just doesn't matter...it just doesn't matter...(that was from the movie  meatballs , in case you didn't know.)  last night me and my slight little wine buzz were watching a show about reporters at war. which is probably the one thing i wish i could do or be...if i had my choice of life assignments i would have been a photographer on the beaches on Normandy during D-day...or i would have been a photographer in Saigon when all hell broke loose on the morning of the TET offensive...but that's just me...crazy, i know, the doctor already told me...well actually all the women in my life told me, the doctor just smiles and nods while he takes notes.  anyway...on this show i was watching...they were interviewing a woman reporter that was in Viet Nam in 1970-72...they asked her if she regrets going there...she replied..."yes, of course i do!" she went on do describe the wonderful life she thinks she might have now if she had never gone...then she said... "we have to get over the notion that our stories really make a difference. for all the words i've written, i have very little." then she took a long draw off her cigarette...  that remark hit me hard...we all want to believe that we make some difference even if it is in some small way...then to see this woman that was cast into the hell of war not knowing that the ultimate casualty would be herself.  makes me think... at what cost, victory. not the war of armies and nations...the war and risk of the soul to be someone or do something...significant.
a few words about hope...  falling slowly through the cold rain i land among the other brown leaves where i lay anonymous holding my damp embers of hope. in the gray light where the most ancient of lovers touch in the silence i push my breath across the embers believing that she is out there wandering among the trees looking for a brown leaf exactly like me.
