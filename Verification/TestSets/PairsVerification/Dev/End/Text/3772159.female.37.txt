week.  We had a ball.  Lots of shopping, a little football (did I mention we are both big Australian Rules Football fans?) and an awful   lot of sightseeing.  On our return we continued dating, mainly going to events at the football club (GO YOU MIGHTY DEMONS!!!!!) and out for dinner and various things.  In September we considered moving in together.  Our plan was to start living together around Christmas time, but events occurred which made it a case where we started to live together immediately.  The house I had been living in was way too small for what we needed so we rented a bigger house.  I had been living alone up until June when my daughter Rebecca (11) decided to move back home from her fathers house.  All of a sudden we were a household of 3.  In around November 2003, my son Joel (16) decided to move back in with me from his fathers house, our household was expanding rapidly.  Then Amanda (14) decided to spend the Christmas school holidays with us, our 3 bedroom house was showing major indicators of being way too small for us.  March 2004 saw Amanda (who had by now turned 15) decide that it was more pertinent for her to live with us fulltime so it was time to find yet another larger house.  We still had one outstanding child Nathan (11) and it was decided that we needed a house that would accomodate all that were already living at home plus a room for Nathan just in case.  We tried to get finance to buy a home but without fudging the figures there was just no way we could be considered for finance, and if we did fudge the figures there was a good chance that we would not be able to afford the repayments.  So back to the rental market we went.  We looked at 3 or 4 houses but most of the houses in the rental sphere were too small for our rapidly growing family.  Then the property manager (thanks Colleen) that had found us our original rental told us of a large house that she had on the market, we thought that perhaps the rent was a little exorbitant but decided to look anyway.  Colleen showed me through and I rang Jim at work and told him that we just had to have this house, it is massively huge.  5 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, study, massive lounge and dining area.  He told me if I was so in love with it to immediately put in an application to rent the property.  I did this and when Jim saw it 3 days later he fell in love too.  In the meantime, Jim had proposed to me and we decided to get engaged at Christmas time.  We announced our engagement to family and friends on the 19th of December 2003 and had a lovely party at Jim's mothers house on 22nd January 2004.  The guest list for this party is essentially the guest list we will be working on for the w
