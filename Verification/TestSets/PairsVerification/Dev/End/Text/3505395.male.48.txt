“Thank you for being a part of the dream.”  The lights then go up and people begin to stand up and disperse.  At no point in the service was money mentioned or an offering taken.  The visitor absolutely will notice the absence of condemnation, authority or financial appeals, and he or she will be both puzzled and pleased.  Hardly anyone will leave the church facility before at least a half-hour of visiting after the service.  The announcements video at the end of the service invited them to numerous opportunities throughout the week for prayer times, Bible studies, breakfasts and shopping or sporting events.  If not after their first visit, certainly after a second visit someone will invite the visitor out to eat, and to one of the other events during the week.  We will deliberately work at developing a personal relationship with the visitor, with no ulterior motive beyond making them feel loved and valued.  If we do that well enough, we’ve found that the Holy Spirit does the rest.  If we love someone long enough, deeply enough, genuinely enough and safely enough, at some point they come under such deep conviction, and such deep desire for forgiveness, that they will confess all their sins and accept the Author of love, as counter-intuitive as that sounds.  If real love for real people is not our motive for doing something, we don’t do it.  No one preaches, teaches, sings or greets out of duty or ego needs.  In fact, we rotate every ministry in the church.  Someone other than the pastor preaches once a month.  The music team and worship leader take turns, as do the teachers, cleaners and so forth.  If someone tells us they won’t be at church next Sunday because they’re doing something else, we say: “Great! Have a good time!”  People come to church because they want to, not because they have to.  The result is a new generation of Nazarenes.  They know what we believe, why we believe it and where we came from.  We don’t take an offering, but the people give sacrificially.  We don’t have adult Sunday School classes on Sunday, but the people joyfully meet in small groups through the week to explore God’s word and disciple each other.  We don’t flaunt titles, but the pastor is loved, respected and effective.  We don’t have a paid staff, but we have full-time associate pastors.  We don’t have a local structure we call NYI or NMI, but we have teens planning on going to Nazarene colleges, adults building relationships with Nazarenes in other countries, eager to do church planting in other countries, and enthusiastic about our financial commitment to the World Evangelism Fund and other denominational budgets.  Wesleyanism makes infinitely more sense to this generation than Calvinism or Catholicism or any other major religious system.  The Church of the Nazarene was raised up to be God’s agent in the developed world in the 21st Century.  We have the message.  This is our time.  We can change the world.
