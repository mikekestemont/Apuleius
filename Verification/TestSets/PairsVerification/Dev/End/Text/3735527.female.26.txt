drinking the stuff.. otherwise, you're shit out of luck.   BUT - this is how damn clever I like to think i am - I managed to organise the dinner on the last night of football in Sydney - missing the cruicial Sydney v Essendon match.  It'll be an absolute cracker of a match, so I've organised a few key people to send me sms updates as the game progresses. .  Good one. Not !

You would not believe I actually managed to see Shrek II last weekend.. Yay me !  Tara and I refused to actually name what we were planning to do for fear of jinxing ourselves yet again, but we made it and bloody hell, what a fantastic movie.  The cops scene had me rolling on the floor along with Farbucks on nearly every corner.. such a well written sequel to an already funny movie.  So my week has been a long one, even though it was a short one (due to the public holiday on Monday).  Was called into work on the Monday for a few hours, then had a  horrendous day at work on Tuesday..  Tell you what, I so needed to go to kickboxing on Wednesday night - I really had to hit something, and if it wasn't the punching bag, it was almost going to be my bosses head.. seriously, the guy needs to take a lesson in attention to detail.  I could have thrown him, along with my computer, outside our office window 15 storeys up.  Happy families now, of course, and we've just been having a discussion about the new guy starting in our team. My age (26), Russian, been in Australia since he was 13.. Someone I better get along with, cos I have to work 12 hours a day with him plus sit next to him.. a lot of time to spend with someone who has the potential to drive you up the wall !  Anyways - have been seriously thinking about chucking my job in and heading OS for a while, so it may be irrelevent if I don't like him !   Of course, it wont be till this time next year, so I'll be going on a fact-finding mission to try and figure out what I want to do with my life - I think it's that whole Saturn's return thing happening again.. or that's what I like to tell myself anyways.  Makes for an interesting read and doesn't make me feel like my life is so not in control.   Oh, and get this - had my eyes tested yesterday and I bloody need bi-focals !  How OLD do I feel ??  Ok, so maybe not bi-focals as such, but special glasses for the computer cos my eyes have worsened over the last two years.. Better to try to ellivate the problem now, me thinks, instead of regretting it later in life.  Fuuuuckk.. first it's the eyes, then the rest of the body will follow !
