dis days... Aniwae got a lot of things to say... Haiz, dunno when this things will end... Yesterday was my skool's NDP Celebration... Damn, it was boring... Our Band was shit... Screwed up on the fanfare.. Wat a shame... As Mr Chew said, ''THE GREAT SWISS WINDS" is gone... Talk more bout band later... Niwae, bout the celebration, the parade was good but wat saddened me is dat my dearest FADHLI didn't march... Dunno why... No wonder he looks so moody... Worst part, after our performance we were not aloud to go back to our house... The band was especially shameless, they were not sporty... Spoilt the whole fun alot of times... Fuck the band man... Seniors sux... Just b'cos there are in sec3 they can boss us around... Got hand, got leg, dunno how to carry instrument... FUCK!!!!!!!!!! Niwae, then was the house games... Niwae, he won third. N brown house won the overall championship... Blue got second... Brown house really mesmerize me cos they are very small in numbers but their spirit is high.... Blue house made a joke out of themselves.. So slow in responding... I tink green won third... Not sure... N worst still go back to school the majors lecture us... Actually i blame 97% of wat we are now to the majors... Talk to people but they themselves are the same... Sux!!!!!!!!!!!! Feel like quittin band...       Niwae, about the band, i dunno wats up wit it... I'm also giving up on it dat's y i absent myself today... Mr chew also the same... He noes our band standard has drop but yet he still wants to carry on playing Scootin for SYF... I hate that song n i guarentee if we play dat song, we are dead... We are not even half way thru the song and iwe are less than 1 year from the competition... Band just sux... They better make me become somethin useful in the band in future... Or else... I dunno... Niwae i really hope i can become the student conductor or something or major or at least a QM... Well, let's just wait n see...        Niwae, i've been reading alot of other people's blog... Nice... Read: Erlinnna, Fahmy, Faezah, Bryan, Paula, Jennifer n alot of others.... Well, i tink dat's all i have for now....
