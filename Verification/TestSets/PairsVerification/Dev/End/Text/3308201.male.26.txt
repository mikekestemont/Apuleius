think I deserve it. I've had a really rough life, and even though I'm doing "decent" right now, I can't help but feel that I need/want/deserve more.   Oh well...enough ranting. Time for a drink and...and...well...something else. :-)
So, these past couple of weeks I've seen some decent shows. Last weekend I hit up the Doheny Heritage festival in Dana Point. Saturday was James Brown & Etta James (among others), we heard them from the beach. It was kind of a bummer to not SEE James Brown, but hearing him and his band was enough. Very fucking talented musicians.   Sunday we actually went into the show, toasty and un-sober. Saw the Dirty Dozen Brass Band which is always a pleasure. The real treat was of course the one and only, Robert Randolph. I will travel far and wide to see him and the Family Band. We were right up front against the stage, and there we stood for his hour long, explosive set. DDBB came onto guest and they covered Papa was a Rolling Stone. HOLY SHIT!! WOW!! To top it all off, I caught his thumb-pick. The rest of the day was spent seeing various other bands that weren't that great (Lucinda Williams....SCREEEEEEEECH). Except for the closers, Los Lobos. They were really good, but just not my style. I really tried getting into them, but they were definately lacking something. DDDB guested with them as well. It was a great weekend by the beach with good music. I couldn't ask for more.   As for this past Memorial Day weekend, a friend of mine came into town and we got tore up on Friday night till 6am. The proceeding Saturday hurt bad, but I managed to make it to my friends graduation party. Good food, good laughs, good people. Good times? Yes. Hot? Yes. Hungover? YES!!!!! Thankfully, over time, I recouped nicely and got to getting over to Irvine to see...PRIMUS!!!  Such a good show. The performed the entire Frizzle Fry album after a full one hour set of brain crushing rhythms. Mud, Jerry, Puppies, & Rush's yyz in it's entirety were just a few of the memorable moments. During the intermission between sets they had these hilarious drug related propaganda videos from the 60's & 70's on the screens. The entire place was not only filled with smoke, but bellowing with laughter at these things. Such a good time.   Sunday was a relaxing day at Topanga Days, a music and arts festival in the hills. Very family orientated. Kids, Food, Beer. Saw some old faces and met some new. Heard a really good reggae band called Resonation. They were down from SLO. Ran into an ex and went back to her and her man's house for drinks. It was chill yet a bit awkward for obvious reasons. On the way out there I ran into a girl I have a crush on, and of course, didn't act on it as usually...but that's a whole nuther story that involves certain inept brain funtions. I'll touxhon those next I think.   Til the next s
