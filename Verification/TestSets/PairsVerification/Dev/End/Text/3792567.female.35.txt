to our industry (aviation).  It effected us the most.  All of the companies and people who went out of business and or lost their jobs.  You should be spittin mad.   Make a stand and show them you are not afraid.  Go to NYC!!!!
New reality show last night folks.  Growing up Gotti. It was on A&E at 9:30. A day in the life of V. Gotti daughter of John Gotti (now deceased Mafia boss - oh I am sorry he was in plumbing) and her three boys.  Another one I would recommend just to see the train wreck of a family. This is one that I will keep watching because I am waiting for the cameracrew to get beat up and their stuff stolen just so the kids can fence it.  Seriously guys, check your gear.  I bet something valuble is missing.  These kids are a whole lotta trouble.  Check your papers in a few years.  Remember that name...Gotti.   Tonight is a special one.  Reality tv galore.  I love Tuesday TV.  Don't forget we have Trading Spouses on Fox (New family - tears shed - woo hoo).  Then see what happens at 9 on Big Brother (I see the times a changing. Last weeks twists and turns were wonderful).  The Amazing Race and Queer Eye and Jessica Simpson all compete at 10.  Get those tv clickers programed.  Thank goodness for commercials.  I never miss a show!!!  Oh - dont forget to try to catch "Things I hate about you" on Bravo @11.  I know its late - but if your up its worth peeking at.
ok - I think I am in lust with George W.  He winks at me everytime he talks to me on the TV.  Swoon.
Went on a road trip this weekend with two boys.  This is a little story I wrote to remember the trip.  Boys smell.  Boys fart and burp.  They eat your chips when your sleeping.  They push their seats all the way back and you have no leg room.  They want to borrow your pillow.  Your magazine.  Even though they made fun when you packed it.  Boys drive way too fast when it rains. Then yell at you to stop talking so they can concentrate.  They hog the radio and make you listen to sports.  Boys get mad when you have to stop and pee.  Boys smell.
I heading to NYC in the next couple of weeks. I have never been there and I am really looking forward to my trip.  I am staying in the middle of Times Square. In the same hotel the Republican delegates that are attending the RNC. I will get over my fear and head towards the highest building and head up. I will dance and taunt you in front of the NYSE. I will wave at the Statue of Liberty and I plan on taking the subway to go see a NY Yankees game.  Why? Because I am not scared of you!!!  You towel headed, boy-butt loving terrorists will not ruin my day.  But- how I wish I could ruin y
