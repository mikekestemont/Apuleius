yet but I've seen some of the beginning like at least the first five, then skip like ten and that's about where I am. I've seen a few down further but not by much! Its on channel 52 (adult swim) at 11:30c Mondays to Thursdays. For ones that are closer to the end its on 52 at 11:00...Or is it 11:30..On Saturdays! I so hope Inuyasha and kagome end up together at the end! I hope he decides to become full human...If none of you know what the heck I am talking about then too bad for you! I know I'm a dork for liking this stuff but I don't care anymore!&nbsp;Oh yeah, Over the summer I decided not to eat meat! I have wanted to&nbsp; for a long time but my parents actual told me&nbsp;I couldn't become a vegetarian! But they have decided to allow me! If any of you are tired of listening to me I'm sure&nbsp; I will write more interesting things another day! But I'm sorry, it wont be today! Well I'm going to get going! (I don't even think anyone is and or will read my blog!)
Hey! I just started this as you can see! I Get really bored a lot so now I have something I can do! Well its summer and so far I haven't done much! But thats okay! I dont really mind! My birthday is comming up in a month, I know thats a long ways away but you cant blame me! I think I would like to just skip it because I don't really want anything! I don't even want cake! Thats not like me!!! Well I'll write again later! Bye everyone who might be reading this!
Hey everyone, Sorry it has been so long. Ive just been really busy. I just got a letter about me being invited to go to paris, rome and all of that for school! My parents laughed and threw it away. I just got a 10 gallong tank for my fish in my room. Its really cool! I like my friend Sarah's more. But thats cool. My mom baught me somethign that is in her tank because I told her what Sarah's looked like and told her I like it. I hope outs is atleast a diferant color. Not much I can do if it isnt. I just got three fish so far! They are suposed to be schooling fish but I dont think they are. They are some type of zebra fish. But If you look really close you can tell that they have blue stripes not black. They are kind of weird looking.    I just not to long ago cut my hair. It was soo messed up! I tryed to fix it, no, its not worse. It is better but still looks bad. Its grown out sence then. I colored it also. It was the color I had it before. It is Golden Blonde. Afterwords I highlited it. It kindof turned out bad. But Im living with It! Well I will type later. B
