Let me know how you all are, like I say I dunno how easy it is going to be for me to stay in touch, but I'll do my best.  I'll miss you all very much.

Hello boys and girls,  I am now slightly unbeleivably in Tanzania. When I went on holiday with my family a few weeks ago I had a rough idea that I would stay if i could find anything worthwhile to do, but i sincerely didnt think I'd find it, but i kind of did albeit in a terribly unpaid fashion. Nevertheless the job is cool, and the people/landscape/food is brilliant.  So there we go, I stayed they went. If all goes well I'll be back in Spetember so its not a proper good bye a la Cormac. Feel sorry for not updating you all on things before I went and milking the departure for at least a piss up but I didnt really know i'd stay. In fact Revolution had me shifted on for work all this and last week. Whoops. :P  Anyway hope you are all doing well I'll start sending out some proper emails the next time I have a large task to do at work. In case you dont know my email is johnprimrose (at) hotmail.com and as scott or cormac could tell you I'm always on MSN.  Take it easy  John  Look at this if you havent already  urlLink www.rockpapersaddam.com
