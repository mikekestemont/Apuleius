has ever been, according to a Salon.com article:  &nbsp;  "In September 2001, Bush said capturing bin Laden was 'our No. 1 priority.' By March 2002, he was claiming, 'I don't know where he is. I have no idea and I really don't care. It's not that important.'   In October 2001, he was dead set against the need for a Department of Homeland Security. Seven months later, he thought it was a great idea.   In May 2002, he opposed the creation of the 9/11 commission. Four months later, he supported it.   During the 2000 campaign, he said that gay marriage was a states' rights issue: "The states can do what they want to do." During the 2004 campaign, he called for a constitutional ban on gay marriage.

Sign It, Damn You   Tom Mauser (the guy who's son was killed at Columbine and appeared in Bowling For Columbine) has started a petition to extend the ban on assault weapons.  He apparently chose me (and about 35 other bloggers) to send out the message and get out the vote, I guess.  I'm kind of flabbergasted by this.  Why would he and his Petition team choose little old me for this?  Whatever... just sign it, yo.  Guns are really really bad... especially these kind.   urlLink Go here for some petition MADNESS!!!!
W. Ketchup offers choice for all!   A company has introduced a new type of Ketchup dubbed "W Ketchup."  They are blatantly right-leaning.  I don't care that they are, they can lean whatever fucking way they want, but they are serious hypocrites.  W. Ketchup is supposed to be an alternative to Heinz ketchup (Because Kerry's wife is the heiress to the Heinz fortune).  The company takes pride in being American made, claiming Heinz has 57 factories in foriegn countries (I don't know if that number is correct, but it's probably not far off). Yet, the causes they overtly lean to (Republicans, anyone?) support, and are in the pocket of, big business.  Corporations like GM, Nike, etc... often close their factories in America and move to 3rd world countries.  Actually, Nike has no factories in America anymore. So basically, by supporting the Republicans, W Ketchup just sends more jobs out of the USA.  In my opinion, Heinz is most likely like all corporations: greedy.  Kerry's wife was, actually, at one time married to Republican senator John Heinz (Who died).  And Kerry was not my choice for the Democratic ticket.  He voted for NAFTA, and is not the most Liberal guy around.  But he is the lesser of two evils.  I'm not defending Kerry, I'm just pointing out the hypocrisy.  See how dumb these assholes can be?
