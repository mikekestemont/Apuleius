how it starts. And even if they DON'T have the same intrests, guys will lie....sorry to bust our shit guys, but it's true, i've done it, you've done it, everyone has...some of us more than others.  I mean think about it, the more you have in common, the better right? then the whole courtship process begins...errrrrrrrrr....  5: Numbers: Croton...even ossining....the selction of guys are slim to none...i consider myself very lucky to go out with lilia...and like i've said, i've told her...i'm pretty sure jones feels the same way..but...in college...the guy population increases..TEN FOLD!. Sure, most of them will most likely be assholes, but shit, theres BOUND to be guys like me and jones there..fuck, you know what? it's garuanteed.  And maybe they'll have some characterisitics that makes them a "better" version of us....ya...FUCK.  But, ya, in a nutshell, thats the problem.  And the reason why college SUCKS.   hmm, what else...photo gallery is going down, but i'm not surprised.  I've never seen a website that david made longer than acouple of months, he always drops them..but w/e, czzank's got em' now.  I'm not mad or anything.  i need doom 3 right now.  hmm...thats about it....this is my last week of summer school, and that lady at Shop rite still hasn't shown up....yay.....  Playing way to much NFSU... steve
