opened road in the small seas in the small homes of those who left without looking back  out of the rack and ruin of our meaningless death, the rape and rot and stealth and stab you must remain beautiful must redeem your land  tonight with this heavy burden we walk through naked rooms with blindfold heads  opening doors for possibility is there a need for heaven? at this hour, what our loving is burning. someone tell me should i sleep now  you keep a light on by your cranium your love for me is like sewing colors stitching uneven needle pierces through with each stroke of his hand.  at this hour, what is dead has not worried about us and we are now fugitives  someone tell me should i sleep now the streets keeps talking my mouth of teeth is rotten  a beard glass stained with breath of gasoline and tunnels  the baptismal fire, the common doves, the tap water  at this hour, what is alive is helpless kind and helpless while we live someone tell me to leave love alone it feels like burning nights running away.  burning through streams of flickering letters signs, billboards these machines throb quicker than your heart,  decapitated heads, silk canvases wrapped around the wounds believe in the fall of your age, it supposed to shine like sharp knuckles shine on you crazy diamond  you cut the glowing, yellow buildings in two, breaks the walls into uneven halves; you looks at the breaths seeping from those small empty houses  pounding pianos, children's cries, head banging against the only landscape that was able to make him feel.  you wonders at your skull shaped like an ego, if it will ever break every day you shove back your black tar from your concrete and then one day plant loads of dynamite (i never was enough for you)  observe the clouds and what is hanging in them: globes, penal codes, dead cats and locomotives	  they turn in the skins of white clouds like trash in a puddle. while below on the earth a banner, the color of a romantic rose,	flutters,  and a long row of trains crawls on the weed-covered tracks.
