had this extremely irritating guy, who is also in my class, wanting to play games. He asks Ankit, the one who hath the 6600, if he can play or not and Ankit allows. We received certain complaints that somebody is playing without registering, looking into the matter we found out that it was that same person. On being interrogated he replies that he has asked the teacher. WHICH TEACHER???????? answer: Mr. Ankit Wadhwa, who was happily chatting on his phone a few minutes later. I hope Karan posts an official entry on Domain Square thank you
Did you know that Intel EEs(Extreme Edition) are based on the Galatin core , that is,they are Xeons in the disguise of P4s. Also,they have 2mb l3 cache,512kb l2 cache , so that accounts to 2.5mb cache(we all know that intel cpus don't have much l1 cache,so that is neglible).  Amd officially announced that the prices of the amd athlon xp will be raised from 10-30% depending upon the model and the prices of the amd 64 to go down by the same , globally.
OK, rescheduling again, this time because of dear old  urlLink TechEdge . So, we have two tentative dates now, which are  Thursday the 5th and Friday the 6th (same time : 1.30pm) . I would like comments from the people who want to attend so that we can decide on the most favourable date.  A recap for those who haven't read about  urlLink Sessions@Exun  or more specifically  urlLink PHP . The idea of Sessions@Exun was conceived so that interested people may learn a specific skill in computers from people who have already learnt that skill and are experienced in it. This helps because reading big, fat books is tedious and sometimes if the book is technical, then confusing as well. Teachers are always better than books anyway.  More specifically  PHP  ( P HP:  H ypertext  P reprocessor) is an HTML-embedded scripting language, which means that it is used for serving dynamic content on web pages, just like ASP. The only difference (usage-wise) between ASP and PHP is that ASP is a Microsoft product and needs a Windows Server to run on while PHP is Open Source and can run on any OS. And since Linux is being more widely deployed these days, it makes more sense to learn PHP if you're doing Server-Side Scripting. I am told that PHP is tougher than ASP, but since I have no knowledge of PHP (I'm counting on this Session myself), I can't say anything about that.   About  Mukul : Many people have asked me who Mukul is, so let me introduce him. Mukul is an Exun alumnus, currently studying at Iowa State University (US). He is here in Delhi for his summer break and has found time to give us an introduction to PHP, which he says is his mother tongue.  Please comment away people. We want to know who's coming and what day is more favourable - Thursday or Friday.  --Karan  PS: Any student of DPS RK Puram can attend, not just Exun m
