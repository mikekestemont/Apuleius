left unanswered or what...??? The darkness was deadly........there was blood all over the place...those who had gone to pray were killed for reasons unknown....or may b for being The faithful!!! Death took over the city..........questions that rose in the minds of people was....WHY??why were these innocent people killed.......why did they deserve to have a death like this......why were they chosen to die in that manner.......but who has the answers?? KARACHI, once had peace and happiness reflecting thru the lights sparkling out of the eyes of its people......and now those sparkles have been replaced by fear...fear of death.....fear of being burnt alive....when will this massacre end?.....when will the common man be safe enough in the city to dream of a healthy and safe life...........When will a common man look forward to a safe and secure day for  himself and his children.........who has the answers?? when death takes over...LIFE RESIGNS!!! life has always been playing hide and seek with death, sometimes its life that wins and other r the times when death takes over but now is the time when  LIFE HAS RESIGNED ...........it has been loosing enough to continue with the battle......when today in the mosque a small child lost her father,  life lost a battle  .......when an 18 year old in the mosque was desperately trying to breath but failed .. it was life again that failed ......life lost when a young energetic Doctor was burnt alive in the mosque leaving behind a beautiful wife having all the hopes of a happy life ahead ....it wasnt the Dr that died it was life that lost again......and now its time! life has resigned..and death has taken over the city KARACHI......once known to b the city of lights!!!........ when death reigns....... fear mounts and insecurity is the order of the day........ Lets hope that this city, dear enough to a lot of people doesn't end up being the city of deaths!!!
