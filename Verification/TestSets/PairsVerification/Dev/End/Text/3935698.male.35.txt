whatever.  You never see the outrage when people make fun of the Libertarians.  Those wacky far right wingers want to get rid of the IRS?  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  What a bunch of dopes.  Look at how the religious folks on my side are portrayed?  They are cartoons, but if you treated an African American like that, Jesse Jackson would be knocking on your door with thousands of his paid protesters.  To put it in a nutshell, they are trying to change the very way we think.  Make us think that it is better to let 3 states burn up because it is bad to cut down trees.  Brainwash us into thinking that eating meat is barbaric.  All of this control centers around Big Government.  I get tickled about the left trying to compare the right to the book by George Orwell, 1984.  In their world, 1984 is a dream.  Control of the people to make sure we are all equally miserable is the ultimate goal of the left.  In the right v left chapter, we will discuss this further, but I think it is imperative to touch on this many times.  The left is happy with a government that is growing and slowly taking over aspects of our lives to make sure we are “safe, etc”.  The right is working hard to keep with the vision of our founding fathers.  Limited government and to give all Americans the opportunity to move up by their boot straps  Don’t fall for it.  Keep your mind free.  I hope you now have an idea who we are dealing with here.  Don’t forget that these are the common threads that hold the left particularly the Democratic Party together.  For any movement to be a movement they have to have a commonality.  Their particular agendas may vary, but the base is generally the same.  I would be amazed to see a liberal pronounce that the government should not tell us to do this that or the other.  You will never see a leftist proclaim that the middle and upper class is being overburdened with taxes.  I may have overlooked some commonalities.  If I did, let me know!  I love hearing from like thinkers.  Now that we have the base built, let’s move onto the specifics of these Species.  We will be discussing several Species on the left.  As in this chapter, there will be some common threads that pull them together, but there are some very large differences between the groups.  Don’t be fooled by the rhetoric from the left.  “Our party is about diversity!  That is why we have so many different groups that are a part of the movement”  That is basically a bunch of crap!  They are diverse as long as you hold the common themes listed above to be gospel.
