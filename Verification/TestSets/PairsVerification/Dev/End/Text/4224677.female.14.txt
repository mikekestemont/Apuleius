1 hour and 30 minutes. I'm a teenager so we start doing things. And then my mom finds out everything. I'm grounded. Even though it wasn't that bad, my mom still didn't like it. I was grounded for about 3 1/2 weeks. Which meant no anything... Then I finally got to watch TV. And that was about all. And my mom didn't even trust me alone at my house. I had to go everywhere with her. Then on my birthday I called him up and was talking to him for about 5-10 minutes. And he told me to check my e-mail as soon as possible because he had an urgent message... And it sounded like it was and I thought it was a braking up message. Well later that day I was checking my e-mail and I read that one and he did brake up with me... ON MY BIRTHDAY!!! What kind of person does that to someone?? I don't! Then the next day I went to my friend Steph's house and I told her all about it and that I didn't know why he broke up with me. And we decided to call him at his friends house and ask him. So we called him up and he told me that "You are grounded and we never can hang out or barely see each other" Well... He was the one who got me grounded... So I don't know why he said that. But then I was like: "Why did you brake up with me on my birthday then?" Then he told me that he didn't know it was my birthday. Which I know he did because he wrote it on his calender! Because I saw it there when I went to his house!! But I wrote him this big long e-mail telling him how much my life sucked right then and how he made it worse. But then later on that week my friend Vanessa told me that he went on 2 dates when he went down to Mass! And 1 of the dates was going to her HOTEL ROOM!!! And how did she find this out?? His bestfriend Mike who was there that whole week! When he was going out with me. Now I think there's some other reason why he broke up with me. Vanessa told Mike that he cheated on me and his response was: "It's not cheating if it's not the same area code." !!! So I could have 2 boyfriends?? Just each one from a different town?? That's so stupid. Cheating is cheating! So now I wanna know the WHOLE truth about what he did down in Mass.! And I wanna know it soon. And my friend invited me to her "party" and she also invited my ex-boyfriend. And I wanna go and make him jealous and also see if he says anything to me!! Anyways thats my sucky ass story! Got anything to say?? Well go ahead and say it!! Hopefully JOHN reads this!! To see how much of a DICK he really i
