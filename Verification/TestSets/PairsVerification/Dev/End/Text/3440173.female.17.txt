and stop putting comments in like you know what goes on in my life. So who are you really?
This is to whoever free_to_fly is. I have no idea who you are and if your going to make comments on my thing then please tell me who you are cause your being a coward by not saying anything. You have no idea what I go through everyday and what happens. I'm not the one who fucks off with the relationship the guys do. I'm very close to a lot of my ex bf's and theres nothing wrong with that. So what if old feelings come back, everyone has them. Jamie, Matt, Matt, and Kris are just really close to me now. I am happy with Adam and plan on staying with him for awhile now. So how about you stay the hell out of my business and let me deal with it and my feelings. The only three ppl that know what goes on in my life are Crystal, Caleb, and Kaitlin. So don't be putting your comments in my journal cause I don't want to hear them.
Anyways since the last time I wrote in this a lot has happened. First of all after seeing my ex I called him that night and we got together with Crystal and Jay and watched some movies and what not and talked about how we miss each other and what not and we all just had a good time and he asked me out so now were dating which is what I wanted. He's the sweetest thing alive. So then last night I went over to his house and stayed the night and we talked and watched movies and it was a good time. I'm happy were back together again.  So tonight Canada Day. Crystal, Min, Jay and I went to South Mountain and saw all our friends there and watched the fireworks and then from 10 to 1 we sang songs on the bleachers and talked and danced and it was just awesome. Something I'm definiatley going to remember always. it was a good night. But the down side was that there was so much drama and Crystal and Jay were there together and Sarah (his ex gurlfriend, also our friend) was there and she's pissed at them and what not and was acting like she was two. She wouldn't stop complaining and everyone just wanted to have a good night but she pissed everyone off. Even tho she can't be mad bc her and J ended and she said Crystal could go for J. It's so stupid but the retarded thing is is that she is going for Clinton when Andrea has been trying to get with him forever. So she's doing the exact same thing she THINKS Crystal is doing to her. So she is being a hypocrite. Man were all suppose to be adults and what not. Whatever I ain't getting into the middle of this shit. Summer is for fun and thats all I'm going to have. Anyways tired. C
