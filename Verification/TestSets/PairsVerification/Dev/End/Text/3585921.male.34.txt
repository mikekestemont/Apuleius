or more like have smiles, and puts her hand on hair waste, and leaves me]  &nbsp;  I have never heard of this cemetery, so I ask some people about, I am told hundreds of Palestinians are kept there, some for as long as twenty years, only a number, their family not allowed the basic right to grieve for them.&nbsp; &nbsp;
I travel between Ramallah and Jerusalem regularly as I am staying in Jerusalem, the UNDP office is in Jerusalem as well, but most of my meetings happens to be in Ramallah.  Today was another day at the office, I took the bus from Jerusalem to the check point, crossed the check point and another bus from the other side of the check point to center of Ramallah, a trip that would last 20 minutes with no check points and lasts about an hour and a half now… a trip many Palestinians take on daily bases.  Today, was slightly deferent… on my way home I took the bus to the check point to notice the that it was unusually busy. Later I noticed that in fact it was closed and all these people were just waiting on the hope of the Israeli’s opening it.

The soldiers were strict no one pass, one of them felt sorry for every body, and kept saying he was sorry, the others didn’t care, but one guy seemed to be enjoying it, laughing, even pointing his gun at angry, tired Palestinians waiting to pass.  That night I really felt the brunt of a brutal occupation, an occupation that has it it’s core a mission to humiliate Palestinians and create a culture of hatred, cultural cleansing and a systematic plan to create ghettos of cheap labor Palestinians living solely for the benefit of a modern Israeli supreme Jewish state.
