not being depressed.  It's been 6 months since we broke up and I've not really felt good about her or myself in much longer than that.  Other things in my life have been working out nicely which has helped to offset the shit, but I'm tired of tryin to counterbalance shit.  I just wanna be happy.  This is gonna really sting.  For a long time.  I'll let you know how things turn out.
My little sister is coming up this Friday to visit.  I'm throwin a little party for her.  Things have been a bit better in all aspects of life.  I'm almost inclined to believe im receiving my comeuppance (spelling?).  Karma may actually exist.  The weekend should be fun.  It will definitely be expensive so I'm hoping there will at least be some good times to make it worthwhile.  I dont think I've ever partied with my little sister so that should be interesting.  It's a costume party and we happen to have matching outfits.  Oh luck be a lady.  My computer is still possessed.  I'm not computer illiterate by any means and my friends are certified geniuses on the subject and yet my computer ailments always get the same reaction from them "I have NEVER seen that before".  I dunno what it is about every computer I own.  I think it may be a cursed name.  I've always named my comp's Grendel 1.0 2.0 etc and they are all pretty nasty machines once i've finished putting them together, but all are cursed to inexplicable problems.  My jobs goin good these days.  Things are lookin up in that respect.  I have actually run across a Plan B in case the promotion doesn't go through.  Best case scenario for either one would leave me close to, at or over the 100k/year mark so thats not too bad.  Lots more Pbr for damn sure.  On that note I've recently been awarded the frequent drinkers (aka alcoholics) discount at Engine Room.  Funny, I've been loyal and ever-faithful in my good tipping there for the past oh 5 or 6 years and only now that they have changed names ( I have to still call it by its true identity ) and only now do I receive accomodation.  I still get carded by their newer door staff though :) I have long given up on being annoyed by that.  I can't imagine there will ever come a day when I'm no longer carded.  If all else fails in the work force I plan on posing as a 18 yr. old runaway and cleaning pools for some rich baroness and becoming her beast of burden in exchange for a healthy weekly stipend.  I've always wanted an older woman anyways.  I believe I'm gonna go for now.  Sorry dear blog that I've neglected you for a while now.  You know I'll never stray too far.  To do: make a website, con a friend into teaching me guitar, finish dark tower series, squirrel money away for future endeavors, take my vitamins, dont do drugs, and stay in s
