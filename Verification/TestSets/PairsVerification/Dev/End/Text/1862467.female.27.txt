I know movements like these will give my kids a leg up in future education and job markets? Yes, and I'm sorry. But movements like these are clearly led by parents who themselves are unsure about technology so they protect themselves from the introduction into child-tech toys under a pretense of protecting the children.   I see around me today that the kids who learned their tech ropes on early Atari and Nintendo games, even Telnet for the hardcore oldschoolers like John, are the highest achieving professionals. They--we--are the up-and-coming tech savvy kids these technophobes are already afraid of. And our kids are going to be amazing.   I first realized this before I had kids, when I watched my then-three-year-old, now seven-year-old little sister load her own draw program, draw a picture, and then print it. When Aidan was two we gave him his first computer and he mastered it's capabilities regarding his programs. He's always been, and at one, Ellie already is, a SesameStreet.org fan.

According to a 2003 survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, 31 percent of children age 3 and under are already using computers. Sixteen percent use them several times a week, 21 percent can point and click with a mouse by themselves and 11 percent can turn on the computer without assistance."

urlLink USATODAY.com - Working moms' kids do fine, as long as moms keep tabs : "There's reassuring news for mothers concerned that their challenging work lives could hurt their school-age kids: Teenagers aren't more likely to dabble in drugs and sex just because their moms work long hours, and preteens left 'home alone' often aren't the worse for it, suggest studies to be reported Friday.   Most research on the children of working mothers has focused on preschoolers. But newer studies, due at the American Psychological Association meeting in Honolulu, are looking at how older kids fare. In a confidential survey, 496 teens reported habits such as drinking, smoking, drugs, sex and not using seat belts or helmets. The teenagers' mothers reported how many hours they w
