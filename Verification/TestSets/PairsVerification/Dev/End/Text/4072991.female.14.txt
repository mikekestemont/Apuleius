and crap and totally messed up the carts and natalie flew into mine and then i flew out of it cuase i did a donut and flew out! it was so scary! then natalie ran into me and ruined hte front end of the cart cause shes a moron and doesnt think. Then after 2 hours of that we went into Fontana and looked at beautiful houses then went Gordy's then to the grocery store.THEY HAVE THE BEST GROCERY STORE!! We came home, made a scrumpious din din then Natalie and I had another golf cart palooza! Then I came home and painted and then went on a night cart ride to look for dear or whatever then watched the fireworks down on the pier. It was amazing! It so sereal and peaceful! Came home- painted some more then went to bed. Sunday- I was woken up rudely again by Natalie and Louie and we went to starbucks but I was in my pajamas which included basketball shorts and a little tank top with no shoes and my dad wanted me to get out of the car and go and get stuff from Starbucks! I THINK NOT! Then we went down to Gordy's again to get the boat and my dad wanted me to get out again in front of a bunch of normal looking people. SOmetimes I think he doesnt think. We drove home- correction I drive home! hhehe!! I am good! And got in our bathingsuit adn packed up for the ghetto pontoon boat! LET ME TELL YOU! IT WAS TRUELY GHETTO! We didnt even have seats, we had lawn chairs and mine kept moving and oh man it was horrible! Then we "dropped anckor" to swim and it took us about 20 trys because my dad didnt think that we were stable but we were cause you could tell when i brought the anckor up and a bunch of nasty seaweed and rocks came up. Then finally we were stable and i jumped into a pile of seaweed then got back on the ghetto boat and went cruising back past beautiful homes that i would die to live in. Got back to the house, showered and off back to go ol' Wheaton, Illinois! Of course we stopped at Frateillo's though! I love that place and across the street there is a boat on a giant stick! ITS SO COOL! Then we got home at around 7 then Nick and I talked on the phone and came up with the plan of playing tennis since there is nothing better to do so me, Rachey, Nick, Evan, and Craig went and played tennis! It was fun except for the fact that i slid into a pile of piss and the kid was laughing at me then i fell off the rock climbing thing, yea i wasnt laughing! Then Rachy's dad came and picked us up at 10 and I came home and now Emily and Natalie are annoying the crap out of me!! I gotta go! I love ya a
