the best friends I've got, and I don't wanna lose him, but in a year's time I'm probably gonna lose all contact with him, and I don't want to, because like I said, he's one of the few people who takes me exactly as he sees me. He doesn't care whether I'm hyper or depressed, he copes with me when I am hyper and over the top, and when I'm depressed he's there for me. He doesn't ever appear to be uncomfortable around me, and he's the ONLY person who's like that, even my BEST friends sometimes feel a bit awkward when I'm hyper. He means a lot to me, and I don't think he realises how much. I'm sitting here bawling my eyes out because he's so nice to me and he's leaving in a year's time, and I don't want him to go. I feel like he understands me, who I am, more than I understand myself, and I don't wanna lose him, I don't want him to leave. He probably doesn't know who he is, but if he is reading this, then don't go. Please don't leave me.
I promise, we will all be loved, because we're all beautiful in our own individual ways.  Yeah, soppy emotinoal bullshit, I know. But still, I like to hope there's someone out there for everyone.

(Not onlie.) I'm home alone again in the sweltering heat, and I've got to do English coursework.  Somebody shoot me.  No, I'm sorry, I have no reason to be depressed. I'm just really tired and I get like this when I'm tired. No matter how much sleep I have though I can nver seem to shake off the feeling of melancholy.
I'm tired.  I stayed up until 12.15 on Friday night cutting out stars and sticking them and picture and things up on the wall ready for Emaa's disco. Then I had to get up at 7am on Saturday morning so I could get into town before Emma did. Then Jess came over and I was all happy but I spent all afternoon doing party dances (music man, superman, cha cha slide, pizza hut etc) with 5 year olds. I was extremely tired after this. I nearly fell asleep on the sofa at the club, but I didn't. Then I was hungry and had three (small...) bowls of jelly and a fairy cake. Previously my "diet" had been ruined anyway by smiley potatoes, cocktail sausages and chicken nuggets (all deep fat fried :'( so fatty) but I ruined it even more. I had a decent, 10 hour sleep last night but now I can't get back to sleep even though I'm still shattered.  I'm not okay, I'm crap, I feel ill, my head keeps spinning even when I'm sitting down, I'm tired, my nack is killing me, I'm jealous, I'm evil, and I want to d
