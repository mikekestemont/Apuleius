to be a phenomenal Dad.  I mean, one of the best of all time.  Your child is going to be loved and cool and it is going to have a big head.  Good on ya' mate.  Panda - I want you to love me even though I'm flaky.  It always goes from endearing to annoying, but it usually goes back to endearing.  Hang in there with me.  BB -  Best wishes on your exam.  Please send me a few ab workouts.  My situation is desperate (but not serious)!

I've been here for almost 8 months now, and all I can add to my resume is that I've developed super-human hearing.  You see, I sit in a cube farm next to probably one of the busiest areas of our office - the bathroom. So, if everyone goes to the bathroom the requisite 2 times a day (some more, some less), and approximately 100 people in my area use this bathroom, that means about 200 times a day someone walks past my desk, with my computer in full view.  Yet, I am still able to read tons of newspapers, goofy websites, and view/download photos on the internet without being detected. How?  It's the super-human hearing. It's become so well-tuned in fact, that I can tell exactly who is behind me, just by the sound his/her shoes/clothes make. My peripheral vision is not too shabby either. Flip-flops? That's Babs. Rustling-sounding suit? Easy - that's Jean. Pastel shirt out of the corner of my eye? Ha - that's our director.  What's especially nice: in the mornings, our boss uses this rolly-cart thing to bring her laptop in and out of the office. When she's rollin' on in, she's making a lot of noise. This gives me and my coworker enough time to stop gabbing (which we usually do for the first 1/2 hour we're in the office) and get in our seats and look busy. We both have developed this keen sense of sound detection.  It's brilliant!
Hi.  I'm DJ Shovelpants.  You may remember me from my occasional posts on this here site 'Pandyland.'  Yeah, it's kind of an internet discussion group.  You know.  Well, I haven't been posting much.  Why?  Probably because there hasn't been much news for me to share.   Then why are you posting now, DJS?   Nice set-up.  Thanks for that.  Well, I've actually got some news.  Coming this February, there will be an addition to the Shovelpants family.   You're getting a new dog?  Oh, that's great news!   Nope.  Around February 11th or so, I'm going to be a dad.   Wait, let me do the math.  You were married in April, that's....carry the 3, minus 2...plus 6.  Wow.  You guys didn't waste any time.   Oh, shut u
