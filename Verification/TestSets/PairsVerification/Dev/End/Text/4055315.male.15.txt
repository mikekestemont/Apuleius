I wanted to stay. I played three games of skate yesterday, and won all of them... tricks included were: kickflip, heelflip, kickflip over a gutter, fakieflip, varial-flip, 360 nollie shovit, nollie big spin, some gaps, and other stuff... normal game, you know? Jarred and I hung out at Ali and Emily's house for a while, and Emily, Adam, Alison, Jarred, Tessa, Adam [different one], and Justin and myself were there, it was fun but it could've been better... Jarred's kingpin [if you don't skate, don't ask] broke off of his front truck [Venture trucks] and he had to ride a bike to my house. And now, back to the present, today: I had school off but it was a waste of time anyways, Jarred slept over and left an hour after we woke up because my dad made me cut and weedwack the front and back lawn, then sort literally 1000's [at least two thousand] of nails and screws and shit, I'm trying to sleep over Richie's so I can see Cassandra! I miss her so much :/ I can't get a hold of Richie... but I have to go do more chores [move 200+ pieces of firewood inside... GAY], love, me :). Later.  P.S. Fuck you for throwing me off that roof... you know who you are :)
Monday's always suck, right? I woke up and felt really bad, looked around for food for half an hour, and ended up cooking and eating 6 strips of bacon [not half-pieces, full pieces] and running to the bus stop and smoking two ciggs, my lucky from my old pack, and my new pack I just opened then. Nicotine + Bacon overdose + bumpy bus ride = imminent bad feelings :/, luckily, I didn't puke. It's Alison and Emily's birthday today, [they're my beautiful twin friends] so Happy Birthday you two :). I'm starving, so I'm going to go eat my steak dinner [ :D ] and cut the lawn after [ :( ]. Later.
I babysat all day yesterday, and only got $60 from it... but whatever. Anyways, a pack is already gone... and I got them yesterday. I skated most of the day, and had to go to the mall to meet Mike's mom, and Jereme was walking so slow, he skated downhill and was still insanely slow for the slope we were on. But he was walking, and going too slow, and we [Jon, Mike and I] told him to start skating or we'd leave, so we gave him a minute and left him on a main road, four streets from his house. Somehow he manages to get jumped by one person and get his board [which he's head for a whopping two days] stolen from him. Mike's mom ended up not meeting us up there in the end anyways... so it was a huge waste of time. Jon Mike and I went to my house after, and played some crappy looking samurai game on XBox for a while, but it ended up being good...  nothing else happened today, besides nothing. L
