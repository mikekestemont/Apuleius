EVER.  EH is back from Sweden, and apparently he is in love. He was my wingman for the night, but a fat lot of good it did judging from my success rate 0/0.  There weren't even any potentials! *sigh*
First things first.  I am sorry, I just have no patience for people who have lameass versions of my hang-ups, and lameass rationalizations for not getting involved with other people. Like this morning, I read something to this effect: "Oooh-oooh-oooh, I won’t allow myself to miss him because then I couldn’t cope…yadda yadda yadda"  Obviously from someone who has no idea that feelings are involuntary; when they come, they come, no if-s or but-s. It’s not like you can stop feeling something just because you want to, or think you should, or even know you should. Feelings are overwhelming and all encompassing…  *sigh*  It makes me so angry because she really doesn’t know better, she just thinks she is poetic.  ******************  Now that that boulder is safely off my chest, I thought I would write a little about what I am thinking about  MH  . I thought I had it figured out in my head what I thought about him, but it seems that the closer I am to my trip over there, the more I am thinking about him, and about the time that we spent together. I have lots of wonderful memories of him, and the things he said, and the expressions on his face, and the funny things that he did. But probably the best time was on NYE 03/04 when he whispered in my ear: "It's so good to see you really happy." And it just resonated in my heart, it was so opportune and appropriate, it was just so perfect. That moment will stay with me forever. So when I dwell on things like this, I realise more and more that I really cared about him, I have often said that it was just really really bad timing for us, but I don't really know. I know I trusted him generally, even though I know he is a formidable enemy when he is hurt or not on your side. I think he might just be the guy for me. It kind of surprised me when I thought it and took myself seriously, because when I get onto an idea, I wring every last drop of life out of it. But this is more of a quiet assertion. I know this is true, but I am not tripping myself over in an effort to make things happen. Also, I am not sure that he thinks I am the right girl for him. He likes my look, probably more now that I have been going to my PT and working out a lot more, but I think he has reservations because of the Mni thing. Gosh that was  so  ugly and  so  corrupt.  One of my best friends told me on Saturday (or was it Friday) that I was a masochist. I am afraid to think he might be r
