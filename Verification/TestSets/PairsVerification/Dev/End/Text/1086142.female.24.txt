midnight mall sale with a dog-eared Bible in her backpack, who lurches around the cathedral floor as an expression of her sheer and infinite religious devotion. I am a Catholic and while I am never a skeptic, I am terribly unorthodox. I don't go to church on Sundays or set an appointment for penitence. I prefer empty churches and converses with God in an informal, affected way, the way you would with a girlfriend. Amen.
Do you see this  beauty ? I want it. You heard me? I  WANT  IT. I am tired of my old pink Nokia 8210. So now I am working my ass off. Eight hours a day. Six days a week. I know my parents will give a huge fig about my working but they won't purchase the V200 for me anyway.   Sometimes, it's good to just shut up.
I am the one  who believes in all that you say  I am the one  who never wants to define herself  I am the one  who’s paralell, upfront, behind  I am the one  paddling like crazy through the night    I am the one  who stirs it up everytime  I am the one  who never knows how close she is  I am the one  who’d rather be dead than confess  I am the one  trying to be good, wanting to be bad and so on  &nbsp;   **para SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS**            Wednesday Addams...isn't she lovely?
This is a caricature of my grade school directress Mother Loreto of the Alcatraz like Dominican Catholic School.  When I was seven, I thought nuns were God's interns sent to Earth to spread holy atrocities. I thought they were immortals...angels minus the wings and that funny illuminated ring circling their heads...the type Roby Rosa junkies used to wear in Menudo concerts. One dog day afternoon, I was standing in the school quadrangle alone, the maid 30 minutes late from picking me up, both of my knees smudged with classroom platform filth. Then there she was, a towering 5'10", clad in her immaculate white attire, her smooth veil revealing her pallid face and part of her white earlobes. Then I saw something that scared the hell off me. Her earlobes bore earring holes! Mother Loreto was human! What a cruel trick this dang Catholic School had played on us all.  Then I witnessed her pig out in all of our annual school Christmas parties, wave at the spoiled brats in their neatly pressed uniforms after dismissal time, a nonchalant, listless expression written across her face. Each morning, after the daily rosary, she would proceed to yelling opprobriously at the janitors, her saliva showering down on the pretty heads of Memories of Paradise nodding at her feet. I examined broken Jesus in His cross laying on Mother Loreto's bosom. He looked forlorn--all despondent, all disconsolate. I thought--why it sure is difficult hanging on like that  all wounded . On second thought, I pondered, Jesus' sorry disposition was possibly inspired by the toxic combination of Mother Loreto's halitosis and constitutional viciousness.  It was then that I learned my first lesson on  irony .
