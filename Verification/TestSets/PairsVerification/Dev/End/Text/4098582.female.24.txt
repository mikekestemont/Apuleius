for this job 'cause, wow, that's some mouth she has on her face. Now, I can say with quite a bit of confidence that I am a prudent shopper - I bargan, drain out and talk off the salesperson usually. People who know me well feel sorry for the CS agents I ever have to deal with. My cell phone plan is indicative of this fact: I probably have the best, non-plan, individualized for me, Queen Complainer, that Rogers AT&T has to offer without going under as a company. =D In any case, Ms. Dead Sea Products lady talked my EAR OFF for a good 40 minutes. I ended up buying a soap (which I did not intend to buy but was the cheapest item of their line), and NOT buying the mask (which I  had  intended to buy).  I guess buying the soap was just to spite her a bit given her unending information spewl and enthusiasm. The vindictive side of me is pleased because although I did not get the product I wanted (I guess I can always go back another time to pick it up), I know she felt shafted (spending so much time trying to sell me products - I think I know their whole line now) selling me only a bar of soap (for $11.99). The downside is I felt  guilty (!)  for not buying more of her products! Unbelievable nerve.  Just a tip for all your marketers out there: know when to draw the line.

A couple younger guys strutted slowly by, giving us the "eye".  Attendee 1 (to all of us on the balcony) : What are they looking at? Attendee 2: I don't know...(as the boys below continue staring up)... Attendee 2 (yelling out to the boys at the bottom) : Hey! Quit staring! Whaddya looking at? You wanna take this up? Huh? Huh? Attendee 1: Yeah...come on up and we'll settle this! C'mon!!! Attendee 2: Yeah! We'll take you on. You and me. Midnight. Backup Chorus: Yeah, come up and look for us. At midnight. You and Me. My name is J (host who lives there), room number 504. We might look a little different at midnight but we'll settle it nonetheless.  Those guys never did show up, I don't think...but it was funny anyway. Seeing how all of us who were on the balcony shouting stuff below did not stay past midnight and J, the host, was not present when this occured. He might have shot us had he have k
