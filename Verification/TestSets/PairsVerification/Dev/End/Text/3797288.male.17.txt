my uncles computer, and succeded! Then i started to back up all of his stuff, and i finished that today. Then i went to work at 5, and got screwed on dough b/c waller made it the day before and sorted it again, i want to kill that jackass, but i finished at 9:30, which was surprisingly early. I hate being so fast at doug b/c 2 days a week that all i go in for so its almost like a waste of my time when i only go in for an hour 1/2- 2 hours, but what am i going to do about it. I finally asked, i put it off for a while, im not sure why, but i got a yes.  And today, im bored out of my mind b/c no one wants to do anything b/c they all have to go to work. Hopefully my buiding trades class at school wont be to labor intensive b/c im going to be working 5 days a week again. I also hope the ms coco did fruck up my schedule again b/c im only sopossed to have 4 classes this year , and i dont wish to have to fight with her again, b/c she always says its not her fault! I got nothin else to say for now, c ya bitch's
i didnt do to much today, there was just nothing to do. i went to lowes to get some tile, and then to sears hardware to get some more paint for the basment, and that was about it. It was just another boring day, bo one wanted to do anything b/c they were all working, and i didnt want to do anything by myself, so i stayed home, I HATE MY LIFE!!!!!
I didnt do to much today, i went out to eat at the mouse head and the n i went to sears hardware to get some primer for the basement, and im going back tomorrow to get the paint. Well for those of u that know ive been putting something off for a while now, im not sure why, maybe its the fear of being rejected again, but im going to do it this weekend. Im off again tomorrow so im not sure what im going to do yet, so if u want to do anything let me know!
Lets see, about all i did today was be on my computer, went bowling, and watched beverly hills cop 3. I stayed on my computer most of the day b/c yesterday my power was out from the time i got home from work untill 3:15 in the morning, so i had something i had to take care of.
