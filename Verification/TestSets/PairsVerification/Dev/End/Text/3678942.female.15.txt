away when we saw some cop cars coming up, "oh finally they come." I say so I tell the cop to go up to another cop car. So he does and we roll the windows down and I tell them that I exited all the people out and they just need to get rid of the tigers where they tell us back that they have people from the zoo coming.   Then while we were just about to leave the block I tell the cop guy to turn around and he ask why? and I go, "we forgot about the neighbors" the cop understands at once and drives back to the neightbor where I run over to the neighbor and tell them to call everyone at the block (for they know everyones number) which they did and told them to evacute their houses. Where I gave them directions to go to (the Phipps house, it's close by but far away from the Tigers)" So next thing you hear is people sneaking out to their cars with their children slamming the doors and leaving, with tigers rawring and people from the zoo trying to capture them.      Then I grabbed the cops sleeve and went, "let's go" Dallon was still in the car.  Well the cop was driving to the phipps house when I told him we shouldn't go there, we should go straight to the hospital. Which we did.   When we got to the hospital I stayed with Dallon while they were giving him immediate aid, the cut was deep, and I also spoke to the cop. went something like this.  "thank you so much, you don't know how much you helped" (me) "you helped some too you know" (cop) "na'ah, but if it wasn't for you everyone here would have to wait longer and seeing that door bust down.. we made it just in time, tahnks to you. You should be rewarded or something" (me) "if it wasnt' for you everyone would be dead, your neighbors would be still in their house, and dallon would be worse than harmed from that baby tiger" (cop) "wow" (me) "yes, wow indeed" (cop) then I started talking about his job and how was it and paper work and then I asked about his age "how old are you? you like you are in your twenties" (me) "I'm twenty straight up" (cop) "arn't cops supposed to be in their thirties and fourties and fat and not good looking?" (me) "now your being steorotype" (cop) -=laughter=- "sorry" (me) "no problem" (cop is laughing too) So then it's like midnight and Dallon has a broken arm and thirteen stitches. So I pick Dallon up and carry him to the cop car where he drives us to the Phipps house. Later on all the tigers have left and everyone went back to their house. The cop looked at me and said this, "next time it'll be bears" and he kissed me on the forehead and left that was my dream.... Well today will be a normal day as u
