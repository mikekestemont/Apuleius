    The world hath not stopped for me. Nobody had.   Still, I am perplexed. After what I did, do I even DESERVE her? Even as a friend? How could I possibly believe that we could be together. After all this time, after all this rejection, after all this hardship, what made me think that there was a feasable chance?  Desperation.  I got braces today. I have a face full of steel, and now all I can taste is blood.  I don't even have beauty anymore.   I have to have her love. I can't let even a miniscule chance go to waste. If even for one second, I lose that chance, and opportunity arises, I will never forgive myself. I can never look at another woman. I can never be with another woman.  I remember the last time I tried to fall out of love with her. The last time I tried to fall out of love with her I nearly blew my head off.

She loves me not.  There is not a chance.  God, please stop fucking with my mind.  Sincerely,  Matt.  P.S. Cut and paste is for the sane.
I've got this impending sense of doom. One I cannot shake.  Doom lies straight ahead.  Then again, if I got a strange feeling every time somebody was about to meet their doom, I would be feeling it all the t
