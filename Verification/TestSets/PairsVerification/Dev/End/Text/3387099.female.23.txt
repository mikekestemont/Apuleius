and the stench of that sealant they're putting on the walkways... migraine-inducing.  i had noticed yesterday that they had begun working on the walkway running in an L-shape past the front doors of the apartments on the 4th floor (my floor). yeah, it's a little inconvenient to not come up or go down the stairwell i'd normally use (because you can't walk through their little area when they're working, only on either side of it), but there are three stairwells all in all, and i can use any of them. but having a drill going above my head at eight in the fucking morning on the one day i've had off in two weeks when i want to sleep in really was the icing on the cake of my week.  i can, sort of, still get in and out my front door. and since i wasn't able to sleep, i decided to do a little summer cleaning on my apartment. considering i don't think i've taken out my recycling since before i left for London. (hey, at least i recycle. gimme a break.) but there's a lot of it, and it takes a lot of trips to get it all out of my apartment. i'm getting a sick sort of pleasure in going in and out of my apartment a half dozen times, because the guy out there with the drill is conscientious enough to  stop  drilling every time i walk out. (he really is about three feet away from my door with that drill. and i have no fucking clue why, but he's drilling  up .) so, i walk out, he stops drilling. i walk back to let myself in, he stops drilling. it's a fun little game.  but, seriously, what am i supposed to do? i mean, there's only one way in and out of my apartment, and they're practically blockading it.  oh! oh! oh! and  then , i go to put all that stuff from my living room back out on the balcony area, because they're totally done with it and everything. so i move stuff around to get the back door open, since i've got it blocking the door (i couldn't go out of it for two weeks, anyway), and i open the door... and there is a strip of yellow caution tape spanning the door way at about chest height. wtf?! i duck under the caution tape and drag my stuff out to the balcony anyway.  somehow, "we're sorry for the inconvenience" just doesn't cut it.
urlLink    fresh tex.  urlLink     after an exhilarating (and, at times, exhausting) road trip that covered... not all... not most... but quite a bit more of the country than  i'd  ever seen, this has got to be my favorite photo. apparently, somone's chicken mcnuggets were a little  too  fresh that day i actually spotted a  dead bird  in the garbage can at a gas station in Alanreed, Texas. (which, if the story my pictures tell is accurate in its order of places we visited, is in the eastern part of the p
