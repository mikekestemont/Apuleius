They were supposed to have the money in the account yesterday. Grcmnky said to give them a day to pay it and then call. I call today and D informs me that they had this problem with the check deposit cleared up last week and that they won't have the money to pay us until Friday! WTF??? The agreement was to pay us back when they had the check cleared. Not spend our money and pay us when it is convenient. We need that money for making a down-payment. I didn't think it was a good idea to lend out the money, but grcmnky insisted that he should help out family. Well, no more. I won't allow it. I don't care if I look like a bitch. N is known for spending beyond her means, and so is D. They filed bankruptcy 2 years ago because they couldn't handel their finances.   It didn't teach them much of a lesson, grcmnky &amp; I are both waiting to see how long it takes them to have either their truck, van, or house re-possesed because they can't pay their bills.
Monster Man informs me that SIL's (N) friends (S & S) son (C) told him that grcmnky isn't his daddy, but that he is Miss Thangs daddy!  This is true, but we wanted to wait until Monster Man was a bit older to explain this to him.  We've mentioned it a bit, but haven't gone into too much detail as he is only 4.75 years old.  I want to know why they were even discussing this around C, he's only a few months older than Monster Man.  It's not their place, or their kids place to tell Monster Man this!   How would they feel if I or Monster Man told their daughter (J) that S isn't her father?  She's 9, and they don't intend on telling her anytime soon (I don't think they ever intend on it, they want to wait until the time is right.  There isn't really a right time.).  They'd be pissed if someone told on them like that.  Just like N would be pissed if I or Monster Man told her daughter (M) that BIL (D) isn't her father.  Or if we told D's family that he isn't M's father.  They've even lied to them about it.  N was 2 months pregnant when her and D got together.  His name is even on the birth certificate.  But you don't see us discussing these matters around our children, or tatteling on them because it's not appropriate.  This just adds on to the reasons I want to stay away from S&S and their kids.  It's proving to be a damn near impossibility because N is constantly having them over to her house, and fails to inform us when she does.  Grcmnky doesn't want to deprive the kids of seeing family, so we go.  I will be so fucking happy when we move out of this damned town and away from these idiots!!  If we don't live nearby, we won't have to see t
