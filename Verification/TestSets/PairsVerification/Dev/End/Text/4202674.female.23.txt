I now feel much better about being a lazy bum on the weeknights.          Now...for those of you who are smart enough to realize there are still two weekends before school...coconut covered cookies for you! Yes, I am well aware of this second weekend! But, as with this weekend, I bartered it away last week, agreeing to teach a guard camp friday night and saturday morning before rushing the 2+ hours home and trying to tame my poor afro into something presentable in public for the bachelorette party. (Hint hint, anyone wishing to help me in the taming of the 'fro is welcome at my house!!!)           Okay...venting done (for the moment) I will now be rejoining my currently scheduled programming (filing...yay)
So, it's been pointed out that I didn't talk enough about school. :-) So, the plan is to double major in Astronomy and Physics at KU. Wish me luck!!          Anyway, I'm quite enjoying my last 2 weeks of freedom, so there's really not much to say...last night, let's see...I...ate dinner, read for a while, and crocheted for a while! WHOO HOO!!! I'm spent, BEDTIME! *LOL* I did at least RSVP for the bachlorette party, LAST BIG PARTY!!! I can't WAIT!!! I guess we're going to the Outhouse, then up to D&amp;D. Boobies and liquor! Don't you wish you could go? :-)          And now, bright and early (7:00am....YUCK!!!) I'm here at work, enjoying some early morning chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream. *LOL* Don't you want to be me?

Okay, so, I'm starting this out of boredom, and rest assured, within a few days (or weeks) you'll stop reading it for the same reason. :-)   So....since I'm never good when put on the spot, and have a tendency to ramble, please, bear with me. I'm assuming that since you got this address, you already know me, and to those I apologize, because I'm going to backtrack a bit for the others who have been out of touch a bit.  Let's see. I am now officially 23, I live with my boyfriend Jason in Lawrence, I work at a Bolt and Nut distributor, I drive a ford, (EWWWWWWW!!!! I can't believe I just said that...shoot me someone!), I start school in 2 weeks, I choreograph winterguard for Northwest Missouri State University (though, we've got more than a few CMSU kids joining, so I suppose I have to call it "Express" now, like everyone else....blah) and just got roped into choreographing fall and winterguard for Sherman High School....wherever that is. Let's see...I currently have about a billion guppies (anyone want some?) and have been promised a kitten (hint hint, Jason). I am also the most dreadful, horrendous, awful maid of honor for my best friend's wedding (please forgive me Lis!), but I'm working on that :-)  I have 11 piercings, and 7 tattoos.   Okay, so I can't think of anymore background at the moment, so I guess I'll stop rambling. If anyone can think of anything earthshattering to add, please remind me..ya'll know I have the memory (and attention span) of a g
