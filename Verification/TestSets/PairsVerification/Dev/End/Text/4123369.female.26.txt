feel like a stray, slave, servant in their presence. I am really so tired, so lonely, so wounded. Years of abuse, the wounds does not heal easily and fast. Old wounds are again tored up by my mom. She enjoys bringing up past issues that I tried to forget. Am I really that a person she said I am?
So tired, Yet I can't sleep. So weak,  Yet I can't rest. So stressed out, Yet I can't relax. I stare into darkness, waiting for sandman to come. Only at dawn, That I will sleep. Only at day,  That I will rest. Only at sunrise, That I will relax. I cried into noon, waiting for life to come. Why can't I hope for hopes, Cause Despair came. Why can't I seek for seeks Cause Lost came. Why can't I dream for dreams, Cause Dreamcatcher came.
During school days, I treated her as my little friend. One whom I would protect and respect. I taught her passion, friendship and love. After graduation, she went to nanyang polytechnic. She was slacking and lacking. I pushed her, made her stand, but she slack. She enjoyed life, attentions and activities. I was scared, but I am glad to see her happy.

At the eleventh hour she would either forgotten about our plans, or she would cancel it to make time for her other friends. I was of course sad and disappointed, I grumbled and complained. But still I miss her. I would share my joy and sadness with her, she used to share with me hers. Slowly as we matured, She drifted away from us. She would gave us the lowest priority, I would always be placed on the waiting list. I cried and was confused, did I do anything wrong? Was I so undesirable as her Friend? But still at my lowest hour, I would go to her  and she would come to me at her lowest point. Things went really bad after she met John........
I sometimes miss him. I would pretend that I did not see him, even though I know he is there. I would glance around to seek him. But I pretend I was just curious about my surroundings. When he smiles at me, my heart would flutter in silence. His sms messages and emails are treasures to me. I would read them over and over again, as they provide me strength and motivation for the days ahead. He might not know, but I do hold his happiness dear to my h
