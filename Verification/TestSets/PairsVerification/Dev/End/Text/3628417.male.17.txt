especially on a sunday.  Eh... things are so depressing.
i went to the hair doctor and she did a little snip snip snip on my hair, but when i say little i really mean it because it was just a trim.  i'm growing it out, but i guess she wanted it to be all one length for when i grow it out, which isn't really what i wanted.  but ohhhh well.    i also went to the doctor and got my fifth and final shot of the year.  well, hopefully the final shot.  zac went back with me and held my hand and i was telling the nurse how anna and i made a big show about getting the first couple shots at school.  hehe.  anna are you okay, say anna are you okay, are you okay anna?  you've been hit by, you've been struck by,  a smoooooth criminal.
before i start this post, i must say one thing: YAY FOR PWESANTS AND PUTT-PUTT AND NIMH AND GREENTREE AND ZACHARY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  my zachary is leaving me for a wee bit to venture back to the mother land.  i was going to go with him but my doctoroonski must see me tomorrow so i couldn't join the loverly moomer.  i got my apple powerbookie!!  so hopefully this will keep me entertained while zachary's gone because anna is gone too and alee is a workaholic.  and is also probably flustered with college things coming up.  poor moo.  the powerbook is extremely loverly and fun except it is a bitch to transfer all my music files, picture files, and other documents and the like over.  especially with the music files because about half of my music was in .wma format which is used only by windows, so i've been converting files and recopying cd's a lot today.  i also am poopered about the fact that i can't view yahoo launch videos unless i have netscape 4.7x, so i downloaded it, but it is fucking shitty and gross and lame and angerfying.  so i decided i'll have to make do without yahoolaunch.  i also kind of hate how aim runs on this thing.  it's pretty retarded.  and the no-gaming thing is also a swift kick in the face as well.    HOWEVER, i still am loving this little computer and, for the most part, how apple does things.  i still think it's insanely lame that they don't use more than one mouse button as it's extremely convenient to simply right-click, but that's not even as lame as the no scroll-bar-wheelie-thing-a-ma-bob.  i mean, seriously... it's a pain in the ass not to have a scrolling wheel and i see no reason to not put one on the mouse.    but hey, i'm still figuring things out, getting a bit frustrated from time to time of course, but i think that once i really get used to things, i'll adore this machine.  i mean.. i already do, just.. it's still awkward.    but don't worry, zac... i'll always be a pc person at heart.  ;]   imu
HAHA IN YOUR FACE JAUN, HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO M
