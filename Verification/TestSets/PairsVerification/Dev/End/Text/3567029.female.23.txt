fear me at work is a good thing.  But they are viewing me as evil for the wrong things.  I'm a pretty fair person, I try to view things from someone else's perspective when I start to get annoyed at them and see if I'm justified.  This is especially true in any kind of customer service situation.  I am a stickler for customer service.  If I'm paying for it- I expect it to be pretty good.  If its not awesome, I just leave a smaller tip.  If its horrible, I leave about a quarter to show them that I did not forget I just thought they were wretched.  Every now and then something really irks me and I write a letter to upper management.  In all the letters I've written only once have I not received a response.  I recently wrote a letter to my new apartment complex because they told us one thing about the pet fees when we viewed the apartment, and after we paid them non-refundable money they changed it by over $500.  Thats a lot.  I got a pretty quick response (after a couple of nudging phone calls) and it was fixed.  Now, Maggie Moo's has pissed me off, big time by not letting my friend use their restroom.  So has The Cheesecake Factory - more because I want free cheesecake and I'm on a roll rather than they've made me that angry.  Does this make me a heinous bitch, or just kickass because I have the patientce to write letters and get free stuff?
Well! That was one way to bring in August with a bang!  First, HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my friend Kerry!  She turned 21 over the weekend and of course this meant partying hard over the weekend in DC.  Despite the crappy service at the restaurant, and an asshole manager at Maggie Moo's who wouldn't let us  - paying customers - use the bathroom, we had a great time.  I got to see all the lovely people I haven't seen in ages, and party with my girls.  Then I got to go see The Village last night.  It is a great movie - I really liked it a lot.  It's so clever and well-thought out.  It's a lot of fun.  Plus, it was filmed right in my back yard.  By "my backyard" I mean about 5 miles up the road from my backyard.  Close enough.  But before you go to see The Village - don't go into it thinking that its a scary movie.  It's not.  It's not really supposed to be, either.  Its just an interesting story that has some creepy moments.  I think they need to change the advertising on this movie because people go into it thinking its a scary movie and they're disappointed when its not, and the awesomeness of this movie gets lost in between.  Oh, and you know how they do all those ads to tell people to turn their cell phones off.  How dumb do you have to be to watch that and then NOT DO IT!  *
