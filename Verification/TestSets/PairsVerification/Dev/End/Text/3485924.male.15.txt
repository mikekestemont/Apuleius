sitting here... Being bored... Well, not really, I just can't focus on writing.   Meh... life's creul twists are only made worth it by the fortuitous ones that happen...   Yeah, well, I found a new craze to myself. Called FFX!!! Yeah, stop playing one, start playing another Final Fantasy. I love the game. It really is fun, because I just imported all of the Al Bhed Primers that I had in my old game (being all of them ;P) and now I fully understand what everyone is saying. There are some plot holes that are kinda weird when you PERFECTLY understand Al Bhed, but I don't really care. I can't wait to get to the end and become all super godly powerful ^^. Lalalala.   You know (probably not), I'm actually kind of tired. I feel really pansy right now... I'm so out of it... I haven't played DDR in so long. I really need my metal pad, but birthday is so far away... I'll just have to live it out. Hopefully I can get everyone to the arcade sometime so that I don't stab out my eyes in the lacking of dancing-ness...steth...   Okay, well, I think I'm done. I'm already like 24 hours behind on this thing, so the faster I publish, the faster it'll be... uh... published... Well, I'll talk to you all on Wednesday ^_^.   PS: Yes! You heard right! Wednesday, it will not be on Thursday (I think >.>;)
Yeah... these last couple of days...  Nothing has really happened at all.  Unless you count me gettin my stuff something, then there's nothing.  I really haven't had time to play the games since i got them, but I will.  I'll give you all an update when I do begin playing them ^^;  Well... there is SOME news.  Alex is back, and I'm happy.  Finally, last week was boring as hell... and it passed by really slowly too.  Alex was gone, and Sahil's been gone for two weeks at this awesome camp (more about that later though).  Then... it was just boring.  Nothing to do really.  Nick did come one day to my house (Nick Kish) but he just stayed for a small bit.  I just hope that when Sahil comes back that we can all have one like... big get together and have tons of fun like we did when summer first came ^^  Yeah, so, like I said, Sahil is in a really cool camp.  I wish I could've gone, but it's probably too expensive anyways o.O;;  The camp that he goes to isn't really a camp, though.  It's more like taking summer classes in a university... but cool summer classes ^^  He's taking some like... phylosophical science or something (I can't remember the name ^_^;).  Basically, it's like college, but at high school age and really cool classes.  So in other words, it's awesome*!  Well... that's it.  If you want more just go read about  urlLink cocks and pussies  somewhere else :P  I'll see you all later (hopefully with some news >.>;;)  *Refer to the prementioned statement of a
