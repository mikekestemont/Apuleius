is not the only one bearing scars. The young boy fears his mother's fate, particularly at his brutal, alcoholic father's ( urlLink Jon Bon Jovi ) hands. The mother also bears scars from her childhood with a homeless, alcoholic mother ( urlLink Angie Dickinson ).  Yes, the movie had a decent story line - but Helen Hunt's only saving grace are her looks, she certainly can't act. Although she certainly did a decent job looking like she was enjoying the little lap dance she did! Kevin Spacey plays a decent role - only slightly less gay than he's played in the past. I think Keven's best character was in  The Usual Suspects.   Haley - well, it's Haley. He plays the little do-gooder that I love to hate.  In all, this one gets a **.  Legend: ***** Helen Hunt and Natalie Portman doing a lesbo scene. **** Helen Hunt doing a lap dance for you. *** Helen Hunt naked. ** Kevin Spacey naked. * Kevin Spacey and Jay Mohr doing a gay scene. Thanks, guys. That's a piece of my brain I'll never get back.
"Equilibrium" truly gives "The Matrix" a run for its money. It may not be as revolutionary, and it was certainly made on very limited coffers (in film terms, that is, with a budget of about twenty million dollars), but this movie nonetheless has it all: heart, soul, brains, and more than its fair share of visceral action. It is this combination of the dramatic, the cerebral, and the intense that makes "Equilibrium" one of the best action films of its kind, and one of the very best films released in 2002 (though Dimension, for whatever reason, opted for a limited release, which may be why you've never heard of it up until now).  The always versatile and vastly talented Christian Bale plays John Preston, an emotionless enforcer (or Cleric) who arrests, and more often murders, those known as "Sense Offenders" - people who refuse to obey the laws of the futuristic regime, which has made illegal all forms of artistic expression, and even emotion itself. Emotion is regulated by daily drug use, and those who refuse to indulge are summarily executed. But when Preston kills his partner (played by Sean Bean, who so effortlessly portrayed Boromir in "The Lord of the Rings") for displaying unusual sentiment and misses his own required inducement of the emotion-quelling drug, he realizes that perhaps he is fighting for the wrong team.  "Equilibrium" feels like John Woo's take on "Fahrenheit 451" or "Brave New World," and it's absolutely astounding. Though at times "Equilibrium" may be guilty of mimicking "The Matrix," it sometimes outshines its forebear, and is every bit as compelling, its world every bit as believable (if not more so). Like "The Matrix," "Equilibrium" makes a powerful statement, and despite its splendidly choreographed action segments (which are revolutionary in their own right), it is a film with brains and brawn alike, and should not be missed. At last, despite all of its immitators, "The Matrix" has a worthy adversary in the g
