took the three plugs from the center speaker and put them into my computer and booted up. And what did I hear? NOTHING! I had to go buy a sound card. So the next day I went to Frys and picked up a SoundBlaster Live! 5.1 for 20 bucks. Put it in my computer installed drivers. and hooked up my speakers and I went to my first test. Battlefield 1942. I could hear the planes around me in the air and I could hear bombs being dropped around me. I could hear the tank shells hit me. I could hear the explosions of planes with amazing sound! Then I decided to test the sub woofer it took awhile before my parents left so I could crank up the volume but I just did and WOW. Superb sound in the highs the mid range and in the lows.   In the end.  These speakers were a great upgrade from the crappy $10 ones I had. and for $60 they were a great deal. It even helps me in game because I can hear people sneaking up behind me to try to get a knife kill.   They have Oompas Seal Of Approval.   I LOVE YOU MY LOGITECH Z640S!
Man this dog rocks
