They sent me to a fairly good public school and funded my college education. When I turned 12 or 13 they bought me an electronic word processor because they knew I liked to write. When I got to college, they bought me a laptop computer.  Now here I am. I have a job. A writing job. I haven't asked them, but I suspect my parents are satisfied by the outcome of my life thus far.

Which is difficult for me to swallow because I really think that so much of who I am has to do with family and history.  Then again, I had to cover a hearing on drug abuse yesterday and one of the treatment providers said the biggest problem he faces is convincing kids who grew up in families where drug use was the norm that they don't have to be like their relatives.
This is Jake.    Jake doesn't like getting into the truck. Chris and Karen dragged him in anyway.    They went to Lapakahi State Park in North Kohala.    But Lapakahi State Park is a historical park and dogs aren't allowed on the beach. Poor Jake. He had to stay in the truck.    Then Chris, Karen and Jake went to Hawi Town in North Kohala. Poor Jake had to stay in the truck again, because Karen wanted to shop.  This time, though, Jake jumped out of the truck and ran up the road after Chris. Chris had to catch him and put him back in the truck. Again.    Finally, Chris, Karen and Jake went home. It was about time. Jake was tired.   The e
