she ready for a change? Without a doubt. But, did she still do her job every day until God opened up the most incredible job-door in the world for her? You better believe it. She did it for God, and He blessed her with a great opportunity.  If everyone who was 'so unhappy' in their situation did what she did--do it for God and constantly seek other opportunities--then I don't think people would be as miserable as they are now.  Anyway, that's my gripe today. Instead of complaining about how your job isn't what you think it should be, do the job you're supposed to do. The rewards will come when you make the job you've been given, no matter how little it is, and do it as if it were the most important thing in the world.
Wonderful Together  Okay, I'll admit it...I had a wonderful time this weekend.  Tim and I celebrated our 1-year anniversary.  That's right, now we're one of those couples who has been together for more than a year.  Completely cheesy to get excited about, I know, but whatever.  I'm young and I'm in love so there! :)  Yes, Tim and I had a great weekend.  We both took Friday off and went to Dayton to the  urlLink United States Air Force Museum .  If you've never been and you enjoy airplanes and the history of how man got off the ground, then you should check it out.  Open seven days a week, that's right...and it's free!  There should be more free things like this in the world.  :)  Anyway, we spent all of Friday at the museum and then headed to Donato's for dinner.  That was special because we ate at Donato's the week before we started dating...as friends. :)  Then all of Saturday we spent back at the museum, seeing the stuff we had missed the day before.  We  thought  we were going to have to go through 1 hanger, but it turned out there was another one that wasn't on the map...so yeah, more than we thought, which is great!  Saturday was the official day and we exchanged gifts and cards, which is always fun.  I think we really know what the other one enjoys, so gift buying is always fun (although can be stressful, I will admit) and exchanging is always exciting.  In fact, I am the proud new owner of a Serta Sheep!  Okay, so it's a long story that probably won't be as exciting to anyone but Tim and I, but trust me, I LOVE IT!   After a year, I can say that I love Tim B. Bedwell more than I ever thought I could love another person.  What I feel for him makes anything I had felt in the past seem pale in comparison.  I love his smile, his laugh...the way he makes 'fun' of me and the way he holds me tight.  He's the most amazing person I have ever met in my life, and I can't wait to see what the next year together holds!!  Happy Monday e
