&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  LAS VEGAS, Nevada (AP) -- Hotel heiress Nicky Hilton married a New York money manager before dawn Sunday in an impromptu ceremony, according to court filings obtained by The Associated Press.  Hilton, 20, married Todd Andrew Meister, 33, at the Las Vegas Wedding Chapel, according a Clark County marriage license. A woman who answered the phone at the chapel declined comment.  "Access Hollywood," which first reported the wedding, said older sister Paris Hilton and actress Bijou Phillips were present during the 2:30 a.m. ceremony.  The Hilton sisters were in town for a Stuff magazine party at the Palms Casino Resort, where they were joined by Meister and Nicole Ritchie for dinner late Saturday, resort owner George Maloof Jr. said.  Maloof, who confirmed the ceremony had taken place, said the couple gave no indication of their plans.  Nicky Hilton, younger sister of "The Simple Life 2" star Paris Hilton, has dabbled in acting, appearing in "Wishman" in 1991 and presenting at MTV award shows.

The United States never led after early in the first quarter.  The&nbsp;Americans&nbsp;were down by 22 points at half-time and by 17 points after three quarters. Utah Jazz guard Carlos Arroyo led Puerto Rico with 24 points. Tim Duncan had 15 for the Americans.  Puerto Rico had never beaten the United States in Olympic play, losing all five of its previous matches.

You are Adidas. You wear tight pants, and chances are that you have a very flat butt.
