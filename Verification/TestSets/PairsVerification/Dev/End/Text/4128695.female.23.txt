my back, purring up a little storm as she walked all over me and decided upon a resting spot above my head.   Thank our Lord for Claritin  Liberators .  I'm sitting at the hospital, half working, half not really here... my heart isnt here today, i must have left it in bed.   i had a fantastic conversation, one i plan to reiterate for myself here,  later on today.  I've been told i'm a complicated person alot these days... i dont think thats a bad thing, i think it just means i have to work extra hard to know myself well... and be able to explain my quirks and needs.   there's a beautiful promise i found in a card the other day and i'll end with it for now;    " My Promise to You"      If you're feeling empty inside, i'll fill your heart with favorite you-and-me stories to make you smile     If neither one of us knows what to say, I'll sit quietly with you in the closeness we share what needs no words.     If you start to doubt, I'll help you find your courage again.     If the climb is steep and long, I'll hold your hand and we'll walk each step of the way together.          And if you say, "who cares?" I'll remind you how very much i do.  Because when i say, "i'm here for you" i mean it for as often and as long and in whatever way you need me        I hope that one day i'll be able to stand and look up into the loving eyes of my life partner and say these words to him.  For now, i rest assured that with words that exist so beautifully, there has to be a relationship level that merits their creation.  I want to be so much for that ONE special person.  That want is such a part of my entire being.  I'm content though, knowing that my path will bring me there, and anxious to think that perhaps i'm already in the process of arriving...
I cant help but think that this irritating twitch i've had in my lip all day is trying to tell me something... with so many things going on in my life i cant pin point it... hmmm maybe i'm just potassium deficient...or maybe my lips are just lonely.
I've been a fan of Khalil Gibran's writtings for a long time, i particularly found a reflections of myself and my understandings in the pages of his book  The Prophet.      one of my very favorite passages from its pages;  "  And when he speaks to you, believe in him, though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the garden. For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you. Even as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning. Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your tenderest branches that quiver in the sun so shall he descend to your roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth"           The Prophet on Love (Khalil G
