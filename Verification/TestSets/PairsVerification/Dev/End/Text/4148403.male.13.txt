in helicopters and airplanes) are two blades on the same axle. They are more powerful for less energy. If you made a coaxial propellor inside your flippers you could make dive flippers that propel, but when the battery dies all you have to do is unfold them and use them as regular flippers.
Every diver in the world has had the problem of their mask being fogged up. Right now there's the ability to spit into the mask, then rub it around with your finger. This only works temporarily, and is found "disgusting" to some. The other option is to buy a tube of antifog slime that you rub around the lens to clear it, then rinse out the remains of the goop. This works fine, but is time consuming. The reason fog forms on a mask is that the body heat radiates from your face and condenses against the cold mask lens (cold because of the water around it). On the Antifog Mask, however, there is an extending heat beacon. It heats the water around the mask to keep it from condensing.
The idea for the pool snorkel was very old, but until now I never realized how to make it a possibility. The idea was to have a long (about 4 or 5 feet) flexible rubber snorkel tube that attached to a float at the surface. The reason this couldn't work is that when you breathed in the tube would fill with fresh air, then you would breath out and it would get halfway out, then breath in again. You're breathing in the air you just breathed out. A very simple way to fix this problem is to put two purge valves near the mouth. You breath in, and it comes in from the tube, but since there's the purge valves, you breathe out, and it goes out an exit valve to the side of the snorkel.
