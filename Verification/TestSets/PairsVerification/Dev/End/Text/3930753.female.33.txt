feel at the end of this project.&nbsp; I had better love this color, I haven't a clue how to remove or cover up sandwash.
Have you ever wondered if one thing in your life had been different what effect it would have had on your present and the present of others.   Had I not flounder in college from one degree to another I never would have ended up at NIU.  Had I not gone to Northern and been bored with no friends, I would never had joined Sigma Lambda Sigma Sorority.  Had I not done this I would never have meet Janenne and then introduced her to my brother who fell head over heels with her after their first conversation.  They have been together for 10 years and married for 6.  When I moved to Tsaile in 1998 I never thought I would meet Stace.  What a friend I have in her.  She helped me through emotional times when an abusive relationship made me question my worth and exsitance.  The time we had on the Navajo Nation and the stories we share bind us closer than any rope.  My adventure in Arizona lead me to look up an old friend from my high school days, Justin. After months of sharing our woes and bearing our inadaquacies (or at least I did)he helped me realize what a wonderful and beautiful person I am.  With my self esteem restored I took a chance and found my Anam Cara or Soul Friend, Mark.   These two individuals who helped make me who I am, brought me strength and taught me so much about myself found each other at my wedding.  How crazy is this world.  Had they not nutured me when I was in need and stood by me on the happiest day of life they never would have meet.  Now they start a journey that can go anywhere they take it.  If they display courage and honesty it can lead to a world of happiness and self knowledge.  If they run and are fearful they will stay where they are and mourn the loss of what could have been if only.....................  My husband also amazes me.  This gentle and selfless man loves me. WHY?  I am the sun and moon to him, or so our personal joke goes.  Why?  Every night he comes to bed and wants me, even after he has seen my naked fat rolls.  This man who I truly am blessed to have knows my bad habits, at times nasty temperment, and still he loves me.  He loves me even though I am a horrible house cleaner, lazy and a know it all.  Sometimes I wonder if he's on drugs.  Most of the time I just love him even more for just putting up with me.  Isn't life amazing.....I meet Justin in High School....flounder in college...introducing my brother to his wife..... Move to Tsaile and become friends with Stace.....Reup my friendship with Justin which leads me to my husband.....which lets Stac and Justin meet.  Who ever said their wasn't a master p
