as I momentarily slipped back into the light slanting in to the dorm, and us walking through, and a glimpse of someone that I once kissed and later feared.  After that first semester I was a little tougher then I was before, not much though.    There is a beer bottle on the desk, half full, a forty.  It has been here for over a month.  Dead Guy Ale, Rogue.  It was left here by a roommate, and is still here, even though I have thought of moving it.  Ah.  A girl in a purple shirt got out of the car after it loitered for five minutes.  Then the car sped off, going too fast for a small kid oriented street.  Good bye white car.  May all the things you have coming to you return in full.  Damn it.  I think that I'm lonely.  Has this string of people in my life caused me to forget what it is to be alone?  Alone is fine.  We do alone okay, don't we?  We don't need eyes meeting ours, we don't need human touch, we don't need someone to cry to.  We don't need.  Everything is provided for us, everything comes, will come.

Noise and sound and soul searing pleasure.  That pleasure flew away yesterday, and I felt weak and empty when it left.  What more to write, what more to leave blinking from your screen?  It has not been bright, but nothing is all the time.  The world was not made that way, for some reason I must assume.  I will take a journal to the park and watch people moving in their mundane lives and maybe get a bit of a kick out of it.  Maybe my sister will buy me a hot dog and I will feel American.  Maybe.  Maybe I will find some kind of detailed wonder yet unimaginable by my tiny world.  Maybe.  There is a sound now, it was a horn calling in the day, just like the sound of the horn in the lord of the rings.  What a strange thing to cut through the day.  It gives me hope that somewhere there are orcs attacking, and that it wont be such a boring day at a
