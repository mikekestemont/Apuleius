says that he is mad at Bush for stop-loss…” “No see, he said that he thinks it would be a slap in the face to vote for Kerry…” and so on...   I notice reading the posts that many try to slip in their views --scantily veiled in ‘concern’…”CB, I am undecided, but vote Kerry so maybe you can home quicker.” In some small way maybe we all want him to justify all that we have said-- for or against the war.    ME: Dad, have you read the soldier blog that is linked to my site yet?  DAD: It takes me long enough to read everything on yours.  ME: Read his instead then, you will love it…read his. Ya know what he said the worst pick up line in Iraq is?  DAD: What?  ME: Are you a terrorist, cause you da bomb….    Here is a person that I have never met…a person who has no first name…no face…yet a friend. His words have become so familiar –so anticipated. He seems to be the embodiment of all that is good in this country. A hero….yet he is often blunt, disgruntled…and human. A visitor to his site once pointed out that the ‘hawks’ were overlooking glaring signs that say, “Anti-war” –the painting choice, the link to Hunter Thompson…but I think that’s what I find so wonderful. He seems mad about the war sometimes –yet the next day touched by a gesture from a local. He listens to SOD, but reads Hunter Thompson. He comes from a republican family –yet contemplates a vote for Nader.   ME: Do you think more than one person writes CB’s page?  JUSTROSE: Why?  ME: Because he just doesn’t make sense. Hunter Thompson said that he would rip off the heads and piss down the neck of this Nazi administration….  JUSTROSE: No, it’s just him…   I disagree with those who constantly tell him to go to school for writing/journalism. Academia will steal his edge and attempt to reign in his raw talent and passion. His writing is real and prompts many of us to respond with words of comfort and well-wishes each day.  The things that many of us say/want to say to him –“We are proud of you”, “Stay safe”, “Thank you for what you are doing”…seem to ring hollow typed in the comments section of the blog…but I know they are all truly from each person’s heart.  There is no figuring this soldier out –and that’s why he is everyone’s soldier…he is our soldier.  *For anyone that hasn’t read CBFTW’s site –please do at http://cbftw.blogspot.com/
