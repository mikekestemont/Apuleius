to, it's difficult for me to trust her for no particular reason.  Additionally, she has enough issues to deal with that I don't feel the need to burden her with mine.  Stalker: Not a friend and not an enemy.  I thought I'd hate him with an undying passion and balmed all my problems on him when I had only blamed him because I didn't see other places the blame could go (myself, Ex, etc...).  We're not that great of acquaintences and I'd never trust him with anything said here.  The best word I can come up with for our relationship is: tolerance.  I'm willing to set aside my ideas and talk with him than I am with, say, the new boyfriend.  That's all.  NB: Standing for new boyfriend (I'd have used BT but decided against it.  Ten points if you can guess why ;) ), he's the only person I hate and everyone knows why.  I'm not gonna go into it myself, you can read the other posts here for that.   That's all the people that will be reffered to as the story of my sad life goes on.  I know I left out a few of you, so don't IM me about it :D.  These are the people for whom I might need to refer to for storytelling about the events of the past few months.  Don't think I don't consider you friends, these guys are the ones for whom there could be confusion and I'm just trying to clarify.  My sad little world has expanded into a universe now!  'Later Andy
I had my last counselor meeting today (for the school year at least).  I told her about the new revised "hate list" and she said that it isn't a personality trait he has that I don't, his personality is more compatible with her than mine is/was (I'll withhold my comments on THAT subject though :D).  I feel like I won't find the right person for me, but that's just because this has happened so recently and certainly hasn't helped me feel that great about myself.  Doesn't make me hate him any less.  The more I watch of him, the more about him I hate.  Example: Today, we had a fire drill.  I watched him "sneak" (by sneak, I mean crouched low to the ground and moving quickly) up to the group of people he (and whom I used to) hangs out with, pops up, obviously says "Where is she?", "sneaks" off, and finds her.  I honestly don't believe he can go longer than five minutes without seeing/touching/talking with her.  I'm amazed he can get through an entire class period...  We'll leave his life, to which I'd love to see burn and razed onto the ground :D, and say that eventually, this site will change.  For now, I just need to rant and rave.  Shouting into the vastness of the internet is nice.  When I get the time to, I'll post bios of my friends (names?  maybe "nicknames").  For now, I've got a presentation to make for English.  'Later A
