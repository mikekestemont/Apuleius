 Croatia 0-0 Switzerland    France vs England  14/06/04 KO 0245 --->Premiership Champion against England France's trio Veira, Pires and Henry have know England's players playing style by heart. This can help them for this game. In other words, France can be the one celebrating if luck do not help England a bit. France seldom lose their matches ever sice they are crowned as world champion but of course draw may not be avoid. Rooney is the key in this game. He can be the one who can win this opening game for England if he can perform at his peak. England backline is fragile which could cause them the game if France can find the net early in this game. Don't forget England always perform better when they are the underdog.  PR: Draw is more appropriate for this game. Receiving +ball will be recommended.  Result:  France 2-1 England
Portugal vs Greece  12/06/04 KO 2359  --->Home team against a fast improved team in last 6 months.  Greece has shown improvement in away matches since their last failure to go into WC2002. Pratically a proven giant killing team in their home of Greek. Advantage on playing in hot weather and always perform well against the odds in the qualifying round especially against the mighty Spainards. As for Portugal, home soil advantage can be the winning factor in this opening game. With Figo, Rui Costa, Jorge Costa and various stars playing in big european team, they will perform well if they can forget what had happened two years back in Korea. Young players from the European Cup winners FC Porto will have all the confidence to perform at the peak of their talent. Don't forget Solari still have the winning formula that he bring back the world cup for Brazil in the last world cup.   PR: Greece to hold Portugal for a goaless result or a narrow win for the home teams. Receiving +ball will be recommended.  Result:  Portugal 1-2 Greece    Spain vs Russia  13/06/04 KO 0245 --->Neutral ground match up Don't even think Spain will be playing at home standard in this game against the big-sized roulette as the Spainard will most likely lose all the high ball challenge in this game. Russian will overcome the odds if the central mastermind Mostovio and side wizard Karpin could deliver world class passes into the Spainard safeguard area. Spain, a born loser in major tournament, might break the curse again. They did show the world in last world cup but without experienced backline hold by Hierro(retired) and company, this could be another upset for the Spanish supporters if the new backline failed to clear the high balls bombarded by the Russian troop. Just a trick from Morientes can bring glory to Spain if he's not properly man-marked.  PR: A 50-50 game in my opinion and odds for Russia has hugh return. Receiving +ball will be recommended.  Result:  Spain 1-0 Russia
