Well its not for those who read slow or are bored of life...cause its 800 pages...so dont bother....well i knw i will...its really nice....had gone to Dars today....wasnt gonna go at first...was gonna go to a doc for an appointment to deal with the corns...well let him just take em off...id rather bear the pain once than everyday:P...but i cudnt fix an appointment...stoopid busy doctor...newayz...well cause i cudnt fix an appointment...i went for Dars...and was then gonna go for arshus bros waleema...if i spelled it right tht is...newayz...work came up...and then i got too lazy :P....

Ya aight!!! dun even comment on it...i knw the match was completely sri lankas the moment india started batting...my dad was right....which ever match tendlia played well in this tournament...we lost...now thts lame i knw...but a fact too!!! I really dunno wht others think but the last few overs were kinda fun to watch...zaheer blasted 2 towering sixers off murali....tht was some good stuff...i mean come on at time when they were almost 150 for 7 who wudve imagined tht india wud even cross the 200-mark...      But newayz i loved...nothing abt this match:P...simply because india lost...and also cause there wasnt a single knock tht was worth praising be it sachins or marvans....though atapattu was playing a much better game than tendulkar...im so frustrated i dun even feel like watching the presentation...whts the point neway...newayz im sure pakis are pretty happy today...well cant stop em only warn em tht their tour of australia is in 3 days...so they dont have much time to rejoice....but i am on pakis side on this tour no matter wht...cause ive always hated the australians...y do they have to play so well...theyve got 3 world cups under their belt....their the best team...wht more do they need...wud it harm them if they were to lose one tourney...ah...nevermind...      Well a hell lot was expected from the indians in this match...but they were a big disappointment...newayz screw tht...hahaha....narutos new episode was awesome or 'sukey' like naruto himself wud put it:P...this weeks episode is even better...oh and yea narutos manga had released too...and tht too was a treat...ah well newayz...last few days havent been tht great...and to top it off india lost the asia cup:P...well tht cup was made in india...in jaipur to be precise...and it deserved to come back home:P...ah newayz...i gotta go...take care ya all...      Allah H
