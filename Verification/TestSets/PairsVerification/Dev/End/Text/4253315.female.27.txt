was a phreaking train wreck. He's married now.  Weird. Broke up when i moved to saskatoon, went into bender after breakup.  3. Ian. [and i still get shudders when i type his name] Spent the summer in van to work...really i spent the summer with IFW. We were inseperable. Morning, evening, night, weekend, weekdays...yah, you get the picture.  All we did was drink, do drugs, and fuck.  Had crazy ass sex [yeah, read that how you want] became a total freaky chick and got into BDSM, fisting, hardcore anal....uh, thats enough for here.  But it was goood.  Mostly, I loved this guy. After Kel, he was so loving, affectionate, and totally wanted me to be with him all the time.  I felt like i was special and beautiful. We even discussed eloping.  When i went back to saskatoon, he couldnt handle it...we broke up like 12 days after i left.  I lost it.  Drank like a wino and slept around for over a year. Got a big tattoo. Went to Europe the following summer to try to forget him.  Still dunno how id be if i saw him tomorrow.    4.Mark  Dumbass. Fucker. Asshole.  Hey, guess what? Im still a little sore about this one.  He was great, and yeah, i guess i loved him. Or at least who i thought he was.  We worked together and the first month we were  incognito. He seemed like the perfect mix between Ian and Kelly: grounded but fun, and, yeah, I got him into the kinky stuff.  He left at the end of the summer to go back to school. We saw each other one more time after that and something troublesome happened.  And he ran. And I never will forgive him.  The bender never stopped post-Ian, and it continued after Dumbass.   Now... there is the Boy. He's dealing with a lot of emotional wreckage caused by the above assholes.  I worry daily that hes going to be just another one...and i worry even more that hes prolly everything i need and want and im not going to give him the chance he deserves and lose him in the process....  yah, thats drama for another time and another day...
So here it is, im a blogger. Whoa, does that make me cool? Or simply a larger geek? Dunno. Maybe i'll be cool in a more ironic way... like how trucker hats were geeky, then cool, now are worn for sheer irony. [ and yes, i DO own a few trucker hats]  The reason for the blog? Ummm.....  1. Cuz im unemployed and really really bored.   2. Ive been reading a lot of blogs lately, from my friends and, strangely, from people in 24/7 DS relationships and think they are cool. and  3. Im looking for attention.     The name of the blog represents where i live and, quite amusingly, the place where I stare a lot of the time...especially when stoned.  Oh, and if any of my posse should come across this, just ta let you know ill try and use pseudonyms where necessary.  kisses A
