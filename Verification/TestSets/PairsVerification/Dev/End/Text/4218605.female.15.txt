it 'gain. For good measure.  I suck at life.
I played around with the HTML. It's a work in progress, as I told  urlLink Ira . I changed my font color, link color, hover-effects, and what the right sidebar says in terms of Archives and Previous Posts. And the font. And I added a midi file thanks to IRA! Thanks dude. It was fun singing to it. Awesome, awesome.  Anything you see is done by me, and my knowledge. If you want help, ask me.  â™¥
Hey I'm so hip this is what I'm wearing:    Express jeans (Girls!! Wtf?)  Black Chucks.  Black track jacket with white stripes (zipped up) from Express.  Green polo from Express.   Wtf am I a scenester now? Er .. I think that's scene. No, maybe not. Okay, well, I'm fuckin' hip. And here are some pics of me. They're kind of old but whatever, crackas. Get over it.     Yo wattup.     Bob &amp; I. I look fucktarded and Bob looks Mexican .. what? Ahahahaha. Okay.  I think I should put in my contacts or something. And I'M LISTENING TO THE TRIO. HOW COOL AM I?
How amazing does it feel in Nashville? PRETTY DAMN GOOD, I'LL TELL YA THAT.  Anyway, the HTML for this is seriously pissing me off. When I preview the layout, the sidebar colors are custom. I publish, and nothing's there. ;x Gah. Anyway.  This looks like a richtext mode. I do believe it's HTML compatible, though.  Rofl .. Ira. Remember back in the "old days?" Your Blogger was nospoonsdammit.blogspot.com  Man, that was old sk00l. No spoons. I don't remember how in the world we came up with that but .. it was definately an inside joke. It was when we were going out, I think. I dunno, our relationship, friend and more, was way fucked up.  Moving on.  It's Friday. Last Friday of freedom, holy shit. Just a year ago, things were fuckin'  perfect  with Bob and I. His parents liked me, and had me over for dinner all the time. Now, if I go anywhere near the house, they flame me. Fo' serious. But .. whatever. Shit happens.  Too bad she was killing me.   I'm supposed to be walking to his house today. Well, not his house because his stepdad's parents are there but. We're supposed to be walking around the White Bridge area. Maybe catch some lunch at Wendy's, I dunno. Too bad Alex is grounded from the car until Monday. I guess he deserves it. Despite that being true, I still need him as a chauffeur.  My strawberries have no flavor. That being said, I'm off to get some chips.  &hearts;   HAPPY FRIDAY THE 13TH.  Hahahahaha. Shit. I hope I don't get run over by a car in the process of walking to Bob's.
I used to use Blogger like a bitch. Now it's  urlLink LiveJournal  that rocks the house. Click the link to access it. But limited! It's Friends Only.  I'm digging Blogger's new templates. I will definately have to play with the HTML and make it rock.  Word. I'm Zoe, and I'm o
