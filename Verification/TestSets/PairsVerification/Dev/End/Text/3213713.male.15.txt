I just gave it back to him and told him to come to me when the net is on :@  At bout 3, the cable was working. I chatted with some friends. Then, Ahsan called and confirmed our plan of goin to KFC in the evening. I invited a few other friends to tag along too, but no one was willing to commit on such short notice. If only Ahsan had confirmed the plan earlier... Neways, I chatted till bout 5. Then, I changed and a guy from the office dropped me of at KFC. I was expecting Raamish to be there, but he wasnt! I had to wait for but 20 min b4 he came. Although Ahsan was still not there, we decide to dig in bcz we were damn hungry. Afterall, we hadnt had somethin since morning!! Ahsan came after another 20 min. To kill time, I decided to ask Raamish bout Ahsan's friend Anum. I didnt know that he knew nothing bout her... lol. Since he knew nothing, I decided to tell him something. Well, when Ahsan came, Raamish immediately barking out wat i had told him. Silly guy. Neways, that started the shugal we all wanted. I teased Ahsan bout Anum. He has literally blushing!! Then, a crazy thing happened. I go to Lawrewnce Garden every evening for jogging. And a friend, Hamza, goes with me. lol. What happened is that, I Ahsan told me not to invite Hamza. But i forgot to tell him that I was goin and I wont be home. At bout 6, he came to my house. My mom told him that I was at KFC. lol. He came straight to KFC. Hahahahahah!!! That was a sight!! He was infuriated. It had completely slipped my mind. Neways, after cooling him down, he began eating with us. Only 30 min were left in the all-you-can-eat deal, so he quickly dug in. Then, the fun started. Hamza already knew bout the Ahsan-Anum chakar. Raamish didnt. The two of us teased Ahsan so much that he was literally begging us to stop! Hahahahah... we had so much fun!! By 7, we were so full with chicken, that we were couldnt even get up from our seats!!  After KFC, I came back home with Hamza. We listened to some songs. While I was chatting with a friend, Ahsan came online. He was very angry with me. He was cursing me for telling Raamish bout his chakar. Lol. I managed to cool him down. Then, Hamza left. I went to the forum, posted a little, and now, since the past 30 min, ive been writing my first serious blogging post ever!:D  Now, im calling Ahsan, to tease him a little more. Then, i'll have a bath. Watch some TV. Then play some Underground. Hopefully, I'll try to incorporate the changes the client told me to do in the Clinic Managment Software I made and then ill probably sit online and chat till late.  That sums up my day, and ive finally made my first blogging post!! :
