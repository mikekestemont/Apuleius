and now the hunt is on for the Latin class assignment book. We can find everything else but that one book! So of course, everyone tries to drag me in on the hunt for the missing Latin book.   Sorry, no dice. I have had it at this point. I am trying to read e-mail, get food in my stomach, get a shower and write a blog. No, other than the food these are not "important" things really, but they are important to me and if I can't do some of the  things that are important to me I resent the people around me who deny me that ability and I am a really surly bitch. Yes, the yelling has already begun and the 11 year-old acts like a typical teenager in training with the pouting, slamming doors, going to her room and sulking.   So at the moment, the other adult just tried to look through the shit heap that is the 11 year-old's desk. She wouldn't let him saying "It's my desk" (insert whiny voice) and he simply gave up. So the Latin book is still missing and no one is looking for it. I know, that in the end, I'll look for the book. But I will do it on my time, not on someone else's. I will not let a child dictate to me how my life will run to me no matter how hard she tries.

I also know that some people will say, "Someday when your daughter is gone you will miss her and wish for even a morning like this one". NOPE. Not buying it. I don't miss her being a baby; never have. I still remember getting up multiple time per night and dirty diapers and all the stuff that comes along with babies. Don't miss it one little bit! I can tell you that I will not miss a morning like this.   But then I will also not miss the wonderful times my daughter and I have riding our horses together either or the times we have long talks and enjoy each other's company. The reason I won't miss those things is because our relationship will have evolved into something new and there will be other wonderful moments to take the place of the ones that have passed.  Stress sucks. But nostalgia is o
