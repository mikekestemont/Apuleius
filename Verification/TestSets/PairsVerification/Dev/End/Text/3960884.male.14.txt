"tuition" God, why does she even care. Its my studies, not hers. I'll do what I want with my life, thank you very much. They so want me to take additional math next year. Fuck it lah. Math is a stupid fuckin subject. Math can go to hell. As if math will help with guitar practicing. Yeah all those fuckers say that music has got to do alot with math and all that bullshit. SO WHAT? I just wanna forget my studies for a while. God why must it be so freaking impt. First thing ppl ask you..... hows your studies. studies studies studies. When am I gonna get to do the more important things in life?  My parents suck. They only let me go out ONCE a FREAKING MONTH! God, what kind of folks are that. Most people my age can go out anytime. Fuck it.      Yeah theres alot. I need time management. I need to squeeze in studies, soccer, kimberley, skateboarding, guitaring, sleeping, wasting time, computering, ahhah... um... and other things... All into one week. Fuck man. I need to manage time properly. What am I even doing on the comp?  You know the more my parents nag me to study, the more I DONT want to study. When I actually feel like studying, I will. Seriously.  I REALLY REALLY hope that I can go out for a few times this holidays.. friday, sat, sun, mon, tues. Fuck.  Yay i sweet talked my mom. I got an increase in allowance by a dollar a day! hahahahah. Pathetic.
The whole dammit world knows that I and Kim are together man. Hahahahah. But I dont really care.           I think that Kim's one totally cool person. Shes so open, unlike me. I mean shes like anything also can man. hahaha. Shes cool with anything. I can just imagine what a cool skater chic she would make........     Well today in catechism I sat with her and we talk talk lah... Power. Must spend more time with her lah. Man I cant stop thinking about kim. Must focus. Argh.          This week went by so fast. It was so uneventfull. Before I knew it, it was saturday. And then I woke up the next morning, and I went to church and spent half my day there. Now im at home with nothing to do.. typety typety type.          Slipknot rocks.          Ive got to improve my skating. Im an asshole.
