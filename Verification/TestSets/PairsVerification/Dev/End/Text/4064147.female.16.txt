about our conversation last night.   [very giddy right now about all of that]  and lets see.. I called my dad-he was at my mum's work, and asked him if he would bring me home some Chinese Takeout... and HE DID. of course. AND IT WAS FUCKING EXCELLENT! I love. Which, I think I'm about to go and have some more of it, because it sounds super-urb! I just got out of the bath tub... Shaving my legs. London had to sit in there with me though-she won't leave me alone. So she was sitting on the side of the tub, her wild tail going crazy, and as I'm lathering my leg with soap, she puts her paw on my knee--stopping my path of shaving. As a patch of soap is gone, wiped away by the razor, her little nose pressed against my newly smooth skin, and began to lick away.. After a while of her curiosity about what I was doing, she got down, and curled up in my soon-to-be-used towel, and began giving herself a bath...with her tongue.  hmph. Right now, she's curled in my bed, letting the rays of the sun put her to sleep. Cats...are weird creatures. OH AND STEVEN! that damn spider..yeah I didn't kill it last night... AND IT WAS A FUCKING JUMPING SPIDER! Because I found it again today... and tried to kill it numerous times.. but it kept jumping.. FINALLY I SMASHED THE BITCH! yaaaay!  Anyhow, Iggy is chatting away to me, shaaooo... Imma gonna go chat him up!  Love!
Wow... Blogger is so confusing the shit out of me. Em... Okay I'm new at this! Virgin! *s i g h* Let us see...I made an entry-my first, last night... But...I don't know how to get to it? I also changed my template? but whateva. This is fucking strange... We shall see what happens. if not, Erin will go back to a Blurty. hmph. So I'm going to publish this shite, just to experiment. Don't mind me...  xxx
I am not in pleasant moods currently.  I have been trying to change my profile for my Blogger, but, it isn't showing what my books are that I enjoy. It shows everything else, EXCEPT that---and that's all I really want shown. I even took away my Interests, and my Music. But no... No Erin.  My favourite books, smell like paper. I love the smell of words, I could go to the book store and sit for hours smelling the books. I'm addicted. Nerd?  yes.  Tonight, Steven called me. He did! We got to talk on the phone for roughly THREE HOURS! It was so great! That Irish accent of his---melts me. Takes away anything bad in my day, and makes it perfect. I even forgot that I was annoyed with Blogger just now. *s i g h*   Love is amazing...   I'm in a dreamy state right now...I can't really focus on this, [my first], entry. Replaying over and over the conversation that I had just two hours ago... life is sweet.    Goodnight world. I am so in l
