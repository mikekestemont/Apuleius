much to blog. Just feel bored, that's all.. My darling is getting more grumpy each day. Sigh, and I'm getting more sensitive lately. Sometimes things just go intolerable and to remain silent is the key to calmness. Couples often argue about silly things, situation gets wilder and women can't do much but to shed tears. I don't understand about relationships, I don't know why it has to be so complicated. In the ancient history, to mate is to multiply. Descendants never dies or be wiped away. But now, to date is to found the right one, and feelings get in the way. Why does generation change its forte in time? Does love exist during period of BC? Do they go through breakups? Is there such thing as what they called rebound? I wished love was much more simple than that..
Boss came up to me, all those nags bla bleh blah, nothing but more works. Weekends are not working days! God damnit! I hope she'd just retire, she's too naggy all the time and there's this team building event June 18, well she's pestering me already. Sigh.. pls let me sleep on it.
I do not know why ppl enjoy working so much here. Everybody seems to be so motivated and energized, unlike me.
I feel extremely useless at work. I need to quit. But where would I be getting cash from? *Ponders*
Ahh.. finally I get to shape my eyebrow today. Used to be bushy, but now clean and beautiful like those models u see on tv! LoL but had to spend couple of hundreds for the cosmetic items, wat the heck, I need to look good for me, for my family and for my love especially. Been eating a lot today. Pizza, bbq steamboat, wow can't imagine how much weight I have put on but I'll make up to it.  Today is significant to me. Feeling glad I'm not alone, do shopping with my beloved, checking out cool things. Ain't those what I wished for all these while?
LOL.. silly me ! I think last nite was the fun night ever! I get to meet up with DC, and my honey has got to spend time at his DYP game. He's the champion! Can you believe that? Everything turned out fine last nite, and I'm kinda happy my DC was in the mood for game too. And it's not that bad after all. I love hanging around with my honey bunny so much I think I kinda like to foos as well. Bravo, child!
Nothing much has been going around except that I am going through a change. My boss couldn't get any happier than to load me into more and more works. I don't think I could last any longer.. Anyways, too much into that, I'm leaving home for KL later. My hon's birthday. He doesn't know what I have got him. Something he glances at each time he passes it by, something he's been longing for, something he always praises but could not possess it.. that something is in my hand now. ;
