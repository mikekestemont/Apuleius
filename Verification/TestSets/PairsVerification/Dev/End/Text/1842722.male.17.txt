pizza around 5:30 and consumed ALL of it (not hard when you have 16 hungry boys there)... and also consumed ALL of tim's soda (3 12 packs I think).  I would be much amiss if I neglected to mention the playing of a surprise 1337 gamer. Aaron (also known ingame as AFLO and Lil Jon) was certainly good enough to gain the "Legendary" skill ranking I think and even gave me and my bro a run for our money a few times. I'd actually known him through the BG (not blood gulch you g33ks...) youth group, so it was cool to run into him again. Also impressive was Carter's playing skills after having only owned an xbox and halo for about 2 weeks. He must just be another natural. *grin*  As for my own playing, I'd say that I played about normal about during the middle of the day and got better as I went (meanwhile everyone else seemed to be playing better than I'm used to). As a result, I didn't do well during the start but sorta picked up towards the end. During the huge CTF games one  might  say that I was the MVP for my team, simply because whenever I left it went downhill almost immediately (really, just ask). For the FFA and TS I think Antilles (my bro) really shined the brightest. He cleaned up for the whole beginning of the day and pretty much kept up the momentum throughout the day. Tbone (though much ridiculed throughout the day, sorry tim!) I think also really shined brighter than ussual. He beat me quite a few times and I don't think unfairly, so perhaps he is finally moving himself out of the "3rd place" position.  In regard to the MVP of the entire day I'd hope that everyone will agree when I award it to my brother. I honestly think he played the best of all of us, even if he slowed down a tad at the end.  Here's the end player list for who was there:  Daniel Ben C Ben M Ben A Ben P Tim Nolan Weilin Paul Than Aaron Dad Peter Carter Mark Jordan Jesse  You'll note that there we 17 names on that list, though we never did have more than 16 (than left and peter showed up). I would personally like to give a special thanks to everyone who brought equipment and helped chip in for the pizza.  Stats: Most kills - Rendar - 138 frags in a targetted killing game Most deaths - Don't remember this one... though it was definitely over 100 MVP - Antilles Most surprising player - AFLO Most improved player - NCM (he's been promoted to the heroic rating by the way...)  I can't think of anything else, so... adios.
I believe we can add yet another player to that list - Paul.  Isn't a regular Halo player, but the more the merrier.  Might be able to get another friend.  [danielreid update] and another... Peter looks like he's gonna show up later in the day afterall, w00t [
