weddings (yeah, I know, strange for a girl) but this one was so neat. Jewels looked so perfect- and she did so much work on the church and everything... I was super excited for her. She's been through so much in life, and it looks like she's marrying into a terrific family. (I loved watching the interaction between Brett and his siblings- his face broke into a smile on seeing each one of them walk down the isle, and he had something small to say to each one as they reached by the altar.) Yeah, jewels!  Ok, anyway, I'm not writing simply to ooh and ahh over a beautiful wedding. I am rather, wanting to contemplate the concept of dancing at a wedding. Yes, I know, deep and philosophical, but really... many of the folks at my church and in the circles that run around my church are vey anit-dancing, and epecially social dancing. I guess I don't really understand the problem behind it all. I mean, yes, there are dances that I do not agree with (unless they're between married couples) but really, dancing, I think, can be truly positive. 1) Dancing (especially some of the silly dances we started out with) gives an opportunity to break the ice, and get people interacting with one another that might not otherwise know where to start. At a wedding, that means the diff between people enjoying themselves and and sitting around a table going "Yep.. we're at a wedding... yep... we're eating food, yep..." 2) Dancing, at a wedding at least, allows interaction between the guests of honor and the rest of the party. Instead of dwelling on how quickly they could get out of there( yes I KNOW how important that is for them), Jewels and Brett were chatting and having fun with their guests- it made the day more special and memorable for everyone. 3) There was dancing in Biblical times- the tradition of Jewish dancing goes all the way back (at least) to the Israelites crossing of the Red Sea (check out Exodus 15). David is known for dancing with nothing but his "linen ephod" on (see 2 Samuel 6:14) 3) Our taboo on dancing is more of a cultural than biblical thing. Most cultures view dancing as a matter of course- yes there are ways to let dancing get out of control, but really, I'm not sure it has to be. 4)Dude- it's exercise! How many Americans could use a LOT more of that??!! Alright I'm done on my soap box :)
Well, I've been meaning to set up a blog for sometime now...I'll randomly get the urge to write something down and share the world, but then I've never found one I really liked before. I visited a guy's site here ( http://transplantedtexan.blogspot.com/ ) , and decided I liked it. So, here goes!  This blog will probably be probably mostly scattered thoughts on my part (as indicated by the title!) and perhaps (if I ever figure out how) I'll let others join in on it as well :
