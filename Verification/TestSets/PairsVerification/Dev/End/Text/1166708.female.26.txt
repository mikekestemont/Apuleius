for this post here)   I thought today I wouldn't put a title cause I really can't come up with one at the moment, maybe later if I think of one I will post it.  Anyway, it's friday and that means it's the weekend and that means that I have time off from school and it's workload to have some fun.  I seem to be having a hard time thinking of something to do.  This weekend here in the city there is the  urlLink  Molson Indy  , some street party or festival on Yonge Street, and the usual parties at various clubs in the city.  All three things are of no interest to me, well except maybe the street party thing.  But you see Yonge Street is a really really long street  urlLink  (the longest in the world actually)   and I just wouldn't know what part of the street would be having the better party, know what I mean?  So I think I will opt for some needless shopping on Saturday, followed by a BBQ in my backyard, followed by cruising the nearby streets and honking at people going to the Yonge Street Party, then crashing on the couch at about 4am, wake-up on Sunday, get some breakfast and then go down to the Beaches.  Yes I think that it what I will do.  Happy Friday everyone and have a good weekend!
Summer lovin' had me a blast....    Well I am back, it is 10:50pm and I just walked into the house about an hour ago.  My weekend was really fun and relaxing.  My days as I mentioned before were spent lounging on the beach getting a tan, swimming and playing beach volleyball.  The evenings were spent making BBQ, sitting under the stars around a bonfire and sharing stories from when we were 19 years old.  It was a blast and it was a great getaway that I think we will be doing at the end of the month again.  I really needed this time away from the city and the hectic life that is Toronto living and to do some thinking about the next few steps I need to take to make this future of mine a little bit better and a lot more interesting.  I also realize that today is 4th of July so a Happy Independence Day to all my American friends!!!!!!!!
God damn wireless internet!   So much for no communication with the outside world.....someone brought a laptop with wireless internet and all I brought was a floating double bed for the water....silly me I thought we were going to the beach and all I needed to bring was some tanning oil, beach towels, a bikini, and the lovely water bed that everyone loves and is using in the water to get a better tan!  But of course I decided to take full advantage of his wireless internet and post and comment on your blogs.....good times good times....my cell phone is still off, that's a good sign....  till I post again...Happy 4th of July to all my American friends this w
