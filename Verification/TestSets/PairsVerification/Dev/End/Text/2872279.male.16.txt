internet wireless! The 2 books were then journaled and Tim posted his comments on the 2 books at the Bookcrossing site.  We then went about discussing about the sites on the internet that we frequently visit (if you're reading this right now Viewtru, we laughed out loud at the pic in your blog... XD) and checked our e-mail... =)  It went on until 5:15pm when Mom called me that it's time to go... =) I got up, shook hands and left the cafe. That ended the first meetup in Penang!
I know that there's so many things to do, so many novels to read, so many games to play, so many things to blog, so many blogs to read and so many forums to participate. The internet is an abyss full of interesting and entertainting writing. Problem is that there's not enough time in a day. And to make things worse, my school's exams start in exactly a week and I'm feel that I'm not that prepared enough for it. Sigh...  Blogging and almost everything else takes a back seat until the exams end and as you can see...  Lastly, I'll leave you with this pic, which screams out what I'm thinking at the moment...

Did a bit of googling this morning and found a copy of the Malaysian Idol -  Visitor Pass  ad from  urlLink this  thread at the MyPDACafe forums. =)  And to avoid stealing their bandwidth, I've also saved a copy of the clip (in WMV format) and uploaded it onto my website! So without further ado,  urlLink here's  the clip!
According to the  urlLink Oddly Enough  section at Yahoo! News...  * More and more Finnish conscripts are being dismissed from the armed forces due to  urlLink internet addiction ! It states that they're not fit for duty because they can't adjust to army routine.  Are they just plain weak or is internet addiction a big problem? I'd prefer to go with the latter, as I've been there before and gotten back. Internet addiction did really screw up my life at that time.  Makes me wonder if I could use that as an excuse for putting off national service in 3 years time... =P  * I never thought there would be another case of  urlLink postmen slacking , but it did happen again! Another postman working for Pos Malaysia had kept 21,000 letters, which also included magazines, bills, bank statements in his room with some being kept as long for 4 years!  Guinness World Records, anyone?  * The owners of an Amazon orange-winged parrot have booked themselves into a clinic to  urlLink quit smoking  after their vet told them that it was the only way to save him...  That's so noble of them... Awww...  =)  Btw, been busy lately, exams coming, blogging infrequently. =(  Check LJ tomorrow for more yakking... XD          31.25 %            My weblog owns 31.25 % of me.  urlLink Does your weblog own you?    Got it from Lucia's  urlLink blog !
