so it can't be that. &lt;BR&gt; is not a block level elemt, it's a text level element, so it's definetly not that.    That leaves us with &lt;blockquote&gt;and &lt;p&gt;. I decided to go for &lt;p&gt;, as this puzzled me. How can a tag be an empty tag AND a container tag  at the same time !  Well, &lt;p&gt;was the right answer and I know why. In HTML 4.01 transitional, you don't have to close the &lt;p&gt;tag, the browsers these days forgive you! But it's bad coding practice and a profesional company like CIW ( urlLink http://www.ciwcertified.com ) and teaching you this! That bloody outrageous! No wonder there are so many sites out there that don't work, or have crappy designs. People need to learn some web standards!!  OI, CIW, if you are reading this, visit  urlLink http://www.w3.org  and  learn something!   Chris... [/rant]  Don't worry, I'll be fine... Feel free to talk to me on MSN if I'm not busy.... :)
Sorry 'bout the title, just couldn't think of anything...  OMG, at my CIW course, they teach you to use table's for layout...disgusting!! lol  Also the way they write their code is awful...anyway, it's lateish and I don't want to go into that now.  Hmmm, what can I say, nothing special happened this week.  Doom 3 comes out on 3 days, I will buy my special edition then.  I'm also working on a new layout for the Dark Rose site ( urlLink http://www.darkroseweb.tk ). It's not up yet, as I am still working on it, and I want to make sure it looks half decent and it works right before I put it up.  Someone from The Wastelands ( urlLink http://www.thewastelands.2ya.com ) has suggested that I make a Counter-Strike template, so I will. Probably not tonight, or tommorow. Maybe the day after.  I'm a lil hungry now, so I'll go get some food...or starve to death while I play computer games :P :D
Bored... lol I'm at UKIT  The instructor just put a link for a games site up lol. She's cool, they would never do that at school :P  I'm doing the HTML thing today, so it's all too easy. Now I have to go... Bye :)
As you know I've started my CIW course... I started the Networking fundamentals part...it's hard, it's a hell of a lot of information to take in!! But this is the hardest part, when I get to the actual web design part, then it's gonna be easy.  Hmm, I also learned that my grandad died recently.... on either Thursday/Friday... Why am I only hearing about it now? Well, he was cremated yesterday. My dad wanted to go to his funeral (it was his dad), but he couldn't, because we ahven't got the money, the house isn't sold yet. Also the money was also spent on my CIW course... So, I'm gonna make sure that money will be put to good use, and pass this course and get this qualification.  Hmm, I'm really bored and tired right now, the course is really tiring. That's all I'm gonna say for n
