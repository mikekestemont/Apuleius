mom is helping of course..so...woo! lol Thursday I wanna hang out w/ Carly before she leaves...hope it all works out. Cuz I'm gonna miss her while she's gone. :'( Everybody's leaving me this week. For real. I'm supposed to be leaving next weekend, but I think I'm staying. I guess something exciting is supposed to happen (RIGHT Carly! :P) But Carly will be back then & so will Megan so it's got to rock somehow. :) We've got to get our group back together: Carly, Josh, Megan, and me. :) I miss 'em all. We're kind of like...family...but not. haha It's crappy weather outside right now. Kinda. I hope it doesn't rain this week, especially on my birthday. My birthdays have always sucked, so I want this one to rock. Ugh...and I have to get a job soon...haha...Crazy. Not that I mind. Sort of. Anyhoo ~ I'm off.... *All of it* -- SiLaS
So today was an interesting day, to say the least. Actually, it was boring, but...I'll say it was interesting so I won't be boring. I burned my finger today :( I was trying to cook. HaHa. Loser me :) Why are people so strange? Snuggles knows what I'm talking about :P lmao... I love havin' my Snuggles around. :) Last night I went out to eat with my mom, nephew, sister, her fiance and her fiance's dad. It was so weird. Just out of the blue at 7 o'clock at night, my sister called from her cell @ my house & asked my mom and I to meet them in town to eat. So we met them in town & went in to eat and everything. My sister and her fiance fight all the time. It's so annoying. They're both gonna be 20 soon and they act my age. I'm only gonna be 16...but I swear my sister's age and mine need to be switched. They argue for NO reason. Seriously. No reason at all. Everything's going fine then all of the sudden: boom, they start arguing. Why do people have to argue just because they're with someone? I don't mind going out with people...but I couldn't get that jealous about someone. If you're gonna be with someone you've got to have trust..or what have ya got? Exactly...not shit. Sometimes I feel like I've got this huge understanding in life...but just as I get that feeling it goes away. Someone proves me wrong. But it's cool. :) I'm fine..no complaints or whatever. So, tonight I'm hangin out w/ my favorite peeps...that'll be great as always. :) Friday nights are THE night. Oh, six days until my birthday! Woo! Big deal. lol...:D Birthday's are birthdays. After a while you get tired of them. I think I'm the one who makes a big deal out of it..and every year there's a disappointment. lol...This year's gonna be cool, though. It is. I know it is. If I want it to be cool, it's gonna be. Okay, anyway....I'm off to get ready so I can go with Carly. I'll write more later. ~
