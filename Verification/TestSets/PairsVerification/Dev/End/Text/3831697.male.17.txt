just money and talent. If the Lakers need a guy in order to get past a wall, most of the time they get it. The Clippers may add that piece, but they'll get rid of everyone else. I think Kobe was using the Clippers as more of a bargaining piece than anything else. You know, just to make sure a couple things got done back in El Segundo.    So now this whole mess involving the trades and such is pretty much done, the Laker roster is starting to shape up. I'll tell you what, they won't be as good as last year, but  athletically  this team is stellar. They still need a center, but that is attainable. Remember the change in Erick Dampier last season? He averaged twelve points and twelve boards last season for the worst team in the state of California, the Golden State Warriors. He would be a helluva pick-up for the Purple and Gold, but he'll be incredibly overpriced (especially after fellow Warrior, Adonal Foyle, got the big payday a while back). Either way, he's the best center available right now, and you have to go after him.    I also wouldn't be surprised if LA made some sort of deal to try to get Nene from Denver. At first sound, it seems highly unlikely. Think about it though. Denver just got Kenyon Martin (highway robbery for him too, or well, turnpike robbery) from the Nets. They also re-signed Marcus Camby, which will relegate "Baby" to the bench. Also, look at the depth of the Lakers now. You're telling me they couldn't try to entice that from Denver?    In the end, I think Odom could be a great sidekick to the Kob-ster. Batman's Robin, Jordan's Pippen, Tiger's weird talking club cover. Odom could really be a great player if he keeps himself healthy and out of trouble. I also think Caron Butler is a stud. He was the most overlooked rookie two years ago. Last year, he dealt with injuries and the shine of fellow overlooked rookie (regular season-wise at least) Dwyane Wade. He may be a bench guy now, but he is no slouch whatsoever.    I don't think that this team is as bad as everyone is saying they are. This team can go places if they can stay healthy and have some resemblence of chemistry. But, I am a Laker fan, and one definitely needs to have some optimism after losing the most dominating force ever to play in the League.    Until Later Posts,    Clay Trainum
I'm pretty bored at the moment, so I decided to do something I've been meaning to do for a while, publish a blog. I know, I know the fad has been around for quite a while now. I figure who better to bring up the caboose than the Trainwreck? (Ed. Note: You like that? Off the top of my head too. What can I say? Genius, pure genius...) Anyway, I'll probably start posting my useless, boring, slanted sports views on here in the coming days. See you guys around, I g
