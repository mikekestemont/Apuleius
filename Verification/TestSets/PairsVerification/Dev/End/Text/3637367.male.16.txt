this one, final competition. Years of struggle, pain, sweat, and tears have brought you here, and now it is time to test the fruits of your labour against those of your opponents for the chance to win gold. What if right before the race you found out your opponents were toddlers? Surely you could win easily, but even if you did, would you feel as if you had accomplished something?  It is through struggling in a battle against our obstacles that we find meaning in our life. 	By overcoming obstacles in life, we attain dignity.  As humans, we could never have dignity if everything in life was handed to us on a silver platter. Dignity is essential for human happiness, and without a sense of integrity a person cannot have dignity. By sticking to our guns when a situation turns unfavourable, and persevering, we remain true to ourselves. Respect is essential for dignity, and someone who has no conflicts in life to overcome is not respected. Think about it, would you respect someone who had everything given to them in life? Of course not. In fact, you might think that person was spoiled. Despite what we think, by not always having life go the way we want it, we achieve dignity. It is through struggle, not relaxation that we come to discover just who we are. Adversity is what defines us humans, and it is through struggle that we come to know who we are. 	Adversity is the fulcrum of life. It is through the hardships in life, that we find true happiness and fulfilment in life. If life were perfect, and flawless, our personalities would be like a blank painterâ€™s canvas. Perseverance is the colour of life that fills the canvas of our character, and makes our life more then a bland bleary painting. As humans, we can choose to take the road of least resistance, or we can actually live our lives by rising to each new challenge that is thrown at us. In life, we can either choose the former path and be robots, or we can take the latter route, and be truly human. The question is: what do you want to be?
Well, the idea for this blog started after I had already finished the first book in A Song of Ice and Fire, A Game of Thrones. I am now reading A Clash of Kings.  A Game of Thrones was an interesting and very entertaining read. I've become hooked on Martin's form of writing and the story he has created. It is amazing; the good guys do not always win, there is much violence, and it is an epic.  It was crazy what happened to Eddard Stark, I knew it was going to come because of Martin's reputation but it was still surprising, he was an extremely important character. I also like Jon quite a bit. I have a feeling that he is actually the son of Rhaegar and Lyanna and will somehow hook up with Dany to rule the world. :p  More to come l
