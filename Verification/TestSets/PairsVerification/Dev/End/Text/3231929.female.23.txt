a while where I haven’t had to fight myself to stay awake in lectures. Don’t know why that was.  Had a practical skills session this afternoon too, it was good apart from a useless SHO trying to teach us about developmental milestones. I object to being murmured at.  The weather was quite sticky today. Luckily this afternoon there were some brief rumbles of thunder and a few drops of rain to dissipate the mugginess.  I had Ann on the phone this evening, she was concerned about Mum. In the room Mum stayed there was a ¾ length mirror which she had apparently turned to face the wall. Ann was concerned as this probably indicates that Mum has pretty low self esteem. It doesn’t surprise me, she has put on a lot of weight over the past year or so, but I don’t see how she thinks running from the problem is going to help. I suggested we gently suggested she add to her interests something at the leisure centre like swimming as I’m sure they must have at least one session a week of women only.  I got another edition of Runner’s World today, reminding me that I haven’t done any real exercise myself for a few months.
Sunday and no rest day for me. I woke at about 8:45am, earlier than I’d have liked for a Sunday but I had places to be. Still couldn’t organise myself very well though, was supposed to be in Stratford for 10:00am, I made it there for 10:45am.  Couldn’t help but initially feel that Ann wasn’t best impressed with my presence, not that I really cared. Mum remarked, probably for the sake of having something to say, that she’d never been to some out-of-town store or other, so needless to say, off we went. It was tacky and cheap, I’m sure Mum won’t be returning. Then much to my horror there was a B&Q next door so we wondered into that too. Why people go to these nasty stores on Sundays is beyond me, have they got nothing better to do with their time?  Lunch was supposed to be at 2:00pm, so I thought, but no being a barbeque it was eventually cooked by 3:15pm (I was hoping for an early-ish return home too!). Had a chat with my cousin Bridget, discussed Mum with Ann after she’d left at 4:00pm. Ann clearly thinks I’m doing too much for Mum, and looking at today I have to say that I won’t be going down to Stratford again simply because Mum wants me too. It seems like a case of cruel to be kind, but I can’t live her life for her. Nor can I drop everything to keep her company to allay her fears.  If only things were simple.  Got back home at about 5:30pm. Haven’t achieved anything much this evening. Had Mum on the phone twice already, neither about anything important.   Another source of irritation is that I still haven’t ventured out to do any form of exercise.  All in all, not a productive w
