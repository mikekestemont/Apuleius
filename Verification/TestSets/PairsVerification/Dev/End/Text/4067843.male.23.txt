own, getting set up in my office at school, pre-thesis talk with the advisor, buying a car (which is quite exciting) and all that entails, and just mentally getting ready to relearn fun things like dynamics and thermodynamics......  Don't become too comfortable with the lack of political banter, it will surely be back.....  The blog and the website may be on the move as I look into getting things hosted on my own server in the coming weeks....
Yes....that's right in a little over a week I'll be headed back to northern AL, where I once again have to unpack everything I own, after moving twice in two months. I have enjoyed my time here although there are many things in this city which tend to rag on me....  1. it is impossible to eat a good meal here, you'd think with all these people there would be plenty of good places to eat, well of course there are if you prefer exotic food, like afghan resturants...  2. it is fun to have machine gun wielding police officiers pacing around the train you ride everyday.....  3. maybe something only meteorologists will understand, I am become completely annoyed with DC and lack of convection....the DC hole has been in effect all summer....  I do look forward to getting back to AL and starting grad school....  I did receive some good news today, although it was expected, just maybe not this soon, but a paper I am listed as a co-author on was officially published in the Journal of Climate....the link below will take you to the abstract and if you have access to the AMS journals, an opportunity to view it....   urlLink http://ams.allenpress.com/amsonline/?request=get-abstract&issn=1520-0442&amp;volume=017&issue=15&amp;page=2983   Of course I can have a post without a political rant and today once again it is squarely aimed at our W.  well....according to the Blue Hill Report, a publication here in DC, our favorite President is currently doped up on power anti-depressents....the following quote appears in the article  "Although GOP loyalists dismissed the reports an anti-Bush propaganda, the reports were later confirmed by prominent George Washington University psychiatrist Dr. Justin Frank in his book Bush on the Couch: Inside the Mind of the President. Dr. Frank diagnosed the President as a “paranoid meglomaniac” and “untreated alcoholic” whose “lifelong streak of sadism, ranging from childhood pranks (using firecrackers to explode frogs) to insulting journalists, gloating over state executions and pumping his hand gleefully before the bombing of Baghdad” showcase Bush’s instabilities."  ....well if that doesn't scare you i don't know what does....speaking from experience any one on this type of medication should not be the commander in chief.....NO MATTER WHAT....  a link to the story is provided below....   urlLink http://www.capitolhillblue.com/artman/publish/article_4921.shtml   Well obvisously it does make a lot of sense, our foreign policy has been compared to that of a mad man and now it seems to be fact.....our President is a paranoid meglomaniac......just great.....I know i should be going back to northern AL but maybe a change of plans including an escape to Canada could be in order.......   urlLink h
