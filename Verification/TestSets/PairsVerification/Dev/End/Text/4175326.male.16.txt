all the stop signs now, just because you got me all worked up.... assholes.
Well, I'm back, you lucky bastards. I didn't do that much today, I slept in late and then sat around reading. Reread the Communist Manifesto for the millionth time, tooks some notes on it for an essay im going to write. What many people fail to realize is that there has never been a communist country. The USSR, North Korea, China, Cuba, were never communist. Communism is defined by collectivism and ownership by the public. In these countries, the resources were managed by an elite few ruling the state. This could be defined as a socialist oligarchy, but not as marxist communism. Yeah, well thats what the essay will be about. I will probaly post the essay in my blog when I am done.      Today I realized that I am very very close to being a legal adult. In about a year, I will be 18. This means alot of things, added responsbilities, financial indepedence, possiblity of being drafted, the power to vote (... well it isnt really a power, its meaningless, all you get is a decision between the evil of two lessers), a whole bunch of stuff changes. I am afraid of getting older. Not because I'm afraid to die, but because im afraid of getting sucked into the corporate machine and giving up on my goals. I do not want to become another gear, another number. I want to be original. I do not want to be tied down with work, with tradition, with obedience. I want to be free. I sincerely hope that my life does not be about the paycheck. I hope I will be strong and resist the brainwashing techniques that we are fed everyday. I know that if I want to change the world I have to start with my self. I cannot expect others to protest for me, to fight for me, to die for me. I need to be the activist, the soldier. I cannot sit back in my comfortable suburban house with my preporccessed family and boring music and wish I had done something about the world. I need to Revolutionize myself if I want to revolutionize my world. Let the spirit and fervor of the revolution be with you.
Hey, this is my first post. Not too much going on right now, i'm just finishing up an article for a local newspaper, "The Voice". It's a free paper, and it will print any article that community members send in, so i suppose it's best described as a printed public forum. The article im currently working on is about the lies spread by the authorities before a large protest and the mistreatment that activists are faced with because of the police force. It will be the first I've written for The Voice and I plan on writing alot for the paper, if they will have me. Anyways, I'm going to go and e-mail my little essay to the editor, so I'll post something new tommorrow.      Solidarity, rebels.    August S
