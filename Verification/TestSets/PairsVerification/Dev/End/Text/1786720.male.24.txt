very tired blake - out
Ahh just at the tail end of a lush weekend, for many reasons so let me explain. Firstly I am not one for hot weather, in fact I generally hate it, I don’t think that my body was designed to work in a hot climate and for the most part whenever the temperature goes over about 18 degrees I try and hide from the world in the coldest place I can find! Therefore I put my case that I should be shipped to the Antarctic (with appropriate funds and satellite hook-up not to mention broad band :).
So this aside Kat came down this weekend for a visit which was cool, and we had a great time, amazingly she managed to drag me (kicking and screaming) down to the beach as we just “had” to enjoy the lovely weather…. Oh and it was lovely about as lovely as sticking me in an oven. Anyway so we go down to the beach, it’s the first time in as long as I can remember that I’m actually wearing shorts this is a bad sign for me and anyone unlucky enough to see my legs :P
So we are down there and in all sun creamed up in factor one billion or what ever you have to wear nowadays so your skin does not boil and your innards turn into a cancerous mess, (Actually it was probably factor 25 I don’t know I’m a guy…) and the funny thing I actually enjoyed it, it was kind of relaxing once you get past the point of thinking your about to catch fire.  So looks like it was Beach 1 Blake 0. I did not get sunburnt I did not hate it, and I got to laugh at lots of stupid people getting burnt or having to deal with really annoying children ha ha ha!  Talking of annoying children, there was so many of them that it just reinforced my view of never having my own so bonus! (Anyway I am sure there is some obscure law somewhere that says I can’t procreate, something about polluting the gene pool).
Though I have to say one of the best things that happened this weekend was I GOT A DIGI CAM! YAY, no more relying on the old’s digi cam(s). Mmmm its so shiny to, and it was a mini revenge on going to the beach I got to drag Kat around electrical stores I ridiculous heat so I could decide on the one I wanted *evil grin*.
So here are the details of this momentous purchase: It’s a Sony DSC-P72 Camera, Its 3.2 Mega pixel, with a 3x Optical Zoom and (up to) 3x Digital Zoom. Also, its mine and its lush, I would write more but just go   urlLink here  and read the r
