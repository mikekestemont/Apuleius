Speed quite like Speed, fast and a high. It was rather enjoyable and had some twists that actually surprised me. The acting wasn't anything amazing, but the actual substance and constant action made up for it. I'd recommened that if you are looking for an action flick and havn't seen Speed, to check it out. BTW: I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT THE DRUG SPEED, IF YOU TAKE SPEED, DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK!. Btw (2), if you want to donate to this site you can bake me cookies and fedex em to me. Thanks in advance.         Overall Rating (4):
Plot:     NOTE: Before you read this, you may want to copy the entire review into word and run spell check because I am too lazy to do it.  Now, before you read this, I am going to apoligize. This apologe for the following not being funny. I'm sorry. Anyways, to the topic. Slackers is a movie about a trio. Yes a trio, as in three, like 2+1, or 1+1+1, or just 3. In this case I'm not sure. Anyways the three fellows are slackers. Yes, slackers, as in they don't do work at their college. However, this is not the case, they do plenty of work; just not the kind of work that the college wants. These young men spend their free time (when they arn't smoking large amounts of Mary Jane and wasting time) planning extravagent schemes to cheat their way out of taking tests. They happen to pull a little job to gain the answers for a midterm, however one the guys involved (Dave) writes down his number for a woman, however the number of left and a curious invdividual who has an obsession (I put this lightly) for the same woman takes the number which happens to be a copy of the mid term and uses it to black mail the trio into helping him get the girl.       Review:   Well, writing a review takes a lot of effort. Most people don't realize that I actually have to type this out. Most of you think I some sort of program where I just select "Good" or "Crap" from a menu and click "Go" and it automatically writes a long detailed review for the movie. This is not the case. I would have to say, this was a "Good" movie. I did not expect much, and however I found myself laughing almost as often as I was not laughing. It used a good selection of characters to bring teh funny. The plot left a little to be desired however it didn't get in the way like most comedys so, my hat is off on that detail. I believe that it would have been made better if they had expanded the movie a little, made it more detailed and used a full 2 hours rather then an hour and a half. It had potential to become a Van Wilder, but didn't quite make it. I recommened renting it and checking it out, and if you feel like it, laughing.          Overall Rating (
