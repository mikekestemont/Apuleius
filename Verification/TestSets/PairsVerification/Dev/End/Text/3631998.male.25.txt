distribute or any other thing without your consent. That is the 'Â©' next to logos and on every book you'll find on a bookstore.  But since the popularization of the internet one thing came up quickly : cooperative work. We suddenly have lots of people from around the world working on the same program/book/music. And there was the single person that made something that he wanted to be distributed thru the internet. Be it a free software or a book. With that raised the GNU license that has it's pro's and cons and normally only applies to software.   urlLink Creative Commons  created a few "copyright licenses" for normal people. That means no lawyers, nor confusions when trying to use someone's work. Each license has two versions, the easy-to-read-and-easy-to-understand one and the legal wording one. Both say the same thing one is for the average people (you and me) and the other is for the lawyers of the world that like to speak weird stuff and read 3000 lines affirming something that can be said in one line and without fuss.  So Creative Commons made the (CC), something that states: "I made this, but you can use it if you do this and that." Simple, easy and fair to all. And better yet CC covers from text to music and other stuff.  Clearly everyone that has something online should check  urlLink Creative Commons  so they can assure their rights and still allow people to use their work. Like I do.  My type of CC License, says simply that you can use anything on this blog and by use I mean : copy, distributexhibitbit, execute, create something using this as a starting point, and even use commerciallylly. But you have to give me credit for what is my work and everything you do has to have the same License. It's that simple.  Use freely but add my name to the damn thing so I get the credit I deserve.  Cool?  I know I am.
Today I updated my  urlLink Yahoo Messenger  and it came with a thing called  urlLink LAUNCHcast Radio  sure it is Yahoo pushing another of their services to their customers and shit. But since you can create your station for free and themusic quality is good, I gave it a try. And I must say this : COOL!!! &nbsp; Their casting is smooth and works well. I already have something like 2-3 Gb of MP3s at my work computer just to keep the variety going, but withbroadband internet acess and the radio I'm pretty sure my horizon of musichas just exploded. Another thing on  urlLink LAUNCHcast  is that you can rate almost everything, from genre to artist, albums and song. With that in place they'll keep playing the stuff you like and avoid what you don't like. If they're going to sell that information, or use it to clean their buttocks I don't really care. I want a soundtrack to work with and I don't care about anadvertising here and there.So if you want to check my station  urlLink click h
