get what I mean.  Yeah, but what's messed up about today is that I weighed in at my HIGHEST WEIGHT EVER. Yep, I've never ever seen the numbers 2.9.3. on my scale until today. Just lovely.  I got a random appointment for another job interview today. In the same industry I'm trying desperately to get out of. I'll go, but I'll probably just end up recommending one of my former employees. You know, I guess I should count my blessings with this whole job interview thing. I mean, I may be large, but I'm not a slob. And I live in the deep south, where there's a lot of fattys. People don't look at me and say, "She's fat." They look at me and say, "She's fatter than me." Southerners eat more than any single group of people on earth, I'm sure of it.  It could be worse... I could live in L.A. or New York or Miami, land of the Beautiful People. I would never even get an interview there. I went to Miami last month before my vacation to the Bahamas. I was astounded at how many Beautiful People live there! They're all tan and thin or muscular and model-like. I could have spent my entire vacation there just staring at people. I went to South Beach and I felt like a whale in a fish bowl. It was still fun, though.  Sometimes though, the Beautiful People seem confused to me. I saw this one promotional girl, she was naturally gorgeous, but she was wearing leopard print pants that showed the crack of her ass, a halter top and so much makeup you could have raked it off with a serving spoon. Why do the BPs do this? There are times when I see a pretty woman wearing an outrageous outfit, like a catsuit or a miniskirt, and I think, "Work it girl! If you got it, flaunt it!" But for this girl, I wanted to say, "You need to fix whatever part of your mind that told you that outfit looked good."  Anyway, I now understand why Will Smith had to write a song about Miami. I look forward to going back there!
Weight: 292, 290, 291  Food: 3 oz. ham Collard greens Rice Black Beans Fresh corn Kool-aid (Sunday Dinner at my sister's)  I actually did very well on food today - I just had one spoonful of each, I didn't overeat anything, and that's difficult for "soul food" meals. I wanted to start August off right.  If you're wondering about the weigh-in, I put all those numbers up there because occasionally my scale does that. I weighed once, then again, then again, and all three of those numbers came up. I didn't want to choose one, so I chose all 3. I think that just sort of happens when you're this large. My scale is confused... "Heavy load! Tell her anything, just get her the heck off me!"  Anyway, as I lose weight that will happen less and less. And yes, I do plan to lose w
