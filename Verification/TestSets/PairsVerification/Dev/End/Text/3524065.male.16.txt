just won't come out  i want to die  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; free myself from all this doubt  i want to feel  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; something new and something different  i want to be  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; someone else and less malignant  &nbsp;  i'd sell my soul  [or my body or my blood]  to spend eternity with you  and get myself through all this mud.  i only feel right  when i'm by your side  but it hurts when you're gone  when will this pain subside?  &nbsp;  i feel sick - i feel sad  i'm so stupid - i feel mad  my mouth is watering  salivating - overflowing  like before you throw up  spill your guts - chuck it up  my stomach hurts so very much  i want to vomit - i want to die  i want to feel something other than this  i need to escape - i need to fly  &nbsp;  where have you gone?  you've left me here alone  i miss you so much  now that i'm on my own  &nbsp;  one night i will cry  and then the pain might die  i need you by my side  happiness - i am denied.  next to you i will stand  and i will kiss you: so grand  but will our love withstand  my paranoid mind/or my worrying thoughts  i am distraught.
We talked for a while   We hugged and cuddled a lot   You pecked my cheek when you left   I pecked your's back   But I spent the whole time   In the back row of that dark room   Looking at you   Wanting to kiss you   Wanting to show you that I love you   But I'm used to rejection   And it's scarred me.     So now you're gone And I feel so empty Like a part of me has died Only to be resurrected When you return   I try to keep myself busy But you're on my brain I call you - but no answer How long till I see you again?   I keep thinking: If anything could happen now What would I want to happen? And the answer is the same everytime I wish for a knock And for my door to open And for you to be standing there Glowing with your usual aura of beauty I long for your touch The sweet sound of your voice And the moments we spend together Curled up together Am I asking for too much?
I'm stuck in a painting I'm stuck with a beautiful view I'm stuck in a masterpiece I'm stuck here; without you  Dangling off of this cliff I get a sinking feeling I'm here alone Only a photo of you And the rocks below start to look appealing  And at the parties late at night I'm there in the corner thinking of you wanting you needing you  I need someone to cling to I'm an emotion junkie When I say that I love you You must know that it's true I can give you that guarantee  Wishing for a girl like you Hoping for a girl like you Hungry for a girl like you No Not 'like' you,  Y
