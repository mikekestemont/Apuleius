camp, guys will tend to start showering concern because they dun wan these treatment to be shown to their love ones(GF).    It is never wrong to choose the Best for oneself, but I would like to strongly urge all lovers, to FEEL more for the opposite parties. Think of wat the opp party will feel, before you do anything. Even till the last minute of your relationship, which is breaking-up, think of how they will feel when you do heartless stuff. E.g: Going into another relationship too fast, will make your ex feel that ur past relationship is quite worthless or that you may have already been cheating behind his back before the breakup. Trust me, I was a victim.    Summarising this article will be a reminder to all that : Having affair with another party after marriage is called ADULTERY(Crime?). So wat makes it right to cheat behind your lovers' back before marriage?
First day of school was cool, Econs is challenging, and I was a victim of morning bad breath.

Think I have an aim for my next 3 yrs in life, FULL CONCENTRATION in studies and get my 1st class honours. No more BGR bullshit man, Kenney's into full-time Studies and nothing more....  Yours sincerely, Kenney the Man..
Tommorow will be my first day in school yet again. Well, all 'first day in school' feels the same. As usual, I am feeling quite nervous, and quite excited. None of my friends are attending the same lecture with me tommorrow, so I think tommorrow will be a boring day. *Yawn, Had a good saturday outing with my fellow abangs. We saw a bunch of clowns outside cineleisure shouting and each other, over small matters. Jonnie boi told us that the monkeys are friends, and they are Bengs, Loser bengs who cry during their conversation. Nah haha... 'I, Robot' is not bad after all, esp : I'm allergic to Bull-shit. Great quote there by, Will Smith.       Well, let's see if 1st day in school is good experience for me this time round... And the scouting for babes will start... I'll s
