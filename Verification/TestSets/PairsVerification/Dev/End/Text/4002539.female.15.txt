It felt like a steam iron rolling out the wrinkles of a shirt that had been discarded on the floor in a heap.&nbsp; The bathroom light kept flickering.&nbsp; I didn’t need it so I turned it off, my hand reaching out of the shower like a person reaching for a dead person’s soul in one of those ghost stories.&nbsp; The alarm went off in my parent’s room, loud and forgotten. I dropped the soap bottle onto the tile and ended up slipping on it because it had spilled over, its cap broken off.&nbsp; The alarm clock kept getting louder, buzzing in my head, screaming at me…like it wanted help, wanted me to make it stop.&nbsp; I tried to get up, but I slipped again and hit my head on the garnet counter, the sharp edge cut into my skin and I fell into a sleep.&nbsp; (Boyfriend, this is the beginning, she sees this, but happens 3 years later.&nbsp; Something I have to do with that number…)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~Come here, now you brat!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~I don’t want to.&nbsp; I’m not going ANYWHERE NEAR YOU!!!
