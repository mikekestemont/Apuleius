the thing about them being fuzzy right before they break up - the official word on the report is "much less solid appearance appearing more as an area of infiltrate."  Also, because my blood is FINALLY good this probably means the cancer is OUT of the bone marrow (which produces blood!)  On another note, I got in trouble at the chemo place.  I had met a new friend - "Velma from Truchas".  We were laughing and talking about our cancer and treatment and our kids and stuff like that.   Well, hurumpf, this grumpy old man threw down his magazine and said he couldn't stand our chatter.  Velma and I actually quit talking for a full hour out of respect for HIS cancer.  I finally had enough of that (I mean we have cancer too and we wanted to talk), so I told the nurse and she moved El Groucho over to the Grumpy Man Corner all by himself.  :o)  So Velma and I happily resumed talking, eating our cookies and crackers.  Her teenage grandkids even stopped into visit her on their way to see Ozzy Osborne in concert. :o)
Overall good news.  The tumors (in my lungs and in my abdomen) are all down in size about 1/3, but the best news is that they are no longer solid appearing, only hazey.  The doctor said they usually appear hazey right before they break up!  (This was the first anyone had mentioned about the tumors in my abdomen although it was apparently in my ct scan in May. Grrrr....)  The doctor and the report said the improvement is SIGNIFICANT!  They do not refer to my huge lung thing as a tumor.  They refer to it as "persistent abnormal mediastinal soft tissue".  It has decreased in thickness about 30 percent.  The fluid in my lungs has decreased, but there is still "fluid or thickening" around the heart.   My blood results were also good with all results (including the anemia) now within normal range.  Since the anemia was caused by the cancer, this is GREAT news!  Since I got chemo today, I am going to bed now.  :o)
I just got done reading the latest email on the Hodgkin's email list and I'm laughing so hard I think I might fall out of my chair.  Usually women post on the list and the women discuss things like "will my hair fall out", "can I still work while I'm doing chemo", "will I live or die"...you know important stuff.  But the last few days, the list has been taken over by the guys with Hodgkin's.  They are discussing how soon and how often after chemo you can have sex. I'd say some of them, no most of them, are even braggin'.  It is hilarious.
If I had to guess I'd say this chemo is working.  Yesterday, I had so much energy I could hardly stand it - I painted the deck (two gallons of paint) and cleaned two large area rugs.  This morning I made fresh banana bread (7:14 am).   I haven't had energy like this in y
