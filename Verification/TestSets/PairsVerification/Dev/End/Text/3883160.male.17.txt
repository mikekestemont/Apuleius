London. Do they want sweet revenge, or do they just want to make things MORE difficult for the remaining comidiennes? I wonder...   Anyways, I'll write more on Friday... the day after the first eviction on BB5.
Well, it turns up that I got my TV on Saturday rather than Friday.  But, hey, I have a VCR now!  So I can tape Last Comic Standing while Big Brother 5 is on.  I got "The Family Guy" series on DVD for $44.  I haven't had much time to watch it though.  LCS and BB5 are going to be on tomorrow.  Last Comic Standing airs from 7-9 c/t and Big Brother is on from 8-9 c/t for anyone interested in watching them.  There's not much to say now, but I'm sure I'll be more talkative on Wednesday... the day after I see the shows!  I just got done working.  We only had 70-some people who ate at the restaurant today, so it was really slow.  The restaurant I work at usually serves at least 100-150 people daily!  Of course, it's a Monday and Mondays can be slow sometimes.  Probably because we close at 1:00 on Mondays when we normally stay open until 2:00 on other days.  It's closed all day on Tuesday.  I usually work Mondays, Wednesdays, and Sundays.  This week, I'm working Thursday too.  Well, talk to you all later.
Hi!  My name is Dan, and I'm new at this.  Anyways, I'm a reality tv junkie (thanks, Brian).  I like to watch the  urlLink Last Comic Standing  and  urlLink Big Brother 5 .  Unfortunately, they both air on Tuesdays at the same time.  Today, my sister is taking me to Winona to get a new VCR.  Then I can tape Last Comic Standing while Big Brother's on.   Big Brother 5 :   On the premiere eppy of BB5, Jase won HoH ("Head of Household").  Jase bugs me because he and Scott believe that they're in control of everything in the Big Brother house.  Maybe that's true, but I believe someone in the house is going to win HoH and put both of them up for eviction at the same time, assuring that one of them will be evicted.  On yesterday'ss episode, Jase decided to put Mike and Jennifer (aka Nicomus) up for eviction.  I hope that Mike goes home because Nicomus rocks.  By the way, Nicomus is the half-sister of Michael.  So, I hope Michael prevents Nicomus from getting the boot.   Last Comic Standing :   vs.   Last Tuesday, Ant (left) lost the head to head match to Gary Gulman.  I'm glad of that because Ant seemed manipulative.  To tell the truth, I was shocked because I thought Ant was funnier than Gary.  However, the audience said differently.  Next Tuesday, the comics have to perform their act in front of one tough crowd... kids!  This might be tough for some comics, but I hope Tammy does fine.  Tammy is my favorite comic because she won against Todd Glass in the head-to-head match, effectively sending him home!  So, those are the two main shows I'm watching.  See y
