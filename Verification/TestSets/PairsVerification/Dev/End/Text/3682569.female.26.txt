take the higher road.      There, that's that.
No not to drugs, but to this show on HBO called  Six Feet Under , perhaps you've heard of it? The thing about it is that we don't have HBO. Dean was apart of this thing called Netflix. It was a pretty good deal. He found the first season of it on DVD, so we got hooked. The problem is that we had to wait almost a year to see the second season. Now I just finished watching the second season, and how long will I have to wait for season 3 to come out on DVD? This is what's wrong with society. We want things now, at least I do. I don't want to have to wait for anything. Instead of watching this show like a normal person, that is, one show a week throughout a season, I watched it all within a matter of a week or so. Talk about a glutton. *sigh* Anyway, it's a great show, about a family who runs a funeral home. It sounds morbid, but it's more about relationships than about actual death. Check it out, but keep in mind it's from HBO so there's sex, cursing and drugs involved.  You know I realized that all people want in this world is to be loved. It's all I want. I want to feel special and loved. I like to be liked by others. I like to make people happy. The other day I bought a homeless man a bottle water, and I felt bad I didn't get him something to eat. I felt so sorry for him. It was probably close to a 100 that day, and he looked like he could use something to eat. But I was at 7-11, and it didn't occur to me to get something other than water for him. I wonder how people let their lives get to that point. Does he have a drug or alcohol problem? Did his family throw him out? Does he have a family? What would be the one thing he would want to do over? What would be the one thing I would want to do over? I haven't lived that long, but I do have some regrets. Maybe not regrets per se, but more like missed opportunities. I know one thing that I wish I could change about myself....I wish I had more guts. I wish I had learned how to stand up for myself. I blame that on my step-father, a man who always shot me down. Maybe it's just who I am. Do I really let people walk over me, or am I just being nice? It's a fine line.  I know this is suppose to be my journal, but I think I have revealed too much. Now my soul is out there to be read by you all. Well, be nice and think nice thoughts. I actually like this whole idea of a blog. You know, some really cool people have blogs. Yup, it's true! :)  Take care dear blog, till m
