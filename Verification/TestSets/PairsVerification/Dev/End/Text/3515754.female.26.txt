an exit because we were both freaking out and didn't give JH proper directions. We finally got to the airport with about 25 minutes to spare, only to find out when we checked in that there was a direct flight leaving at 7:35. So there we were in the airport with much time to kill, still really freaked out about the whole thing.  We arrived safely, and got the rental car (we had to upgrade, because even though I requested a 4-door, they tried to give us a 2-door; and I was not about to make a pregnant woman climb into the back of a 2-door compact) and got to Argonne National Labs rather swiftly and safely. The mapquest directions we were following took us there the long way, but it wasn't even a worry at that point. We met up with SES, who we were both very excited to see, and the three of us hung out for the rest of the night, staying up until a ridiculous hour.  Next morning we woke up early to see SES off to work, then K and I went in search of the train station ( we couldn't find it) went grocery shopping, and went to the guest computer lab at Argonne. I would have posted a bit, but I didn't have my passwords with me. We met up with SES around 7 back at her place (we stayed with her since her roommates were away) and went to pick up AC at Midway. It's fortunate that Argonne and Midway are close, because there was a lot of traffic, and we only had an hour. We made it with about 20 minutes to spare. The boards were all screwed up at Midway, so we couldn't figure out whether or not her plane was on time, and after a while we had to go to the counter to check because we didn't see her and it was after 8. We finally figured out that she was waiting at the gate, because KCI is evidently an old-style airport design, with separate entrances and waiting areas for each gate, and she'd been waiting for us at her gate because she didn't know we couldn't go back there.  We had planned to go drop off our stuff, then go to a club for some dancing. Poor AC is 4 months pregnant, and she was just too tired and stressed to join us. It was a shame, because she'd gotten dressed and all before she decided to stay in, and she looked really cute. Also, once we got there it turned out that they had really nice lounge areas and she probably would have been fine to just sit and enjoy the music for a few hours. It was great music, too.  Well, I think I'm past my allotted finger pain threshold after being away for such a spell. Tomorrow (or later today as it were) I'll go into more detail about Friday night, and the rest of our trip. Right now, I'm very tired. Sleep tight L
