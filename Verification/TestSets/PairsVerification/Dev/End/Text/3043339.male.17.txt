tournaments are MAD easy for me. It's basically putting in sucker bets to get some callers, then bashing them with the nuts. If you can double up after Level 4, you're almost garunteed to place as long as you don't tilt away your chips.   The most annoying thing to me is when there are 6 people left. The bubble orbits are EXTREMELY long, and you really can't get all your chips in pre-turn or you'll never get a caller. The top 5 is basically a crapshoot. I got 5th last night because some putz played 87o after my 1200 chip raise and caught his gutshot on the river. If you bide your time in the first couple of levels, typically you'll make the final table before the first break. The first 10 people to get knocked out are always horrible, and in my experience there are usually 2 very good players, 7 good players, and 21 very bad players (one of the very good players being yourself). I try real hard not to invest too many chips into the pot preflop, because if you don't have many chips early in the tournament, you'll feel more and more dominated by the bigger stacks. Besides, why risk alot of chips just to get 45 chips worth of blinds? If you're going to steal/raise with your premiums, wait until Level 5 or 6.  I'm going to start talking about my bankroll, what I plan on doing with my bankroll, etc. in the near future. At the moment, I'm attending the Art Institute of Pittsburgh. There are alot of home games in the area, I just have to find them. I'm trying to pay for college and eat off of my poker funds. My bankroll has capped at $680, before I proceeded to tilt it away at the $100 NL tables. I am still paying to learn, but I haven't had to rebuy since I did it for the 3rd time. Right now, my bankroll is exactly at $250. I don't need much money, but I do love to spend money, so I'm thinking if I could pull down $100 a week, that's a little bit more than I could make pumping a minimum wage job here in Pittsburgh. I definitely think this goal is possible, I just need to develop some morals and standards of when to quit, etc.  Hope you enjoyed this post. It's kind of hastily written, but you'll have that I suppose. My future posts will be more structured, but I'm in class, so it definitely blows.
