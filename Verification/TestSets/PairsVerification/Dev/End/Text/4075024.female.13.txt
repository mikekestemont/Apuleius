I love kevin so much     What should i do     He probably hates my guts     But theres nothing i can do     He dosen't like to keep in touch     It feels like he just shuts me out     But i love him and never will i stop     Unless i am dead     I doubt he wil ever think about me     So i will just keep all of this unsaid     Every1 probably thinks i am nuts     But they will never under stand until they too     love someone as much as i do!!!     ~*This poem sucks but i don't care!!!*~ *Nivolker* (Ashley)     I    ♥    M-T-H-W     *&amp;*     Kevin!!!!
Hi,     You may think you know me,     but you really don't,     No1 knows me.     I am alone,     forever and always,     You will never know the real me.     I am different.     I don't say wee,     when i ride the cyclone.     I don't go down the right hallways,      I'd rather take the back way,     And stay far away from you!     So you will never know!!!     I    ♥    M-T-H-W     *&amp;*     Kevin!!!!
