As a full time Power Seller on eBay, there is definitely a slight slow down during the summer months. There are some fantastic buys to be had in these slow periods. I have consulted with several  eBay Powersellers who in the summer slow down, concentrate on buying product on eBay from sellers who need to move the inventory for cash.  Here are a few tips to help you get the lowest possible price. When you type in a search term on eBay also type "n/r", this stands for No Reserve, meaning if the auction started at a penny it could sell for 1 penny if no one else bid on the item. Also type in "No Reserve" along with the item description.  Look for auctions ending at odd hours, late at night or early in the morning. Then simply place your bid from any one of several eBay sniping programs.  There is always an opportunity on eBay, when times are slow look to add inventory the peak fall and Christmas seasons.

I just read an announcement this morning in The San Diego Union Tribune, Auctiondrop eBay drop off service will be rolling out nationwide service to 3400 locations. This will be interesting!

I have sold full time on eBay for over 3 years, I could be wrong but this sounds like a complete disaster waiting to happen. How on earth are they going to handle the logistics of items not selling, being described properly, returns, emails questions etc etc Wow   I think I had a nightmare just thing about it. I checked Auction Drop feedback and it is very good for their volume, but as you may or may not know when you are trying to secure funding or partnerships they are bending over backward to keep that clean right now. These are my thoughts and I am open to any other opinions.  A friend of mine went to eBay live and in one of the discussion groups an employee of Auctiondrop stated that the business model was flawed. Wow, don't put your money on that pony.  They also will charge up to 40% of the final Sale. I think this will be a great opportunity for individuals to offer this service with better support and s
