Why on earth can't Australia get good hardware such as more Biostar gear, Yeong-Yang, more Cooler Master gear, Sea Sonic, TTGI, more Thermaltake gear, Kingwin, FIC, Case Edge, Foxconn??  All the Australian enthusiest sites could do is refer links to reviews to cool gear on other sites that'd take eons if not for ever to get to our shores. It's like saying "Guys look here at this cool piece of hardware. You'll never be able to buy it so here's a link. HAHAHA!"
Argh, been out all night celebrating Jane's birthday at Greenbox. Must get up at 8 am.   Trying to squeeze a quick duck down to the snow. Need an extra car from somewhere or some one.    I'm screwed. I hate Mondays.

Argh. Being bombarded to go skiing Macquarie Uni friends. But I have to work. But classes start as well. Stupid Club-Macq'ers, why do they always get an extra week of fun?!
1 Pass, 2 Credits.    Note to self.  In the first few weeks, drop/reconsider the subject when any two or more of the following combination occurs:       the lecturer turns up late once too often     course outline contains excessive amounts of errata     not all work turned in is assessed     the lecturer delegates student representatives to deal with course issues     the lecturer is not responsive to student concerns  the lecturer delgates teaching reponsibilities to a proxy lecturer once too often

Picked up parents after they finished their one week trip. All I can say is that though I like the peace and quiet, the chores where a pain in the arse.
w00t.  What a bizzare week its been. Things at work turning upside-down. People you haven't seen in ages. Two parties, two nights: HKSS/UCS/CSS on Thursday night then ClubSingapura on Friday night. I keep having to reiterate to my friends my policy regarding nightclubs and chicks: I don't pick up in nightclubs beacuse I don't want no bimbo hoe. William tells me there should be an IQ screening device outside every nightclub along with the usual security and door-bitch ontarage.  Bledisloe Cup duty tonight, hope Australia wins. City to Surf tomorrow, Candy has been delgated the role of personal alarm clock.  Cafe del Mar 11 is sick, fully.
