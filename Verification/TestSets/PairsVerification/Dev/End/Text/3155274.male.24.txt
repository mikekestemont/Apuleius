not friends, Tiny Tim.”    She whispered, “I don’t tell my friends things like that.    I’ve never talked like that in my life, but we’re not friends.    I don’t want you to get the wrong idea.”    She had tears in her eyes and walked out of the apartment in a hurry.    She didn’t come back for several hours, but Tiny Tim was fine because she’d left the TV on PBS for him.     About a week later the law student came home with her.    “Why’s the Game Show Network on?”    She’d been hoping tonight would be the night.    “You don’t like it?    I’ll put on something else,” and she opted for Goldfinger, hoping Sean Connery’s sleazy charm was enough to repel Tiny Tim.    It wasn’t.    He pushed up that loose piece of flooring she’d never discovered and crept out to find exactly thirty-two convex visions of a gigantic man smothering his only friend.    She started moaning, and he grunting, as clothing seemed to fall from everywhere until the two of them were naked and he wasn’t being gentle like she said he would, he was holding her down, arching his back, and slamming against her with grunt after grunt and the rising swell of the Bond soundtrack until a stern and crisp “snap” from under the couch broke their revelry and she shoved him off her and looked and screamed and screamed until the law student had wrapped her in a blanket and taken out the garbage.   “There had only been one left.”    She told him.    “I’d cleared them all away months ago, but forgot that one.    I didn’t see it behind there.    I didn’t know.”   He went home and didn’t return her calls.
Skin crawling hands shaking staring down a stack of sheets of names and addresses from Oklahoma City freaking out.  Revulsion at having to type another name.  Sickness at staring at paramedic’s sloppy scrawl and at a simple fact.  This is his life now.  This is every day with no end.  This is where that Bachelor’s degree settles, tapping plastic keys faster and faster until five   when he wishes to turn back into a real person…   with money in his pocket and…   and an itching thirst for something that tastes like real life.  It isn’t there.    Embers.  Ashes and fragments of leases and agreements and business confidences and attendance lists flutter around in his cage of a skull, scraps of names and phone numbers and to-do items, afloat.  Around.  They have a semi-automatic mailing machine  hum-smacking  half-time daily.  Red ink spots palms and at the fingernails, but mountain-climbing, both literal and metaphorical, are all the imagination can muster.   Hum-smack!   The gears are turning.  Red hands hover.   Hum-smack.    What have I butchered?   There’s no corpse.   The only corpse is me.   Struggling around his breezy life.  Comfort food and spas, chocolate and TV, and all sorts of dollar bills—never quite enough but all sorts that flutter away and  what’s so hard about that, you ass?   He asks himself.  He leaves the hall light on and tries to let Beethoven lull him to s
