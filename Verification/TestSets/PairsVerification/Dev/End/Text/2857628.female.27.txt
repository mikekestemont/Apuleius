I've worked for this client for three years. Some people just don't get it. This particular user sends panicky messages on a regular basis, usually copying her boss (who is my supervisor) and my boss. The server isn't down. The server is NEVER down. The server has never actually gone down at that client - in THREE YEARS. Yes. I'm THAT good.    Thanks to this email her boss/my supervisor will ask me WHY, possibly, this user thought the server was down. And I'll have to explain, again, that without a proper description of her problem, I can't even tell if there *was* a problem. Because, if she can access email to TELL ME that the server is down, the server isn't down.  I don't expect people to understand the basic concept of a network. That would be asking too much. I do expect people to give me a proper description of the problem they're encountering, if they expect me to fix it. Apparently, that is also asking too much.

Dear *censored-association-person*:  I need more information. If the server was actually down, you wouldn't be able to access email, which you can. Can you not access files? Is it via the VPN? What exactly are you having problems accessing?  Thanks, Molly
I feel invincible today. So invincible that I walked/ran 4 miles, and hefted a TV twice as wide as me upstairs without dropping it.  This weekend I was in NYC with my friend  urlLink Colleen  who, as i've mentioned before, is fabulous. She lives in a great neighborhood with a roommate and a crazy dogcat named Bill. The rest of my family was also in town, and my dad only made one inappropriate comment all night. It was a good night.
I've been reading the blogs from the DNC. I understand that journalism has gone to shit, really, but could we at least use the spell check? And is "stupider" a word? I'm completely f
