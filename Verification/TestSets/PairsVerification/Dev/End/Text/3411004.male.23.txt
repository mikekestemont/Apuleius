to the DR, I have pretty much been just enjoying the summertime.&nbsp; Tubing, kicking back with family, and enjoying the hot weather have been my most enjoyed pastimes the last couple of months.&nbsp; I'm still working full-time but it's nice not having to worry about homework all time the time now.&nbsp; But, school will be beginning again soon.&nbsp;*sigh*&nbsp; Oh well, I still have a month of vacation left so let's see if I can use it to its fullest potential!  * The rule of the big chicken is pretty simple.&nbsp; Whoever is the biggest chicken (i.e. the MACK truck, the bus, the truck, the car, the moped, the person--pretty much in that order of ferocity) wins.&nbsp; Basically you do not challenge the bigger chicken. =)&nbsp;
Here are some of the websites that I have looked at today that sparked my interest.

So, I haven&#8217;t been able to update my blog for a couple days and I&#8217;m sure world wants to know what the latest scoop from Michael&#8217;s blog is!        &nbsp;        Well, nothing much has been happening on the work front.&nbsp; My boss is out of town for the week so it&#8217;s been really busy trying to make sure everything goes smoothly on our organization&#8217;s network.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been so busy in fact that I haven&#8217;t had a chance to post to my blog for the past couple days! =(&nbsp; Well, to make a long story short I still don&#8217;t really have any time to post to my blog so you will all have to wait until later to see another posting! :P        &nbsp;        If you&#8217;re dying for a way to kill 5 minutes check out  urlLink Lauren&#8217;s  blog at its new address and see her most recent posts.        &nbsp;        URL:  urlLink http://www.laurenwalters.com
It won't be long now.  urlLink  Michael Moore Hates America   will be released in theaters soon and I'm really interested to see what its creator, Michael Wilson, has to say about our nationâ€™s "#1 documentarian."  Don't get me wrong, I was one of the first in line to see what Michael Moore had to say in his recent film  Farenheit 9/11  and I gave him a fair chance to prove his point. Unfortunately, it was filled with  urlLink so many holes and misrepresentations of the truth it was unbelievable.  Now it's   Wilson  's turn to give the propaganda wheel a spin. Hopefully it's a pretty good film, and even more so, I hope it shows how a quote/unquote "documentarian" can put a completely biased spin on whatever subject he/she chooses to cover.
