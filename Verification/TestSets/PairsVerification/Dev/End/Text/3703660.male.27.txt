site it belongs to one of my ex mistakes (girlfriends) she thinks shes clever insulting people on it which is quite amusting she was a bit of a simplton when i was with her i guess not much has changed but thats what happens when people WANT to be irish and hang around with irish they suck the inteligence out of people but sheep have purposes they make the landscape look good and they save money on tractors cutting the grass you thick bitch (pmsl) the foerign people havent a clue about anything. i guess send them to ireland and sink it the only good thing about ireland is guinness and the paddys get foreign people to work their coz its cheaper. but ive never been better i never get dragged down by scum such as her. and when the time is right ill hurt her more than she imagined that would be worth all the money in the world coz she will wonder how i got the details to visit them people that insult me and my family whilst they are in their homes. jajajaja
