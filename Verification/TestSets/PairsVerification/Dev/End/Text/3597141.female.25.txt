with her new fiance kevin.   also i was wondering out loud why I hadnt seen any Kerry/Edwards commercials here on TV yet, and people at work reminded me that I live Bush country, and that there is no chance that John Kerry will "win" this state and hence he probably isnt wasting money on advertising here as much as else where. I mean it makes sense, but its just upsetting to think that millions of bush lovers here in texas will drown out my vote. Why can't we just adapt the popular vote system?   anyways maybe if I can get enough people to just take a look at Kerrys platform here he might stand a chance?  urlLink www.johnkerry.com
urlLink    BECKY the Band (from left to right) Keanu, Becky, Rob, Paulie www.beckyband.com
most of you probably don't know but mr reeves is an excellent bass player and played for years with the band dogstar. unfortunately they broke up, BUT there's a new band in LA that keanu has joined, "BECKY." this rock band, albeit pretty unknown, is pretty good. I listened to some mp3s today and they were pretty fun and catchy...the lead vocals are by Rebecca Lord, of Real World Seattle fame, and she has a great voice with a vast range....check out the free mp3s at  urlLink http://beckyband.com/multimedia.php  I like "Higher Ground" and "Evangeline" if you listen really hard you can hear the awesome bass skills of mr. reeves :) i hope they come to texas soon!
