me for pacing him.   He is used to running faster but by conserving energy early it enabled him to successfully complete with the temperature became hotter and more humid.  I wanted to run faster but I did not early for fear of injury and could not later as the heat drained me.  Concerns: 10 and 1 approach drains so much energy in the later stages. What will I do on race day.  Stopped at the park and walked back. As I was walked, the legs were becoming increasingly stiff with each step I was really hungry at the 25km mark. What strategy should I follow for the race on the big day?
In a park far far away .... from Toronto.  ahem.  excuse me.  It's the geek talking.  No training between last Friday and this morning unfortunately.  Real Life (tm) was taking up a good chunk of my time again.  Early this morning, I had a session with my PT.  The exercise today had to do with intervals.  She wanted to watch my stride/gait as I was running so we hit a track not too far away from the Goodlife that I train at.  Ran/walked/sprinted as much as I could over the next half hour.  I probably should've gotten more sleep the night before but I was busy with SJA.  And I probably should've eaten something but I didn't have anything appropriate in the fridge.  At least I drank enuf water. :)  At any rate, my PT said that my stride/form looked good (except for how I use my arms).  Gave me a few pointers on how to use my arms to my advantage while sprinting (loosen them up).   So, it's possible that it's not how I'm running that's causing shin splints.  And it doesn't look like my shoes are a problem.  So, ultimately, I still don't know why I get shin splints every so often. Good thing I've booked an appointment with a sports doctor.  Hopefully he'll be able to shed some light on the issue.  The session today gives me hope that I'll be able to do the half without any major problems.  BTW, Bonky... man you're making me look like a lazy ass... :)
August 14 2004 Time 10am Weather 20 degrees Humdit factor 4/10 Path, MAA to Lafontaine 2 loops and back How I felt before: Slightly tired from Thursday's practice Distance: 12km  What I ate before, yogurt banana Pace: brutal  Fatigue and an unknown pain from my originating from my left ankle relegated what was to be an easy run into a tough effort.  Not wanting to aggravate this pain, for Sunday's long run I ran slowly and could not for the duration of the outing find my rhythm and regular pace. Breathing was irregular and heart rate shot up fast despite the slow speed.  Time to completion 1.5 hours. Rest break every 10min breaks became progessively longer as the session progressed. Running faster to establish a rhythm did not help as fatigue overwhelmed me.  Barely stretched, hit the shower and went home. Was famished and extremely t
