no particular order of foods I ate either entirely or had parts of:  Cheese curds Cheese on a stick White chocolate/cranberry cookie Blackberry-cranberry juice Apple Cider Sour cream and chive fries (courtesy of Saz's--yum!) Curly cut potato chips Hot dog w/ ketchup and mustard Shrimp fried rice ice cream Sprite Bottled water various samples of pretzels and dip, cheese, beef jerky, and other fair food  mmm, mmm, gotta love fair food.  If my complexion wasn't already in enough trouble, I'm surely going to suffer now.  Saw all sorts of the newest inventions--the world's greatest mop, juicer, car and cell phone accessories, hair and beauty products, useless crap, interesting crap, etc. etc.  Missed the animal barns :(  Then spent last night bar hopping and celebrating a birthday.  I normally don't have fun at bars but this was definitely an exception, and I don't think I paid for a drink all night.  By bar time I wasn't feeling ok to drive so we went across the street to an all night restaurant and had some coffee and chicken tenders.   I listened without a word and with considerable composure as a friend across the table looked me in the eyes and tell me he had fallen for me.  I had no answers for him, and said as much.  He knows some of my situation, and can't, or won't, understand the rest.

I am hurt because I hate drama like this, and because I don't want to reject him but the alternative is out of the question.   Fondness and friendship is no reason to become involved.  But to finish my story, I crashed at a safe place until I woke up around 5:30 and drove home.  I'm becoming increasingly grateful for 3-day weekends.   I need to start organizing my time better, however.  The more busy and social I am the less time I spend with Jesus and the more I do things like drink and give attention to boys.  I'm fairly sure this is not why God sent me to Milwaukee.   I am not sure why yet, but I doubt these activities will speed my finding out.  I am learning more about myself though.  And I am learning to know myself better and more clearly see the bigger picture.  I had inklings of it before, but it's coming into a better focus.  I am g
