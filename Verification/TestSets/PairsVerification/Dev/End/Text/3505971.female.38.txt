most of which have to do with the fact that I am a big loser.  Item #1 I need to be writing/reading and am not.  Item #2 It turns out that the entire "relationship" with Rhett was in my head, as I have not heard a peep from him, and I regret a. sending him a postcard from Ireland, b. leaving a message for him upon my return, and not to mention c. having crazy sex with him when clearly he doesn't really care about me one way or another.  Item #3 Fox is in Cali, and I suspect I will never fuck him.  Item #4 I am not a very amazing academic, in spite of my efforts.  On top of this, I think I'll need to go on the market this year, just to see what's out there, but I fear nobody will recommend me.  I hate everything in the whole world, but, most of all, myself.  Academe + PMS = Doom + Gloom
There isn't much to report these days, as Rhett is out of town, Fox is defending his dissertation on Monday and so is no fun, and I have absolutely no holiday weekend plans, other than to lay in the sun (which, yes, causes cancer, but also causes a glorious golden - and not orange - suntan) and to feel sorry for myself.    The main problem in my life right now is indicated by the title of this post: I am a Tiffani divided.  All of the parts of my life have separated from one another, and this means that I have to watch what I say in all manner of situations.  Example 1: I went to dinner with colleagues last night and I had to gloss over 90% of my trip when telling them about it because I couldn't let them think that I had any sort of relations with Lancelot as it might get back to Rhett, whom I don't want to bother with the details of that relationship.  Example 2: I can't talk about Lancelot or Rhett if I'm on the phone on my balcony, as Fox might come out onto his balcony and find out that I am a big whore.  Example 3:  I can't invite Rhett over to my house until Fox moves away because I think Rhett would be bothered if he knew about my making out with Fox or if he suspected some sort of intimacy between us.  Similarly, I don't really want Fox to know about Rhett, as it's not really any of his business that I've got a suitor.  Candi thinks that my chances of fucking Fox would be greater if he knew that I had another suitor, but this doesn't sit well with me for some reason.  Since all of this is the case, I suspect I should focus on work and refuse to be distracted and boy-crazy.  This is difficult, as working makes me want to scratch my eyes out.  Next week: look for angry posts about the futility of revising ones dissertation into a book m
