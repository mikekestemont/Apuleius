for my pregnancy, but, i have _so_ many other things to do, and if it takes me a couple of weeks, well... we'll see. :P  i may just save it and make it for next year.
I don't think it's your math abilities.  I did a swatch, took measurements, and my tank is also a bit on the gigantic side.  I'm just working on some spinning, trying to convince myself to frog the whole thing and start over in a smaller size ;P
thanks! that makes much more sense than 2. :P  so i got the front and back done, and sewn up.  tried it on, and it's HUMONGUS.  so, i'm starting over, with some modifications.  i'm not going to do the bottom shaping.  it just looked too wierd with the cotton. it just didn't lay right.  second one should be much faster, since i am making it 25 stiches narrower!  i did do a guage swatch! really!  i must just not be able to do math... or something.
It's six wraps on each side--twice. So 12 wraps on each side total for a D cup.
so i'm almost up to the increases on the back.  the front is "done"  i'm hoping i got the short rows right for the bustline.   when it says "1 time for a C, 2 times for a D etc..." does that mean that there should be 2 wraps on each side for a D?  it's what i thought, but now that i'm done, it just doesn't seem quite enough.  i decided rather belatedly, that i was going to wear this thing tomorrow.  :-P  yeah.  right.  we'll see how much more i get done today.  i've spent nearly 6 hours and i've got about 20 more rows before i get to the armholes.    Happy 4th everyone!
Michelle, I'm calling mine the 'not-so-shapely' because I decided not to do any shaping. My body doesn't have much shape any more, so I've made the tank straight up and down (like me!) wihtout the decreases and increases. I can only  hope  it doesn't turn out baggy. But then again, cotton does have a tendency to sag with wearing. What the heck, I'll wear it anyway. I'll be proud to say I made it myself. Mary
After reading of everyone's problems with this tank(tee), I'm wondering why on earth anyone would want to make another one, no less frog it and start over. I've tried seaming my baggy tank an inch smaller on each side. It still looks bad. So I thought maybe I need to seam the underarm part a little tighter. And then I wondered how the heck I was supposed to get a proper band on the armholes if I did that. And now it's just hit me - why the heck don't I just rip the whole dang thing out, period? When a garment gives so much trouble, maybe nothing at all will fix it. I really feel cheated, after spending so much time knitting it up, and waiting expectantly for the results. The yarn just might make a better-looking baby s
