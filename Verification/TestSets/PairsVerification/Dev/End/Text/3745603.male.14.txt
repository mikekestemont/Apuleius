sticking them in the fridge to cool. While it was cooling, we noticed that we didnt have nearly enough frosting, so we needed to make some more. Every book we looked at involve this tarter crap which we didnt have, so we played it by ear, or mouth i guess, by melting chocolate, them tasting it while adding milk, vanilla, and sugar. Lots and lots of sugar. We were planing to use both kinds of frosting, but neither tasted anything like the other, so we decided to mix the two together. That doesnt sound very funny online, but at the time we were rolling on the floor laughing at the idea. I dont know why, but we were. So, after 2 more FG episodes, we pulled out the cakes, poured the frosting on, (yes, poured) and put the candles on. When my mom got home, we suprised her and sung and all that jazz, then she suggested we eat it, and Kristen and i were like, 'NO THANK YOU'! lol. After tasting everything for 2 hours, we had enough. So now, im full of cake and everything's happy. Ok, that is all. Oh and there a couple of pix below. Peace!!
Today was boring as hell. I went to cut my grandparent grass, and made $20. Thats always pretty cool. By the way, if you dont know already, i have a new email adress.  urlLink DarkMatter08@hotmail.com . And if your too stupid to realize, especially if you were in the class of '04 NB with this in your computer login, the 08 in my email, sn, and blog url, stand for the year i graduate from high school. Im currently watching Jon Stewart, which shows that i do prefer the sofisticated lifestyle. Actualy, only someone as dumb as out president wouldnt get the jokes on it. After this im going to watch Jay Leno, with guest Dennis Miller. Funny guy Dennis Miller. Then i will watch Conan, who is also very funny, then ill watch about 3 Family Guy episodes, drink a milkshake, then go to bed. Ok, *yawn*. Enough of this crap!
Yesterday, the day that Heather was soposed to come back and visit, was a very dissapointing day.  She never came, meaning no reward. By the way, if your wondering why Peter and I deserve our rewards, Pete summed it up vey nicely in a post on his blog ( urlLink http://peterspeaksenglish.blogspot.com ).  Nothing happened yesterday except that i want to a tile store to pick out bathroom tiles for the new house.  Not fun at all.  We're going to have a baige, sandy type floor tile, the white tiles up the walls about 1/2 way, then the top 1/2 of the wall we will paint some vibrant color.  It should look pretty cool.  Nothing is happening today except for a few errands and mowing lawns for $.  I've made $100 at least this past week.  No i will not buy you anything.  Now im going to go listen to Bad Beligion and throw darts at a picture of Bush! P
