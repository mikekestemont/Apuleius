was a clear night, his room lit by the moonlight streaming through the window. Long shadows cast on the wall formed shapes of unmentionable things. He looked over at the clock….. 3:33pm. "What the...?" Jerms thought. “If it's 3:33pm, it can't be dark outside. Ok, so obviously, I'm still in a dream. Guess I'll close my eyes and see if I wake up for real this time.”  In that split second of time it takes for Jerms to close his eyes, he sees one of the shadows on the wall move. His eyes are now closed. He tries to open his eyes to find out what the shadow was, but they do not open. His eyes are shut tight by an unseen force. Jerms strains his eyelid opening muscles to open them. Even all that training in the eyelid Olympics could not prepare him to counter this strength. He gropes in the darkness and puts his hands to his eyes. “Ah! Who’s there! Help! Can’t…..open….”   Jerms’ eyes open. He is still in his room, but everything is all wrong. Shadow and light are reversed. What once was shadow is now solid and clear. Things that were once solid are now dark and fuzzy. He looks at his own hands, they too have turned to shadow, and are blurry around the edges. Jerms notices someone staring at him, and gives a little yelp.  “I am Pu of the shadow world. Welcome,” says the figure standing only a few feet away.  Oddly, the man looks vaguely familiar to Jerms. “Do I know you from somewhere? Oh I get it. Of course. I’m dreaming. We always see familiar faces in our dreams.” Jerms is trying hard to be logical about it. “So... perhaps you could give me the standard explanation-of-what’s-going-on speech at least?” Jerms asks.  “Yes. I was just about to get to that. You have entered the world of what’s seen in your world as shadow. To you, our world is seen as shadow. To us, your world forms our shadows. Since you have managed to foolishly land yourself in our world, you have turned into a shadow. Quite interesting actually.”  “OK this is kinda cool, but creeping me out. I really need to wake up now,” jerms says. But something deep inside his brain tells him he is already awake.
This is gonna be awesome like the old days. Me and the Pu used to write stories for our friends. They made you laugh, they made you cry...heck, they even made you pu. Once again, pu and jerms join forces to bring you the most entertaining of stories...as pu put it, "...unknown to mankind."
welcome one welcome all to the pj stories blog... here you will find random stories generated by two of the greatest figures unknown to mankind: pu &amp; jerms... sometimes the stories connects... sometimes they are vastly different... it all depends upon the moods of the authors... one day perhaps, order will be sorted from chaos and the authors will be rich from the stories they generated... but until then... e
