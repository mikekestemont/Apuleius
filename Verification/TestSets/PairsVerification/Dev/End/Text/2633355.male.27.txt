be no balance. We would either be chronically happy or eternally miserable and not even know it. You must change your perspective. There cannot be happy without sad, so if you are sad, know that happy is just around the corner. But most importantly, you must come to this conclusion on your own. We all know these things, but we must  realize  them. We must understand the implications of being sad and being happy. Never accept what someone is telling you simply because it is in a book or a blog. Most blogs are full of shit. I am not so arrogant to insinuate that this blog is not full of shit as well. That is a conclusion you must draw yourself.
Have you ever just been driving, daydreaming about how cool you are and disappointed that nobody else realizes how cool you are? This is called being stupid. Being the cause of your own disappointment is heartbreaking. Worse than that, you're relying on others to determine your worth. Daydreaming about how cool you are is alright, but stop there. Why place your peace of mind in the hands of another person just as confused as you?

I found a website today that sells post-modern theorists action figures. My initial thought was, how can a thinker have an action figure? Aha! Even the post-modern can be post-modern.

I grasp the concept like a rock-climber hanging one-handed from a small ledge on a mountain side, the ledge being my knowledge of the post-modern and the mountain being all it encompasses. I appreciate the work of Jameson and Adorno, but I'm afraid they are just as confused as I am.

If you had one year left to live, would you spend it selfishly adventuring, doing all the things you never found the time do? Running with the Bulls, perhaps? Navigating the treacherous Amazon River? Hitchhiking across the States? Or would you cherish your last days with your family and friends? Go to the ballpark, maybe? Work on the car with your dad? Feed your infant nephew from a bottle? Cry over a sappy movie with your sister?  The fact is, today is always the last day of your life as you know it. Never again will you be as innocent as you are this very moment. Innocence is valuable. If you have any doubt, observe any child for just a few minutes. They have no concept of tomorrow. They do not plan ahead, they live. They live. This is the only c
