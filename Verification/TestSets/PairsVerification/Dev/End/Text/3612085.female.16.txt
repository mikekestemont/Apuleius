 No one else in the world can even compare, You're perfect and so is this love that we share.  We have so much more than I ever thought we would, I love you more than I ever thought I could.  I promise to give you all I have to give, I'll do anything for you as long as I live.  In your eyes I see our present, our future and past, By the way you look at me I know we will last.  I hope that one day you'll come to realize, How perfect you are when seen through my eyes.  - Ashley Borden -  Don't u just luv that poem?

Love easily breaks A heart once whole, Love easily takes A happy soul  And once it rips my heart apart Sewing of stitches gingerly start To heal a scarred and roughed up heart So tattered and torn by every thorn And finally when the day is done And when the moon has hid the sun I toss and turn within my bed The voices echo in my head  I see his face surrounding me "Stop haunting me!" I scream and pleed He shakes his and sneers at me "Not til you say the magic please!" I say a please; he laughs coldly "I'll never leave!" he taunts at me So then I punch his pretty face I look at his ruins with distaste I spit and say, "You were such a waste."  Then dawn breaks thru the silent dark A cheerful song brought by a lark I wake up very drowsily And make my bed so groggily The sun sheds light into my day A smile slowly plays across my face I sigh with relief and throw my arms out An angel holds me and with no doubts He takes me to a better place  where smiles are always on my face   >brokengurl13 >  I made that one up last nite and it took me from 9 - 11pm to come up w/this..but i think its pretty good.  well plz post ur comments!
