one. Gas is stupidly expensive and insurance sucks big bull dork. I'll save up and hopefully by the end of the year I can get something.  Earth out.
Hi,  I went to SF on Sunday to see some bands play at the Fillmore. I had never been to The Fillmore and was most impressed by the number of great bands that have played there. They have framed posters lining the walls of the shows. If you ever get the chance to see a show there, just looking at the posters and being in that place is worth the price of admission.  Anyway, a friend from work and I went to see the show. The line-up was The Hives, Sahara Hotnights, and The Reigning Sound. All Swedish bands (on the same label, I take it). My take on the night was that for $20 I got a great deal. The Reigning Sound opened. I was not impressed. But that doesn't mean that they aren't good. I just personally didn't like them.  The next band was Sahara Hotnights, who I saw at Coachella Music Festival on May 1, 2004. This is a four piece all girl band that looks great and sounds even better. To tell the truth, I bought the tickets for the show because I wanted to see them again. (I didn't even know who The Hives were!) They just kicked maximum booty at Coachella, and I was looking forward to another great performance. Well they did just that, and despite having a short set (30 minutes!!!) they kicked arse again. They are out supporting a new album (Kiss and Tell), and played 7 or 8 songs off of it, plus some stuff off of "Jenny Bomb". And I got to dancing with a really cute girl (who I did not know) that was right next to me, well kind of dancing... (is head banging, smiling, and looking at each other and shouting out the lyrics dancing?)  Then came the Hives...  Stunned I was, for a bit and then started SCREAMING! So did everybody else. Talk about steal a show! F&amp;*k Mick Jagger with an iron mine, Pelle Almvquist is the SHIT! A frontman to DIE for. He knew what he was doing when, a few songs into the set, he asked if anyone else wanted to point at him (because someone was), using that universal "sign" and everyone did. And for good measure he went out into the crowd 3 times and they just lifted him back up onstage. Great band all around, a drummer that kicks tail and a lead guitarist that is nothing less than a phenom. They just got the crowd going and never let up! I was actually quite amazed and can't quite put into words what I really saw. Volvo's are nice but if Sweden keeps producing bands like Hotnights and The Hives, we'll be buying millions more cds than cars from them.   Sam  Any good music is appreciated, let me know what you are listening to thats new, fresh and no one has heard o
