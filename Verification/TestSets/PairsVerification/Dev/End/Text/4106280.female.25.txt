up a wall on an hourly basis. What's the age of reason again? 7? Please, God, help me get through these next 4 years  without  losing my mind or doing something I regret to my little cherub. In the mean time, while she is napping, I am going to shower! Without worrying if she's climbed up the shelves in the closet to help mommy clean the sofa cushions with the soft scrub with bleach. Yipee!
Right now I feel cranky and depressed. Cranky because I've been inattentive to my 3 yr. old, procrastinating, and I haven't done my usual exercise routing since Wednesday. I have a lot on my plate so I am feeling overwhelmed but I'm not helping myself out or anything by being a blob. Right now I should be writing my 3 essays for my admissions interview to CCMT and writing my resume. I have been "working" on them for 2.5 weeks. Its not that they are that hard its just I have this phobia about writing anything structural. Like if I follow the format for a proper essay I have to live within those confines. It makes me feel uneasy and panicky. What if I can't say what I need to in the right way? Or what are the right words? How do these 300 words convey who I am or encompass everything I have learned? Maybe I feel like this because I have yet to discover or define who I am. I am still searching. (I hope there are many others out there still asking questions and trying to look at things in many ways.) Its frustrating being 25 and still not know who I am. I know pretty much what I am. I am just wondering how some people can sit down and compose an essay in 30 min. and hit print and be fine with it. To me, that's an amazing gift. Is it because they have incredible inner piece? They are content with who they are in the present? Do they just not give a shit? Am I being incredibly over analytical? I'm gonna go with number 4. So I am a bit wacked out about this. Well I am off to go to mass. Yes I said mass, as in church, as in God, praying and the like. But, that is a topic for another entry...
Thats just it.  Reality is.  It can be a relief or a slap in the face.  It can support your ideas and feelings or make it painfully obvious that you are wrong.  Its all what you realize.  Real eyes.  Real lies.  I have, unfortunately, lied to myself too often about some things that I have or have not done.  Some of the borders between "what is" and "what I wish it was" are getting too fuzzy.  This is my attempt to lay it all out there and look at it on black and white...carve the line that separates what I am from what I think others and myself should view me as.  I hope I am ready.  B
