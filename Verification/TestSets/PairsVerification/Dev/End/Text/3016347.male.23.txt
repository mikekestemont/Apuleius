dissappointed.........as humans are getting more and more civillized or opposite, things tend to change.  cases of murder, suicide and etc is getting worse day by day, yeah, the cost of development by sacrificing the ethical and moral values of human. i read a lot of ethical journals these days and some of it are really interesting than the story books, tells us more about 'us' in terms of behaviour and our attitude. it is sad that to satisfy our needs or......etc, we tend to sacrifice others...........is this worth it?  few days ago, a couple was killed, slit their throat and stab on the stomach and then was thrown into a lake, why? because they were at the wrong place and at the wrong time. just because of some cash and handphones, they end up like this, which they should not. they are less than 2o yrs old, and they do not deserve this. the robbers? indians or malay, i do not know but i wish that one day, they will get wat they did......... how do they feel when they put a knife into someones neck or stomach? is money really that important that the life of a human being can be sacrificed? i do not know............. does all this worth it?  and today, a dad killed their own child before hanging himself, why? because he is going to separate with his wife and as his wife earns more than him, chances of getting the right to take k of the children is very slim. the father and his 3 children are very upset about this as their family is going to break up. in the end, on his daughter birthday 3rd aug (celeb early), the father brought all his children to celebrate and then, he strangled all of them before hanging himself.  3 of his children are really good looking and pretty, should they deserve this? NO! they deserve a better one.........when i read the  urlLink Star  today, i felt really sad, not because of wat the dad did and wat happened to the family but because of the kids. the parents had the problems and now the innocent kids are the victim.  Hope that they will rest in peace........................................  bloody 24hrs........headlines for The Malay Mail................................. is there hope in humanity? i do not know...............................
