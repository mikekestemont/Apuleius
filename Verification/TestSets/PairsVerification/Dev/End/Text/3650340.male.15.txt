  “How did he die, father?”, asked Jeremy.  “He’d gone out one night and never returned. Fell of a cliff...or pushed as some say…We’ll never know. We didn’t find his body, so we buried his belongings.”   “But who killed him?”   “We’ll never know, son...no one knows…”     “Wow!! Cool story, Grandma!! Really spooky! Can we hear another one! Please, Grandma!! ”, said the kids. Grandmother, however, could not take it anymore…for her it was no story…for her it was the truth. She was Mrs. Jeremy Rice and her husband had gone out a few years back, never to return...She’d always dreamt of him coming back to her...to his family. She’d never lost hope…A tear trickled down her cheek. She went out of the house and picked up a blooming flower from the garden. She then went and placed it atop the tombstone at the edge of the garden. She smiled as she read the name engraved on it, “In Memory of COLONEL J. RICE- Rest in Peace”.  Bu whatever her pains, she was happy- atleast the kids had enjoyed every moment of it!   Tejas
