However, I still decided not to go to school as I couldn't get up this morning. Thanks to yesterdays movie with my cuz. But the movie 'Ella Enchanted' is kinda nice.. I mean for those who loves fairy tales n their '...live happily ever after' endings, you would definitely love it. I got back at 10 plus at night and felt super tired. So.. that's why this morning was like so.... harddd! Errmmxx.. after all the sleeping I've had, my 'brox' asked me out n there I was out, although I thought I was grounded. ~Geex~There Kaiwen shifu, xuheng shifu n ah tat was. We met up at Tampines small mac and we headed for.... almost anywhere at TM. Lol. Boring huh?! Can't help it. Too bored at home already. We just walked around then finally went to mac, opposite cpf building and ate our dinner. From then on. we just sat there and chatted. Kinda funny manx. Lolx.. We coincidentally met sunny, wx n joan... Bryan then came n find us after the speech day thingy. Lol.. we all then chatted and so on. Hmm.. not bad la. At least didn't rot at home today. Hahahax..
