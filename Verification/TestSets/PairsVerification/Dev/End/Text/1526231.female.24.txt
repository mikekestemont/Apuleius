pings and opens. I turn around and a man and woman stand outside. The woman stands slightly hunched, her head titled with an almost gawking expression from her mouth. Puzzling. I step out and head my way and as I open the door hear her commenting about getting out of the elevator.    Apparently there's a millisecond rule for elevators, and it's rude to stand any longer. Of course, she probably didn't take into consideration how very curious she looked, and I figured her expresiion was one of surprise that I did not run out of the elevator, so I lingered for an entire half a milli-second to ponder her very interesting looking body language.  Yes, there was a second of anger as well as a desire to go snip back at her. But as I thought to myself that she must have a bug up her ass, I felt a bit of glee that I have no such problem, and did a little skip down the sidewalk.
All quiet on the western front. No hoard of media stomping through to see the announcement so widely touted by colleagues. Makes me seem a bit more successful. Not sure when I'll write again, as I'm in away from computers starting his afternoon until the 14th. What will await my inbox, I dread to read. But vacation is much needed, as well as outdoors. Speaking of which, the arboretum here's very nice. Lots of trails and pretty trees and cute lgbs (little grey birds). Party last night fun, despite the sudden appearance of a particular person. They did leave eventually, so all was well. Cliques. Someone mentioned cliques. As usual, I feel insulted. Mentioning cliques in my presence is tatamount to accusing me of being in one and excluding others. Maybe my coworkers are, I'm not sure. You do get inside jokes when you work with a small subset all the time, but still, cliques? Honey, if you think I'm in one cause you didn't see me or get invited by me anywhere, that's b/c I wasn't anywhere, I was off by myself or with my mom, or hoping someone will invite me to go out. Anyway.  I would say send me your address and I'll send you a postcard, but I won't get your email in time I suspect. Oh well. I'll try to remember all my peeps and bring home a goody bag (a summertime santa of sorts, 'cept you don't need to be good).  Hope all are well out there.
It's finally happened- I miss the boy. There's enough downtime to think about him.
My body still treats the world in its old time zone. So I wake up at three and find myself getting to work around 7 everyday.  This morning on my walk I was greeted by what looked like a  urlLink coatamundi .  Except bigger and not so stripy.  I don't know Northwestern mammals.  Anyway, very tired, another five hours to go of talks, dinners and photograhpy.  Yikes.  Boy is very cute. Left me a message last night.  So sweet ;
