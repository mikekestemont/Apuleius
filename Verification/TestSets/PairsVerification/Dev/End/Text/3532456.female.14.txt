me review what I have been doing over these long weekend !!!     Fri:    We had our usual National Day celebrations and as usual Andersonians are to be innovative, we had the very first Anderson'Yeah' T-shirt !!! The idea of 'Yeah' is rather lame but it's quite cool seeing everybody wearing the same T-shirt and I am starting to like wearing it cos it's quite 'cooling'...Hehe !!! Went to be a garang guni for a few hours as we went along collecting old newspapers. Sighx...the result is so disappointing cos my group onli managed to collect from one house. Pathetic rite ? The rest of the residents either refuse to open the door, think we are salesmen or they are not even at home, considering that it is a fri morning and they do not have the luxury to have a half-day off at work.... Slacked all the way till choir in the late afternoon and the rest is period.     Sat:     Nothing much to blog realli cos I spent the whole day at home, slogging for my tests. Probably the idea of a long weekend got into my head and I din realli do as much as I expected...haha !!!  Watched a bit of TV at nite and there was this "Idol" show on Ch U which realli showed the difference btw the beautiful and ugly !!! There was the particular girl who was veri sweet-looking, it is understandable why she got thru the first round cos she's pretty and got the X-factor. But I dun understand why she can get thru the second round. She totally can't hold a tune !!! She started out quite okay, acceptable to the ears but when she got to the more difficult parts where she have to hit the powerful notes, she totally screeched !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! To think no one from the audience voted her out, so biased !!! Sighx. The power of beauty...... Thus she went to Taiwan with two other girls who can hold a better tune than her !!! Their first task was to do a recording of a song on the spot and the judge was Lin Zi Liang !!!! Bad taste totally....never liked his voice realli...sound too airy and as u may have guessed, he chose the girl when the other two could sing better !!! Double sighx. Once again the power of beauty, should not have gotten a male judge !!!! Haha...... Therefore, she ended up being the "Idol of the Week" which in sum way she deserves it and in sum way she does not !!! Hehe...no offense !!!  Sun: Went to church as usual...everybody was kinda relaxed cos it's the hols !!! Sermon was on PROBLEMS. It's realli amazing how everything in our lives can be closely related to what the Bible says..... Mission trip....I am so looking forward to it, I will continue praying for it !!!!  As for now, I shall blog tmr abt NDP !!!! Haha...     Once again, Happy Birthday Singapore !!!!!
