picture of Aaron, sorry I was typing without thinking. I was excited to see The Honorary Title again, I bought a T-shirt and talked to Jarrod and Aaron for a bit. I didn't really like the other opening bands and Jen and I didn't even stay for the headlining band. But it was the best concert I've ever been to, except for Radiohead and the other Honorary Title concert I went to...  I hope they come around again, or I will make sure to go see them somewhere, they said they're headed home now, and they hope to get their own tour going sometime. Well I wish them the best of luck, they are an amazing band. If anyone wants to check them out, their Cd is for sale for like $10 at Home of the Hits on Elmwood, and their website is  urlLink www.thehonorarytitle.com  or  urlLink www.purevolume.com/thehonorarytitle  .  Jen and I ate at Applebees after the concert and I used an ATM machine for the first time ever, it was exciting. We didn't have enough money for a tip so I left a note and a pack of gum, oh and a Sacajawea (I don't know if I spelled that right). Thank you Jen for making my night a blast.  We also had a screaming rant after the concert in the car on the way home which was hilarious, just yelling stuff that made no sense with a whole lot of profanities, I guess energy was high.  Well I'm in a really good mood now, I went out for the first night in weeks last night and I feel really good. I guess I need to start some sort of life to feel okay. I miss my sister, among a million other things and people. Well... I'll be hoping for snow days from the first day of school I guess... just like every other day of high school I've ever had... oh well, one more year  "Please let the snow swallow the streets whole, keep the bus from coming, let us stay at home..."
