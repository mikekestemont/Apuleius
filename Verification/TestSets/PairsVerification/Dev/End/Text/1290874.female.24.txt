my best to have a positive attitude. I will not think of financial woes all the time. I'll try to be a good teacher/student/researcher. I will not argue with my mom about anything. I will not spend money on dvds for a long while. I will minimize my internet use to 3 hrs at most. I will be considerate of my family's (even Margie's) feelings. I will try to lessen my sedentary lifestyle. I will not curse or say any cuss words. I will not be the sarcastic brat that i usually am. I will talk to God more openly about my feelings.
T.G.I.F   Finally the weekend's come  And everything is goin' down Nine to five and now it's time  For me to get around Good poppin' ain't no stoppin' everybody's in the mood Mind blowin' once you feel the music startin' to get to you Disco nights, party lights, it's all good for me  Thank God it's Friday Party lights, Friday night feelin' right It's a party Thank God it's Friday Party lights, Friday night feelin' right It's a party  from R.Kelly's "Thank God It's Friday"

The Shocker   (The amazing things we learn from the Internet  )      Follow this simple procedure:      Start with your outstretched hand, palm up.     Take your ring finger and touch it to your thumb.     Flatten your finger and thumb a bit, while your first, second and pinky fingers remain straight up.     Rotate your hand a little, so your straightened fingers are pointing somewhat sideways.  Congratulations, you have just made "The Shocker".          It is a gesture meant to indicate a sexual act, wherein the first and second fingers enter a vagina, while the errant pinky plunges into the anus; hence the "shock".   The gesture has taken on other, more explicit names like "Two in the pink and one in the stink" and "Two in the coot and one in the boot".    So, the next time you want to express your loathing for someone, you can try giving him the "shocker" instead of the usual "finger" gesture.
goddess of laziness   Its monday again and my laziness is starting again. I was supposed to go to school today to research* and finish checking my students' data sheets but I wanted to sleep all day. I feel so exhausted, tired and sleepy, so here i am.   I've spent my weekend with my friends at Wewe's house for our long overdue DVD marathon. It gave me the taste of living with them albeit for a short period only. And i realized I'm not yet ready to live independently. My friends did all the cooking and cleaning stuff while all I could offer to do was buy Coke from the sari-sari store nearby.   Since I got home from Wewe's place, I've been sleeping as if i slipped into a coma. I couldnt even command myself to write my "things-to-do" schedule for the week, or fix my schoolbag at the very least.  I hope this is just a one-day debacle. --------------------  *research- anything that is related to my thesis and accomplishment t
