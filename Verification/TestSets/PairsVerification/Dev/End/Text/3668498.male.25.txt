and touch it up.  Should be done before the weekend.
Shaved today and I feel like a little kid now.  People have told me I look like I'm 15 yrs old when I'm clean shaven.  I hope not.  I'm goin to be job hunting soon so I figured I'd clean up a bit.  Working overnights you tend to neglect shaving since there is no dress code.  That doesn't mean I can go to work naked or anything but ... ya know .. we all wear clothes that are beat up with holes and stains because we usually get very dirty in our line of work.  O well check out the baby face..            Cheddacheesepleez Deun/Dan
I've been keeping busy.  I don't know why but I've been feeling real good lately.  I always try to have a positive attitude but lately its like I just wake up smiling.  It feels like I'm in love but without a chick :).  Ya know when your in love how fkn dumb you get all smiling and happy.  I don't know what's up.  I not doing drugs or anything lol.  O well it feels good so fk it.      I have 3 days off from work this week!! in a row!!.  I've been drawing like a mutha and catching up with different projects I am working on.  I've been looking into my insurance plan from my job and I think I may be able to get that lazer surgery for my eyes.  Right now I have contacts but if I could get that surgery that would be so awsome.  I'm also looking into getting a camera cell phone. Woohoo!       A lady honked at me yesterday too!! I was cutting the grass out front all sweating and shit and a woman honked.  I looked up to see if it was someone I knew but it was just a cute girl smiling.  I know it might seem like nothing to you guys but me I barely see chicks around here.  I work overnight so I'm working with a bunch of 40 yr old guys and the only females around are the 40 yr old cashiers.  When I get out of work at around 7 am  the only people awake at that time are the senior citizens.  Now my job is very physically demanding so when I get out I'm still pumped and cannot go to sleep.  I end up sleeping in the afternoon, waking up just in time to get to work at 11 p m.  I'm not into malls and I don't know this area of Jersey well enough to find cool hang out places so having a girl honk at me was a big thing.  I've been so wrapped up with work, taking care of my family(Mom, sis's, bro, nephew, nieces) and trying to get a good portfolio going of my art, that finding a girlfriend has been in the very back of my mind.  Yea it gets lonely but I have faith the right girl will pop up.    Have fun Eva Ree Bod EE  Enjoy the beautiful weather  D
