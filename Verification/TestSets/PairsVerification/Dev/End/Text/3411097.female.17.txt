bbq and then she say i ate a lot!!! Yeah.. Oh pls.. pple ate more than me k?? What really angered me more is that Eileen already at 2 and she asked her to bbq one more than Yunling called her faster come and take if not i will eat up!! Wa liao.. am i really that gullible??? KaoZzz... So i didnt ate anymore chicken fillet and went home early!!! I really hate that gal!! I swear i going to go on diet and do very well for my A level.. For i noe she wanna compete with me.. Okie lor.. If that's the way she want things to be.. then i will compete with her till the end... Well pple say if there's something which can motivate u.. U will strive.. is this a form of motivation? i dunno but i noe i have one goal.. To win no matter what.. Oh yeah.. Forget abt that damn gal.. Actually today.. i went thru a lot of things.. I read yingZ diary.. I sit down to feel... I start asking myself what life is abt? Is it abt studying for students? Am i born just to achieve goals pple set for me? Am i alway going to follow my sis footsteps? Do you noe what? I had constantly being stress.. Everyone expect good results from me.. Everyone expect me going thru my sis footsteps.. But.. Have anyone asked what i want? I wan a life.. Diff from my sis.. During pri sch everyone expected me to go Swisscottage.. During Sec sch pple expect me to go JJC... But has anyone noe.. I had tried so hard to achieve those goals? Do you noe how i feel when i get back my PSLE when i was P6 when i saw those disappointment in my parents? No one understand.. Do you noe how i hate pple the 2nd daughter in the family? Now.. A level.. Everyone expected me to do as well as my sis.. Do u understand the stress? My teachers expected me to do well for my A level for my aggregate is 12 for my L1R5... But.. do u noe abt the constant stress i get??? Sometimes i wonder... Y cant i born in some other countries like USA.. where everyone can study in University.. I like studying but i dun like route learning..  Education= memorising.. Is this what the govt want to achieve?? And oh yeah.. how to i get motivated? Haha.. really feel like walking down Orchard Road watching a movie.. Enjoying the night breeze... But is it possible now? You noe wat? When i went out for more than 3hr to somewhere to walk.. I feel guilty.. I feel scared.. Cos everyone studying and i was jus.. idling.. Its so scary.. Time so little.. I feel.. i feel.. so insecure.. Scared.. I feel so useless.. To be exact.. I am overstress.. I have to go on diet and then.. do well in study.. Is it possible? Why is everyone putting pressure on me?? Me going crazy l
