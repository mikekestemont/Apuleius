As I'm writing this, there are 38 minutes left on this auction and I'm the high bidder.  I've been looking for a good road bike for a few weeks, and this is a great deal on a Trek 1000.

Ashley and I have decided it's time to get a dog.  We want a dog that doesn't shed and is low allergy.  Normally, this would leave us with a very narrow selection: poodle or terrier.  But thanks to the effort of some dog breeders in Australia there is another choice.  Below are some links to site about the Labradoodle (a low allergy mix between a standard poodle and a labrador.)  ---------- Forwarded message ---------- From: Daniel Norton   Date: Sat, 3 Jul 2004 18:30:47 -0700 (PDT) Subject: labradoodle info To: dnorton@gmail.com, anorton@gmail.com  about  urlLink about.com article   urlLink National Geographic article   urlLink dogbreedinfo.com   Breeders  urlLink breedersclub.net   urlLink http://www.labradoodle-dogs.com   urlLink http://dir.yahoo.com/.../Labradoodles/
