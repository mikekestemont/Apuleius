ticker to two nervous Japanese tourists and feeling oddly proud. The trains may be late, but at least we know by how many minutes, damn it.  3. Sandy dust under bare feet.
1. Rowan berries. Mountain ash trees are a-flame here. The berries are bright, bright scarlet and the leaves are a dusty jade. I love them because they are so bold and so intensely colourful at a time of year when so many things look a bit faded and and crispy and mildewy. They are also rather sad because they mean autumn is on the way.  2. Falling asleep in the shade over a book.  3. The squeaky noises that guinea pigs make.
1. Dried mango - sweet and chewy and free from fresh mango's dribbliness.  2. Walking home with black clouds piling up in the sky behind me.  3. Origami  urlLink mouse . This is one of the first models I learnt. This traditional design is simple but it has something essentially mousish about it. I prefer the traditional designs because of this. And being simple, it's easy to do a good job of them. This one is particularly good with thickish paper.
1. Spanish oj - it tastes properly of oranges - sourness, bitterness and all - which Florida juice does not. Florida juice tastes as if it has been sugared and watered down. The supermarket I use has recently changed hands and now offers both. Plus Spanish juice means fewer food miles. Hurrah.  2. Opening a packet of thick and beautifully patterned origami paper and using it to make a couple of models involving pleasing moves.  3. Washing your hair after a sticky day.
1. Feeling ill at work, going home, having a couple of hours' kip with a hot water bottle. I woke up feeling fine and was able to scoot back for an afternoon's work. I really, really like living so close to the office.  2. As juicy a piece of steak as I've ever had the pleasure of putting on my plate.  3.   urlLink The Remains of the Day   by  urlLink Kazuo Ishiguro  which I read in one sitting and enjoyed hugely. I was intrigued all the way through by the love story and fascinated by the manservant-gentleman relationship. The story-telling technique was masterly, too - Stevens is writing as his journey unfolds, so we really have no idea what is going to happen next in the outer story.
1. Walking a 20ft maze drawn in the sand.  2. Swimming in the sea on a hot day.  3. Mr Men ice lollies - small, cheap, tasty and free from artificial colourings, they are as welcome today as they were when I was at school.
1. Janet Ellis standing in on  Excess Baggage . Her chinchillaish voice vortexes me back to teatime television like  Jigsaw  and  Blue Peter .  2. A man sitting in the window of a cafe. Sunlight reflected off his cup of coffee rippled on his face.  3. Finding the perfect pair of shoes on the morning of the day I need them. They match my new u
