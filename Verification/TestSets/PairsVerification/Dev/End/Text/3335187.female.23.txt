bitch, so I ended up doing an associates degree in computer programming. Two years, piece of cake because I'm smart, and I can get a job right away because the market is booming. What a deal!  Of course, and I say "of course" because this is typical of my luck, 9-11 happens just before I graduate with my crisp degree and the recession gets worse and the field totally DIES. No job for the Cute Coder, sorry. I sit and look (half-heartedly) for a job online for the next two years. Good thing I have a steady job right now or I'd long since have had many bad things happen. I don't get paid much, but it is enough to maintain my lazy lifestyle of surfing the web, watching TV, trying to eat right and stay in the good shape that I'm in, and of course, there's that "of course" again, working at a job that has a tendency of crushing any vestige of happiness I have after the first two hours of an eight hour shift.  If only I had taken Japanese or something cool in high school, I would be in college now. No, I would just be graduating college now if I were doing a four year bachelor's of computer science. I'd have a semi-bright future, or at least a lustrous appearance of a future that college graduates have. It may only turn out to be a the brilliant fake of a rhinestone, but at least it "looks" like something.  I worry about my future a lot now that I'm on a deadline for leaving the parent's place. Less than a year. I promised that I would probably be gone by 2005, so I have to find a job that will support me having real bills by then. Yet I'm still lazy...  It's not that I couldn't get a job as a software engineer. I have no professional experience, but I TEACH professionals with decades of experience how to program. I've corrected professors with PhD's in computer science on technical topics. I know more about C than most active programmers these days. And yet I find myself sitting at my mother's house, typing a blog because I'm lazy. I could be finishing my book. I could be interviewing for jobs. I could be getting a diet coke from the refrigerator...  There, wasn't that productive? Diet Coke with Lime. The lime flavor almost hides the nasty taste of the diet coke. But I can't drink real coke because the sugar would make me fat. I drink too much soda to risk that because I fear being fat.  Well, it seems like the angst is coming back. I can tell because I'm getting bored. Earlier I had plenty of questions to answer on some of the programming message boards I frequent and the whole program-is-working happiness mixed with hair gel euphoria. But now it's slowing down. It's Thursday too, no good web comics update on Thursday. Pity.  And there's probably nothing on TV either. And I have to work t
