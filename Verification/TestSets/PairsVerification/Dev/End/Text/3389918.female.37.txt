be 49 years old when he is 18... Will I be too old to start my *real* life then????
Why can't I just learn to say no!? Last night at work, a guy came in I hadn't seen in a while. We... Well, for lack of a better term, were "fuck buddies" when I was in high school. He was with another woman, but while she was busy at the counter, he came back and talked to me...Flirting, hinting at things that we had done "back then", and asked for my phone number and email... And I gave it to him!  I know for a fact that he is not interested in what I am looking for... I want a real relationship, I want someone that respects me, cares about me. He just wants someone to "play" with... I KNOW THAT, so WHY did I not just say no??!?  When I married my husband, I loved him. But I also had, in the back of my mind, the thought that no one else would ever ask me to marry him, so I'd better say yes. That recording seems to be still playing in my head, as if I should feel grateful to any man who shows the least bit of attention to me. I know that is what I am doing, yet when the man is standing there I don't think about it... I don't say no... I simply grab onto the attention like a woman overboard grabbing a flotation device.&nbsp; I get so mad at myself sometimes... I seem to be scared to say no...  &nbsp; I have been doing the same thing with another man, Stuart. All he is looking for is a good time... But I tell him, oh yeah, I'll call.... Instead of just telling him that we want different things, and a "roll in the hay" is not what I want...  Someday, somehow, this has got to change... But IM not sure how to get there...
I have a habit of constantly heading down dead-end roads, that I KNOW are dead ends. Not real roads, but life's roads... I usually ONLY am attracted to older men. I have never really been attracted to younger men. BUT... I have a friend that is 10 years younger than me that I am VERY attracted to. Not a bad thing in and of itself, BUT he has a girlfriend. A pretty permanent one.  Why do I always fall for the ones I can't have? Girlfriends, wives... Every man I find myself being attracted to is already attached... Isn't there some psychological reasoning behind that??  Maybe it's just that what they say is true... All the good ones are taken... I don't know, but it drives me crazy... And HE drives me crazy... And it doesn't help that he is an incessant flirt, that just makes me feel worse... **NOTE TO GUYS: If you are otherwise attached, please don't be a tease! If you are not happy in your relationship, get out of it, THEN you can flirt... It's not fair o
