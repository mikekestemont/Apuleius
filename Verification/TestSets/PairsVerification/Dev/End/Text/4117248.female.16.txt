fast. I said it before and I'll say it again: Work sucks!... but it pays the bills!;)
A few nights ago my family rented a couple of movies to watch together. They were: "Along Came Polly", "The Secret Window" and "50 First Dates". They were all okay, but I only really liked one; "50 First Dates" with Drew Berrymore and Adam Sandler. Now, normally any movie with Adam Sandler is pretty useless, funny as heck, but containing no real moral or value. This movie, however, was brilliant. Though it still had some crude humor, and unnecessary sexual innuendo's, the moral and ending were beautiful. The story line is a player (Adam) who gets with tourists as weekend flings, meets a beautiful, charming girl (Drew) and falls in love with her right away. The next day, he tries to sit with her at breakfast, she seems not to recognize him, and finds him to be frightening. After finding out that she has no short term memory, Adam begins to meet her every day, for the "50 First Dates" and gets her to fall in love with him every 50 times. He makes a video for her to watch every morning, so she knows that she loves him, and the story ends with them being married with a child, her still not remembering. The reason I loved this movie so much was because the moral is: true, real love, is waking up every morning, with a fresh start, and falling in love again and again, over and over, forever and ever. That is what I want out of my life, my marriage-when I have one. So, I have to choose the right guy to make me fall in love with him every day. Here are just some things I would look for in this man: *He loves me completely*
"My Dearest Love, I want you to know that I believe in you. I believe that you have what it takes to make your dreams come true, and I just want you to know that I'll be there beside you through both the good times and the bad times. I 'll be your light and warmth when the road gets rough. I'll lend you a shoulder; I'll hold your hand when you hesitate. I know you can make it. Never stop trying! You never know what you can achieve or where your dreams will take you! I love you!" That was an e-mail I got once from a friend, and I wanted to always remember those words. When I replied to that e-mail she told me that she hadn't written it, but it had captured everything she felt, so I sent it to my sisters, and it's a chain reaction, because I found a note Cheyanne had written to her friend, which had the same message on it. When I think about it, it's exactly what our heavenly father would say to us, if we would just listen long or hard enough. My goal is to share these words and listen to the words of G
