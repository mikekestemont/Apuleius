why I am telling any of you this.  My birthday is in 16 days!  Yay me.  My party is in 14.  I have yet to let anyone but Liz, Dan and Steve know.  I bet I'm going to inconvenience a bunch of people because I procrastinate to the extreme, but it doesn't bother me in the least.  I spent the whole day with Caitlin today, and it turned out to be quite fun.  We walked down the street to Rite-Aid and I bought some lipgloss for me and something for her because I felt bad because she hadn't brought any money.  Then my daddy yelled at me because it was his money in the first place.  That's OK, it was to be expected, and after the initial anger he calmed down quickly, and hasn't mentioned it since.  I suppose I'm going to spend the rest of me nights until the end of summer across the street from my house at the baseball fields, because North Utica Raiders Cheerleading officially began today, and though I'm now too old for Pop Warner Cheerleading, I'll go watch them unless I have something more important to do.  Doubtful.  Not much happens with me during the summer.  I saw two movies at the Marquee yesterday.  The first one, The Village, I saw with Emily, Gabe and Sarah Crill.  Some of Gabe's friends were there too, but I didn't really talk to them.  It wasn't good at all.  If I had known it would be anything like it turned out to be, I wouldn't have wasted my 5 dollars.  After that, I saw I, Robot with Steven.  That was much better, but I really can't be a good judge.  I was most likely comparing it to what I just saw, and any movie is incredible compared to that.  The robots in the movie were adorable, though.  LOL, I know, I'm strange.  Don't remind me, Liz does it often enough.  I really need to do my summer reading.  I haven't even gotten the second book yet.  Sigh.  I don't want to.  Don't make me!  Alright, if you insist.  Tomorrow!  Anyone who reads this, IM me at Lilglitturgurl tomorrow (August 2nd) and tell me to do my summer reading.  Maybe if I get bombarded with IMs, I will be inspired to accomplish something.  Dan's going to Enchanted Forest tomorrow.  I wish my mom would take me, but she says she would injure her neck further.  I'm having an interesting conversation with Dan right now, if you all would like to know.  I do believe he is finding it hard to figure out what to say...he keeps starting to type and then stopping.  I would just like to take this moment to say hello to Em, are you out there somewhere in cyberspace Em?  This is a shoutout to you, thanks for always being there for me!  I don't know why I just did that.  I hope it made Em happy.  Well I must go to sleep now, everyone.  Maybe I will post again tomorrow, don't count on it.  B
