be cheerful and smiling all the time, but I don't know is that the "real" me or is that just a mask of my own. I missed those times with "him", my friends. I seemed to have lose the courage to take a further step into my next stage in life because I fear of failure.  I wanted to give in my best effort in everyone, in everything I do, but it seemed rather difficult for me. The more I give, the more I would lose.
Today is my 5th day in poly... Things were not as bad as I had expected and I started to like my new life in poly. My first week in poly was smooth sailing and I pray hard that my next 3 years would be easy for me.  I missed my secondary pals, sharon, kelly, junjie etc... I missed "him" too.. I missed the 4 years in Springfield Secondary and I missed the times my friends and I shared. I felt sad when I had to leave my friends and start my new stage in life without anyone of them near me.

JF was a friend whom I trusted the most and because of that, I was deeply hurt when he broke his promise. A promise which changed my life for more than a yr and perhaps, for the following years too.  My friends said I should let go and start life anew. So do I, and I was hoping and looking forward to start anew with someone else some day. But before that day come, I would still remember "him", a friend who had left deepest memories in my life for the past few years. I don't hate him because he never asked me to like him. I was giving myself forlorn hopes since the starting of our f
