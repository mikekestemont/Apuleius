writing it, but the possibilities of this medium are huge.  So many people, so many views, so many thoughts to search through.  I wish that there was more truth out there in these blogs.  That is going to be my omniresolution, to put truth on this site.  Sorry when I fail, but please be open, and take the time to check back every so often.  I think it may be worth your while.   A blog is an interesting thing.
Rene Descartes wrote, "Cognito, ergo sum", I think therefore I am.  That is the basis of all he knew.  He didn't even really know that though.  The statement is based on logic, "p->q".  It assumes that if "p" is true then "q" is true.  I question the "->", "ergo", "then".  You can only depend on them if logic is true, if reason is true.  I have not encountered any "reason" in my life why I could depend solely on reason.  I have never encountered anything to make me put perfect trust in anyone's logical "therefore"s, "thus"s, or "in conclusion"s.  There is only one way to gain true knowledge.  James 1:5  If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him .  Alma 22:18 of the Book of Mormon gives the perfect example of how to ask.  "... if there is a God, and if thou art God, wilt thou make thyself known unto me, and I will give away all my sins to know thee...".  It is a conditional statement.  It claims no knowledge, it claims no basis,  it denies nothing, it accepts the possibility of everything, it claims nothing.  It consists of only hope.  Hope, and a willingness to act upon the knowledge once it is recieved.     A few weeks ago we were having a discussion in Mr. Mastrota's class.  (It was a great thing on his part to have discussions).  We were talking about the Middle East, and after playing his proper role as mediator and neutral teacher, he did the proper thing and stated his own personal opinion, letting us know full well it was his opinion.  He stated that there was no way to know what happens after death.  That is wrong.  I raised my hand, he called on me, and I said that I knew what happens after death.  Sean Parlia, , a great guy, sitting on the opposite side of the classroom, asked me how can I know.  In class discussions I have limited myself to using reason and not overtly preaching my faith, so I raised a copy of the Book of Mormon that was sitting on my desk and said that the answer was in here; implying that if anyone wanted to know  I have the answer  but that I wouldn't discuss it in class, which in our society is a secular area for secular discussions. The most interesting part of the story is, no one asked.  I claimed to have pure truth, and no one asked for i
