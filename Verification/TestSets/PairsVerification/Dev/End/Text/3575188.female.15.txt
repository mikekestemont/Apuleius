the same time that all of this is going on Ron finds out that his sister Ginny is seeing someone hat Ron doesn't like very much but the only reason that he doesn't like him is because he knows Ginny is dating him. Ron is a very protective person and he doesn't want his younger sister dating at such a young age. i told you that it wouldn't seem very interesting to you because you haven't read the entire book. Truthfully I haven't either. HA HA HA HA HA! Anywayz that wasnt suposed to be funny just for your FYI. I really recomend that you read all 5 harry Potter books if you haven't already. I don't think that you should see the movie until you have read the book. The book gives you alot more detail and the movie cuts out like about half of the book. Anyway check back later for up dates on how the book is. BYE!
Finally the stupid reading class that I am in is almost over. I can sleep in during the days like I am supposed to be doing during summer vacation. Anyway. I have absolutely no idea what I am going to be doing for the next 4 weeks until school starts again.
Thsi is the best time in my life. I wish I am stuck in a computer lab with a bunch of people that half of them I don't even much like. Anyway. I actually can literaly write whatever and about whoever I want and I won't get into any trouble do to the fact that my teacher won' tsee this thing. I have my 100% privacy. Ok let me see. Later on today I am going to write in here a story that I wrote a long time ago. My friends told me that it was a really creepy story. Maybe you will think so too. Right now I am going through alot in my life and I feel like there is no one that I can talk to. Now I can talk to you because I know that I can trust you. Who are you gonna tell ain't no boby know the email address/webaddress what ever. Look. I am going trough a rough time because my grandmother died and I was really close to her. I mean I new that she was going to die sonner or later but I thought that it would be later not sooner. She had cancer but I never thought that I would actually lose her ya know. I know this is probably very stupid. But when she died like a part of me died with her. And then I have the fact that she died on New Years day. At 3:30 in the morning. It is probably really stupid more me to care but I was really close tho my grandmother. You wanna know something really weird. At least I thought that it was, When my mother was 14 her father died and when I was 14 my grandmother died. Talk to ya t
