and Greg was there. Guess who was at the pulpit? President Bush. I have no idea what he was doing there.  Anyway, the Whose Line crew and I do a bunch of Hoedowns while my dad and Greg just watch. But they're not origional Hoedowns. They're all Hoedowns that I have saved on my laptop and have memorized due to repeated listening sessions. Wayne takes the first verse, I do the second, Colin the third, and Ryan the fourth. However, I'm so excited that I always accidentally do Colin's along with mine.  Just as we've done so many Hoedowns that I'm about to go nuts, we start an Irish Drinking song. My dad and Greg join us. However, as anybody who's watched Whose Line should know, due to the music, you can't do an Irish Drinking song with six people. So what we do is that we're all sitting down and anybody that has an idea for the next line just stands up, blurts it out, then quickly sits down again and lets the next person go. Again, its an Irish Drinking song that I have downloaded and memorized. The only odd thing is that when it gets to the very last line, I stand up and say a different line than the one I have downloaded.  Isn't that the oddest dream? And I remember it so vividly too.
