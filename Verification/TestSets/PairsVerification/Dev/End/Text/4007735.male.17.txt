August 13th - August 22nd!!!      OH HELL YES!
Had such an awesome, kickass day at 6 flags today with britt,vicka,jay, and Victoryflet! Yea Victoryflet aka Fletty aka Eric is a kid me and Vicka met through the clan we're in and whom we play with in CS. He's totally cool and it was awesome to meet him! Got a little sick by the end of the night after riding every single roller coaster like 5 times each. Superman = the best roller coaster in new england. such a rush! but yea, we spent literally ALL day and night there! we got there at 1030 am and left at 1030 pm! We did all the crazy rides first, basically the coasters, then we left the park and got some pizza, then came back and did the waterpark for a good 2-3 hours and that was mad fun cuz it was soo goddamn hot out! then we went back to the rollercoasters and whatnot. it was such a great day! 6 flags owns! i'm ready to pass out now and i have work tomoro which bites but its at 1130 so thats better than anything earlier rite? rite. Orange carnival begins tomoro so thats cool too. i'll prolly goto the movies with morgan seeing as the other night wen we attempted to attend said event, i got us really lost to say the least, not gunna even attempt to explain HOW lost i got us but lets just say, i was ashamed at my navigations skills that nite. so yea, prolly do like a matinee after work so that should be good. see morgan is totally kickass and chill and i think she mite have a crush on me? she asked me one time if i'd ever hook up with her or date her. now morgan is a great girl but 1) i know and play hockey with her brother, and dating the younger sister of ANYBODY you're friends with is just plain wrong, it'd be like if one of my friends dated mariel. thatd be fucking fucked up! and 2) she's just not somebody i'd ever do that with. and so i told her these things and she was fine with it. and so i think we've begun a really good friendship and thats always a good thing. what's funny about this situation is that i'm better friends with morgan than i am with chris. but hey, what does it matter? alright, i'm done for the night cuz im tired as hell. lates.   -B
RAWRRRRRRR!!
The day is done I'm on my back, staring up at the ceiling,  i take a drink, sit back, relax, smoke my mind, make me feel better for a small time .
