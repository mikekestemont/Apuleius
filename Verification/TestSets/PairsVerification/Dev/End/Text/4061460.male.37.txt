the impression that if she had to discipline you for some reason, she could really lay the lumber.
I went into school today, and Ms. Randall told me that I will be losing one of my TP 12 classes during second semester and picking up a CP 3 class instead. This probably doesn't sound like a big deal at all, but sometimes I feel like I get crapped on a lot. I'm the only teacher in the history of the school that has been devoid of a classroom for two consecutive years. When choosing our preferences for planning periods, all I asked for was "not 2nd block." I ended up with 2nd period planning both semesters. None of it alone is any big deal, but I sometimes wonder why I alone am expected to make these sacrifices. Why couldn't I sacrifice a little here and someone else sacrifice a little there so that none of us are entirely burdened. Some teachers feel they are already sacrificing a lot by allowing a teacher to float into their room, and I can understand how they would feel that is an inconvenience, but I think I would be pretty happy to change positions with them. I also know there are some teachers who are sacrificing nothing.  There's no use grumbling and groaning about it though. It's much better to focus on how good I have it than how poor some things seem to be. Still, it's nice to vent a little bit, and this seems like a reasonably safe place to do so.
The kids had their lists of school supplies, and I had a lot of materials that I needed, so Cindy and I packed up the crew and headed to Staples. I know it is dorky, but I get a big charge out of new school supplies. I ended up creating six seperate "kits" of supplies for group work. I also ended up with a new stapler (works like a staple gun), tape dispenser, paper clip holders, folders, and stuff I may never need.  Jack went and got his hair cut. He got the "Caeser," and he looks very sharp. I kind of had to talk him into it, but he loves it now.  Next, we all went and got shoes. I got two pair of dress shoes - one brown, one black. They are quite comfortable and looks nice also - not too dressy, but not casual.  We couldn't decide whether we were going to have lunch next or just have ice cream. Of course we settled the matter by having both. We're Americans. Thats' what we do. Any guesses as to why I am forty pounds overweight?  Church today was nice, but tonight's Bible study was a bit boring. I hate when instructors just prattle on for endless minutes and then ask, "Well, what do you guys think?" By that point no one is in conversation mood, so we all just sit there and stare, which the instructor feels is his indicator to keep talking. Students, stop me when/if I do t
