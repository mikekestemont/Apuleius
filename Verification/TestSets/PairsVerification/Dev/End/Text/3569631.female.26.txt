pages some other time... Hopefully tomorrow with happy news!
Ohhh!! It seems i always have need to write when i am down. And i am so down today!!  I've seen new mothers yesterday at one party. And new born babies.. And i saw how mothers behave.. And it brought me to conclusion that God is not our mother.. It's been three years since i am prisoner of one relationship from which i cant get out. I feel it most of the time as a punishment for something really bad i did in some past life or something.. I mean this person is drinking my blood as a vampire!! And i dont know how to get out! I should be studying now because i have billions of exams to give.. but i am just too down to move.. no light or air in my mind...  I need a miracle to set myself free... and i need to be free from all this if i want to survive...

And my duties; well they consist of studing, and trying to earn money to survive, and housework, and also i am trying to do some exercises and meditation.. And guess what!!! So many days pass that i dont managed to do not one of those things!!!  And then when exam days approach i kill myself in studing in last few days, and my brain cracks... and i feel lifeless few days after that.. Now are those days... And then i am thinking how to repair myself!! How??? Well it seems that i am asking so many questions on this blog! Me, who always knows the right answers when others are concerned.. Ahhh!! Yeah, i am really m
