that because we don't have equality YET. Women don't get paid the same as men (unless they're union and that is a socialist organization anyway). People of color don't get the same treatment and opportunities as white men. You cross the street to avoid confrontation with teen age black kids, don't you? Well don't you? You know that you, yourself, practice the self same acts that tell the other people on the planet that they're not part of YOUR world and aren't as good as YOU are all the time. And if you don't think so then you either aren't paying attention or you're really good at lying to yourself so that you can preserve the air of entitlement about your place in life being what it is because you're SO smart, SO good, SO kind, SO deserving, SO the member of the right religion, SO well bred, SO well mannere. SO FULL OF SHIT.  Wow, that went somewhere I didn't plan on.  Where was I?   OH yeah. Give Iraq some time. IF they want to change they'll do so. Yep, prodding is good, showing is good, examples are good. No not the kind where we torture them in prisions, but the other kind.  Patience. The thing we need to practice is patience. That sure self knowledge that I didn't get where I am over night and I shouldn't expect it of you.   Try it, for just a day.
Had our first meeting of the upper level of the San Luis Valley regional coordinators for Mike Miles for Senate. See the longer your title the more important you are. We laid out some preliminary plans and geared up for when we get the info we're waiting for to make the contacts we need to make to hopefully get Mikes name in the forefront of folks minds as the August 10 primary draws close.  It was kinda funny though. As we were making plans at the local DQ things just kept falling for other folks to do. Crys is in charge of Data and the administration and prioritizing of how it flows and what flows from it. Bennie is in charge of keeping the democratic party honest during the primary. She's also gonna get us some applications for local fests and fairs. Of course at one point they looked at me and asked, "What are YOU going to do"?   Dang, no slipping under the wire with those two!   I do have jobs. I've been emailing to get info and stuff sent down. I'm starting to contact folks in some of the counties to get volunteers for each county to do the same things we're doing but at a more micro level.   So interesting to read Derbs last post. Sure does make me curious
so, i've been kinda of quiet here lately.  all i can can really contribute is that i have updated my voter registration and well, who i'll vote for in november might surprise you.  i know you'll be on the edge of your seats until then..ya might even pee your pants. l
