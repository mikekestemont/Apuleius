call it a night.    Back to the cabin and off to an early night of bed.      Saturday   I woke up really early and started making breakfast for the 9 of  us that were at the cabin. Uncle woke up and started to help after awhile. At 11 I got my bathing suit on and my cousin and his friends drove out to the island in the middle of my lake for the Island Swim Race. The island is just over a mile from the beach. We had to get dropped off at the island and swim back to the beach. This year there were 6 of us doing it (I have done it 3 times before).  The person who won it did it in 20 mins. All I can say about that is WHAT A CRAZY NUT. I did it in 46 mins which gave me 3rd place.  After the race we took the boat back to the cabin and then went to play in the horseshoes tournament. I proceeded to throw tons of ringers and leaners but still managed to lose in the 2nd round by sheer luck for the other team. We threw a winning leaner but they threw a ringer over top and took it by 1 point. Oh well there is always next year.       Sunday   OH MY GOSH my body hurt!   Very little accomplished today. Spotted my cousins waterskiing and tubing in the neighbours Mastercraft. What a nice boat! My cousin's friend who i'm not particularily fond of went on the tube and nearly got killed but he held on...?!?! how?!?!      Monday   I can feel a cold coming on I still ache my leg hurts from tripping over the pullout bed last night. My sister and uncle are going home tonight in my car. Auntie Debbie,my little cousin Brandon and I went to Rainbow Falls. People were jumping off these falls into the water lower down.... I decided i wasn't going to jump instead I would go to the lower part and swim around...next thing i know i'm being pushed down the river and actually having a hard time stopping. Kept bumping parts of my body of the rough rocks hidden below. Why do people think this is fun?!So now i'm still aching from the island swim race, tripping and bruising my leg on the bed but now i'm bumped and bruised from these damn rocks. Debbie, Brandon and I went out for dinner at a local restaurant cause we couldn't be bothered to cook.       Tuesday   Well its official I'm dead to the world.    I'm so sick I can't get up I ache all over, I have a cold of some sorts, someone must have run over my head with their car or something. All I can do is sleep. Well what a weekend at least I won a trophy and got to go swimming. It was all worth it in the end but seriously if I find the person who gave me this cold I'll get even. I have a slight suspicion it was my u
