the brownies were completely uneven. haha well we discovered that when we took them out of the oven. so while these brownies are cooking jess and i go into the living room to eat our delicious mix and watchin EVIL KENEVIL! lol and it had a very stupid ending so we were dissapointed. then the real brownies were done but we didnt eat those. only little alyssa had a bite and decided she didnt want it anymore, then she fell alseep. aw she is so cute. then jessica and i rented a movie called "monster" which is bout a hooker who gets raped one time when she is screwing this guy and then shes kills him adn then she meets this girl and they make out and are kinda like lesbians but im not sure really and then this hooker who is charlese tharone who is usally wicked petty kills every guy she gets to have sex with her, but she doesnt really hae sex with them bc she learned her lesson, so she just kills them and stel their money. so in one scene the two girls are making out and jessica goes "eww this is like a scary movie. HIDE!" so her mother and i start laughing bc we think this is extremely funny, which it wa.so the jess an i went upstairs to put our pj's on or maybe itwas before we watched the scary movie haha but we went upstair either way and watched bring it on, always a funny movie and jessica decided she waned popcore, but she didnt have any, so i said we should go eat out frosting and we did..then we fell asleep adn i awoke to alyssa putting things in my face and jess's dg buddy stting on me. so then we woke up, got dresssed, ate english muffins (jessica cant put butter on them so i did it for her) and then we wnt to the mall with her b/f chris. and then chris bliss met up with us and i was pissed bc he is truely the one person on this planet that i cant fucking stand.  but oh well. jess and i wante to go into GAP so we did and they left us so we spent the remainder of the day tryong to find them. oh yea we bought chris an afro pick bc he had a fro. he was kinda mad but we thought it was funny. oh yea and jess had this coffee thing and she got it on he shirt so we had to get her a new one which took forever and then she ought a see thru one so she took my tank top and i really needed that tank top so i had to buy a new one and jess bought another coffee and got that on her shirt too! then we went back to her house and watching t.v until my mom came to get me. the end. i love jessica frey and chris is cool too. hes a good k
