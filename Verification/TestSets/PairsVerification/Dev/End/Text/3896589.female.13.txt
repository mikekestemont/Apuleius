Xue Kun pointed out a mistake, so I had to deduct a point, go up to Mrs Ngain to mark corrections. Then Xue Kun pointed out another mistake, so I had to deduct another mark. Then I had to go up to Mrs Ngain again, and said, "I found another one,"         AND THEN MRS NGAIN DID THE CRUELEST THING!!! SHE SAID, "Oh, then I have to remove your sticker," She said with a smile. THEN SHE CAREFULLY PEELED MY STICKER OFF MY PAGE!!!! AAHHHH!!!!!!!!!         I GOT BACK AND STRANGLED XUE KUN, POINTING TO HER AND SCREAMING, "ALL BCAUSE OF YOU!!! I LOST MY STICKER!!! YOU TOOK AWAY MY STICKER!!!"         But it was all said in laughs, smiles and fun, so no-one died. :)

A few days ago, my brother received a letter for the gifted program. Of course, I told him to join. But he was still wavering. I talked to him some more. I'm sure he was shouting YES inside his head but was too shy. I KNOW. Haha. : )         Then my mom said that the Old Goat (of course she didn't say 'old goat' she said  yang yang's  older   brother) was also in the gifted program, and now he's in a gifted school. I was like, What?! I didn't even know that!!          I didn't expect someone like him to get into a gifted school, he never told me that, seeing as we don't talk much. I do like his younger sister(3 yrs old maybe?) though. I play and TRY to talk with her a lot, but I don't hear much of her talking. She DOES talk, but it's just gabble. : )         His younger brother(4 or 5 yrs old) Noah is also entertaining to watch. He can also talk, but sometimes it's rubbish, and most of my cousins get irritated, especially the older guys. But the even older girls think it's cute.         Y'know, it's not fair that I'm stuck with a whole bunch of guys around my age in the cousin lineup. The girl cousins are either too old or young to "hang out" with. I mean, my fave girl cousin Jessie(she's VERY cool) is 17 this year! That's the closest girl age to mine. Then I have this baby cousin, Joleen. She's quite boring sometimes.         And one time, I heard some guy voices shouting, so I went to check it out. The Old Goat (it's his nickname, the guys call him that) was shouting at Zhao Xing (my older cousin). He made Phyllan cry (Old Goat's OTHER younger bro), and was shouting at Zhao Xing. Seriously, Phyllan is the same age as me, and STILL needs his older brother to fight his battles?         I know MANY girls who are at least 5 times tougher than him. C, for example.            Please Note: The Old Goat is not my cousin. Care to guess what relationship he has with my family? 50 cents will be given to the winner!! H
