. Simple design. It took me a total of 4 hours to do the WHOLE thing! Half of that time was looking for a host. I got a new bike too! A good one! It looks awesome, and rides good too. Me and my rents went over to Sport Mart last night. I really like that place. I bought all my back-to-school clothes there. Plus, they know us now. I really liked this pair of pants, exept they where $69.99. I asked him if he was serious, and he said maybe he can lower the price $20 under there "clearance policy". So he did. I probably have spent $500 dollars there now. Everybody, if you live near a Sport Mart, or Sport Check, GO THERE NOW!!!  5 days until I leave for Florida. Better bring my raincoat! Mike
Yeesh. I stayed up until 1:30 last night on Proboards Support. I got up at 9:30 that morning. A 16 hour day! Veryt tired, but I am already creating my 2nd website (aside from XNews). I think it is going to be a blog, that everybody can use, much like Blogger.  But I have some good ideas that is going to separate it from all the others. Only 1 more week until I go to Florida! Sun, Sand, and well, and PS2! I might be going and getting a bike tonight. The last new bike I got was when I was 6. Sad almost. I am currently download 10.8 MB worth of blogging software, so I expect to be on the interent most of the day. Yipee! I'll keep you posted.  Mike
Great, just lovely! This is all that I need, honestly. 38 wonderful new messages, fan mail I hope. LOL. Well, Admin Central is gone, out of my power! I gave up the position of head admin on Saturday. I needed some time away, plus, I am creating my new website, XNews:  urlLink http://xnews.000k2.com/phpnuke/index.php . I'm hoping that it can be finished by the time I go to Florida. If anyone wants to contribute, you can read the first message on the main page!  Anyways, I was going to say something.....I forgot. Damnit. Well, farewell for now!  ..::``Mike``::..
Well, I finished the LIT Program, and had a fun, enjoyable time, and met some totally awesome people. I am probably going to take LIT 2 in the fall, so I can become a leader for the city next summer. Among other things I am now persuing is a soccer referee for the Byron Optimistr Club, and a speaker/presenter for Pillar. For Pillar, I would go around to different schools and show them a presentation on how to become a volunteer! Exciting stuff! I now have 2 weeks to relax, and then we are going to Florida for the last 2 weeks of summer! Go get a tan, and look for some t-shirts are my goal. I finished shopping for clothes last weekend. I got these awesome shoes, and some cool pants ($69.99 mind you). So, I've been happy lately, and thats all that matters!  Mike :
