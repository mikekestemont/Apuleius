We're Back!! Who Missed Us? Everyone else is probably on vacation as well. This is Taylor posting for the us blog. School's almost back. I'm actually kind of excited. It might be fun. We shall see...  First of all and most important, I had a great time in Canada. Spending 7 days with Sarah, in CANADA, not in TEXAS, was absolutely perfect! It was just unreal. Amazing. Thank you Sarah for such a great time. I loved Bobcaygeon, your home, your boat, everything. Thank you. I don't like the heat here. Its way too damn hot in Texas right now. Oh well.  Sarah's leaving in a month and a half. It will be very sad yes, but I am so excited for her. We've promised each other we'd have an awesome time apart. I am excited to see her grow as an individual and she is very excited to see me grow as well.  I'm really tired and I might go take a nap in a few minutes. We shall see.  I'm running Spybot right now because something took over my computer while I was gone. Its so annoying. Oh! I'm getting a new computer. Very excited about it. As my birthday present. Woot.  I'll post more later =
