but i was too busy sending out jams to shut people up.  i did take a thirty minute break in there somewhere to run outside in the middle of hurricane charlie and dive in the pool and let it know i wont go without a fight. the door back inside soon shattered and made me walk across glass which surprisingly hurt nothing. even my feet. there was an amazing amount of luck tonight. LUCK damnit. Not what you think. You shut that religious speak up.   at this moment. its only 2am and everyone has went home or passed out. my makeshift room is being occupied by two girls who i was told i was too gay to attract. special. considering i never considered myself gay. perhaps its the clean and thin thing. or maybe the making out with guys thing. but for christ's sake thats only when especially drunk and people look to me for guidance. then i like to shock them before giving them advice.   oh i'm an idiot. please everyone, just ignore this stupid fucking blog as you have been for so many weeks. i will be back in that damn city soon with my screenplay cash and i will totally let that place have it. toodles. here i come.
okay so, now that that is out of the way... can someone please dear lord explain to me what would compell a backstreet boy to strike another human? especially a girl. boys should not hit them. in fact, backstreet boys should be forced to stay far away from them. ah fuck it.  yesterday was my birthday and surprise, surprise i didn't get blitzed like a fucking high school quarterback. instead i found myself on a go-kart track in maitland, fl skidding out of control. this is not where i saw myself on my 24th birthday. then again, i never really saw myself as a screenwriter either and that happened. i gotta get back to new york or michigan soon. at some point last night i found myself scowering my goddamn phone book trying to find  urlLink emily haines  telephone number so that i could alert her to my desire of wanting to make about fifteen hundred babies with her.  then i realized that it wasn't going to happen because i never met her and therefore did not have her number. i called other friends in other rock bands, and then realized that i had taken too many shots of something and stopped before i got to that blitzed level and spent the rest of night storyboarding with a drunken member of  urlLink small brown bike  who was only wearing a pair of sweapants that were rolled  down .  sexy?  oh hell. its late and i need to go listen to the new  urlLink pinback  album "summer in abaddon" about five more times before i pass out. drawing is not fun. unless you're drawing privates onto subway posters of catwomen.  goodnight you no people who read this. i love you all. thank you for giving me an outlet to vent b
