that's a hugs slap in the face for MS (or it should be).    also in the article: "Mac users are not in danger." i luff my ibook :)  choosing better software only makes sense.  unfortunately for the majority of PC users, Microsoft products aren't better, and many don't know there's a better option.  the more articles that can bring alternatives to light, the better.
it's the summer.  who wants to think about school?  not me!  especially since i won't be coming back!  nevertheless, i'm gonna keep posting here, because some of my former g33ks might still glance here every so often. it's all good :)  a couple of things have changed.  first, i picked a new design--still hooper colors, but there are some differences.  for one, the profile you see on the right is mine...same thing you'll see  urlLink on my homepage .  it's much smotther than the old blogger system.  second, if you look at the bottom of this post you'll see a link for Comments.  yes, you can comment on posts!  it's interactive and stuff.  me being the authoritarian i am, though, i control all comments.  if it's juvenile, it's deleted.  if it's a problem to use them, i disable it and require membership to post comments.  simple enough :)  have a good summer, and happy hacking
actually, it's not me... urlLink it's my picture at art.gnome.org !  i made this using  urlLink the gimp , and submitted it to the site.  as of today, if you  urlLink sort the GNOME backgrounds by popularity , i'm in second place!  which is great, because the  urlLink picture that's in the number one spot  is awesome...i'm actually using it as by desktop at home :) i need to gimp up some more pictures! it's pretty sweet to see people enjoying what you've made    what's really cool is, there were a couple of students (and one in particular) who enjoyed using the gimp so much that it inspired me to make this picture.  keep hacking, guys...and if you get the urge, slap a GNOME logo on it and submit it to  urlLink art.gnome.org.   it would be cool to see your names on there!
wow.  i just found out that someone actually reads this still!  w00t!  so i came back to the blog, only to realize it's all out of date, and some of the settings weren't right.  so...i'm fixing it :)  also, i got my own domain name ( urlLink www.jkrewe.com .  and just so you know,  urlLink my blog  is where all the updates are happening.  but in the future (especially when school time rolls around again), i'll try to keep an eye on this and see how it's going ;)  thanks to my loyal, umm, reader(s) :)  inspiration is a good thing
if you are still languishing under the weight of the Big Blue E,  urlLink you may want to patch that sucker up .  MS has broken their monthly patch cycle to release three patches that repair 'ctitical' flaws in the Internet Exploite^H^H^HExplorer browser...get 'em while they're hot!  or before your box i
