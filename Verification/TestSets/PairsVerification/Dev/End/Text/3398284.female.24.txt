got "Best American Poetry of 2003". I get this and "Best American Short Stories of ____" each year... and I'm never disappointed.  But you know what they say -- never say never. I read the poetry last night and was apalled. Not at the poetry, but at my sheer lack of patience to read an entire poem. It's getting that bad, folks. I tried, but the poems seemed to really suck rocks. I couldn't get into them, almost none of them were about love lost, lover scorned, love unrequited.... and that's the kind of poetry I like. So sca-roo 2003's American Poetry, that's what I say!
Dear Mom and Dad, &nbsp; OK, mom and dad, I finally found a man I can write home about. &nbsp; We met on the beach last year when I was doing my studies for the underwater basket weaving. You know what they say -- when you stop looking you finally find someone! Well, I did! He's great -- he's smart and he's funny and he's got a real keen eye for fashion. &nbsp; I can't wait for him to move to the states from wherever-the-hell-he's-from, so we can start a family and a real life together. Mom, Dad, I think he could be the one! I really think this is the love I've been waiting for! &nbsp; Oh, oh, I almost forgot -- I took a picture of him before I left. I've posted it below. &nbsp; Love you!, --Molly &nbsp; &nbsp;
So my dad called me last night and said he was working on his crossword puzzle -- "What's a four letter name of a Salinger character beginning with E?" I was embarrassed -- couldn't think of it -- so I started digging through my books. Obviously it had to be in Nine Stories. Couldn't find the books, but I found "Winesburg, OH" which I had bought at the Tucson Library Sale for 75 cents.   Turns out the answer was Esme (stupid! stupid! stupid!), but I'm going to start Winesburg, OH tonight, for the second time.
As Terence Trent D'arby says: Welcome to my monastereo.
Pinwheel, Pinwheel, spinning around Look at my pinwheel and see what I've found!  I think it aired on Nickelodeon, theme song music by Jay Lee. First aired April of 1979 (before I was born) Last aired June of 1989.  I may be wrong, I just thought this up out of my head.&nbsp; :)
