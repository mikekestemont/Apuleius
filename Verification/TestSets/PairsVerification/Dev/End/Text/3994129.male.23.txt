Do you think Nickelback are the pinnacle of artistic achievement??  Are you anxiously awaiting the the next "Fiddy" album??  Do you find Pink to be "edgy" and empowering to women??  Did you find the new Justin Timberlake Album "raw"??  Is MTV or the radio your main source of new music??  Does an artist need high-rotation airplay for validation of artistic merit in your eyes??  Do you love "I want to hold your hand" but hate the fact the Beatles had to go and get all "weird" on everybody??  Is Entertainment Weekly a credible source of cultural dissemination and commentary??  Can't wait for the next installment of American Idol??      Do you miss the Spice Girls??    If you answered yes to any of the above questions then, unfortunately, you have bad taste in music. Statistics show that the majority of your mass-media consuming peers also suffer from the same ailment; you are not alone. But don't despair, for there is hope for all victims of this tragic phenomenon in today's popular culture.   urlLink Yes friends, there is salvation for all you media-saturated automatons that pray at the alter of MTV . One needs only to follow  Three  simple steps to cure oneself:  1) Do Not Attend Concerts which showcase bad music  2) Stop Listening to bad music  And most importantly, 3) Turn off your radio and television!!   Friends, this is an epidemic of colossal proportions in today's society. However, we need not stand by idly while millions more fall into the trap of mass media inspired consumer comas. I write this not out of self interest, but out of compassion for my fellow man (and woman). We must take action now!!
