it is becoming an eagerly anticipated event for us.  this would be the last year at this cabin though, as our friend is selling it.  not to worry though, the plans are to find a new one.  anyway, this really is one of the funnest weekends of the year for us but this year when the time came we really didn't have enough money and told our friend that we would have to back out.  word of our backing out got back to another friend who was going as well.  he is not one to call us normally so it was strange to see his number popping up on our phone.  we listened to the messages we had and the one from him was one of the kindest messages i have heard and actually made me a little teary eyed...."you guys have to come to the cabin.  you won't need money.  we just went to the store and bought food for everyone and plenty of beer.  we even have fireworks.  we all really want you up there..."   for some reason the fact that he went out of his way to help us out really floored me.  the friends we have are great, but a lot of them wouldn't ever think of helping out or being there for you  when you need it.  a lot of them would just not think of it.    but it felt really good to have someone say--we like you.  we want you around.  just bring yourselves and we'll do the rest.  you won't need anything else.  just you...
the other day jesse was at a gas station pumping some gas when a guy came up to him, out of nowhere and asks, "so how's your day going?". even jesse, being an outgoing guy himself, was surprised by the man's casualness. he told the man that he was doing well and noticed the man had on a vet's jacket and hat. jesse asked the man if he was a vet and the man said he was. jesse reached out his to shake the man's and told him thank you. the man just kind of nodded his head and walked away, but was obviously touched at jesse's gratitude. i have a couple of friends who serve in the military. uncles who served in vietnam. a neighbor who has just been called to service for up to two years, leaving behind a wife and two kids. and as much as i don't like the military, i have a lot of respect for the people who volunteer themselves to fight for us. and i have a lot of respect for those who had no choice but to fight for us. they have put their lives on the line to ensure certain rights and freedoms for us and others. at this year's 4th of July fireworks, taps was played. the emcee asked us to remember those who have given their lives for this country.  it brought me to tears to think of them... thank you to all you vets and god bless y
