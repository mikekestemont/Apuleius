Just a quick post to keep things bubbling while I work on the turkey frying pictures. Another Park Ave shot, the house across the road has dollar bills glued to the pavement (sidewalk) out front. I've not seen a single person fooled in six months.
The official period of mourning is now over, but everything was still at half-mast on Friday when Courtney and I visited the  urlLink Port of Rochester Ferry Terminal . Everything that looks like a flag, at least. While checking the place out we caught sight of this:     I can  just  about understand a large number of Americans wanting to mourn Ronald Reagan,  urlLink the ketchup-loving ones  especially, but I'm doubtful that Canadians give two hoots that the old fool kicked the bucket.  Then again, the Maple Leaf appears to be flying at somewhat less than half-mast. Perhaps there's some law which dictates that no flag of a foreign nation on US soil is permitted to fly higher than the Stars and Stripes. I wouldn't be surprised.
...that people do to celebrate American Independence Day, this deserves some kind of prize. Courtney's parents have decided to investigate the worrying trend that is sweeping the States: the deep-fried turkey. I am terrified at the prospect. What next? Deep-fried cow?  What's wrong with a nice bit of battered haddock?  Worst thing is, if the turkey isn't properly defrosted the deep fryer will launch it into orbit, or so I'm told. I'll try to get pictures.
During my last visit back to the Shire, Dom noted that I had changed from being plain-and-simple "Liam" to "Porky Liam."

Oh, there are many sad, pallid, bloated excuses I can make for my increasing girth, none of which cut the mustard - or my weight.  Courtney has noticed a similar ballooning around her waistline, which started with my arrival and her switch away from a toast-only diet. Now, with the arrival of summer, and the moderate certainty we'll be able to leave the house without getting snowed on, she has decided we're to start running off the fat. Tonight I expect we'll raid the wardrobe to find a semblance of a jogging outfit for me. I don't do sports clothing, so the results should be interesting, and probably bloggable.  But right now it's time for lunch. A 14" Italian sub sandwich with lettuce, black olives, Swiss cheese, spicy mustard and hot peppers from Wegmans should just about sort me o
