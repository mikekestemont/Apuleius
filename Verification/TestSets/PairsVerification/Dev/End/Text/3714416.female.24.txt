I'm a bit apprehensive about the actual filming- I'm not terribly experienced at the TV/acting thing- actually, I'm completely inexperienced. But I'm sure it will be fine.  I have to wake up early in the morning to buy new shoes, too- I broke one of my heels on stage tonight! It's ridiculous how quickly I go through dancing shoes!
I have an exam in the morning...don't ask why I'm up. I dunno.  The stats for my page are funny- lots of hits, and I don't know how they're finding me! I mean, I've given out the url to, like, 15 people maybe, and I've had 168 unique visitors (2000 some odd non-unique, most probably me checking to see what's working or not :D). Weird.  I have to admit, most of the feedback I've gotten on the site hasn't been very positive. Lots of *shrug* "what's the point?", and "I expected better pictures in the gallery".  . Well, for one, it's not FINISHED yet, and the point? It's been established, there isn't one. If you don't like it you don't have to look. You dig? Sheesh.  There's a private investigation course at Douglas College this fall, I'm considering applying. I've always thought I'd be good at that. Could be fun, I'd want to do low-key stuff like skip-tracing, no bounty hunting or anything.
My big news for today is that I'm going to be an extra on a TV show called the L-word. This was arranged though Stripper (the agency), and I'm happy because it pays quite well. I'm playing the role of 'lapdancer' (of course!). So I guess I'll have to learn how to lapdance now! I will be there on Tuesday and Wenesday next week, which is cool as it adds a little bit of 'different' into the same old same old...  I'm just about gradumatated, two more exams to go...I truly know the meaning of the word bittersweet now! lol, mostly just kidding...though I  will  make sure to look at the job options that are actually available when I get my next degree. (*eye roll*)  Mugs this week...well...it's Mugs. I will not be unhappy when Saturday evening rolls around. I kicked someone! First time, though I'm surprised I haven't done it before...I don't understand the logic of bars placing their poles so close to the edge- I guess so that guys get a 'better look', but that's dumb in many respects. Bums and crotches are ugly close up. It's unhygenic, since so many guys feel the need to eat in gyno row, to have naked pussy near food, and finally it's unsafe- YOU MIGHT GET KICKED! This guy I kicked in the nose with the toe of my shoe going around the pole..he bled a bit, but was very nice and joked about it, totally let me off the hook, Phew. It was a silly accident, I'm usually extremely careful, maybe he moved or maybe my judgement was just off...either way, I'm being even more careful now. Stupid long legs- they're all well and good until somebody loses an eye! ;
