what do you do when a movie comes out that is the ideological child of two of the greatest action/horror franchises of all time?  An idea so strong that it has spawned web sites, comic books, video games, and a whole slew of nerds?  What you do is go see the movie.  There are wo distinct possibilities here.  Possibility one (1) is that the movie rocks.  Unequivicable awesomeness just seeps from its every moment, and this movie is responsible for the nerd population of the world dropping by three-quarters due to so many fanboys dropping like flies from pleasure-induced anuerisms.  Possibility two (2) is that the movie sucks.  And sucks bad.  So insanely bad that it makes God cry.  There is no middleground here where this movie could just be average due to the hype behind it, at least among the fans.  Most normal people probably don't know about it as it hasn't been too terribly advertised, to its credit.  Personally, I hope that it's good, although I expect it to be bad.  First off, I'm not a big action/horror buff, so action movies have to be pretty damn good to impress me.  Second, with the slew of crappy movies which have been coming out lately, ANY good movie is in short supply.  Third, I'm an AVP fan.  I know all the backstory and whatnot behind both the Aliens and Predator franchises.  Here's to hoping.  I'll post my review tomorrow night.
First off, the title is deceiving.  I've been swamped with school, work, and moving.  This is pretty much why I haven't been writing.  Well, that and the forces of evil are directly behind me, waiting to devour my soul the moment I pause for breath.
For those of you who were waiting for Bush's "War on Terra... oops, Terror" to actually produce some RESULTS, like I was, here it is. After three years, Osama Bin Laden has finally been captured.
Look long and hard at me.  Or, my writing.  The semi-true tale which I am to tell shall cause you to compare your paltry fortitude to mine and kill yourself at the knowledge of your inadequacy.  This endeavor makes Project DMAO (Drink My Ass Off) look like a vacation.
What follows is a test to determine whether or not you are a zombie. Please bear in mind that this test is ONLY to determine if you are a zombie, and may not assist you in determining if you are some other type of undead. Though there are few questions, this test is over 150% accurate if answered truthfully.
Both the republicans and democrats are insistent that their horse (Bush and Kerry, respectively) is going to win the race, and by a landslide, at that. I'm going to look at a few possibilities and explain the scenarios and circumstances under which each would happen.
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Security is being stepped up in Washington, New York City and northern New Jersey after "alarming" intelligence from multiple sources indicated that al Qaeda terrorists could be targeting financial institutions with car bombs, Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge said S
