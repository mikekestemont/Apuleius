few of us are going to dinner after work...PF Changs in downtown Sacramento, so I'm looking forward to that, and then on Saturday, a group of us are going to see Spiderman 2, and I'm taking the kids, so another fun day.  I'll review the movie when I get back!  Have a groovy day, Lee
You know, I have really nothing to say, however I figured I would at least let anyone who reads this know I'm still here.  incidentally, I did get my 6th month review, and it was exactly what I thought it would be....AVERAGE.  I ended up getting  a 3.03 out of 5, so actually .03 above average, big whoop-de-fucking-do!  He said he doesn't like to give too high a rating, so that if something happens, it's easier to make a score higher at the year review, than it is to make it lower.....bullshit!  If someone screws up, they expect it, or at least should.  other teams' supervisors gave higher ratings...for no other reason than they like to be loved. So the same will go at the year review where money will come in. The higher the score, the higher the dollar value of the raise.  This review process sucks!  Alright, till next time, have a groovy day, Lee
Just a quick note this morning to say that as my supervisor left last night, he said he would be giving me my review today....  Like I said in my last note, as half of it is based on if he likes me.....I'm screwed!  It's sad really....I think he's jealous that I can do his job better than he can!  Have a groovy day Lee
Hello all,  So today is Monday night, and what is happening since my last posting?  Well, sometime this week I will be getting my 6 month review, and to be honest, I'm not expecting much.  It's not that my numbers are bad....Because they're not. I win the award each month for being in either the top 5% or 10% or the department.  The reason is that 50% of mine, and everyone else's review is based on our "Visions and Values", otherwise known as how big a butt kisser can you be to both managers and customers.  they have categories like "Collaboration" and "putting Members First", all of which I do, however it's not based on factual information or numbers based.  It's based on your supervisor's opinion of you. Therefore as some supervisors are the kind who want to be liked, they can up your numbers. My friend Samantha got her review and got 2.8 out of 5, so below average from my supervisor. Her friend, Tori got her review and got a 3.8, even though she is on a corrective action for attendance.  IT HAS NO FACTUAL BASIS AT ALL.....JUST OPINION  THERE IS NO CONSISTENCY BETWEEN SUPERVISORS  YOUR RAISE IS NOW 50% BASED ON IF SOMEONE LIKES YOU  I don't know if this is even legal, so if anyone knows, please email me.  I'll post my review score when I get it.  Have a groovy week, L
