My husband is berating me for choosing a pink template... ok, maybe berating is a bit harsh. He was just a bit suprised.  Pink has never been my color of choice. In fact it is close to last on the list of color choices. My first experience decorating my own room is likely the reason for my intolerance of pink. I was allowed to choose the paint color for my room as a pre-teen. I choose a light rose color. I disliked it immediately. My grandfather even repainted it a slightly darker shade. I tolerated it but I definitely wasn't crazy about it. I'm glad my parents let me choose the color. It was a live and learn experience and even today choosing paint colors is STILL a live and learn experience. I'm still just as picky about paint colors even in my own home today. The dining room is Cranapple, the baby's room Golden Cricket (a golden green color), the bathroom a Powder Blue... and I'd probably change all of the colors if I had the time. The question of the hour though is how many times would I repaint the room before I was finally satisfied?! I'm guessing it would probably take me 4 tries for each room by the time I arrived at the *perfect* color.   As for the pink in my room as a pre-teen... I always considered myself slightly tomboyish. I loved to climb trees and get dirty. I enjoyed beating the guys in gym class at pushup, pullups and situps. I owe my strength and determination to gymnastics which taught be a lot about perseverance and hard work. I didn't mind the sweat. At any rate, I was anything but a girly-girl. The light rose color of my walls only reinforced this fact. I've since learned that I like bold and and bright, or calm and serene. In my opinion, pink is usually a mush color that is neither bold and bright or calm and serene.   But then of course the shade of pink makes a huge difference. I can tolerate and even like a bold pink. And on my baby girl, I must admit, she looks pretty cute in pink. So really - I don't hate pink... I just don't CARE for pink and specifically, I'm not crazy about pastel "baby" pink.
Stability and cyberspace should never appear in the same sentence. Companies, websites, information, and misinformation come and go faster than the ocean tides... servers change, hardware dies, backups are lost, companies are bought... all in the blink of an eye. As a designer of websites I'm accustomed to this volatility... yet I will never be used to it. I am convinced that somewhere there must exist a cyber abyss where all lost information is filed, dead websites spend eternity, and renamed companies pay penance in purgatory.   Hence my fear with baring my soul on a blog. I must subject my thoughts to the blogging Gods... and pray that my rantings and ravings will be spared from the cyber a
