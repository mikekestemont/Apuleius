last night at Zouk did cut me like a knife. Lightly but surely, I can feel the discomfort. I am not angry anymore, just a little disappointed but it has blown over. I may not be as matured or old as the other, I may not beat the crap out of the party that tries to bring you down or spear words of attack when there wasn't anyone to target on. Neither did I think the matter was grave enough to throw the first punch. I may appear 'chicken shit' or ' ball-less' to you. Personally, I think I'm matured enough not to make a scene in public till its rightfully necessary. I can bleed for you, cry for you and protect you when the time calls for, but not raving like a 15 year old that doesn't have a commendable  composure or a tight head screwed on. If you think the lesser of me, I will not defend myself coz there is no need to. I clearly know who I am and what I am capable of, which is not public embarrassment at least. Please do not get upset after reading this, as writing my blog is one of the few options of emotion outlets I have. Let's try and keep an open mind in the future and not lose our cool so easily. -It takes a bigger man to walk away then to throw the first punch-

I may have my childish moments and I hope that is not overpowering. I will not let myself be span round any fingers, worship the grounds that were trampled on. Giving too much did not bring me anything in the past and I've learned my lesson from then. I am only hoping for space in between to compromise. I am not difficult to live with. Neither am I one that portrays great emotions and speaks aloud. My preference is subtle, yet speak volume. I do not appreciate loudness, false pretense and forced intellectuals. These do not impress me, on the contrary, it pushes me away, making me shut many doors in the process. Perhaps I'm not as chripy like the day, perhaps I'm most comfortable like the night, fitting like a pair of gloves with the darkness. This is just me, no sudden changes, no hidden identity. I am the same person with all, that might sound a little harsh and hard, but least I'm so with everyone. It is just me, what you see is what you g
