poems that was online and loved what I was reading, it was both visual ( i could use it as a dream in my film) and just beautifull stated as if spoken by my main character.   Noticing an email for this woman I took it upon myself to contact her. We conversed a bit thru email then it seemed that she was going to be at the Poetry Fest meeting so I couldn't wait to meet her in person.  I was dealing with the constant problems I was having with patient R and was looking to reconnect with someone new as a friend.  Orderly S cut out of the meeting early and so did I and we conversed a bit with an exchange in numbers. I was actually quite happy to meet a like minded soul and thrilled about the prospect of someone new in my life.  Here started what would become a weeks worth of mixed signals on both ends.. I wwas seeking friendship and she was just seeking time to chat with someone new. I wanted actual time to socialize where as she was content to just email me while at work..Then some of her emails became open/honest and downright personal..the kinds of things I would discuss with a future mate..which is why i felt like she wanted more than a friendship and that's why she didn't want to classify it as a friendship..so I in turn replied in the same frank fashion leading us both down the wrong path  Which is kinda funny...the more I think about it  As i always tend to do I wrote a poem for her..yeah maybe there was a feeling of a  romantic nature behind the words..but it was just cos i was feel so euphoric from speaking to her..and i tend to write poetry about all my friends in my life male and female  So the week consisted of fascinating emails from her written in like this cool cockney slang groovy speak..which i was totally diggin...and a few phone calls...  although a we were maybe to get together to see one hell of a crappy film and she was apt to lend me her copy of the JC Superstar CD cos I was gonna see the play soon..One day at work on a whim she called me..i'm sure I was stressin with my work load..and it wasn't the time or place to get a personal call..I can only imagine how rude I must've sounded..so the next day it's all over...she doesn't want to be friends  and i get over it and go back to life in hell with patient R  a few months pass Orderly S and I perform together at the Poetry reading and decide to clear the air on what transpired before thru the email again  So even if Orderly S and I never really connect as friends (or for the sake of saving her an arguement that term doesn't have to be used) I am really glad that we spoke again anyways  Hope to see her sometime soon a
