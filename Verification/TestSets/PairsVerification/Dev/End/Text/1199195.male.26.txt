pissed, how my partner pissed, how God pissed. I took him into custody, at which time he went on to say that he was going to tell the judge that he wasn't the only one who pissed. That I did it, that the judge did it. Yeah. Thank you, doctor. What a dildo. I told him he had a pretty open & shut case against me. lol. He then congratulated me on being a hero for arresting him, which I thanked him for. Always nice to get a compliment. At the station he went on to shoot his mouth off more at me, and at my partner, whose name he kept severely mispronouncing, which seemed highly amusing at the time. After a while I just referred to him as the wrong name too. lol. Somehow it went from being an Italian name to a French name. Drunk people do this a lot. They'll come to the office sober to complain that they didn't receive a warm welcome, and say a name of someone who doesn't even work there. lol.   Anyway, he got tough right before I took him home and stood up and asked me what else I wanted to charge him with. I said, "I don't know, what else would you like to be charged with?" "Well  YOU'RE  the law, you tell me", he replied. I said, "Pal, until they make being an asshole illegal, I can't charge you for that. My hands are tied. *shrugs*" lol. He didn't seem to appreciate that. When we dropped him off, he got to his porch, and exercising another one of his God-given rights, the right to do whatever you want on your own property (which does not exist), flipped us off and said "fuck" about 60 times. As he fished around his wife's purse for the keys, a roach fell out onto the porch, which I picked up. Normally I don't bother with weed, but he was such a dick. He yelled "fuck you" some more, and my partner made kissy noises at him as I wished him "sweet dreams" and waved. lol. And to think they pay me for this.   I then had the pleasure of taking his wife for an intoxylizer test, where she persisted at being a bitch and telling me how stupid I, along with the rest of my department was, how I was a little kid, how I was not a man. I'm pretty good at back-and-forth drunk banter, so eventually she shut up. On the way out she kept saying, "I don't want you to touch me", even though I wasn't. Finally I just told her, "Honey, your skanky ass is the last thing I want to touch." She shut up after that, got in the car and looked out the window. I don't know why I get so nasty w/people sometimes. Well, I do. You can only handle someone talking shit to you for about an hour straight before you start saying things back. So, it's good times as usual. Sweet dreams, kids. *kissy n
