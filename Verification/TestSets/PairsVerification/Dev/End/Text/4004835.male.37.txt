position on Iraq was akin to a bully beating up a developmentally disabled child, and then getting caught.  The bully will make up story after story, excuse after excuse, until ultimately ending up with some inane justification, like "He made me beat him up!"  Meanwhile, all of the bully's defenders have long since shook their head and walked off in disgust.  This is along those lines.  I am reminded of a middle school class president election, where the bully's strategy is to make fun of his opponent.   It usually starts off with cutting comments about the opponent's clothes or hairstyle, and ultimately ends up with ridiculous claims -- "He likes to sniff other people's butts in the locker room!"
The O's blow a four run lead and Erubiel Durazo hits three homeruns as the A's beat the O's,  urlLink 5 to 4   Durazio hit two homers off of Sidney Ponson, and hit his last one off of B.J. Ryan to seal the win for the Athletics.  In other news, former Oriole Mike Mussina got roughed up in his  urlLink first start  since coming off of the DL.
I was doing a little research into Gus Triandos, and I came across this blockbuster trade that went down on 11/18/1954 between the Orioles (who had just finished their first season since moving from St. Louis) and the New York Yankees.  The Orioles traded Bob Turley, Don Larsen (who pitched a perfect game for the Yankees in the 1956 World Series), Billy Hunter, Mike Blyzka, Darrell Johnson, Jim Fridley and Dick Kryhoski for Gus Triandos, Willy Miranda, Gene Woodling, Harry Byrd, Jim McDonald, Hal Smith, Bill Miller, Kal Segrist, Don Leppert and Ted del Guercio.  This was an important trade because it brought a lot of new blood into the Orioles franchise and helped the team to establish its own identity.
The  urlLink Washington Post  has an editorial about baseball in Washington.  The thesis of their argument is this:  "...the San Francisco Giants, playing in a glamorous new stadium, are on a pace to draw 3.2 million fans this year. Meanwhile, the Oakland Athletics, in an old stadium not well suited to baseball, can expect to bring in more than 2 million for home games. And keep in mind that these two stadiums are only about 17 miles apart, not 35 or 40 or whatever distance would separate a Washington area team from the Baltimore Orioles." Of course, they also mention that both teams are playing  good  baseball, which really isn't true of both the Orioles or the Expos.
Eric Byrnes, Adam Melhuse and Jermaine Dye homered and Scott Hatteberg hit a grand slam as the A's blew out the O's, 11-0.   Rodrigo Lopez pitched 5 1/3 and gave up 3 runs to go to 10-8 on the season.  John Parrish, Todd Williams and Eddy Rodriguez combined to give up 8 more runs.
According to the  urlLink Baltimore Sun , Jerry Hairston possibly broke his ankle after landing hard on his left heel.  An X-ray showed a crack on his ankle and the Orioles have scheduled a CT s
