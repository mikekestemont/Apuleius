says "Bathtub Fitter - The Perfect Solution."  Every time I see it, I think to myself "Bathtub Hitler - The  Final  Solution."  That's just wrong isn't it?

And this here's the TV. Two hours a day, either educational or football, so you don't ruin your appreciation of the finer things.    I wandered off from my desk today and went to the school library...I often do this, mostly to avoid work, and because I like to read...  I was lazily skimming the book titles, when a collection of 'Will Roger's Daily Telegraphs' caught my eye. I have always heard of Will Rogers, and I knew he had been described as a "humorist", but I had never really read anything he wrote.   The book appeared to be a collection of daily telegrams he had sent to America while he was in Europe in the 1920's...I read a few of them, and chuckled at a few obscure or dated phrases he would use, and after a while I realized that Will Rogers was  really  funny...He was talking about events and fads (such as swimming the english channel, a craze that apparently swept the globe at one point) that took place some 60+ years before I was born, but it didn't really matter because of his humorous writing style...He would write things like how he had been thrown out of a cricket match for applauding and being a "boisterous element"...  It's hard to describe, but it was funny...  I'm going to have to sneak off tomorrow and read some more...
You know, there's like a butt-load of gangs at this school. This one gang kept wanting me to join because I'm pretty good with a bowstaff.    Napoleon Dynamite.  This little film is, by far, the funniest movie I have seen since I went and saw Anchorman like, last week.  Napoleon Dynamite is the kind of film that is so good, it alters your vocabulary...You walk around for days saying "What the flip?!" and accuse people of "Eating all of our steak!" You dream of  urlLink sweet  bike jumps, nupont fiberware bowls, and ligers (bred for their skills in magic.)  Soon, the film will fade into memory, the phrase " This one tastes like the cow got into an onion patch " won't be a funny as it used to be, and I'll be able to look at tater tots without having a compulsion to stuff them into my pocket, but until then, I'll be throwing the phrase "Heck Yess!" into conversation until people beg me to stop.  LUCKY!
I caught you a delicious bass.   Is is possible that your feet can make you sleepy?  Until today I would have said " stop talking to me and go away "  But, today I bought some inserts for my new  urlLink shoes ...they're great!  It's like walking an a pillow! And now I'm really s
