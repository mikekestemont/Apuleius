to take a look around the room.   Runch is still fast asleep.   Poe, who's on my left, is, as always, lost, confused, and bewildered (often at the same time). His face is bright red with anger, as he's angry at himself and the rest of the world for not being able to comprehend what Aj. Graham's teaching.   Kaeng is about to make another annoying remark. I quickly went on the defensive by going on the offensive, telling him to mind his own fucking business ad to stop reading my fucking journal. Dispirited, his eyes returned to the board.   Having dealt with that attenuate chum of mine, I now resumed my observations. Wow, who is seated directly in front of me, seems to be attentively paying attention, although I doubt it.   Lin is secretly reading what seems to be a small novel (one of those romantic ones women are fond of, I suspect) under her desk. Far away, in the north-west corner of the room, was a group of people who were really, really, trying their best to earn A's.   My unfaithful sidekick Boom was among them, a lonely barbarian in the midst of the cultured. Oh well, at least I'll know who to depend on during the Physics test.   Behind me, things have quietened down as Art and Ice have apparently ran out of erasers. Nic and Jiek are jotting down notes while having a friendly chat with each other (probably on some teenage issue, as where to hang out or who to fuck).   Kaeng again attempts to communicate with me. But before he could utter a word, I spat out at him, no Kaeng, I do not want to hear whatever it is that you want to say, so shut the fuck up.   Where was I? Oh, yes. Having managed to decorate Chee's head with conspicous little pieces of erasers, Tum duly sped away to join Kit's group (the ones who were actually studying Physics).   Lin suddenly smacks Tor, probably because of boredom. I, however, cannot confirm this as I've only seen the after-effect (i.e. Tor rubbing his shoulder and moaning out loud).   Now, it's time for me to end this entry, as Aj. Graham is wrapping things up and I better pretend to be paying careful attention, in case he'll let us go early.
ROTC this year is just going to be hell. First off, I was made, along with Tor and Tang, a squad leader. Which is bad enough, considering that I was at the front of the line and, more importantly, that Poe was also in my squad. As most people will be able to tell, the whole thing's going to be a rerun of  Full Metal Jacket  , with me as  Joker  and the hapless Poe as  Private Gomer Pyle .
They've told me time and again to put my writings, rants, and raves on the net. Having spent way too much time reading through other people's blogs have convinced me to get a life. Well, I've decide to start one of my own. And here it i
