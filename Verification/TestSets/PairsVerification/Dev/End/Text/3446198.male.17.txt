guess that's my excuse for not posting for a while.  summer starting to slow down.  the other day i realized that we are already in august.  needless to say, i was saddened; in 3 short weeks i start up again with school.  i'm taking 3 AP classes, an above-AP honors class, and i've got to finish off my summer reading books, if by ' finish ' you mean ' start and finish '.  and on top of that, i've got to start regulating my body clock.  if i keep up with my nocturnal schedule, i'll probably feel like crap and look it too after the first week or two.  it's been a long day, and i'm expecting to crash any moment now.  goodnite everyone.  ---Goei---
i was never very good at lazy sunday afternoons.  i haven't a clue why not; they seem to be what i'm always asking for: a quiet day with no distractions.  but there's something in me that wants something to happen.  something wrong possibly.  call it self-sabotage, a moth to a flame, whatever.  maybe i just enjoy complaining.  meh.  goei is goei.  last night i took a quick road trip with my friend to riverside.  the drive was a little over an hour going at least 80 the whole way, which is what i did.  normally you wouldn't be able to go that fast; you see, the traffic is horrible because there's a huge outlet a few miles past riverside.  but we started at around 9PM, so all the stores were closed and the only traffic was going opposite us on the freeway.  riverside is only on the map because there's a u.c. school there, aptly titled U.C. Riverside.  The thing is, we spent about 2 hours driving around there, and not once did i see a river or any other body of water for that matter.  false advertisment.  i think i'll write a letter of complaint to the mayor of riverside.  i can picture it now: ' dear mr. riverside... '  anyways, we were in riverside because it was the farthest norm's location in southern california.  and in case you don't know, our plan is to visit every norm's on the south side of california.  sounds wonderfully stupid doesn't it?   irony alert! : our quest for  norm's  is anything but  normal .  once you boil it down, we drove an hour and used half a tank of gas to buy 2 cups of coffee and a hot chocolate in a town whose name is horrendously misleading.  and the kicker: once we got the check, our waitress wrote us a cheerful little message...                ' come again!  '.  oh i bet we got more than our fair share of sideways glances, because we couldnâ€™t stop laughing after seeing that.  so, yesterday and the week before puts 2 locations down on our list and 15 more to go.  if you asked me why we're doing this, i couldn't tell you and remain seemingly sane to the general public.  that's ok though, life's more fun when people think you're crazy.  -
