    And the music was soothing     And they all started grooving     CHORUS Repeat     It's it's a ballroom blitz     It's it's a ballroom blitz     It's it's a ballroom blitz     Yeah, it's a ballroom blitz
well... i'm pushing buttons on here and i don't know what they do. so..bear with me. VBS is good/scary. there are four boys whom i love- jacob christopher connor and brandon. most of the girls are sweet but there's a few ..interesting ones. oh well it's nice to see the little ones loving God. umm i'm really tired from all this though. i don't like waking up. it's far too early. we are supposed to go to guitar center today for my brother and i want to buy a guitar but i wouldn't mind putting the money towards a beautiful car. ha like mine would even be beautiful. but anyways, i don't really know what i'm going to do except for napping. i am going to wear one of my new thrift store shirts tomorrow to VBS. well......
well.. my parents were kind of dumb today and then it was made my fault, according to them. so then i stopped talking. i just don't respond to them after i'm mad. i should really be sleeping now because i have to get up so so early and it is unethical and yet good because it looks promising and fun. but anyways, betsy told me to come over and hang out with her and miles and co. so then my dad said he was going to bed in five minutes and wouldn't drive me and then my mom said she could take me but i would have to get a ride home but my dad was going to sleep so then i just sat on a chair for awhile and then my mom came down asked why we hadn't left yet and i wasn't happy and said "because you guys told me you were leaving/sleeping and you both did neither of those things." but then she yelled at me because "it isn't my fault that I have to do things and I offered to drive you there" and i don't know what else because i stopped listening. so then i came down here and here i am. typing away. and really tired. and also in desperate need of a shower. ugh.
wheeeeeee vacation bible school!  i love the trailer! i am crazy with no sleep! somebody talk to me!
