 getting tough  " on other Arabs. This is like almost any US president and most leaders in the Western world for the past 50 years have acted and how the other dictators empowered by the West have acted in the past. He's accused Iran of "arming and encouraging" the militia and sending insurgents across the border. He restored the death penalty. There are signs that "   [Allawi] fears losing his tenuous grip on the situation in Iraq.   " It's all horrible, but I can't help but feel like it fits the pattern here. They prop up a dictatorship that cators to the elite, doesn't care to represent the majority of the people, and they act surprised when there are problems with insurgents? Smells like bullshit to me. _ _ _  I don't need graphs and numbers to tell me the job market is still  urlLink going to shit , but of course it doesn't hurt. Well, maybe seeing it does. It hurts a lot of people.

And by "with them", I don't mean supporting corrupt dictatorships that concentrate wealth. I mean that they should actually try to win support of Muslims worldwide.

All it takes is a guy like a bin Laden trying to rally up support against the West to point out how the West treats the Muslim World...then the West will have to deal with over a billion people with anger in their hearts. Anytime there's a powerful emotion like anger directed from one group at another, logic and reason go out the window. When people are angry, of course they don't always make the best decisions. And when people form a group, mob-like mentalities take over. Bring those two together, a
