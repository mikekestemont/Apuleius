as a elementary schooler, to pursue such the novel brand of JNCO.  Now if you are pronouncing it JUH-N-COH, start pronouncing it JEEN-COH.  During this time of my life, others strayed to other brands such as Lee Pipes-a jean that went straight down and was usually ridiculously baggy.  Another blogger, Rob Muilenburg recalls JNCO's by stating "they changed my elementary life in a time when I hated Phil Sobolowski"  Yes, Rob, I agree with you, they did also change my life.  The JNCO scriblle will always live on as long as there is the memory.
Hello!  I arrived at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth on Sunday night and am enjoying a new climate, new colleagues and new sights.  Since Thomas asked about summer reading, I thought I would answer.  Mr. Wargo and Mrs. Grey-Hatton will be teaching the senior AP classes next year.  They have not assigned you any summer reading.  However, take advantage of your freedom and free time this summer and read on your own.  Your primary focus next year will be British literature and poetry.  Perhaps this summer you can indulge yourself in more modern fiction.  You might want to focus on prize-winning book lists like Pulitzer Prize winning novels or Booker Prize winners.  Or focus on modern writers from around the world.  Another option to consider is set yourself up with a book list of classics, because I guarantee you that you'll be in lit classes in college and wish you'd taken better advantage of your free time as people allude to books and authors you've heard of (maybe) but don't really know.  A few books I'd recommend?  Reading Lolita in Tehran The God of Small Things Persopolis Love in the Time of Cholera Anything by Dostoevsky, Chekhov, Ibsen, Woolf, Hardy, Neruda Red Azalea Germinal  Have fun reading, be safe, and have a happy summer!

I just finished my six weeks of intense math camp.........And a short two and half day ASB Leadership camp!!!!!!!!!! Wow...........Way too much to say............... The math camp has elevated my life to a new dimension, with numerous epiphanies occuring and many new friends and bonds made. And many valuable lessons I've learned from math camp, including the fact that I felt incredibly stupid when I was immersed in a sea of of 23 geniuses. And how important friendship and "constructive" competition is. And that's besides all the six week full time math we learned.   I miss the university setting soooooooooooooooooo incredibly much!!!!!!!!!!! I wish I could just be a college student and live in the McMahon dorm from now on for the next few years! Home only brings me the memories of stress, depression, loneliness.............and what not. While the math camp at the university was completely motivational, stress-free, fun......Fun together with learning/bonding experience.   Otherwise, the ASB retreat was mostly a taste of what we have to do next year, the responsibilities we have, the goals we have, and the people we are going to working with. It was quite interesting.........We'll see next year............Although I seriously wish Ms.Clark was still here!      Thomas C
