about their feelings; Dad wanted to watch football or read the paper or, worse, go to work.  But there comes a point when the talking must cease and another kind of work be done.  The last hour was given over to a guided meditation.  The men let their heads fall as the lights in the room went down and they were told to envision Dad in their mind's eye.  John's voice was quiet.  "Tell your dad good-bye.  Good-bye, Dad. I gotta letcha go.  Dad left you.  Now you leave him.  Gotta letcha go."  The sniffles began in the darkened room, and then the keening, and the mewling, and then a loud "Daddy!"  And then another: "Bastard!"  And so ends my long exercise in plagiarism.  But now do you grasp the importance of my decision?  I've always wanted to be the okay dad, but as it turns out that could make me one of the toughest of all - worse even then the passive father who doesn't teach his kids to masturbate!  **************************************************************  The author of the first quote above, in an earlier passage, comments that the "Freudian psychoanalytical enterprise constituted a politics as well as a psychology, and even at times a moral system. Its morality was an inverted Puritanism that conferred upon the most extreme varieties of self-revelation and self-vindication the status of an absolute ethical imperative. In the politics of Freudian analysis, villainy was unequivocally identified with the disabling impostures of the bourgeois family." And finally, "it may well have been this view of the bourgeois family that commended Freudian analysis to intellectuals ...in the wake of their disenchantment with Marxism ... On the couch, Marxian class conflict was transformed into a contest with parents, siblings, and spouses, while the bourgeois enemy remained firmly in place as the obstacles to be surmounted."  The essay that contained these comments was a review of memoir published by a literary critic who, in her private life, was dedicated to her own psychoanalysis. She remarks in the memoirs that "Freudian thought excited much emotions among intellectuals, but not much intellection. Intellectuals tended, indeed, to voice their opinion of analysis in the language of religion: one 'believed' or did not 'believe' in it." Her husband, also a famous literary critic and devotee to psychoanalysis, received what must have amounted to his last rites in the Freudian religion, meeting for one last session with his analyst at his deathbed.  Perhaps rather than confessing in search of absolution, he simply sat quietly while his analyst assured him, and any higher power that may have been listening, that any buggery he may have committed in life ultimately is the fault of his distant father, or smothering mother, or a combination of the two. Of course, his parents probably had already walked through the Pearly gates on the strength of their own parents' shortcomings, and so on down the line until we get to Adam and Eve, who really didn't have any say in their creation. The blame regresses back to God; there is no need to c
