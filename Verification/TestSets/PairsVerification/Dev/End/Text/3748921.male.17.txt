to till tomorrow morning.             Other things he suggested were to eat regularly and eat more, apparently twice a day if I feel like it isn’t enough. If I don’t feel hungry eating’s not really worth it sort of a waste of food that someone else could be eating.             So anyway I have to sort my life out. Apply for more jobs and maybe think of something to do with the money. Also maybe set up my drums again and actual play them since I haven't played in months.              Heh, the lyrics of the song of my lyrics made me giggle:               Serotonin's gone She gave up, drifted away Sara fled, thought process gone She left her answering machine on The greeting left spoken sincere Messages no one will ever hear               I’ll shut up now.

All the silly little things that I spend way too long thinking about. Theres plenty of these per day, they're usually pretty funny if I bother to mention them outloud, maybe not funny as is in "haha, thats hiliarious, your a genius." more "haha, why do you bother to think they way you do?."  I'd write these little werid thoughts down if only I could remeber them.  As always I'd love to know how the human mind works.  A few weeks ago while in the car going to my dads my dad says "did you know someone died on this road earlier this week?" obviously I didn't know 'cause I'm not from Rotheram, so I ask how and my dad says "it was a man, and he got hit by a police car right outside the ambulance station" the first thing that came out of my mouth was "well they were nearly lucky" in my opinion thats pretty nasty and mean and whats worse I didn't care about what I just said and I still don't .  I've never had the best attitude towards life that was pretty mean and disrespectful to whoever died. If I bother to think I'm sure I can remeber them.  [now playing - NOFX - Drop The World]

Haha, I got a postcard thats supposedly rude, now my mum thinks someones corrupting my tiny innocent mind. How its rude I don't know, maybe I just don't get it. Thats probably it.   Fact:  If you were a leap year child you'd have to be 120 years old to be 30.  Fact:  Novacaine is a really crappy film.  Fact:  I'm out of stuff to say.  Fact:  I still hate blogger a little bit.  Fact:  Jayce rocks. (so does Leon too, my thieving sis made the gurge CD appear in her room, cow.) Now I need to find  a postcard to send back and I still need to think of something to send to dead.
