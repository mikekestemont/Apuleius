important aspect of the story however. Mystic River is basically about three old friends, Jimmy (Sean Penn), Sean (Bacon) and Dave (Tim Robbins). They lost contact with eachother a long time ago because of a terrible experience they went through. While they were playing on the street as kids, Dave was kidnapped by a couple of men who abused him for four days. Many years later, the friends are brought back together only because of another gruesome event, the killing of Jimmie's daughter, Katie. Sean is the detective responsible for the investigation of her death and Dave is one of the murder suspects.  It occured to me that the three friends have one important thing in common. They are all driving their loved ones away from themselves. Take Jimmy for example. He loves his daughter Katie, but we learn that she was about to leave her father and family because Jimmy doesn't want her to be involved with her boyfriend, Brendan. The same goes for Sean. He pushed his wife away from him, probably because of his work as a policeman, and now they barely have any contact. Then Dave. He is the one who was kidnapped as a kid. He never told his wife about this, and so she can't relate to his mental problems. This ultimately drives them apart. I think that this element, of driving away loved ones, has something to do with the central thought behind the movie, but I've not been able to figure it out yet. The main plotline is very well done. The acting is great and Mystic River provides with great drama.  The police investigation, the main drive behind the story, isn't satisfying however. Part of the fun of watching police detectives solving a murder mystery usually comes from the fact that the viewers can join the investigators in their research. They can try to solve the crime themselves. If they succeed in doing so, they feel as smart as the movie detectives. I think this is one of the things that makes watching police stories so satisfying. In order to achieve this, it's nessecary to provide the viewer with clues. They also have to be able to follow the reasoning of the detectives at all time, because this allow the viewers to become actively engaged in solving the puzzle.  A lot of characters and names are introduced in  Mystic River . Sometimes this makes it hard to follow the logic of Bacon and Fishburne (this might have been so hard for me because I was a bit tired when I saw the movie). Besides this, there is no way the viewer can tell who the real killer is, because there are not enough clues provided. The end doesn't come as a complete surprise, but it's just not satisfying because you aren't really allowed to participate in the research that leads to the conclusion of the story.   Mystic River  tends to drag on a bit, but I liked most of it. It's not a movie that I would like to see again, h
