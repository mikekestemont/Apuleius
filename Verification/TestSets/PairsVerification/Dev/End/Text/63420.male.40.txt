However, clicking on the link generated the error message in the above posting. Instead, try this  urlLink URL  and you should get to the right place:    urlLink http://www.hello.com/how_bloggerbot_works.php    Using the link immediately above you can download the software and, in conjunction with with Picasa or Windows Explorer (not sure what Mac users do), you will have a method for transferring pictures to the web. (Bloggerbot offers free image hosting.) Unfortunately I wasn't able to get it working so smoothly on my first try (my last post) or in this post. (Otherwise I would be able to include the error picture within this message.)  I will obviously need to research this a little more.
If you are a nonprofit organization (non religious) you may qualify for free web hosting at  urlLink Grassroots.org  . You need to complete the  urlLink request form  and will be required to add the banner below to the top of your site.
Another online resource similar to that in my  urlLink post from July 23 ...  If you're interested in government and social policies from a research point-of-view, the National Center for Policy Analysis, a Washington D.C.-based volunteer organization, has a great site called  urlLink Both Sides  which, as the name implies, presents both sides of issues (e.g. environmentalism, federal spending, unions, etc.). The materials are culled from published articles, interviews and press releases.
Yippee !!!  I finally did it !  I made it into the top 1% of all  urlLink SETI At Home  users.  (SETI At Home is a project that uses the computer downtime of PC's to analyze data obtained from telescopes at the University of California at Berkeley.  The project currently has over 5,000,000 users and was one of the first major applications of distributed computing using the general public.  Users automatically download data and upload the analyzed results.)   It took me quite a long time (as you can see on the graphic), but there are simple strategies for making the processing efficient.   1. Use  urlLink Easy SETI  which runs the processing in the background, rather than the screen wasting display of the regular  urlLink SETI program .  (I had some unit cycles that were 100+ hours long, and now I regularly have 6-8 hour cycles.)  2. Run the program as "low priority" so that it doesn't grind your machine(s) to a halt for other applications.   3. Run the program on all of your computers, especially the fast ones.   (Big surprise.)  4. Increase the queue in EasySETI.  The Berkeley site that is regularly down so if you're done processing a unit you're not at their mercy to get new data for processing.
Time for another Google-related post.&nbsp; To see a visual representation of a URL and its related sites (meaning  similar  -&nbsp;using the Google search term "related:" ), look at the  urlLink TouchGraph Google Browser .&nbsp; Enter a URL and see what other sites and pages are connected.  I'm not exactly sure how the results are derived.&nbsp;&nbsp; When entering my own  urlLink home page , one of the highest related sites is a  urlLink Swedish entertainment site &nbsp;.&nbsp; S
