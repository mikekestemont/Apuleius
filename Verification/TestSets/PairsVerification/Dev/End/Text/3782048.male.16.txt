4th prescription, the Doctor prescribed me a similar drug, but with less side effects.   It's kinda working. I took my first one yesterday at 9am-ish. All went well till about an hour, then i got pains for about 3 hours non stop. Had a break from them for a few hours, they came back.  I woke up today (WELL DUH! lol) and, um, I missed the dose by about 30 minutes. On any previous prescription I wouldn't be in much pain by then, only 30 minutes late. But all I got today was a sharp pain which lasted even after I took the pill. Just for being 30 minutes late.   The sleeping pills don't work. All I can say on the matter.  Am I becoming dependant on meds?  Peace for now, IlovekurtyIlovecharlieIloveandyIlovemona
I love making songs on la guitar. Calms me down, and I cna also be proud for a few seconds. I know it's not long, but still it's cool. To anyone a song i make up is nothing but to me, it's like a huge collection of emotions. My psychatrist reckons my emotions control me too much. When I play a home made song, lol, it's like I control them, like everyone else does.  I'm proud. :D
I love my new unoffical random  job.  Seriously, it's great. I don't mind working all day. Just incase readders think I am being sarcastc I am not. I have to wait up at 7:30 tomorrow, go to Harmony Music, move some piano's, then I work all day. For some reason I love it. Great people to work with, and I do everything. The till, the card machine (ugh...just gotten used to it), doing demo's, explaining stuff, and telling people how old Paul is.   But tis cool. I also plan to wake up early 2moro, maybe 5 or 6, have a shower, go out with Black Saphire (can't get a girl, get a guitar :S), go somewhere non-urba, and play for a bit. Then go to work. The morning is beautiful.
She's my friend, And I can't pretend, That I don't want anymore, Than her friendship.  But I must lie to her now, I wish somehow, I could tell her I love her, But I can't. She has the life, A perfect life too, I'd just ruin it, Something I always seem to do. These two were made for each other, The perfect lovers, And I'm trying to fit in somewhere, But I haven't realised, Lovers don't come in threes, but pairs, Maybe I should keep this rule memorised. There's no point in trying, She's with someone, And there's no point in lying, Her love for him is never gone, And who am I to get in the way? She tells me she loves him almost everyday. She's defined her love for him, And maybe I'm just too dim, To realise, she's happy, She doesn't want me. It's nothing new. Maybe I should take some good advice, Something I've heard more than twice, I should just quit while I'm ahead, Continue this and I'll be d
