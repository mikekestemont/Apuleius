what makes me unhappy at work.  This may not be far from your frustration of having to deal with switching the “On” button when you rather be in Virginia.
My call went unheard last week, however I will continue this venture with the idea of "You'll see the light".  Today which was properly aligned with the first of the month I told my job I was resigning and will be going to graduate school in August.  They took it pretty well and an event I thought I would enjoy over this past year met me with nervousness.  I'm not exactly sure why.  However, I could share some moments that made me want to storm in and either quit on the spot or only give them 2 weeks notice (I gave them a month's notice).    Off the top of my head and the most recent was the case of the stupid computer user.  Now I despise most people for various reasons and I guess in classic IT form, I hate most of the users I work with.  However, I usually snap out of that and enjoy working with most of the people at my job.  I never thought I would run into a situation that you would only read in an email forward.    I got the call that the computer was not working.  I went to see what the problem was and indeed to my surprise the computer was off.  Not broken, simply turned off.  Next to the monitor, the CPU tower sits next to it.  Over the front of the case is a sheet with information on it that covers the "on" button.  Above this sheet, there is a Zip disk drive that is used all the time by the user.  When asked why the user didn't turn it on, she replied,"I didn't know where it was."  This is what I must get away from.  My mind tells me not to cal these people idiots and that I am not better than them but you can't help but feel that indeed they are idiots.  Only because they don't have the resoning skills to look at thier environment and solve the problems in front of them.  I believe this is a skill that should be taught to all children.  Problem solving.  Even if you don't know the subject you are confronted with, if you have problem solving skills, you can at least make an attempt.  The simplicity of looking 4 inches to the right, deciphering that underneathe the sheet is a CPU, lifting the sheet, and turning on the computer escaped this poor soul's low mental abilities.    The scary thing is that this person is one of the technicians in charge of scanning patients with a CT machine.  I think I would rather have a pigeon covered in mayonaise scan me before that low level of living.  But I look towards the sky and I see the sun smiling at me.  I know there is a place where I will be soon that will allow my mind, body, and soul thrive...Virginia.   Peace  C
