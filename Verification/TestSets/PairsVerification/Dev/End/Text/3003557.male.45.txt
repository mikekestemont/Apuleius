getting smacked up? I do miss him though. An old friend isn’t like an ex lover. I’d like to see him one day. But I don’t know if I forgive him or if he has forgiven me.
Family Weekend  I met the kids at Liverpool Street Station, after their brief trip to their mum's. H had got quite upset with her mum who refused to take them into Ipswich (train to London every 15 minutes) and took them to the local station (train every two hours) , got the times wrong, and generally caused them to be 3 hours later getting back to Devon ("Oh it doesn't matter if you are a couple of hours late for work, dear". It bleedin does if you get paid by the hour and could easily get the sack for not showing up. It's all very well if you capture (sorry, marry) a millionaire and have never had a proper job in your life but other people have to work. Great fun spending extra hours travelling with a 16 month old baby with you, too).  Anyway, I met them and the four of us travelled across to Paddington, where it was a long wait for the next train west. It was also a very popular tain, resulting in the boy and I standing from Reading to Taunton. Anyway, I was very proud how my little extended family coped. Later, H and her little one rejoined M, the Boy and I and some chums to watch the carnival. There's a line in Neil and Tim Finn's current single about "everyone that I love being all in the same place" (or something) and it was like that. I was quite overcome.  Saturday too M and I to the beach to watch the gig racing (rowing) and our friend's boat came second. H and the little one joined us and we took Little One off to play on the beach. I must admit it is the first time I have buried a baby up her neck in sand. She seemed to enjoy it though. Usual mess with ice-cream after. Happy baby rinsing for her mum to do after (sand and icecream).  Sunday, two free tickets took us to the zoo. H and Little One came along. The Tiger was hiding, the gorillas and heffalumps are quite smelly. I suspect Little One is too young for the zoo. It is quite difficult to stand 6 feet from 3/4 tonne of bison and be more interested in the rock on the ground, but she managed it. Apart from that, Paignton Zoo is a good way to spend 3 hours. During our visit, the boy rang asking me to drive 10 miles to pick him up because his bike had broken and he was 2 miles from home. Naturally, I declined (suggesting a taxi)  and felt bad for the rest of the visit. When we got home, the bike appeared to have fixed it self, thus demonstrating the benefits of firm parenting.   No internet at home currently so limited time at w
