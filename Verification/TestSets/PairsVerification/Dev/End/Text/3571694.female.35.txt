to booking ourselves into a "love Motel" just for the cool air.  Out of the blue, my boss informed me that they were coming to install this thing and I was speechless.  He himself was here until a few moments ago and was "supervising".  I showed him some of my prints and was reminded of my past life as a photographer.  I told him I had to have a show soon to remind myself I was a photographer, so he asked me for a profile which I will start working on after I blog here, and he will try to get me something soon.  He also knows a professional photographer who has a darkroom and will ask if I can print there, so the B&W I have done of Ecuador and Korea will slowly get printed.  Thank God I brought my negs.  My friends Lori and Jason just had a baby girl.  I got a photo and I must say this baby is the most beautiful thing I have seen in a long time.  I want one of my own and I do think both Chris and I have good genes, so we will make beautiful kids, and hopefully they will be intelligent and dilligent like him and sharp and adorable like me (hey someones got to stroke my ego).

When it is hot like this I dont want to clean, cook, or do much but watch tv.  All that will change now with AIR CON!
Well, I am in the second week of "Summer vacations" which means the kids dont go to school and we work harder.

This morning, at 9:15 I was sitting in the study of one of my students when the PA system came on INSIDE the apartment. I thought it was a warning for everyone to vacate the building, so I asked what it was saying. My students who otherwise seemed uneffected by this loud speaker announcing Korean into their home, stopped and listened and then said: "There is a trip someplace and they are telling us in case we want to go".  It might not seem like much, but it seemed really intrusive to me to have this thing blaring out useless information into an apartment and especailly at 9:15 during summer vacations. Quite frankly I would have been quite peeved if I was trying to sleep- which I would have been doing if I werent teaching.  On a brighter note, the weather is not quite so oppressive today and Oscar managed to walk all the way to the dog groomers where he is at now. I pick him up at 2.  Off to have my second shower of the day and it is only n
