Well today had its good and bad times... It was mainly a lazy lazy day that I spent with my sick little sister... :( The poor girl is miserable and has a really high temp. it doesnt help that our house is a toaster over. ICKY!!    Tonight was fun though. It was another night at jonny's and it was fun!!! We played some more nutball (its nutball not what I called it last time) We lost!!! BOO FRICKITY WHO!!! It was fun and James bought us some candy and we saw sexy Will at kwik trip... Mandy take him up on that "long conversation"!!!! do it!!! haha... And amanda and i took jim's car out... opps thats not quite legal but a lot of fun... we took it through main street!!! oh man!!! good times...   Um... I have a perdicament... Friday is sailing and i cant wait but... now i just got an email from my dad saying that if we dont go all day Veronica wants to get all of us together... including: ellen, tim, chadd, michael, nelly, amanda, and our family... i really want to do that!!! AHHH I dont know what to do because i really want to spend time with them but i cant just bail on sailing and i cant make everyone else cut the time short... i guess i should just stick with sailing and see if we get back in time to do it... AHHHHHHH!!!! And then sumathy gets here on the 8th which is sunday and shes staying until the 11th or 12th... epp... what am i going to do with her... i guess i will just drag her out with us... i mean dont get me wrong i am super pumped but i just dont know if she will have any fun because she has so much to do in lacrosse and here we just sit and play nutball... haha... we'll see... well im tired and i need to go discuss sailing with kev...    nighty night   -gabby
well there are 12 days until my birthday!! AHHH It should be fun... last night I went for a little walk with amanda and then we just sat at her house... for just sitting there it wasnt that bad... i mean we always find some random thing to talk about... we discovered that shes going to marry some random famous, rich baseball player and I am going to marry a really smelly, scrubby, dirty, famous, rich skater boy!!! and then mandy's going to cheat on her husband with one of my hubbie's buddies!! haha... we thought of all that last night... being really lame and all today... well im not sure what is going to happen today... hopefully something fun... but i dont know... i kind of want to sit in my hot tub for awhile but i dont think its working right now... i dont know amanda and i are planning on bugging someone adios -
