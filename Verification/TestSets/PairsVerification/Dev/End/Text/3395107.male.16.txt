needs a rest.Adieu.
It's now the first week of Term 3.Things have been going rather up-and-down like a rollercoaster ride for me.I need to collect my thoughts...
Last Sunday I went to St James' Church.However it seemed that Jie Hui was rather caught up with a lot of work, so she was unable to watch the movie with me.She had to prepare for a church play,and also had to juggle her workload at VJC.It seems that VJC will stop at nothing to press its students to give it all the glory.How sad life is...nowadays S'pore is producing only "hard disk drives".It is apparent that A1s are like the life support systems for most of the friends I know.Goodness.If only they realised that Jesus Christ is the answer to all their needs instead of result slips that can perish.I just realised that without Jesus,I'm like a robot without the batteries plugged in.Of course,in Australia the situation is'nt so bad.It is far better to seek the Kingdom of Heaven first than all these results which will not get you anywhere. Prestige, power, glory,wealth, etc will all be destroyed ultimately.Every knee will bow to Jesus, and He will get all the glory.It's all the fault of this evil system of globalism. For the sake of getting a top notch economy, Singapore and countries like Japan are pressing their students to excel.It is clear the god of this world, Satan, is behind all this nonsense in order to take people's minds off Jesus. He has done it successfully even among Christians. Anyway,yesterday met Ben Choong and Daryl Soh for lunch.Chatted with them,and introduced the two to each other-they are in the same JC. they portrayed NYJC as being less stressful compared to VJC.After that watched Spiderman 2.Quite unimpressed...Doc Ock was quite a pathetic villain, a good guy under the control of his own machine. He does not seem formidable, and the physics in the show is rather fictitious and ridiculous. How can a mini sun attract all the metals, and yet sink into water without smoke?Heehee...:P Doc Ock had an interesting saying, "Intelligence is a privilege to be used for the benefit of humanity".I fully agree with him at this point.
Lecture on Gauss' Law today for electric fields.Quite interesting except for the technical details. Then did tutorial on Trapezoidal Rule.Had Dinner today and the guest-of-honour was the First Lady of Timor-Leste, the wife of Xanana Gusmao, President of Timor Leste.She was a graduate from the University of Melbourne and author of a book.She gave a speech about her adopted country and highlighted the problems there,which pertain to health, poverty and some maritime issue regarding the seas around Timor Leste.It was a formal dinner today but I did not know that I was supposed to dress formally.Luckily nobody noticed.They served turkey and potatoes and some overcooked vegetables plus soup (which I think was minestrone). They also served garlic bread.It was a formal occasion lasting about 2 hours.However during the dinner my headache persisted.I suspect it is due to a blood pressure build-up behind my left eyeball-papilledema. Quite f
