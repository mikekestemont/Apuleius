town hall where I work si pretty impressive for the size of the town at four stories high (it looks like something out of EPCOT). A little ways down they are building a town center that is the size of the ODome in Gainesville or the Miami Arena which is also impressive. The water in the beaches are blue and crystal clear from what I have seen as I drive next to them (I still have not gone).  A quick comment about the food (SO GOOD!). Today I had sushi 6 pieces and two rice pastry balls (not sure what that is) for about 2.50 american. I bought it at the grocery store ACOOP. They also have fresh sashimi there for about 6-9 dollars. At work they make fresh green tea and coffee at least twice sometimes 3 times a day. I also had ramen yesterday at a small shop that is not like your ramen back home. It was made with fat wheat noodles soaked in this delicious broth of green onions, garlic and (real fatty) pork.  Well thats it for now. Ive been sending out some emails but have not received any replys. I think that my aol may not be receiving new emails. So therefore try to post comments on this web site until I can get a new email. Talk to you probably next Monday because I still dont have Internet at home. (The school computer guy fell off a cliff while fishing, I am not sure what is going on with that). Oh, and this weekend there is a town festival that they keep on inviting me too. My boss asked me to sing kareoke there (I dont know about that... he said YOU SING AMERICAN SONG KAREOKE). Who knows maybe, what do I have to lose.  Oh and I speak with Cristina every night. I still havent seen her because she had her welcome party yesterday and still doesnt have access to her car but perhaps soon. I speak to her every day though.
