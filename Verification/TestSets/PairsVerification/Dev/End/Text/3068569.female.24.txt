another human being physical or&nbsp;mental distress is not the most upstanding thing to do.&nbsp; apparently not all Americans agree with that though, only a majority do. Since this poll was about the current war in Iraq, I'm guessing that these people who were all cool with torture are probably&nbsp;in no danger of being tortured themselves.&nbsp; Because if they were they'd probably come around to&nbsp;our way of thinking.&nbsp; I mean if&nbsp;you think torture is a dandy way&nbsp;to pass the time then fine, that's your perogative.&nbsp; But you have to believe in torture for everyone, because otherwise you're just a&nbsp;big hypocrite.&nbsp;
I just wanted to let y'all know that  urlLink Ineffectual Whore  is up and running.  Yay!  It's a little side project that  urlLink Eric  and I are doing and if you want to know what it's all about, well then you'll just have to see for yourself.  Now.    No, seriously, go now.  I'll wait right here.
So I was doing RPL in the cult classics dvd section at work today and I think that I may have come across the most awesome movie of all time:  urlLink Jesus Christ: Vampire Hunter .  So Jesus comes back to Earth for his second coming and finds the world overrun by bloodsucking fiends from beyond the grave, who are conveniently impervious to sunlight (I have a feeling this is just because the "auteurs" couldn't afford night shoots).  So before he can get to his preaching, healing, and making entire gourmet meals from the meager contents of my refrigerator, he must kick some undead ass.  Don't worry though, he doesn't have to do it alone.  Oh no, he has Mexican wrestling star "El Santos" to help him. And if dealing with Biblical prophesy and killer bloodsuckers weren't enough, Jesus also has to cope with ever-changing sexual politics.  The best part: it's a  musical !  I'm seriously considering buying this movie.
I just took the quiz from J.B.'s site and apparently:  You are a WEDL--Wacky Emotional Destructive Leader. This makes you an anarchist. You don't give a damn. When push comes to shove, you just forget about it--it's just not worth the heartache. What this means for others is that dealing with you can be aggravating, because they find they can't get you motivated about things they care about. What this means for you is that you are happier, calmer, and saner then they are on their best days.  You are near-immune to criticism, and those who know you well acknowledge and respect that. You may come across as lazy, but the truth is that you find little to get worked up about. Regardless, you have slews of friends, because they are fascinated by your world view, jealous of your lifestyle, and drawn to the fact that you are hilarious to be around.   You are a pillar in a sea of hot-bloodedness. You have a sweet tooth.   Umm.  No.  Well I have a sweet tooth, but I think everything else about that is wrong, wrong, wrong.  A test online couldn't describe my personality accurately?  I'm shocked, SHOCKED I tell y
