tasty, toasty, and easily divisible (but not sliced).  Plus, that I should fit into a dozen different cups feels right to me.  If you would like to fill the comments section with what kind of bread you would be, that would be glorious.
I've never met a Mormon I didn't like. I'm sure there are thousands of irritating Mormons out there, but all the Mormons I know have been kind and smart.  I was reminded of this today because I was thinking about stereotypes. Hell, I'll just say it: Every person I've met from North Dakota has had the personality of a piece of flat bread. Not bad personalities. Just not any zing. Practical people, not given to imbibe in the social lubricant of uncalled for friendliness.  I've never met a North Dakota Mormon either.  Speaking of stereotypes, an attorney hung up on me today for no reason other than he could. What. An. Ass.  In two years, when I am a rich and famous attorney, I will not hang up on the little people.  (kidding, kidding)
I've been stressed and tired, so I've been quiet. After work, I haven't even wanted to answer the phone, and I haven't gone to pick up my snapdragons that a friend is flower sitting for me.  While I'm recharging, I thought I'd share this quote because it's one of my favorites and I've been thinking about it a lot lately. It's Eugene Debs' statement to the court.   Your Honor, years ago I recognized my kinship with all living beings, and I made up my mind that I was not one bit better than the meanest on earth. I said then, and I say now, that while there is a lower class, I am in it, and while there is a criminal element I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free .   urlLink The whole thing is here.
My partner is preaching in Cleveland (which, in fact, rocks), and I went to hear her sermon this morning. She introduced me during the service. She is fantastic and brilliant.  Her sermon was on translation, and part of it concerned what it means to be understood, personally. There is a  urlLink line in the prayer  of St. Francis of Assisi that says, may I seek to "understand rather than to be understood."  When I was more of an  urlLink Objectivist , I thought the prayer was a good example of how Christianity made being subservient and meek ideal virtues so that the powerful could control and manipulate the masses. (What kind of world would we have if religion said, "do what makes you happy and fulfilled"? A better world than we have now, I think.)  Anyway, I know it's important to be heard and sometimes I need to shout. Sometimes I need to sit quietly. Sometimes I need to listen, and sometimes the person talking is such a  urlLink hateful  dumb  urlLink ass  that it's not worth listening to.  Which  is  more important, to understand or to be understood?  I don't k
