though, my life is rather boring and i cant think of anyone who would really wanna read about it i saw spiderman 2 last night..kick ass movie...ya... i have work tonight...stupid work...did i mention that i hate my job? well, i do so yeeeea...  You know what sucks a wHOOOLE lot? when you think u can trust someone, and u think that someone cares as much about you as you care about them, and then u realize that the whole time, they never gave a fuck...can be quite annoying if u ask me...i thought i could prove that my theory that no person can EVER be trusted was wrong, but no, its right, no one can be trusted
so its been quite some time since ive updated this, alot has happend lately! for one, my alarm just went off and i dont feel like getting up to turn it off....god damn anyway, i got grounded starting today, which totally sucks beyond anything, and is really fucking stupid warped tour was on wed, and it was incredible, i met matchbook romance, sugarcult, flogging molly, and motion city soundtrack!!! MCS is my second favorite band so of corse i was freaking out, and i absolutly love flogging molly!!! i also got to take pictures with the bands, which was very cool, and i have alot of bruises from the pit which i am extremly proud of and have been showing everyone! friday was my birthday, a few people blew me off, and ALOT of people complelty forgot that it was my birthday, but other than that i had a good day. i had cake for breakfast, and i got to wear my crown all day! the day actually got good when kathleen came over. shes such an awsome friend. we went to starbucks and she told everyone that it was my bday, and of corse i turned bright red and they sang to me, but then they gave me a coupon for a free drink! and apparently one of the girls working there went to warped and ALSO met flogging molly. so we talked about that for a bit and then we went out to my car. on the way kathleen told every person that walked by that it was my bday then we sat in my car for like an hour talking, and i mentioned to her the problem i have been faced with lately...and then we taled about some other random shit then we went bowling with matt and will and corey. that was so much fun, a couple people i know, gary and shane, showed up and played with us, well no, they didnt pay, thay just took my turns while people held me back lol, but we played until like 1am and it was so much fun then kathleen came over and we stayed up all night talking about my problem...let me tell you, i am quite i mess lately....god damn leah and addie for suggesting what they did...lol so yea...i best go take a shower, i have work t
