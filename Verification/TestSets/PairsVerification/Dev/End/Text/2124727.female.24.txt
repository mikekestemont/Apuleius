there are no gifts, only if there are. So taking them on their word, I just took P20 from my wallet and gave it to the man who helped us with the luggage just before we left. As we looked back to see his reaction, he was pouting, hahaha!  It is really sad and embarrassing that some Filipinos do these things. They are being paid well to do their jobs yet they are harassing tired people arriving to the country. Can you imagine how many thousands of people arrive daily in the country? With their practice, they must earn a lot daily that their monthly pay is just a bonus in comparison. What about not paying these kind of personnel Sir and Madam Manager? Maybe they will think twice about harrassing newly arrived passengers if they are reported and properly reprimanded. Let's say, when reported and proven of doing such practice, their pay is held for 15 days or a month. What about that?  Just thinking...
Taxi flagdown = P25.00 P2.00 is added per kilometer I think. Or is it per 500 meters?  Air Conditioned Bus Minimum = P9.00 (the same as before)  Ordinary Bus Minimum = P6.00 (used to be P4.00)  Jeepney Minimum = P5.50 (used to be P4.00)  Tricycle Minimum = P5.00 (or is it still P4.00?)

Oh well, even if there was no increase for tricycles, some tricycle drivers do not return the change anyway.
I have been thinking about this type of blog for sometime until someone suggested it to me to do it. I was still unsure because I am thinking, there might be no one interested about such things so what's the point. But then I changed my mind because there are just so many things worth noting down that someday I would like to come back to and review. When it is also affordable to print your blog into a book, then I could also do that and for sure, a blog about living in the Philippines would be handy for everyone, especially those coming from the provinces and going to the city for the first time. So what the heck! I might as well start now while I am into it.  When I have enough money, I'll get that Manila Atlas and scan all those maps and post it all here for everyone to use ;) It would be really useful because I have always been trying to find buildings and streets here and it's quite difficult because street names change and new buildings sprout like mushrooms everywhere while older ones are being razed. So much plans for my blog... so watch out my dearie.  Oh! But maybe if I scan the Manila Atlas and post it all here, the publisher or whoever made it will get angry and "sew" me. Ah, come on, I have to do it first anyway. (Pardon the pun.)  I'll just cross the bridge when I get t
