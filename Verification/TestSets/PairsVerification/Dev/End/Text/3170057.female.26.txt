 Morning! Morning! Morning! Mwah! Mwah! Mwah! Come on! Come on! Come on! Dance with me! Laugh with me! This day  And if you want Until tomorrow.  Will you be driving through the metro? A little break here And then again move on Alright then I suppose I will just be waiting For you For your stop For your go.  Think of me will you? Even for a split second That will do. Just knowing I occupied your mind That would be enough To make my heart skip To make me smile a lot.   Musing of a coffee-laden mind. For my dear john.

Jen and I always made a pact that we'll see where this thing is going. 'I'm not sure it really is in our nature to be with someone the rest of our lives, just because you made this pact. 'You keep going as long as you keep growing. When that dies, we do.' But he adds: 'Just when you think you've gotten all you can out of it, you get knocked upside the head. It's good fun.'"  This makes sense! Trully!
