worng wtih her.&nbsp; Thank you, I will look into this matter a bit closer. .""Your welcome."During Lodge meeting I was sitting between two couches, on the floor hidden from all and barely functioning and the residential director came in and sat and watched the meeting, keeping a watch on me.&nbsp; He then&nbsp; told Marlus, our lodge staff to call me after to talk to him in her office. After the meeting I was getting up and she asked me to stay behind and talk to her for a minute. I did Bevil was in the office he asked me about my trip to Target. I said "What about it." My head down, and my focus stays on the floor, but not looking up. I am wearing a nice over sized sweat shirrt with the hoody up.&nbsp; He then asked me to sit and put the hood down. I did but kept looking down.&nbsp; My hair just normal stringy, and my skin tone pale white. He demanded I look at him.&nbsp; I looked at him the action of just raising my head caused me to get dizzy and start to call, he then caught me and he noticed he was just holding up bones. He asked me when the last time I ate was.&nbsp; I said "This morning" "He asked what did you eat?""Energy bar.""Thats not healthy"I became agnry and looked at him and he asked me "How much do you weigh?""I waight about 165lbs.""I doubt that." "Doubt what yee will." "I want you to go to the clinic, tomorrow.""Fine"He gave me a pass and that was the end of it. I went to the clinic before class and the nurse had a full room she asked me what was wrong with me and I said "I just need some bandaids." So she gave me a box and signed my pass to go to class.&nbsp; I was free from that trip.&nbsp; In the clinic was Patrick Cohain the center Shink he asked the nurse where I was.&nbsp; She told him and he left after me. He found me at the pavilion and I was resting. He said "Nice try."And he came over to talk to me.&nbsp; "Hi how are you doing?""Fine, thanks.""I want to talk to you.""Um, ok.""Tell me whats wrong.""If I don't tell you, then you can't fix it right?""right.""I&nbsp; then have nothing to say,"I tried to walk away but I wasn't able to get far due to being dizzy. He decided to walk me to the clinic. He had a hold of my arm and he had a tight grip and when we were in the clinic he let go and saw a bit of blood on his hands he asked me to raise my sleeve and i tried not refuse, but I reliezed i was not getting out of this tight spot. I did he saw my wounds. Mostly bandaged and a few infected. He asked me to bring up the other sleeve and it was the same only not scabbing over, more like close to being scarrs&nbsp; &
