what happened instead of chasing after the professor finding what happened in his wake.  Anyway this entire plot is based off the premise that the major arcana from standard tarot cards is a road map of events/people that have to take place/be put in position to bring about something. This might be technically incorrect as to the original purpose of the tarot. But I figure that it can be explained away by the same kind of logic as santeria. Santeria is a voodoo like religion that was made when Catholics came to the islands. The natives adapted their religion to make it sound like they were worshiping catholic religions while still worshiping their pagan gods. They used saints names to represent the gods etc etc. And with that in mind the cult or people or what ever that started this could have used tarot as a way to show the progression of the prophesy without letting the common occultist in on it.

I had this idea for creating a blog and doing it like a continuous story about a guy. Something like a novel but at a day by day blow. Or more specifically a scene by scene format. I'm not sure how tht would turn out. But I think it sounds like a good thing to try. So if you see another blog attached to my profile then that is what it will be. Unless of course it is a test page for making adjustments to templates to see if they work. But then again that would be named something more like test or work in progress or something more appropriately stupid like that.
Currently I am trying to figure out how to improve this blog. I am not very good at html or web designs. And thus I am unsure as to what I am going to do with it. But then again one can always learn. And anyway its not like this is going to be seen by anyone that is all that critical of me. So there you go...
This is another blog. Yes I know that most of you that will be looking at these blogs will be friends and thus already know about my first blog. This one I have decided to create to give an outlet to my mindless babbling from time to time. Unlike my other blog this one will not show comments but you can make them if you like. I always appreciate criticism.
I know its been a while since I wrote on this particular blog. But then again I write only sporadically on my other one. So you really can't complain. Not that anyone ever looks at these sites anyways. So I figured that I would drop a line in for no apparently good reason. This also is a warning. I'm probably going to be writing a lot more in about a week. Fun fun fun.
