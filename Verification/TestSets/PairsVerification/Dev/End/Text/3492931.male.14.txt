as you saw in the previous sentence, when the article "and" is used in lists or in connecting two sentences. However, this was used incorrectly by just smacking it at the front of the sentence. This problem could be fixed by eliminationg the word "and" at the beginning of that sentence, replacing the exclamation mark at the end of the third sentence with a comma, or replacing the exclamation mark with a semi-colon.        I'll finish this post later, I'm going to go talk to Nicole, I'll be back lllllllllater!
Yes, Nicole got a new phone. Her old one's battery conked out after a few minutes (we found the average to be 18 minutes), but now she has a new phone with a battery that's  super awesome . We've talked 3 times today, all were more than 45 minutes, one of them even twice that length.  One thing I noticed tonight was that I worry so damn  much ! God dammit, I am fucking paranoid about  everything . Whether its small or big, everything freaks me out and I'm always worrying about her and everything. There's a big difference between caring about someone, and annoying them by caring too much.
Alright, this journal isn't like some weird form of shameless self-promotion, I promise. The reason I'm talking about my books so much is because everything I believe is put into those books. Everything I feel strongly about, you will find in there. I was just thinking about this in the shower this morning, and I wanted to clear it up to you. I'm not promoting myself.  I mean....what would promotion do? I don't  sell  my books. I don't have a publisher or anything. My point is that I talk about a lot of deep stuff in here. Probably 90% of that stuff somehow finds its way into my writing. Get the point here?  Man, I haven't been writing in here that much, I really should start catching up. I've been doing a lot of Morrowind, lot of Warcraft III: Frozen Throne, lot of Nicole, lot of writing. Last night Nicole came over and we were going to rent Fight Club (one of my favorite movies) and A Walk to Remember (one of her favorite movies). So we get to Blockbuster, and  GOD FUCKING DAMMIT , they don't have Fight Club. So we rented A Walk to Remember and Carrie, which we thought was the Sissy Spacack (how you spell dat?) version, instead it was some 2002 made-for-tv movie, and it was really gay. So we watched A Walk to Remember, and SURPRISINGLY ENOUGH, it wasn't that bad. I saw a lot of reasons for why she wanted me to see it, but it was cool watching it with her right there. I'll hand it to her, it wasn't bad, wasn't bad at all.  This won't be my last post today, I promise, but I need to go call Nicole and finish letting this Maroon 5 CD download. I  will  be back tonight, I promise! Keep your head up and the sun outta your e
