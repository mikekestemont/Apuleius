 -I said.   "Let's go eat, I'm starving. We can come back latter!"  -she said.   "Ok. Just let me leave a message, in case she can join us!"  -I said.   So I wrote a message and as I was looking for a place to leave it, so the wind wouldn't blow it, I notices that the door was kinda loose. Linda was looking to the other side but she remembered something and turned and said " Maybe the door is open"  ... she grabbed the knob and pushed the door open... My heart sank!   There I was, knealing in front of the door and staring inside the apartment. There was nothing. It was empty. She moved and did not say a thing, and I was thirsty and hungry! Linda is more relaxed, she pointed the obvious:  "I knew this was not the building! It's the next!"       4.55 pm.      "Ding, Dong"  ........................................  "I thought you were not coming!"  -Alejandra said-  "It's late!"     Damn it was hot inside the apartment. I almost faint inside. Alejandra was all tanned and ready to leave for the pool.      urlLink     It was hot that day!&nbsp; urlLink       She made us something to eat and spent some quality time together. I kept looking [ according to Linda and Alex ] rather sad and depressed. I drank so much water that I gave the impresion of being hang over.      6.55 pm.  &nbsp;    "It may be time for us to leave"  -Linda said.
Groucho Marx      5 months: around 150 days: 3600 hrs: 216000 min. More or less; I'm not a calculator or a calendar for that matter. What am I talking about? Christmas! Too soon? Maybe. But that beautiful feeling; those chilly mornings; the excruciating anticipation a week prior to the 24th; snuggly sweaters; soft and silky drinks; being buried in a pile of blankets and quilts in a cold, cloudless night; family; love; memories...  The best time of Year. This will be one of the greatest years for Xmas. I'm expecting a lot of memories, a lot of moments, a lot of love and family.  I remember as a child those Friday nights in winter, in bed; my brother; a cup of hot cocoa with rainbow marshmallows; a hot plate of Campbell's chicken and rice, and a sandwich; watching The dukes of Hazzard and at the end the classical "Friday night, movie presentation", of which I never saw the end 'cause I usually fell asleep. Those were the days!  Now thanks to DVD, I'll get my "The Dukes of Hazzard: the complete first season" and remember those days... Xmas, what a feeling!    urlLink    ...&nbsp; urlLink
William Knudsen      There's nothing more pretty than not having to rush into your e-mail account just hoping not to have it full. The new movement that Gmail started pushed Yahoo Mail! and then MNS to improve their mail storage. Now I have almost 2G storage if I add all my accounts. The rush will be "finding a way to use all that storage" ... Will be this the time to start embracing Bulk mail? Mmmm, ha, yeah r
