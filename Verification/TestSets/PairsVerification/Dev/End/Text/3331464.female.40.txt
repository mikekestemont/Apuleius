Bunch of oregano, chopped finely Bunch of parsley, chopped finely salt and freshly ground pepper to taste  Heat 3 T olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat, add the onions and garlic, and saute for 3 mins. Add the peppers, eggplants and zucchini; mix well and cook for 5 mins or until the vegetables have gained a little color. Then add the tomatoes, 1 2/3 cup of water, the oregano, parsley, salt and pepper; mix well and simmer gently for 1 hour, stirring from time to time. Stir in remaining 6 T of olive oil and check the seasonings. Serve hot or at room temperature.   Comments   This was really good. Some recipes say that you must saute all the vegetables separately first and then put them together. I found this to be easier and very good. The eggplant did not absorb to much liquid. It is possible to use canned tomatoes too. We had some left over and it was great the next day. I added some salt (I noticed several of my guests added salt to all the food) and some more oregano (dried this time) and some herbs de Provence. It made it better. I think more garlic next time too. Overall a great dish. Unfortunately my husband and stepson don't like zucchini, eggplant etc so I won't be making it often.        My French Kitchen : A Book of 120 Treasured Recipes
Original recipe from  My French Kitchen : A Book of 120 Treasured Recipes  called for cherries  1 T unsalted butter, at room temp, for the dish (in a hurry, used Pam) 1.5 lbs red rasperries 3/4 cup plus 2T all purpose flour 1/3 cup sugar 3 lg eggs 1 1/4 cup milk 1 t vanilla extract confectioners' sugar, for serving (I found I was out at the last minute)  Heat oven to 350 deg F. Butter a shallow oven proof dish (I used a 13 by 9 lasagna pan, I think it was too big, the clafoutis was very thin). Spread raspberries in the dish. Put the flour and sugar in a large bowl, mix together. In another bowl, whisk the eggs; add the milk and vanilla and whisk to combine. Slowly pour the liquids into the dry ingredients, beating constantly until all the liquid has been added and you have a smooth batter. Pour over the raspberries. Bake for 40 mins, until the batter is firm to the touch and golden on top. Sift with confectioners' sugar on top and serve just warm (it had cooled to room temp by the time I served it).   My comments   Overall it was an easy recipe and the cake? doesn't distract from the fruit and it is not too sweet but I didn't love it and it didn't get raves. Maybe it was because I used the wrong dish. Because it is so classic and easy, I will try it again.
