necessities; 1.75 Liters of "Southern Comfort", Black and Milds, Cigars, Swisher Sweets, Marlboro Reds, and of course 4 hilarious people all crammed in my little bedroom.  Duane is the coolest guy I know, hands down. I think he is awesome and he is even more amazing as you get more alcohol into his system. He never got drunk last night, in fact he was the soberest out of all of us. But I must say that the more alcohol he had the better the sex got. But I'll get to that in a minute!  Ricardo is my best friend. He is hilarious. I didn't think he would actually drink as much as he did..... Sean drank less than him but in a shorter amount of time. Whereas, Ricardo had about 15 shots over the course of about 6 hours. He was kind enough though to give me and Duane our space though.  As I said earlier the more alcohol we consumed the better the sex got. Ricardo said that if we wanted he could leave and play on the internet while we did "whatever" so we gladly took him up on the offer, twice. Ricardo later confided in me that hile we were in there and he was sitting here drunk off his ass he kept thinking "Damn, she's quiet!" lmfao. I will never forget how Duane after the second time we had sex said "Wow, I need something to smok after that." I will never forget how calm and peaceful he looked while we sat around smoking. He took a long drag on his cigar and said "The sex was amazing. The sex was fucking amazing!" and Ricardo responding "Yeah, I heard that..." lmao. That is what friends are for.  Sean turned out to be pretty cool. I didn't really know him, but it turned out alright in the end. I would definetly drink with him again. He is hilarious when intoxicated. His most memorable moment was when he drank a shot, looked at the glass started to do nother but changed his mind at the last minute and drank propel instead, which he immediately chased with 4 more shots. It was his idea to order pizza... So we ordered from Marco's and an hour he was like "Dude, it's been an hour... you should call." All turned out well though. We paid the pizza guy and gave him an 80 cent tip which he seemed really pissed about. Oh well, fuck him. Sean unfortunately had to leave early, I felt bad that he couldn't stay longer but oh well.  The whole night was amazing and I can't wait to do it again. Only next time we need more alcohol, more women (for Ricardo), some weed and we should be set. As Ricardo, Duane, and I sat down to drink our last shot each, Duane proposed a toast which I think summd the night up perfectly. "Here's to the end of our summer, great friendships, and wonderful events like this. Oh yeah, and more women for Ricardo! Cheers"  The E
