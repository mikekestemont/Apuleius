do you know his name?”  I asked, with great curiosity.  I am waiting for it.  “Oh, well it’s on the tag on his collar” Oh the revelation, how do you think it got there lady, yep that’s right I, his owner, bought it for him, so I am aware it’s there, still not fully answering the question though.  So I wait…  “Oh and as I live across the road from you in the (add description of your choice here) house, I see him though your fence and I go up and pat him and say hello, I take my grandkids over to visit him too and my daughter sometimes says hi and pats him.  Jesus lady, get your own dog.  By now I am a little pissed, for a bit of background Max is a Golden Retriever, he is the most docile dog on the planet and he looks like a little Golden Bear, very cute.  He barks when people walk past the house (at night) and would smother anyone with affection if they were to crossover into his domain.  But she doesn’t know that and I am pissed because she has been trespassing, on a somewhat regular basis to say hello to my dog.  Unjustified in my pissedoffedness, maybe but here is why I am pissed at this situation.  Firstly she walks through my front yard past the house to the back fence, reaches through the fence to pat my dog.  Now if my dog was to, oh I don’t know, bite that bitch all of a sudden it would become my problem.  She, if she chose to could press charges against me or sue me and I would be ordered to put Max down as a dangerous dog (this thought does not please me).  My recourse against her, basically nothing, trespass perhaps.  Now I would never, I repeat never go up to a foreign dog, who incidentally is behind a fence in someones back yard, no matter what bred, to pat them, never. I am pissed she would do this to me.  I can’t do anything about it as I am at work in the day and I can’t stop her.  I didn’t want to be a rude bitch by telling her to stay the fuck off my property although I wanted to, as she does after all live just across the road, and as she is retired can keep her beady little eyes on my house and stop those nasty burglars from stealing my shit (she is after all a constant visitor apparently anyhow).  So there you have it, my stalemate with the neighbour.  I do hope one day Max tries to take a piece of her, although it’s very unlikely, as he is now familiar with her as she has visited so often.  It still makes me mad though.  Oh and the walk?  She talked to me for half and hour before finally letting us go.  Max and I walked for another hour and when we got home it was dark.  So much for our daylight r
