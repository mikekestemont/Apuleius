sorry.  I'm a big scaredy cat.  Somebody should have woken me up!!!"  And they'd be all like, "She's holding us back man....feed her to the zombies.  She's cute and all and we want to reproduce with her but she's scared all the time and she keeps breaking into people's houses!"  Did you see that movie that came out recently? I think it was Dawn of the Dead or the Day After or something....it was the one where they were trapped in the Mall and decided to make a break for it by tricking out some armored trucks they found in the basement garage.  My question to you is...if by the end of the movie they'd figured out that zombiism was spread by zombie bites...why oh why didn't they wear protective suits.  They were in a mall...are you trying to tell me they couldn't find a long sleeve shirt, for goodness sake.  A sweater.  Wrap a thick floor mat around your arms...anything.  And what about when they landed on the island....wait a second before getting off the boat!!  Zombies aren't very smart.  They'll come out of hiding soon enough.  There was no need to get eaten by the zombies!!   Zombie movies are cool.     And in other news.  I need to start working on looking for a date.  Match.com here I come.  Maybe.   Well, I have to go to sleep now.  Must be fresh for my sucky job.  My job is starting to suck like a zombie sucks brains out of stupid mall people who wear tank tops and shorts when they escape.  They're making me do all sorts of secretay type stuff.  I'm a secretary but the stuff they are asking me to do are things that women did back before we had computers and email.  I mean come on folks.  People dictated because typing letters themselves was not time effecient (that's why I'd dictate a letter).  Its different in 2004.  These days by the time you dictate, proof read, edit, etc. etc. you could have done it yourself.  As a secretary I work on creating the intranet at my job and writing booklets for advertising their classes.  Its interesting and challenging.  Typing dictation isn't interesting at all.  Other things I hated doing at my previous job that I'm afraid they will ask me to do at this job which will make me quit are things like getting muffins and coffee.  "They didn't put the special sauce on my sandwich.  I can't eat this.  Would you get me another sandwich?"  Hey lady, its a meeting.  You didn't come here to enjoy the food...you came to meet and the food is a nice little benefit.  Get the sauce on your own time.  Please pray for me.  Pray that my job won't turn into one of those 1950's get me my coffee black with extra sugar jobs or that I'll have the courage to tell them they could put me to work in a more efficient, productive manner.  That I won't tell them to fuck off.   Thank you.  I'll write again soon. December B
