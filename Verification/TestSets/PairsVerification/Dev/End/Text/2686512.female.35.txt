there was this woman who came to work at my old office . . . she was a tad older than i, and she had a very friendly and warm personality. we seemed to have a lot in common. we shared lunches & shopping trips &amp; a good laugh now and then.  she had made a more-than-a-co-worker gesture during the first few weeks of her employment, and i thought that perhaps a friendship was developing.  i began to extend personal invitations to her (not something i normally do - being an intensely private person & afraid of strangers) i.e. if i knew her husband was away on business, i would invite her down for movies &amp; popcorn, or out for dinner. she repeatedly blew off my invitations, until finally i asked if she was ever interested in a friendship outside of work. after much hemming & hawing, she admitted that she only wanted a friendly-professional relationship. i stopped extending the invitations, and we continued with (what i had thought was) a lovely professional relationship.  when i accepted the new job offer, she acted surprised and sad.  i thanked her for making my work environment a more pleasant place and wished her well.  before i left, i wrote on a future page in her daily calendar "i've been gone a week - give me a call or drop me a line :)"  fast forward to last friday, a month and a half into the new job. i had dinner with Miss C from the old office. she told me that that woman had reached that page in her calendar, walked up to Miss C and said, "i'm not calling her; i'm not into her like that."    whatever that meant.    what it meant to me was that i had misjudged yet another person's character. i was disappointed, but not permanently damaged. i expressed my disappointment to my friend, and then moved on to other topics of conversation. it was a LOVELY time.  this morning i received an email from Miss C - "call me when you get this."   that woman's husband had a heart attack over the weekend.   i sent that woman an email extending prayers &amp; support, because that's the kind of person i am. after sending that email, i counted my blessings and returned to the mail merge i was working on. Miss C sent me an email, and we have, by turns, mused over the great cosmic "why" and the wonders of the office e
