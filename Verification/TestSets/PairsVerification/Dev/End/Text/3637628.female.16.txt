that night eighteen months ago when KATIE called him a baby because she cracked a joke and he threw a hissyfit.   I didn't get in trouble, and it wasn't that big of a deal, but for about half an hour i was thouroughly confused.  when we actually bought the couches, i was also thoroughly shocked.  before i continue, i should explain that me and my sister play a game (i'm the best at it) in furniture stores.  One of us points out a piece of furniture, and the other has to identify what piece of literature it bests belongs in, where specifically, and why.  Yeah, we're dorks.  so my mom had been very keen on this red patterned couch, it was very griffindor common room, covered in these kind of gold emblems and patterned with other faded color diamonds (patterns are HARD to describe)  Well, i didn't much care for it, but its partner was a tan number that i thought was stunning, so that was at the top of our list.  as we walked for a final check upstairs (to see if we missed anything before we bought them) katie pointed out these blue checked ones for me to identify.  It was very obvious that they belonged in maycomb county, in the living room of one atticus finch.  we kept walking, and after the vomit-plaid-don't-make-fun-of-purchases-blamed-for-katies-outburst, i found myself back at the blue couches!!  My parents loved them and took them home dat veery dai (said amerigo bonasera style)  Ah, it has been almost an hour since i started this post, and i am sleepy.  i don't wanna be cranks for the big shots tomorrow, so i'm going to bed.   The only other things of intrest that happened to me this week were not that interesting, except for the notice at the bottom of the page.  Well, once we met a squib at walmart (he stirred the paint for my room) and me and katie made a wand for matt for his birthday, but other than that, nada.    I promise i'll write about the bigshots after they leave manana.  In the meantime, visit a newly reactivated btothethird and LEAVE SOME COMMENTS.  if you don't keep up the record of at least 5 comments a post, i won't post until there are 5 comments.   jess    *****Movie update******  we have written a script and animated a production company logo.  This movie is NOT the ice cream sherpa movie (though i am in the midst of writing a script, four pages down, w00t)  this is a flash cartoon-turned webcomic-turned short film that me and katie star in.  It all stemmed from a discussion we had about pancakes, but i will tell you no more.  ok, i'll tell you two more things.  1. We need a site to host it on, so you may not see it until then  2. It doesn't have what some movie coinesseurs would call a 'plot' seeing as it was a comic at one point.  the plot is loose, but we're planning to make it more of an episodial t
