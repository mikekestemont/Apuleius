and go to the store to grab some snacks for a day of relaxing @ home since the heat makes doing almost any activity unbearable. So I get ready to sign onto AOL and for some inexplicable reason, it keeps saying my network connection is failing. So after several failed attempts, I wait until my moms comes home and informs her of the problem. So she calls AOL Tech Support 11 times in a row!!!! I kid you not!! We inform of the problem each time and they give me almost 11 different solutions. After the 11th failed attempt, I give up and call it a night. This morning, we call ATS again and tell them what’s happening and I’m informed that my modem keeps dropping out and it’s a defect with the modem and I’d have to call the manufacturer and get them to fix it. Now I realize this has to be a wrong answer since the modem does dial the access number, it just won’t connect to the service. So at this point, I’m pissed off as can be and extremely worried about the status of my online life (I’m a PC junkie). So I try to take my mind off things.     I go out to lunch with my friends and have some great food and good conversation. Then I go home to burn a couple CD’s for my friend and then it’s off to her B-B-Q. Still full from lunch, I play a couple games for a couple hours and then we all grub on some excellent food. Then we play some insanely fun party games that will be a staple at my parties for years to come. Finally, the party ends and I come home. My sister calls and my moms informs her of the problem with the PC and my sister tells me to do a System Restore with XP and go back to the day before the problem occurred. Whaddya know? It fixed the problem and I signed on with no problem. So I’m officially back online and the happiest boy in the world!! And it amazed me how my sister knew more about how to fix the problem than the people that created the software!!!!       And there’s not a prejudice bone in my body so don’t let anyone take this out of context but isn’t there something shady about the fact that out of the 11 service reps I talked to, 8 of them were foreigners? I promise you, I dealt with 8 different accents. I just thought how interesting it was that foreigners were hired to maintain American products. And don’t get me started on how you have to talk to 5 separate recordings until you get to a real live person!! So even though I’m officially anti-AOL and will cut them loose the minute we get Verizon DSL in October, I’m still ecstatic over the fact that my Internet is back. Got 2 go. Got some online homework to catch up on.        Current Eargasm -->   TLC  -  “What About Your F
