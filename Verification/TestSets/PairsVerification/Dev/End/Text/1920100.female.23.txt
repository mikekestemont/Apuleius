Center Edwards but to our misfortune it was also closed... So we came home. We decided next time we would go to the movies straight after bible study.    Earlier today   I spent the day with my friend and looked at curriculum and all the stuff we have to get ready before the school year begins. All I have to say is WOW I have so much work ahead of me. I pray that God guide me and provide me with patience and grace to tackle all that is ahead.     Upcoming Plans    We are thinking of going swing dancing...I am still thinking about  this. We are also getting together on Saturday and going to the movies.
Quick Note:    Tonight we didn't have a usual life group meeting. Angela, Adela, Danielle, Tinamarie, Vince and I headed out to Calvary Chapel in Costa Mesa to their worship night. It was awesome! The place got packed. The worship and teaching was good. It was amazing to see some people receive christ. Keep them in prayer.The ride and fellowship was good too!!=) We were going to go watch the movie the notebook afterwards but Danielle got a call that one of her friends broke her collar bone so she went to go visit her. It was cool though because on the way back we were driving on the 605 N comming home and they started talking about the bingo club right off of south st. I shared that my dad works there and Vince was like so you know where San Pedro's Tacos is??? which is a taco restaurant across the street. And I was like YES! So we were driving and I was like you want to go??? And everyone was like YEAH!! so instead of going to the movies we had dinner there!! It was yummy and we were just chattting. I had a good time!!! Well I am tired I will hollar at ya'll later Good night  God Bless you all.
Retreat at Palm Springs Update
These words I speak to you are not incidental additions to your life, homeowner improvements to your standard of living. They are foundational words, words to build a life on. If you work these words into you life, you are like a smart carpenter who built his house on solid rock. Rain poured down, the river flooded, a tornado hit--but nothing moved that house. It was fixed to the rock. But if you just use my words in Bible studies and don't work them into your life, you are like a stupid carpenter who built his house on the sandy beach. When a storm rolled in and the waves came up, it collapsed like a house of cards." ( Matthew 7:24-27 / Message Bible)  Jesus desires the same for us today. He wants our lives to be anchored in Him so that we can weather any storm.
Just A   QUICK   Note I am back in town. The retreat was   AWESOME  !!! I am too tired I will give you an update tomorrow (God willing). God Bless you all! Besos y a
