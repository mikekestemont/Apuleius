dealing with children  and animals  Depok, October 25, 2001 1:35 AM                                                               DREAM   I was in the middle of laughter and conversations trying to make sense  of what I wanted to see I wanted to feel  I sought for a soul so old that I knew well  he turned and smiled mouthed 'don't you worry I'll be there to hold your heart' then he walked away without waving or crying  next thing I knew I woke up  with the worst hang-over  which was an emptiness inside my chest  Depok, October 29, 2001 11:53 PM                                                               THUNDERBOLT   She started to lock her bedroom door since she piled up secrets  up in her womb  Not that I care so much but her world is not hers entirely she keeps many things  things that don't belong to her  exclusively and a lot will be going on  without her   She still thinks  the universe is for keep She has a hard time understanding that she's not alone she's just lonely  Depok, October 31, 2001 11:08 AM                                                               REVERIES   I don't sell anything that I don't claim I'm offering nothing that you cannot handle if you're not happy with the things that you see in me you can always walk away because I need every space that I can get stay far so I'll be able to feed my brains with melodies and rhymes from ancient scholars  or new age generation  I want to soar beyond this time and place sing complicated heartaches in glamorous cities  I'll write twisted tales and contorted characters then sold them to the highest kisser last but not least I will exploring the world map leave a mark of myself on every inch of this planet  I'm a dreamer so if you see me all alone humming unusual songs  whispering to myself  or stuck my head on yellowing pages just look away and go quietly I might be in a deep sleep   Depok, November 1, 2001 1:52 AM                                                               DEVOTED   I've lost all energy all the will to even think I never thought  being in a relationship  for too long can be so overwhelming not that I don't love you anymore I just lost a little bit  of interest  Jakarta, November 22, 2001   SPLIT   Is it true  that breaking up  is contagious?  Like yawning or chicken pox  or laughter  Why is it  that something so damaging has a right to spread its influence?   Because I can't help  feeling so down hearing the sound of a broken hope  Specially when I personally grow that hope  Depok, December 5, 2001 10:35 AM  Hang in there Dit!    REFLECTION   I have doubts again whether or not  I could trust you  with my whole life  Why?  Because you cannot accept that I'm sensitive that I tend to cry when I'm hurt that I made you look bad  Honey, I thought that loving  means taking everything as it is the good and the bad the high and the low  If you told me to be more reflective have you seen yourself  in the mirror  lately?
