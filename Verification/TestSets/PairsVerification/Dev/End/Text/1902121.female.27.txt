where they test how much weird shit one person can possibly take. But nope. I get out of the chair, walk into the waiting area, and the receptionist says, “OK, so we’ll see you in six months!”  The rational side of me, the side that doesn’t like idiots in positions where they can inflict pain, the side that doesn’t like to be kissed on the forehead by random fucking strangers, that's the side that knew I should’ve just walked out and never, ever set foot in that place again. But the other side, the side that loves a good story said, “Yup. See ya in February,” and walked out the door.
I’m not some peace-loving, “why can’t everyone get along”-asking, patchouli-stink-leaving, hippy girl who thinks that the solution to world peace is getting everyone to love each other. In fact, the word I use most often when describing people is suck. But know what? My misanthropic tendencies don’t stop me from having manners. I usually say please, I always say thank you, and if someone takes the time to smile and say hello to me, I will almost always return the greeting.   I was having a discussion with a friend yesterday about why I feel so isolated. In part, he placed the blame on the city I live in. I grew up in Boston so I know how it is. I know the people here are atypically guarded. But I decided to see just how bad it really was. I set out on a mission yesterday. I walked from Union Square in Somerville to Central Square in Cambridge and then up and down Mass Ave – round trip I probably walked about 5 miles. During the entire walk I tried to make eye contact with people. I had a smile on my face the whole time – trying to get the same out of at least one person. At best, I got a handful of half smiles, but most people just turned their heads in order to avoid the eye contact.   So what gives Cambridge? Is it really that hard to return a smile? It doesn’t take much energy. I’m not looking to start a conversation. No time is wasted. You have nothing to lose. When I was in Honolulu I returned a smile from a stranger on the street and several hours later we were skinny dipping on Waikiki Beach. It was one of the most impulsive, fantastic nights of my life (and no, there was no sex involved), and it was all initiated with a smile.   I know this is a new concept up here so I’m going to give the people of Cambridge some slack. But I’m going to keep doing this walk until I get a better response. I’m going to make this city more polite if it kills me. So if you see some asshole girl with a giant grin on her face staring at you – don’t be afraid. Just fucking smile back. I swear it won’t kill you. Who knows? You might even enjoy i
