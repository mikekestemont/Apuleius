happy that he has such high hopes on me, but must he tell everyone or not... Nevermind. say whatever he wants.  After dinner we went to a disco pub. It was nice, but the crowd is abit old (hang out with old men, what to expect. haha) Then Melissa told me that a fat man next to us while ordering drinks at the bar told her that he loves me! so funny, and he was yakking 'Chinatown Chinatown' to her. hahah... Then the night proceed on quite ok, danced with the SG ppl, and at the dance floor a young boy wanted to get to know me. Why do i keep attracting the WRONG ppl?  Went to Leblon and stayed for the weekend at Sam's apt. There was porn channel. Of cos watched it (a bit only huh, just to see why the males are so fascinated about it). so gross. just like animals.
IT IS FINALLY OVER.  Finally, after 11 days of negotiation, the deal with a Canadian company is finally closed. they have been asking alot of conditions... wat a pain to deal with them. it was quite ugly for a while, cos the supplier was fed up when we keep changing our mind on what we promised them (well have to thank superman for that.. he agreed without thinking and later when boss don't agree, we have to turn them down). Superman practically gives in to them most of the things. and i have to clean the shit. haiz. Boss isnt too happy we took so long, and gave in to them.  but learn alot alot on the legal things in the contract. thanks to my SG colleague who has been so patient to help us. we do have a pretty brazilian legal advisor here, but other than being pretty and distracting to the supplier and have a very fantastic mouth.. eh, not much other things i can comment on.  moved to this new office at Gloria where many he-she appeared at nite. so ugly. our changi gals put them to shame. now i have to walk 15 mins to a post office near the old office. life is always like that, until u lose something, u won't appreciate the presence.
8 Aug 04  Happy National Day Singapore! The SG-ppl in Brazil meet up at Tijuca, the Chinese restuarant at People's association at 1pm (which would be 12am 9 Aug 04 SG time).

Well i bpught only 1 top and a pair of jeans for myself. got something for my mom and auntie and a couple of friends.. and that is all. not my style maybe. but the clothes' quality is really quite good and it is really quite cheap. The bikini is cheap and looks really nice too, for the good quality they provide... will get a couple the next time i am there. h
