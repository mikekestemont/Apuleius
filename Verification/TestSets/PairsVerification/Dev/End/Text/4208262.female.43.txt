still somewhat cold. Our water stopped as I was filling the bathtub. But at least, we could use that water to flush our toilet. Next I rushed around gathering up tea lights and candles and placing them where I could find them easily.   Bryce went downstairs at 5:30 to meet Melissa and moments later they both appeared. Melissa was beat red from walking all the way home and then climbing the stairs to our apartment. It seems that her friend’s mom refused to give Melissa a ride home. I’m not sure how a mother could do that. I know that I WOULD not have done that in any circumstance. I was happy that we were all safe and sound in our little haven. Safe from the craziness outside.  Then the boredom settled in. What do you do without the internet, music, tv, cooking devices, water, a refrigerator? Within an hour all three of us were sound asleep hoping with all our might that when we woke up the nightmare would be over.  It wasn’t though. Melissa and I woke up around 10:00 and sat outside on the balcony marveling at the darkness of the city, the stars that we can never see otherwise and the screaming of tires as young punks raced the dark streets in their sports cars. We talked about a lot of different things. Took the time to laugh and commiserate like we haven’t in years and as I looked at my grown up baby I was proud. Proud of all that she has become and proud of our relationship. This is what a little darkness can bring. It brought a lot of light to my world, by slowing things down enough to bring us back to the basics, life, love and family.

I was home early from work today and decided to zone out in front of the TV.  I am not familiar with any of the programs on at that time, so I numbly sat flicking the remote looking for something interesting to spark my curiousity.  There were those "justice" shows, old "friends" episodes, ancient "seinfeld's" and then, there she was, larger than life, Tammy Faye Baker, back on TV.  That sparked my curiousity.  Not for long though.  Why would I want to endure even 10 minutes of her and her new housemates, Vanilla Ice, Ron Jeremy, on Surreal Life?  Or for that matter, who else would?   I don't know about anyone else, but I can hardly stand to watch regular TV anymore.  It seems the only types of programs that are available en masse are real life crime shows, Judge shows or reality shows that typically highlight interpersonal relationship problems up close.  Where can a person go to escape reality?  That's what TV used to do for us.  Perhaps more people will return to reading as a perferable past time.  I know I h
