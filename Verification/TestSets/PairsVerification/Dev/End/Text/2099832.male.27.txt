the nature of the businesses that hire me to design for them they tend to be a bit more 'un-business-like' which suits me!      KK008 - Do you have a design business tip to share with other people trying to make it on their own?   My Build Design tip is to believe in yourself, try not to compromise the work you produce, in the end people will have more respect for you.    KK009 - How has the Build experience been? How has it differed from your time at The Designers Republic?   The Build experience has been the best thing I have ever done, I couldn't go back and work for someone else now. It's the best feeling. Build differs from The Designers Republic in a lot of ways, for one [and the best] it's my baby! tDR was great, Build is better!              KK010 - The  urlLink Computerlove International Graphic Design Exhibition  in Brussels was amazing. What did you do in your role as curator? Do you plan to do collaborative exhibitions like this again in the future?    Thanks. I really enjoyed doing that with the Computerlove crew, they are such a brilliant people to work with, so much enthusiasm for the design community [I have made some good friends from my involvement with that project]. My role was to design the identity/feel of the space, and as guest artist. I feel very proud of this exhibition, it was the first time that I was asked to exhibit our work as Build so it will always have a special place in my heart.  I would love to do something similar for someone else, I enjoyed designing for a space rather that for an area of paper, it throws up it's own challenges and presents itself with some interesting opportunities.    KK011 - Do you see yourself walking a fine line between 'fine artist' and 'applied artists'? If so which side of that line would you say you are on?   I would say that I am on the side of the 'applied artist', I never lose sight of the fact that I am designing 'for someone', that's the bottom line. As I said before I have been very fortunate to have the clients I have, who have been kind enough to let me loose on their products.     KK012 - Tell me  urlLink Two Things  about Michael Place.   The Two Things about Michael C. Place: 1) I would like to open a shop that sells only Crisps [Chips, from around the World], the shop is called 'Crisp'.  2) The 'C' stands for Christopher.    ***Minutia: At the moment, what's your favorite...
