 Bush was in the National Guard during that time.  While maybe not as glamorous as going to war, it's unfair for liberals to portray Bush as a rich kid who avoided the draft.   Q)  John Kerry will further polarize this nation.  He was rated the #1 most liberal Democrat in the Senate and his partner, Edwards, was rated #4.  This is the most liberal Democratic ticket ever.    Okay, those are my thoughts.  Enjoy.  If you don't like what I have to say, I challenge you to research it and respond.
When you think of the domestic environment, probably one of the first things you think about are the decline of our forests, the size of landfills, and how so very little of it is being recycled.    The truth is (as reported by the American Forest & Paper Association (AF&PA):  -In 2003, 49.3 million tons, or 50.3% of all paper consumed in the US is now being recycled- up from 33.5% in 1990.   -In 2003, recycling of cardboard boxes (OCC) rose to a record high of 75.8%. -In 2003, 73% of all Old Newspapers (ONP) were recycled. -Recovery of office papers increased to 48.3% last year, an all time high. -Americans recycle 270 million pounds of paper every day (roughly 49 million tons a year). -Every ton of paper recovered for recycling saves 3.3 cubic yards of landfill space.  This means almost 162 million cubic yards were spared from our landfills.   -Recycling continues to increase throughout the nation and is showing no signs of slowing down.    -I read on http://textonly.mde.state.md.us/Programs/LandPrograms/Recyling/index.asp that every ton of paper recycled will save up to 24 trees, each 40' tall.  This means that up to 3,888,000,000 trees were spared last year because of recycling.  In other words folks, our domestic trees and forests are in no real danger of being lost forever.    But the biggest truth Liberals don't want you to know about is this:   Liberals want you to think that the hard work, sacrifice and concern from environmentalists is what's causing recycling to grow.  This is not true.  Recycling works and continues to improve because EVERYONE makes money.  The public recycles and they receive money.  The recycler makes money because he sells the material to mills.  Mills make money because recycled material is cheaper than virgin material.  Printers, bottle makers, and can makers save money because recycled material lowers their overall expenses.  Plus, recycling companies purchase the waste paper, plastic, glass, and aluminum from commercial and industrial businesses, adding to their revenue.  The end consumer benefits again because lowered production expenses, lowered trash expenses (resulting from recyclables being diverted from the waste stream), and revenue received from selling recyclables to recycling companies help lower the prices consumers pay for goods.    Making money is the only thing that is going to save the environment.  That's the problem I have with toothless environmentalists:  They spend all their time concerned about the problem without thinking of innovative, money-making systems for improvement.  Instead, the best they do is create costly industrial restrictions.  They therefore, are a hinderance to their own c
