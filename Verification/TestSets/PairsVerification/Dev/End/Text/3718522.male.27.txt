physically couldn't move at top speed. After an hour of this we ended up being sent up a line which was supposed to be closed, so we stuck outside a station for an hour until we were cleared to go back. Then, just as we started to move, the power went off because another train had hit something thrown from ours and the entire line's power had tripped.  At this point people started getting out of our train and walking up the track to the station to order taxis. Unfortunately this delayed us further because they obviously couldn't switch the power back on while people were on the track. The driver told  people not to do this but his advice was vigorously ignored for a long time. Then there was a battle to get all the doors closed again - people were naturally reluctant to close them because it was so hot, but we couldn't move with them open because it was unsafe.   Finally, after two hours of no movement, we set off again and eventually made it to Croydon where the train company provided bottles of water to the passengers. Just before the train was due to leave for its final leg, however, the driver came on the intercom and begged for assistance; some old dear had decided to go and assault him, meaning that our train finally got cancelled while the police came to drag her off.   Another late train thankfully pulled in at that point, so we all piled onto that one. Finally we made it to Victoria at gone 4, having left at 11.  The thing that got me was that most of the delays (bar the being sent up the wrong line in the first place) were a direct result of the staggering stupidity of my fellow passengers. Throwing things from the train, refusing to listen to the driver and then going and attacking him displayed such a staggering level of fuckwittage I think a heavy meteor strike on this planet would be very good for the universe as a whole.  So this year the plan is to have a leisurely journey down on Friday, stay in a hotel and head back on Sunday.   Much better.
No posts for a week? Have I suddenly lost interest in the blogging phenomenon?  Nah. Just been hugely busy. Largely I was training clients last week - a role I love since it inevitably brings with it high levels of performance fatigue, flying by the seat of my pants as I field new and interesting questions and at the same time having to cover my normal support role as well.   Ugh. Hateful.  Then there was the archery (steadily improving), two leaving do's (one work colleague, one friend), computer troubles (mine and other people's), CD creation and cover design for a friend's birthday, attendance at a  urlLink marvellous party  for said friend, and then getting slowly mashed on Pimms, Bucks Fizz and white wine in my aunt's back garden whilst sunbathing shamelessly.  Yes, it's all been go.  No wonder I'm sodding t
