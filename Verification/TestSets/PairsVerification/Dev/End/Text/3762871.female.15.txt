18 days till I see my baby again.... I miss dan so bad... I wrote a poem thingy the other day.....  "forever" no sound, but the beating of your heart and soft breath my head lies so close to your chest I can smell your sent I close my eyes and think of else ware for I can feel your presence I dream we are among a dark silent forest in a tent reality brings me a kiss as your lips touch mine the softness of your hair tingles through my fingers with joy and sorrow If I ever lost you I question forming a frown, remembering our first kiss brings a grin I hold you tighter, I never want to let you go for I want to see you tomorrow  I also made a song I as you can see I have been thinking bout him alot  "dont go away" I dont know why u always bring a smile on my face I dont know why I want to be with you any time or place I dont know why but your always seem to make me laugh but I like it and I dont want it to go away dont let it rought away cause I want to be with you I want you to know how I feel Its so hard to believe this is real I dont know why u always bring a smile on my face I dont know why I want to be with you anytime or place I dont know why but your always seem to make me laugh but I like it and I dont want it to go away I hope you feel the same dont play me like a game I hope that we will last so I can put my pain in the past I dont know why u always bring a smile on  my face I dont know why I want to be with you anytime or place I dont know why but u you always seem to make me laugh I love you and I dont want it to go away  It was my Birthday yesturday... and my grandparents took me to the movies and to get my make up done at Dillards.... but the make ups so exspensive.... ahhhhhhhhhhhhh alright all I can say is that I really miss dan more then ever...... :( I cant even really think to type much of anything else too much on my m
