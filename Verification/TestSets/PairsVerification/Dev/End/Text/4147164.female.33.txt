for the next session. I leave undecided and figure I’d play it by ear.
Had plans on Friday evening but I decided to take a nap before I went out.  Unfortunately, I am one of those people who _cannot_ set a timer for nap-taking.  If I do, I toss and turn, stressing out, wondering if I'll be able to actually fall asleep before the alarm goes off.  So, I optimistically got into bed at 6:15, thinking that I'd wake up in time to still enjoy my Friday.  But noooooooooooo....woke up at 2AM, my entire Friday GONE.  Now, I'm just killing time until the rest of the world wakes up.  This sucks :P
I have so many thoughts running through my head that I’d like to write about, yet so little time to actually commit any of these ideas to my blog! Unfortunately, it’s too difficult to type while holding a Bud Light and a lit cigarette…  But, here’s a thought that keeps returning over and over again…Outback Jack. Is he the quintessential male or what? Sensitive (he cries!) and yet rugged at the same time. I actually saw him snack on an ant’s ass a few shows ago. Now that’s a REAL man.  If Natalie and he ever split, I’ll happily make my home in the Outback. I could probably go on for many paragraphs about my attraction to Jack, but I'll refrain because I know not everyone is as enamored with him as I am...  Moving on... Last night after rowing with my crew, I went to Hoopple’s, one of my new favorite bars. They have a blues band every Thursday that is  amazing , and if you can ignore the singer’s tendency to preach from the stage, it’s really a great time. While I was there, I met the bass player, Gene.  Gene impressed me, because he strikes me as one of those few people who is actually living out his dream. He plays music and races cars for a living. What a life! He truly enjoys what he does, and really, how many of us can say that?  It got me thinking about how fulfilling life has the potential to be, if you find work that inflames your passion. Like, what would life be like if I actually woke up and felt enthused about coming to my job? If I couldn’t wait, because I really found meaning in what I did? Is sacrificing the almighty dollar worth it for workplace joy?  It’s a lot to think about. It’s kind of a moot issue at this point, as I have a kid and a mortgage right now. But, 15 years from now, I may have to seriously consider ‘dropping out’, living a very simple (i.e. poor) life that inspires me. Kudos to those of you who have already taken that big step. I’m still working on finding the courage to make that leap…
I am 'working' so I don't really have time to write anything right now.  However, I just wanted to get this set up.  I will be adding more l
