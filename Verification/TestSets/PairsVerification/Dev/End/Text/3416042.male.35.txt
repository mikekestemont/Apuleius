rather than coffee, since I have never like coffee, but like  wireless networking quite a bit.&nbsp; (There's my bag again.)&nbsp; I guess  I'll put the laptop away and go get my bag, which I figure will be coming around  in just a moment - you think?

It occurred to me  today while driving in my car that something that adds to whether or not I like  a particular song is whether or not the singer is singing in a key I can  reach.&nbsp; Yes, I sing along in my car.&nbsp; To me, I'm not that bad - your  opinion may vary.&nbsp; So I like music by Live or Staind or David Lee Roth  better than I might otherwise because they sing in a key that's natural to  me.&nbsp; I have to wonder if that's why (or an additional reason why) women  like women singers more than men do, for  example.
It's been a very busy week, except that when I've been home I've done little else this week except work on jigsaw puzzles.  I was anxious to complete one called "The Breath of Gaia" which I was working on as a gift for Roberto's daughter Gaia.  I had already finished the one intended for Giusseppe (I now realize I'm not precisely sure how to spell his name - ack!) that's of a fire wizard and glows under black light.  Roberto and Monica have been very good friends of mine for some time and I really love their kids, too.  Putting together a couple puzzles for the kids, then gluing them so they become artwork was something I got the idea to do awhile back, and I've finally had the opportunity.  I gave them to them yesterday, so it's okay to post here about it now.  I think Roberto reads my blog sometimes and I didn't want to spoil the surprise.  I haven't done puzzles for a long time, and I'm finding their still a lot of fun - more now that I am in the mode of thinking I'll glue them together so they are kept.  I have to decide if I'm up to the challenge of this huge puzzle I saw at Uncle's Games, a Ravensburger puzzle with 5000 pieces.  The largest I've completed that I remember is 1500, although I was close to finishing a 2500 piece puzzle once when Olympia and my parents tried to move it from the first floor to the basement of our house in Rockville and dropped it down the stairs.
OK, I found where the "villifying enemies" came from - it was a British psychoanalyst named Wilfred Bion who wrote about social interaction in the mid-20th century. He broke down group interaction into three basic areas or topics:   Engaging in flirtatious sex talk amongst pairs  Identifying and villifying enemies  Nominate and venerate a hero beyond critique   The next time you find yourself in a social group setting, take a moment to analyze what it is you're really talking about and see if it shows up in that very short l
