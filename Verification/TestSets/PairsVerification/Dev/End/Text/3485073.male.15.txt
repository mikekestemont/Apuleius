That's all for now!
Hey everybody! I don't have long, we're leaving for home right nmow, post when I get back, see ya!
The slogan on my T-shirt. Ok, this is gonna be a long one folks, so grab a drink and sit back. Here's the summary of the past week. Ok, when we first arrived, the place looked like shit on the outside (hence the title of the previous post). I thought my mom was gonna freak out and beat someone. But once we got over the outside and decided to step inside, we were pleasantly surprised. It turns out that they had comepletly redone the interior and just hadn't got around to the outside yet. We had a beautiful view of the beach and satellite tv (kev, i had G4 techtv there!). The beach was really cool, the tide goes out like a half kilometer. And there was a lot of very hot girls in bikinis on the beach. But away from my fantasies (for now). (Oh yeah, FYI: The name of this town we stayed in is Tatamagouche. We also went to PEI, that place is awsome! there was so much cool stuff. I picked up two cool T-shirts. My fav is the pirate on that says "beatings will continue until morale improves". The bridge to PEI is 12km long and we drove the whole thing. We took the ferry back over. The ferry had gambling machines on it. They didn't supervise them, they put people on the "honour system", big mistake (hehe). I gambled away happily and lost what i gained instead of stopping while i was ahead. We went to a mall in New Glascow. Thats where I picked up the shirt with the slogan "keep it real" on it. You need to see the shirt to get the slogan. Man, someone blew a skunk away the night before and it filled the house with the smell. I thought I was gonna die! We've seen these really cool things (i don't know what they're called). They're the amphibious things that are on the first tomb raider movie. Thats all for now, i'll finish this tomorrow. bye!
I'll explain the title later guys. I can't give much of an update right now, I'm on an express terminal and i have 10 minutes. I'm typing like wildfire right now. Mikaela, I swear to god that I've foung your long lost twin sister in a diner we ate at before we reached our destination. We were shocked when we reached the place we were staying at. The outside looks horrible, but once we got inside, it was amazing. The interior was just redone this year and they have yet to do the outside. I'm sorry I haven't updated earlier thatn this. Kev, I know you're probably wondering why don't I use my dail-up connection. Simple, long distance connection charges that I'm not willing to pay. I'll give you guys a really long and extensive post when we get to the hotel in Halifax at the end of the week, till then, b
