 2. Upgradation of Premium users of Hotmail and MSN will happen starting July and November respectively. 3. Users in US, UK, Japan, Australia, Canada, France, Germany and Spain will get their accounts upgraded by November. Remaining people (i.e. us in India) will be upgraded in following 12 months. A few users in US, UK and Japan will also get upgraded in late July.  Why is better than Yahoo: 1. More storage (100 MB versus 250 MB) 2. Security (Yahoo only scans while Hotmail cleans as well)  Why is it better than Gmail: 1. No protection from viruses.. so anybody could send you a virus and you will nver know till it has destroyed everything on your machine 2. No calendar or contact mangement functionality 3. No integration with Instant messaging (you can't see if a person is online or offline while you are writing an email. also known as presence management) 4. No integration with Mobile devices. (you can receive hotmail on mobile if you subscribe with the mobile service provider  Where hotmail can get beaten? 1. Anti-establishment sentiment 2. Yahoo has a great reliability record and has always provided more storage than hotmail :)  Email storage becoming a commodity (everybody has more than one email account). The real differentiator is in the reliability and value that your email accounts provides you in your daily activities!! Can someone beat the passport functionality built in with Hotmail accounts?
The list of blogs I read are ever growing and shrinking...  Thought would share the blogs I read.. Apart from the great blogs from Indian MVPs, I really like reading the Cnet blog (always first with tech news) and Microsoft Watch from Mary Jo (insider details)  I use SharpReader as my aggregator and have exported the blog list using "Export" functionality and the file has been created as an OPML file.  Find the OPML file  urlLink here .  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.
Well today morning someone asked me if they could access Microsoft newsgroups over Lotus Notes 5. Logically, there should be a way to access any newsgroup given NNTP is an standard and a very old protocol (giving enough time for implementation by various vendors). A little digging and here are the results of the same:  Lotus Notes 5 has support for accessing newsgroups. Earlier versions of Lotus seems to have only support for newsgroups hosted on Domino servers..   I found information at  urlLink The only information that you really have to enter is a friendly account name, which you determine for your own use, plus the server name (msnews.microsoft.com) and a protocol -- in this case, NNTP. Then, you save the account document and Notes adds a bookmark to your client. With Notes R5, the former Notes workspace is replaced by bookmarks, which provide a much faster way for getting to and managing information on desktops and the Internet. Once you click on your new NNTP bookmark, you can select from a list of newsgroups published by the server administrator, and you're on!  u
