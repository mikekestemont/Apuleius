the Bronze Star had been awarded instead. "To this day I still believe he deserved the Silver Star for his courage," he wrote. Rassmann described himself as a retired lieutenant with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. "I am a Republican, and for more than 30 years I have largely voted for Republicans," Rassmann said. But he said Kerry "will be a great commander in chief."  "This smear campaign has been launched by people without decency," Rassmann said. "Their new charges are false; their stories are fabricated, made up by people who did not serve with Kerry in Vietnam."

This is going to offend so many people...I'm sorta sorry :-) From the Onion, forwarded by my brother:  The Onion: What is funny?  Louis C.K.: Sometimes I ask myself questions. Other times I ask myself boxes of Kleenex. I'm sorry. Was that too stupid? Maybe it wasn't stupid enough.  All right, enough of the formalities. Let's get to the question at hand. What is funny? Well, you asked the right douchebag. I know exactly what funny is. Funny is when a fat lady walks around while someone plays the tuba. Once you've seen that, you'll never laugh at anything else. Except maybe a skeleton dancing around while someone plays the xylophone, which is almost exactly the opposite of a fat lady walking around while someone plays the tuba. Well, a skeleton is the opposite of a fat lady. But is a xylophone the opposite of a tuba? History will decide.  My father used to say "Nothing is funny unless I say it is." Then he would hit me really hard with his car, and he would laugh at me as I lay there dying. So I guess that was funny, because it made him laugh.  I guess the real question is what is funny to me. Well, that's easy. Jesus is funny to me. Why? Because He died for my sins and He didn't even know me. Man, what a retard.

Another reason to loathe organized, western religions.  So the kid can either eat the wheat-laden wafer and go to heaven after she croaks of her allergies, or she can skip the offering and go to hell.  Hrmmmmmm....  Some people have such power-issues.  This is like the guy who complained about the little girl trying to raise money from her lemonaide stand to fight cancer.  Who ARE these people and why are they not sent to an island somewhere and forced to live with one-another.    Fucktards.   urlLink WSOCTV.com - Family - Church Denies 8-Year-Old's Non-Wheat C
