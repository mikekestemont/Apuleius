the same day.  His song My Place with Jaheim is good.    Care to know what I've been up to?  I went to McDonald's with friends last night.  Kinda disappointed Paige didn't join us but that's cool.  I ate at some pretty cool places over the weekend.  Went to Edwardsburg to see my grandpa and ate at Lunker's.  Last Friday, I ate at Grand Empire.  Six or seven plates of food...awesome buffet!    I can't help but thinking that I had a great summer but I could've done more.  I don't want it to be over and I am sure everyone else feels the same.  But I think some good things will be happening soon so I won't worry about it too much.  I don't know how everyone else feels but if people are still reading what I wrote, then I want you to consider getting together either a week from this weekend or two weeks from this weekend.  I'd have no problem hosting it.  Just I need to hear from people.  Later
I wanted to just write about stuff I've been doing.  So that's what I am gonna do.  Let me start with the little stuff.  I saw some movies and so let me tell you about them.  Watched The Big Bounce.  It's cool, but not much happens in the movie (i liked the girl in the movie tho).  Watched Barbershop 2.  Good movie.  I like the first one more though and I think the world did too.  I went with my brother and dad and saw Anchorman again.  I think I laughed more than the first time.  That movie is great!  Alright...enough of that I got some new music that I discovered through CDNOW.com and my downloading software.  Downloaded some Taking Back Sunday and Yellowcard (Believe, Way Away, October Nights).  It's good.  I also downloaded some rap stuff.  Kanye West, Petey Pablo, Jay Z (99 problems is awesome), and of course Nelly's at the top.  Can't wait for that day in the future when he releases his two CDs on the same day.  His song My Place with Jaheim is good.    Care to know what I've been up to?
