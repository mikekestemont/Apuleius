write these books.  I never would have thought to think up this kind of stuff.  I have a pretty out there imagination too.  I don't exactly understand.  Maybe their parents were the same way and they just drilled it into their kids' mind.  I don't understand why they would do it though.  I would be happy if my kid were just plain reading.  I believe that if you talk to your child and they understand that it is not real, then you should let them read it.  I mean, I just don't really get it.  I understand that that is what some people believe, but is that the right way?   Am I wrong for reading those books?  What is right when it comes to these kinds of books?  What's wrong?
I just had a chance today to visit someplace that I thought I would never be.  I went to a school in the Kansas City district.  Now you may think, okay and what is so great about that?  Well, I will just tell you.  It was VERY different.  The school is mostly black populated.  I met a lot of the students.  I was very impressed.  That is not at all how I thought they would act, or how I thought things would go.  They acted exactly like I would have acted (most of them).  They were talkative, helpful, and didn't give much lip.  I imagined them a lot worse.  I just received a feeling first hand of how not to judge a book by it's cover.  It was sort of hard for me to walk into that school and meet them with an open mind.  I kept thinking that I would have to watch my back from what I heard of them.  They have a metal detector that you have to walk through when you first get into school.  It was scary to walk through.  You had to sign in and sign out and they had to know what you were doing, why you were there.  I was scared to death.  At first, everytime one of the students walked by me or was in my view, I was VERY cautious.  I had to keep my mind open though.  I found that if I stayed with Grant, I was fine.  So, ha ha, I stuck by grant the entire time of the first few hours.  I finally figured out that everything was okay and when I met a few of the people.  It was awesome to talk to them when they were going the same direction.  They are the exact same as you and me.  The only difference is that their ancestors were born a lot closer to the equator.  I don't know if that is what makes you black or not, but I was just throwing that in there.  Anyways, I just wanted to say, that all those times people say, don't judge a book by it's cover.  It's true.  Be open-minded.  You'll feel better in the long run and you might just move a step forward on your journey through l
