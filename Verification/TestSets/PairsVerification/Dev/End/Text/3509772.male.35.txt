yarning a wanting to full fill something?? This separate heart beat that pounded inside me or energy within was telling me to move forward.   What and why I couldn't work out. yet there was an internal calling but it was becoming a scream. So I started to look and what I was looking for I didn't know I wanted that black board to show me.
Were was I headed what was I looking for or maybe was I looking for something I already had?     Looking in to my existence? In the beginning I had a shallow view of the future and my existence. This view was influenced very much by commercial direction.  What I had to understand was my life was a journey, and a learning journey. What I was going to learn wasn't presented on any black boards or readable in any scriptures or manuscripts.   I had it in side me but to allow the lessons to emerge and humble me with there existence and directions is were the journey has it's storm's one thing that has certainly been shown to me is we have to listen or you will be made to listen!  Was I  strong enough to allow these lessons to be taught was I focused and wholly enough to see the lessons and step in the required direction.   Looking back it shows me many times when I feared to allow the messages to come through I feared being judged and I now realise the only judge was me.   I was a heavily one sided judge, I tried to maintain the so called  Normality  not looking into the general fear of the unknown.   What is normal and who can classify and describe normality and who decided on its boundaries??  An Easy answer used by all is society.  My question then is which society and which belief?
I went and saw TROY on the weekend and what stood out the most to me is how much we haven't changed through the thousands of years. In the movie we saw negotiation before the war and then war were they successfully killed hundreds of people.   When what we had and are doing is still doing take the Iraq issue, we saw the same thing negation of war and then the killing which we are still having. What makes us different to animals?  In my opinion its thought not instinct, yet we don't seem to want to utilize thought. It shocks me that we have a democratic society trying to change a dictatorship.   We should remember that IRAQ has been ruled by a dictatorship for thousands of years and when change occurs this should be taken into account.   We have so much death and destruction without thought we are able as a untied force to change these things. I feel the problem is we cant or don't want to unite and we don't even look at our own back yards before cleaning other societies back yards.  don't get me wrong a threat is a threat and most time force should be met with f
