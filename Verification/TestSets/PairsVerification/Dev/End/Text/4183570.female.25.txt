decline the offering of noon and request the latest slot available. She sighs and informs me that they prefer to do inspections in the morning. I sigh and reply that I prefer to deal with people who meet minimum IQ requirements, but obviously we don't always get what we want. She bestows upon me, like she is a queen and she is knighting a serf, the offer of 4pm. Fine. This is the best that I will get. Of course, this now means that everything has to be packed up, cleaned out (And you should see their freaking list of cleaning requirements), and pristine within the space of 6 hours. Fun. So this is what prompts me to wake up sweating in the night with the fear that I won't manage to pull it off, that no one I know will show up to help me load the truck, they all hate me and are glad that I'm leaving and that the boxes that I've packed already will somehow untape themselves in the night and then explode all over the house in a fireworks show of a mess and there I will stand amidst the debris and cacophony, just as the inspector arrives.

Regardless of the fact that it was 6AM, I woke him up so that he could tell me what happened. This is one of the many ways in which it is invaluable to have a partner in life. 3) Packing for the imminent move. As our move date fast approaches, I am simultaneously trying to donate/throw out/sell as much as I can part with, pack up the remainder, and see everyone in Southern California one last time before I flee the state (again). 4) Cleaning. Just because I always tack that one on to lists such as these. 5) Making breakfast. I haven't eaten yet. I think that this is the one that I'll do first. After this blog thing, of course.  So, why am I not doing any of the above mentioned projects? Because my friend Mara sent me an email about her new blog, and I was so jealous that I wanted one, t
