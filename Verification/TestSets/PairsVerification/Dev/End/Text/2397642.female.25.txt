It's been a full year now... I can't help but retrace the steps I took last year... I haven't cried at all... I have been thinking about her alot today... just no tears are coming... I miss her with a passion but I just wish she was here... I miss my mommy... I have been trying to get ahold of my dad for the past couple of hours I think he is on the phone with someone...   My little brother is getting married to a woman I just don't think he should be married to... It worries me because she is like 31 and he is only 21... she has 3 kids... My brother doesn't need it... If it was up to me I would place him with a 19-22 year old kids okey (hell he has one...) I just don't know...  I heard through the grapevie my ex-brother in law is getting remarried not even a year after his divorce was final... Crazy.... I hope my neices will be all right with it... I worry about them... especially the oldest Anna... I am sure she will be all right but I just don't know...  Well going to try the father again...   Later Days  R
