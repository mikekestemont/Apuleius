scrap heap. We had it a long long time and its been all over the UK carrying us all to Camps, conferences, CND Rallies, The Nelson Mandela Freedom March etc etc. It has carried children and adults of all nationalities - Polish, Maltese, Indian, Palestinian, Western Saharawi, Norwegians, Latvians, Lithuanians, French, Swedish, Welsh, Irish, English and Scottish. A real mini bus of Babel. It was an F plate Ford Transit 12 seater, big brash and yellow and a real sweetie to drive at first. I only ever remember it breaking down once, on the way to the New Forest, when the exhaust fell off and we had a skinny teenage member climb under and tie it up with a scarf. We carried on into Southhampton sounding like a Chieftan Tank, we turned a few heads that day. My fondest memories of the mini bus were when it was stapped fu wi weans all singing their wee hearts out - H Bomb Thunder or the Mighty Song of Peace or the Diaorrhea song - "People thinks its funny but it's really brown and runny" - a classic, but not one for the parents to hear.  The weather has been muggily damp, we've waited for thunderstorms most nights to no avail. Today when I was talking to my neighbour Wullie at the front gate, a muckle seagull swooped and grabbed a wee sparra that was perched on oor roof. The Gull shook it till it's neck broke and then fought other Gulls off to eat it. This neighbourhood is getting less like the Bronx and more like the Serengeti!  Moli has got us all ready for Camp tomorrow on Arran, I'm looking forward to it as are the sprogs. Over the last few days I've finalised the programme of activities and hope all goes well. Not a big camp this year, around 30, but more manageable and less work. My favourite part of camp is at night when the kids are bedded down, sitting at a smouldering camp fire with a glass or a smoke and good company. I always get a feeling that others have done this before us, in this spot,before their own warming fire, searching the same skies, sharing the same hopes and fears but seperated by the mists of time. Then you get bitten by a midgie and eff off to bed.  Moli is not joining us (pathological hatred of insects) and will have to suffer a period os calm and tranquility Chez Posties. Poste Restante till Tuesday.
Peter Ross interviewed Robbie Coltrane in the Sunday Herald mag. "A woman walks into a Bar - The Barman says "What are you having/" She replies, "I'll have a Double Entendre", so he gives her one. Edinburgh Book Festival pull out Toni Morrison compares todays USA to days of McCarthy with the Patriot Act. Chomsky reckons USA on permamnent war economy, agreed by political elites. And yet, it was a beautiful sunny day here today, lounged about, cooked dinner twice to accomodate Zeko's fitba training, nows plays for Irvine Meadow Boys C
