give my opinions and thoughts on it. i was able to get Su into the deal as well. she's very excited. and to make the deal sweeter, they are paying us $100 each for our time. can't beat that!  my old friend  urlLink An  is in town this week before she moves out to hawaii. i'm hoping i get the chance to see her before she goes.  and speaking of old friends, an old neighbor of mine from high school called me up out of the blue. she apparently is out of the coast guard now and living in prescott. she asked if i was married yet and when i said not yet she asked if i was engaged. answering not yet to that she then informs me that she's living the single life up there and that she'll be in town on the 18th to visit some friends. i was getting ready to go out for the evening when she called and at this moment Su arrived. i told her that Su was there and i had to get going but that i'd call her back sometime to chat. told Su about the call and she immediately guessed that this old friend was 'fishing', trying to see if i was single. bummer for her i'm not. though i did think it odd to hear from her out of the blue. we're talking at least 5 years since i last spoke to her.  anywho, that's enough for now. i think i might head up to the grocery store. all this traveling has left my fridge quite bare.
