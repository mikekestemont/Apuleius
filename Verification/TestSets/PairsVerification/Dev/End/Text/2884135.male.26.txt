Rainbow   The prickly sharpened thorns Oh sweet smell of red roses Light reflects many new morns Morning orange hue proposes A new day and let the sun bloom Yellow lilies: sun has a class Of being sincere and broom The evil away from green grass I lie down and look up 'noon sky Royal blue calms me and I praise The pale purple clouds up high Above I and the humidity arise Rain shoots us the magicked arrows  And the birthing of rare rainbows  ~Kekua,  June 2004

Gay Chinese Pride    I always get a Chinese good luck packet colored brightest red  Every year, the Chinese new year, and I like to eat tea bread  I like to dine at Chinese restaurant and order tofu with orange Oh tasty sauce; the Chinese dish, so mysteriously strange I recognize myself as part-Chinese, feeling the royalty of yellow It brings me balance and a peace of mind; as a Chinese fellow I want to own a Chinese jade bracelet - a beauty, so pearly green The joy of wearing jewerly and be a beautiful Chinese drag queen I also wish to obtain another priceless necklace of Chinese blue  Topaz and it accentuates the Chinese silk dress all in white hue I enjoy to eat the variety of vegetables such as the Chinese purple Cabbages and eggplants; the Chinese way to be a healthy person I love the Chinese culture for the spiceness of life and I shall bow  To you and proclaim that I am gay; the Chinese style of rainbow    ~Kekua,  June 2004
