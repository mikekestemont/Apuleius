will help you a little (21%).    But, if your prescription drug costs are over $5100 per year, Medicare Part D will be picking up 95% of the costs.    For a HUGE example, let’s say that your prescription drug costs are $1000 per month.  That’s $12,000 for the year.    At the $5100 level, again, you would have paid out $3600 (deductible, coinsurance and doughnut hole), plus $420 (or more) for your Part D premium.  But, at $12,000 worth of prescriptions, Part D is going to pay for 95% of your meds after the first $5100, so that would be 95% of $6900, or $6555.  You would pay 5% of the $6900 which is $345.    So, with $12000 worth of annual prescriptions, Medicare Part D has paid out $1080 (on the first $5100) and $6555 (on the next $6900) for a total of $7635.  You have paid out $420  (or more) premium + $500 (25% co-pay on $2000) + $2850 doughnut hole + $345 (5% co-pay on $6900) for a total of $3865.    So, will the 2006 Part D of Medicare help you if you opt in?  That’s a good question.  If you are paying over $400 per month for your prescriptions, it MAY be a good deal for you.    Here’s an interesting thought.  What level of expenditure would I have to reach for the Medicare Part D to have actually paid at least half of my drug bills?  Isn’t math fun?  ;-)   Here Medicare is talking of coinsurance levels where they pay 75% and 95%, and yet when doing the real complicated math here, you have to spend OVER $8000 per year on prescription drugs before Medicare Part D gets to the point where they’ve paid even HALF of your costs.    This whole Medicare Prescription Card and Insurance deal reminds me of 1986.  Seniors, including backing by the AARP begged for Catastrophic Coverage under Medicare.  Congress passed the Medicare Catastrophic Act of 1986, then when the Seniors found out what they were getting BEGGED TO HAVE IT REPEALED, and it was.  It seems that when the Seniors found out that they HAD TO PAY FOR THE EXTRA COVERAGE, they didn't want it!  Well, imagine what is going to happen with this so-called MEDICARE PART D (Prescription Insurance) when Seniors find out what it is going to cost them!
