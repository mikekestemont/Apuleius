quiver in my arms and I know for that moment why we are here, why the world is so hard, because in fact this love is here. So if by chance it is all gone when I woke up tomorrow, this month and a half with Nathan in my life would have made years of suffering worthwhile but I don't want to go back ever, not now that I am here. Why would someone leave heaven to endure hell, thats the way it feels, I would never give this up, I would sooner throw all my possesions out the window and run away from it all then give up this feeling give up this love this passion that has taken me over. I sit here and type, I tell myself to stop but I can't express it not in a million words. I want to come one and just say what I've been up to but am overwhelmed with this feeling to share with the world the hope that exists that is there. So for those of you who have endured and read my long and senseless ranting take with you these words of advice, whatever pain you have undergone and continue to undergo there is hope there is love, when there is war and hate and murder there is love and hope so never give up, dream and enjoy every second because on one day you will look back and those little moments like singing along in the car and feeling awkward because you know your voice cracks and the person next to you can't take it, remember those moments are the moments we live for, those are the true moments that we truly LIVE.
So no one realy cares anymore, huh?  Carissa
I need some assistants, I am currently compiling a basket for the Muffin Man's wife, I just heard news of his awful death, or atleast I think he is dead. WHEATON has eaten him, I need to perform surgery immediantly before it is too late, will someone tie Wheaton down for me? Carissa you would be good at that. WE MUST SAVE THE MUFFIN MAN!
We need a waltz on here...I mean, c'mon, everyone needs to dance. And I'm in an incredibly silly mood.  blame the Monty Python overdose last night...but anyway. I also find it funny that the (only) one who DOESN'T know how to waltz is posting a *ahum* waltz. But yes,...sillyness.  [begins dancing...oops, no music yet...oh well...CARRY ON!!!]  POST POST POST, POSTPOST. (and uh, one, and uh, two, and a three...) POST POST POST, POSTPOST. (one...two...three...four...) POSTPOSTPOSTPOST...POST. (oh, you get the hint by now!)  POST POST POST, POSTPOST. POST POST POST, POSTPOST. POSTPOSTPOSTPOST...POST.  PO-PO-PO-PO-PO-PO-PO-PO-POST!!! (exhuberent dancing ensues.)  Ok...maybe I don't waltz. Maybe I just leap around. But hey, someone only tried to teach me once. And when it's Nord...more just a matter of making sure you don't get stepped on/step on her.   Ahum...NORA COMES HOME FROM LONDON TODAY!!!! YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!!!!  So now...go out and dance in front of people until they stare at you. It's fun!!!  Ta, M
