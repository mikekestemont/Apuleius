his new experience keep going. John was immeditatly unburdened from thinking about his belongings and his LSD because they were gone now and it did not bother him. He was already in a better state of peace then before, and a sense of confidence overwhelmed him that he would soon reach is goal.
Everyone and everything IS connected...   Here are just Three Prime Examples of this, so for those non-believers here you go...   1) Scientific explanation   #1  -Science says that the big bang took place and that started everything. This means that everything, all the matter in space was brought together to ONE tinnnny little ball about 15 to 20 Billion years ago. Everything was in this one TINY little eetsy beetsy ball. The heat and pressure became so immense that everything went KABOOM (note : it may not have been that exact sound, it could have been Waboom, or perhaps Just Boom, whichever you prefer =-)). As it went 'Kaboom' (if you will) Matter and Non-Matter alike went FLYING and ZOOMING across setting itself up for the universe as we know it today. Thus everything as we know it today was made up of everything that was in that TINY little point. We All came from the same Start. We are all connected.   2) Scientific Theory #2  The String Theory... This Theory basically states that everything in the universe is connected by little strings. These Strings are suspended by each other in space. They are so small that even, at the moment, our most advanced microscopes cant detect them. Anyway, when one string is vibrated, it is like a spiders web, it vibrates the next and so on an so forth with the signal of the vibration, over time, getting weaker until it stops. This means that every action, and every thought that comes out of us, vibrates these strings and causes other things to be set in motion.   3) Religious Theory  - We All came from God. We All came from the same creator , and thus we are all apart of Eachother And Our Creator. Simple As That. When A Raindrop hits a puddle, what happens to the raindrops integrity? Is it still its own raindrop, but just dispersed into and throughout the puddle it landed into? The Raindrop has blended in the puddle becoming apart of it. Likewise, the puddle has blended into the raindrop becoming apart of it.  - All in All we humans are all apart of eachother, we are connected with the bold trees, the gentle grass, the amazing animals, EvErYtHiNg. This means that anything that we do, or think, effects everything else, eventually coming back and effecting us again. Its all one big circle and everyone of us are on the ride. Such a Truly Remarkable thing it All Is.    - Even if you do not believe it, it Sill Exists.     ...Difference is If You DO believe, then you get to see and Expierience it.
