way out, I saw my elk again.  He's an 11x11, just a gorgeous creature.  And I saw a bobcat and an eight-point whitetail.  Is it fall yet?      urlLink       urlLink
Not so long ago, I wrote in about Christian liberty and the Sabbath, and made the comment that I wasn't sure whether or not Jesus kept the Sabbath as required by the Old Testament.  After doing some reading, I'd like to offer some new insight into that question and officially make up my mind.    In a word, He did not.  This is very important question, because it has implications regarding covenant theology, the importance of the Law, and other things.  So, I officially think that He kept the Sabbath not only according to His own standards, but according to the Word of God revealed to Moses (as if they were different).    My decision has been based on some very interesting commentary on the Gospel of Mark by Mark Horne (see  urlLink The Victory According to Mark ).  He looks at the famous story of the disciples picking grain on the Sabbath, and how Jesus claims that He, being the Son of Man, is also the Lord of the Sabbath (Mark 2:27-28).  In a nutshell, there is nothing contradictory with the Old Testament Sabbath Law in this story except the Pharisees' interpretation.
One interesting thing we've seen this time around is that a good number of the famous stories in John (especially in chapters 5-12) come in the context of attacking the Jews.  Jesus teaches about the Good Shepherd in chapter 10 as a response to a question from the Jews: "Are we blind too?".  His episode with the woman caught in adultery (8:1-11) comes sandwiched in between arguments with the Jews, and furthers the debate.  Why is all this arguing necessary?  Why doesn't John just teach us about Jesus for who He is?    Here's an answer I'd like to propose.  John does this in part because he understands the continuity of the New Covenant with Old Testament religion.  If Jesus were bringing a completely new administration of religion to earth, why not just ignore the old ones?  Jesus didn't spend a lot of time pointing out the religious hypocrisies and sins of the ancient prosititution cults, for instance.  Jesus attacks the Jews because they are the administrators of the Covenant as it stands in His day, and they are wicked shepherds and hired hands.  He is rescuing the Covenant of God from those who hate God and returning it to those who love Him.    And in the process, Jesus shows us how He is greater than the externals of Old Testament religion.  He is greater than Moses, because He wrote the Law.  He is greater than the Temple, because He can raise it up and destroy it.  He is greater than the priests because He has the authority to pass judgment in the Temple.  He is greater that these things in the same way that an object is greater than its shadow.  He is not replacing the old, but bringing it into the L
