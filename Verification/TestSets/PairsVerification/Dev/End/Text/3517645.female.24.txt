all the time, then my sleep does not lack.  After I got home from work last night we took the kids for a walk on the green and then stopped at the wilmont park outdoor wading pool for a minute.  It is mom's birthday tomorrow. I am still now sure what I am going to get her. She has everything. I might get the kids to make her something. Maybe I will take them to get a craft or something at the craft store. I won't see her until Saturday.
Well it is day two and I am just as tired as I was yesterday even though I went to bed at 10pm. I tried to stay up to watch the Amazing Race, which comes on at 11pm, but there was a thunderstorm and the rain was insane, which made our satillite go out of wack so we couldn't get a signal anyways. so off to bed I went. I had a good sleep until about 1am, then the kids both came in and it was all down hill from there. I am sure they had a great sleep all cuddied between duane and I. The lightening last night was pretty cool, especially when I drove across the bridge to get home from work. I love thunder and lightening storms. In saint john we hardly ever got them, but here in fredericton at least once a week you see lightening.   I am now studying for my next exam. Only three more and then I get a bonus, whoo. But what sucks about getting the bonus it that the government takes almost half before I even see it. which is crazy cause I have to work hard for that bonus. all well that is the way it works and we can't do much about it.
Well it was back to work for me today. It was a nice longweekend. We went to the camp on Saturday morning and come home last night. My aunt and uncle were there with their dog Ares. My aunt's sister came to visit for a night with her two kids, so my kids had some other kids to play with, so they were happy. we spend quite a bit of time at the beach. Harley came with us too. He had a great time swimming and stuff. We let him off the leash and he didn't run away like he usually does, we think it was because the other dog was there so he was being good. exceptional good.  My eating good is going ok, I did have a couple sweets and things on the weekend, but that is expected every once in awhile. I haven't been to the gym since friday morning and am not sure when I am going to get back, now that I am on day shift. After work I have to go directly to the babysitters and get the kids. Maybe on my days off.  If this post doesnt' make much sense it is because I am extremely tired. to busy of a w
