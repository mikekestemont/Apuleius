to our dear mr. reagan,   you were a tough old bird. a comical irish joker. a family man. a valiant patriot.  i respect you and your efforts. i admired your strength, your poise, your wit. you were strong in times of weakness. you led Americans through a lot of changes throughout your terms. as i grew up in the 80's, i loved my president & my first lady. you two were the greatest in this child's eyes. even as i grew up & learned more about the negative events that took place during your presidency, i still maintained respect for you. for you gave us Americans hope & pride.   with your passing upon us, i hope that once again, we as Americans can see that there is hope for a better tomorrow, that this war will have a positive outcome & our soldiers come home safely to their families once the job is done.   may your spirit walk among us & give the American people that hope & pride once again.  bless your spirit always.
had a great 3-day weekend. saw shrek 2. learned how to drive stick shift. planted a garden. drove to newport news to see marshman's mom & bro. (side note: if you're ever in newport news, please make it worth your while & eat at Cheddar's. IT ROCKS!)went to williamsburg on the way back home. bought some new vans for $20. gotta love that outlet store. it's so dern cheap. friday night we found out that marshman was going to lancaster all week until saturday night. so this will give me some time to clean & straighten up my bedroom & office. (which i wanted to do this weekend, but never really got around to doing it).  this thursday night is grrrls night out. pizza & beer. good times shall be had by all. holy crap, that's tomorrow. i love 4-day work weeks. it's closer to the weekend. today i am driving with a co-worker to charlottesville to find a new digital camera for the corporate office. should be a fun trip. this dude's really cool. he's like in his mid-40's and he's got the coolest kid i think i've ever met. his kid's like 10 and he's an actor and he's very artsy. gals you'd love this kid to death. he's years beyond the rest of his age group. so i'm sure we'll talk about him alot on the trip.  ok. time to go get ready for another day at work. x's & o's for all of you!
