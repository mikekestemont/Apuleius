today...by burning old notes and love letters. It's the last portion of the feng shui business that I did to my room. The theory is/was that by keeping the notes, I was keeping a part of my past and that inturn was affecting my ability to grasp the present (I think?). So I've now let that part of me go (in a flaming inferno that had the neighbors wondering...) and I feel pretty good about it.   Short post, no doubt, but I'm going to hit the hay early(heh heh, early...). It's a beautiful night. Not a sleeping night. Nevertheless, lots to do tomorrow.    Take care, y'all.
red sun rising, take warning as you will for this star shines upon life been spilled widows cry and pancakes fry and dust dries painted neath the red blood sky            can you tell i've read too much steinbeck for my own damned good?
Well folks, the crappy weather followed me home from the hills of western PA.  I haven't had the motivation to be hardcore or else I would have run in the rain. Or heat.       Familiar tune, eh?      I babysat for the first time in months yesterday.  Definitely a good day, minus the popcorn eating and movie watching. Being lazy isn't what I need right now, not to mention it's the third time in less than a week that I've seen a movie.  I've been a total fattie (heh heh).       Lots of loose ends...it's been sortof an emotional last 24 hours.  I picked up my camp pictures from Meijers w/ Michelle last night. Granted, I did get made fun of severely for carrying that crazy diesel sized camera around with me....but it took some great pictures.        I also told my parents about my dear boy :) .        But, their reaction was much better than expected...even though I'm still sortof confused as to how they took the news.   Atleast they know where my heart is now.
I'm finally home after my two weeks at the Antiochian Village. All in all, it was one of the greatest experiences of my life. [As Drew Haas would say, "The Village is a spiritual rebirth."]  There are so many people to thank... great times, great memories.   Feels like part of me has turned a new leaf.  I came home exhausted on Friday and ate dinner with the family, saw Ashley (my momma),  then slept for close to 15 hours. Granted, this pales in comparison to the 20+ hours I usually get when I come home from camp...but I had stuff to do, and it was sortof hard to sleep because I'm sick.  The past 2 days have been laundry, Popeye's chicken and junkfood and watching videos w/ Michelle and Anton, sleeping, missing Cory, and trying to sing in church (which didn't work out too well since I'm totally The Sick).  Plans for tonight include watching Erin Craig's last ballet performance (before she moves to FL)at the Toledo Zoo Amphitheater, then going to see M. Night Shyamalan's The Village. Quite appropriate, considering where I just came home from...   Hugs and Kisses~ the q
