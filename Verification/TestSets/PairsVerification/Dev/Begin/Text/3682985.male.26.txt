urlLink    This isn't me! He's one of my hamsters, sleeping on torn pages of some financial reports. He's my fund manager. &nbsp; urlLink
Created my first Blog! Hurray!
urlLink    Here's their mom. You can tell the yellow and the grey colour are on different strands of the "fur" gene ... The kittens had another brother who's grey in colour but disappeared ... They grew up under our shoe-rack. Maybe next time I can record the noises they made and post it here ...&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Little Yellow's (Xiao Huang) brother ... not sure whether it's a female or male ... let me ask me dad .... ^_^ &nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Also took some pics of my kittens. This is Little Yellow, besides the sandals that I wear to work everyday ...&nbsp; urlLink

urlLink    Took a day off work today! Basically spent most of the day doing house cleaning on me PC. Transferring big chunks of files to CDs. Videos burned onto CDs in NTSC format appear to be inproportionately wiiiiddddeeeee ... Tested files burned in NTSC and PAL format on the new DVD player ... looks fine on the screen except that the "ultra-low" resolution looks pretty ugly on a 29" TV. Which means a blackhead on your left chin may expand into a 2mm mole on your face and you lose a few teeth when you smile .... Me dad dragged me to take some photos of a waterfall somewhere near Island Park, behind some of the houses by the hillside cos he's seen quite a magnificent sight yesterday when it rained heavily. He was disappointed when it lost some volumes but it's still quite beautiful .... There's a sort of a temple where believers pray to the Natuk Gong ... First time I saw a statue of a Natuk Gong ... dressed in Baba-nyonya cloths and wears a songkok .... Was looking out for a name though can't find any ... cos Bear said in Kluang, their Natuks have names .... Penang Natuks remain anonymous ... well, if I'm a Natuk, I wouldn't want to have a common name either ... &nbsp; urlLink
When I casually broke the news to a friend that one of my hamsters died (you can see his pic at my second post), I was quite taken aback when he non-chalantly answered, "Good!". My fleet-of-the-moment horror that his statement was born out of malign intention was subsequently alleviated when he continued, "Now do you still want to rear anymore hamsters?" It wasn't till the evening when I have some time to myself to think about this that it all started to make some sense. This friend of mine grew up in a monster family consisting of five children. In a family of this make-up, certain privileges and creature-comforts are bound to be spread around unevenly and thinly across the siblings where the biggest factors determining the "course of distribution" include the order to which each child is born i.e. the eldest probably gets to study overseas while the youngest is l
