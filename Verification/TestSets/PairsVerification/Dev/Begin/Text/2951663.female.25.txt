I finished  Traveling Mercies . It was definitely one of the best books I've read in a long time. I have to decide who I should pass it on to now because it's a book to be shared.  It is an absolutely beautiful day outside today. I love it. I find it amazing how much the weather affects my moods. I was in a good mood today and yesterday because it was nice outside. I could easily have thought of 60 things that should have put me in a bad mood though. And I honestly believe if the weather had been different I probably would have been in a bad mood. The more I think about it the more it upsets me that I let things such as the weather affect my disposition so much. It makes sense - but still. (John hates it when I say "but still..." so tell me if you do too and I'll stop. Ok, maybe not, but still)   I want to be able to look for "the good" in rainy days.  Maybe that should be my new motto or life goal or something important like that.
Sorry - I know I haven't written much lately. I didn't feel well and then was busy. (excuses, excuses)  Do you ever have irrational fears? I do. I have on in particular right now that is weighing on my mind. It's actually pretty common too....   The DENTIST.   I haven't been in over a year.

When we moved to PA we started seeing a man who went to our church and was recommended to us. I left every single time in pain. He would claim my jaw was too small and just force my mouth open. Floss so that my mouth bled. You know how it is. So when I got married, I thought I would just go see the same dentist John did. Well this guy was a completely whack. I kid you not. The assistant who cleaned my teeth made my mouth so sore it hurt to eat for days. Then the dentist came in - looked at my wisdom teeth which had just started coming in and said - "Do they bother you?" When I said, "only sometimes" he said "ok, we'll leave them in then - no biggie."  I have since learned that this is not "no biggie."  I have also since learned that he told my sister-in-law, Jill, that she had no cavities and she has since found out she had four that he missed.  Since seeing this dentist my jaw has given me more problems. It tends to lock up and overall just ache a lot. This made me nervous that I might see the same assistant again. So I didn't call to make an appt. Plus I had a bad feeling about my wisdom teeth so I just put it o
