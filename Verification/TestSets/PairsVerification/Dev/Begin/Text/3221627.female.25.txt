So now it's "official" - anyone opposed to Israel is defined by Webster as anti-semitic. Isn't there another dictionary that we could demand be used besides Webster's? Why can't we create our own damn dictionaries - how did Amerikkka and Israel suddenly get the power to dictate the definitions of words of a language spoken by millions?   Maybe we should all boycott the english language completely, i'd be down for that...  This is a great line in the article below:  "it is Zionism, and not anti-Zionism, that is the equivalent of anti-Semitism."   ANTI-ZIONISM VS. ANTI-SEMITISM WEBSTER'S AMERICAN-ISRAELI DICTIONARY  Al-Ayyam (p. 18) by Ali Al-Khalil -- [June 28] In this time of escalated oppressive Israeli practices against our people, our rights and existence in our torn and devastated homeland, any criticism of Israeli policy is automatically translated into "anti-Semitism." This is prevalent in both the Israeli political-cultural-media discourse and its American counterpart, which conforms to the Israeli discourse of falsification. No matter the nationality, identity or association of the critic, this systematic Israeli-American change, or "conversion," turns him into an "anti-Semite" who is haunted everywhere by this discourse and is besieged and stifled by the dangerous accusations of "anti-Semitism."  The Israeli-American discourse silences any voice that is critical of Israel's policy with a firm, terrorist policy of silencing. This kills those voices, distorts and discreds them, and silences other voices that dare merely to approach the threshold of this forbidden and hunted criticism. On both the declarative and practical levels, the current American policy of a world war on "terrorism," as per the modern colonialist and imperialist definition of this term worldwide, has increasingly become intertwined with Israel's policy, particularly in the Middle East. This discourse encompasses a greater Middle East, which is comprised of the Arab world, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran. Silencing by means of leveling accusations of "anti-Semitism" has silenced the voices that criticize American policy (crimes) in the Middle East.  It is an historical and geographical fact that "anti-Semitism" is strictly a European term that was born in Europe and spread across the continent. It entered European languages for economic, social, cultural and political reasons that stemmed from that European reality. The term was religiously based and meant being against Jews or Judaism in Europe. The term was coined by the German journalist Wilhelm Marr in 1877 in his book, The Victory of Judaism over Germanism. But Zionist thinking sought to strip this term of its historical and geographical constrictions so it might, early on, successfully impose a formula equating anti-Semitism with anti-Zionism.  At first, the Zionist ideology that Israel was built on failed to impose this abusive formula on any governmental or civil body outside Israel. In the fall of 1975, the UN passed an important resolution to confront the Zionist goal by deeming Zionism to be a racist movement, just as anti-Semitism is racist. To wit, it is Zionism, and not anti-Zionism, that is the equivalent of anti-Semitism.  The UN resolution turned the Zionist formula upside down and contributed to the exposure of the truth that Z
