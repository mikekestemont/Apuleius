Once again, Toma and I are talking on AIM now. Which reminds me. My AOL screen name is saladinator. I'm online a lot now, so feel free to chat w/ me anytime. Since I have nothing else to do.
I've been getting random emails about my  urlLink quiz . I'm beginning to wonder what kind of a name is "Who do you think?" and why mother mother has 2 email addresses.
Hope everybody has a good time @ Joanna's party! I won't be there for several reasons   1)I wasn't invited.  2)I'm too lazy.  3)I can't think of another reason.

Today was the last day of school. The variety show was good. Except for the string part. We were good, but we just stood out too much. I'll play bass next time.  urlLink Toma  got some well deserved awards today. Except for the Bill Gates award. No offense Toma, but  urlLink Michael Flagg's Computer Company  deserved that one. Good work emceeing all of you that did it! Go Boerner as Michael Jackson! Not really.     urlLink Mandolin  sat by me today during the assembly! Ha ha Mr. Newendork. Thought you could make me sit with my own team twice? Ha.
Mmmmm, nuts.
As everyone else seems to be doing it, I have invited Toma to join my golb.
That stupid bird got into my house this time. Once again, it only knew the concept "in".
President Bush sigened my award today. That means several things.   1) I am never trusting any outside-of-school-but-funded-by-it programs.       2) I will burn this award.   3) He is trying to convince me to support him. Even though I cannot vote.   4) Kerry is just as bad.
A few days ago, there was a mentally retarded bird in my garage. I say "Shoo bird. Don't bother me." "Get out," This bird had one concept down: in. To make matters worse, when I scared him away, he went right back  in . So I scream "Get out, you (censored) (censored) (censored) BIRD BRAIN!" Miraculously, the combination of that and the broom caused him to leave. Stupid bird.
I have been kicked out by Yes Maybe. Guess I'll just have to update my own stuff for a second.
Today,  urlLink Mandolin ,  urlLink Nick , and Peige were my companions during today's Adventureland Trip. Peige was a bossy wimp, Nick was hyper, Amanda was great and went on the roller coasters with me. It was all Peige's fault. If it wasn't for peige, I wouldn't be sitting on a towel as I type this. Peige is evil. It was unroomy the second time at the covered wagon ride that I don't remember the name of. Peige talked bad about me. There was also a great war on where we all were after a while. We finally met on the Ski lift thingy. It was odd. Today has been strange. But fortunately, I had Mandolin to burst out laughing randomly with me.
I'm a genius. But I'm a misunderstood genius. Why, you ask? Because nobody thinks I'm a
