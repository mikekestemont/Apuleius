Lets talk about Resilience. One of my favorite words ever. RESILIENCE!! I love the word Perseverence as well.... forgive me if i misspelled that. Taken straight from the miriam webster dictionary website :   One entry found for resilience.  Main Entry: re·sil·ience  Pronunciation: ri-'zil-y&n(t)s Function: noun 1 : the capability of a strained body to recover its size and shape after deformation caused especially by compressive stress  The CAPABILITY.... see that??? the CAPABILITY of a body to RECOVER........... caused especially by COMPRESSIVE STRESS. I know i skipped a piece in the middle but i will get back to that. Who ever knew that a CAPABILITY would be a noun?? Doesnt it seem more like a verb??   Anyhow, read it slowly..... close your eyes, repeat it to yourself..... The CAPABILITY of a body to RECOVER its size and shape after DEFORMATION. WOW is all i can say, what a statement. Just how resilient are you?? What of yours has been dented, walked on, smeared across the pavement, stomped on, crucified, and most of all broken?? When it happened, what did you do about it?? Did you sit there and cry like a little bitch??? Please say you didnt. Did you whine and blame and toss hints for someone to feel sorry and look down on you?? God i hope not. If so please stop reading my blog and go draw.....   Ok, for those still reading my blog, you draw too..... in your mind, or even better on paper. This is your lesson for the day..... a lesson on RESILIENCE.   Draw a circle, a PERFECT circle and turn it 3-dimensional into a sphere. A PERFECT sphere the size of a baseball except only SLIGHTLY smaller. NOW, got that? perfect sphere? good..... hold it at the level of your diaphragm.... no not the one that chicks use down there.... your diaphragm.... take a DEEP beath and where you feel like your lungs wont expand anymore, thats it.You can even feel the gap in between your expanded lungs if you concentrate hard enough...... THATS where you are to hold that sphere. Hold it tightly with your hand and then RELEASE IT. Think hard, dont let that sphere drop. levitate it if you will to sit there at the level i spoke of earlier. Let it slightly rotate.... like the earth sittin on its axis maybe..... NOW, imagine that sphere is inside of you, at the same level... just sittin there slightly spinnin, slightly turning, slightly chillin even. What color is it??? Usually that color represents who you are, your general outlook on yourself and the outside world.   OK, back to Resilience....... that sphere, is you. Your life force, or chi as some may call it. Every breath you take, concentrate on slightly spinning that sphere with the force of inspiration and expiration. Keep that sphere at a constant rotation. That sphere is your life..... that sphere is your mood, and that sphere is there to keep you balanced and ONE with this world that will all to often try to fuck you over many many t
