something happy happened that i have to tell u guys!
Tomorrow is the last day of driver's ed!
"... nothing pure divine or lovely inhabits these old walls, we scream for you to save us but dont feel you when we fall."  that is a quote from a nice poem that i read recently
Tomorrow my parents are making me drive to Wisconsin, which means I have to drive on the freeway and merge with all the trucks and cars going 65 mph!  That will not be good.  Well I guess everyone has to have a first time.
hmm i'd say that my goal would be to........sell almost everything i own.  seriously.
One of my summer goals is not to turn the TV on for more than an hour every day.
i have a dance recital ! I only have limited tickets so just ya kno bear with me i will call you!
so this summer we have to have.......hm.....like summer goals.  of amazingness.
wow group blog! so exciting. i was lucky enough to have this webpage load after about 20-30 minutes. our movie/starbucks/funky munky extravagant escapade was superb. i love harry potter. well actually rupert but thats not the point. i'm so incredibly happy that school is over. man now that i have an oppurtunity to blog i cant think of things to say. saturday is the car wash and the despite popular belief/diminished concert! driver's ed is almost over and im happy about that. im afraid of the approaching texas vacation. i won't have contact with anyone for  2 weeks  yikes. too much togetherness if you ask me. but my input doesn't count in my family. so i have to go. next year of school will most likely be better. i have a feeling that some of the incoming freshman will try to rebel and overthrow the hierarchy that is jacobs high school. it will be funny. and annoying. i think we need to go to an ashby furlough concert very soon because i miss them. well thats all from me for now, who knows when i shall post again. adios
What's going on everyone?  Driver's Ed was super boring.
summer is here.......the first day unfortunately was dreary.
Katy, we will run at 5 sometime this summer, so get ready!
Ahh...Harry Potter.  What a movie.  I love that Rupert.
Harry D. Jacobs! First of all only idiots name a school after themselves.  The end of school is very bittersweet.  It is bitter because there are finals that can totally trash your entire grade! What?!? Anyways I am not wasting my  summer.  I will be behind the wheel!  Love is in the air.......NOT!  Maybe this year we will run those runs at 5 in the morning haha! WEll I think I need to leave cuz i am wasting my summer!!!!! I am going to try to eat noodles actually cuz my teeth hurt soooo bad! I love you!
