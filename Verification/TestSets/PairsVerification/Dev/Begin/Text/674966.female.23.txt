We discussed dystopian visions (and utopian ones, but less so) in CS201 today and it reminded me of something I've been struck by. (This in no way implies that others haven't been struck by this or that it is original. But it's new to me. :) ) I have an impression that the fantasies of science fiction often predict technologies that are actually developed, and I don't think this is because the Nostradamus-like qualities of the authors.  One, does such a link actually exist?   * the "Good Old Fashioned" AI program -- focusing on making computers that can completely interact with humans but be more perfect information processors -- seems to have preceeded by sci-fi fantasies like Metropolis (or really, just the very natural-seeming idea that we'd want perfect slaves)   * cyberspace (but I haven't actually read Neuromancer yet, so I might be blowing hot air)  * ?  But why might such a link exist? It doesn't make intuitive sense to me that technologists would read about dystopias and decide to bring it about in a megalomaniacal urge to intervene. More likely it seems that science fiction's predictions would become decontextualized as the ideas travel through literature and social networks, stripping the technologies imagined from the dystopian contexts iin which they were first imagined. Or, perhaps there isn't decontextualization, but just an optimism that 1) it's just a little device or 2) we can always choose whether we want to follow the next step technology makes available to us.  Any thoughts on the nature of interconnections between literature and the technological imagination?
If you guys have any ideas, I would love to hear any suggestions on my CLASSART 280 project:  So as you may or may not know, I am an electronica DJ at KZSU, and more generally a complete music nut. In putting together setlists, it is always difficult to limit yourself to the 10 or so tracks. For example, say I decide to start a downtempo electronica set with Fila Brazillia's "A Zed and Two L's." In thinking of what to transition to, I immediately can think of 20+ songs that I would love to play. Each transition would convey a slightly different experience, and lead the set in a unique direction.   And yet, ultimately you can only choose one next song. You are forced to ignore the other possibilities. Speaking from experience, that linearity is pretty goddamn frustrating.   So my idea is this: why not use a MUD/Adventure game interface (think Adventure, Zork, etc) and let a "listener" walk around a virtual world. Each area or "room" would have a song associated with it, playing in the background. That way, you could walk around and traverse the DJ set yourself - in non linear fashion. For example, maybe you start off in a house. If you go outside into the street, maybe the set becomes a jazz mix. But maybe if you walk upstairs instead, the mix turns into spooky ambient electronica.   As you can see, the other effect of the virtual world is that you could associate t
