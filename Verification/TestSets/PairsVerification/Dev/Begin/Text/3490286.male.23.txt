This would mark the first time for me to post on this blog. I have posted on several blogs previously, though most of them are dilapidated and decayed due to ill-usage and now lies abandonded in the eternal abyssal darkness called the Internet. Hopefully, this one does not share the same fate as its predecessors.   And with all beginnings, I suppose that an introduction is in order. By this point, should you feel the need to leave, please click on the little box with the large "X" on the upper right-hand side of your browser, thus effectively banishing my unsightly little blog away from your existence.  Now where was I? Oh yes, and introduction...  My name is Shahriman Latif. At the time of writing, I am merely a month away from turning twenty three years of age. And for the inept, or absent minded, I am the writer of this blog you now are starting at. This is evident by the fact that I am actually writing it.

I am presently living in a rather peaceful urban area named Subang Jaya, which is a province of sorts, in the state of Selangor, of which is part of the Federation of States of Malaysia.  In short: I live in Malaysia. I live about fifteen to two-hours (depending on traffic conditions) from Kuala Lumpur, the capital city of Malaysia.  I am currently pursuing a Law Degree from the Universiti Teknologi MARA, of which I discover myself about two semesters overdue from graduating. Dropping papers and whatnot, thus delaying my impending graduation. I've always been a slow learner, so this rather disturbing fact doesn't really disturb me much. Surprisingly.  I suppose in doing something, one must have a purpose or a reason to do whatever it is that he/she is doing that something. I shall now reveal to you the purpose of my writing this blog:  1)  As a cure for boredom . I am currently on a semester break, which spans a massive three months plus. Not that I'm complaining about having all this free time, though. On the contrary, I find it rather refreshing. I get to correspond with some of my friends, and they prove to be brilliant in accomodating me and my personal quirks and random opinions.  2)  As a testament to my ever changing mental health . I w
