Dear Lei;
I can not wait untill the day that I hold you in my arms and get to look in to those eyes of yours. To kiss you on your lips. Trace your face with my hands.  To trace the curves of your body. Hold your hand in mine. To have you rest your head on my shoulder, or to lay you head on my chest as we watch a movie or try to go to sleep. To comfort you when you need it. These are the things a dream of when I think of you. Your dreams are your own. I want to be part of them. I can not make all your dreams come true. I will do my best. Neither of us are perfect. We are after all only human. To err is human, to really screw up you need a computer. lol ;-) I am here for you now, and I will be here for you whenever you need me. I know we are a half a world apart. The distance will disappear with time. I will see to that. One day we will meet. On that day, you truly will be mine. Untill then my Love. I Love You with all my Heart.
I Love You
Love Kevin
Dear Lei;
You are like a rose. Very pretty and very fragile. With the proper nurturing, you will bloom and grow. With out love and tenderness, you will wither and fade away. You are to good a person to let that happen to. I want to be the one that gives you the love, warmth, tenderness and whatever else that you require to be happy and grow. I want to be your sun, and your rain. A rose needs both to survive. I will come for you.
I Love You Lei
Love Kevin
Dear Lei;
I Love You. It feels so good to say those words to someone again. It has been a very long time. I am pretty sure that it has been a long times since you heard those words said to you. I know that you are still skeptical. That is fine with me. If you can just try to listen to your heart, things will work out. I feel good again. I think that you are starting to feel good again too. We can not change our past. We can only learn from it. We do not want to forget it, then we are doomed to make the same mistakes again. Our future is all up to us to make it what we want. If you really, really want something then you have to go after it. You can not put half an effort towards getting what we want. If you do not go after something with 110% effort, then you do not really want it. I WANT YOU! I must warn you, when I truly want something, I always get it. I have the patients of a saint when it comes to getting exactly what I want. I can be very tenacious. I can wait for as long as it t
