Come together! -Literally!   You heard me, folks.  August 8th  the whole world will be celebrating the One World Orgasm Day - and don't you miss out! Sure sounds a lot better than christmas, don't you think?    urlLink http://www.angelfire.com/vt/alexigloo/OWO.html    ~:~   Yesterday, biking home from Nicole where I'd seen "The little mermaid" (clearly the nastiest disney movie ever!) I saw two  hares  sitting on the road right before me. I started biking faster, because I wanted to see how close I could get - and before I knew, I was  racing  them. I imagine it's a bit like swimming with dolphins -well, except that it's not all wet and you're on a bike and... ok, so maybe not, but I imagine&nbsp;the feeling might be similar, like you're actually a part of  nature . After a couple of blocks, the hares gave up and jumped in on someones&nbsp;garden,&nbsp;and I continued home. (Me getting into the garden&nbsp;after them would look a bit strange...) Anyway, I really recommend racing with hares. If you can get  hold  of any, that is.   ~:~     "Toss me a cigarette,  I think there's one in&nbsp;my raincoat"  "We smoked the last one  An hour ago"  So I looked at the scenery,  She read her magazine;  And the moon rose over an open field.   "Kathy I'm lost" I said,  though I knew she was sleeping.  "I'm empty and aching and  I don't know why"  Counting the cars  On the New Jersey Turnpike  They've all come  To look for America     ~:~   To be on your  way , and suddenly realising you've forgotten  why  and  where  you're going. Doesn't it feel like that?   Simon and Garfunkel are my  heroes !    Kisses/ Carrie
I just came home from the world's biggest arena shaped like a ball... And the two lovely&nbsp;gentlemen called Simon and Garfunkel that held my heart over the open fire for two and a half hour tonight. Now all I feel is bliss.   ~:~  Oh, I forgot to tell you: I'm engaged! Well, not really... But that day after all the whiskey, when I was lying in&nbsp;a sofa so far away from home,&nbsp;feeling like I could just die, my best friend My calls. Her voice made me so happy I could just fly, but I missed her so much. She told me that she had been to a party the day before and had met a girl who had gotten a "friendship-engagement" with her best friend. So My proposes to me, right there on the phone.  I love that girl, she's the best friend I've ever had. We've been looking for some nice silver rings to exchange on the big engagement-party we're planning. I love being engaged! But on the other hand, it wouldn't have been that bad if I had some guy that I could get on that well with too... But I guess I have to settle with having a good friendship relation... It's worth a great deal, that too.  ~:~  Apparently Robin, Tom's friend from up north, had added me on MSN... He cut his hair! He looks better, but I'm n
