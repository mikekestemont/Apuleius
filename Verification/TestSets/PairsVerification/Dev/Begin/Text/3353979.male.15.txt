who have i become,,, i have become the odd man out,,,, i dont think anyone notices me anymore...... Everyone just takes life as a joke, im taking my life seriously, im taking small things too seriously...
Today was one of those lazy tired days. Me and nicki went to haley and chalces house started playing kickball, then steven and kristen came, kristen remined me that she was avoiding me, all that everyone could do is fight, what happened to the days when we could just play a game and and have fun, then nathan and john came, i left...... went to the coffee house natan, john, steven,kristen,casey came down....... Kristen wont talk to her good friends but she'll talk to nathan,,,,, what is going on with kristen..... or have i changed......
Went to nickis house after school,, kristen came over, she dident say anything to me, i dident say anything to her,,, i went to the park,played basketball, nicki, kristen, haley and chalce came, started play kickball, kristen dident play, steven got mad and quit, kristen just isent the same person anymore,, yount came about an 20 min later,,, anytime someone from out of the neightboorhood comes she just completely ignors me, its almost like were not friends anymore...................
Me and nick were at haleys house, i told her that is still like kristen, she wasent happy and i just dont understand why....... I seen kristen talking to anna, when i got home i found out from steven that kristne was going to kennywood with anna, whats going on just 2 weeks ago she was saying how mean anna is.. kristen has really changed.............
Was able to talk to nicki for a short time, told her that kristen wont talk to me until i tell her how she has changed. Got to talk to randall. Everything is still unsettled... I got a million things i want to tell kristen,, i still like her, but someone has to tell her how she has changed, im afraid to tell her, the truth hurts.... I have to tell her that i still like her and how our friendship is different now that she knows................
Me nicki start to become better friends, but as me and nicki become better friends me and kristen become worse friends,,, ever since i told kristen i like her it hasent been the same. Yesterday when i found out she dident like me i just want to avoid her, i have nothing to say to her. I told kristen that me and nicki were talking about how she has changed, i wouldent tell her how she has change, she got mad and said she wouldent talk to me untill i told her. I dont want to tell her, i know it will just make things a lot worse. Maby its best that i dont see kristen for awhile............
Went to youth day talk,, wanted to talk to kristen all day,, of course i dident. Got home got to talk to nicki at haleys house, it was good to finally talk to nicki, we went to k
