Friday night and I'm stuck at home. There's a basketball game tonight, but my mom doesn't think I should go because of the weather. It is very very cold outside and the roads are all slick and snowy, so maybe it's a good idea. It was alittle hard for me to get home today after school because the hill wasn't plowed or anything and it was very scary. I thought I wasn't going to make it, but I did (going only 10 mph by the time I got to the top).   Tomorrow I have to get up very early, and I'm not looking forward to it, but when I get back Micki will be home. WOO HOO.   I was supposed to try out for the musical tonight, but tryouts tonight were postponed to sometime next week. It is called "Honk" and it's some silly play. Not many of my friends are trying out, I think Kayla is the only one. It should still be fun though.
I am starting a new blog, compliments to Buffalo Butt Breath.  No school today, due to snow. Last night I worked and my Chinese manager had no idea about three of us moving to grocery, and he was very very mad. However, I'm not on the schedule for next week for sacking (and the other 2 people are) so I dont know what's going on. I'm still looking for another job.   This weekend my sister is coming home. I'm excited. But, Saturday I have state show choir, so I have to get up at 4 AM, but return home in the early afternoon. I'm excited for show choir competitions to start. They're so much fun!   My New Years Resolution to exercise more is starting to die down. I think I'm going to go get a YMCA membership thing...which will hopefully make me go lift weights more often.   The school is doing a musical this year, about the ugly duckling or something (from what I heard). I think I'll probably try-out, considering I've been wanting to do the musical for the longest time. I don't know.
Well, it's been a crazy, crazy week. Ok, I guess it's just been a crazy last 3-4 days. First of all, I found out that I only got 4 hours this week and 4 hours next week, so I am once again applying for different jobs, praying that one of them will hire.   Now, to the bad news. I was in my last class on Friday and I got called to the office. The secretary told me that some woman called to tell me that Matthew couldn't take me to the game that night. So, I went back to class, not thinking anything of it. 10 minutes later they said on the intercom that everyone should obey all the stop signs on the new highway by Argyle because there was a wreck. I got the pit in my stomach thinking it was Matthew, because he has to cross that road. Sure enough, after class I had a voicemail from his mom s
