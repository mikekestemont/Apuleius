MEDS-80  PO BOX 1035 COLUMBIA, MO  65205-1035  EXCERPTS:    Those wild and wacky government officials have once again come up with a NEW benefit for Medicare Beneficiaries…  or have they?  The truth about the new Medicare Prescription Drug Card Programs (2004 and 2005) and the new Medicare Prescription Drug Insurance (called Medicare Part D – which is to be available in 2006).  The first thing that you have to figure out is whether or not you qualify for the $600 credit that is available to low-income Medicare Beneficiaries if you buy one of the Medicare Prescription Drug Cards.  Most people don't qualify.    So, do you qualify for the $600 credit under a prescription drug card plan?  In 2004, for singles, your income can be no more than $12,569. In 2004, for married couples, income can be no more than $16,862.    According to a recent research poll conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation, there is generally mass confusion concerning these new Prescription benefits in the Medicare program.  The bottom line “score” of the poll wound up being 36 (0 meaning very negatively viewed and 100 being most positively viewed).

The chart above is comparing 10 drugs purchased in one month from an average Canadian Pharmacy, and through 3 of the new Medicare Prescription Drug Card programs – Walgreens, RxSavings and Pharmacy Care Alliance (PCA).  The committee found that those 3 cards were fairly typical and closely represented all of the Prescription Drug Cards being offered through the program.  The average drug card price was 72% higher than Canadian purchases.  Walgreens’ Card had the lowest prices overall of the three, but were were still 60% higher than Canadian prices.    Here are some specific examples from the study:  Celebrex, the arthritis drug was priced at $81.28 with the Walgreens’ Medicare approved Prescription Drug Card, whereas the Canadian purchase of the exact same drug was only $38.69.  Prevacid, the ulcer medication, cost $129.68 with the PCA card – the Canadian price for Prevacid was only $56.54.  There are many meds available from Canada for less than half of the best price through the “cards.”    Though many Seniors could benefit from regular monthly prescription meds bought from Canada, in actuality, anyone with regular prescriptions, at any age, should check into the savings from Canadian purchases of their meds.  For example, in Columbia, Missouri, I did a comparison of Birth Control p
