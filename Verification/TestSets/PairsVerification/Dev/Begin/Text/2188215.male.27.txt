urlLink UGA may have lost its name .  This is the latest offensive maneuver is a pretty strange war between the University of Georgia and it's former fund-raising organization, the UGA Foundation.  Here's a brief lesson in the history of these two rivals  1.  last year Michael Adams, UGA's president, refused to extend the contract of Vince Dooley, the long time athletic director  2.  the UGA Foundation, filled with old frat boys, started whining and boo hooing and decided they wanted UGA to fired Michael Adams because they love Dooley.  3.  the Board of Regents that governs the University System of Georgia backed Adams and told the UGA Foundation that they can't influence school policy.  4.  the UGA Foundation decided that if they can't have it their way, they would just not pay Michael Adams the part of his salary that they normally provide.  This is analogous to them saying that if no one was going to play with them, they would take their ball and go home.  They also tried to hold their collective breath until someone paid attention to them, but no one did.   5.  the Board of Regents finally decided they had had enough and they  urlLink fired the UGA Foundation .  6.  the latest step and the title of this post.  the UGA Foundation now has the trademark to the term "the University of Georgia" and they are holding UGA hostage.  If the Board of Regents goes through with firing them, they will force the university to change it's name.  This is a pretty good move if you ask me.  It's going to ensure that firing the UGA Foundation won't be an easy process and all of this will have to resolved in court.
What an exciting day!  We just released the latest test for The Intelligent Shopping Process at  urlLink Autotrader.com.   To see it, enter your zip code and click "Find Your Car."  This will take you to the new search form.  We have made it much easier to find the car you want.  Before you had to enter at least a year and make which meant you had to have done some research somewhere else.  Now, you can search for anything you want.  We have options to search for new or used cars,  for particular body styles, by a price range, etc.  We are finally starting to live up to our commercials.  Remember, "I need a car... a blue car... no a truck."  Now, look for blue cars or trucks.  I was fortunate to be one of the developers who helped to create this, and I think it's the beginning of the future for Autotrader.com.
