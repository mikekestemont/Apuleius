Read from bottom to top:   My response:  Mr. hillbilly, your name fits you well.  Funny you say our Presidential candidate is lame, when yours was the worst President we've had to date regarding foreign relations, economy, environment, and possibly more.  It's funny how you don't realize that the "average joe" was screwed over by Bush's tax cuts.  It's funny how you don't realize that 2 million "average joe" jobs were lost in his first 2 years of presidency.  Also, not everyone on welfare can help it.  When will you Republicans realize it?  Not everyone was blessed with a good marriage with two hard working parents.  Not everyone was "blessed" with white skin color (although it does make some cocky--I'm half white/ half asian so you don't think I'm just saying this from an exclusively minority point of view).  Some of the people on welfare have 2 or 3 jobs and still can't support their family you insensitive hillbilly.    Also, we're not pulling out of Iraq, and John Kerry doesn't want to either.  We will still have our troops there so that the IRAQIS can govern, not Americans.  It's not our land.  You say that your elders fought in wars.   Funny thing is, YOUR president skipped National Guard duty (the administration won't release his military records....hmmmm...see link http://www.kentucky.com/mld/kentucky/news/special_packages/8986429.htm ), while John Kerry was a decorated war veteran from Vietnam. Enough talk already.  It seems like you and your President need to enlist in the army and get some "backbone".     hosshillbilly  IP: Logged Posted: 06/25 10:26p ET     This film is proof that the liberal left will stop at nothing to sway the weak minded passive American people into electing another lame president. If they suceed then they can marry their dogs and cats or anything else they want to with no reprecussions from the government. The average working stiff Joe can pay all the bills for their social welfare programs that cater to those that are to lazy to get a job. We can pull out of Iraq and set back and wonder just when the next attack will come from, or where it may be, or whose family may be there. Everyone will be a part of the Great U.S. of Rainbow Stew, and a chicken in every pot. I just wish that America had the same BACKBONE it had when my Great-Great-Grandfather fought with the 2nd Mississippi Infantry, or when his Great-Grandfather fought the British during the Revolutionary War, or when my uncle carried a malaria ridden soldier 22 miles in the Phillipines during WWII. People better WAKE up and figure out that there ARE NO FREE RIDES!
I find this very interesting, and he's probably right:   Recon  IP: Logged Posted: 06/26 1:23p ET     I saw the movie yesterday morning...sure it was slanted but for the most part I do think it was factual.  I knew when Bush ran for President how it would be.  I am from an Oil Company background and could see the deck being stacked....Condi Rice...(Chevron Board of Directors), Dick Cheney(Halliburton), GW (Harken Oil Co.)and Daddy Bush (
