The speech that US President George W. Bush, the most protected president in the world, made at Galatasaray University in Istanbul has reportedly contributed greatly to the security image and promotion of Turkey. In the background was the Ortakoy Mosque and the Bosphorous Bridge.  The Union of Tourism Agencies, Managers, and Enterprisers (TUROB) President, Timur Bayindir, said yesterday that the Bush speech sent the message that if Bush, the most protected president in the world, can make a speech calmly in such an open and beautiful place, then anyone can be safe in this country.   Bayindir emphasized that the fact that certain state heads came to Istanbul was highly beneficial for the promotion of Turkey on TV channels in those countries as they broadcasted views of Istanbul. He pointed out the importance of the Bosphorus view in the background. He said, "They were seen as positive images. To me, it was nice." He also said that by choosing a university for the speech showed the positive atmosphere in a country where the ones who oppose the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) consist mostly of youth.

These are intimidated by the fear that 'the Greeks will come, Turks will go.' The votes will be put into the ballot boxes with this anxiety and both camps are likely to have a close proportion of the votes. A contentiously close outcome is likely in the election. The ones with a clear decision this time are not sure how they will vote, while those who had always voted for Denktas are saying, they will vote for union parties this time, and vice versa. The concrete political structure has already cracked. The crack of a new change will be enlarged by the election. The demands for more democracy will force the solution.
