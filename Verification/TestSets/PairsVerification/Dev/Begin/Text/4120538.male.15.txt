Today was my last day of freedom. ha! Lisa and I went to the Great Mall and watch "The Village." It was ok. We took so much public transportation. ahh! Got lost a couple of times. haha. Talk more aboot it later. So tired. See you at school PEOPLE! night!
Tired, tired, tired. Woke up around 11:00am. I was supposed to be at SLA (buy books) at 11:00am. So got ready as fast as I could, because the book sale was going to close at 12:00p.m. I couldn't go get the books from 1:00p.m. - 3:00p.m. because of my basketball game. But all is good --got there around 11:30p.m. The only juniors I saw were Sam and Stephanie. Lots of freshmen. $288 bucks for books. WTF mate?       The Good News:   I HAVE A FULL LOCKER! Sweet MONKEYS!       We lost the bball game. BUT ALL IS sexy, because I scored 6 points --that's what counts. lmao. Went swimming after the game at the YMCA with my cousins. fun crap! I'm so funking tired. night . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . .. .. .. . ..
I had to get new pants for school today. I'm just growing like bamboo. Dockers all the way home doggy dodo. So gangSTER - I know. I also had to get some basketball pants. I tried on these black shorts, and they were very cozy, but then I looked in the mirror, and they were see through -bad bad idea.     Had basketball practice today. It's been a while, with vacation and all. One of my teamates dyed his hair pink for some reason. Everyone got a kick out of that. Gots a game tomorrow. Going to kick some ass!      Rented "Johnson Family Vacation." Kind of reminds me of my road trip to Canada, cept we didn't pick up a pyscho voo-doo hot girl hitchhiker that steals Fruit-Loop boxes. ha ha. night man/dudes/dudedetts (spelled wrong)/chicks/chickens/the homeless/Lindsay...yeah I'm done. NIGHT!
Went to Office Depot (why don't they pronounce the "t?") today, to get some school supplies. I went to the Office Depot in Mountain View because the one near me is evil, and unorganized, so I have no idea where anything is. MOTHER! School starts in exactly a week. ah! Why must summer go to the beyond? Also played some b-ball at the park. I'm getting better. I bought 2 locker shelves at Office Depot because they break to easy. Also walked to Walgreens, and on the way there these Asians near Tin-Tin Market were doing Tai-Chi or something. Really interesting. I tried copying them from a distance, didn't work out that well. ha ah ha ha.       Tomorrow I'm going to see a clown midget! She's very odd, she's tries to ryme everything! And sometimes the sentences turn out wrong. Don't ask. Well ask if your dying to know, which you all should be!!! ASK!      I'm going to watch the "Bend it like Bekham" movie again. night
School...not that excited about it.       The highLIGHT of my day was going to a moooovie with Moogan. W
