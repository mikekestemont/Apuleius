Not long after I crawled into bed the other night, Ethan came in and crawled in next to me.&nbsp; I was under the covers he was on top for all of you perverts.&nbsp; We talked about our friendship, how long we have been friends, and how much the three of us rely on each other.&nbsp; It was just nice, he was running his hand through my hair the way he always does when something is really weighing on his shoulder.&nbsp; Then the conversation diverted.... &nbsp; Ethan started talking about how&nbsp;our friendship will change as we get older.&nbsp; His biggest argument being that JAKE &amp; I should consider taking our relationship to the next level regardless of the friendship.&nbsp; His rationale behind this is that if any of us ever do get in a committed relationship the friendship will begin to fall apart and we will spend less and less time together.&nbsp; If JAKE &amp; I make a serious relationship out of what we already have then at least that friendship will be kept in tact.&nbsp; This of course made me cry.&nbsp; I hate it when he talks about the end of the friendship between the 3 of us.&nbsp; It is like thinking about death.&nbsp; No one wants to die, no one really knows what it feels like when it happens, and everybody hurts.&nbsp;  &nbsp; The BOOTLEG BAND has six members ETHAN, JAKE and myself along with 3 more of our friends KURT, MATT, and DAMON.&nbsp; Being in a band has never been easy on the friendship between the six of us so this feeling of loss is nothing new to me.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I am now convinced that I have misread ETHAN's feelings for me&nbsp;so after some thought I told him that I would think about it. &nbsp; Then he proceeded to tell me that he would not be going to MEXICO with us.&nbsp; He said that JAKE already knew that he would not be going, but I should let JAKE know if I am still going to go.&nbsp; I told him that I was still going, but it would not be the same without him. &nbsp; So I was crying like a baby at this point... JAKE stayed and held me most of the night.&nbsp; When he left the next morning, I stayed in bed and cried some more.&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;
A good portion of SHADY CREEK runs through my land.  Many years back, JAKE, ETHAN and I asked my parents if we could use an old tire and some rope to make a rope swing down by the creek.  We have spent a lot of time back there... fishing, swimming, laughing. When my parents were killed in a tragic motorcycle accident a few years back, that swing became a place where I could go to have a good cry all by myself.  JAKE and ETHAN have never let me cry by myself.  They have always given me a friendly shoulder to cry on.  Today is the 6 year anniversary of their death and I had a rough day.  JAKE & E
