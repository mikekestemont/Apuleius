Yesterday I just laid around all day pretty much and watched Lifetime Movie Network.. Then my mom came home and we went to Red Lobster to get that Lobster and Shrimp thing for like 14.99. It was really good. And while we were there I saw Ashley Matias there, which was wierd b/c it was soo far away. Then we went grocery shopping and spent 100 dollars worth on junk. it was pretty uneventful really.   Today I woke up at like 11:15 or so. Then it started pouring down rain and the power flicked off. I had also let Ollie Bear outside and then it started pouring so I kept trying to call him in and he never came. He finally came in but he was soaking wet so I dried him off with a towel and held him. Now I'm watching another Lifetime movie called Touch of a Stranger. It is really good so far. After this is over I think I'm gonna go take a nap and be even more lazy than usual.
So me and Chris are back together again. I know I may be making the wrong decision. But I really do care about him and he means everything to me right now. So I figure I better give it another try. Anywayz I hung out with Beth Chris Adan and Brian tonight.. again. I had alot fun.. Adan came over with some beer and for some strange reason I had this urge to like drink the whole thing in like 2 seconds. So then I threw up and I felt so bad that I threw up in Adan's car. So that's the last time that I'll be drinking for a long time, I'm sorry to say. Beth and Adan were really flirting on the way home. Chris drove us home and so Adan and Beth sat in the backseat. They are good together I guess except for the 7 year age difference.   Anywayz at my dad's I did absolutely nothing the entire day. I finished a book which was really good. Then about 5:45 we started going back to my house and I drove us there. He's not used to me driving so of course he was all nervous and everything but oh well. Then I got home and we went to Kohl's where I got 2 shirts which cost my mom like 30 dollars which isn't much. But I might take back one of them if it doesn't match this skirt.   Well I think I'm gonna call Chris.. I'm soo glad we're back together.. He is my everything. Nothing his love won't bring. My life is his alone. The only love I've ever known.

Well I'm a perfect example of the quote-- "if he fools you once, shame on him; if he fools you twice, shame on you"-- somethign to that extent.. Me and Chris now broke up again... I really did think he cared about me. So we were on the phone and I said well if we have another b
