We haven't had a drink. Promise.  We've opened a betting account each, and deposited ten bucks in each.  We will come back at the end of the week (ie Friday if you please chaps) to get a run down on how much we've won/lost/frittered away.
Now then chaps. Since this is perhaps the geeks version of doing a car up, see if you can make some sense of  urlLink this article  Mr P. W. Heaney.  I'm positive the site can have a musical background, that would be a cool feature. And of course Lily and her "impressive baps" as Pete so eloquently put it is on hand with thumbnail tips. Though why we want a manicure is beyond me. Ho-ho!  What would our regular readers think to a template change? You know where to comment.  So I've decided to take up  urlLink Beatlism  as my new religion, all makes perfect sense to me. There are some strange people about isn't there.  Smashed my head with my car door tonight. Actually took me a minute to regain where I was and who I was! Nearly knocked me out. Right in the wars this past few days after me run in with the Truck doors yesterday (a truck door hit me in the back at very high speed). First one to complete Roadies gets a free drink on the rich man - me. Cheers for the Â£80 Mr Groves. I like a man who pays his debts.

It amounted to me nearly getting crippled by an onrushing goal keeper, letting a throw in go through my legs, nutmegging a bald fella and taking 2 of the worst corners in western europe.  Came off at half time to be replaced by what appeared to be Shaun Ryder's skinny brother.
urlLink Great game.
In CDT (Craft Design and Technology for all you acronym freaks out there) once upon a time, I saw a belt sander majestically soar off a workbench and leave a 2 metre long trail as smooth as a babies arse on the newly varnished floor. It would still be going now but for the inadequacies of the power cable.  It sort of resembled one of those weird  urlLink programmable tank  things you could get years ago.  Hilarity prevailed. Or did it? Or DID it? OR DID IT?  Yes, it did.
Tonights the night........No seriously, I havce consumed 7 pints of Stella Artois, which is strong lager, am I entitled to more than 2 Units a pint, considering its stella??  If not I have had 14 units so far this week!  What have you Kids Bellies had??
Will Peter be able to move again after his magnificent effort for Brian "I'm blind in one eye, but I still play in goal" Millers football team this evening? I seriously doubt it but full marks for being bold enough to get down there and give it some on the astroturf. Oooh, matron.  Keith secured 14 units on the Drinks-o-meter tonight. Does he score bonus points for it being on a school night?   7 pints o
