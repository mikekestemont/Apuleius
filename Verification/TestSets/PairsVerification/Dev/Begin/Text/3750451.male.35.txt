I don't freaking believe this!  So today I get to work, and there is an email from aother QA person, asking me to come and get a QA from her.  I go over, and she states that it was the one I was supposed to get last week.  My heart dropped.  What was it?  A major screw up or what?  IT WAS ONLY A FREAKING PERFECT SCORE!  What the hell did her email last week make it sound like it was urgent, and that I'd messed up big time?  I just don't get it.  Son't people realize that email is a powerful medium, and can carry messages you don't think are really in there?  Memo to all....re-read email before sending it, and make sure it's giving the message you wish to send.  OK, that's my 5 cents.  That's also all for now...I'm off to watch a new episode of Joe Schmo 2 on Spike TV.  Have a groovy time, till next posting that is! Lee
Morning all....  SO it's 9.30, and only 2 hours before I have to leave for work, and yep, once again my stomach is ready for throwing up.  I've already taken 3 long trips to the bathroom, and I'm thinking another is in order fairly soon.  I think I need to find a new job, but I'm having a midlife crisis right now, and don't really know what I want to do with my life.....kinda sucks really!  Let's see if I can make it through the day without a headache....I get pounding headaches almost every day, and unfortunatly there is only one way I can get rid of it, and that's with 4 Excedrin tension headache pills which I highly recommend, but I have a feeling my liver is going to be sorry later in life.  OK, I suppose I'd better get some cafine in my system to get things going, so have a groovy day and we'll see what happens today.  Lee
Alrighty then....  First chance I've had to follow up since Friday, but here we go with what happened on the QA she needed to see me about, and that I was worried about since Thursday night....SHE NEVER FREAKING CONTACTED ME, AND NOW SHE IS ON HOLIDAY FOR 2 DAMN WEEKS!!!!  Anyway, so now I have 2 weeks possibly to fret about this crap....damn, am I pissed off!  Anyway, we have a new supervisor starting on Monday, so I guess we'll see what happens.  I'm at the point in my life where I feel like I need to do something exciting as a career, but I'm not sure what.  I used to write for computer magazines back in England, and I worked in radio for about 5 years for the BBC as a PA/presenter, and would love to get back into that....but it's not that easy.  Anyway, I have to go to make dinner right now, but if anyone is  actually reading this, then HELLO, and if not.....at least it's getting things off my chest!
Alrighty, the reason I created this is often I just need to g
