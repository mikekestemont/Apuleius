Taking senior portraits was a blast!! The photographers where so nice,they made me laugh a lot! They had music playing and I was dancing around and stuff. I got some pics taken with my french horn and stuff but my favorites were the outside pictures. There were horses in the field next to the place and the guy(Bill Miller) said that they were ornery and most people didn't get to take pictures with them, but guess what... I did! aha Miller was like now feed her, but don't feed her, and look at the camera, now don't let her get the grass yet, but look at the camera! I was like ook you're trying to get my finger bit off! Anyhow Micheal Hill came in right after I did and then Lee did his.. but I think overall they are going to be some good pictures(expecially the ones outside!!). So now I'm tired and I'm gunna take a nap!!
I am sitting here all made up waiting to go for my senior pics, and I'm thinking to myself 'why do we put ourselves through this'? I have come to the conclusion that people are generally just plain stupid, and that is why we have to look our best and take pictures to show it off(not like mine are gunna be any good or anything). So while I wait I am gunna rant about how superficial people generally are. Why do we have to look good? I have no problem looking like a slob and going out in public, I do it all the time. But to some people if they see someone looking grundgy they think that that person is poor or stupid or something. Just because I don't feel like taking 30 minutes out of my day to fix my hair or put on make-up or pick out cute clothes doesn't mean I am poor and it doesn't mean that I don't care about myself. It just means that I don't care what other people think and maybe I just don't feel like it! hmm I feel better now. Hee, well I am off the see the wizard, wish me luck!
