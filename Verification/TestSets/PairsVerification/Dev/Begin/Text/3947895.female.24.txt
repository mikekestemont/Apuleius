I have had a special request for blogging so here I am.  It is Friday and for that I am thankful but I have nothing useful or funny to say.  It doesn't feel like a Friday in my office and I am stuck at my desk doing all sorts of un-fun crap.  If anyone would like to brighten my day I would greatly appreciate it.  Otherwise I will be sittin here thinking about my bed and a beer.

I saw part of the Facts of Life reunion show last night.&nbsp; Mrs. Garrett is really old now and I think they killed off Joe.&nbsp; Must have been some sort of motorcycle accident.&nbsp; Even though that show wasn't that great I found myself becoming very nostalgic as I remembered watching the show on summer mornings when I was in school.&nbsp; Oh those were the good ol days.&nbsp;        &nbsp;   On another note, it seems that summer finally hit Chicago.&nbsp; It is a great day outside and a great day for a BBQ.&nbsp; Happy 1/2 Birthday Heather!!!&nbsp; We'll put some candles in some S'mores for ya!
How great of a movie is Reality Bites?&nbsp; I never really watched it before this past weekend and I was amazed.&nbsp; First off, Ethan Hawke is a babe.&nbsp; Second, there are soo many good quotes (he'll turn this place into a den of slack).&nbsp; How can you not love it?&nbsp; I also watched Say Anything right afterwards.&nbsp; Cusak is also a babe in that movie.&nbsp; "My plans are to spend as much time as possible with your daughter."&nbsp; Who says that to a dad?&nbsp; I laughed for about 5 minutes.&nbsp;
This is a shout out to K-dog.&nbsp; What up
In addition to leaving my much-loved pseudo Juicy Tube at home, I also left my cell phone.&nbsp; I feel like I lost my right arm or something.&nbsp; When exactly did I become so dependent on that thing.&nbsp; I have a perfectly good land line sitting next to me on my desk but I feel as if the world came to an end I wouldn't know because I don't have my cellie!
So I show up at work this morning and realize that I have stupidly left my lip gloss at home.&nbsp; Now for those of you who know me, and especially those who went out with me on Saturday night, you know that I am addicted to that Clinique stuff.&nbsp; It is like crack.&nbsp; I'm not sure how I will get through the day without it.&nbsp; I'm already shaking...
AGGHHH week from hell really.&nbsp; It is over in T minus 12 minutes.&nbsp; Was this week as bad for anyone else or was it just my office?       &nbsp;   On another note, I want to thank everyone who has made my first full week of blogging a success.&nbsp; Thank you Laura for always believing in me, thank you Wendy for always making me laugh, thank you Kellett for being an eskimo and many thanks to Erin with her eat a sandwich jokes.&nbsp; Without you all I n
