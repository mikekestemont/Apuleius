I'll start this off by introducing myself.  My full name's Loo Li Ling Jenna, which i've always found weird, seeing as how normal babies would be baptised Jenna Loo Li Ling, if they were going to be named that at all. Of course, if your parents didn't like the name Jenna, but preferred, say, Mary, well, then they would name you Mary Loo, or whatever your surname was. And if you were as unfortunate as to be born a boy, why, then you'd be named neither Mary nor Jenna but some masculine name like Kevin or Nebuchanezzer.            Now you may be thinking that my entries are going to be super long, seeing as how i took up a whole paragraph telling you my name. It reminds one of Treebeard, and Entish. I'll make the rest of it snappy.           I have shoulder length black hair, with dark brown eyes and brown spectacles. I'm about 162 cm tall, and am pretty tanned. I go to SMK Sri Permata, where i love to eat the fresh watermelon that the nice canteen lady sells. Oh yeah, i'm going to be 16 in August.           Why 'No Apologies'? I just came back from the No Apologies Camp my church ran in Peacehaven, Genting, where i learnt about love, life, and sex. A lot of question that i had inside of me, about relationships, love, and the like were answered at the camp. How far can one go with a guy, and all that.            No Apologies . That's what i'll aim for. I'll live my life with that in mind. I guess the one truth that stood out most  for me was abstinence (from premarital sex) really gives you freedom. Freedom from STDs( sexually transmitted diseases), unwanted pregnancy, emotional damage. I'll be free to save myself for the one guy i'll spend the rest of my life with. Don't you think it's so beautiful and special that you have one gift that you can save for your spouse?             No Apologies . I will never apologise for sticking to God's Word. I know there will be many, many instances when it will be easier to lie, or to leave someone to their own problems. Many times when doing the right thing will cause people to hate me.  No apologies.           Angelic, huh? Hey, there are many things i've struggled with. There is one thing that i haven't completely overcome yet. That one thing has caused me to fall from God so many,many,many times before. When will i have the final victory? I do it, and ask for forgiveness, and then i do it again. The only way i'll ever get over it is by getting strength from Jesus. He forgives me readily, He loves me completely, and I know i'll never be alone again. Still knowing and feeling are sometimes two completely different things.  Love, Jenna  p.s. my old blog was  urlLink www.xanga.com/jenna_loo
