His Holiness the Dalai Lama  of Tibet   I offer the following concise teachings as a foundation for an understanding of the structure and practice of Tibetan Buddhism.  I have nothing to say that has not been said before.  Do not look upon these teachings on a path leading to the transformation of your mind.  Only then will these teachings be of true benefit.Before Buddhism arrived, the Bon religion was widespread in Tibet.  Until recently, Bon study centers still existed in Tibet.  Not an effective religion at first, Bon was greatly enriched by Buddhist belief and practice.  Around the eighth century CE, King Lha-Tho-Ri Nyen-Tsen introduced Buddhism to Tibet.  Since then, Buddhism has spread steadily.  Over the course of time, many Indian  pandits (scholars) came to Tibet and translated sutras, Tantric texts, and commentaries.  During the reign of the irreligious King Lang-Dar-Mar in the 10th century CE, Buddhism suffered a setback, but that eclipse was short-lived, Buddhism soon revived and spread again, starting in the western and eastern parts of Tibet; Indian and Tibetan scholars were again busyu translating religious texts.  As the number of Tibetan Buddhist scholars grew, the number of visiting Indian scholars gradually declined. Thus, in the later period of Tibetan Buddhism, our religion developed independently of the later school of Indian Buddhism, although it retained the foundations of the Buddha's teachings.  In its essentials,  Tibetan Buddhism never suffered alterations or additions at the hands of Tibetan lamas.  Their commentaries are clearly identifiable as commentaries, and for their authority, they referred to the main teachings of Lord Buddha or the works of the Indian pandits.  For this reason, I do not think it is correct to regard Tibetan Buddhism as separate from the original Indian Buddhism, or to refer to it as lamaism.  The Four Noble Truths  Buddha said, "This is true suffering; this is the true cause; this is true cessation; this is the true path."  He also said, "Know the nature of suffering; give up the causes of suffering; attain the cessation of suffering; follow the true path." And he said, "Know suffering, although there is nothing to know.  Relinquish the causes of misery, although there is nothing to relinquish.  Be earnest in pursuit of cessation, although there is nothing to cause.  Practice the means of cessation, although there is nothing to practice."  These are three views of the intrinsic nature, action, and ultimate result of the Four Noble Truths.  In the third century CE, the Indian Nagarjuna expounded the philosophy of the Middle Way, which has become central to all schools of Mahayana Buddhism.  The Middle Way teaches that "true suffering" derives from samsara, the cycle of birth and rebirth that arises from karma, the retribution for actions stemming from ignorance and delusion.  "True cause" means karma and delusion, which are the true causes of suffering.  "True cessation" means the complete disappearance of the two preceding conditions.  The "true path" is the one path by which we arrive at true cessation.  Hinayana  To a
