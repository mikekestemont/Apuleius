This is both an introduction and conclusion, as the title implies.  I have been blogging for four months.  Blogging has become a part of my routine, a way of exploring myself, and a way of exploring the boundaries of the virtual world and the real one.  I have come to believe that the online world gives us a unique opportunity to be more open, more creative, and more true to ourselves, by providing a thin covering between us and others.  This thin veil is protective; it keeps us from being wounded by never really exposing all that we could, keeps the social order of things intact.  In real life, we are forced to constructed this veil, and it keeps us from making all of the deep connections that we could, and forces us to use creative energy that would be better spent in building knowledge of who we are.  In the virtual world, that veil is constructed for us.  We are able to express ourselves in new and deeper ways not having to worry that we will be pushed to the outside.  On the net, we are given a confessional screen of anonymity, and with that already in place we are able to begin reconstructing ourselves in a way that is closer to who we think that we really are.    The following entries are attempting to talk about blogs in this way.  They are meant to be read from the first to the latest entry.  I suggest going to the entry log on the right hand side of the screen and starting from the bottom and moving up.  I have made links possible where the material was online.  Below I have provided a works cited so that if you want to be old school about my sources you can find them.  I hope that this adds to the discussion that is currently in place around web journaling.    And remember: “ urlLink A blog gives you your own voice on the web.  It’s a place to collect and share things that you find interesting- whether it’s your political commentary, a personal diary, or links to web sites you want to remember… what ever you have to say, Blogger can help you say it”     Works Cited:   Cohhaim, Wallys.

McNeill makes the claim that blogs are blurring the line between reality and virtual reality.  I have discussed this in several other sections of the paper, and think that in this, my second to last section it is important to revisit.  The online journal blurs lines in several ways: The blog c
