We went strawberry picking yesterday at this farm called Rae's near Brittania and Trafalgar. It was a different experience...first it's an organic farm (no pesticides!) so there were a lot of weeds growing everywhere around the strawberry plants. I think I'm used to the neat little rows most farms grow their produce in. Second, there was a really mean old lady! She yelled at Vivian and Alex right at the beginning because according to her, they weren't supposed to be in the area -- we were supposed to stay in the area we were assigned to. What kind of stupidness is that? If there aren't any strawberries in one area we move on to the next until we find some! I didn't even know we were "assigned" an area. Both Vivian and Alex were quite annoyed (well, pissed actually) with her.   I got yelled at too. I sort of wandered off on my own and then when I tried to go back to where everyone else was, that stupid lady asked me (in a not very nice manner) where I was going. Hello it's just a strawberry patch! I think she was senile.    urlLink    me in an overgrown strawberry field
I can't believe it but I've started to watch anime on YTV again! Every Friday night at 10 pm I'm like, omg I have to watch Inu-Yasha!! haha I'm so weird. But it's my brother's fault! He never stopped watching cartoons on tv and I don't think he'll ever stop. The show is done in the style of Sailor Moon...with the big eyes and the long legs. I'm not sure what the style is called officially. So this totally reminds me of when I used to watch Sailor Moon when I was in high school. It used to be on at 12 noon everyday (I can't believe I still remember that) and I still have the Sailor Moon stickers and a poster somewhere. I have a Sailor Moon sticker on my flute case too!! hehe. I never play my flute anymore...and my dad bugs me about it sometimes. But that's another story. That goes along with the piano that sits in the living room that never gets played :p  So from Sailor Moon I got hooked on Dragon Ball. Then it was Macross Plus (which I still really like). Then a bunch of anime films I don't remember the names to. Oh yeah and Pokemon and Digimon!! HAHAHA...I actually have a HUGE pikachu plush toy that doubles as a pillow that Vivian gave me. Escaflowne is one of my favourites too. haha good times, good times...
Things are so different at York now! First there are the nice signs they have for the buildings and also for the street names. New buildings everywhere (the Technology and Enhanced Learning Building is so cool and there's Tim Hortons and other food in there! Right behind CFA!! I'm always happy when the food is closer...)  And they used a super big tent for convocation this year. It was fun! Young and I went uninvited to t
