Is there a distinction between the modes of the mind and body of an igneous rock? I'd like some answers. It seems apparent however, that the mind and body of an igneous rock, are as one corporeal mode, occuring through entirely naturalistic causes.  This is an interesting thought, but one question more interesting is whether rocks have free-will, or do they have predetermined destinies? I'm currently tending towards a Calvinistic view with regards to inanimate objects.  Ever wondered how Plato's  The Republic , would have turned out if Socrates had have been a 4 foot tall Panda Bear? I'm thinking it would have been a little different--- and rather hard to translate.  Edit: I've recently realised that having Socrates as a 4 foot tall Panda Bear would produce some logistical problems in ancient Greece, considering the climate and lack of cold water fish. It also may merely not have worked, considering that Socrates did have a speaking role
I was informed recently of a group in New Zealand, rallying against the government in what they believe to be 'immoral decisions'. Let's begin by saying that the New Zealand government, is the most democratic government in the world- they have referendums! It is these referendums that this group is fighting against. Now, I call myself a Christian, but so do the members of this group. I will not be associated with such a fascist group of political neophytes with objective ethics that scream "truth" and shut down any whimper of tolerance. Hypocrites.
Death and/or Taxes   Death and/or taxes’, that’s the latest craze according to à la mode tax accountant Frank Walsh. “The post-modern era of erratic movements and elegant hand waving has been succeeded by the pre-post-post-modern fad of death and/or taxes”, Frank told a man purchasing a tyre from K-mart yesterday evening, “it’s all the rage in this neo-platonic society of the future, for one to ‘drop dead and cough up’, or merely do one of the previous without having to perform the other action”. Frank, who spotted the rising trend in the summer of 1994, informed the woman standing next to the man buying the tyre that she ought to purchase herself “a casket or a tax book”, in preparing for what he calls, “the Die and/or Can’t afford to buy” revolution.  Walsh is not the only high profile taxation officer predicting this somewhat dramatic shift in the preferred metaphysical basis of populism. Bob Lough and his taxation team at Unemployed Accountants International, have been training a budgerigar from ‘Tim’s Pets and Pet Accessories’, to formulate an algorithm to predict the popular trends in the main stream senile culture- including lawyers and dentists. This budgerigar has predicted an identical trend to that of Frank Walsh’s, which indicates the truth in this seemingly sensible prediction.  Another side to this new to be fashionable trend, is the methods in which one performs these soon-to-be popular acts. Just how does one die fashionably? To answer this, one must curtail their activities and get themselves along to the trendiest crematorium in town. Here it is f
