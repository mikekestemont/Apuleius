Ahoy there fellow mateys!!  Yesterday consisted of many new entries to the annals of funny things.  Man, i need to think of a better name for those damn annals.  Anyway, i went to kerry's party, which was in freakin nowheresville, but it was worth it because i love her.  The place was great,  a lake for swimmin' and boatin' and lookin-for-snakes-n'.  There were numerous couches and tables for talking and playing cards, an indoor volleyball court, thousands of dollars worth of musical equipment,  and fooseball/airhockey/pingpong/pool tables as far as the eye can see.  There was an equally cool field for frizbeing, which we did a great deal of.  The highlight of the evening was the frisbee playing.  We had way too many people to play without confusion, but it was the crazed atmosphere that made it fun.  Jimmy and Chris Bopp were in a constant struggle.  Stacy was trying to pump her team up, until she gave up and joined chrissie on the sidelines.  Danielle managed to kick ass and dance at the same time.  Alex almost got sexually harrassed by a group of burly guys, and Moira almost got sexually harrassed by one VERY CREEPY burly guy (look on the bright side sunshine... *shiver*).  Me and Jackie played a lot of not-running-but-still-trying defense, and Bowyer kept messing with us and calling us out.    Oh, by the way, i decked bowyer  hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha  There was a bonfire and lots of good times, and if i'm forgetting anything about the party, please leave a comment and tell me, it was really late when i got home and it's really late now, so i don't remember a whole lot.  Anyway, on the car ride home... i swear those s'mores were drugged...  Chrissie's dad was driving us home and somehow the conversation turned to 'fookies', a mysterious combination of ferrets and cookies.  Then i fell asleep with dirty, dirty feet from frisbee.  I'll leave you with a final deep thought  After you dip your dead ferrets in melted chocolate, roll them in cookies quickly, because that chocolate dries fast!!  Jess
So here's the story morning glory:  I had a really stupid fight with my mom, that normally would have gotten me zero punishment, but since we were off to a high stress day at grandpops, and my mom was going 'mad' i was grounded.  Don't be so alarmed, it was originally two weeks, then one week, then the weekend.   Anyway, theres a lot of ground to cover.  As we were leaving school on thursday, me and alex managed to finagle TWELVE history books.  It was really funny to see a group of us each carrying one or two books around.  Just thought i should throw that out there.  On thursday, the last day of school, what do me and my dorky friends do?  Go to a bookstore.  Get this!  At said bookstore, we all decided we liked books so much that we would start a BOOK CLUB!!  Yeah, we're cool.  After the bookstore, we thoroughly destroyed Chrissies house.
