I saw a show on discovery about the Komodo dragon, and they mentioned that it has a "mouth full of putrefaction" while showing an ox dying from an infected bite wound. Sounds like me when I wake up. I had to switch to all-cotton pillows because I kept melting the polyester ones.  "No E-mail, only hot dog." -sony commercial. "Psst! It's me - Death. I'll see you soon, OK? I know you can't hear me, but try to feel what I'm about to say, deep down in your soul - Don't eat the gazpachooo."                                       -Manny Calavera, "Grim Fandango"
So, Here is the first entry into my  Blogger  powered pseudo-journal. wait - meta-journal. no... um... "Journalesque Stream Of Thought." (Journalesque Stream Of Thought &copy; 1972 eclipse studios) So, if this works, I shall have a place on my website which I can use to post random thoughts that wouldn't quite fit into anything else. I already have a section for this (core), but that is more for structured rants and such. At this point in time I would like to say "Eugene" 4 times: Eugene Eugene Eugene Eugene. I would also like to state that Escargot is a really bad name for snails. They should be labeled "Snails" in bold print. just to let you know, so you don't order them while trying to show off for a date or something ("Ah kin reed fraynch, gimme one of them thar escargots"). The menu should say in large text just above the name of the dish: "NOTICE: There are snails in this dish. If you order it, you will be expected to eat multiple snails"

I am Tiger Woods&copy; wearing Michael Jordan&copy; cologne and Nike&copy; sneakers in my Buick&copy; listening to the Britney Spears&copy; cd I got from McDonalds&copy;. Did domebody say McDonalds&copy;? uh, Yeah, I just did.

Oh yeah, Mir isn't gonna be scrapped after all. Turns out, somebody raised enough money to buy all that space-lysol, and they won't send Mir spiraling into the earth in february. The space-fungus was unavailable for comment. Somebody needs to make a movie about the heroic space-lysol. SPAAAAAAAAAAAACE LYYYYYYYYSOOOOOLLLLLLLLL  IN THE 21ST CENTURY!!!!!!!!

Trust me - I checked an awful lot to make sure I felt like less of a man than I should. What I'm trying to say is, I've never seen "First Blood" all the way thru. In fact, I think the only Stallone movie I have seen all the way thru was Demolition man. I think I am less of a man because of this, and I need to get tough and go rent all 17 rocky movies and watch them s
