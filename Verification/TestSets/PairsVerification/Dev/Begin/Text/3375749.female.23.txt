It's going to be a beautiful Memorial Day....spent driving the bev-cart. Blah. I always end up working the damn holidays. That place is going to miss me when I quit. And that won't be too much longer I tell ya. Anyhow, I guess when I get off work, around 5, Jeff and I are going to go over to Rick and Diems for some BBQ. Diem makes good food too so I'm all about it. Yesterday Jeff and I went over to a party in DeLand that my cousin was having with some of his friends. I wouldn't really call it a party. There were like 10 of them at the most and they were cooking and drinking. You had to sit outside b/c it was cooler outside than it was in their house. No kidding! I couldn't live in a place like that. Their landlord won't install an air conditioner for them. I'd move. I only went to the party b/c Bryan has been inviting me to hang out for a while now, and I'd always have some kind of excuse not too, but this time I had nothing. We stayed for a couple hours. It wasn't too bad. I ended up knowing one of the girls. Her name is Laura Ray but she goes by her middle name now, Lane. Well I'm rambling and I'm going to stop so I can get dressed for work. Yay. I hope everyone has a great Memorial Day!
Thinking about going to the beach today, but having to think really hard about whether or not I want to fight all those people for a parking spot. It's going to be insanely crowded, I'm sure of it. Probably just getting to the beach will take me forever! Maybe I should just wait until next weekend and lay out by the pool instead. Yeah. I forgot this was Memorial Day Weekend until yesterday. I have to work it anyways. Back in the day I used to go to Juniper Spring with my best friend and her family. It's a 7 mile canoe run. We used to have a blast. Ahh...the good ol' days. They probably still go, but I haven't hung out with Emily in  FOREVER.  I miss her. Well I have nothing exciting to write about today. I think I'm going to just hang out by the pool and enjoy the nice weather.
Jeff's been working a LOT these past couple of days. Looks like the whole month of June will be the same way. This is a great thing though. He started his own business back in January. He builds fences for a living. He just landed a 26,000 foot job, which is what he'll be doing for all of June. He'll make great money with that job too, even though he's got practically all of it spent already. He just bought a new truck and tractor, and now he wants a new trailer and 4-wheeler. Go figure. I should be understading and stuff about how he works ALL day out in the hot s
