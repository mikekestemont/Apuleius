How did we get so far into the year already? Time is slipping by...and it's the perfect time to decandle your Japanese black pines. Short needles have long been the ideal on these trees, and for years, withholding water and fertilizer was recommended to achieve this goal. Unfortunately, this weakens the trees excessively and unnecessarily. Proper decandling technique avoids this while also balancing the vigor of the branches.  Who should decandle? Anyone who has well-developed branches and is ready to start training their tree for short needles. The tree should be fertilized heavily from the beginning of spring until now. To balance vigor on the tree, divide the candles mentally into four groups: strongest, strong, weak, weakest. Leave the weakest alone. This week, using very sharp shears, remove the weak candles at the base, being sure to cut straight across. One week to ten days later, remove the strong candles. And another week to ten days later, remove the strongest candles.   By removing the weakest candles first, the new buds which appear have a little headstart and so get stronger. The strongest candles are thus held back by two weeks. This is one aspect of balancing the vigor of Japanese black pines. Another aspect is removal of needles. Some of this may be done now on extremely vigorous branches, but mostly it will wait until autumn.  As soon as the candles are cut, remove all fertilizer from the black pines. This way we can control how big the new needles become. Water normally.  What else am I doing now? It will soon be time to defoliate healthy, well-developed trident maples. My only trident at this time was just dug this spring, and so it is far too soon to use defoliating techniques. This year will be devoted specifically to establishing the tree in its box.  The baby JBPs are doing quite well. They were wired this spring and are growing quite well. The wire is starting to bite and swell the trunks. I will leave the fertilizer on these for the entire year, but I will be removing the wire before the bark grows around it. These are wired in order to make the trunk swell, giving added girth and quicker development. A number of them are sending out adventitious buds down low, which will help tremendously in the future development. Next spring they will be transplanted into mesh pots for accelerated growth. I am following carefully the article from Bonsai Today #20, except that the trees were one year old plugs instead of seeds. I root-pruned the plugs last spring, arranged the roots, and planted them in six-inch nursery pots. I got about two years'growth last season, excited about this year.  Finished the back of the garage yesterday, and ready to build the shed. I will then be working on the display and growing areas. Hope to have pics to show by then.  Good luck to all my friends in the bonsai world!  Chris
I figured it's about time I started posting more often, something that's a little harder with a
