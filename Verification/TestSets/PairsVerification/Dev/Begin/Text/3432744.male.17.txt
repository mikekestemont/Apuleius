Hey!  It's been a while since I last posted, I know.  I was gone all weekend up to a summer camp for staff orientation (Going to be working up there from July 3-July 30 so not much updating will happen then, if any).  It's a Christian camp and the first day was devoted to the spiritual side of our job and the second was the standard "If A Kid Goes Missing, Do This" kind of day.  The first day though, we had 40 minutes to go anywhere in the camp and be alone (because the theme of the summer is "Be still, and know that I am God." Psalm 46:10) because in the silence, God speaks to you.  I don't know about everyone else, but my 40 minutes was spent figuring out my social life and when it was all done, a lot was sorted out.  1 - Hates      This one I had before I went up.  There had been a lot of people I've hated the past two months and at one point or another, every one of my friends had something negative/cruel said about them in one way or another.  I had narrowed my list down to one simple hate: The New Boyfriend (and technically the entity he and my ex form when they're together.  It's like watching Voltron when they're together :D) 2 - Why?      This was what needed sorting out.  I thought I hated him because of his "fondling her + looking me in the eyes" crap that he pulled on me, but I knew it had to run deeper than that.  And I realized something.  Although she'll NEVER admit to it, whether she's afraid to hurt my feelings or she doesn't conciously believe it herself, she dumped me to be with him.  There's no other logical reasoning that can explain why she hooked up with him after one week.  And when I look at him, I know that he's better than me.  There's something about him that makes him better than me.  There's something more dateable/likeable/boyfriendable in him that I never had or don't have.  I can be with him because of this feeling that he is better.  I see how happy she is with him and that just shows there's something he has that I never can have and actually makes her start to like him while dating me.  So that's why I hate him and that's why I want to see him suffer. 3 - Her      I don't hate her.  One of the things we learned up at the orientation was to act like brothers towards your girl friends (not romance, friends who are girls :D).  Whether or not this meant in the spiritual/metaphysical "Sisters in Christ" ideal or just in general, I'm not sure.  All I know is that I want to be there for all of my girls who are friends.  And this sounds like a spiritual contradiction (not forgiving him and being caring towards others) but its very difficult, right now, for me to say I can forgive him.  There a
