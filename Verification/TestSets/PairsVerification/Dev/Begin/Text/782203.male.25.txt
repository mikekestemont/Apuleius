Ok today is going to be a pretty boring day..im still reinstalling all my software on my new hard disk which the dell fellow gave on tuesday....and for some reason while im doing that im listening to Coldplay's Troubles again and again and again ....Dun know why i love this song so much cos they basically ripped off Radiohead's sound but hell yeah i love it........Went out with Ivan to the gym yesterday and a movie afterwards.... Saw a pretty hot looking gal in the gym there that made me work out that much harder but now im feeling the pain and kinda regretting it :( after that went to watch Bend It Like Beckham , pretty funny movie but the shittiest thing happened while we were watching the show this kid sneaked up to our row peeked at us and went back to his friends and they all started giggling like the idiots they were .....anyway they were sec school kids so i figured no point confronting them .....but it really pissed me off .ok later i got to go sign up for my advanced thery test but just damm lazy to go cos no one is at home so just feel like lazing ard at home with no one to nag at me ........oh well maybe i will go to the library instead much nearer ...see how lah .......damm i got to stop typing "......" ......ok thats all i got to say now .......
Just Saw the sadddest movie i seen in a while ...Its Dancer in the Dark starring one of my fav musicians bjork.Thanks to my recently acquired broadband connection i manage to dl it although it took me like a week! anyway the wait was well worth it cos the movie is really something, bjork plays this factory worker from czechklosvakia who is losing her sight , its hereditary , so shes saving up money for an operation for her son so that he wun go blind as well. To escape this grim reality she daydreams that she is in a musical becos like she says , "nothing bad happens in a musical". halfway during the movie a quick succession of tragedies occur and her life rapidly takes a turn for the worse and her daydreams become more and more frequent cos thats the only way she can cope with them. The ending is really tragic and I couldnt help letting out a tear or two , it was just that painful to watch. I read that when this picture was awarded Best Picture at 2000 Cannes festival (Bjork got Best Actress) there were people who booed and jeered , cant really understand why !  I downloaded A Clockwork Orange yesterday gonna watch it later .....well nothing else to do also ......
How can a gal who once made me as happy as i can remember,  now can cause me such misery and pain? There was a time not too long ago when i couldnt wait to see or talk to her, i thought abt her all t
