i just remembered this and it made me laugh to myself---just like it did the first time... my mom retired this year.  she taught and was in the same school district that i went through school in so at the party i recognized a lot of the teachers.  this was strange for me as i was never that great in school and feared someone might recognize me and tell me some story about something i may have done in class...this didn't happen though.  the party was a big dinner and award ceremony.  the teachers were all to receive a little statuette for their years of service...anyway.  we(my mom, sister and myself) were seated at a table with very uptight people.  the whole night was stiff and uncomfortable.  i needed something to relieve the tension.  that's when desert came out.  the school's colors were orange and black so the restaurant had made individual cakes and frosted them alternately in, of course, orange and black.  i had an orange cake.  my mom and sister had black and so did half of the room of teachers.  we were one of the first tables served and we dug right in.  everyone was complimenting the cake and i looked up--the people with the black frosted cakes had black and blues mouths.  their teeth and lips--all of them were black and blue.  i see all these people all prim and proper with their black teeth and just burst out laughing.  i couldn't contain myself.  this dinner that was all serious and whatever--and everyone had these dyed lips/teeth.  i found it far too funny and had to hold the napkin in front of my face for the longest time so i caould get all the laughing out.  people keep lookin to the person next to them to check if their mouth was dyed.  it was really funny...
if you live in minnesota and you haven't been to franconia sculpture park yet--you really should go.  jesse and i met a bunch of friends there on saturday before we headed to st. croix falls.  it was the first time going there for most of them and all of us had just a blast. the best is this sculpture of two cars doggie style.  there is this music playing from one of the cars and everything is visible through the windshield... canoeing was great.  the best part is that you can get really lazy about it if you want.  the current takes you down the river, you really just have to steer to stay off the banks.  the st. croix has a lot of little islands and sand bars to pull off on.  we found a nice spot to stop and lit the grills and had one of the best bar-b-ques i have had.  everyone brought great food.  we played frisbee, drank, layed around...it was so relaxing.
