Sometimes life just gets so fast paced, that there's nothing else for it to do....it has to slow down.  I just realized, that's not always a bad thing.  It's going to happen....maybe se we can be even happier when something good comes up.  Instead of complaining, I should use this as an opportunity to do something nice, be a better person, a better friend, a better girlfriend.  So, this is my new... and more postitive outlook.  Hope you like.           ~KelC
I wish people could just mind their own business.Stop judging people on the crap you hear about them.   1. It may not be true 2. If it is, you dont' know the situation.   I've heard a lot of rumors lately about girls I consider pretty decent friends.  Then, you all look down on them, because you want to think you're better than that.  Well, get over it.  I'm sick of being asked "what I've done" with guys, I'm sick of hearing other girls get asked the same question.  I'm asking  you  a question : Why do you care?  Seriously, does it give you some kind of power to know?  Then, when we won't tell you, you say, ohhh, I won't tell. So, why the hell do you want to know?  The only reason is so that you can tell other people about it....sound like you've got all the info.  Why should I expect you to keep it to yourself if I can't?  It's just getting to the point where it's ridiculous... Leave me alone if you have nothing better to talk about

Wasn't as good as when I practiced it, but then again, nothing ever is, so I was pleased with it.  I can't wait to see who got what tomorrow ! If nothing else, this was a good experience. I tried out with Joann Durbin, Brian Conrad, Matt Carlen, China Davis , Brent Cope, and another girl I don't know from anywhere else.  Everyone was great....heh, made me look bad.  Well, I'll let you know how it all turns out, tomorrow.    Strangers will become Acquaintances  Acquaintances will become Friends Friends will become the People you Love I'm looking forward to every new Stranger
Went home sick from school today.  I feel horrible....my throat is all scratchy and sore, figures since it's the day before auditions...  I'm under the strict orders to speak as little as possible until tomorrow, after I sing.  I'm not seeing that actually happening, because I can't stand not being able to communicate.  So, I'm asking you all to learn sign language by tomorrow so you can talk with me and not screw up my voice. (ha....if only it were that simple)  I got a cheerleader comment today.  Stereotypes, people....stop it.  The funny thing is it was from a football player (hahaha) who is undoubtedly(let's try to say this nicely...) less mentally endowed than me.  Also, it was after I had figured out something for a
