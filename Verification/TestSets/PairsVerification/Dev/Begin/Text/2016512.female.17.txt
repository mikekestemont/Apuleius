Does this lack-of-school day count as a "Snow Day" or a "Fridgidly Cold Day" or "School Can't Get Heaters to Work but My Brother Still Has B-Ball Practice Day" or what?  Whatever, all that matters is that I'm not in fifth period right now.  And the crowd goes wild!  *mediocre applause*  I've knocked off whole two chapters of The Two Towers this morning.  I feel a sense of accomplishment washing over me... yes, I bathed this morning.  Since I'm still a tad ill, I've been decreed to lie around the house doing as little as possible, to regain my strength.  That's all well and good, but I kinda want to go shopping.  Not like shop-til-I-drop-or-similar, but just bee-bop over to Pamida to buy my Skating Sister a present for next week's competition and etc.    I'm really very funny, don'tchaknow.  I got out of bed today @ 7:30am when I could've slept til... now.  I took a nice little nap earlier this morning, though.  I had a very interesting 'dream,' although I think I was still awake... do you count that as a dream, then?  A lucid dream?  Anywho, I enjoyed it... then I snapped back into reality, kicked myself swiftly in the rear a few times and then kept reading my book.  The Real World and I don't get along too well.

I really can't wait to leave this town. I love my friends, even you guys, but I still am painfully awaiting the taste of a town that isn't tainted with beet plant fumes and mediocrity. God I can't wait to leave. I'm not going anywhere amazing yet, but one day... One day I'll be somewhere nice. Somewhere warm and sunny, with art museums and sculpture gardens and coffee houses. Thus will be the stuff of my life.  Now is blegh. Then is ooh. Ten points for the future.
Greetings from the land of Manda!  I'm feeling quite vivacious... or maybe that's the cough syrup, I don't know.    Are two journals and two blogs too much for a teen?  Tune in tonite on 20/20 with Baba Wawa to find out.  This is quick, this is short... but I guess you know how it works.    What good's a first impression? Manda
Me in a Nutshell:  You are the Victorian period...tight-laced and practical, you uphold the rigorous moral standards of your time. While you are fastidious on the outside, you do have a darker side of opium parlours, prostitution and secret liasons.     urlLink ******  What Time Period are You?  ******     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    I like Frenchy on the side.

So, in my on-going quest to find my true self, I was rummaging through the mail. Lo and behold, what did I find? Why, I found a lovely postcard, straight from the heart of Playboy. Jesus, I'm only seventeen. The last piece of my adulthood has finally locked into place with this three-by-five-inch glimpse of the world of magazine porn.  I am a man.
