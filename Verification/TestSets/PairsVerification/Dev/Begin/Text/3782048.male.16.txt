I think I understand what Cobain meant by the famous line in Aneurysm.  I told Charlie how weird I am. When ever she texts me or signs on to msn, or i see her, i get excited.Its sad. What's more scary is sometimes I feel pain when I see her. Theres nothign wrong with her, I love her. But I sometimes feel pain coz i love her so much.  Oh well.
Do I care.  I have more important things on my mind at the moment. I don't care if people think I fancy Charlie. People think war's wrong. People think it's right. People think the Audi's a better car then the Lotus, people don't.  It's all opinions to me.  And anyway, as long as I know it, and Charlie knows it, that's all that matters. Lana says I'm just as bad as those people who accuse me, for saying I don't care. I know I'm bad. I'm no good, but I don't really care what people think of me anymore.  There's nothing wrong with the idea of fancying Charlie. It's just people seem to have a big problem with me having a friend.  &nbsp;
This always happens. I have a bad day, and then I go and ruin it all by asking Charlie a really stupid question.   Today's topic was "do you trust me?"   Now she's angry at me I think, she won't text back, I only asked her because I feel like she doesn't trust me sometimes.   THere are times where I tell her anything, she tells me anything, and it's great. I've never felt so open (mentally) to anyone before.   But there are times, when she and Ellen/Andy will just abandon me to have a private talk. Pisses me off. I'm sure there are things between Andy and Charlie that no one else should know, of course. But when Andy and Ellen walk off or Charlie and Ellen walk off, I feel like no one trusts me.   It sucks. And charlie thinks I don't trust her. :(
I don't feel important. Simple as that.   So many things prove it. Small things. Like people not trying to find me on a train. Like not going after me to see if I'm ok&nbsp;when I'm pissed off. Like not asking me how I am. Like not askin me how I am as much as you ask other people. Like rarely being invited out places.   There's more.   &nbsp;  I feel like my head is going to explode if I don't talk to someone. It hurts.   &nbsp;  Things keep me going on. Somehow. I call these things, memories.   I remember, when we went to the cinema on Monday, to see Spiderman 2. Charlie and me were in Tescos, and she told me how she was going to jump on me and hug me, because we hadn't seen each other for a while. That would of been cool (the hug), but she was worried what Andy might think.   There isn't anything to think. Nothing's going on, nothing ever will. We're best friends.   She jumped on me later, a
