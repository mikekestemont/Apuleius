"i can't see them coming down my eyes/so i gotta make this song cry."--jay-z.      hello, it is me again (you expected someone else?). after a night getting home way too late from work and staying up way too late reading, um, "whatever you say i am: the life and times of eminem," i am awake. and the word of the day is   pensive.   for several reasons. the first being that i have had a long and one-sided dialogue with eminem and this book is making me...well, not rethink my stance about him; i think he's incredibly talented AND hateful AND mysogynist and no one, maybe not even himself, knows what is real and what is facade as far as his music goes.       hip-hop is both a reflection of society, ego, and id and a massive, fascinating game of fantasy on epic scales, said the white girl. i feel like both a bandwagonneer and a failed feminist--you know, when the marshall mathers ep was released the national organization for women  put out mad press releases decrying his stance, and called for boycotts and shit, but then he turns around and says "i'm just playing ladies, you know i love you." and jimmy carter-- jimmy carter!  came out and said that he likes eminem! so is he tired? is it safe for me to like him? i have no idea. i just do. it seems to me--and this is a great oversimplification--that he's saying things that are common threads in hip-hop and were in the first place, but becuse he is popular and because he is white, people hold him to a different standard and come to the conclusion that he shouldn't talk about what every other rapper talks about. but i mean, he says "threece." that's some funny shit.      i could go on about all the other rappers that i like too and try and save my cred and prove that the white girl likes black rappers--i could namedrop the digable planets, de la, tribe called quest, jay-z, atmosphere (oops, he's white too), public enemy--i could tell you about the looks that i got when purchasing "fear of a black planet" but i don't think need to prove myself. that is the problem with music fans--or at least the little insulated east-side-of-milwaukee-same-guy-with-glasses-at-every-show world that i both inhabit and study. i don't CARE about your cred, i don't CARE if you saw sonic youth in 1995 or were the first person on your block to buy nwa or have the rare french import that features catherine deneuve freestyling with rakim. it's beside the point. shut up and move ya ass.      on a whole different topic:      and for those of you who dislike confessional journal entries especially on the internet stop reading here:      the other reason for the pensiveness is that i found out through a late-night conversation with my sister that my father took a bottle of beer with him in the car several weeks ago. there is something about this forum that makes me feel safe in confessing this. like, he w
