haha most of you will be jealous, that's a given.  I purchased today "Inspiration" by William Hung! yay singing hits such as the awesomely sung "She Bangs", "I believe I can fly", "Hotel California", and "Y.M.C.A.".  It's awesome and I recommend you and your friends to go rush out and get this wonderful CD.  I got it for eight bucks, which is a deal!  Well anyways enough about Will Hung.  Fourth of July is coming up and everyone will be celebrating our wonderful country with blowing things up as always haha it's fun we all know it is (blowing things up).  I'll be doing what I done last year, boozing it up with my grandma.  I know how sad that sounds haha.  No, haha it's a lot of fun my grandparents come over and my grandma and I "take shots" (sips) of Smirnoff Ice so I won't be doing any DDing this year haha anyways hope you all have fun this Fourth of July!
Cal. State Fullerton of course!" you might of heard Cal. State Fullerton fans say as they saw their team win the final game of the three game series which was played this Saturday (CSF:  6, UT:  4) and Sunday (CSF:  3, UT: 2).  Jason Windsor, more than likely will be announced as the CWS Most Outstanding Player Award, did an excellent job for his CSF team getting two complete games and one save.  What lost it for Texas this year was their bullpen.  One of the best in the game, Texas' bullpen didn't pull threw, as former CWS Most Outstanding Player Award winner and A's prospect, Houston Street and the rest of his bullpen, simply didn't "git 'er done".  Street not new to the save chances with 12 saves leading the big 12, blew two saves in the CWS.  I had CSF winning it all after I watched them beat USC in the first round.  Go CSF!

Da Hogs lost to Arizona on Father's day 7-2, which wasn't as bad as our lose to texas, which was 13-2.

Well anyways I'm gonna have a final update on my sub-profile this shut that sucker down :'( all well I suppose I enjoy updating this website more than I do a silly sub-profile all the time, it will be better to come and look at this 10 years later than the sub-profile.  Nonetheless, to s
