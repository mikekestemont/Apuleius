the time we spend together its the happiest i've ever had but as with all things good something has to happen to make it all go bad  oppression and dictation will try to stop me seeing you but if every army in the land and every father with his own commands came together to stop us i'd blast them away without delay and run off with you into the blue of the sunlight fading away  rules were made to be broken
thoughts busy like flies buzzing round shit  this is not a happy day  this is not a happy day  i'm in the corner crying; in the dark demising  i have never felt this way  i have never felt this way  her mouth stiched up like a rag-doll's sore  i can feel myself decay  i can feel myself rot away   rocking in the corner of my mind's prison cell  proped up and leaning against my dark wall  i can't stop thinking these paranoid thoughts  and i wish sometimes that the roof would fall   to be smashed on the head  or beaten without end  would give me a break  from this angst-ridden life  and let my soul descend   problem after problem  i'm starting to ask; what's the point?  why bother trying if you just end up losing?  in everything i do, i only disapoint   i'm sitting here now  waiting for word from you  but what use is a one way word  to a mute beauty,  to whom happiness is long overdue

my god - it's getting worse. it's like i'm under a spell, or a curse. everytime i see her, my heart explodes in my chest. that's been happening for weeks; and my mind's a wasp's nest. but now she talks to me, and she sits with me and we laugh and we cuddle and w
