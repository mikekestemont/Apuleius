Hmm wiffle ball tomorrow. I think it's still going to be going on.  I had asked Mike if he would join us, he said he couldn't. I thought he was just making an excuse at first, his excuse seemed loose and fishy. I felt rejected and miffed, and didn't talk to him much after that. I felt like just being mad at someone, I think the summer as turned me into a non-caring person. Not like I'm going to see him at least until school, so I don't find it necessary to be polite sometimes. I even stopped talking to most people I used to entirely. I'm happy with my small group of friends.  Anyway, I sorta feel like a moron for acting that way towards Mike last night.  And I need to start eating normal. I haven't eating a normal meal in awhile.  I need someone to slap me on the wrists and get me to read my books, I have about 19 days now, and I know I'm not going to get it done well. I don't want to start with a bad grade in my English class. English is the only real class that I can honestly do my best in, and actually put effort forth for. I really shouldn't be lazy like this.   So I'm going to promise myself to get through five chapters this evening, and try to start thinking about the essay topics.

I'm not sure how I'm going to do reading the Crucible. I've never read through a play that is written like that before. I've done the whole shakespere bit, but it's entirely different from this. A lot of people say plays are fun to read though, so I'm trying not to get a bad impression of it before I even start reading it.  And that's about it.
Whoo hoo! Cheating on my livejournal. ( urlLink http://www.livejournal.com/users/somnambulauren )  It feels good. I'm starting to feel stalked and crampped on the ol' El-Jay. It's perfectly fine if I want to write something I don't mind others to see, but I like to have a little space on my own you know? I felt a little pushed around, influenced...Well maybe I was just feeling that way for awhile. I had cheated on lj before, with another lj account, then like a week later, took it down.&nbsp;   Weird. I might even like, abandon this in a week or month or so. Or I might keep it for a long time, I don't really know right now. I like to just let everything out and not care how long it's going to be, or who is going to read it, or what people are going to think.&nbsp; So, here it is. I hope I can figure out how to navigate it easily.  Oh well, I've had enough for now, I need to get t
