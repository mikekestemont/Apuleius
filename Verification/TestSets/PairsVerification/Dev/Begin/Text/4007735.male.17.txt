Not&nbsp;feeling too great at the moment. I'm not exactly sure why. Ever get that heavy feeling in your chest? As though something is pulling down on your heart, making it feel heavy as stone? It's weird how it just kinda hit me. I dunno, whatever. Tomoro I have to wake up early, goto the dentist, then go straight to work. It'll be a blah day to say the least but then again the past couple of days have been blah days I suppose so whatever. I'm just looking forward to this week to be over with already! This coming weekend and the next week should be much much better.&nbsp; And then the week&nbsp;after that I leave for Paris! So yea that's gunna be good.
