Unlike most folks I know, I read articles in papers from England, Scotland, Australia, just about anywhere. I enjoy them because they're not Republican; they're not Democrat. They're just journalism. Or something!   Do they have an agenda? Probably. But it's not an especially American political agenda, which is why they're so great. Like the 17-year cicadas swarming outside in my trees, they are pretty oblivious to American opinion on the war. They can "get away with" saying things that the major press here just can't. ("Freedom of the Press"? More like "American groupthink").     Articles from the international press that must have Michael Moore salivating:    urlLink The trail to Tehran . This British article seems pretty credible, despite its lack of "objective" tone. The connections between Chalabi and Iran and the concerns that Iran provided Chalabi with the inaccurate intelligence that brought the U.S. into the Iraq war are certainly worth following up on.   urlLink Who killed Nick Berg?  Okay, True Confessions time. I  love  conspiracy theories! It doesn't matter whether I believe them or not. And the Nick Berg case does have enough plot holes to wake up the inner conspiracy theorist in just about anyone who is not tied down by the notion that U.S. black ops. would never pull such a thing. At any rate, it's fun to see what the Aussies can print on the war. No major American paper would ever be allowed to print such a thing... true or not true.   Speaking of which... I read somewhere that one of the figures in the Nick Berg video was wearing a golden ring, and that such an adornment would be forbidden among radical Muslims. I'm not asking anybody to go out and watch the video, I'm just interested in the claim about the gold ring. Is it true that Muslims aren't supposed to wear gold or gold rings? Is that in the teachings of Muhammed?   Some articles from the  non-major  American press:    urlLink For Shame . This article certainly repudiates the notion (voiced by people like Rush Limbaugh) that all the "hand-wringing" over the torture scandal is inspired by liberals.    urlLink Gen. Zinni: 'It's Unpatriotic Not To Question' the Iraqi Fiasco . From my hometown paper, Falls Church News Press!!! I was attracted to this article because of the headline. (General Zinni formerly commanded U.S. troops in the Middle East... after Schwarzkopf and before Tommy Franks). Unfortunately, you don't get his comments till the latter part of the article. But still... You don't normally think of getting this type of reporting in a freebie local paper for a fairly small city. But Falls Church, Virginia is only 9 miles away from Washington DC, so politics and war policy are a part of our local intellectual playground.  Enjoy!
Okay, so I'm not just the Prophetess of Doom. Gotta say that there  is  hope for America. After all, we just voted Fantasia Barrino our American Idol!!! So it looks like we haven't  completely  lost our minds!  For weeks, I was wondering.   I'd see lesser talents move forward, as better s
