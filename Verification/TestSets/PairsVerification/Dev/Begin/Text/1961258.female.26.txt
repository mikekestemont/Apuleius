Still horribly fat. Done absolutely nothing about it .. more excuses why I didn't do it. I'm kinda like not caring anymore about how I look but then when I go out .. I feel so bad because I'm SOOOOOOOOOO FAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and everyone else is so tiny and beautiful .. and they have a guy or guys look at them. I look like a mom (a 30 - 40 year old mom who's had like 5 kids). I'm only 25 and look like this already .. what happens when I get there? Well I won't be a mom because no man will ever want me .. right .. who would want to sleep with something like this, case in point my ex boyfriend. So yeah I think there's no reason for me to lose weight. If I DO lose weight that would mean I'm changing who I am and i don't want to do that. What if I meet a guy and i'm all tiny and nice but then when my weight goes up, he'll dump me (because real love like in the movies does not exist). I am so sick of living like this. I am so sick of life.
My first entry into my weight loss journal. Woo hoo!  Anyway it's really early in the morning, and I guess I've been 3 or 4 days into my latest 'start'. I had a few mis-starts (okay, more than a few!). I usually restart everything when I do something 'bad' - like not exercise for more than a week, or eat way too much for a few days in a row. I guess that might be sabotaging my progress but I'd like a really clean start. I've been doing great for the past few days though.  So now I'm at 165lbs, again. I was 155lbs about 6 months ago but because of a few dozen things which went wrong from July 2003, I've started piling on the pounds. I won't explain what those are because it really is for a whole different blog. Ideally I'd like to get to 135lbs, but I've not been that weight since I was 15. I'd be happy with 145lbs which was where I was about 5 years ago. You can actually chart my weight like that. It goes up and down between the periods but every 5 years I put on 5 more pounds, not a good sign I'm sure.   So what's my plan? Basically it's like this ..   Meal plan  Breakfast - Special K with milk, some fruit Snack - fruit or Power Bar/granola bar Lunch - as usual Snack - same as above Dinner - protein shake or Special K ** Special - one 'bad' item (ice cream, choc, cookies)   Workouts      - 45 min treadmill (with 10min warmup/cooldown) .. 4 - 6x per week    - toning (arms, legs) - 3 - 4x per week  Not a very good plan I'm sure. The main problem I'm having is that my mom is a spectacular cook and she loves to cook so there's always a h
