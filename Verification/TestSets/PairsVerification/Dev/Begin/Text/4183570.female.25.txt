Okay, so the only really bad thing about Southern California is how much time you have to spend in your car.  I have been driving a minimum of two hours every day this week in my attempt to see everyone I've ever known in So Cal within the month of August.  Needless to say, I haven't gotten much work done. I did have this fun conversation about the concept of "deal-breakers."  You know, the things that mean you couldn't date someone.  The top thing, of course, was being a Republican, because obviously that is associated with all things evil and wrong in the world. My friend Amber says: "I would rather date a devil worshipper than a Republican."  Connie replies: "At least they have morals."  Ha ha ha ha.

I wish that expression could be applied to real life. Wouldn't it be awesome if you could be "stretched thinner?" I would be a waif!
I have to say that I did not intend to stay out all night last night. I made sure that I didn't drink so that I could go home early, and instead I end up talking politics ALL NIGHT LONG. Literally, I realized that I should go home because the sky was starting to brighten. Now, the reason that it lasted so long was that I kept trying to convince my friend Sparky that you can make a difference in the world. Essentially, at least, since all the topics that we covered basically would come down to that. It is my belief that while there are 280 million people in this country, if all 280 million of them say: "Fuck it, why vote? Why recycle? Why protest march?Why write letters to my congresspeople? It's not going to make a difference, so why bother?", then we are quickly going to be living in a p
