hello, its me again... well, i mean, of course its me... w/e  omg, this is KILLING ME! i'm still working on my 1 page of notes for bio. finals... one more unit to write down... and i still have yet to make my poster for history, and to memorize my speech...  which means that, i have to cram all my spanish stuff into my head TOMORROW... and then write my page of notes for geometry on wednesday nite...  holi crap... im not going to get ANY sleep this week... esp. b/c were going to las vegas after finals... and i mean, come on, las vegas is the city that never sleeps...  shyt, i mite as well stay up the whole nite... not good. i'll fall asleep trying to take my finals.   as you can see im in a right panic AND YET here i am writing this... why? because studying is boring. memorizing is boring. school is boring....  BOREDOM!    im so skrewed....
its monday peoples. bio. and history/english final's tomorrow. shit.   and instead of studying... i've been sitting in front of the TV. do you know how many times i've watched  the matrix  this weekend? i watched the frist 2 times, i watched the second 2 times, and i've watched the last one once... O.O"   now, tell me THATS pathetic.  mom and dad are coming back from las vegas today. b l a h . . . its much more fun to have the house to myself [of course, i couldnt be without my brother...] but moms surprisingly becoming more trusting... strange, but true...  lucky gina gets to be in las vegs all week because shes done with school... and so is davy... DAMN YOU PRIVATE SCHOOL KIDS! U SUCK! ^.^   haha, i think i'll go kick ryan awake now XD!  •patty•  p.s. going to LAS VEGAS after finals to hang out with my favorite cousin!   IN A REALLY BIG HOTEL!

yes, this week is deader than last because FINALS NEXT WEEK! AH! of all the times to procrastinate... BUT I CANT HELP MYSELF! if i tried to study, nothing would happen. so yesterday i watched  the matrix  instead... =P  lets see... saturday. woke up, tried to do work, and nothing happened, so i watched  the matrix  and afterwards i was all ready to work, and them mom says were going to my aunts house to celebrate my 'grandparents' who arent really, but we call me that... 40th wedding anaversery. so we got there, went to church, and then went back. it was supposed to be a surprise party and when we got there the first time no one had arrived, so we got back and who do you know but DAVY and RACHEL pull up right in f
