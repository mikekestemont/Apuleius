Oh my goodness!  I think I’m coming down with something.  Tonight, I will be sure to spend some quality time with my bottle of Robitussum.    Need to pack!  Can’t wait till tomorrow!
Yesterday, I was in a weird mood.  I hadn’t been feeling 100% due to lack of sleep perhaps from the night before.  I wanted to study, but my heart wasn’t in it.  After work, I picked up my car from the dealership.  I was dismayed to find my car in a moderately clean condition (instead of super duper spectacular).  Afterwards, I went over to Marcus’ apartment only to discover that he was absent.  I grabbed my badge and headed for home.  His absence annoyed me because he told me he’d be cooking me dinner.  When I got to my place, I gave him a ring.  He didn’t answer so I left a message.  He didn’t call me back till 7 or so citing that he’d been grocery shopping this whole time.  I talked to him about 3-4ish and he had given me the impression that he was wrapping things up and was heading to the grocery store where he planned to pick up some dinner and head on home.  That’s a long time to be wrapping things up/grocery shopping.    He didn’t like my tone of voice, and I told him the miscommunication was frustrating and that I was no pleased.  Tough.  After my failed attempt at a nap, I headed over to his place b/c he wasn’t answering his phone.  I figured I’d pick up the coffee he bought for me and maybe study till he got there.  Just before I arrived I called again, and he picked up.  He asked where I was and I told him I was headed to his apartment.  I asked him where he had been and he said he was talking to his neighbor.  He was surprised that I mentioned coming to his place when he wasn’t there.  I asked him if he had a problem with that because I already tried calling him to let him know.  He almost sounded accusatory at first, but he’s been over to my place many times without my presence.  He has no right to be angry.  I arrived, but noticed that he had no pot to boil hot water or a coffee mug from which to drink.    I wanted to leave almost as soon as I sat down.  It would take him forever to boil the hot water and I wasn’t in the mood to wait around for his tortoiselike pace.  I was thinking that I’d also wanted to sleep early and needed to wake up early.  He likes to stay up late.  I made as if to go and he asked me if I was leaving.  I said yes and asked him if he wanted me to stay.  He mumbled something that sounded like do whatever you want and my mind was made up.  I lay down and heard him washing the dishes.  He had mentioned that he could wash the pot and boil water f
