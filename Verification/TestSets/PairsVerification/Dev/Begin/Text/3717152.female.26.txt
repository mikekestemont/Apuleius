The caption of my blog is jinxing me.&nbsp; With all this work/travel crap going on, I have no time for  The Novel .&nbsp; But, I will take Notebook with me to the Shore this weekend, and hopefully be inspired enough by nature's glory to write.
I had an idea this morning.&nbsp; I was thinking something about the promotion of token minorities.&nbsp; Or maybe it was something about&nbsp;the&nbsp;following conversation that occurred during our last staff meeting:      Boss: &nbsp; Nothing much going on in the Office.&nbsp; The rules for telecommuting are being   finalized for the other Division, and since I haven't gotten any clear guidelines on these new     uniform rules, I'm going to be a lot more lenient on when you can work from home.&nbsp;         Colleague: &nbsp; Wait, what new rules are these?&nbsp;     Boss: &nbsp; Well, our Division has always had very liberal telecommuting rules, and now the     Front Office has instituted some new rules to bring uniformity across the Divisions.&nbsp;   Colleague: &nbsp; Those people have always complained about us.&nbsp; I can't believe we're going to     have to give up our benefits just because there are more of them and they hate us.&nbsp; Isn't it bad enough that they complain about us having offices?&nbsp; Now they have to bring our telecommuting rules into this?    Boss: &nbsp; We have offices because we're attorneys.&nbsp; And I never said that you had to give up anything.    Colleague: &nbsp; You're right I'm an attorney!&nbsp; If they want an office and more telecommuting privileges, then they should get off their lazy asses and go to school.&nbsp; I spent a lot of money on my law school education.&nbsp; I earned my office.&nbsp; If they want an office then they can do the same.&nbsp; Why should I have to jump more hoops because they're too stupid and lazy to stay in school.Guess who wins the pompous ass award. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;     There was a great article in the ABA Journal about this type of blue collar/white collar divide, and how attorneys from blue collar backgrounds are often more disadvantaged in the legal workplace than women and minorities.&nbsp; (The argument being that there are mechanisms and a certain level of awareness in place to counteract racial and gender discrimination, but nothing that highlights the obstacles attorneys face when raised in a blue collar family, but now find themselves operating in a more "cultured" white-collar world).&nbsp; Anyhow, this is illustrative of&nbsp;how a lot of people in my profession feel, and, I think, how a lot of "intellectual snobs" outside my profession feel.   Did I want to write about that?&nbsp; I just don't remember....
I jotted some notes down for  The Novel &nbsp;last night - just some random sketches on social structure and such.&nbsp; I'm toying with the idea of having two protagonists with parallel story lines, although that may prove prohibitively complicated for my feeble mind.&nbsp; I've also been intrigued by the Nick Carraway/second-person narrator, so I'll have to think about which makes more sense for my non-existent story.&nbsp; I do like the idea of revealing some of the sci-fi elements gradually, though (if f
