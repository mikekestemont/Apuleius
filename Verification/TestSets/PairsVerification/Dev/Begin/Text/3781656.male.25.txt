I've been thinking about the morality of mocking people. I think we do it because we have to appear better than the next guy in order to attract people like Connie Chung and David Schwimmer. And the easiest way to do that is not to work on actually being the best guy, but to bring down the next guy so that you seem like you're better.  It's easy to call the woman with a beard ugly, the man who gets airlifted out of his house on Geraldo because he weighs eight hundred pounds fat, and the teenager who does not know the alphabet stupid. But it's not so easy to volunteer to shave the woman's beard, or pilot the helicopter hauling the man out of the house, or go down to the local McDonalds to pick up an application for the illiterate. No one is perfect, and we should remember that the next time we are making fun of white males and others whom life has dealt a difficult hand.
The woman who runs my house would make a good mate for Dick Cheney. She is obsessive, conniving, and foams at the mouth.  I live in a group house. I'm never going to do it again, or at least, not unless I've flown my prospective housemates to Vienna to be examined by a random Austrian. Those people know how to sniff out weirdos, and when they do, they send them to America to touch boobies and become governors.  I'll tell you more about Dick's lover, and the Formosan male housemate who gets Victoria's Secret, a little later.
I work, as many do, at a large corporation that exploits Canadian labor to produce goods of shoddy quality with high price tags. My work requires an intellectual backbone but no legs. Indeed, the only physical labor I perform each day is to get into my chair, and had I an East German maid handy, I would not even need to do that myself.  Sometimes I look out my window at the road below, hoping that a deer, elk, or moose cross it and create some excitement. But the deer, elk, and moose were all killed years ago by the first Republicans, who came to our country in the late seventies to escape persecution by Dirk Nowitzki's mother, who was, and remains, awfully tall. So instead I work and ponder the great mysteries of life, many of which concern people's reluctance to use the word "phlegmatic" in casual discourse.
I hesitated before getting a blog. I don't like the sound of it. "Blog." Not much good rhymes with it. But more importantly, I know someone who writes a livejournal, and he's got some real problems. He likes to use his livejournal to tell folks what he buys at the supermarket. That's not that interesting. It's a little interesting, because he buys a lot of food, but really not all that interesting. I think you have to be a little arrogant to start one. Who cares about what you think, unless you are Macauley Culkin? Maybe it's j
