Now everything is back to normal.    Just like what they told me, form 6 is really different. We need to study by ourselves, teachers are there just to guide us, not command us to do homeworks or revisions. Everything is like a dream, I never expect I can be this far, I thought I will never grow up to achieve anything I dream. It takes 2 years to step in to the university. It takes extra efforts to make a goal, I told myself, I need to be patient, I must work hard and enjoy my form 6. Just call me  kiasu  or anything, I don't care, my goal is 'enter the U'. To those who always look down at and think I'm a loser, I don't care, you go your own way.   Teo get the JPA scholarship, he went to UTM on Tuesday. I will miss him very much! Lee  went to MMU few weeks ago, having fun with his university life earlier than anyone of us and meanwhile try to woo a cute girl in his class. I have no idea how to help him, just hope that this couple will live happily ever after ;)

I miss you,  urlLink Tomoko !   I miss you, Lee!  I miss you, my old school- ndc!
And, why am I complaining here? I fed up with my geocities homepage, because I keep on editing the wrong code, and I crack my brain for the background colors, I'm too much. I should let them in the same color.  Blur blur blur blue.
Now now now, I have my Gmail account, yeah! immature.serena@gmail.com with the 1000 MB inbox fainted
urlLink The 100 yen shop  is almost like our RM2 shop in Malaysia. But their shop looks bigger and far more interesting. They sell toys, food, drinks, towel, cartoon bowl and a lot more. If only I can go there, I will shop like a mad cat, because 100 yen is almost RM3.60, so that's cheap and we can hardly find any cheap thing in Japan.  urlLink Yani always drop by at the 100 yen shop with her kids  and her kids really enjoying their time there with those  kawaii  toys. Serena loves 100 yen shop! Wonder whether those RM2 shop will update themselves and sell things like that?
Don't know why, I have too many annoying people around me. I consider them as my friends, but how about them? It's ok if they absent in my life, I don't need these kinda people to ruin my life. Go away go away, I don't want a  polluted friendship .  My eyes hurt and I can't breathe because of the haze. Ah, this is terrible, I need fresh air, please!   I forgot to thank my friends for helping me last week in the MUET tuition class. I vomited at the class, and they helped me to clean the disgusting  stuff . Here's the list: thanks to Kah Boon, Li Min, Siew Peng, Lit Yee, Shue Ling and Nian Tze. You guys let me know that I
