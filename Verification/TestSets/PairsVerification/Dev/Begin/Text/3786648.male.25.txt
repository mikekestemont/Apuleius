I am honestly confused why this war in Iraq is so split down partisan lines.  Truly I believe this war could quite possibly set the record for completely conquering another country.  Wait that's not true...I'm pretty sure France surrendered in a matter of days.  At least Iraq TRIED to fight back.     I think to myself, WMDs or no WMDs, why was our actions wrong?  It seems to me the whole invasion of Iraq has fault tolerance on several political and moral levels.  No WMD?  Okay, overthrow him b/c he continued to threaten the U.S.  If his threats aren't valid, that's not our fault.  What we did was go into a country, overthrow a tyrant who was in violation of UN resolutions and give an entire nation something they've never had before:  Freedom.  There was a time in America when people were willing to fight and die to preserve freedom.      Now this is where I REALLY get confused.  Liberals are supposed to be people who consider themselves champions of human rights, civil rights, women's rights, equality, helping the poor, etc.  So...shouldn't the war in Iraq be EMBRACED by the liberal left?  Let's recap:  We just overthrew a totalitarian dictatorship- one of which who committed human rights violations, did not grant equal rights to women, used foreign aid money designated for food and medicine for the dictator's own personal interests.  I mean, Hussein broke every liberal rule in the book...yet liberals equate George Bush on Saddam's level or worse!    But the one liberal tactic that irks me the most is the fact that these hippies wave peace signs on the sides of the streets showing the numbers of Americans who have died overseas.  They want us to pull all our troops out so that there will be no more slaughter.  Michael Moore shows us a few pictures of people missing limbs and they cry out against such atrocity.  Oh the humanity, stop the insanity!  When did liberals become more emotional than progressive?  Yes, over a thousand Americans have died.  Yes, there were many more Iraqis who died.  But consider how many Iraqis would die if Hussein were left in power.  How many more would die under his son's rule?  Plus, when you put into perspective that an entire evil nation was overthrown at the cost of 1000+ Americans, that is truly a monumental accomplishment.  When you consider about 3000 men were killed at Fredricksburg in ONE day during the civil war, 1000+ lost over a year of occupation in a foreign land is impressive.  Folks, I'm not saying that it's good they died.  Quite contrary.  I value what our soldiers fought for and I honor them in death.  Their lives were a sacrifice- a sacrifice for a foreign people to have the opportunity to become that which we take for granted on a daily basis:  Freedom.  To say otherwise is a dishonor to the fallen.  To say what they are fighting for is not worth dieing for makes their entire mission pointless.  I love America.  And if there's one characteristic that defines A
