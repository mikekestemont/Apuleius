A quote made by Ronald Reagan from his "A Time for Choosing" speech made in 1964:  He said liberals refuse to acknowledge that the choice is not between "peace and war, only between fight and surrender." He added that liberals tell us "if we only avoid any direct confrontation with the enemy, he will forget his evil ways and learn to love us," (a la Jimmy Carter).  All who disagree with the peace crowd are "indicted as warmongers.  Let's set the record straight.  There is no argument over the choice between peace and war, but there is only one guaranteed way you can have peace - and you can have it in the next second -  surrender ."  This was made in reference to Soviet Russia, but I think it applies to our current state of affairs very well.
From drudgereport.com:  "The Kerry campaign calls on a publisher to 'withdraw book' written by group of veterans,  claiming  veterans are lying about Kerry's service in Vietnam and operating as a front organization for Bush. Kerry campaign has told Salon.com that the publisher of Unfit for Command is 'retailing a hoax'... 'No publisher should want to be selling books with proven falsehoods in them,' (what proven falsehoods?)"  This coming from the party of tolerance and diversity.  And from the party whose previous front running nominee, Howard Dean, claimed President Bush would  burn books , comparing him to a  Nazi/Hitler .
So this week Sen. John Kerry has begun to blast President Bush for his realignment of troops thoughout the world - a withdrawl of 70,000 troops from South Korea and Germany scheduled to occur over the next ten years.  He said that cutting our forces in Korea "is clearly the wrong signal to send" at this time.  Also, Kerry has made comments that the President is doing this as a political move to make up for the 100,000+ troops currently stationed in Iraq, yada, yada, yada...  I guess we've gotten to the point in the Presidential campaign where any action made by President Bush will be painted as a political move.  The only problem is that Bush has been talking of such a reduction in troop strength since he took office in 2001, as their placement in these areas is outdated - a cold war relic.  AND: Let's review Senator Kerry's comments made 19 days ago on ABC's  This Week :  "I will have a significant, enormous reduction in the level of troops. I think we can significantly change the deployment of troops [in Iraq], not just there but elsewhere in the world.   In the Korean peninsula   perhaps,   in Europe   perhaps. There are great possibilities open to us. But this administration has very little imagination."  (Sing along to the theme song of  Flipper ) "They call him Flipper, Flipper, faster than lightning, no-one you see, can flip faster then he"
So, I'm reading on the net tonight to read that the NY Times is running a page one lead: "the story of how swift boat veterans with a grievance were found by Republicans looking to t
