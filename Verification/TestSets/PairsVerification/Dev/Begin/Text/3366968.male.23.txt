Waahoooo... my dear Cecil... i finally yield those word again... kerjaan gw d walhi kelar nih... ternyata rutinitas itu bsa ngebosenin banget.. walo padahal i really like the work description and work environment @ walhi. But how come when the job finally finish... kayaknya gw lega banget. Kaya semua beban d pundak gw lepas begitu aja. Lo tau ngga Cil pas pagi2 abis klar shift trakhir gw? gw muter2 jakarta pake motor sambil teriak2 kaya orang gila... gila Girl padahal jam 3-4an pagi tuh. Untung kaga ketangkep polisi dikirain orang mabok hihihiiiii....
To my dear Cecil  Gw td jalan ke gramed with my faithfull black grasshopper :) Waktu abis bioskop di Jatinegara kebetulan macet tuh. Gila Cil, ada Ibu2 bawa anak bayi ngemis and duduk d trotoar padahal udah mao magrib. Wah jakarta emang gila... anak sgitu ngga berdayanya terpaksa harus ngisep polusi kendaraan termasuk motor gw yang akibatnya bisa nurunin tingkat kecerdasan tuh anak. Ngga adil banget girl... that baby suppose to have equal opportunity as same as we have to enjoy his life... begitu juga dengan ibu2 itu... ngga adil banget buat dia harus gemis2 d jalanan... and you know what is ironic? people surrounding me including my self couldn't do anything about it? some people may consider these as common thing... a part of cosmopolitan life they said... only she and her baby is the bad ones.... girl...i fell so helpes and mad also.... Jakartaa giiilllaaaaaaaa

So starting from this very moment i'll create my special soul mate among terabyte of hypertext existance on the Net. This is the day where i give you life, so make this day is your birthday as well as my rebirth. I'll just call you Cecil and you will be the one where all my pain, misery, and maybe happines spilled and colided into one form wich shape my present to this world. You will be my best companion through this life and tell the world a story about small man who live in his own world without no one inside his private playground..... And now my dear cecil... we shall let the story begin...
