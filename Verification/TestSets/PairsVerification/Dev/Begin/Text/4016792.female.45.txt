My friend Cathie came back from Aruba looking tan and gorgeous. Decided to go to the movies with Gina and Cara to see Fahrenheit 9/11. My second time. Oh, and it was her treat. Sweet.  The thing that blows my mind the most is the information about the Bush and bin Laden families' financial entanglements, culminating with their involvement with the Carlyle Group. I had heard of Carlyle, but knew very little about it. I googled it up when I got home and came up with   urlLink  this video   , originally broadcast on VPRO Netherlands TV. This stuff is enough to keep you up at night.  Anyway we agreed, I think, that you can only use so much money. Why do so many people put so much energy and extraodinary effort into making more than they could ever spend? I cannot imagine becoming so dehumanized that I could feel comfortable with the knowledge that I was exploiting or manipulating anyone, never mind everyone.

Should make tomorrow morning's commute excruciatingly embarrassing .
I spend the afternoon watching the Mets give away the game to Arizona. I love those guys, but they can frustrate the hell out of me. Then Susan and I decide to go to Ralph’s fishing station on the dock and have a beer. Or two.
Went to the movies with my daughter, Lisa. She’s a huge fan of M. Night Shyamalan, so we’ve been looking forward to seeing The Village. Stopped at Starbucks for coffee on this rare Saturday with her at home. She’s working toward her master’s while working 2 full time jobs, so usually she has classes on the weekends.

This happened a couple of weeks ago.  I go to Burger King for dinner. Hey, I'm not proud of it -- everyone has their dark side. I don't eat red meat, so I order the crappy chicken sandwich. I ask for a tender crisp sandwich with no mayonnaise and a d
