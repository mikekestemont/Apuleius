Today was boring for the first half.  Melinda is gone to kentucky for a whole stinkin week........i'm sad.  I already miss her and she just left this afternoon, its going to be a long week.  Today i went to band practice which went well when we finally got started, it was fun though.  Church was fun tonight, as usual, then after that we went out to go to the movies, guys night out, but then the little girls couldnt be home that late and couldnt watch a movie! How gay.  So we went to marble slab instead, it was goooood.
What a long boring day..........anything else need to be said?
Today was another great day, I almost didnt wake up in time to go to sunday school this morning, but i did.  This morning i went to church and afterwards i went to O'Charley's with Melinda and her mom, which is always great. When i came home i went straight to bed, it was probly about 1 and i slept till 5. Then i got ready and went to church, where Hanna-Grace gave me a picture she drew for me.........quite funny.  After church we went out to eat with the few of us that were there. It was melinda, me, joe, and amory and we went to graffiti's pizza. The food was good, but expensive and it was loud in there too. Isnt life grand!
Today was a lot of fun. First thing that happened was we got called at 9:00 in the morning to come to kellye's house to clean up her yard...........someone rolled it last night.  It was a big mess, whoever did it should be ashamed........or proud one.  While we were there Mrs.Watts fixed us a very nice big breakfast, then we headed out to go to J.w.'s house to ride four-wheelers. It was muddy and a ton of fun.  It was shaun, j.w., and me all there riding, it wasnt that muddy but enough to get a four-wheller really stuck.  Thats about all for now, today has been great, and it just keeps getting better!
Today was a very long exausting day. The first part of the day i was working vbs, with 4-year olds........its fun, but they can be a hand full.........well two hand fulls, but its all good.  After that i found out i had to work so i went to work, almost lost my finger though, whew it was close.  After that i got to go out to eat with my family, including my little cousin, she can be really fun! Then i came back home and went to an incredable bible study that the most awesome lady i know is teaching(i love you mrs.janis). Its about this max lucado book called "Its Not About Me"..........seems to be a really cool book.  Once again thanks everyone for putting up with me! i love you all
This weekend was absolutely amazing..........it all started wensday night with church, which was great.  Music was great and the word from Mr.Reed was right on.  Well then the really best part began that n
