After 13 or so posts I've run out of things to say. Truly sad.  Does anybody have any good music suggestions for me? I need new bands to listen to. I've been listening to a lot of the Autumn Defense, the Zombies and Wilco (no surprise there). But I know I'll get tired of it soon.   As I said before, the music stores I've been to recently have nothing in the way of interesting music. I did see a couple of Ed Harcourt CDs but I've never really heard anything from him. I wonder if I should take the risk?   Downloading is a bit difficult for me as well because I don't use a P2P program because Kazaa messed up our last computer and I have a phobia now of installing anything suspect so I just end up searching for "legal" downloads.   There's a lot of free music out there but it's really hit-or-miss.  urlLink Largehearted Boy  has an extensive list of music links everyday, and I've randomly downloaded some of his suggestions. The one that I've enjoyed the most is this band called  urlLink The Mountain Goats . They're an intelligent band that tell good stories. I suppose they're like Death Cab but not so sad. The other one I've downloaded was "Milking" by  urlLink Deerhoof , who seems to be the band  du jour  of the moment. I can't say I liked it. They're like a Japanese garage band, noisy guitars and distortion and a cute girl singer. I enjoy the occasional noise and fuzz but I just found her voice annoying. Not my cup of tea. But I've only heard one that one song so I could be totally wrong about them.  If you're interested in hearing either the Mountain Goats or Deerhoof you can download some tracks from the links below.   urlLink The Mountain Goats    urlLink Deerhoof
urlLink CNN  calls "A Ghost is Born" the most eagerly awaited  weird  CD of 2004.    Wilco's music is, by turns, enigmatic, compelling, thrilling and absorbing. And it's often -- let's be honest here -- just plain weird.  urlLink    Good band, bad hair   Ahh, when are they going to start selling it here?! Music One and Tower are completely worthless. Worthless!!! Their selection of music is a joke. I hate you Music One and Tower Records! You don't deserve to be called music stores!  Okay, my one minute rant is over. Let's go back to the love.  From  urlLink IMDB :   Pop hunk Justin Timberlake has come to the rescue of troubled ex-love Britney Spears' career - by offering to write songs for her. The Cry Me A River singer, who is now dating Hollywood star Cameron Diaz, has offered to help Britney's flagging career after watching her suffer the heartbreak of having to cancel her tour.   As some people may know, my love for Justin is unfathomable, but I don't think resuscitating a career that should have ended in the last century is a good idea. Dating Cameron Diaz isn't so great either. Maybe he should just go help the m
