Hmmmmmmmmm,             Was really busy in my office today. Waisay, sometimes i think that Allah Taa laah nain kiyoon attraction rakhii girls boys main. Waisay, one thing is for sure interest between boys and girls is natural but to control oneself is the test.  Khair, Allah Taa Laah test main kamyaab rehnain kii taufiq farwaa aiiy. Falling in love is natural but i have observed that love between people who fall in love after marriage last long. Cuz, that love accepts all the right and wrong angles of a person and both accept eachother with it. Waisay, i agree that many of the times girls have to compromise as men have made their rules like they are written on a rock. But you know what i have observed that intelligent khawateen know how to tackle their husband. One should have understanding of other's behaviour. Cuz, nothing is gonna change his love for her all he says is in flow of some problems or emotions and when the water setlles he realize what he has been saying and everything becomes crystal clear for him.This whole process requires eachother's attention and people who get engage marriaged has curiousity that what is the nature of other person and have a life time to understand eachother. Waisay, hamaray religion main loving somebody is not seen as a bad thing but what i have understood is that it says if you like someone you send your message in her family and if they allow you get married. That is how i have heard all the marriages of Saahabaah.  SO, as far i have understood our religion says whatever you do, do it till its completion means, the extreme of loving someone is to agree to live with him or her till end of life time. Our religion doesn't appreciate the views now-a-days people have keh nazroon hii nazroon main they can even tell the size. Aray bhai, agar yeh piyaar hay tou i must ask keh what is lust then? So, i believe in it as well keh whomeever i would love i would make her my wife. Waisay, i said when this event arrives the attitude i have i m not sure keh koi bhii ladki would like to continue the relationship with me. Cuz, i don't allow people to try to figure out what i am I think only people close to me has this right( by people i mean girls ;) ).  Whenever any girl smiles at me or shows some guesture even if she is not thinking like that i instruct myself keh bach bachay bach. Cuz, i know girls are really sensitive about theses matters and the relationship that starts from simple plain talk usually ends up in keh she will even take you to resturant as well if you tackle her right. Hey don't take the word tackle in wrong way. So, the more any girl try to come near to me the more i get the irritation. I would love to love someone who is just mine not like s
