Before I continue, who is TonyBlair??? If u wanna use an anonymous, atleast let me know by email lar… so I can answer ur question personally mar… hehehehe….  Just kidding by the way…. (but who is TonyBlair… I m serious n dun tell me is England PM):)  Day 8 – always wake up quite early, bcos wanna go Sunday market mar… the market not selling fish or meat… it is place for public to sell their unwanted belongings, so basically most of the goods sold there are second hand (although there have new goods also). The goods sold there are very cheap. Hav fren bought a Nike jacket for just £1… soooo cheap leh…. Okie.. then I bought a glass, also not sure whether is crystal or just grass… but quite nice, so dun really care lor…. Then after lunch, hav a discussion for group discussion for wed… sad leh, Sunday bust still need 2 do assignment… last time, by this time, I should b playing badminton 1 mar… hahahahaha… long long time didn’t hav sport liao leh….  Day 9 – 2day have done another unusual thing tat I seldom or hardly do in my 4 yrs in TAR, tat is went 2 learning centre (same as library in Malaysia) to borrow SOME books…. The worst thing is I hav to carry all the books from the learning centre back all the way back to my room…. :p  But in the evening, we hav a quite delicious dinner.. hehehe, we hav our 2 best chef, Su Tsheng n Cher Ching prepare the dinner… hahaha.. . this thu cham liao lar, my turn… some1 help… hehehe…..  Day 10 – today is tue… so dun hav class… but need 2 wake up early, need to go to the laundry… if not go later, there will b many people…. Later hav discussion again… but satisfy with the outcome as manage to finish the preparation for the presentation… so now can start to concentrate on other assignment… hehehe….
Wat my feeling toward Sheffield??? Cold, cool and a bit of disappointment.   Cold – although now is summer, but the weather was quite cold especially the 1st day. It was a gloomy day and rain late of the day. The temperature was below 10 degree Celsius. Then the other days was like the weather in Genting Highlands and sometime even cooler then Genting… but I quite like the weather here, u can walk for hours with out any sweat in the afternoon. Believe it or not….  Cool – the cars, building, scenery and bla blab la were cool. After a few days here, I can see all my dream cars, Ferrari, Lambogini, Lotus, GTO, FTO, Impreza, BMW (the model tat drove by James Bond) and many many more tat I dunno the name. however, there is proton here also. Oh ya, kancil also got. Taken photo somemore… hahaha : p  oh.. bout the building, most of the building may seem a bit old, but inside the building was very nice and class leh…. E.g. Sheffield Hallam Uni… :
