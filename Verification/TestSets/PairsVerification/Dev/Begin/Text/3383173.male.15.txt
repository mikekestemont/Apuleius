God damn these worthless humanoid scum! They feel as if they own everything, as if they're perfect. They think like they're God himself! And they even gang up on Sakura... Getting little Ryuzuki here mad as hell, and I don't want to see what happens to those guys if ever Ryuzuki meets them... Bloody... It's going to be too bloody for my tastes... Poor guys... Hope you had a happy life messing up someone else's! Cause your puny pathetic excuse for a life is going down the drain I like to call Ryuzuki's anger... Sure, he can take his anger and shut it in a very big room, leaving him sane for about two years... Well, he's been keeping his anger in for over five years now, and he's telling me he's going to let it all out, but this time, not on some unfortunate piece of wood, but on a lucky guinea pig who likes to mess with his sister's "peaceful" life. So, good luck, whoever you are, you lucky bastard... You get to feel Ryuzuki's cold-blooded anger first hand... I envy you, really, I do... But I don't think I will after I see the results...  Sakura, don't stop Ryuzuki on this one, Sese, don't even think about helping Ryuzuki on this one, and as for Taka, Tyr, and Lady Oria, please do as he says, and keep out of it.  You'd best look at the fire (blood) works... And hope you have enough detergent to scrub off the blood that's going to fly your way...   -Kazeshi (As named by Ryuzuki)
Ahh… I’m back. How did you guys like Ryuzuki? He’s been pretty persistent with his apologies. Cowardly wimp! My dear Sese, don’t misunderstand what I said. I did not and will not target special Nepher. I merely tried to tell her that she’s the only one who can prevent Ryuzuki from snapping and bringing my destructive fury into life. I didn’t mean for her to get hurt, however and whenever it may have happened. I’m sorry if you thought I’d hurt her. I am the angel of death, I admit countless men and women have died at my hands, but I am always accompanied by justice. I do not strike down those who are innocent, no matter how mad I am at them. I guess that just got stronger with Ryuzuki’s feelings towards Sakura. As for Tyr, Ryuzuki asked a little favor from him which I approved of, if ever I get out of control. Tyr will do all that it takes to stop me, because right now I know of only three entities besides Ryuzuki who can control me: you, Tyr, and Oria. I’m actually happy that Ryuzuki was open enough to share his body with me.  By the way, Sese, why did you forget about me? (Well, I never gave you my name before, so that might have been my fault.) I never knew you’d take Sese as your name in this lifetime.   It’s ironic that the twins get us as their reincarnated guardians. Honestly, I l
