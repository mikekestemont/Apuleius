.m o v i n g_i n. 07.06.04- 07.09.04     After a quick 30 minute drive, we saw our apartment for the first time. Friends had toured the apartment before we signed the lease, but there was still an element of surprise and adventure as we laid eyes on our new dwelling! Needless to say, our arrival was much anticipated. We met the apartment manager, Bonnie, who showed us to our apartment so we could let the cats out and put down our (overweight) luggage. The cats were quite surprised to find themselves in California!    Before we could officially move it, we headed to the apartment manager's office to take care of some final paperwork. To our surprise, Bonnie asked us for our deposit and first month's rent. Rick had mailed a cashier's check two weeks prior, so we were caught off guard when she said she hadn't received it. "Well, I can't let you move in without that money, and we don't take personal checks," Bonnie noted with a forced smile. I was sort of waiting for Cuba Gooding Jr. to appear shouting, "Show me the money!!" It was quite a reality check. This woman was not going to bend the rules for anything, and wasn't amenable to any of the alternative solutions we offered. For all of her sweet words and smiles, she is a tough cookie! I couldn't believe that after all of the planning and anticipation, everything could fall through at the last minute. Thankfully, after a few tense moments she finally agreed to let us put the deposit on a credit card. To this day, we don't know where the check is! (Rick is going through the long process of putting a stop payment on the cashiers check.)                Now that we had maneuvered our way into the apartment, the next step was to move all of our belongings. Our moving truck was scheduled to arrive on Thursday, 7/8, so we rented a dolly and enlisted the help of Rick's brother Gene. (In the meantime we had an Aerobed, but it had a small hole so I had to reinflate halfway through the night! It was quite amusing to wake up in a deflated bed.)     When moving day arrived I called the movers to triple-confirm the appointment. Everything had already been set up and confirmed, but I hadn't heard anything from them for awhile so I began to get suspicious. Sure enough, when I talked to them they informed me that they weren't coming. Our stuff was on a train somewhere, and they could not give me an ETA.    "Maybe Monday.  Would Monday be ok?"  they asked.    "Absolutely not! I start work on Monday. There would be nobody here to accept the delivery." At this point I was exasperated. Moving really wears out your patience!   "That's ok, we can just leave everything on the sidewalk in front of the apartment." was her reply.    It's moments like these that I'm thankful I'm friends with so many New Yorkers. Some of their NYC attitude rubbed off on me, and t
