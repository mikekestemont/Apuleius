Okay....so I've realized that I just miss Andrew like crazy!     I miss seeing him, talking to him, being around him...     I just get to thinking about him working so much and it sucks, no doubt about that!  And he does need to concentrate on his work, but concentrating on me once in a while isn't too hard...so I think at least!  A simple email would have done! I just realized, that when I was talking to a co-worker last night, I realize how much I miss him...how much I just want to see him...how well he treats me...how much he does love  me...     I guess a week of nothing can make a girl question. And i know I shouldn't question, but just the fact that this is how my last relationship ended, it scares me, really scares me!     I just wrote him an email of how i feel about him and what he means to me!  Maybe I'm an idiot for doing that...but I can't help how I feel about him!  He is everything to me!     Some of you who know what is going on and maybe have read my past posts are gonna shoot me in the head, but I can't help how I feel....     Anyway, I'm off for the night...I will write more tomorrow!     night y'all!
So its Saturday and I am finally calling this my first day off this week because I ended up working a midnight last night!  The things I do for friends!!  Or, I'm just insane!!  either or it doesn't matter...I had to work last night!  So today I got up at like 2pm and I promised my mom and the rest of my family that I would scrape the paint off in the bathroom and clean it well because the tiling guy is coming within the week!  So while I did that, my mom ripped off the wallpaper in our front foyer, and my brother finished insulating the basement!!  Our house looks like a tornado hit it 5 times over...its a hell hole!  But I just keep thinking how good its going to look when everything is done!!  I can't wait to see it!!  But now I'm sitting here covered in paint chips waiting to hit the shower cuz I stink!!  LOL!          I was invited out tonight to go to the Junction, but I don't know if I'm up to it...I'm exhausted and I'm thinking I may just chill out here tonight and read some of my book!  Maybe I will go catch a movie with my mom....i dunno...but I'm definately staying home tonight!  I'm gonna go to bed on time tonight too and get myself back into a night sleeper routine instead of the day sleeper that I am now!  Midnights screw with you man...i don't recommend them at all!          Haven't had a response from Andrew concerning my email yet...but the wedding in Illinois is today, so I really don't expect him to write me back or call me till he gets back...so we'll see!  I will be sure to keep you all u
