OMG...I just dont think that I can hold it in any longer. Its just that I have all these feelings running around at once and I just dont think that I can take it without being able to just let it all go on someone and considering the fact that I dont have anyone to do that to...then Im just gonna let it out on everyone! I cant take being in this house anymore, its like no matter what I do here I get yelled at for it, I cant take the fact that me and my friends are not anywhere near close to being how we used to be. I cant take the fact that I cant see the people I love when I would like to see them or need to see them. I cant stand having to look for a job all summer, cause thats not how your supposed to spend your summer. I hate the fact all of my summer plans were ruined. I hate it that I have no money to pay for my car and no job to help me with that. I hate that when I do what Im told or asked I still dont get anything out of it for me.

I want to be able to graduate and not worry that to many things will change. Like losing more of my friends and all of us forgetting each other, or me not being with my boyfriend anymore like we talked about how we would be. Or worrying about where im gonna get the money to go to college. I dont wanna have to worry about any of this stuff anymore.

I didnt know that I was gonna have to be making all this important choices all at once and the worst part is I dont have my good influence there to help me make these choices anymore. I have to do it all myself, while helping someone else make there choices for them. Its just way to much to do and its to hard. I just wanna be able to drop it for a week...all of it...and not have a single care in the world except what im gonna eat next or what im gonna wear. Just one week...
Well theres not to much to do today cause its raining. So today I just decided to sit at home and clean for the most part of the day...I cant help the fact that im a neat freak. Then I went up to Royal Pizza after Danie called me and told me to go up there cause they were hiring...so I d
