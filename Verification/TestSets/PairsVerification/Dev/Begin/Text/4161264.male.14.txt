This totally sucks.  My dad wakes me up at about 5:30 on work days.  Its thursday, I work thursdays.  Today I woke up at 7:30 because of the screaming sister.  So...I went back to sleep after my dad woke me up, and my mom isnt allowed to give me a ride to work.  So i'm stranded here.  Last night, went to the movies and hung out near dennys (resteraunt) with some friends that i've seen like, twice.  They beg me to go to the movies with them, but, also say how i'm an asshole, which they dont really think so most the time.  So, I just wont hang out with them anymore.  Got home at 11 last night.  Tomorrow, friday, 8am, my grandparents are going to roll down here and pick my sister and I up.  Saturday my dad and Mom go to block island on the boat for their aniversery, maybe friday they leave.  I dont know.  My dad thinks the whole family is all goin to block on friday with him on the boat, so, we're giving my parents a lil solo time at block for their aniversary.  I'll be at my grandparents house, no computer (so I wont be on aim), Friday night, Saturday night.  Then, I'll be at Block Island sunday night, and coming home monday.    Is it just me or does this weekend sound like a mess.  ugh, well, I'll have my cell on, so, idk.  hmmmmm MAYBE i could bike to work today... nah, If i showed up on the bike everyone would give me shit.  It'd be 9-10 by than.  Slow day anyway I'm sure.    So, I have my cell, the day is still stupid and young, so maybe I'll post here again.  Lataz.
WHAT A GREAT ASS DAY!  I woke up like, 11, went on the big boat, took the dinghy, hung out at knot island till about 5, goin back and forth from the boat to the beach, hangin out, takin pics.
