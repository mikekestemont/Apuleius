I like the snow. This blizzard is kind of a blessing for me. Walking in, and marveling at the snow this evening, my mind, probably staying with the theme "good things", started to move to St. Petersburg, Russia where this summer I had the experience of venerating the relics of  urlLink St. Xenia of Petersburg ...the fool for Christ.    urlLink This isn't my picture , in fact...it's much better than the one I took there. I began by walking through an almost empty graveyard, with just a few old women praying by the grave sides of departed husbands, mothers and fathers. After a short walk I came upon  the chapel that houses St. Xenia's coffin and holy relics. This Friday morning there were a couple of women outside of the chapel lighting candles and praying to St. Xenia. I walked around the side of the tiny chapel to find the door... upon walking in I was surprised to find the place packed with people. As I walked in and got on line to venerate the relics, a priest and what appeared to be part of the choir from his parish came into the chapel.  Almost immediately the choir went to a little "choir loft" and the priest began a panakhida . Suddenly the chapel was filled with prayers for the reposed and the choir beautifully and loudly chanting "Gospodi Pomilui!"(Lord, have mercy!) Really a tremendous experience...to witness all of this devotion. After finally leaving the chapel I made my way out of the cemetery, this time going a different route. At the cemetery's exit I came to a couple of old women begging for some money. After giving them a few rubles they gratefully crossed themselves and prayed for me... I couldn't help but think of St. Xenia's days spent wandering and praying around that very spot.
Welcome to my blog.  Just what is it that I, living a life of near absolute boredom and depravity, have to offer the viewing public? Not much. Enjoy!
Today marks the two year anniversary of my mother's miraculous healing after emergency surgery to remove a brain tumor. At that time, her doctors believed she would live about one year. After surgery, radiation, and clinical trials to treat her tumor (Glioblastoma Multiforme-worst tumor there is) and through Christ and the prayers of St. Nektarios and St. John of San Francisco, there are no signs of this tumor left.  She still suffers greatly from the affects of her medication, and the cancer could reappear at any time...but for now we are thankful to God for what we have!   O Lord my Savior and my Master, I, Thine unprofitable servant, with fear and trembling give thanks unto Thy loving goodness for all Thy benefits which Thou hast poured so abundantly upon me, Thy servant. I fall down in adoration before Thee and offer Thee, O God, my praises. With fervor I cry to Thee: O God, deliver me henceforth from all adversities and mercifully fulfill in me such of my desires as may be expedient for me. Hear m
