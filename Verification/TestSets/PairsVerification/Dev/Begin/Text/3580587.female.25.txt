Made lentil soup for dinner tonight.  Damn, that is good.  And so simple.  And so cheap.  About 8 ounces of lentils, water, a diced onion, a few sliced carrots, and a diced green bell pepper.  Plenty of salt & pepper.  One pot warms ya.  I keep pulling up other windows on my computer.  I can hardly pay attention enough to write tonight.  Guess there's nothing too exciting to write.  There's an art project going on in Austin.  Check out the website, (http://www.cracksinthepavement.com), but basically, it is sort of a scavenger hunt for art around the Austin area.  I went yesterday during my lunch break and right after work.  Only thing I managed to find was tall grass with unidentified bugs that bit my feet.  And I got my dress pretty dirty.  Hey, I went right after work.  Thank goodness I always carry a spare pair of flip-flops.  But, then again, who knows....maybe those high heels would have given me an advantage in the tall grass.  Anyhow, I really hope I find some piece of art in all of this.  I am just worried folks are going to beat me to it.  Beat me to them.  Whatever.  Thank goodness it is Thursday.  This week has gone by quickly, but without much sleep.  Here's to the weekend.  Think I'm going to Houston & Lake Charles.  For Father's Day & Paw-Paw's 88th birthday.  That man is in great shape.  I'm so impressed.  I'm sure my dad will live the same way....healthy as a bean up until at least his 118th birthday.

Folks really need to take more accountability for their own actions, and not depend upon other people to tell them what to do.  So, make it available, and let folks decide if it's something they want to risk or not.  Their decision.
I had a program scheduled for this afternoon, in which I was supposed to have 40 kiddos (4-11 year olds).  Big, unpleasant surprise.  I got to the site early, so I decided to spend a few minutes sitting in my truck, listening to music.  Only, it wasn't music I heard.  My ears were overwhelmed with the shouts and screams coming from inside the building.  Yes, inside the building.  At this point, I laid my chair back and closed my eyes for about two minutes.  Tried to think of the reasons that I was here.  Why I wanted to be here.  That I was paid to be here.  Even my purest unselfish thoughts were interrupted with the echoes of the fighting, hollering, and caterwauling going on only yards away.  Finally, I shut my eyes hard one last time.  Then opened them, grabbed my s
