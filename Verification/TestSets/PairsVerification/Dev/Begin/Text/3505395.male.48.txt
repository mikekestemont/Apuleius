The following are  stories I've written for a weekly column in our Sunday bulletin at  NewStart.         &nbsp;     When I was five I cheerfully stood by and  watched my three-year-old sister get a spanking for something I did. My mother  thought my sister did it, and I didn&#8217;t bother correcting her. A five-year-old&#8217;s  sins aren&#8217;t as impressive as an adult&#8217;s, but they are just as contrary to love.  When I was six I told Jesus I was sorry and asked him to help me be good.  Suddenly I felt so clean and free. The sky literally looked bluer and the grass  greener than I&#8217;d ever noticed before. I felt lighter than air. When I was 12 I  realized that even though I wanted to love like God loved, my heart was still  different from his and we struggled a lot. I then surrendered absolutely and  completely to his love and he filled and changed my heart in a way that carried  me through all the turmoil of adolescence. I found a joy and a peace that were  &#8211;&#8211; and are &#8211;&#8211; indescribable. I have had worries and struggles and hard times  since then. I have failed and messed up since then. But God hasn&#8217;t. That was  over 40 years ago, and his love for me seems sweeter than ever. Every time I  discover another old hurt or a new fear, he takes it and heals it or conquers it  and drives it out with his love. I highly recommend complete surrender to the  love of God.           &nbsp;       For years Michael Payne struggled with severe clinical  depression, failed marriages and rejection by churches. &nbsp;  Then NewStart sent out a couple of  mailers the week before Easter of 1999. &nbsp;   Michael received one of them, and cried when he read the challenge to  hope again. &nbsp;  He recognized in our  dream the cry of his own heart. &nbsp;  I&#8217;m  so glad he did. &nbsp;  At NewStart he  experienced the overwhelming love of God for him. &nbsp;  He began to find healing from the  depression, new joy and purpose and a renewed capacity to give and receive  love.         &nbsp;         God has given Michael the gift of  encouragement. &nbsp;  He can consistently  be counted on to contact and affirm our NewStart family members who are  struggling, stressed, sick or just absent from our fellowship. &nbsp;  He continually expresses to us the love  that God has placed in his heart. &nbsp;   He has become a dear friend and brother. &nbsp;  Surely some of God&#8217;s greatest moments  must include Michael Payne.          &nbsp;       When we talk about &#8220;God&#8217;s Greatest Moments&#8221; it&#8217;s easy to  focus on the dramatic crisis encounter, or the people with the showy gifts or  loud personalities. &nbsp;  It&#8217;s easy to  miss the real backbone of an organization, who stands in the shadows and quietly  keeps it all functioning. &nbsp;  Darrell  Bohannan is our church treasurer, with all the headaches and responsibilities  that entails.         &nbsp;       Three months after the Hearns arrived in the     United States    we still didn&#8217;t have a core group committed to starting a n
