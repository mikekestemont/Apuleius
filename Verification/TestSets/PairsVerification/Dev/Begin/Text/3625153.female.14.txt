~~>josh and i have been talking about us. its been so different since our fight last week.. =\  it makes me really sad because it seemed like everything between us was so perfect before..  ~~>but to tell you the truth, which i dont really wanna do because i dont wanna hurt anyones feelings here, but im trying to be completely honest here, i dont really know too much about josh. we talk and all but.. its hard to explain. our relationship is so different from any others ive had..  ~~>which, may be a good thing, i really care for him so i cant really say too much i guess.. i really love him a lot and really wish i could be closer to him so we could take care of each other.. i think maybe we could have a much better relationship offline than online. which kinda sounds dumb if you read it, you might say "of course its better offline, you get to know a person better" or something like that, but i have relationships with people that are much better over the net than they are off it. and these are people that i know from school and such.  ~~>moving on.. it seems i cant feel anything anymore. i dont know whats wrong with me. its like i dont care about anyone but myself because i cant feel much for others, but i know i really do care for them. sometimes i feel like everything in my life is so fake because of that. example.. ok, a little over a week ago josh told me that he had just found out he might have a kid with another girl. i got really upset at him, or at least i appeared to be upset with him.. i really wasnt upset at all. i mean, it surprised me, and i dont want him being attached to a girl he doesnt care for as more than a friend, but i wasnt upset or angry. i just acted that way mostly because i thought that was how i was supposed to act.  ~~>sucky thing is, i cant tell josh any of this. i know hes gonna read this anyway, which i really kinda want; not that i want to hurt him but i do want him to know. i dont know.. maybe its better if he didnt.. but anyway. i dont want him to think i dont care for him or about anything hes going through because i really do. i just.. its not how its supposed to be..  ~~>i guess ill go now.. i have more to say, about other things, but i dont feel like talking anymore right now. everything in here seems so depressing =(  be happy.. i love you joshua, and always will no matter what we have to go through. dont ever forget that. i never want to lose you..
~~>im so scared right now.. ive been laying in my room thinking about stuff. i had a really bad dream last night about the end of the world. i
