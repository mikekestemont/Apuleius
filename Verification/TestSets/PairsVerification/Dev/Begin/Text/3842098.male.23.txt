I was doing some reading online during my free time at work and came across some stuff about christian dating. I would like to find out what people think about something so I am putting a question at the end of this post. Please provide your input (this will be a good guage to test who actually reads this, if anyone). This question is just something of curiosity on my part (nothing more, nothing less please don't read into it anymore. I've thought about it before in the past and wanted to know what others think). Here's the question:  Do you think there is only one person for everyone out there that they are supposed to end up with? or are there many that could fit?
