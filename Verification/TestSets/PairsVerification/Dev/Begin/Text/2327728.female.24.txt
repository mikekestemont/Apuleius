I am in a rut right now. I haven't done any real work for a week, and my supervisor is back from a trip tomorrow.  I was *supposed* to be spending the week writing an article (or at least roughing it in), but I didn't.  At all.  Things came up.  And the subject matter is less than exciting... I just don't want to write it.  The thing is, I should have told him before he left, since it is now 3 weeks overdue to the publishers, and we are in trouble.  We will now have to write a 6000 word article in a week.  It takes me that long to write out all the references.  Yikes!  I am super-pissed at J today.  We had plans yesterday, and I was snubbed several times over.  It was raining, so our plans to go walk dogs at the SPCA fell through.  He called at 10:30am to tell me it was a no-go.  Understandable - who wants to walk dogs in the rain?  I suggested that I go over, and make some chinese food, to which J was amenable, but first he needed to do some things.  Call back in a few hours, he said.  Okidoki.  3 hours later, I am bored out of my tree, and I want to get out of my very small, very empty house.  So I call.  J hasn't done anything yet because a friend called.  He has now decided to take a nap.  Fine... when are we getting together? J: "I don't know.  I want to nap.  And maybe go for a run." M: "how long with that take?" J: "mmmm, I dunno." M: "You sound non-commital about the whole thing.  Do you want to spend the day by yourself?" J: "I didn't say that.  You know me, I hate being alone.  I just have some stuff to do." M: "Fine.  Go do your stuff." J: "I will call you later, and then you can come over, ok?" M: "OK, fine.  Call me later." J: "I will."  And then I don't hear from him.  I could have made other plans, but no, I am waiting for J.  Who never called.  It was so fucking rude, I want to smack him right now.  I know that I am not J's girlfriend, but I want to get all girlfriend on his ass.  I want to yell at him, and tell him that he can't treat me this way.  If a girl-friend of mine ditched me in the same way, I couldn't lose it on her, but a guy-girl friendship is different, and I feel that I do have some of those girlfriend privileges i.e. letting J know when I am really mad.  Which I am.  Fucker.
I heard something that I feel is fucking profound. Truly inspired.  It was a study that was reported last month in the Journal of Neuroscience (very prestigious journal in the field, for those of you who don't know) about brain activity during the male sexual orgasm.  I am still looking for the article, but basically, t
