I'm blogging this right now as I sit in one of the libraries of the university that I work at now.  There is a man sitting next to me, probably a grad student, who smells like sweaty feet and who quietly grunts and moans and rocks back and forth in his chair as he types his email.   Sigh.  I started this blog on Tuesday and on Wednesday invited a good friend, Becky, to join.  We're not quite sure what we're doing and where we're going with this yet--it might in time turn into a web magazine or/and on-line resource for poets, or it might, as so many grass roots literary projects do, die within a month's time.    Whatever happens, it's always important to try stuff like this.  Marginalized fields such as poetry need many people making many attempts to make our fields matter.    I'm new to blogging, but I like the excitement of it, of watching a creative project like this find its form and grow...Maybe in time pick up readers.  Maybe not.  Maybe continue quietly forever in an unread Zen-like state.   Or maybe there will be people who will in time find it and begin to think more about the field.  And maybe they'll start looking for the stuff, and maybe they'll start reading it, and maybe a poem here or there will help them, in small ways, change their own lives.  The man next to me, humming now, is tucking his knees into his tee-shirt and continuing to rock. He's excited too.  ****** FIRST FIG -Edna St. Vincent Millet  My candle burns at both ends; It will not last the night; But ah, my foes, and oh, my friendsâ€” It gives a lovely light.
Okay, I'm a swing voter, (and I know I probably shouldn't admit to that in these politically polarized times, oy....) but even though I haven't totally made up my mind on who I'm going to vote for this year I think it's rather cool that John Kerry's campaign slogan, "Let America Be America Again," is taken from a Langston Hughes poem.    Next month a volume of Hughes poems called *Let America Be America Again* will be published to tie in with Kerry's campaign. It will contain eight other Hughes poems besides the title one.  Kerry (or Kerry's ghost-writer...) will write the preface.  Whether or not this was an appropriate poem for Kerry to choose for his campaign is debateable.     According to Timothy Noah of *Slate*:    "Let America be America again" comes from a poem published in 1938 by the Harlem renaissance poet Langston Hughes. But Hughes intended the line ironically. A black man living in the pre-civil rights era would have had to be insane to look back to a golden age of freedom and equality in America, and Hughes was not insane. Hughes was, rather, an enthusiastic cheerleader for the Soviet Union at the time he wrote Let America Be America Again, which explains the poem's agitprop tone. 'I am the young man, full of strength and hope,' Hughes writes in the poem:  "'Tangled i
