-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- "Hagrid! Hagrid!" yells Ron pounding at the door of Hagrid's hut.  The noise of Fang barking and heavy footsteps makes Ron stop pounding on the door.  "Fang move aside. It's bloody three in da morning, this better be good." Hagrid bellows, as he opens the door and swings it wide to see a smiling Ron looking at him.  "Ron what's wrong? Harry in trouble? He's not in the forest is he?"  "No Hagrid, none of that. I'm sorry I had to wake you but I need a huge favor," begs Ron in an almost pleading voice.  "What favor? At three in da morning, come in here and tell me what's going on." Hagrid said, ordering Ron to come in and pointing at the table and chair for Ron to sit in.    Ron explains the whole conversation he had with Professor Dumbledore, minus the Hermione part, to Hagrid over tea and his rock cakes. Oddly enough, Ron ate the rock cakes as he figured it would be the only thing he could keep down in his stomach. They were just too heavy to throw up.  "I still don't see why this couldn't wait for da morning Ron. Are you telling me everything?" asks Hagrid suspecting Ron's strange behavior.  "Hermione is seeing...Malfoy, and I want to leave before I see her in the morning."  "Hermione seeing Draco, - CODSWALLOP! Where you hear such a lie?"  "Listen Hagrid, I really don't want to re-live it. You can ask her yourself. So can I have the recommendation, please Hagrid?"  "Sure Ron, but you are making a mistake about Hermione."   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ron raced back to the Gryffindor tower to pack. After an hour and a half of silently packing in the dark, Ron had everything he needed and everyone was still asleep, even Harry.  Ron set down at his study desk; he figured he owned Ginny an explanation.  Dear Ginny,    I don't have much time so I will be brief. At times like this, you find out who your real friends are and just how important family is. Unfortunately, yesterday I learned the hard way.    I am leaving Hogwarts for the next 3 months to take a Co-op job with Charlie in Romania. I am not sure if I will be any good handling dragons, but I definitely will be glad to be away from this place. Please keep Pig for me while I'm gone, because I seriously doubt if he can fly and deliver on such a long international route. Better to use International Postal Owls instead. I promise while I am gone to write once a week to you.    I love you Ginny and I am sorry I will not be around during Christmas; it just really hurts and I need some time and space.  -Ron  PS. Keep this info to yourself, I do not want anyone else knowing where I am. That especially means a certain Head Girl.  PSS. Don't tell Harry, the back stabbing git, either!  PSSS. Keep an e
