The abuse of Iraqi prisoners in Iraq is disgusting, abhorant and near vomit inducing. American and British soldiers, albeit a minority of them have behaved terribly and individually they should be punished, but at the very top heads must role for these despicable war crimes.  The Red Cross has reported severe concerns of breeches in POW conditions as stated under the Geneva convention, and yes all ye idiots, America has signed up to the Geneva convention. In the British segment Red Cross advice was acted upon, the fact that the abuse ever took place is appaling by itself, but in the American segments abuse continued.  The Arab world will use this again against the west and in particular America, a major figure must go to show that these acts of abuse are simply not tolerated, for the good of all of us. RUMSFIELD MUST RESIGN.
Exam stress, a stubborn attitude and a slight arrogance on my part have made the last week difficult to say the least. I have been, in the words of one of my 'friends' (you'll see why I use inverted commas later) a jumped up backstabbing dick. I think this email, sent to me after a pathetic dispute over... well the email explains all:   Dear Richard   You may be correct, it may be us that owe you an apology, and i am sure that we were all prepared to talk about this like sensible adults. However, you may think that you are being mature by sending around an email telling us that we are pathetic, but for once could you maybe take a step back from your seemingly bottomless pit of knowledge, and the attitude that you always know best, and think to yourself "Maybe i am the pathetic one?"   For example how did this whole situation spawn, well i can tell you quite easily, it began when we very kindly invited you to come on our holiday with us in the forthcoming summer, what a nice gesture. Obviously not. Somehow you managed to fabricate the idea in your own mind that we didn't want you there, which we obviously didn't considering that we invited you! You then went on to moan about the cost, location, and company which would also rather piss you off somewhat if anyone else had gone about acting in the same 'pathetic' manner. When asked if you would be attending the trip by myself and Richard you went on to kick a chair, slam a door and then go and tell Adam and Simon that they wern't invited. Very mature. I feel that what you did to them was the biggest backstabbing action which you could have taken, very noble considering that you were supposedly good friends with all of the people on the trip. As you can tell this pissed all of us off just that little bit more, but still i was prepared to hear your side of the story so i came and found you in your history room where YOU found it interesting to bombard Amy and myself w
