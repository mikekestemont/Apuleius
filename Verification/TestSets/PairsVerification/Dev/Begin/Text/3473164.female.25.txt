So, I got a little serious yesterday, and part of me wants to apologize-- probably the same part of me that is scared sometimes-- but I am not going to apologize.  Apologies, fear, and lack of faith in the individual are to be avoided.  Well, not all apologies, but... apologies for being serious and committed and a visionary.  You shouldn't apologize for that.  So there.  Just  urlLink breathe .    Today is my last day selling  urlLink MINI Coopers  for a baseball legend.  I never thought I would sell cars, and I never thought I would work for Hank Aaron, but now I have done both.  Life has a funny way.    Selling cars has taught me a good bit, including how to drive a manual, which makes me feel more competent as a human.  I have been driving a MINI, and now I have to give it back, which makes me sad.  My  urlLink real car  doesn't have airbags or a CD player and only the left-side speakers work, so I will be unsafe and without good tunes.  Here are some heroine hints to buying a new car: 1.  Say no to dealer prep fees, bank fees, and generally any other fee that is not included on the Munroney Label, the official label from the manufacturer that by law must be displayed in new cars.  These fees can be negotiated.  Now, most dealers do have a documentation fee, and here at MINI we never waive it, but there might be some negotiation at other dealerships. 2.  There is generally flexibility in the finance rate that an auto dealer offers you, so even negotiate your interest rate if possible.  Car dealerships want your finance business and will generally do what they can to gain your finance business.   3.  Be sure to thoroughly inspect your car when it is delivered.  Look for dings, scratches, etc.  This is not to say that they will be hidden from you, but sometimes even a dealership will overlook something, and it is better to take care of it before you leave.   4.  Do your internet research.   urlLink Edmunds  is a good place to start.   5.  Look at several dealerships.  Comparison shopping works well in the car business.   6.  Be nice.  Remember that car sales people are people too with families to feed, or in my case a cat, and for the most part they are just trying to earn their keep.  Most work on 100% commission.  7.  Buy a  urlLink MINI  or  urlLink Scion XB .  Maybe that will be of some help to someone, even though I don't think anyone is really reading my blog.  Which leads me to ponder how does one force people to read their blog?  Okay, well maybe forcing isn't really the right verb, encourage, how does one encourage.    I am feeling a bit nervous about being unemployed.  I will officially be part of that faceless 5.6%, but I will go voluntarily.  I was supposed to talk about Israel today, but I am busy trying to figure out how I am going t
