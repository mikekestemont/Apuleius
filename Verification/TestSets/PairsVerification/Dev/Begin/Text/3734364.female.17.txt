Wow...  Haven't bothered with this for a few days...  Not to much to say though, I guess...  I have slept almost the entire weekend. Just been uncontrollably tired. I got up around 11 on Saturday whent to see my brother then came home and fell asleep again. And that is what I have been like for the past few days.  My poor friend. His heart is broken and I can't help. I can say sorry and offer comfort, but I have been in his place and I know that it is all useless. I know that none of my words will heal the hole that he feels right now. I wish so badly that I could help, that I could change what happend for him. He is such a nice guy and he deserves so much. I don't know what to do... Except pray for him. Which I will continue to do because God must have some sort of plan for him.  Ugh... I was fired from my babysitting job. They said i didn't take her to the park and swimming enough. But it has been to cold for that stuff. ahhh. and I couldn't take her bike riding because I have a heart problem and that could kill me. O well. I'll start looking for a job again.  This weekend. This weekend! It is so close and I get to be with my love.  I just need to make it through my psych appointment tomorrow and everything will be fine.  lalalalala....  I have more to write, but I also have to do some other stuff so TTFN.... TAH TAH FOR NOW.

Next Saturday.  I totally can not wait for next saturday.  I had to go shopping today for clothes that actually fit me and... umm.... yeah. I bought thess two cute outfits. Well I didn't by them my mother bought them, but yeah okay back to the cute outfits. One is specially saved for next saturday for when my fiance comes to town. And then one is for tomorrow night.  Tomorrow night will be interesting. I have a dinner thing with my mother and older sister. Lol. We never get along and the three of us are going to dinner. This ought to be very interesting. It took us forever to decide where to go because I am a vegan vegitarian and so places where I can eat are very limited. We are going for Chinese though so yummy yum yum yum.  Geez I have been so depressed I just slept the evening away, and had to force myself to get up so I could get my shower and t
