Lately I've been asking God to take me to another level in my worship. And He's doing just that. I have begun to really just seek true intimacy with the Lord.  I've also just asked Him to move me out of my comfort zone. And yes He has completely. In 2 weeks I have a music recital in which I must play the piano and sing. I can do the piano part, but I'm a little nervous about singing. I have never sang in front of anyone before. So yeah I'll be completely freaking out on the day of the recital. But that's where my faith comes in. I'm singing "How Deep the Father's Love for Us", and it's lyrics are so meaningful and powerful. I really think God is putting me to the test with this recital, because there are some big hurtals that I have to jump over. But if I put my faith in Him, then He'll just pick me up and carry me over them.  After the recital is over I have to sing in front of my church. OK time to faint. :) But I have to learn to do it, because I'm a Worship Leader in the making. Father give me strength.   How Deep the Father's Love for Us  Stuart Townend  How deep the Father's love for us, How vast beyond all measure. That He should give His only son, And make a wretch His treasure.  How great the pain of searing loss, The Father turns His face away. As wounds which mar the Chosen One, Bring many sons to glory.  Behold the Man upon the cross, My sin upon His shoulders Ashamed I hear my mocking voice, Call out among the scoffers.  It was my sin that held Him there Until it was accomplished. His dying breath has brought me life I know that it is finished.  I will not boast in anything No gifts, no power, no wisdom. But I will boast in Jesus Christ, His death and resurrection.  Why should I gain from His reward? I cannot give an answer. But this I know with all my heart, His wounds have paid my ransom.
Ok first maybe you need to know a little about me before I begin posting. I'm 15-years-old, and I have 2 days of 9th grade left (that's counting today)! OH whew I'm excited!  Anyway God has already given me my calling, and that is to be worship leader. Now if you knew me personally you would probably be as sceptical as I was when I first received my calling. I'm not shy, but I'm not that outgoing ... and well let's just say that I don't fit the profile of someone being in front of the church every Sunday and Wednesday leading a choir. But God told me to do it so I will be obedient to Him.  So right now I'm learning all I can about singing and music period. I've been playing piano for about 4 years, so I know a good bit about music. In f
