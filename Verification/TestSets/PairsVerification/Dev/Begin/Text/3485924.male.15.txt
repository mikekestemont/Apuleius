Short answer: no.  Long answer: not really... but let me expand ^^  Today was a day like any other.  Well, that's a HUGE lie, but it was sorta like any other.  I'm still in New Jersey with my family staying at my dad's cousin's house.  It's not too bad, but like I said, it felt like a really long day today.  I woke up around I'm guessing 6:00.  I just kept drifting in and out of sleep because of the two year old downstairs making a huge rucus (whee! fun word that I have no idea how to spell).  I slept on that inflatable bed for another two hours only suffering from mild nightmares and crap...  Okay, so I finally got my lazy butt up and got ready because we were gonna go eat at McDonald's.  Let me just say, McDonald's = the most fake food you could ever eat.  It was jam-packed too.  I just totally hated eating there and hope that I'll never haver to eat anything from there again (big hope... but, I won't throw away food given to me, even if it's from there).  We went back to the house, and there me and my sis watched Finding Nemo on this very laptop from which I'm posting.  I had seen the movie before, but it was still pretty good the second run ^_^.  After the movie, we went to pick up my dad's cousin's daughter (typing this over and over is getting annoying...).  We came back and we took a walk around the "neighborhood".  It's not too bad, but there's still a lot of construction going on.  It felt weird to be so close to summer and have it be 60-some degrees up here (I had brought shorts and t-shirts >.  Blah, blah, we went to watch Shrek 2 after that and that was a good movie.  So, overall, while it was a day only a little longer than my usual, it still felt VERY long.  Well, it's late and I'm tired, so I'm gonna go to bed.  Bye all! ^^
Hi all, and welcome to my crazy world of Gerbilness (in other words I'm just bored and want something else to do while on the internet).  Lalalala, ok, so right now I'm in New Jersey.  Contrary to popular belief, I actually don't live here.  Yes, I live in good ol Ashburn, VA.  After a not too tasty 6 hour drive, we finally arrived here (we being me and my family).  For the first time ever I'm not dying of boredom after 10 minutes here.  They have wireless internet, and we were able to set up my sis's computer here ^_^.  This means that I'll actually get to enjoy being in New Jersey for the first time in years.  I got to talk to my friends a little earlier when I was on.  That was fun.  It turns out that they betrayed poor old me and went running without me ;_;.  I'm not too sad, because as long as I get to listen about what happened, I'm h
