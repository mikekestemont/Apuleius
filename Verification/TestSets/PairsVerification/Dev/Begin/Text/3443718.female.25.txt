Hey UH-GNAW-KNEE-MOOS  .... can I shorten your name to UGKM?  If you post by signing A? How will we know who the real UGKM is?  Any Anonymous bloak could come pretend to be you even though you aren't really any identity... you could quickly get a really bad identity....  so if its agreeable to you, perhaps those posting and reading right now can come to know you as UGKM. (Of course I guess that means now you have an identity?) What a condundrum. Glad your here.  In fact, I think I'll change my identity while I'm at it.  From now on I'd like to be just "B".  Anyone want to be "C"?  TTFN - B.

Has anyone else seen   Man on Fire  ? I saw it on a Sunday afternoon--a time when my emotions are typically raw. Everything about the movie was cliche except . . . why was this burned out, alcoholic, ex-CIA able to quote Scripture and why did he read the Bible? Who put that in the script? Why?  Something got stirred in me and I felt sad, like I was watching my own life through a window. A moment came when God said to me, "Pay attention to this!" I knew that the next couple of lines were going to be really important, so I listened carefully. One of the odd characters in the movie spoke a sentence that was God's message to me. I was bowled over, and so thankful that God would let me be there, alert me to the fact that something was coming, then hit my heart with a message He had been working in me for several weeks.  Want to know what it was?
For those who live in the world and desire to embrace true virtue, it is necessary to unite together in holy, sacred friendship.  -St. Francis de Sales
