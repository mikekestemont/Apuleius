Yes.. the Title about is absoutely true ...everywhere... now and then... we have to plan on  where to go.. and wil the time affected..  well.. you have to be physically fit.. coz there is a lot of running here and there..have to catch up wif the bus.. or rather.. know which bus to take to our destination... have to complete the quiz after the reaching our destination... and we have to think fast .. do fast and oso act fast... it is generally about your speed of your thinking.. your running.. your walking... this is really important for tht.. I think that i m the most useless one in my group coz i dont even noe which bus to take or where is ended to.. luckily ..i have a capable teacher and student from other school beside me.. Thank god!. We actually are at even timing wif the 1 of the group.. but when both of the group reach the destination.. the quiz was "  Perform a indian dance OR sing a malay song".. i was thinking which song to sing.. but... a girl from the other group seemed to be quick-witted... and oso ..erm.. how should i sae... is tht she is not shy about anyting.. she juz sang the malay song.. and off they goes... den we .. were like dilly dally all day.. asking one another to sing.. well ... it waste a lot of our time though... after... a boy juz sang.. and we passed.. and we waste time on deciding whether we should take a bus to the final point or run there... so we waited at the bus stop.. deciding.. this.. of course .. waste a lot of our precious time.. the dealine is getting nearer and near.... 10 minutes away... we decided to run... we ran like wild cavemens... and were like encouraging one another that we musn't give up...  time passed fast ... soon it is oni 3 minutes left... Do YOU think that we can  make it...  we were like hurry up... but it seems so fast.... Yes .. we reach it... BUt... our verifying card were not wif us.. Oh GOsh!... the other team whcih is at the back of us.. were chasing up and the verifying cards have finally came to our hands... but unfortunaly .. they catch up.. and they were in the 4th place.. whereas.. WE were in the 5th place.. but... we have sucessfully completed our station... Some groups which are in the top place of us.. did not complete their station.. so ... we did not give up hope... the results came....... ANd... we are in The 3RD place.. hurray.....  Nice one...  it is really a amazing race....
Oh&nbsp; god, i think i have suffered from the greatest blow of my life.I don't suffer in physical way... but in inner - self of me. Lots of tests come together continously... LOts... i really want to take a rest...this is really too much for me... i cant take it anymore.. The school gives tests like no body '
