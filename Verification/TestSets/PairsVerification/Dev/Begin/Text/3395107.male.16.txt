Went to CCM again. This time when I sang the worship songs I felt joy and happiness and praised Jesus from the depths of my heart.The sermon is about Joseph again in Genesis 37.Chemmy then prayed with me and others for two Aunts I do not wish to reveal at the moment.Then went to BlueSky to have dinner.That's all. Tomorrow have to go and do more research for HOI essay.
Today is another ordinary mundane day. Woke up at 9 but fell asleep until about 9.55. Then I forced myself to wake up again. I changed and uttered a short prayer. Then I went to Evan Burge Building but I discovered that the HOI tutor Rex was seeing people one by one to comment on their HOI essays. I was a bit fuming. I should have slept until 10.45! Anyway I was quite ashamed of my essay. Slipshod at best. I promised myself to go and do more research on Saturday. Today for physics we plunged into momentum and impulse. Quite unexciting. Then for Maths 2 tutorial I asked Dr Felicity for assistance on the topic of ellipses and hyperbolae. Quite interesting topics. My sketches and work done on these conic sections would resemble a manuscript from the Principia Mathematica by Newton. That's all. Tomorrow had to go for Christian fellowship again. I can't wait!
This is ridiculous! It is already 1.50 a.m. in Melbourne and I'm still online! Haha! Yesterday went to Physics Lab to do experiment with Kiran. On Oscilloscope.Quite boring. Tried out with AC and DC current. Woke up quite late and had to do research for HOI essay and rush to the lab. Unimpressive and I think the experiment was a big flop. :X  At IH dinner ate potatoes and lamb. Not quite appetising. Also had a dialogue with Aunt Teresa and Zhan Hui online. The weather is quite cold yesterday.My headache persisted again. Uncle Peter was quite concerned. That's all for today.Goodbye! :P
Yesterday the Internet access was cut off. I desperately posted a message to the IHouse people.Today the access was restored. Praise the Lord! Yesterday I had much write about; went to two churches at once-SSCoC and CCM and partook in the communion TWICE.Quite a lot of singing, dancing and praising and worshipping and glorifying the Lord Jesus Christ.I was quite exhausted. I was quite happy to be among my people-united together as the Body of Christ.At CCM we also had to listen to a personal testimony, and it was quite shocking and emotional to see people crying as to how Christ has intervened in their lives. I also remembered that for the past 17 years I had suffered and endured all the ridiculous nonsense but finally God stepped in and pulled me out of this loneliness. Thank you Jesus, for redeeming me out of every tribe, tongue and nation with the blood You shed on the cross! No wonder His Word keep on ringing in my ears-"These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will h
