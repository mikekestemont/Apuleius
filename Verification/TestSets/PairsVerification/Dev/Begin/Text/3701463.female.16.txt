9 more days til I'm finally 16! Yea! Not... I'm not having a party or anything. Of course that is my choice, but who would I invite? There is Jayla, Duane, Phillip, Robert, and Ricardo, but that's about it, and Duane has to work so he couldn't come.... OH well. I'm getting sick of my life. I finally got rid of my dad and I guess I expected my mom to be nice ot me.  She bitches all the time because she says I don't do enough around the house... Well, I think I do a lot considering that I am her daughter and I have nearly raised my brother... It's nice to feel appreciated.And now she won't even let me tay home on the weekends becasue she doesn't trust me. Don't get me wrong I love Gramma and Grampa to death, but I hate being over there every weekend and then being there every day during the week to go swimming... I've been thinking a lot since Kent State Competition about Model U.N. That was my second comp. and I pushed my self really hard for it. I worked so hard researching and everything and then BOOM! It's over and Val and I had NADA! I blame her.... She always contrdicted me in everything we said, She went so far off policy it wasn't even funny, and yet everyone is blaming me.. I think I want to quit. I love debating and I actually do think some of our topics are pretty cool, and I wish I could be a good delegate, but I don't think I can ever do that now. I knew me and Sanchez didn't have a chance walking in to Jefferson. There was no doubt of that one in my mind, And when he meowed in council it only solidified my fears... I'm getting that awful feeling that I came into the downfall of what had once been such a great organization... Mr. White did say it was a "rebuilding year" but i feel like I let everyone down... I think if me and Val could have pulled a Superior jor even an excellent we would have won Kent... OH well. And then there is this whole "duane thing" I love him soo much and I don't want him to leave this fall... I wish I could keep him here with me, becasue I know that I am going to need him more than ever this coming year. I wanna try out for Volleyball and I'm hoping I'll make the team... Even if it's not varsity I just want something to do, If not then I'm going to play soccer. I don't care... I don't know about M.U.N. though, Iwant to quit but I have all these people saying give it another chance... So I think I will give it one more year... If I lose all of those competitions then I will quit and tell myself I tried. Band is getting boring. I use to love playing the flute. Everyone use to tell me I
