Thats part one. And since that episode was after midnight this all counts as ne horrifying day.   But it does get better.   Woke up.  Very  unstable. I wanted to kick out at the walls. I didn't care whether I broke my toe or not. Resisting the urge I understood but can't control, I got ready for school. (I have to say first- I don't want to kill myself. I don't want to kill  myself.  I don't want to kill myself.  And its not one of those things that if you believe it enough its true. Vraiment.) First thing I fucked up: getting myself late for school. When I came in I only had 45 minutes to prepare myself for English lit exam. Clever(!) Second thing I fucked up. This is big. I forgot my mice of men book. This is the equivalent of forgetting your calculator at a maths calculator exam...you had no idea how on the brink I was. I felt like everyting was just clamping down on me and I was dissolving into liquid...no wonder I was crying so much....I went to the teacher and she told me off about how stupid I was so I just went downstairs, found a private toilet before I collapsed with tiredness and just sobbed, sad songs pumping through me (Goo Goo Dolls?

What a day. I'm too tired to analyse..however I will say this. I am ADDICTED TO HARRY POTTER SLASH. Especially gay Harry Potter/Draco Malfoy hybrids. The good ones are brilliant. The best ones are truly something to remember. Here's a link. Its called irresistible poison-you'll love it! urlLink http://www.schnoogle.com/authorLinks/Rhysenn/Irresistible_Poison/more2.html  Aurevoir Friends!!! Night everybody. I'll try to stay a little hopeful. Maybe, not even cut myself. Whatever. Bye...
Today I had the closest scrape than to what you could possibly get to a public nervous breakdown. I had a terrible night last night. It was so hard to not cut myself last night. I have the idea that when I'm fine for a while, and the precise moment I think of cutting, or the fact that I'm doing so well, I end up cutting on the same night. Or the night after(tonight). So I, was in my battle with the scissor god(my nail scissors-weapon of choice), and I began to touch it again-v. dangerous. Then, I began to run the point along the veins of my left arm-easel of choice. And then, that thought, the horrible thought crossed my mind. I could feel t
