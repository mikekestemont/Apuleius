Hey everyone!    Well, surprisingly enough tomorrow I will be making my first trip on the Shinkansen (bullet train).  After talking to my parents and Dana as they explored Tokyo, I decided that I really should meet them in Kyoto!  A) I haven't been yet.  B) I somehow managed to gain some nenkyu (paid vacation days) and C) my family came all the way to Japan and as things previously stood I would only get to spend 4 days with them.  Luckily I was at my favorite school where the teachers are absolutely amazing and helped me to sort out all of the possible ways I could get back and forth to Kyoto (trains, buses...).    Armed with a little bit of information, I ventured in to Sendai to try my luck at a travel agent.  With my trusty electronic dictionary I entered the travel agent relatively prepared for the task at hand.  For 30 minutes the agent and I discussed possible routes via buses, trains, and even planes.  Writing down times and dates and using lots of gestures and my broken Japanese, I finally left with train tickets in hand.  Granted I paid a lot of money, but sometimes the satisfaction you get from having successfully accomplished something completely in Japanese makes the dent in the wallet not quite as painful.      So in less than 24 hours I will be seeing my family for the first time in 7 months.  If you can`t make it home, it is always nice for a little bit of home to come to you!  The next 25 days or so are going to be crazy...4 in Kyoto, family in Sendai for 4, Elizabeth comes to visit, a trip to Okinawa with three friends, I turn 23, and have a joint birthday party with my friend Jess.  What more could I want!

It's just another manic monday!  Actually, things here at school are incredibly quiet.  No classes, no students, no work...basically that leaves me searching the internet, reading, or watching the clock anxiously awaiting the end of the day.  Anyway, last week I was one of the guest ALT`s at the Izumi High School Winter English Camp.  So here is a brief overview of my experiences at the camp.   Most importantly, it was a lot of fun and a nice change of pace from the hours I ordinarily would have spent sitting at school doing absolutely nothing.  6 of the 7 other ALT's at the camp were loads of fun and it was definitely an incredible group they threw together.  Each of us was assigned a group of 10 students (I was group B) and the camp consisted of speech presentations, culture quizes, language classes(I taught Finnish), song performances, and drama productions.  Initially I thought I was given the Best group (Group B!) but early on I learned that the B stood for Bad group.   Some of my students were caught buying beers from the vending machines (yes there are beer vending machines everywhere in this country), one was kicked out for smoking, 7
