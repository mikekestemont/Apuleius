So. It's friday afternoon, and I have less than an hour of work left, and I'm bored as hell because I managed to finish everything I needed to do, and I'm too much of a chicken to ask the bloke in charge whether I can skive off home. He'd probably say yes, but it'd go against the efficient, professional image I need to project right now. So.  Since I seem to be using this as a place to write down things without expecting anyone to read them, I figure that I may as well write about what I'm thinking about right now. I don't think I have significant, earth-shattering things to say. I couldn't care less about Iraq, or the American elections. It took me quite a while to realise that Bush is running again. We don't have a tv right now, so I tend to be a bit out of touch unless I remember to look at the online newspapers in the mornings. I've been thinking about home recently. It tends to happen round about this time of the year. It's been seven months since I was last at home, which is, as far as I can remember, the longest I've been away. Even when I was at varsity I tended to go home every couple of months, even if it was just for the day. It's quite easy when it's just two hours away. Not too taxing petrol or time-wise. Right now it would take around 11 hours to get home, assuming that bits don't fall off my car on the way there. The petrol would cost around R700 (divide by 6 to get dollars). It's not exactly an option even if I had the money to spare right now, since I'd get to spend a maximum of 36 hours there before having to come back to be at work monday morning.  Nah. I'll just wait patiently for christmas. My parents live, and have lived since the early 70's, in a three bedroom house half an hour's drive outside of Port Elizabeth along the coast towards Cape Town. That doesn't really mean much for anyone not South African. Port Elizabeth is fairly easy to find. Get hold of a map of the southern bit of Africa, and find South Africa. That's very easy. It's the big bit right at the bottom. Anything short of a truly useless map will at least show Johannesburg and Cape Town. Maybe Durban and Bloemfontein too. Port elizabeth is ahlfway along the coast between Cape Town and Durban. There are two little hookish bays around there. The left one is St Francis Bay, the right one is Algoa Bay, and the cape between them is where Port Elizabeth starts, curving around Algoa Bay. My parents' house is on the left side of the cape, PE on the right. I grew up with the sound of the sea. Very poetic, and all that, but also completely true. If you run very fast and don't trip on the rough path, you can get from my b
