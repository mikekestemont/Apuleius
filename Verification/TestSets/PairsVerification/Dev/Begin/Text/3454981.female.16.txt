This is my first (but soon to be annual) song of the day:  Run  by Snow Patrol
Good resource.
I am confused...but believe me, it isn't the first or the last time I ever will be. How is anyone supposed to be able to interpret a person's intentions? I sort of wish it was like old times again, where a guy would send flowers to a girl that symbolized something like their intentions. And leading someone on could only last for so long. Or the simple angle of a fan could ask the questions you don't want to voice. And when at a dinner party, when a girl stood up, the guys at the table would even stop what they were saying and stand up as well---as a sign of respect and courtesy and downright sweet chivalry.   So I have decided to dedicate today's post to all I know about the language of flowers; if anyone actually reads this, then this is a message for all you guys(if any):  Flower language= brownie points w/ any girl message for girls: tell your boyfriend or whoever about flower language.

"It was a year. Not a good or bad year, but it was a year. It was the best of times; it was the worst of times. I forgive you for beating on me after I accidentally knocked your folder on the floor, spilling all the alphabetized papers. No matter how much I apologized, you continued to beat me senseless. I still have the scars. Also, don't forget my manliness.  This sentence has no meaning. Nor does this one.  Pointless space  And they lived happily ever after. THE END?                                555-9897*                 Cheech"   Today, in school, I passed around my yearbook to various friends of mine. Although I only have about 10 signatures at this point in time, I think that out of this year (and all other years of my schooling which are very many) that this was the best thing anyone has ever written in my yearbook. It's riddled with many somewhat pointless inside jokes and makes light of the situation at hand. The school year is over, he wants me to call him...but that's also another inside joke for another day's explanation.   *Number changed for privacy.     By the way...                                   +The End+                                +For the moment+
I loved the Ataris for a long time, then sort of got sick of them, but this song is one I haven't gotten sick of. By the way...the fetus thing in the side bar, don't worry I'm not a psycho kind of person, I just thought the whole emo thing was kinda funny.
I just found someone else's blog who seems to have them same the same philisophical thoughts/needs/whatever as I do. Here's the link:  urlLink more(of)_me   The only difference is that as much as he loves God, I am just as angry at Him. For some reason when I say that, it really hurts--you would think that with as much anger as I have at Him, I wouldn't care. But the funny thing is that I do. M
