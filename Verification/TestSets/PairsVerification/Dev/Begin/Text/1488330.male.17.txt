Hello, I am just starting this for the NetNav class.  Feel free to read any of our postings and use it for tech stuff.
Hey Thomas - we missed you...we had an interesting discussion on the atomic bomb...the pushing of sugar is very interesting...comparable to the big companies making money off adolescents at Skyview - disguised as Vending Machines and Food Products....  Mr. Ray wants to be invited to our US History Blog - and I have the list of sixth period students.
Just some interesting things to note from Henretta about WWII Rationing:  "People found it especially hard to cut back on sugar.....the manufacturers of products such as Coca-Cola and Wrigley's chewing gum received unlimited quantities fo sugar by convincing the government tha their products helped the morale of the men and women in the armed forces". Woooooooo we are really really a nation addicted to sugar.  But what's more interesting: "Congress imposed a nationwide speed limit of 35 miles per hour...as a result, highway death rates dropped dramatically." WOW!!!!! Speed limit NATIONWIDE at 35 mph.......Man in today's lightning pace stressful lives......Such a speed limit would certainly kill off lots of people!!!!!!!!!!
Unfortunately, Ms.Clark, I will be gone all day tomorrow (for MUN) and on Friday (for NWSE), and both days are apparently discussion days. But hopefully you or some other students can post interesting discussion topics here to keep me and others who will be absent informed.   I do believe that there are lessons to be learned in history so to avoid similar conflicts, patterns, and cycles of violences (otherwise there is no point in enthusiastically studying history). Things do occur in similar way just because of natural ways of human interactions, reactions, and emotions.   And that the dropping of the atomic bomb poses an interesting question and potential debate. I personally don't have a strong opinion of that right now simply because it's such a complex issue.   Oh yeah, and don't forget to invite all the talkative sixth period students to this discussion blog!
Hey - very interesting tidbits...Thomas thank you for starting the AP Blog - American foreign policy is very complex - I wonder what would have happened if American intervened in the Spanish American War - would World War II erupted earlier - would Hitler's Final Solution been avoided or defeated before the horrible consequences.  It is so easy to make or critique our past and qualify it as a mistake.  I have never really understood the quote..."we must remember our past so we aren't condemned to repeat it ."  We will never be able to repeat the past...it is so different...however we continue to behave as humans do? How can we repeat something that is so different - or do we repeat the same instances with superior technology.     "Under God" - did you know they added that phrase in the 50s during the cold war?  America's rally around Freedom...Goodness and Godliness...Cold War propaganda?   I enjoyed reading your blogs - What are your thoughts on America's decision to drop the bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki?    Prediction: On the f
