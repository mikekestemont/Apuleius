The Interim ("Canada's pro-life, pro-family newspaper") has an article on some of the newly-elected young Conservative MPs, including a couple of friends of mine who managed to get themselves elected. Interestingly, it shows that these young MPs are ardently socially conservative, thus mirroring recent Gallup poll findings which shows strong support for traditional family values amongst the younger generation, a rebellion against the permisiveness of the 1960s and the legacy of horror that it left. As discouraging as the election results were on many fronts, it's certainly encouraging to know that the tide is turning and the party is in good hands.

The article that I just posted reminded me of one I had read a few years back by (in my humble opinion) one fo the greatest libertarian scholars in history, one Walter Block. In response to growing assaults against female students on his campus, his solution was as follows:  " Require that all female students own a pistol or other means of self defense; (e.g., pepper spray or mace, stun gun or other electric shock device) and carry it with them at all times.

While you're there, take a few minutes (or better yet, a few hours) and read his archives on the  urlLink www.lewrockwell.com  website and be in awe of the most consistent libertarian theory you are likely ever to find.
Mike Adams, a columnist at David Horowitz's  urlLink www.frontpagemag.com  has posted a great article in which he sent a letter to campus women's groups (sorry, I believe they prefer "wimmins") offering to assist their efforts to combat violence against women by training them in proper use of handguns.  An excerpt.....  "Dear Women’s Center: My name is Mike Adams. I am an Associate Professor of Criminal Justice at UNC Wilmington, and a regular columnist for the  urlLink Heritage Foundation ’s  urlLink Townhall.com . I am also a member of the NRA and a weekly commentator at  urlLink NRANews.com . I am writing to offer my expertise, free of charge, to Women’s Centers around the nation that are interested in combating violence against women. … It is my opinion that the response to the problem of violence against…female students has lacked a diversity of viewpoint. Specifically, there has been a lack of discussion about the possible benefits of gun ownership among women, particularly those who have been harassed, stalked, or otherwise victimized in the past. As such, I would love the opportunity to visit your campus to talk about the following: *The benefits and responsibilities of gun ownership in general.*The desirability of concealed carry permits for women.*The basic rules governing the use of deadly force.
