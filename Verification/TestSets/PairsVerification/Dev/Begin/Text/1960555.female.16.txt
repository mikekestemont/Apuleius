I think I got the flu.  I'm just kinda weird feeling right now.  Not tired or anything, but I have the whole stomach ache thing going on.  Who really knows though.  I'm thinking it's not a good thing for me to be this sick though.  I didn't eat yesterday.  (haha, y'all are like -GASP-)  I almost hurled at breakfast; eggs are not your friend when sick.  Then I struggled though to the night on just Diet Coke.  But when I saw The RunDown at 7.00 I felt much better and ate a ton of Nibs.  And some of Tiff's popcorn.  And a lot of Rootbeer.  Yea that's a healthy day's worth of food.  Oh, did I mention that I turned down my Dad's pear pie.  That's how shitty I felt.  I'm feeling quite a bit better today though.  I'm still not eating.  Maybe I'm just having one of my unintentional food boycotts.  I do that from time to time.
I so over analyze things.
'Infatuate' - It doesn't look like a simple word- Not a word that's short, concise-  'Like' -  'Friend' - Their simple- To the point- They have no baggage- Not the way  'Infatuation'  does- Heavy on the palate- You know there's something more- Something lurking beneath the letters-  'Bryce' -  'Infatuation' - Similar, aren't they- In a complexity sense- Neither has a  'best described as....' - Both unknown- Both frustrating as hell-

This is a good day.   GOB has decided to grace this dreary little town of Victoria with their presence.   I'm so going to see them at Legends, unless my parents decide to be cute and drag me up to Cowichan for the Thanksgiving weekend, making me miss the show.   Would it be childish to give them the silent treatment if they make me miss it?   Are they going to use the Warped Tour against me?   I miss Janine. Come home sis.
In a technical sense that mean the Day Of Manda, seeing as my Dad's nick name for me is Boo, but anyways.  Hallowe'en here today, as I'm sure all y'all know.  Totally gonig trick-or-treating today with Maimes and Gena. I also have two goals for tonight.  1) Break Justine out of her house (she got grounded for the simple reason that her muther went temperarily insane) so she can some and the shit scared out of her with the three of us, and 2) Make some random little kid cry.  I have decided that I'm going to scare all of the little kids who come to get candy.  (and it's mearly a bonus that that will leave us kids with ample amounts of candy).  Yea,  I also have it under good authority that Shane (Maimes' older brother) and his friend Scott(y) will be spending the night, here with us, at Maimes'.  Off I go now to pick up a movie with the girlies, and because Gena hasta talk to her boy...... Gottta run before violence ensues.  Late,
Hmm, t
