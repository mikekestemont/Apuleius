Abrams, PA. 1995. Montonic or unimodal diversity-productivity gradients: what does competition theory predict? Ecology 76(7): 2019-2027.  I like this article in a way... which is good since it's pretty important to my thesis... but reading anything by any of the biodiversity theory bigwigs can lead to headaches if one is not cautious.  It's one of those I keep having to re-read since A) it is (or I am) dense and B) I come up with new questions to find answers to or citations for.  Ok... being waved goodnight by a departing professor...  Well, back to reading.
Ecology has a moving wall of 4. That's 4 years between the time it is published and the time articles are available electronically through JSTOR.  I know this, but I just tend to get overly optimistic and think clicking "find a copy" will work anyway just to be nice, even when the pub date is, oh, Jan 04.  Ach besonders.
It's been kind of a long day. Going home for dinner, then coming back here.  Picked a field assistant... rather she volunteered... and should have been the obvious choice due to availability, now that I think about it. She doesn't seem to like fieldwork. But she is willing to do it and has done it so far (including today). So... I'm happy with the outcome. She plans to continue next semester so that's less training to do as well. And she is meticulous about cleaning the lab so I think she definitely has attention to detail. Which is a definite plus.  Today was spent searching for chicken wire constructs with a memeber of my committee, not finding them, and then purchasing chicken wire to supplement the roll we already had. So a trip to the hardware store and 5 rolls later.... we have cut almost 2/3 of it to cover my plots. Tomorrow will be spent cutting the remainder, taking it out to the fields, and pinning it down with steel pins. Should be a lot of fun. My new field hat is certainly coming in handy. As is the handy cool-pack neck-wrap thingy I bought at Comfest. With those and my bandana on my head, and wearing overalls, the professor who went out with me and this other guy in his lab (his REU student) laughed and said I looked like I was off to preschool. You see I had my field notebook and a box of Crayola colored pencils in my pocket of my overalls. What can I say, the colored pencils work brilliantly on the "write in the rain" paper. And if that looks silly... well then it's time I came to terms with looking silly anyway.  Besides my previous jobs haven't allowed conveniently nearby places to get water or take a break from the heat... or if they did I wanted to avoid the air conditioning to keep from freaking my body out with the temperature flip-flop. So I dress for fieldwork like I mean it. I just happen to be at a place where you can get away with not dressing h
