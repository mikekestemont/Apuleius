Hi folks, today I create my first blog. I'd never thought of making a blog before, I made this one just to get a Gmail account :P but hopefully it will be fun.   What I've Been Doing:   Well yesterday was my girlfriend's birthday and she came over for the whole day - most of which we spent naked ;) I bought her a necklace, a union jack thong (that she asked for and looks great in :D), a rose and, using the Far Cry engine, I made her a map - a collection of desert island that spelt out "Simon [heart] Kirsty". She loved it all and I got a very... nice thankyou ;) Oh, and I made her a cake and dinner too.  I had maths homework to do, but I've forgotten how to do most of it, so whether I will get round to it is questionable.   What I've Been Playing:   I've been playing Hitman Contracts on PC the last couple of days and I'm liking it. I seem to resort to violece a bit too much for the genre but its fun and that's what counts.   In the News:   According to Chinese state media, dozens of drug dealers have been sentenced to death. Not because China is that tough on drugs/barbaric, but to celebrate International Anti-Drugs Day! How quaint...  Michael Moore's new film, Faranheit 9/11, has made $8 million on the first day. I'm quite looking forward to seeing this film [expect my opinions on it soon] but I fear most people will see it because it's the thing to do, and not really watch the film the way it should be watched.   Other Stuff:   All should be on the look out for a new worm being spread by popular websites. The code exploits a hole in Internet Explorer and redirects you to a Russian site that tries to install the code. To check if you are infected:  Click the Start button and then click on Search   Make sure you choose the option to look through all files and folders   Search for files called Kk32.dll and Surf.dat   If infected use up to date anti-virus software to remove malicous code  That's all for now, see you... whenever.  cvx  Thought of the Post: Is mockery a form of ignorance or a form of enlightenment?
Hey ho. Back from school, felt like a very long day and I'm uber tired so I must get to bed early tonight. Unfortunately this means I will have more homework to do tomorrow which means I won't be able to play Planetside until Wednesday which I really need to [see  What I've Been Playing ]   What I've Been Doing:   School today. My English teacher tells me that she forgot to right on my coursework draft that I had to put in a load of stuff on camera angles (media piece on Bowling for Columbine) so I have English coursework to do :( I also have to revise for my maths exam on Wednesday and do loads of science homework for then. Not... cool...   What I've B
