:) went to Changi Naval Base for the Navy Open House with my parents today. At first we thought that unauthoritised vehicles wont be allowed in the vicinity of the area. That's why there is a shuttle bus service at the Singapore Expo. So we drove to Expo and went there to take the bus. Then we saw this unexpected and large crowd queuing for the bus!! My gosh, it was really really packed with lots of people and the queue extended from inside Expo all the way out to the MRT Station. So my parents and I decided to have a change of plans. Since it was getting late and the Open House ends pretty soon, like 6 or 7pm when it was already 5pm, why don't we come again the next day. All of us were very hungry, so we decided to get ourselves some food at the Food Fair going on in one of the halls. But we couldn't find the hall and decided to dine at Burger King. Then we saw the poster of the Navy Open House. It was till 9pm. So we went to look at the queue and realised that the organisers were pretty efficient in getting the people up the shuttle buses and the buses came continuously. So, we returned to Plan A: Go to the Navy Open House. Well, time passed really fast. Half an hour and we already got a shuttle bus. Sounds a lot but judging from the amount of people there, its rather good already. Well, the place was pretty good. But it was a pity we got there too late. When we took enough pictures of the boats and submarines and looking at the exhibitions, the rides and games and stalls were all closing already. The poster wrote that it was till 9pm but effectively, 7pm to 9pm there was nothing going on except some disco stuffs. So, technically speaking, it ends at 7pm.. Oh well, not that I didn't enjoy myself. It was rather fun. I like taking pictures and took quite a lot of them today :) The return trip wasn't as simple. Everyone was going home at the same time so there's this big mass of people walking to the shuttle bus stop. Then because it was already dark, no one could tell that we have already reached the queue. Then apparently the crowd didn't walk in a straight line and everything was in a mess. The authorities took a pretty long time to figure out that the way to stop the mess was to break a part of the crowd and then regulate the human traffic moving into the queue.  Stuck in that mess for 40 mins. Hot, stuffy, squeezy.. It was practically a feast for mosquitoes. But oh well, we made it out alive :) Just got home. It's pretty fun, despite the queue on the way back haha :)
Well, not feeling very good today and so I decided to not go to school. Woke up pretty late today at around 11am.. H
