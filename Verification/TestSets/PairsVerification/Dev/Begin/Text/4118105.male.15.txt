Not much has been happening the past few days. I had a LAN tuesday, Erik had one Thursday (?). His, of course, was bigger, but they were both pretty fun.  Friday I got up early to head out to orientation at Marion Steele. Eek. That school is absolutely gigantic. I'm going to have a hard time trying to find my way around, I know that already.  Looks like fun :)  After that I tried getting some sleep, because, well, I really didn't get all that much that night. My old bed completely fell apart, and the new one is just hell. H-E-L-L. I swear. I was up for literally hours, tired and completely pissed off. Tossing and turning didn't help, so I just ripped the damn mattress up and tossed it onto the floor upside down. Sure, it was lopsided with a comforter and pillow underneath it- but anything was better than that bed. From hell.  Well I didn't get to sleep. Yeah, I was tired. But my little brother was doing his usual annoying "Hey, look! I can act like I'm homosexual and be cool at the same time!" thing. So I just started up FFX and overdrived some Aeons.  Then Joe picked me up to do stuff. That stuff started out by going to Zack's house. We watched him play Chronicles of Riddick for like two hours before leaving again. Joe fell asleep and we had to wake him up with pen missiles.  First off? The Exchange. Bleh. I'll never understand people's obsessions with "buying" music.  Then Fazoli's, where I was tempted by bread sticks and Italian food poop. I wasn't hungry, but that didn't stop Joe from trying to bug me about not having anything to eat. Seriously, Joe. I had twenty friggin' bucks in my pocket. If I wanted to eat, all I'd have to do was move three feet to order.  Then where, I hear you ask. Giant Eagle. Where I got scammed.  Zack, the considerate guy he is, took my twenty dollars and bought 3 tickets for the movies. I got a dollar back, along with some change. Total cost? $16. Bastard.  We saw the holiday buyer's guide of OXM. It totally sucked. I mean, this thing reeked of something that smells very bad. I can not put into words how disappointingly ripped off I would have felt if I bought it. As I said before, "crap crap crap!"  Off to Cobblestone, at last. We went to see Garden State, but that wouldn't be on for almost an hour. So, to Alien vs. Predator. That was pretty... underwhelming. We saw it from the part where the chick makes friends with the Predator. Seriously. W-T-F.  Anyway, the movie was kind of boring at that point. All the way to the end. Yawn.  So, to Garden State when it ended. Now  this  was a good movie. Sure, not the greatest- but compared to AvP it was like the second coming of Jesus.  One part made me think of the whistle scene from FFX. Yeah. That confirms t
