I didn't get a reply from my brother yet. Wonder how is he now...maybe sibuk sangat.takper. Ari ni seperti biaser takder aper yang menarik kat sekolah. Just a few things yang really interesting. My teacher organized an activity that  I enjoyed so much. Best giler ( coz English is my fav subj. ). But Biology... alaa..malasnyer nak bacer buku. Trial will be in a fortnight. Next week is holiday. Maybe waktu tu baru struggle betul2 . kalau tak mana leh gi Australia cam my beloved bro kan? Oh ya... my teacher also tell a story about her student who now is in Russia. Well, it really make me excited. It is fun to be in a new environment and learn many new things. Well.. i wonder macamana agaknya tinggal di Australia?
