What is it about warm weather that turns hetero men into brain damaged "an anvil just fell on me" victims? Very weird. It doesn't even matter if the women are amply clothed, in layers..if the sun is shining and it's May or later there are women all over the city fighting men off with sticks.  Interestingly enough,  urlLink Slash 's Identical Twin asked me out on the subway today. He was hairy, tattooed, not wearing a shirt underneath his leather vest, very afroed, wearing a weird hat and ripped jeans with magic marker drawings all over them, holding a cigarette, and had black teeth. His approach was to get up and stare at my face, then ask me what I was doing for the day. It was hard not to laugh. Ordinarily I'd feel a twinge of guilt about that, but he was awfully persistent..must've asked me five times if I wanted to go out and have a drink with him.     I should've asked what kinda goofballs he was hepped up on. As he was trying to step off the train he crashed into the doors before they opened.
After having watched the original  urlLink Fast Times at Ridgemont High DVD , I must hail to the chief that is  urlLink Cameron Crowe . He's like the grandaddy of the young person's character film.

So apparently the new DVD has all the deleted scenes in it, which i would love to see. However if I ordered it I would have the VHS, original DVD and rerelease DVD. That may be overkill, even for me.
It's a bad sign when you've been using a laptop for 14 consecutive hours simply because you've got a new toy to play with.  But I do have to confess that  urlLink I love mine ...      urlLink Lucy  is in my lap dreaming as I type this. I guess she knows there's something new competing with her attention.
...makes you feel like a woman.  YIPPEE!  I just realised that since my date has been pushed back I can go see the  urlLink Magnetic Fields  concert on July 3.  Who wants to come with me?
Have I ever been spoiled getting all this time with the cats during the day. Lucy is sitting in my lap right now and I'm coming to realise I'll only have a couple more weeks to bask in their adorable ways before having to leave them for at least a year.  Do you think she knows?     I've also been listening to the song  urlLink Babies  by Pulp a l
