&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rating : ** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seen Via : In The The Theaters &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buy This Movie : Not Yet Available  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was honestly not a very good &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;movie. I really loved the actual premise &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of it, though: evil fighting evil. The necromongers were pretty damn cool, as were the Furians, which is what Vin Diesel's character Riddik is. They didn't delve deep enough into the story, however. What was with the Furian eyes? I know they were special, but we just don't know. Also, this movie was too predictable.  All in all, this movie was exactly as I had expected it. The plot was flimsy, but the action was good. The dialogue was absolutely hilarious, though. My favorite line was this one: "It's been a long time since I smelled beautiful," uttered by Riddik. Damn, I almost had to hold my hand over my mouth to keep from laughing to that.

urlLink One Word   Home is where the heart is. Home is the place where I feel most comfortable. No matter how old I am, whenever I have a sleepover I miss my bed. It's just a response to the loss of familiarity. I also feel so comfortable at home because I'm with people who will never stop loving me, even if I say stupid things.
urlLink Random Inspiration    List 10 words that you hate.    Weird. It's so hard to spell!   Finally. For the same reason   Hair. When you say it with my, your words slur together in the most annoying way. Plus, I hate mine and get teased about it often, so hearing the word only brings to mind the teasing.   Like. It's way overused. I find the whole valley-girl thing very annoying   Coffee. It's weird, and I hate coffee.   Antidisestablishmentarianism. It's long, it's gangly, and it's just annoying.   Homies. WHY IS THIS WORD USED! WHY CALL PEOPLE homies WHEN YOU CAN JUST CALL THEM FRIENDS? IT'S STUPID! Plus, it's the same length as friend, so what's the point?   Retard. It's used in the wrong fashion (I do it, so I guess I shouldn't complain), and often. It's also a word that isn't associated with good things.   Sexy. It's just annoying.   Yo. Damn, that word annoys me. Why do you say yo when you mean you or hello? It's only one letter different from you, and there's already an abbreviation for hello. It's hi. So shut up with the yo thing, okay?
urlLink Blog Ideas    How long have you been blogging?  I've been blogging since October 27, 2003. So, it's been over seven months since I began. I had my first blog until March 2004, and got a new one then. I moved to my own domain some time in June or July (haven't put it up yet, so I don't know!)
