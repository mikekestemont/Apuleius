Wow, what a great (and long) weekend.  I went up to Casper pretty early on Friday (cuz no one has anything for me to do and I was sick of waiting.)  In any case I went and played 9 holes at the country club with Keith and Meg.  Too bad I am so much better than Keith, otherwise it could have been less embarassing for both of us!  Saturday I had a BBQ with a bunch of friends.  Grilled up some roasts and just had a dandy time playing a little monkey ball.  God I love that monkey ball!  Sunday was mostly a family day.  I watched Miracle (the olympic hockey one) and we went to see Shrek 2.  An awesome movie if I do say so myself.  Made me want to go rent the first one again.  Monday was visiting the people I missed the rest of the weekend and driving home.  And it is a long drive home.  But I suppose it isn't 17 hours...so that is ok!  Have a good week everyone.  At least it is a short one.
One really nice thing about starting my job when I did is that I get a vacation almost right away.  Woohoo!  Memorial day rocks man!  But anyway, I am heading back to my hometown for the long weekend and am really looking forward to some quality time with the couch up there.  Really I should go play some tennis...but no one really does.  Oh I guess Meg, but we gotta learn her first.  Work still blows.  The little bit of work they do give me is sizing poop pipe.  (1) Not difficult (2) Come on, poop pipe.  Feeling better though.  Felt way nasty this morning so I went home a bit early (YAY SICK LEAVE!)    Have a good extended weekend and talk to ya'll Monday!
Ahhh, so I rented the Return of the King tonight.  Unlike the Matrix movies, which went from pretty cool to mind numbingly stupid, the Lord of the Rings just got better as it went.  All I could do was complain about how much I hated the ending of the first one.  It just kind of ended...so anti climatic. But you know what?  It was all worth it in the end.  Now I just need to convince myself to sit and watch them through from beginning to end one day.  I hope I have too much stuff to do though.  9 hours can make for a long day.  And boy do I mean that.  The damn project I was working on is gone.  So I sit at work taking the meal scrappings from engineers who do have something to do.  I sat from 1 until 5:30 today pretty much staring.  I hate that.  It is this reason that I hated the first few months in Cali.  I can only pray that I get something decent to work on...and soon!  Oh, but my new wok rules!
The reception started out like most.  The ice sculpture was brimming with shrimp and cocktail sauce.  The cheesedip was covered in walnuts, a
