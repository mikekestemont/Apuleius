Because Nici Paggs is awesome, I decided to add a poll to our blog too. Hope you enjoy. Hey Nici, in our poll death IS an option. Heh.
What up. Whoops, I skipped a day.....oh well executive privilege. Plus that last post got some pretty long replies, but I guess that's politics for you. Just got back from a nice run. Lately I've been running a whole lot, not sure why. It just makes me feel better that I eat way too much crap I guess. Meh. Onto other things. Today I plan to worry some more about how two hurricanes are blasting their way right through Morgan's cruise. The best part is I haven't heard from her since Saturday, nor can I due to excessive phone bills and ironic circumstances. So today's paper informs me that I know nothing about flirts twin hurricanes, or her safety. I have one word for that. Shit. Beyond that I plan to blast some heads off and get AWPed a lot while playing Counterstrike. Its fun and it helps me relax with all the crazy stuff going on in my life. Its been so crazy lately, that its even more crazy than crazy. Nah, I'm such a liar, nothing is going on. I thought I'd jazz things up a bit. Oh and the iPod still rocks. Whoever can correctly identify the source of this posts title first gets a whole post dedicated to them.
What up. It feels good to finally be back in New York. Now that I'm home I have some concerns to voice. I think everyone needs to chill with the extreme views on both Bush and Kerry. On one side, Bush is not the evil money grabbing oil tycoon mass murderer as everyone on the loony left is claiming. If extreme liberal Michael Moore is to become the ultimate authority on the truth, then I am deporting myself to England. While I'm sure some of his movie was somewhat close to the truth, his 'facts' do not convince me. How can you listen to someone so totally bias in everything they say? Its difficult for me to believe he didn't tilt a little left with some of the material. So give Bush a break, everything he does from a round of golf to important speeches seems to upset everyone so much. Everyone says he talks stupid, yeah well he has a pretty damn good education, no doubt about that. But enough with criticisms of the Liberals, the Conservative side has its many issues as well. John Kerry is not a criminal who stole a Vietnam record, Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. He served his time, so give it a rest. He saved a life. He was brave. I do agree with looking further into his record only for the fact that he made an integral part of his campaign beefing up his heroism, but stop the slander for crying out loud. This is a political race, not a finger pointing who-sucks-more-a-thon. This election is almost as bad as the Miller/Budweiser commercial w
