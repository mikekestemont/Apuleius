or,  in the room the women come and go/talking of michaelangelo  (t.s. eliot) last night's dinner, though it suffered from an identity crisis, was an ostensible success, though i was quite ill after.  wontons are hard to make, or, actually, it's more like it's hard to make wontons maintain their structural integrity.  pumpkin and yellow split-pea soup was also a success.
i think spring was skipped, and i fear so was summer. i feel as though i've been eviscerated, inexplicably so, my organs liquified. after a relatively heavy talk last night, i'm feeling lagged.  what began two weeks ago as a very freaky vision/flashback when i was performing transformed to  the mystery of the scarf  and moderately intrusive memories of details without narrative content.  now that same thread became a heavy knowledge.  about my mother.  something i already knew, but every realization that concurs with that knowledge weighs on me heavier.  i feel almost as though i was more wronged by her failure to protect me -- her failure to recognize that i needed protection, her tacit acceptance of what he did as his right -- than i was by my father's direct harms.  in a sense, though, i know it's wrong to believe that; i know that she was likely not in a position to contest his actions, or didn't think she was (how can i presume to speak for her experience?  i'm not sure i believe this but need to say i do).  enough of this.  i'll deal.
this has been one of the most non-productive weekends in my life.  i was planning to get so much done, yet i've managed almost nothing -- except i finished sorting through records on trauma & typing that bibliography for DMC.  unfortunately, i exceeded my alotted hours for last week, but sometimes i just have to work when i'm motivated or nothing gets done. my social schedule next week is insane; most of it's fun, but there will be a serious lack of quiet time.  in addition to being busy with social stuff every night between tuesday and next sunday, i'm also trying to find an apartment: the sweet deal i though i had fell through when Bo's sister decided not to move. now i'm grumbly & trying to decide if it's really worth the trouble to move.
i'm about to do something that's either incredibly brave or incredibly stupid...actually, knowing me, it's probably a bit of both.  i'm finally going to send some poetry to journals, rather than just say i should.  it's a bit stress inducing, particularly since i just realized that i've formatted my submissions incorrectly for one of the journals.  i figure i can't back down if i post it publicly.  at least, i can't back down without looking like a wimp.
the title of this post says it all: it has been an absolutely marvelous day here in the peg -- up to 23 degrees, sunny.  i'd forgotten just how good i can feel in the summer, just how pleasurable it is to feel my bones and muscles in movement -
