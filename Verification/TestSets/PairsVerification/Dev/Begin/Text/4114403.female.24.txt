I get so frustrated some days. It's funny because on the days I don't want anything to happen...something comes up, and I have to rearrange my life to fit whatever it is. Then, on the days I long for something....there's nothing. Welcome to adulthood, right?             I'm so tired. People wear me down....I end up saying yes when I want to say no. I don't trust anyone anymore. They all have agendas and intentions....they gossip and lie. They say they love you when they don't. People don't think before they act. They never think of the consequences...the people they hurt....the way they affect the world.      It's kind of disgusting.           I know not everyone is bad. But, I think some days, it's hard to see past that and look on the positive side.  You let someone into your life, and they slam the door the second you think they're trustworthy. They abandon you. Once again....the story of my life.         So, I guess the question for myself is why I constantly open myself back up to that hurt after years and years of people abusing me in one form or another.         I am a loyal to a fault. In fact, I am willing to let people walk all over me. I let them take advantage of me...and when I speak up...they laugh, like it's so cute that I'm standing up for myself.      I am so loyal and friendly, that I've let people lure me into a false sense of security. And then, right when I don't expect it....they drop whatever it is on me. They steal from me physically and emotionally. They try to hurt my self-esteem or they outright lie to me.           I have had very few true friends in my life. I've had even fewer true love's. Actually...just one...and so far, he's never ever let me down. Thank God for that....because he is my anchor. And, sometimes I'm so stupid...I don't deserve him....            Somehow I'm going to have to take a look at myself and figure out what part of my personality doesn't get it. What part of me keeps trying when obviously nothing is going to change? Which part of my brain tells me to keep talking to someone who obviously hates you...why do I bother them and think they want to be my friend....? What's even more stupid is that I don't really even want to have contact with them. I just want to forget and not be angry anymore....     What part of me is willing to give and give and give until I can't anymore. What part of me wants to keep doing for others until I can't possibly do anymore.....?          The only thing that keeps me from being hurt is to learn a lesson and hold it close to my heart. To hold grudges and hate. I am not that kind of person....no matter how hard I try to be. I am not capable.      There's got to be an answer somewhere......
What paradise have you lost....?         When you're young...people tell you to enjoy your youth. You're supposed to t
