Insomnia. Do you suppose that could be  an invisible person that's touching me  just at the time that I shutter my eyes  and my breath starts to whisper inaudible sighs;  my consciousness curls up and rolls deep inside;  my body turns fluid and spreads flat and wide.  And just at that point where I enter the land  of restoring my person, there must come a hand,  and that palm might just push me or jar me a bit,  or those fingers may tenderly flutter and flit,  and the movement is not quite enough to discern,  but it wakes me and next I find that I yearn  to be back in that space lacking senses and light,  to rest and to dream through the peace of the night.

He was always my Boy, I knew from the start. A gift from the Lord to brighten my heart. He had his own rhythm, he sang his own song, He tested his limits as to right and to wrong.  Then a cloud settled on him like a cold, clammy mist And tamped down his life's light with a rock solid fist. But then one day reason and common sense grew And the spirit to live and to fight trickled through.  Then came the day when he thought he had found His soul mate, and gently true love did abound.
