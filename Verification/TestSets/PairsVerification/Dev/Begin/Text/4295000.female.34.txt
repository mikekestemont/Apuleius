HI   i went to take stephanie to school on July 28th 2002 and driving normal as usual.The girls in their seatbelts and I see a car (truck) spiral out of control from a turn and coming right at me.He hit us head on.I recall crying hysterical cause of my children and my van being crushed.My knee went right into the dashboard and my neck/shoulders was KILLING me because during impact I had to turn around and look at my children.I believe this is what started my pain.I was very concerned for Ashley at the momment for crying hysterical how she banged her head and her back.The ambulance put her in a stretcher and put her in the ambulance.Stephanies knee was totally swollen.I felt a sharp pain in my back , it felt like I couldn't breathe...plus I could NOT move my head to the left side at all.:( My 2 yr old baby was the ONLY one who came out without ANY pain that i know of..just a few little bruises.She was scared of cars for a few days afterwards as well but today is doing well.From time to time she'l say mamma car went "BOOM"..and slam her hands together.SO precious.      We got to the hospitol and got xtrays done.I got some pain medication,muscle relaxers and told i had some nice spasms on my neck.My shoulder was very puffy and I was surprised that the dr didn't seem very concerned but again concentrated on my children.I mentioned my knee was hurting but please take care of Stephanies knee who at the time was VERY swollen,I had a fear it was broken=*(    Ashley came out and we all went home.The first night at home was HORRIBLE.I could not sleep due to the neck.I could NOT sleep unless I slept with my head straight facing up.I used pillows and no matter what I could NOT get comfortable.My neck was a BIG issue for days..the lack of being able to move it.I seen my regular MD 2 days later and told her about my neck and she as well saw the bump above my shoulder and was concerned about my knee.My knee which i NEVER EVER had a problem with in my entire life is not acting up BADLY=*( It started with a nice bang on the van...(wondering if Air bag deployed if that would've helped that)...and now I feel a "PIN" n NEEDLE pain...and It also gives "out".During the night I have to sit up in PAIN to straighten it out.It takes a GOOD 5 minutes,and this is just to go to the bathroom.By the time I come back....between my knee and my lower back and neck issues it is truley affecting my sleeping habits.Coming mornings I am still very tired.      Ashley complained about her back for approx 2 weeks...woke us up crying a few times.I almost took her out of cheerleading and didn't get the dr's signature for cheerleading till I felt that she is 'safer' to go cheerleading.It is her life and It breaks my heart to see ANY tears f
