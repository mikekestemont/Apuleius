I set out to find the official meaning "hump day" and why it is called so.  I found that no one really knows who called it this first or why but assume that the person was either a really big perv or hated their life so much that they decided that Wens. was the middle of the week and if they had made it that far, Thurs. and Fri. would be ok too.  I don't really know BUT, "hump day" for me is EVERYDAY!  To me, "hump day" is any day that I put the kids in the car.  This means that I will have to "hump" to get them ready on time, I will have to double "hump" to make sure my shoes match, "humping" the diaper bag, apnea monitor, Nicholas in his car seat (23lbs all together) and Isaac by 1 arm to the car.  Then I make a "hump" sound as I lift each into my Kia Sportage 4x4.  Finally I make more "hump" noises as I buckle each child in.  FINALLY!  It is my professional opinion, as a mom, that "hump day" was created by a mother who experienced a similar experience on a daily basis.  Perhaps the reason that it is tagged onto a specific day is because back when people did things for the first time (1800's), there wasn't the convience of auto anything and "going to town day" was on Wens.  Makes sense to me.  Now that you see my way of logic, are you scared?  if so, for who are you scared? *laugh*
I've had one of those busy days where nothing is accomplished.  It started atypically.  My husband went to work 12 hours earlier.  This meant that the kids had to be woke up early.  Kids are not happy when they are woke up early to be rushed out the door to take their favorite person to work.  Nicholas was like, "um, where's my titty?"  and Isaac was generally pissed -- he didn't get his coffee.  In the rush of the morning, Daddy forgot half of the things that he needed for the week, including his pillow -- poor baby.  Isaac got in a better mood when he got to play in Daddy's "beg fruck."  Somehow the kids always make my day completely better, this happened several times today.  The first "better" was after we left Daddy at work.  Nicholas was very unhappy at this unscheduled morning trip and was literally screaming.  Isaac bent over his car seat and under the canopy of Nicholas' and said, "its otay bankie, daddy at work nda beg fruck n momma gonna go to grammas and her'll give me a cukie."  I don't know if it was Isaac talking to Nicholas or the fact that Nicholas was wondering .oO well, don't I get a cookie? Oo.  Needless to say, it worked and Nicholas happily chewed on his strap covers on the way to Grandma's.  The next "better" was at Grandma's.  Austin and Isaac were fussing over something, I can't remember now, but Isaac was very upset.  H
