The concert was AMAZING!!!  I wish I could experience this again!  I absolutely   loved   all the songs Josh sang!!!  My favorites, though, were My December, Oceano, Mi Morena, Remember When It Rained, and Never Let Go.    After the concert, Alisa, Catherine and Serge and I went over to stand next to the busses and wait for Josh to come out.  Surely, he did, but he just waved and blew kisses and hopped into the bus.  I understand its for health reasons and really because they had to leave for CA.  But anywho... we met the band (which is the next best thing, hehheh) and got their autographs and pictures.  Wow.  I never realized how easily approachable they are!  They're sooo nice!   Well...I still can't get over the fact that I have seem Josh LIVE!!!  It might take a while before I come down from cloud 9... heeheehee!!
How weird...  I just got a message from someone saying "Hi, you don't know me, but I just wanted to say hi..."  Strange thing... it was a phone number from ARKANSAS!!!  Whoa!  I just got a phone call from ARKANSAS!!  LoL.   *** I'm feeling kinda down.  I checked Ticketmaster and the only tickets available to Josh's concert is the lawn.  The LAWN!!!  I don't know if I should buy them now, or wait till the concert date and see if I can get   better   seats... *sigh*  I had a wacky dream last night.  Usually I don't get crazy dreams... that's Alisa's and Catherine's thing.  (inside joke).  But Josh was in it! He was in my living room, and he gave me a nice hug and two tickets to his concert!!!  LoL.  It was sooo real!  I know I'm sounding dilusional... aaaggh!! *** 1)Saw two of Mr. Groban's photos in the Willamette Week. 2)Message from Arkansas! 3)100% on my Anatomy Exam!  Carpe Diem!!
I just happened to stumble upon a   pitiful   show on WB tonight.  It's called something along the lines of "Superstar USA."  They've pretty much stolen American Idol's "idea."  But with a twist!  A really horrible twist!  They hold singing auditions, but they only choose the WORST singers!  They give them hopes that they are PHENOMENAL!  And apparently, once they build up their ego, they will let them know that it was all a prank.  How horrible is this??  How   low   can these producers go??  Is this what America wants to see?  People being humiliated, laughed at!!  These judges just sit there and LIE to these poor souls!  Tsk tsk...  Oh, speaking of American Idol... I hope Fantasia wins.  There's something about Diana that I dislike... But yeah... that's my spiel.  As for my daily happy list... 1)"G'morning, Hollywood." 2)I found out the chords for "Million Years From Now". 3)Got more funky lookin' shades, heehee!!
Knowing me, you would probably see that I try to make the most in life.  I try to notice those little things, that eventually make a really big difference.  Say for instance those little tiny things that make us happy each day... So... I was thinking I should list at l
