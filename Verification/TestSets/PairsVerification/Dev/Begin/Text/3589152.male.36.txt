If you do not hate people who attend protests, then you just aren't paying attention.  In DC, the mecca for political protest, you cannot avoid these people.           Protests are the only source of empowering truly stupid people with a political voice.  A very small minority of protestors, particularly the celebrity ones, do make it to the talking head shows, due either to their celebrity or to the rare ability of some to sound articulate when in fact what they are saying is entirely devoid of reason.  Even when such people make it onto to the talking head shows, it is only in the midst of the media hoopla surrounding the event.  Aside from their immediacy to the media in displaying the mindlessness that compels people to travel from all over the country to hold signs and scream for seven hours, they have no staying power in the commerce of political debate.         Being a protestor takes a rare combination of low IQ, high self-esteem, and conspiratorial outlook.  And recent trends in self-esteem focused education will only produce more protestors.  (The self-esteem education works like this: when Johnny answers that 2+2=5, no one tells him he got the wrong answer; instead they tell him that math is just a tool of oppression in the West, meant to keep him down, and that math only mattered prior to when the Western world stole algebra from the Egyptians, after which it was corrupted).  In any event, this fortunately rare combination of traits is evidenced by three facts: 1) the fact that everything they say is extremely stupid; 2) the fact they are totally unaware that everything they say is extremely stupid; and 3) the fact that they think the protest is the only way for their voice to be heard, as the conservative media shut out those "who speak truth to power."       If the Soviet Union would have broached any criticism from its population, it would have slotted its protestors in the same way it chose the general profession of all of its citizens.  At a very early age, some party hack would be interviewing the school teachers, sending the smart kids off to be engineers, the athletic kids off to train for the Olympics, and the mind-numbingly dull-witted but otherwise passionate kids off to learn the nuances of drawing large letters on signs and coloring Hitler moustaches on the face the face of the Russian premiere. Oh, and don't forget shouting loudly and interrupting traffic.      Come to think of it, the commies could have delayed the downfall of communism for another hundred years if it invoked such a strategy.  No way Reagan would have fought these guys if he associated internal resistence to Soviet rule with a bunch of people who look like they were shipped to Moscow right from a Vietnam protest at Berkely. But give some protest signs to a set of really pissed off Polish union workers, who so clearly are anamolous in the role of protestor, and Reagan had no doubts about taking on the evil empire.  The Soviets s
