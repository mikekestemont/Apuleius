How many ways can you find to loathe yourself before 9am? Rhetorical question. And not really the point, if you can just get past yourself long enough to live, to breathe, to appreciate one tiny fraction of the world around you.
Tonight, driving home from meditation (well, meditation and ice cream, because it was the last night in the old Kadampa Buddhism space), I told E I started a blog today (I did start one earlier, but it was false and I’ve just started again), and she said, “Why?” And I said (“Because everyone else is doing it?”) … (“Because I filled the last page in my black and white composition book today so I may as well try journaling online?”) … (“Because I feel a desperate need to make a half-assed effort to connect with humanity?”) … “I don’t know,” I said. “Why not”?  “Hmph,” she said.   We agreed that we both felt better after meditation. E felt less frustration with home life. I felt less self-loathing. The possibility of shedding your self-centered burden of guilt for something else, I can't put my finger on it right now, was presented.  Kedreb, the monk who leads the class, talked about exchanging self with others. Not your whole personality, but the object of your intentions. Instead of self-cherishing, cherishing others to the point of meditating on their good as your object. During the meditation part, I tried to focus on the good of those around me.

Or just what I want from him?), and then everyone in Illinois – Barack Obama, and the governor, and the people downstate, and then the country, which of course led to George Bush, and I began to feel it’s interesting to see everyone in this way, and that you don’t have to approve of them to want their good. Or, it could all be nonsense, like saving up kisses from your dad when he puts you to sleep. Then we all went out for ice cream.  During ice cream, I talked with J, a
