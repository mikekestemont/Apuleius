On Monday,I had a SpongeBob moment.  Because of two wrecks on I-30, I was a few minutes later than my usual workout time.  Once again, I was debating about going.  I pulled into the parking lot, still debating.  I took a couple of steps from the jeep and stopped.  Somehow, I knew this was a crucial moment.  I could turn around, get back in my jeep, and no one would know.  (I met with Jeremy on Tuesday.)  As I was standing in the parking lot, it hit me.  My SpongeBob moment.  I realized that I had the shape of Patrick, the consistency of SpongeBob, and the attitude of Squidward.  With Squidward's nasal-twanged voice resounding in my head, "It's not going to matter, nothing you do will work," I felt myself turning around and heading back to the jeep.  Then, out of nowhere came screaming the voice of Mr.Crab, "You're not about to be a-wastin' me money!"  With a "Dah-ha-ha-ha" I pushed forward.  Opening the door of the fitness center, I grabbed a white towel and didn't have the urge to suffocate anyone.  I stepped on the treadmill, walking faster than I ever had.  Then, I went to the bike, turned up the resistance, and revved up the RPMs to 77.  My self-confidence climbed.  For once I was hearing myself say, "Way to go," rather than, "You're such a loser."  When I got to work, I actually had several people comment on my appearance.  With each comment, I would say, "You're my best friend today," which is reserved for anyone who blows sunshine up my rear-end that day.  At the rate I'm going, I'm going to have to use SPF50 on all four cheeks!
I noticed I was feeling paranoid as I was leaving today (Thursday).  I thought I was being followed.  Then, I realized it was just my butt dragging along behind me.  It was creating such deep ruts that I began looking around for any maintenance crews that could have used my help.  "Excuse me there, but could you use my butt to dig that trench for you?"  Man!    Jeremy gave me a new nickname..."Spunky."  As he was encouraging me to keep on rather than throw up he said, "Come on, Spunky!"  I really liked that.  I kept thinking about what "spunky" meant to me.  The more I thought about it, the more I really wanted to be that.  I wanted to be cheerful and determined and a fighter.  I felt stronger and stronger.  We started working with free weights, and I must have been feeling good because I didn't even have the urge to hit someone in the head with one!  I really can tell a difference since I've been working out.  I feel better about myself, more confident, and not wanting to hide as much.  Working with a personal trainer is the best thing I've done in the working-out category.  I absolutely love working with Jeremy.  He challenges me, makes it tough, focuses on what I need, and encourages me the whole way.  I just hope he doesn't f
