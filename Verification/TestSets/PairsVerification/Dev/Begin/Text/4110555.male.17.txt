Well in order to have justification to get our team together in one class, or at least under one E.D.D. teacher, we've started looking at entering other science competitions. Tomorrow I plan on getting the team together and show our proposal for some massive schedule changes, application forms and rules for the  urlLink Intel International Science and Engineering Fair , the  urlLink Siemens Westinghouse , and the  urlLink Toshiba NSTA ExploraVision  competitions. Hopefully we will be able to enter at least one of these competitions and use our contestant status as grounds to get our group together.
The second phase of the experiment was a success.  After the bottle cooled (sealed) for about an hour (till it was at room temperature), I stuck it back into the microwave.  Within 50 seconds there were small bubbles, and within 56 seconds there was a roaring boiling.  Wow... compared to the 1:24 of the standard air pressure (101 kPa), :56 is a great time.  This is especially true when you consider that there was 6 ounces of water and 26 ounces of air in the container.  In theory, the more water we have, the more substantial difference in times there will be.   I need to double check the first time (unsealed bottle in microwave).  I will do that just as soon as the bottle and water cool down.  I didn't time it specifically, but I seem to remember that I started with 3 minutes, and ended with 1:36.  I will let you know as soon as I reconduct the experiment.  Wow... I am so excited.  I can't believe this theory actually works in practice.  What is better is that the 6 ounces of water and 26 ounces of air means that the times can only get better, the fuller the machine is.  Wow...  -Ben Salinas  EDIT:  I reheated the unsealed bottle, and it was almost down to the second: 1:24!
Well, I ran into one more problem before I was able to start.  My bottle will not fit standing up in the microwave.  Since I have a narrow mouth bottle, I was able to put water in it and place it on its side in the microwave.  This only allows me to put in at most, about 8 ounces of water in the 32 ounce container.  I ended up putting 6 ounces of water in.  This will probably produce little to no change.  There will be very little (comparatively) heat gained by heating up the water.  I am noticing a definite loss of pressure in the bottle, as I am now able to squeeze the lexan bottle and have it compress.   Hmm, I hope the water will boil faster.  I should like to try this experiment with more water.  I will let you know how it ends up, once the bottle cools down.  -Ben Salinas
I recieved a reply from Nalgene (just over 12 hours after I sent my question).  They pretty much gave me the go ahead.  His actual message was:  Dear Ben Thank you for your interest in our Nalgene Brand outdoor bottles.  In r
