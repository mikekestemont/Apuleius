Oh my goodness today was so restful! It was sooo wonderful to sleep in, even though I was on my couch since I didn't feel like cleaning off my bed last night. For all that my apartment was cleaner than I've had it in a while, I had packed so frenetically that I had clothing and stuff thrown everywhere on my bed... good thing I love sleeping on my couch.  I didn't get out of my pajamas until 6:30 tonight. It was soooo wonderful to just lay on the couch and talk to friends and nap. But today was Venitian Night, and I just love the fireworks. For anyone who's not from Chicago, Venetian night has been going for over 50 years, and it has a boat parade and fireworks that all go along with a theme, and the fireworks are simply awesome. They use a lot of new fireworks, which is always exciting, and they're choreographed quite well with the music. Very fun. It was good for me to get dressed and get out of the apartment too. I think I'm going to make sure that I get out of the house every day this week... it's so great to not be stuck in a building all day!!
My goodness, it was hard for me to leave Texas!! What a crazy emotional day I've had. I slept through my alarm, almost had a heart attack when I saw what time it was, and then I saw the bill that had been slipped under my door and in my not-really-cognizant state thought it was somehow an internet bill or something... and I started to cry, cause I don't have the money to pay for that sort of thing! Fortunately a call to the front desk cleared it all up, but goodness... It just really threw me off for the whole day, so when I got to work I was about ready to burst into tears anyway.  Fortunately I did a pretty good job of not crying. Darn you, awesome people in Addison... making it hard for me to leave!!!!  The last day is always the worst too, because you're torn between wanting it to never end, and wanting to just leave already and be done with the goodbyes.  It was so great having people sad to see us go. Believe me, you guys, if I could stay longer, I would have. But now I'm back at my old store for a week, and then off to the suburbs to open another store. I don't know if I'm gonna be able to do this--start all over again! I had no idea that more draining than the physical aspect of just standing for so many hours would be the the emotional aspect. It's tough getting to know people, getting invested in them, and then leaving! So please, please keep in touch, all of you. I want to know how you're doing and what you're up to.   I've had an awesome time, and if I'm able to come back to Dallas I'll be sure t
