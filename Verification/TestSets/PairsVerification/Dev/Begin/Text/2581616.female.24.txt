and so it begins...  How exciting!  Very first post ever on this fresh little newborn blog.  Mmm..  I'm happy to be the first to taint it.  heh.
shitty saturday. hi.  it's freezin' ass cold and weather person says we may get up to 20 inches of snow over this not-so-blessed weekend.  ugh.  stuff is blah right now.  (i'm so damn eloquent)  on some stupid-ass sitcom i'd never seen in my life and that i watched for approximately 1 1/2 minutes..i heard talk of a swear jar.  (Put money in when ya swear, ya'know)  so yeah, i should do that and then take a  BIG FUCKING VACATION .   *sigh*    i'm frustrated right now.  i read  urlLink cock under lock  yesterday and it made me so sad.  it affected me all day long.  i just see dismal stuff everywhere i look lately.  things are really tough with lindsay right now..not between us but just the junk going on in his life.  love him more all the time.  work is tiring.  my cat is named sam.  and ...  i'm done whining for now.  adding some more people to the side there.  i keep stumbling upon more people that i enjoy.  be click happy.  help me see that comments are working too.   hehe.   =o))
i read  urlLink jason's blog .  you see...  i don't know jason.  i don't know  urlLink lane  either....but i've linked them.  I suppose i don't have to know people to link them....right??  anyway..  i don't even remember how i learned of the term "blog" but i did and i started discovering interesting people.  i'm not generally one to leave comments and such but i get fascinated and absorbed in what i'm reading and can't wait to hear what happens next.  heh.  i don't find myself being stalker'ish or vicariously living through others....but i was enjoying reading others' blogs and was fond of the ones i found that belong to lane and to jason.  their 'story' makes me say "awww" in the most genuine tone of syrupy sap.  what the hell is my point here?!  i swear i have one.  i'm not writing a disclaimer....nor justifying..just sort of typing an explanation.  heh.  lindsay keeps telling me to stop apologizing.  i'm working on it..    so i like dirty things.  sometimes i AM a dirty thing.  i wasn't sure what tone this blog would take...that will shift and shiver and mutate and squirm, of course....but i wanted to link people i don't know personally...just fond of their blog/s and in the end thought..  what if those people think i'm a crazy freak for linking them on this pitiful blog??  (sorry for apologizing)  heh. a few of my links are kinda dirty.... sooo jason and lane definitely fell into the category of "neat people" but i wanted to clarify that their sites are not generally of the sexual nature.   ha.  does any of this make sense?!  anyway, the sailor moon pic of jason is hot indeed and lane is adorable so if you wanna click their links...do so.  they have lots to say on varying topics a
