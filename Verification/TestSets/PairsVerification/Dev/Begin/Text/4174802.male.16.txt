I havent updated this in awhile, so here we go:  Soccer has started and so I'm more busy than usual, and I'm more tired and sore than usual, so I'm going to be earlier. But don't get me wrong, I love soccer and I'm glad that practice has started... I'm sooo pumped for this years season, I really think that we will do well, cuz we are actually working together as a team and alot of people have improved and the new kids that we have are actually decent players, plus we are in a disctrict or whatever this year and so if we win a certain amount of certain games, we can go to playoffs, which might actually happen, so I'm happy about that.  Well, that's all for now, and so once school starts i will update this daily... but until then, don't excpect this to be updated often...
Well to start things off I think i should say that the olympics start today.  And also, there is a hurricane heading or should i say that has already hit, where my grandparents live.... but at least they are safe in north carolina, cuz they have two homes... and actually, the news said that there would be tornados all along the east coast, including north carolina...  Well today i worked on my website and I'm glad to say that i have a guestbook now... my site is  urlLink www.freewebs.com/nayaka4watashi  if anyone cares :)  Tommorow I am going to ohio for a tournament that my brother is in, so i will be there tommorow and sunday.... and then on the 28th, Jon, Evan, Caleb, Seth, James, and I are going to columbus for a 4 on 4 tournament so wish us luck....  Goodnight
Well today wasnt nearly as fun as tuesday.... but oh well.  There really isnt anything to write about so here is a song by Ethos called Sky Dark Blue:  Sky Dark Blue  shining sparks falling in air satellites signal home  wish you were here instead of up there promise me never to be alone  midnight on the trampoline embers dying as they seem to dance like we used to dance on February nights  shine the flashlights on the ground sleeping on air, our hearts pound crack a smile at me, your face has never been so bright  I can’t doze when I’m next to you I lie frozen Only you  Incessant showers of cold rain Wash away all our pain This is the only moment like this I’ve had in my life  Remembering all our scrapes and cuts And all the times we spilled our guts Emotions cutting through me like The blunt edge of a knife  I can’t doze when I’m next to you I lie frozen Only you  Just promise me we’ll be best friends Although we’ve already reached the end I know that I will think of you Every time I see sky open up to blue… [Blew] it all away Never thought that I’d ask for just one more day I have to show you all t
