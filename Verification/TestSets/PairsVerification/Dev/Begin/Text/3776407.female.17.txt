GONNA TAKE MY LICENSE TEST TODAY!!! oh boy oh boy  so I made it possible for anyone to post comments in here IF THEY SO DESIRE, not just members (matt this is for you cuz you tried and couldn't) so.....make me happy and do it. Alrighty, I'm gonna go now and announce the test results when I return. Byes!  Yes, so the ppl in Anoka are mean and evil. Especially the streets. And from those two comments you may think that streets are people too....well they're not, its just that the people that made the streets in Anoka are dumb. So I decided to not pass the test today just to teach them a lesson and so that other drivers out there can have a few more days to prepare for the honor and extreme goodness(yes goodness) of having me be a fellow driver. And the person who cut me off coming home and tried to kill me.....he should be punished and made to go cry in a corner. It was scurry. SCURRY.   Sinziana
Sup sup!?! Today is Moseley's birthday, HAPPY HAPPY BIRTHDAY to him. Wow, 18...he can vote.  One more day till I get my license, EXCITING!!! Yes and only two more days (hehehe) of practice in the morning this week, cuz thursday we're going to Noah's Ark, which shall be fun indeedy. So had a near death experience today. I was sitting and eating Dorito's when all of a sudden i went to swallow one and things started going in wrong directions. Of course I just froze and got all teary eyed and stopped breathing, while thinking 'OH SHIT' and then coughed and everything was ok. Scurry.   "As soon as you step through my door i saw you for the first time all over again..."  That's all for now.....people....you are more than welcome to leave comments.
Yay for blogs!!! Finally have an FTP that works so I can post my website, however I've been told by two people now that they cannot see my site yet...GRRRR. Anton, my brother's friend, has AC/DC blasting right next to me and um...I'm not sure if I like it or not. I need a job, really really need one. Two more days and then hopefully I'll have my license and then HOPEFULLY get a car soon, so I can go out and get a silly job. Its sunny outside, so I'ma go tanning soon. But first I must post the song lyrics for today.  Godsmack "Running Blind"  Can’t find the answers I’ve been crawling on my knees Looking for anything To keep me from drowning Promises have been turned to lies Can’t even be honest inside Now I’m running backward Watching my life wave me goodbye  Running blind I’m running blind Somebody help me see I’m running blind  Searching for nothing Wondering if I’ll change I’m trying everything But everything still stays the same I thought if I showed you I could fly Wouldn’t need anyone by my side Now I’m running backward With broken wings I know I’ll die  Running blind I’m running b
