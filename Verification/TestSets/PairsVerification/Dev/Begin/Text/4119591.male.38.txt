I know, I know. This movie came out like 200 years ago, but I finally just saw it.  I had been avoiding it because I just knew I was going to dislike it or that it would be seriously weak. I liked it and it wasn't even slightly weak.  So, normally what I would do at a time like this is run out and tell all of my friends (both of them) to see  urlLink this film  right away, but I won't because I'm apparently the last person on earth to see it.  Decent flick. Go  urlLink rent  it... again.
The  urlLink news  today is a-buzz about a controversial Supreme Court ruling that struck down a Texas law against sodomy.  Texas prosecutors had argued that the state was entitled to regulate public morality and that bans on homosexual acts were a longstanding U.S. legal tradition.   Seems to me that if Texas really wants to uphold "traditional family values," it should start by cracking down on heterosexual acts outside of marriage. ...but that would ruin the lives of too many politicians, now wouldn't it?
I received an update today from the Social Security Administration. The notice listed out how much money I've made over the years and how much of that was collected from me and my employers.  At the bottom, in bold, not-so-friendly letters it read:  Your estimated benefits are based on current law. Congress has made changes to the law in the past and can do so at any time. The law governing benefit amounts may change because, by 2042, the payroll taxes collected will be enough to pay only about 73 percent of scheduled benefits.  Let's see... I'll be in my mid-to-late-seventies in 2042. Kids will be playing their darned holographs too loud and no one will give me a place to sit on the space bus. To top it off, I'll have to use the money I've been shashing away since I was 25 because the money that has been taken from me since I was 15 will be exhausted.  Am I outraged? No. One of two things will happen, I'm guessing:   The next few generations yet to be born will be asked (or told) to support us Gen-Xers.   The next few generations yet to be born will get fed up with us old codgers and make us into house pets.   I don't care either way. As long as they turn their music down.
When I first saw "the web," I was working for a hi-tech company. A co-worker of mine dropped by my cubicle all excited about this new thing he had seen. He was talking about the NSCA Mosaic HTTP browser. I don't remember what version we had running, but it was UNIX-based and displayed through Xwindows of some flavor. Stones, knives and bear skins by today's standards.  The first site I saw featured  urlLink LEGO  products. It might have been put up by the corporation or it might have been made by an enthusiast of the little plastic blocks but, whichever it was, I wasn't impressed. I t
