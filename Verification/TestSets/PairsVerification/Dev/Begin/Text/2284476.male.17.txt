I just read this message today from Sister Hazel lead singer, Ken Block:   We are pumped ya'll!! This is gonna be an amazing year - probobly the most exciting in the history of Sister Hazel....  There's our 1st DVD coming out on January 20th (We are VERY excited about this!), To top that, we have our 1st double live CD coming out on the SAME DAY with some addition and different material, a new concert tour, a new Sister Hazel CD later in the spring, the 1st annual "The Rock Slope" in Colorado (This event is gonna blow peoples mind!), our Lyrics For Life charity event '04, The Rock Boat '04 AND a holiday CD ready for next holiday season. Anyone whose been around this band knows that there will be endless fun and countless suprises along the way. We've never been more excited about what lies ahead. If you ever thought about checking out what it's like to be a Hazelnut -- Jump in and HOLD ON TIGHT!  Ken Block Sisterhazel   I can't wait for the DVD, and the new Sister Hazel CD. If you've never heard of them, you really should go to their  urlLink Website  and take a listen. They're a great band. If you like Matchbox 20 or Train, you'll almost definently like Sister Hazel.
I just don't get it some times. In a world filled with thousands upon thousands of products to make you smell good, there's always a few people that seem to have let the deodorant revolution pass them by. Do they even know that they smell about as sweet as a butt crack? I just don't get how they can smell so raunchy and not notice it. Everyone else around them can, so why the hell can they not realise that, when they're smelling the same nasty smell ALL DAY when they move around, that it's prolly not the people they pass in the hallways, and it might actually be their stinky ass? My personal belief is that there should be some law against people not wearing some form of protection. And I'm not talking about the kind of protection that is ribbed for your pleasure, I'm talking about the kind that protects all of us from your funky ass smellin' pits.
Welp, I've successfully managed in pissing off my mom to the point of her saying I should just move out. What did I do? I got lost coming home (DOT had shut down 206th street, which I usually turn on to off of 37), and when I tried reaching my dad on his nextel, got static. When I tried reaching her, I didn't get any response at all. When I finally found my way home, I asked her why she didn't have her cell phone turned on, and she got pissed because I was home late (well no shit, I was lost einstein) and because I "had an attitude" again. Whatever. I'm honestly getting so sick of my parents that it's not even funny.
Grrr. Some the way customers are treated just really m
