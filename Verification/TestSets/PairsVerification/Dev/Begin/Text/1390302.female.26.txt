"Adulthood"   WritersDigest.com prompt for 12/20/2003 - Written on 01/25/04:  At what point in your life did you realize you were finally an adult? Write a journal entry about it.  It would be easy to say that I realized I was an adult when I graduated High School or turned eighteen, though it would be a lie.  As I look back and consider the events of my life thus far, I would say that I realized I was an adult not when I married for the first time but when I divorced.  Divorce is something that marks you, something you remember for the whole of your life.    When I was a sophomore in high school I started dating Mike, it was August 94.  He was a good guy, and we really enjoyed one another company.  We had a good time together, he started living with my family -his parents were divorced.  We spent a good deal of time together, which eventually lead to our first big fight in December 94, only four months after we started dating.  This of course led to years of fighting, nearly non-stop.  We had several good years together, got engaged in February 96, graduated high school in May 96, and began to plan our wedding.

I didn't want to buy a house, Mike did.  I wanted to rent an apartment, he said no.  So we bought a house in December 98 and moved in around Christmas time. The fighting did not even come close to stopping.  Immature as I was, immature as he was, the fighting went on.  Many late night fights later I told him that if something didn't change I was leaving by June, it was January 97.  Nothing changed and I met someone new.  No, I didn't leave Mike for Matt; I left Mike for my sanity and piece of mind.  Matt was there for me and we forged a bond.  Mike had caused me years of therapy for problems that he caused me to have, I just couldn't take it anymore.  Mike and I divorced in June of 99, 11 months after our wedding, one month shy of our first anniversary.  It was a fight from the world "divorce."  He refused to let me go and I refused to allow him to make me stay.  Two weeks of pain ensued and when i
