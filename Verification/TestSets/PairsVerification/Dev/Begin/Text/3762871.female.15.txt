There is only one more day until I can see Danny again... I am realy happy about that I cant wait. Then today we are picking up Caity sometime so I am excited about that. Yesturday I visited Brandie, Aj, and John. I was bord so skate boarded around. I need to finish cleaning my room today so Caity can sleep in my room lol. I dont realy have much else to do that I know of. I should go out and tan or something. Cause my legs are sooo white... but I guess they will get tan at the beach. We are leaving for the beach on Friday. I kinda wish that I was gonna b here Friday night cause Danny is going to the movies and Bobbie and Aj are going too. Well I dont know what else to say so ill start to get ready its not even 9 yet.. oh yeah and if u noticed that clock thingy is wrong like off by a few hours its realy like 8:45...

But I need something to do tomorrow to keep myself busy. Caity is comming to visit Wednesday then we are going to the beach I will have to introduce her to all my friends and Danny. I still need to have Danny meet my family. So Wednesday I will be busy but tomorrow I dont know what I will do yet I hope the weather isnt bad but it probably will be. I wanna try to get some pictures on here but I dont know how I could try to figure it out...
Here's some poems that I have wrote when I was going through my heart break with Aj and ones that I have wrote lately...   So Alone  I never felt this way around you its like I am alone but u are there I liked when u looked in my eyes but now you look elsewhere  I loved the old times we had the time u use to spend with me you say you don't have time but I'm not blind I can see your feelings for me have changed but I still like you the same I wish we would be like before remmber when I seen u and u was glad I came r them times gone forever or will we be together again some day I wish you c
