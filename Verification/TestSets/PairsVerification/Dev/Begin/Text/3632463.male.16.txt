Here's how my past two days went. On the same night that I got sick, Crys and I got into a misunderstanding and we both lost sleep over it. Anyway, yesterday, I decided that I wanted to surprise her, so I did with a dozen roses. Seeing her smile yesterday definitely made my week. We wanted to see if they could come over for a while, but Krissy's brother was being a tard, so she got mad and decided not to go. Because Krissy backed out, Crys did too. After that we came home and were all bummed out for a while, I was a bit pissed at first but then I talked to Crys on the phone so my little frown was turned upsidown. Manzie and I were sent to pick up Deryl a little later, and when we got home, we had a huge surprise... they were here! They ended up spending the night, which I am glad they got to. Crys also bought me a stuffed cat, a card, and a balloon, which I thought was really nice of her. The contents of the card brought me to tears I have to admit. Went to work for the first time this week. I won't be bringing home much this week. Oh well, I only have two things I need to get; a phone for my room and two t-shirts for Seth. I have a feeling I may get him another article of clothing instead though, something he actually needs, like pants. That's aboot it.  Mood: Happy as I can be!!! :-D Currently Playing: Anthrax - Got the Time
The party last night was great, as was Crystal's graduation. Speaking of which, have I mentioned how extremely proud of her I am? Well, I am. After adding Crys to our car we picked up Krissy and went to Rent-a-Center. Walter took forever as usual. After that we went to my house for a bit, where we met up with Manzie. As for the party... got to see a lot of old faces, and Crys got to meet more of my family. Uncle Mark didn't even recognize me, and Barb said I used to be a fat boy, which I took a little offense to, but she had a point. My grandma had to go to the hospital though, she was doing better today, thank God. I ran faster snd hsrder than I had ever thought I could when I heard about that. Too bad I'm not in school anymore, I could've done track... inside joke, if you don't know, don't ask. Krissy left us after a while, which sucked, but she didn't want to feel all third wheelish... I think if she had stayed she would've had a lot of fun with everyone and we would've been there all night. Crys' ears started acting up so we sat in the shed during fireworks. I didn't mind missing them for her. There was a stray one this year that shot into the woods. After that, we had some fun talking t
