"...quite simply one of the most original poetry-themed shows I've ever seen."  --Taylor Mali    "If you are of the opinion that the contemplation of suicide is sufficient evidence of a poetic nature, do not forget that actions speak louder than words."  --Fran Lebowitz     Saturday April 3 @ 8pm SHARP!
