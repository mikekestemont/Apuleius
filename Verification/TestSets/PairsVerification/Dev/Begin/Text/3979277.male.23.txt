Why does everyone seem to hate staff meetings at work?  Our team meets once a month to discuss various problems/questions people have brought up and everyone always complains about going. Why? I personally love getting paid for an hour to do absolutely nothing!  I usually just sit there and let my mind wander, while everyone else engages in a fascinating debate about why we have to do use a particular colour of paper or something else exciting. I 'm hoping one day to find a job that is simply 8 hours a day of meetings, then I wouldn't have to do any work for my wages!
I was bored yesterday night so I decided to try to make the famed  Elvis Sandwich !  For those of you who have never heard of it here's the  urlLink recipe      Elvis Sandwich       2 slices of white bread 2 tablespoons of smooth peanut butter 1 small ripe banana mashed 2 tablespoons butter       Spread the peanut butter on one slice of bread and the mashed banana on the other. Press the slices gently together. Melt the butter (or to be truly Elvis-like, melt bacon fat!), over low heat in a small frying pan. Place the sandwich in the pan and fry until golden brown on both sides      I decided to be a bit more healthy than Elvis, so instead of frying the sandwich, I toasted it instead!   It was very nice but strangely no-one else was willing to try it!  Apparently Elvis used to eat 12 to 16 of these sandwiches a day, but I just stuck with 2 as I don't want to end up looking like fat Elvis!
Yep it's that time again! Time to spend every waking hour of the day watching as much sport as possible, no matter how obscure it is!  Not had time to watch much yet, but did enjoy the Puerto Rico/USA men's basketball match last night. Even the incredible bias of the BBC's commentator could spoil it for me. Honestly I think this guy must have had some money bet that Puerto Rico would win or he was just a total hater of the Americans, but he could barely contain his joy when Puerto Rico scored.  Some nice play by Iverson and Duncan, but they just weren't good enough to beat Puerto Rico. Anyone writing off the USA is mistaken as I think they'll still take gold.   urlLink Match Report     I'm stuck working until 9pm this week at work so I'll miss most of the action, but I'm sure I'll find time to catch up!
Been offline for the past few days so I haven't had the chance to read up much on the hurricane that hit Florida.  From the coverage on  urlLink Fox News  it seems pretty devastating, but thankfully the worst of the storm missed Tampa. It was initially estimated that it would hit the city head-on, which would have lead to most of downtown being flooded. Somehow the city escaped again as it's been 80 years since it was last hit.
