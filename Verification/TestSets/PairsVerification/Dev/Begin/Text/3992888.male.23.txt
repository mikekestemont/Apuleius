This is only a test run to make sure that everything is working correctly.&nbsp; Hopefull more to come soon.
We got cell phones. That was our smallest purchase of the weekend at 1 yen (with a year long contract). Needless to say, they are pretty neat and will serve their purposes in case anything happens to us on the road in a foreign country where we don't know what to say in the middle of nowhere. (It's really not that scary.) By the way, moshi moshi means hello (I think only when you answer cell phones).  Friday after work, Cristina came over and picked me up. I drove in her car under her supervision to make sure that I would know how to drive manual on a mountain with curvy roads. It turns out I do, so I am not as frightened as I was beforehand. That night we went to Kanoya city, the nearby not so city-like or very pretty place, but it is more urban which is kinda nice. We went out with some other JET participants. It was about 8 of us in total. We found that many places were full because this weekend is Obon, a holiday when people go back home to visit their families and remember their ancestors. Finally we found a place and ate. It was all you can eat and drink but I wasnt really that hungry or in the mood to drink (especially after Tokyo -- haven't told you guys about that one). After we ate, we went to a Karaoke Bar. It was not the karaoke booths type of place.  It was actually like a lounge and you told the bar tender the song number and then when your song comes up you get passed a portable microphone.  I did not feel like singing too much although I did do backup vocals to I forget which song.  There were probably about 50 people there, and we probably monopolized the mics most of the night.  The bathroom there was very odd.  At first you open the door and you are in a dark closet that is wallpapered in a dark pattern.  If it weren't for the door knob to the actual bathroom you would think you were in this dark little closet.  Then when you go into the toilet room, there was this apparently famous poster of obscene and lude acts that 1 or 2 people can do in a bathroom stall.  We were at this bar till about 4 a.m. and proceeded to go home.  Two of our friends that were drinking were going to get this special kind of cab that comes with 2 drivers -- one drives the cab and the other drives your car.  (Isnt that neat, they should have this in the States.)  However, since Cristina and I were not drinking we just did it instead.  I felt really comfortable driving the manual car again.  We dropped them off in Kushira and continued to Cristina's house in Higashi-Kushira.  We w
