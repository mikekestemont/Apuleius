The Big Day has arrived  Tomorrow, our little family is being scattered to the four corners of the earth as M heads for NY with her sister to see her ex sister in law, while the boy and I are catching an early flight from Exeter to Malaga. M has a place to stay and has bought tickets for a "Show"while we have no accomodation or onward transport booked at all. On arrival in Malaga, we will head for the port and book a ferry to Melilla in Spanish north Africa. Then we'll stay the night there. The next day we plan to catch a bus to the border and then make our way to the nearby city of Nador. We will then catch a bus, if possible, to Fes. If we can hire a car there even better as it makes us independent. Once in Fes we will head south to the Middle Atlas where Barbary Apes (I told him we could go to Gibraltar for them, but apparently they weren't exotic enough) apparently await us plus the edge of the Sahara. A car will be hired from Fes if need be. There is a geocache on the way south so that will be a nice distraction. A second night in Fes will then precede, hopefully, the trip in the return direction. I suspect it is cramming too much into a short period. Obvious worries are lack of transport to/from Fes at times that arrive at the destination at a reasonable hour. The only schedule I have found would have us arrive in Fes at 2am, not a pleasant prospect with no hotel booked. Also there is some doubt about return boats from Melilla to Malaga: if they dont return on Sundays for the Monday am flight we are screwed. Our last trip away together, 2 years ago, from Helsinki to Devon by public transport, resulted in a similar rushed trip, from Helsinki to Talinn, Riga, Vilnius, Warsaw, Prague, Munich and Luxembourg, by bus and train. Maybe it's him, maybe it's me. I blame the boy. His new Dell PC arrived today. The contents of his desktop are all over the floor, while the PC has pride of place. One day he will clear up. The 4th member of our family, H, is staying here in town and will come up to feed the cats while we are away. She left (eventually) a year ago (oh what grief she caused) when her baby girl came along. She's happy in her flat with her man, but every now and then she needs the space and comes to stay up here. I wont be doing this for a few days. I'll report back. A
Geo cache failure plus self-hypnosis  Party last night in the big city. Well, Exeter, which to us in the sticks IS the big city. We took the MG which I was allowed to drive at alarming speed (telltale sign of alarmingness being the gritted teeth and white knuckles from M in the passenger seat). Fine birthday evening in p
