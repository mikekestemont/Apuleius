Ninja. The antithesis of all that is decent, the sneaky sneaky ninja does nothing but mince around picking fights with children in McDonalds.  In a fight with a real pirate you're most likely to run for your mummy after being bitchslapped halfway around the world.  Oh, and you probably can't even swim.    urlLink   How much of a pirate are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

wow...i stayed at a friends house last night...it was crazy man i mean her mom woke us all up at like 7 in the morning crying and screaming at my friend bobby because supposedly he put a dent on the right side of her car...which he didnt do...so she was yelling at all o us and crying uncontrollably. You couldnt even see the dent...anyways yeh it was pretty crazy...I keep telling my friend that she should move out of there because her mom is really abusive...not really physically but mentally. Her mom is always calling her names and everything and kicking her out. Shes going to go make her stay with her drug addicted biological mom and abusive biological father. Its pretty fucked up....yeh thats all i had to say i guess...maybe more later
