Yesterday after having left a post I actually did start packing.  I got two boxes done and then got called into work.  When I got there I picked up one patient.  He had just had a heart attack, got two stents and I was going to pull out the catheter from his artery (we do this a lot).  I was thinking ok, this won't be such a bad day.  Well then I picked up a second patient...he was very hard of hearing and very confused.  To make a long story really short...it ended up being a really frustrating day.  But it ended well...I got to go home early.  So yes indeed I not only went in late, but I got to leave early.  So you are probably thinking that I got a lot of packing done when I got home early.  Nope, none.  Today is a day off for me and I have big plans to pack.  I will let you know how that goes.  Did I ever mention that I truly HATE packing. On another note.  I went to my brother-in-laws house this morning.  I had the pleasure of giving him the news that his ex-girlfriend (of 4 months) whom he dated for nearly 8 years is now engaged and planning a wedding for May.  Unbelieveable...yes.  And I felt absolutley horrible giving him this news.  But he knows that I am still friends with her and if he heard it through the grape vine I know that he would wonder why I hadn't told him.  My point is that I now feel like shit because he probably feels like shit.   I must move away from the computer now and do something that will help with our move out of this place.
Although today is one of my regularly scheduled days at the hospital I am on call.  They are probably over staffed or don't have enough patients in the unit.  This all works well for me.  Usually on an on call day it goes like this...the alarm goes off at 5:15 a.m, I hit snooze until 5:45 a.m.  Somewhere between 5:30 and 6 a.m someone from the scheduling office at work calls and asks would I like to be put on-call for the day.  I usually ask if they will just cancel me, they say no and then I say ok o being on-call.  Usually I then go right back to bed and sleep for a few  more hours, then spend the rest of my day watching some good tv.  However, today did not happen that way.  Everything was just as it should be up until the going back to bed part.  Seeing as how we have to be out of this townhouse by Sunday and nothing is packed I couldn't justify going back to bed.  Actually on the way back to the bed I caught a glimpse of the empty packing boxes and guilt filled my brain.   Now it is 7:50a.m and I still haven't packed anything.  I ate breakfast, checked the email, surfered around for awhile and now a
