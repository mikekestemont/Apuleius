Good evening.  So I'm sitting here, and I'm thinking "Gee, I oughta do something."  Sure, I could just go to sleep... it's almost midnight, and I do have to work tomorrow.  But I'm feeling, for the moment, a bit unfulfilled.  No telling whether typing to no one (and I'm not yet sure if it's no one in particular, or actually no one at all) will punch that ticket tonight or not.  And it's not like there's not plenty I COULD do.  Had a cookout at my place yesterday and the downstairs could use some picking up.  I have a web site or two I need to update.  But that doesn't have the same allure as this.  Of course, if anyone's ever going to read this, I have to be a bit more interesting, don't I?  OK, what do I have?  Funny story.  Starts in high school.  Dated a girl.  Kept up with that through the first couple years of college, even though it was long distance.  Serious thing.  We thought it was a lot more serious than it was -- we were 17, 18, 19, 20, 21... whaddya really know then?  She more than me, apparently, because for the last year or so that we were still "together" (if not geographically then telephonically -- this is before email was available to 99.9% of the country), she was seeing this guy.  This guy, with whom she later moved to the midwest and married, that is.  She and I -- Audrey, her name is Audrey -- exchanged letters a few years ago, and that was the only contact we had in 12 years.  Which was ok with me.  Then, out of the blue, I get an email forwarded from a guy who ran a web site I once wrote an article for.  (Wow, how many misplaced prepositions in THAT sentence?)  The email asked me to call her or email her with my #.  Why?  Sort of cryptic, but something about owing me an apology.  Now, these things don't happen spontaneously.  I gave her my #, she was going to call me that evening.  Hadn't a clue what to expect, and I was a wreck all day... couldn't concentrate on anything, was more or less useless at the office.  Talked to my two friends who knew her to settle me down.  Didn't work.  A couple vodka and cranberries (with a splash of lime juice, each) did.  Then the phone rang.  Audrey sounds exactly as she did 12 or 13 years ago.  For that matter, the same as she did when we first met, in high school, almost 20 years ago.  Except troubled.  Which, admittedly, she sounded like the last year I knew her... but I was too dumb or in love or something to notice and wonder why.  So she wants to apologize for lying to me, cheating on me, breaking up with me and running off with this other guy (with whom she now has two kids) because -- this is the good part -- her husband is having some sort of t
