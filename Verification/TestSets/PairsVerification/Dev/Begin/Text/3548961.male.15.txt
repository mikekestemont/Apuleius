well, i haven't wrote in 3 whole days, feels like an eternity don't it? how did you poor people get along without the devine daily story of my life? Well, i didn't have much to talk about, i actually don't think i did anything either of those days so you didn't miss much so heres the story of my day today since it was fun filled and exciting. i awoke and came down and got on my laptop as i usualy do, i talked for a while, nothing significant but it sustained my attention for a while. i played soccer today after brian woke up with him obviously and steve. it was good times, and incidently im getting good at pks. i can win contests almost every time so yay for me. after that i came back to my house and i had one of the most horifying food experiences ever. seriously. i was eating grapes and there was something on my finger so i looked down. it was a spider so flicked it off and looked at the grapes, there was spider nest in the grapes. I freaked out, oh man, i ran to the sink and gagged myself until i ralphed, twice. it wasn't cool.  I go to california on saturday, i know you'll miss me teribly and all but don't you cry, i'll be back in two weeks and then i'll come surfin back singin the beach boys with a tubular tan and a bodacious babe. good stuff eh? well uh, thats it, tell me if you want me to send you a california post card or anything of the sort.  love always, -alex
