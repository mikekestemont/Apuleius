urlLink Modern Disciple Magazine - June / July 2004 - Duvall    The attached is an interview with Josh Caterer, lead singer of a great band named Duvall. If you haven't heard Duvall before, you can hear one of their songs at  urlLink Asian Man Records . Caterer was the lead singer and creative force behind The Smoking Popes, which was another very cool band. In the late '90s, Caterer was found by God, and (as he says in this interview) he realized that he couldn't be a musician in exactly the same way he was before. That began a process of searching out how to be faithful to his Lord, and the vocation his Lord had given him. From what I'm seeing and hearing, he's doing that pretty nicely.   Anyway, this interview has some really interesting thoughts from Josh Caterer on being a Christian and understanding how to live out your vocation in the world.
Dr. Donald Bloesch has just completed his seven-volume systematic theology, titled  urlLink Christian Foundations . This afternoon I completed the fourth volume,  Jesus Christ: Savior and Lord . It is a highly recommended read (as were the first three volumes). Particularly striking to me was the book's final paragraph. It serves to wrap up his thoughts on the exclusivity of Christ as the only way of salvation, but it also summarizes the entire volume. More to the point, though, it is a great expression of what the work of the church is in this foreign world:    In its witness the church should not press for a return to a monolithic society in which church and state work together to ensure a Christian civilization, for such an undertaking would only draw the church away from its redemptive message and blur the lines between church and world. Neither should the church withdraw from society and cultivate little bastions of righteousness that strive to preserve the ethical and religious values handed down from the past. Instead, the church should witness to the truth of the gospel in the very midst of society in the hope and expectation that this truth will work as the leaven that turns society toward a higher degree of justice and freedom. The church cannot build the kingdom of righteousness, but it can serve this kingdom by reminding the world that there is a transcendent order that stands in judgment over every worldly achievement and that the proper attitude of leaders of nations is one of humility before a holy God and caring concern for the disinherited and the oppressed.    That is the pilgrim life I'm after. Not only could I not have said it better, I clearly could not have said it that well. Thanks be to God that Dr. Bloesch could.
