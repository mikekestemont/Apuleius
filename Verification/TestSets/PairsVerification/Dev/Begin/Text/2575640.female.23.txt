So this is my first ever blog and I am pretty excited.  I just got home from work at the museum and I will be going to the bar (to work) in a little bit.  Kind of a long day for New Year's Eve but I guess that's just the way it goes.  John found out he doesn't have to work tomorrow which is great because my friends Annie and Sean will be here tonight and tomorrow.   So we're getting married!  I am so excited and happy I hardly know what to do with myself.  I have been no good at concentrating on anything else, which is good in a way since there is so little time to get all the details straight.

We are going to taste cakes on the 19th and I have the bridal shower on the 24th and everything is seems to be coming together so nicely! Hopefully we will have everything done or at least set out by the end of the month and then I wont have anything to worry about until after we get married.  Which of course would be wonderful.    John has had some excitement himself the last few days.  On Sunday he was at the Sidebar putting in a new PA system and a water main broke and flooded the street so he had to wade through and move the car (thank god it started in a foot of water!) so he was soaking wet and cold by the time he got home.  Then he went to work on Monday and a building near his shop was on fire with trucks blocking the little street so he couldn't leave until after they were done putting that out.  So I told him that if today there was a tornado or e
