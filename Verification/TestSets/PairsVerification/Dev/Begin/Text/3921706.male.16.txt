Since i've opened a new blog here at   urlLink  blogger.com   , I know I'll update much more often than I did with LJ, even though my life is pretty boring. But my summer, at least the weekends, seem to be pretty full. Nothing planned for tomorrow yet but Sunday, I'm attending a BBQ. Then next Saturday, I'm supposed to go to a friend's graduation party even tho none of my friends, nor I, really want to go. Not because we don't necessarily like the person giving it but because we can smell the boredom from a mile away. Then I'm going to go see I, Robot that Sunday. And then the week after that is our annual congregation picnic and 2 days later, I finally leave for 2 weeks in good ol' Texas!! I don't know why but I'm not excited as one would think. I'm eager to go but the anticipation has died down and I don't think I'll really be antsy until the day before we depart. See? Told you my life was boring but interesting things do happen from time to time.      &nbsp;   Not much else to say except I think the relationship between my mother &amp; I will probably be slightly fractured for the rest of our lives. We just can't seem to see eye-to-eye on much these days and we have our peaceable moments but I don't ever think we'll be the best of friends. Don't get me wrong, I love my mother with ALL my heart &amp; soul and would do anything for her but...I just don't ever see us being as close as a mother and son would/should be. I describe it best as this, she's good to me and bad for me. She's like watermelon seeds. My life is the watermelon. The seeds (my mom) are beneficial because without them, the watermelon (my life) wouldn't exist. At the same time, they're an inconvenience. In order to really enjoy the watermelon, you have to get rid of the seeds. So in order for me to get a full enjoyment out of life, I have to live my life separate from my mother.      &nbsp;  I know I'm not a perfect angel and I've haven't exactly always made my mother proud but I've gotten to a point where I think I'll never make her be as proud of me as she is of my other siblings. She's constantly comparing me to my sisters and brothers and reminding me that they didn't act like I do when they were my age. They set a near-perfect standard for me to live up to and i seem to be constantly failing and at this point don't care. I am not my brothers and sisters, I am me and if my mother can't love me and accept me for me, then that's her problem. Who knows, maybe one day I'll make her extremely proud of me and she'll finally accept me as me but I'm not gonna break my back to do it. I love my mother 150% and a
