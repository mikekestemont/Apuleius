School is always an interesting experience, today was no exception. We got to paint again in religion class today (I feel like i'm back in kindergarten), and Mr. O'Brien (the religion teacher) is still blaming me for the VCR that he broke. It was actually kind of funny how he broke it, he tried to pull the T.V. cart over to watch the movie and accidentally tipped it and sent the VCR crashing to the floor, breaking the faceplate on it. And auto shop was a blast today too. Rodney brought in this push go-cart for his I.S. and, of course, Jason and I took it for a test drive. Man! that thing is awsome! It's got two wheels in the front and one in the back that steers. We pushed it full tilt across the parking lot and man does that thing ever corner sharp! You turn the wheel just a bit and you bring it up on to two wheels! Math class was a blast too. Of course, it always is (I won't go into detail about that). But the highlight of the day was definitley civics class. We had a sub today, so we played tic, tac, toe and SOS all class. Amanda raped us both at it. then she started to write things on my arm. Man, she broke up with her man on thursday, i'm thinking about making a move on her...  WILL COLTON EVER ASK AMANDA OUT? WILL RODNEY EVER LET THEM USE HIS GO-CART AGAIN? TUNE IN NEXT TIME AND SEE!
It was crazy, today we (me, mike wheeler, and travis ferguson) went nuts today with travis' car! First, a descrption of his car. He drives an old, beat-up buik skylark that he's preping to run n the enduro race. It has only one seat (others ripped out for racing)it's very loud, and has no windows. the three of us rode around in the field with Mike stuffed in the trunk, then we started running into stuff (with mike still in the trunk. then Mike and i rode on the roof and hanging out the window while driving down the road. that was fun. then we chased Mike around with the car while he threw stuff at us. Then i tried driving standard for the first time, i stalled it once, then i got the hang of it. ha, ha, good times, good times...
WOOT!  MY FIRST POST! I'd like to thank my mom, dad, and all of my friends for making this possible.(just kidding) As you can see, my mind is very unique and different SO TUNE IN DAILY AS WE DELVE INTO THE SICK TWISTED THING THAT IS MY MIND!!!
I've had a shitty week so far. Kev,I have nothing to say to you here, read the e-mail. (That can give the rest of you guys a hint that something happened). But I'm not gonna dwell on that incident. I went to kev's the other day, tried Battle Engine Aquila, pretty good game, I just don't share the same enthusiasm as Kev on the g
