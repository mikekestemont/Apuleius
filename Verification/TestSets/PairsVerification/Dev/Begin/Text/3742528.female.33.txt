Sylvester Stallone, Tom Cruise, and Ellen DeGeneres all carried the Olympic torch this year.  Jennifer Aniston too.  Apparently, these people represent everything the Olympics stand for.   The Relay selection committee looked for the "best in humanity,"  and this is who they came up with.  Hmmm.  OK, so these might actually make some contributions to society, but, come on, do they contribute more than other people?  To the extent that they deserve to carry the OLYMPIC TORCH?  These aren't athletes we're talking about.  They're actors.  What do actors have to do with sports?  I don't remember a lot of people in high school who were in theater and played a sport.  Why didn't we just give an Oscar to Michael Johnson this year for God's sake?  I would so much rather see ANY athlete carry that torch.  High school students, Special Olympians, snowboarders, even people who invented some of the newer alternative sports, I mean, I hate the damn Lakers, but I'd rather see one of them carrying the damn torch.  Sly Stallone said according to the AP that it was the best experience of his life.  He's already had a pretty damn sweet life.  Probably got a bunch of houses throughout the world, and a garage full of cars bigger than my house.  Jeez, don't we give these fucking celebrities enough?  I mean they already make more money in a minute than I do in a year.  On top of that they have limos, whatever cars they want, private jets, they don't have to save up money to go out to dinner or to Paris, and they get treated like Kings.  Gifts just because they're famous.  I had to spend hours inputting numbers on Coke caps just to win a bicycle.  And now these so-deserving people get to carry the torch too.    I read somewhere that in '96, people could pay $3,000 for the priviledge of carrying the torch.  So, if you can come up with more than my piece of shit car cost me, you could carry the torch.  Well, if you're Tom Cruise or Ellen DeGeneres, you can.    So, I think I've figured it out.  All of those celebs are probably S*c*i*e*n*t*o*l*o*g*i*s*t*s.  The Church of S*c*i*e*n*t*o*l*o*g*y is probably paying off the Olympic Torch Selection Committee.  Not that I don't like S*c*i*e*n*t*o*l*o*g*i*s*t*s, they're probably really nice people, I just can think of no other explanation.  Is L. R*o*n H*u*b*b*a*r*d on the fucking selection committee?
Three weeks ago, I decided to finally see Eternal Sunshine.  I liked the movie, but was disturbed by the whole theater experience.  You see, I’m from a small town in Polk County, Florida.  OK, OK, the town of Bartow, right in the middle of the bustling metropolises of Lakeland and Winter Haven.  Actually, Bartow is the county seat.  (Locals somehow squeeze almost 3 syllables out of this name, and call it “Bart-touw.”) Rumor has it that those other 2 HUGE towns were fighting over which one would hold this fabulous honor, and when neither side would give, our Bartow was given this illustrious title.    Yeah, I’ve t
