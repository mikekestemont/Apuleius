be selfish. only think of self and own interests. get out. EVERYTHING new.
why do i question. why do i want to know why i exist? i torment myself with questions and what if's all the time. i really should be sedated and locked inside a padded room for my protection as well as yours.   i am fake. i have so many sides of me that most people only know me by that one side i've chosen to show them. i can be that very nice person that works really hard, listens, cares, and really interested in change and doing something right. other times, i'd can be that whore, an alcoholic, the girl that will not hesitate to stab you to death, and a&nbsp;selfish bitch.&nbsp;its really hard to keep myself between my urdges to be good and my urdges just to f*k everything to hell.  i don' t see myself with degrees, community service awards, a role model, a person with a big, bright future in front of her as much as i see myself as a&nbsp;whore on sunset with a drug i.v. in my arm, sniffing cocaine with a bottle of Jack. its sad but i'd much rather just not care about what other people expect of me. i am tired of "pretending" to be someone i am not.   i have "baggage." i don't trust anyone. i never get close to anyone because i know they will go away, even my family.&nbsp;i am very angry. i have been to a dark place. i have been at the edge of cliff and i have jumped. i am often disappointed in myself. i have one wish and it hasn't come true yet. i hate waiting.   there was once a time when i tried to vent my emotions only to hurt my mom with my words. it took me nearly a decade to write again.&nbsp;i believe anything that is written or typed is meant to be read and not hidden away. for years i kept my thoughts to myself only to know that i am strange and a bit scary for 'normal' people. i have thoughts no other people think or express openly. i know when to be quiet and keep my thoughts to myself because they do frighten others.  i know people aren't happy all the time, i know everybody's life, even though how sweet on the outside it may seem, may not be. i know i have had great luck with family, friends, and achievements but no matter what, i am never satisified. i will always feel i am behind. after years of thinking of the roots of my mental illness, i have come to two conclusions. one is the whole abandonment issue and the other i realized once with some help of a stranger but i don' t try not to think about; i will never admit what it is to another person. i am a girl with issues.  sometimes i am ambitious. i will take the leadership role and improve it 500% over. i will take and make new. i
