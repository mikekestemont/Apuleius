So this past week has been a little weird, full of different emotions and feelings, and I guess it's pretty impossible to sum them all up into one entry, so I'll just stick with the big stuff. On Saturday, I invited Christina to the play and to spend the night at my house. She and Olivia and Nathan and myself, all went to the play, which kind of turned into a bit of a disaster. First, Olivia, as usual acted up like a tard, and made the whole situation stressful. Second, Nathan invited one of his other friends along, who Christina doesn't particularly like. At first I thought she was just being silly, but after I met Brittany, I began to think that I was feeling the same way as Christina. She seemed sort of snobby, and not some one I would really want to talk to that much. Then during the play, this whole tention feeling was going on, which made me angry, and in turn ruined the whole play for me. When we got home, I was complaining about it, because I hate it when Christina just sits there and gets angry, and sometimes takes it out on me by calling me stupid or something, and I was taking it out on Olivia, and then Christina came over to spend the night, and there was still some tention. So I told Christina right out, and it bugged me that she would just let Nathan anger her like that. We got to talking, and I actually told her how I felt. I even let her read last Wednesday's entry, we almost started to cry, but kept it down to a soft roar. It was a good night. Then on Sunday, Mom adressed Olivia and I about everything that's been happening between us in the last month, and how our arguing is really getting on her nerves. That was a good day, because even though we had some arguments, and were crying, we got out a lot of stuff that had been bothering us, and it was helpful. I think that Richard is moving out of my math class, and I'm so sad about it. I don't want him too, even though it only reminds me of the things I can't have, I like looking at him, and thinking about what it would be like to have a boyfriend like that. He's really cute and really intellegent, and oh, I just want him to like me as much as I like him. I mean, just because I'm fat, does not mean that I don't have a good heart and mind. I just want some one to like me, and if it were some one that I liked back, it would be a plus. I mean, I don't want a huge relationship, I just want to know that I'm good enough for some one to like me the way I feel about some people, like I do Richard. I also like Chase a little. But, not as much as Richard, and I
