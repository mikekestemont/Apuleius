i was driving past the airport today and i saw a plane taking off. except i wasn't really looking at the plane. i was distracted by the insanely large amount of brown haze trailing behind the plane. i wonder how many cars worth of smog every plane produces at takeoff. maybe a better measure would be how many la la landians cough up a piece of lung for each departure.   so of course, i thought about that whole thing for a while, and after i ran some errands i went to in-n-out for a 3x3 protein and stuck around for about an hour watching the planes land. i love it when the 747's come in. the rumble coming out of those engines could strip the paint off your car. especially at the proximity i was at. i swear to god i could have gotten on top of one of the tables, jumped, and grabbed onto the wing of a passing airbus.   but after living by the airport for so long, i never notice that awe-inducing tremor anymore. i've been so desensitized to it. hmm... i feel a cheesy truth-revealing metaphor coming up, so i'll stop now.   ---Goei---
i might as well change the title of this thing to  Insomniacs Anonymous .  ---Goei---
it's days like today that make me wish that nothing else matters other than a ludicrously hot shower right before drifting off into dreamland.  that everything melts away and washes down the drain into indifferent oblivion.  of course that isn't the case; it's never that easy.  but i certainly wish it were.  is this all that life is?  reciprocating moods?  cuz that would defintely suck.  the only kind of new experiences would be in seeing what type of bad/good mood would come next.  that idea kinda fits in with my whole idea that life is built on cycles.  cycles like life and de.ath, the seasons, day and night.  i guess life is just built like that.  but how boring could  that  get?  i can see how there can be some differences that alter each experience, and how we can take part in only one revolution of some cycles, but i would hate to go on being conscious that all good moods will just lead to eventual depression and vice versa.  it's just another one of life's routines.  i'm starting to get an unwanted feeling out of living here, which isn't a good thing cuz i've still got over a year before i get the chance to leave.  it feels like the scales are unbalanced and that maybe it's futile to try to tip them back the other way.  maybe i'd be better off going somewhere else and starting completely over.  without any past inhibitions to anchor me down.  i could reinvent myself.  maybe it's just the whole teen-angst dealy again.  either way, i need to find somewhere to head other than downwards into the drain of indifferent oblivion.  ---Goei---
