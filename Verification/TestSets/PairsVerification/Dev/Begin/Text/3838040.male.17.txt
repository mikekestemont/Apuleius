The  aphorism  “Qualities reveal your soul and mind to the world”, though being forged by me, suits every step of every man’s life. It’s  quality  but not quantity that matters.  For every step one takes or for every action one does, one needs a quality plan and master - mind execution.  He/She may posses a huge amount of wealth, but he/she is said to be wise and rightly characterized, only if he fosters in him, good qualities. The quality of life one leads (or ‘lives’, may be) depends on the quality of his/her thoughts.  If thoughts are good, then he’ll attain fruition and vice versa.  urlLink  James Allen   has stressed, in his famous book,  urlLink  As a man thinketh   (rechristened for simplicity, as “As you think”) that :   A dishonest person is not totally corrupt and the honest one is not entirely virtuous.  I go with him. A dishonest person might have many other good qualities. But this one, single bad quality makes him squalid. So, bad qualities buffet you down very much. So, try coveting more good qualities than bad ones. So, quality speaks much of one’s real way of life, than quantity. Quality excels quantity. One must be qualified enough in the league stage to advance into the super league stage of life. In order to make progress in life, you need good qualities and wise actions rather than showing vice. Good thoughts can provide you a helping hand in  shaping  good qualities. (I know I am  iterating  this statement). One must shirk deceptive attitude and proceed with an  unerring  mind.  I’d like to complete with James Allen’s :   As we think in our hearts, so are we.   I completely agree with him. How about you?
Rolling my eyelids towards sky,  did I see an a logy round object,  lacking exuberance, twas today’s  moon. Like ours, it’s character amends  everyday. One day …gloomy,  dull, the other day…bright someday.  It’s moon, we admire….  adds beauty to the sky, reaving  sun’s light, brightens the slobbish,  night sky, proliferates the beauty  of the nature. Neither a profligate,  in luminosity, like the sun, nor a  miser alike darkness. It’s something  neutrally forged by Him, may be.  Resembling our life style, may be, not to some..  Fortnight later, it disappears….  Fortnight later, becomes effulgent….  Like, some days very gloomy and,  dormant, in one’s life….  some days bright and gale…  Life is nothing but a cycle of  eventful happenings, may be,  similar to moon, a cycle of  brightness and darkness..
It was well said by Rousseau “Man is born free but everywhere he is in chains”. What Rousseau meant, according to me, is that man is leading a free and unrestricted life.   But from the moment man has entered the civil society all his freedoms and liberty have been finished.   Yes. Man’s life in the civil society is an artificial life. It is a false and untrue life. Man in the society becomes highly formal and sophisticated. He becomes greedy and wicked. The life in the civil society is not natural. It is a pretentious life. H
