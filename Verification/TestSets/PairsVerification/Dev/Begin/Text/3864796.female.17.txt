I LOVE The Honorary Title. Concert Monday with Jen!  Work was cool tonight, as usual. Tommy is my homeboy. He gave me a kiss on the cheek, "so totally fab"... I smell like the work kitchen.  Well, as if anyone who reads this cares... I talked to Matt last night again and I sent him a few CDs. For me, that's pretty exciting.  I was planning on going to see the new M. Night Shyamalan movie with Nikole, but she saw it already, so if anybody wants to go see it, let me know, Kelly maybe? Other that that, I saw Napoleon Dynamite the other night, which I think I already mentioned, but it was really funny, at least I thought so.  "I'm filling in the empty spaces where you, you left your mark" Random Honorary Title quote from Cats In Heat, because I'm listening to it. Peace out  Cuidado Piso mojado Caution Wet Floor

I just ran a few errands, went to the post office to send a few CDs to   someone   in Nantucket, and then I picked up my pictures from Walgreens... oh yeah then I stopped at Burger King because I'm fat. Well I have to say that I got the funniest roll of pictures developed, I haven't laughed so hard by myself in a long time. Unfortunately I can't post all of them because Nikole, Kelly, and I copied the pictures from something else... a long story. But I have a few to post, like my new hair cut, pictures of Matt!, and a funny picture of Nikole.   Oh yeah Steve Lega is cool.
matt just called me!!! just thought i'd say this because i was excited... he's so dreamy
Today I opened the new bank account, and I have an ATM card now... yes! After that my mom and I went down to Elmwood and ate lunch and went in all the stores, I saw a cool pair of shoes that I would buy if i hadven't been spending so much on shoes lately...  I got my hair cut, then I dyed it... I like it a lot.  I think I am going to see Napoleon Dynomite tonight, but before that, Joe and I are getting the cake log at DQ when we visit Jenny.  And risking sounding like a dork... I like Ashlee Simpson, I don't know why, I guess she's just cute. Oh well, just call me mainstream...
Saw  I, Robot  tonight... it was really good actually! I love big Willie style, aka Will Smith. He's "jacked" in this movie.  I think that maybe I'm going to start a checking account tomorrow at the bank, at First Niagara maybe, then I'm going to use my Fleet account to save for England next summer, and the First Niagara will be for shopping and for saving money for clothes and what not.  Also, I
