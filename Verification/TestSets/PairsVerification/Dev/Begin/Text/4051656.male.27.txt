I ended up doing part of the suggestions found on the  urlLink Crackbaby.com  article. The part I did was to make all my applications call Firefox instead of IE. So now, when I click on a hyperlink inside of an MSN chat window, the URL opens in Firefox instead of IE. The method is pretty simple. Here are the instructions for disabling IE.  Do a search through the registry for 'iexplore.exe' and 'url.dll'. Replacing  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT  instances of these two with the path to your alternative browser seems to do the trick. I now have all my other Microsoft apps that would normally call IE, now calling Firefox.  For instance, I have Mozilla Firefox as my alternate browser so I replace with the following:  open/command -> C:PROGRA~1MOZILL~1FIREFOX.EXE -url "%1" DefaultIcon -> C:PROGRA~1MOZILL~1FIREFOX.EXE,1   It seems to have worked for me. Give it a try. Don't forget to back up your registry before editing it. You might have to restore it if all goes badly.
urlLink Rockstar Games  video game  Manhunt  is in the news.  urlLink Some kid murdered another kid , and both the police and the killers' parents are blaming the game. This is retarded. First, the game had an M rating which is 17 and up in America, and 18 and up in Great Britan, where this murder happened. The murderer in question was 17 years old, which means either he got a friend to buy the game for him, or his parents bought it. Either way, the parents knew he was playing it. After the hearing, Stefan's father, Patrick, said the boys used to play "Manhunt", a game on PlayStation 2, in which players earned points for killing people.  So, right off the bat, we can blame the parents for allowing their child to play a game which he was not old enough to even buy, and which they knew was about killing for points.  One might also argue that video games don't cause violent behavior. This is evidenced by the  millions  of people of all ages playing violent video games and  not  murdering people. I personally play all the violent video games I can, and anyone who knows me would tell you that I am an extremely nice, non-violent person. Saying the video game caused this kid to be violent ignores tons of evidence that the video game doesn't actually make people violent. One might also argue that people with violent tendencies will gravitate toward these types of games. I bet this kid has a few more games that are also violent, he just happens to like this one the most.  If your child is playing video games that are violent, and he/she ends up killing someone; please people look somewhere besides the gaming industry. It's not their fault, no matter how much you want it to be.
Despite my girlfriends very cute protests, I went ahead and named this entry Winkie Pinkie ;)  She's been working in a pre-school for about 4 months now, and has run the gambit of childhood illnesses. Everything from the sniffles to full blown f
