I landed another one today :). They are so hard. And I was doing some tight boardslides. I can't wait until I get a camcorder. At GameStop at the mall today, I found a PS2 controller that plugs into a PC's USB port that I wanted to get... to play my GTA and THPS games with. I'm broke, so I have to wait until I get my allowance on Thursday. Well, that's it.
urlLink Weird News   urlLink 1337   Damn it, I stayed up late again, I'm out.
I just remembered something. Kevin only called  once  all day! I wonder if he's alright? Usually I get 5-10 calls a day from him  at least ! I'm going to his house tomorrow to see if he's ok.
I wish I could do a kickflip and catch it high in the air every time. I can kickflip most of the time, if I'm going slow, and I don't catch it until it hits the ground. I need to practice and hopefully I'll get better. Once I am an expert at kickflips, I'm moving on to backside flips (which I can rarely do, but fakie, which is easier). Damn skating is hard work.  I just got done playing Counter-Strike. I pwned so many noobs on it (go to  urlLink Pwned.nl  if you think I'm a retard)! Actually, I'm the one that got killed the most—95% of the people that play have no life outside of CS, so they are  experts . It pisses me off. Even when I join a "newbie" server, I get tons of pros waiting to shoot me in the head once I turn a corner. Oh well, I quit.
Skatepark again today... yay. I tried to rock-to-fakie in the medium bowl at the skatepark (4 feet maybe) and I fell on my right hip—the same one I have been falling on for the past month! Damn it hurt like hell. I could barely walk, but I was still trying tricks in the bowls and grinding ledges. Luckily, I didn't fall on it again lol. I probably would have broken my hip. I was happy today because Kevin didn't come with us to the skatepark, just Me, Scott, and Alec. Kevin likes to brag a little too much.  Before I went to the skatepark I went to the Dollar Store with Scott, Alec, and Kevin to buy some candles to use as curb wax. We waxed up a curb at Schweitzer Elementary and tried to grind it. We could all grind it except Kevin—he weighs too much. If he went on a diet he would be able to grind better. After the wax wasn't working very good, we brought a metal bar from Alec's house and set it on the curb and we just grinded on that. It worked a  lot  better. We called it a curb condom. I can't wait to use Alec's condom again tomorrow - lol.
Finally I escaped from my boredom :). Here's how:  Ok, yesterday I  was  bored. I skated all day again and ended up spending the night at Matt's h
