Well managed to   wake up at 6am... went to Mac at white sands for breakfast by myself. Lol not that I'm a loner or what, I just felt like it. it felt so good to walk in the midst of daylight as fresh air starts to fill around me. Even as I walked I walked with a little beat to it, like as if there was music being played in my mind. It felt real good. Then I got home after a good breakfast and went straight back to bed. yet again I woke up at 2pm, had wesern for lunch, went to see Marlina to get the campaign results and then had a last mintue decision to head to Alvin's house.

So yeah I was in school till 6. Well of course I have to thank my friends like Sing Ho, Wee Cheng and Erwin for being with me all the while. They are indeed cool friends to have.    Then we decided...lets go swimming! Lol it was so funny its a Friday but the poolside at DTE was empty! So we had the whole place to ourselves. We started playing and shouting and messing around it was so much fun. I never laughed so much ever in my life...well at least for the pass few weeks.
