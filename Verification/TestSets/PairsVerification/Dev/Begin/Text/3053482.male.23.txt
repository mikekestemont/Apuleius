i just saw "signs" starring bruce willis and joacquin pheonix. it was a kick ass movie. one of the best i have seen in a long time. i recommend it to anyone who likes good movies.
its 5 am and something woke me up. normally i would just go back to sleep but for some reason i decided to go burn a cd on my brother's computer. blink 182's take off your pants and jacket.  last night was rather uneventful, as usual. i took my dog for a walk with my brother john and parents. john and i were supposed to go to nashville to check out some coffee place in hopes to find a place to hang out that isn't a bar. my impression of life in tennessee so far is that unless you live right in nashville, life can get pretty boring out in the 'burbs of franklin. not once have i seen a famous country star, and supposedly they all live in franklin. maybe it's not so much that i'm bored, but that i just miss my old life. which old life, i'm not really sure, because back in buffalo i don't really recall doing much of anything. the "nothing" that we did do seemed fun though. i think i just need to make some friends. on monday i start my orientation for grad school, so i'm sure the friends will be pourin' in.

Going to see Elvis Costello Oct. 30 There is still a black dot on my molar My chest hair grew back Grad school is like Undergrad school except undergrads think you know everything. I have to pick my research advisor soon. It's a weird process because all the grad students are fighting over a few certain people and some kids will do anything in their power to get in the group they want. Basically it's a research group @#%$ blocking festival.   now i must go proctor an exam.

Today I leave for a 12 day trip to Western Europe. I will be visiting Berlin, Amsterdam, Paris, Geneva, Rome, and some random cities in Germany. I don't have time to say anything else because I have to go.
I am finding it virtually impossible to study for my last two final exams. My brain has been unable to concentrate. I cannot actually remember the proper studying techniques.  Anyway, yesterday, a
