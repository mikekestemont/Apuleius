Well, 1 day left... Less than 36 hours and I will be in the presence of my favorite band in the world. For those of you who don't know who that is. It is the DAVE MATTHEWS BAND... man I even love the name...j/k....or am I?? Anyway, I am a little tired last night I got home about 3ish and was still wound in my head so I was up until about 4am. I had some stuff on my mind, so a friend of mine went out to eat with me. She is so beautiful! Personality, Physically, Kind, Caring....I could go on but I dont need to. She has helped me a lot lately, more than she knows. Anyway after we ate and talked, I still was WIRED when I got home, so I played some online poker; DAD had been hooked on watching it, so I play online just to have a little fun with it. I listened to Dave, becasue when we were talking last night, we got onto that subject. I told her about one of the songs that had reminded me of something that came up in conversation. Some of you may know it.... Say Goodbye. One of my all time fav's. Anyway....once we got done eating, she wanted to hear it, so the Dave cd I made her had it. We got in her car and listened to a couple songs, and then got to that one.. IT IS HARD FOR ME TO SKIP DAVE SONGS TO GET TO JUST ONE!!!! OK?!?!? So I made her listen to a couple others first.... but anyway, the point of the story. I got in a Dave mood, I hadn't been earlier. I was still in the Christian mood from the concerts the past weekend. BTW... it doesn't take very much to get me in a "Dave Mood". Still, I wasn't really craving, until then. As I am writing this post, I am listening to the Central Park CD. Great CD. Best Live show I have heard them release yet. 100,000 Fans...loud enough you can hear them on the cd singing with Dave and the Boys. Moral of the story... I ramble... and jump back an forth between ideas. Anyway, that is all I have to say about that.... More When I return from my trip this weekend.
Congrats to my boy Nick McPherson for making the  urlLink OU Drumline . Nick was one of my seniors from Noble High. He tried out at OU for the line and made snare. See Great Teachers....great students...LOL. Well I can't take all the credit... he has talent, just needed exposure to some real drumming. Real stuff that real lines play... so, Alan and I helped as much as we could... Still he learned alot, and is learning even more. I just wish all the kids down there had that potential. SOME could if they wanted to put their heart into it.  Anyway... I miss drumming so bad.. I went to Regal Cinemas and watched the DCI Championship Quaterfinals, LIVE from Denver. M
