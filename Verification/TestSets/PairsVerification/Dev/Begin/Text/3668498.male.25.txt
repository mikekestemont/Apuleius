I think the reason I have no comments is because all the ladeez think I'm some kind of Fat Baterd look alike or something.  Well you thought wrong gerleez.  Get a hankie to wipe the drool.                  I'm just fkn around :) enjoy the pics tho.           Doo de Deun!!
:D  Here's a list of comics I picked up today.    1.  Astonishing X-men #1 Director's Cut   where Director's Cut = Rip off 2.  Astonishing X-men #2 3.  Mystique #16 4.  Superman #206  Jim Lee what happened?  what is this garbage? 5.  Wanted #4  Bout fkn time.  Better be worth the wait. 6.  Robin #127  Ok the New Robin gimmick is done, i want to see a good story now. 7.  The Flash #211  So Awsome! Geoff Johns is doin great shit with the series.  I still like the Waid run better.   8.  Teen Titans #12  Another Johns book.  Its been goin great and McKone is an amazing artist 9.  Excalibur #2  Wow.  The Magneto situation is fked up.  Evidently the Magneto at the end of Morrison's run (Planet X) wasn't the real Magneto.  Damn they didn't waste any time bringing him back.  Not just him but Xorn as well.  It ticked me off seeing this happen but Claremont is handling it well.  Magneto comes back is like "Oh come on you know I don't act like that and I could never do those things" and we're all like "shit he's fkn right! How the fk did I fall for that?"  Eventhough I believe Morrison meant for that to be the real Magneto.  I also got a Previews and the smaller Marvel Previews.  If I have more time during this week I'll put reviews for each.  Anythoughts above are just from skimming through the issues.
Paul M. Johnson Jr was beheaded.  I pray for him and his family.         Today was kind of uneventful.  I worked the overnight as usual 11 - 7:30 a.m.  My friend T called me up asking to go to a job interview with him.  It was for a low level job in a labratory.  I basically sat in an office for an hour with some drawings I did back in 2000.  I had forgotten about them and it was cool to see how much I've grown artistically.  After that it was around lunch time so we stopped by Blimpies and Circuit City.  Hung out afterwards playing the awsome Chronicles of Riddick for Xbox.         I've been checking the Dc forum hoping to have gotten some kind of response to the short story I posted but I got nutt'n.  O well.  I'm enjoying it and T gave it a thumbs up so that's good enough for me.  I hope my little sister likes it.  I gave her a link but haven't heard anything from her.  She's never been into comics but I lent her the Tpb's of Y and she loved it.  So now I pick up the issues for myself and the tpbs for her, then I pass them on to whoever is interested.    ookokok I'm tired.  Working tonight :/    Doonin OUT!
