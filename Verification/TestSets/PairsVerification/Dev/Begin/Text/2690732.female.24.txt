29 and counting   Driving is the worst. I don't get out much myself. I lead a very uneventful life ninety percent of the time, but, Amanda always has a mile long to-do list, and it being that her car is brake-less, and my car being a stick-shift (which she can't drive... actually she can... but thats a whole other story altogether) anyways: Her and I drive around  a'lot  doing errands, and its torture enough to count the days left here in "good old Michigan", but to be in my car, and driving around this slush covered state, constantly having to blare the de-frost, and scrap the windows, my feet slipping below on the sheet of ice that has formed on my floor mat... it's unbelievably tempting to just drive. And to keep driving... until I can turn off the heat in my car, until I can roll down the windows, until the roads are dry and ice free.
"I hate html"  Sadly enough, it took Chuck and I most of the afternoon to figure out how to add links and change the text color for our blog. We searched through the many lines of html in our 'blog template' looking for jumbled messes of letters and symbols that actually made sense...

Unfortunately, I think $3 is looking pretty good for the California fund. She got about fifty total.   I finally sold the truck (a giant '89 F-150) and bought myself a '95 Escort LX. I like the car a lot. It's an automatic, so I won't have to shift in the worst traffic in America, and the body and interior are in great shape. I know nothing about cars, so I didn't really bother asking much about the engine and stuff, but the guy was a mechanic and said they put in a new engine with only 60,000 miles on it. I'm putting my faith in a guy with oil-soaked hands and clothing, but he seemed too dense to be putting one over on me. (I hope that comment never comes back to bite me in the ass)   The room I'm staying in at Jessica and Andrew's place flooded the other day. Fortunately my belongings were on the other side of the room. Actually, most o
