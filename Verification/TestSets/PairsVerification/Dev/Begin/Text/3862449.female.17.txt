Yesterday we did our weekly lab. For this one we had to determine focal lengths for two different lenses. I liked this lab alot because&nbsp;our results came out pretty accurate and it was really cool. While we were doing the lab, two guys from the D&C took pictures and interviewed us. After lunch, i met with Dr. Baum and her husband. They further explained to me their project and why they are studying active galactic nuclei. I learned about the theory they are trying to prove, that all AGN galaxies are essentially the same, but appear different because of the different angles we are viewing&nbsp;them from. After the meeting, i continued working on my list.
Yesterday we took a field trip to the Eastman KodakResearch building. I thought it was very informational and for the most part interesting. We learned about facial recognition software, image recognition software, different types of printers and scanners, 3-d imaging, and OLED screens. I thought the idea of machines being able to recognize whats in photos so they could sort them for the customer and adapt their processes, was really cool. I think it is amazing that people know how to use math and computer programming to make a machine almost intelligent. I wish i could have seen some of the math behind it and the actual programming. The OLED screens were also neat. I can't believe how thin they are and how sharp the image looks.
Monday i&nbsp;worked on the bibliographic list all day again, and finally finished it and emailed it to Dr. Baum. I had to use a different database to find some of the lesser know sources, but managed to get all the information. I visited ally down in the basement when i went to get some hot chocolate from the machine, and she showed me the tests, and data she was working with. She was doing something with beads in different sized cylinders and computing ratios. I think she was modeling different types of soil.
On Friday, Dr. Baum didn't come into work because she was sick, but she emailed me some stuff to do. I have to make another list of references to all the sources she wants to look at. This list will be exactly the same as the one i made for Dr. Kastner. I am learning to make better judgements about which&nbsp;references to include this time, because often there are more than 100 for a given source. Therefore, i have to pick in choose which ones to use. This task is time consuming, and includes ALOT of copying from the internet and pasting into word documents, but i do get to see some interesting papers. Hopefully Dr. Baum will return today.
I had an extremely productive day yesterday. I decided to&nbsp;do a six hour day with no lunch break because i had to leave for a doctor's appointment at 2:30.&nbsp;I got a ton of work done in this time. In the morning i met with Dr. Baum and we talked about the progress i was making on the lists. I f
