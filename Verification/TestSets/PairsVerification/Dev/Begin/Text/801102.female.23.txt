Things that piss me off:  *  Playboy 's Girls of the Big 12.  I am so freaking sorry for being a female, a feminist and in the possession of two ovaries.  I'm not mad at  Playboy .  That magazine is for 45 year-old men who want to feel like they're doing something racy but are really trying to understand the cartoons.  I'm mad at those dumbass girls who took off their clothes and pronounced MU a party school with a lot of bisexual tendencies, like girls are making out all over the place just to please the boys.  Yes, I have time to go to boat parties and make-out with the unattractive girls (so the feature gal says) that run rampant across the Quad.  I do it between squeezing myself into pleather pants and buying teeny tiny shorts that say "MIZZOU" across the butt.  And what about the part where she talks about guys dating down because of the low quality of girls?  Excuse me?????  I think boys on this campus are lucky they get dates at all.  It'll be a fine day when women come to the realization that we don't have to take their crap anymore and fire their sorry asses from every Fortune 500 company across the board.   (*Disclaimer: I am not speaking about the boys that I love and cherish and who delight me to no end.  I am speaking of the boys that wear the baseball hats with the word "Cocks" written across the front.)   * Anybody going to class in a shirt that does not reach the top of their pants.  This is Philosophy of War and Peace, not Look Like a Hoochie on Thursday Night.  * Whoever deemed shoes that make you bleed "appropriate footwear for women."   Things that make me rather happy:  * Rock Quarry Road is finally open.  * Having a super cool new friend whom I believe is my long lost twin.  * Missing my boyfriend (not that it's good that we're apart, but good that I don't like it)
How much do I like Justin Timberlake's solo song?  A lot.  A whole lot.  Now, at first, I was a little skeptical.  But by the third listen I was totally hooked.  It makes me want to dance.  Dance naked, even.  But that could just be a genetic thing.  It's reminiscent of very early Michael Jackson.  This is definitely a bonus, but as Abby points out, look what happened to the Jackson 5.  I watched television for more than 4 hours last night.  It was amazing.  I now know how Clark Bars are made.  I love the Food Network.
I've been dorking around with this template for more than an hour and what do I achieve?  A link to my e-mail.  Please use it so I know it wasn't all in vain.  I went to the Corn Maze today and got sufficiently lost.  It was a darn good time, well worth my $6.  Then I ate pizza and chips and salsa.  Soon I will put on makeup and play Nintendo.  Do days get a
