Tryouts will be Saturday and Sunday (June 5th and 6th) from 10-2 on both days.  The location will be Marietta High School (directions below).  Please send an email to evil_wood@hotmail.com to sign-up for tryouts, we'd like to know how many to expect.  Looking forward to seeing everyone there and let me know if you have any questions.  Directions... I-75 North to the North Loop (not sure the exit number... North Marietta Parkway).  Take left under 75, cross over Cobb Parkway (hwy 41).  Take a right onto Whitlock, follow Whitlock down past Kroger.  Take left at the second light after Kroger and an immediate right into the school.  Fields are in the back.
I posted this under Sweetwater results, but it'll probably get lost.  Please let me know if you have paid the $14 tournament fee for Sweetwater.  I know that Angela, Kate, Eric and possibly Wood have paid.  If you haven't paid, please do so at skills/drills tonight.  Thanks!
Due to the core ranking meeting shenanigans, we're moving the Skills/Drills workout to Thursday this week.  We'll definitely bee at Coan Rec.  For directions, click on the title above and scroll down to Coan Rec.
Scratchy (3-3) made it to the A quarters, Itchy (3-4) won the B bracket.

For those who are interested, this is Rival's tentative summer schedule including tournaments, practices, etc.
We're having a track workout today at Grady at 7ish.  Current plan is to do some 800s.  Bill is in charge.
Rival's first charity poker tournament was a success.  We had 16 entrants and made $200.  We can either put this money straight towards tourney fees, or look to using it to buy discs to sell.  Maybe a disc with a bomb on it.  Also, let's start looking at dates to host the next tournament.
Here are the teams:  Itchy - Evil, Eric, Lee, Cliff, Chris, Angela, Julia, Lisa, Kelly Scratchy - Lori, Martin, Greg, Jeremy, Ned, Dan, Wooten, LPS, Shrop  The website is http://home.earthlink.net/~tnasnott/.  Directions can be found at http://home.earthlink.net/~tnasnott/id1.html.  Also, just to repeat for the new additions, Lee has graciously offered to let people crash at his place for the weekend if they'd like.  You should probably bring a sleeping bag and towels and a pillow, etc. as he may run out of bed space.
Looks like we finally have enough dues in to buy jerseys. (Note: if you haven't paid your dues yet, please do so, Bill and I are still in the red and we still need money to get the jerseys printed.)
