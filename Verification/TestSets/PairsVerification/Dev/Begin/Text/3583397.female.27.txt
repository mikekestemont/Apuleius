What are your dreams?  I have a ton of them.  I don't mean the literal ones that you have when you go to bed.  I mean the ones you have about your future.  (But I would rather call them goals or hopes, because that way, it seems reachable.  :)  Here are some of mine:  I hope of having two kids (halfway there), 1 boy and 1 girl.  I hope of giving them a better life than my parents gave me (and that's a tall order!) by being able to give them the best possible education, and provide them with the best material and emotional support.    I hope of still being happily married with Stan, going out on dates regularly, enjoying ourselves, even after 20+ years of marriage.  I hope of Stan and I owning a successful business one day that keeps us busy and financially secure.  I hope of employing a lot of people who can help us run the business which gives us time to enjoy life with each other and the kids.  I hope of having the money to buy a house in a subdivision without draining my bank account or having to take out a loan.  I hope of one day being able to travel once a year without worrying about the expense.    I hope of being able to provide my children with homes when the time comes for them to take the plunge into married life. I hope that Stan and I will be able to bring our children up in such a way that they grow up to become successful, independent, responsible, hard working and kind people.  I hope that Stan and I will have a loooong and happy life together (hopefully, see our grandkids grow up).  Ah.. it's nice to hope about the future. :)  Here's to hoping all of this will come true. :)
Caitlyn's Baptism and Birthday    Caitlyn had her baptism last weekend (finally).  We also celebrated her first birthday early with a simple dinner with friends and family.  It was a good day. :)  Caitlyn really enjoyed herself, she was playing and socializing with my cousins and guests until 11:30 PM.  It was nice to see her socialize because she has a tendency to be shy like me. :)   * * * * * * * *     Doctor's Check Up    I took Caitlyn to her doctor for her regular check up this morning and was relieved to find out she has finally gained the weight.  She was a bit underweight for almost 2 months since she is so active and she doesn't eat that much.  Knowing her weight is finally proportionate to her height is such a relief.  She's on the upper 25 percentile for both height and weight now.  Whew!  She also had her shot for Hepa A today.  And she didn't cry again.  She hasn't cried during her last three shots which really surprised the doctor.  ;)  This is great because at least she hasn't got a phobia of doctors.. yet.    I was given a tip by a friend that t
