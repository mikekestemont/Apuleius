Travelling in a train in the subway is like being in a pessimistic persons mind. Everything outside is dark! The best way to entertain is, listening to music or reading a book. Currently, I am reading a Fine Balance by Rohinton Mistry. The blog is just  a description of my commute today from home to work.    ===================== Damn this elevator. It’s slow. Wish `was like one in my office. Its late. Dukhi is listening about the fate of the Bhola. Lucky Bhola. His fingers salvaged his hands. Doing without the fingers is much better than without the hand. Sigh!.The lights have to turn green right when I have to cross. While the gap on the roads were being filled by the cars, the gaps in Dukhi’s understanding about the world were being filled by the daily conversation of Dhuki's father and mother at supper. Oops the snow. Why does it have to turn to ice! Dukhi's mother is fasting. Whenever she said that it meant there was not much food. Horrible! The train driver cannot leave the doors open for one more sec. Dukhi had learnt to bring the carcass and remove the hide and tan it. The meat of the carcass is delicious. But it’s hard to get dead cattle. The do not die often. Yikes! People dont even realize. Why do they have to always stand right near the door? Move in folks!! Make room! Dukhi's wife would steal the milk for Ishvar every night. The nights are pitch dark but a mother would do anything for the kid. Dukhi wondered if he should offer to do it. But he lay indifferent. He also lay in oblivion as the mother was mishandled by the chokidar in the orchard. This is pathetic!! I chose the wrong car. This car does not have air conditioning. Ishvar was excited to have gotten the chance to accompany his dad to bring the carcass home. Dukhi had instructed Ishvar to stay close and observe what they did. But the cow was alive. Ishvar's cheek was pierced by the horns. They traded the carcass to survive. Etrade! Americas` best e-broker. Ting! Thank god the office elevator is not as slow.
If all of us are unique, arent we all same ?
* The necessary condition for life is survival, the sufficient condition is happiness.  * When you are thinking you are surviving. When you are not, you are happy
The thing that amazes me most, is the tranformation from an abstract thought ,lacking tangibility, to a concrete realization. It is magic. From nothing to something. It is like solidfying the air. The air, we cannot touch. The air, we cannot see. Yet we know it is there.   That which is tangible, we call it reality. The abstract is like energy. The energy somehow gets transformed into an electron or a proton. A particle ! The tangible comes to life. A body losing life is similar to an electron losing its energy.   If there is one thing that is abundantly available in this universe, it is energy. Energy i
