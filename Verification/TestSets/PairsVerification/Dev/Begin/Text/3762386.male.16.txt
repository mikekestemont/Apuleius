i got this email a few hours ago.     clay..i am highly dissapoint in everything you are saying..  first of all not ALL rap is bad..it is music..and if it's what people talent in, then that's their business nothing wring with that. STOP DISSING IT! and it's just the media that makes rap seem all sex oriented..ITS THE MEDIAS RAP! they feel a need to degrade women like that..w/o knowing it..there IS rap that isn't so sexually oriented so, don't stereotype it all.  and no not ALL girls expect their dates to dance real well to rap..and it is NOT near impossible for guys to dance to it!>=O! and NO not JUST breakdancers, gay, or pimps can dance. THERE ARE some respectable guys out there that can dance. and THERE ARE gay people and pimps that CAN't dance..where the fudgin hell did u get that from. STOP STErEOTYPING THINGS!  AND! it is not JUST rap that is all like that..theres some rock and pop n many different kinds of music that are like that..just a way for people to express themselves so don't judge people by their music.  AANNDDD!!! your lil rant about "the notebook" you shouldn't judge it like that specially since you HAVENT seen it yet! just let movies be movies. and NOT all girls like that kinda stuff! WHY ARE THEY CALLED CHICK FLICKS??!! stupid stereotypes..ITS NOT RIGHT!>=O! and "feel good" stuff wtf is wrong with that? wtf is wrong with movies that make people happy? seriously..and soo wat if those movies arent real??! or funny??! there ARE different genres of movies!! OF COURSE a movie categorized in the DRAMA/FICTION section! they wont be funny and/or real!! orr they could be!! but w/e!!!! soo YEA!!  im watching you...       nice job whoever sent this email. apparently you have trouble distinguishing between typing unreadable bullshit on instant messenger and writing a somewhat intelligent email. please, it isn't necessary to type two question marks and two exclamation points to emphasize your point. i realize i do not have perfect grammar in my posts, but that's because i'm lazy, and i write a lot. save for a few minor contraction errors, the only errors in grammar on my posts is bad capitalization. you on the other hand, are unable to write one fucking sentence without tempting my spell-check to commit suicide.   how am i supposed to be able to properly mock this sender's intentions if i can't find out what it was? i can barely read this email. "wtf" "!>=O!" are not words. don't rape my eyes like that.   and what the hell was "AANNDDD!!! " ? do you have some sick desire to make it seem like you are making progress in your email? i've seen retarded kids write better insults in finger-painting class.    you say that the media degrades women? ok, i'll agree with that, but unfortunately you left out the part where it's the women dancing, not the media. women degrade themselves when they dance like that. no one forced them to be media-hugging whores, i don't see girls f
