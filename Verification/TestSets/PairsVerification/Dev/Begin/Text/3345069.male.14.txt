Only 12 more day that we have to get up to go to school. This should go by really quickly. I am also excited about high school and playing freshman football and running track in the spring. Good luck to all the other new freshman.
Early last week, our class picked stocks to use in an expierement. I am happy to announce that my stock ANF, Abercrombie and Fitch Co., has gone up from $33.90 to about $34.85, which is a 2.80% rise.
I have many plans for the summer. This July I going to be on a two week roadtrip through Wisconsin, Minnesota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Idaho, Montana, Nebraska, and Missouri. On top of that I think I have a good chance at scoring some good tickets for some upcoming concerts. When I'm not traveling or going to a concert I hope to hang out with old friends, that I haven't seen in quite some time. Also I am now able to get a job with a work permit so I will have some extra cash. I think this will be a summer to remember.
Well I really don't have much of interest to post. Although I am pretty excited about the Chicago Cubs finally turning it around. As of now they have won their last four games after sweeping the Padres over the weekend. Hopefully this will continue for the rest of the season, which seems to be going by pretty fast with 35 of 162 games played. Hopefully Mark Prior and Gonzo can get back soon, to really make the Cubs unstopable. I think that's all for now, but you can visit  urlLink www.cubs.com  if you are interested in the Cubs.
I think I have been able to fix this or will be able too in the near future so I will start posting again.
I'm so bored. I need a summer job, atleast until football camp starts. If anyone has any ideas for jobs near Des Plaines, or has anything else for me to do please either leave me a message or email me at sobolewski.m@earthlink.net
Bob's party is tommorow. First party of the summer. Hope it turns out ok. I might be able to drop by Sandy's party afterward by I'm not sure. It all depends on how long Bob's party is.
