Aside from the bestial porn film my college friend so carelessly told me about while we were doing lunch,  another reason why I have a nauseated look every time I pass by a rotisserie is my introduction to "Frankenchick", the featherless, genetically modified chicken (I wanted to decapitate Eurydike when she sent me the Frankenchick image via e-mail).   How could you possibly eat such an ugly creature? Hell, this is not a chicken. This is a deformed, mutated monster.   I just love my vegetables
I am smart...Or maybe I am just having an illusion of grandeur...maybe it's all in my mind~a false pretense to cover up all of my insecurities. I have made a lot of moronic decisions in my life, all of which I regret terribly.   I inspired my good friend Eddie Vedder to sing this Pearl Jam hit (our torrid love affair went kaput nine years ago. Even if my love for him remains at nuclear intensity, I had to end our relationship because of his incredible fame.)   (Well, I don't give a fig about my controversial break-up with Vedder any longer. I am now engaged to a sensitive, philosophical NC artist so who cares about (as Weird Al Yankovic puts it) Mr. Spokesman for the disaffected grunge generation. Eurydike can have him.)    DAUGHTER by PEARL JAM    Alone...listless...breakfast table in an otherwise empty room  Young girl...violins...center of her own attention  The, mother reads aloud, child, tries to understand it  Tries to make her proud   The shades go down, it's in her head   Painted room...can't deny there's something wrong...   Don't call me daughter, not fit to   The picture kept will remind me   Don't call me daughter, not fit to   The picture kept will remind me  Don't call me...   She holds the hand that holds her down  She will...rise above
~  USELESS INFO~      1. I crunch on ice cubes (my sole addiction).   2. I eat fish food at age four.   3. I once played a character in an independent film.   4. After hearing my college friend tell me about this porn film he watched which advocates the practice of bestiality, I totally gave up on chicken.   5. Eddie Vedder was in love with me.   6. I believe I am acquainted with the reincarnation of The Tsar of All Russias, Ivan IV (he delights in scowling at me in class every morning).   7. I ALWAYS eat cereal straight from the box.   8. I can eat a hundred dumplings in 60 minutes (which probably gives you an idea that I have a large gullet).   9. I am engaged to Superman (and his real name is Paul Ambrose. Clark Kent is just a screen name. And by the way, he's not a Kryptonite. He's Italian).   10. I am your travel agent for guilt trips.
My friend Eurydike, a clairvoyant and a self~confessed female chauvinist confided to me about her encounter with a couple of vicious jerks who unfortunately she had a brief affair with. This journal entry is not advisable for people with no sense of irony.      Vicious Jerk number one: Orkhomenos~ He may look suspiciously l
