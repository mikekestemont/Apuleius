I had my daughter when I was 19, and my social life died shortly thereafter. There I was, working three jobs, going to school and supporting my child %100 of the time and %100 by myself. By the time she was a year old the thought that it would be nice to have someone come along to love and care for both of us was set firmly in my mind...it just didn't happen. Some guys got scared and ran, other ignored her, and others were too selfish to care for anyone other than themselves. Behind the scenes I fought for five years just to get child support from her father through the incompetent machinations of DHR.They finally got him in court before my daughter's second birthday where the judge said, "I don't want to make the father pay anything, he needs his education." Oh! Of course, his education was much more important than mine because he's a guy, and in this state that's one step below being Christ. Here I was doing all the work myself and going to school, but still somehow Sargent Panty Waste's education was more important than mine? He was ordered to pay $100 a month. Not even enough to cover the amount of pampers she was using in that time.So, six months later he hadn't paid a cent which means that he was in contempt. No one acted to stop this. Just one year ago the amount was upped to $400. He pays on time now. We still don't see him. His choice, not mine. I am happy to say that I have graduated school and been working as a journalist for about 1 year. It feels good, but it is lonely. There is still no one in my life to fill the role of love interest for me and potential father for my daughter. I doubt there ever will be, and I have learned not hold my breath. Last night my boyfriend broke up with me by shouting "I hate you" five times at me over the phone and telling me it was going to take him a whopping two months to get over the hurt I had caused him. As the shouts of I hate you echo through my mind over and over again today, I am pretty damn sure it will hurt me much longer than that. To him, my child was something I dealt with, she was my responsibility and he never had to change his plans or modify something he might want to do with his friends for her sake.He said he wanted children and a family but never once did the fact that I couldn't find a sitter for her stop him from having plans or never did the thought that always having to drive to his place and pack up stuff for two people and get up early to take her to daycare the next day might be hard for me. People who say casually that they want children have no idea what it's really like to have t
