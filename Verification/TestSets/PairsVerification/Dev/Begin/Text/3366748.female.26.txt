I really enjoy having a job where I can work like a dog overtime for six weeks, and be off for six weeks.  However, when I don't have anything planned for the off six weeks, I tend to get bored.  Like this six weeks, I am off and I don't have anything planned.  I am taking some internet distance learning courses for the summer session, but they don't start until June 1.  I tried to access the courses, too, and it won't let me until the start date.  Dammit.   I have decided to take whatever I can through distance learning, because of the busy 6 week period at work.  During that 6 week period, we travel a lot and are often gone from 5 in the morning until 10 at night.  I know it sounds like a bitch, but that's what I get for getting 6 weeks off every three months.  When I get to a point where I can't take anything dl anymore, I am going to sh=chedule all my classes for Tuesday, Thursday, and just be unavailable those days.  Which sucks, because during the busy 6 weeks, two days off is a LOT of money, but what can you do?   I spent today on a mission.  I wanted to cook or bake anything I could with whatever I had on hand, (no running to the store for one thing allowed) and then freeze it for a later time.  Thank God for allrecipes.com where you can enter ingredients you have, ingredients you don't have, and it comes up with recipes for you.  One recipe that came up that sounded really good was tres leches cake.  But the problem was, was that I only had 2 leches.  I only had regular milk and a can of evaporated milk.  I didn't have "condensed milk".  I wondered what would happen if I made dos leches, but decided against it.   I eventually got to use the can of evaporated milk in banana cake.  The banana cake smelled so good while it was baking.  It is now in the fridge.  Good for breakfast for me and John over the next few days.  I also made a really sad excuse for an ommlette, but with ketchup it was really good.  John ate most of it when he came home for lunch.  I made peanut butter cookie dough and froze it for when I am ready to make cookies.   Cucumbers were on sale at food city, 6 for a dollar.  I also had a coupon for Italian dressing, and with double coupons, I saved a dollar off of dressing that cost 1.99.  I got these bargains yesterday, and made a big cucumber salad, chopped up whatever tomatoes and chives I had in the fridge, and saved the salad in the fridge.  It's really good!!!
My relationship with John- Sometimes I wish it had happened five years ago.  When I was younger, I was obviously much more romantic than I am now.  I can remember being younger- and it wasn't all that long ago, like 4-5 years ago- a
