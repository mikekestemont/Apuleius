My mosquito net fell down on my head for the second time in 24 hours.  I also have a humidity headache and Oscar and I haven't felt dry in almost 36 hours.  Apparently there will be more of this to look forward to for another 2 months.  Needless to say I cant sleep.    Beside my 2 lessons today, I have to reinstal my computer which has an Asian flu!  Apparently North Korea has a special unit to attack south Korean computers, and much like my own immune system, my anti virus doesn't seem equipped for the Asian viruses.  I have deicided to go back to Mac.  None of this would be happening if I had a Mac!  On a brighter note, kick monkey continues to kick butt in TaeKwon do.  I am no expert by any means, but I am doing better than I expected, and the constant sore feeling in my body is not entirely unwelcomed.  I am going to try YOGA on Monday morning.  Well,  I am going to try to get more shut eye.  I don't have to teach for another 3.5 hours.  K

Well, I don't hate Seoul any more. As a matter of fact I think if I had to spend another year in Korea, Seoul would be a good place to spend it. We spent most of our time in Etaiwan, which is a district (Dong in Korean) that is supported mainly by the US military presence, where you will find "hooker hill" and a Mosque within a few feet of each other, and a place where you can buy middle eastern groceries YAY!!!   We got in Saturday evening, and the first order of business was finding a place to sleep. We checked out a place that seemed clean enough, but was very much like the Iranian caravanserais, and the room didn't even have a window. I "X"ed that place though it was only 30,000 won. We went to another place called the Seoul In (Original name eh?) and the rooms were much better- still no window, but a full on A/C and it was only 45. SO I said "Let's take it", and we did, dumped our things, and went out to discover.   Among some of the incongruous things I saw in Etaiwan, were a couple of Ecuadorians selling handicrafts on the sidewalk, a lot of non Koreans and really up to date fashions. The Korean population was definitely outnumbered by the foreigners, and it was not only surprising, but a bit refreshing. No one stared at us, we just blended in!   We went to "Spy", a very chic little club for a pre-dinner cocktail, and enjoyed a rum and coke in the "Red Rum- oops Room" covered with velvet walls, and snazzy decor- very "Wallpaper".
