you are a national hero! good playing... but of course the dissapointment cannot be spared... too bad it's just not ment to be. i love going to ann's church. ok the truth is i love going to church. but i hate those depressing times.
i'm so excited i'll be going to ann's church tomorrow for nusery duty. i hope that i won't make any of them cry. haha meiyi's going as well but she won't be joining us for nursery duty. ann says she hates children but hey, that's what we all started as isn't it? hmm and i am going to get my "new" bag tomorrow as well....haha at 30 dollars. regina thinks that i should have gotten myself a new bag since it's 30 dollars. thought about it thought she was right but who cares? what matters is that i like the bag and that it really is still quite new isn't it?       yeah the kids will inspire me to be more loving. kindness can be developed. that's what i believe...
i'm back to spill my guts out... didn't do it just now then i got bottled up and became so irritated over dinner. hate it when i am like that. was kind of fuming just now, then ann let me look at this photo album the stuffs really great but all sold out. too bad then. still hoping to get a new guitar. and i am in desprate need of a new back.... backpack to be specific...my other one is like wasted....just like me...      ok there i go again....i'm happy, i'm loved i love. haha. my dad just asked my if i was going to continue learning chinese can you believe it? i just got back my results and am currently fretting about the prelims and he wants me to continue chinese....ermm the answer is never until i get back to J.C ... sobs really hurt ... can't believe nisa. well i guessed it's my fault. once again what's new right? haha just a little hard to accept but i guess i'll get used to it.       well as the comics always say kindness is developed not born...so i guess i can learn to be really nice loveble person. smile. that's all i need to do smile, forgive, forget and never hold any grudge. oh and very importantly, no gossiping. haha starting afresh would be good.      i started reading ba wang ai ren. underneath all that ahem. that they do the story's really nice. hei long is so hot. and lai shi is so cute and true. sigh too bad he had to die. seriously why can't it have a nice happy ending. laishi's so nice that she seriously bears absolutely no grudge at all... zero. you can slap her in the face betray her right in front of her and she can still smile at you! such a nice person...she forgives and forget just like that....      i want to be like her. hmm i feel better now. glad that i made myself a blog . love you lots!
