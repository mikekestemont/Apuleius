why do relationships have to be so hard!!
okaayyy..... this thing is kinda confusing. dunno my way around the website .yet.nway, since my frens are bz at work, i'll just entertain myself with this thing. is this some sort of a diary or something? i haven't actually written a diary. not for a long time anyway. so, how do i get nad's website kat my link? nak call but mesti he's bz gak. been calling a tad too much today. he's probably annoyed with me by now. heh.. talking bout nad, i'm going to newcastle this friday. hopefully i can wake up early coz the train's at 6 am! crazeee or wat? can't wait!coming back on tuesday..very long weekend indeed...sigh....have to do work...hate it. i hate this research shit. have to have a lot of of self-will and motivation. which are two of the main things that i'm not good at.  this is a shame. so much things happened for the past few weeks, and i just discovered this thing. takkanlah nak cerita everything kan? tempted jugak... but kalau i dah start, mesti jadi a long cerpen.haha.. this is cool...i can say watever i wanna say. all the things that i'm not able to say to anyone. sometimes not even to nad. kool... let's see...my family came 3 weeks ago. dah balik dah pun. so, as expected i pun cuti 3 weeks. sepatutnye 2 weeks je but wat the hell..bukannye slalu pun buat dajal..hehe.. i was tired pun after the night out. went to GC concert with luqman n azzam (no, they're not my guy frens .they're my bros) and nad gak. kinda like a birthday present for him. although he paid for it. well, i paid for the tickets la but after dah kira hutang and langsai kan...nemmain.. nway, the concert was awesome. sugarcult did the opening and they were as good as GC. best gile.. totally worth it. and nad was supposed to go bakc on that thursday but ended up staying till saturday. siap bonding lagi ngan my mom. siap kutuk i lagi..kureng assem betul.. went shopping almost every day after that. kalau tak pun window shopping. harrods sale was crazeee...some women broke the door so kitorang pun masuk lambat. mom decided not to queue up for gucci coz they were so many ppl you wuld not believe it. managed to get soem beautiful CD jewelleries. murah je.. we went to the boutique jugak. 200 ppl were there, and they couldn't control the crowd so the firemen and policemen were there to sort things out. gile... but it was a nice day coz london snowed that day. haha...best... sket je though.. they went back last friday. sad. i actually cried, which is like probably the first time i cried kat airport. pathetic kan? sigh...went back to soton the same day. didn't stay in london with my uncle n aunt. just a thing i do to control my emotion. dunno... hmmmm..................waaahhh.....kena start buat keje..esok...sob...i wanna win 10 million pounds and live in a mansion and not have to do a
