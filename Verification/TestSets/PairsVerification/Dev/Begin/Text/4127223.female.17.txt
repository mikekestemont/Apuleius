Wasting time and money, great summer, oh yah!     So yesterday was like...nothing. i sat around, and tried to do algebra ratios for an hour. that was really productive. i got like two phone calls. dustin- wanting to do something, but called too late and it wasn't worth it. breanne- on ericks phone, wanting me to come to the wedding dance, but i said i wanted to sit at home, and i wouldn't even drive in there anyways like they wanted me to.      that made me think, does erick do shit behind my back?? like go out, and drink, and flirt w/ girls??? probably.       yep, so then i just sat at home. and today, me and brooke tanned. i talked to kara. and me and brooke went to town, got some pizza, bought me a belt and a new purse. its so cute, its cordorouy w/ stars printed w/ the cordorouy somehow and brown, and made by dickies. so its perfect for fall. i give it **** four stars!! lol. ...i think we went to town, just to go to town, woo. oh, and i bought like ALL the chocolate de vanilla chupa chups, and ALL the flan de vanilla chupa chups. YUM YUM. i'll probably eat them all today too.      but jeez, i hope i see erick today.... otherwise i feel like a waste of time gettin up and dressed.
This may be who I am...     last nite, i as i was trying to sleep, i was thinkin allot about myself... about what makes me up mentally, pyschically, and everything in between. so now i think i better express that, before i forget everything i put allot of thought into. which i will be expressing, in none other than ramblings...and i would never have it any other way.      x)im proud im lutheran, i don't know why. i was raised it, but compare it to other christian religions it seems more moderate and easy going...not strict and crazy sounding. heaven is a gift from jesus, accept it...thats all u have to do to be a lutheran.   x)im addicted to sugar, not beer or malt liqour, marijuana, or cigarettes like other kids my age. i would rather be on the internet, and have a lollipop or something large and sugary. i think its pretty sad, because it never does cross anyones mind...but, im always buy stupid sugary shit like liquid lollipops, giant pixie sticks, and sugar babies. im amazed im not fat, hopefully i won't be fat because of it...but i think i need help.   x)i hate listening about peoples mental disorders. thats why im not taking psychology. if you read anything about mental disorders, or crap like that, then you start seeing everyone as a disorder statistic or something....i don't think thats a healthy way to look at people, seeing they are individuals and not a scientific classification.   x)i drive away my friends. i tell them i don't want to do anything- when i do, i tell them i'll call them-which i know i won't have time to, or want to. or, i
