Okay, not really "exciting", but eventful in that I didn't do anything that I usually do. On Sunday I went to the Renaissance festival in Fairburn. That was a wonderful day of escapism, and I bought some really cute stuff. :-) All week my schedule at work has been wonky, but the shifts aren't that bad and I've actually been enjoying myself most of the time. It's totally twilight zone to be sure.  For the past two days I've been preparing to go on vacation by revamping my wardrobe :-D, which is very fun. Shopping relieves stress. Try it if you don't believe me. The only problem is that you end up spending lots of money. Fortunately, I rationalize spending so much on clothes by seeing it as an investment. That makes me feel better and gives me a chance to truly appreciate my job, without which I would be broke and couldn't make "investments". ;-)  All in all, I'm looking forward to work today. I'm looking forward to vacation tomorrow even though the Friday exodus will be brutal. It's a 9 hour drive to the place that we're staying, so the trip will be broken up into like 4 or 5 hours on Friday afternoon and the rest of the way Saturday morning with a stop at (hopefully) a nice motel. I so can't wait to see the ocean and walk on the beach. It's been several years since the last time I went on this little family gathering.
I should never have cut my hair short in the first place. Now I'm miserable because I can't do anything with it and it looks awful. Hair gel helps, but that's only because I'd rather my hair look bad all day than look bad until a breath of wind catches it and makes it look terrible.  So what can I do? Well, I can get an expensive styling and hope for the best, but the last time I did that it didn't work out well. I could cut it REALLY short, but that would still look bad; it would just be easier to maintain. Or I could just give up and let it look awful until it's long enough to tie back again. For now I'm going with the third choice, but I wouldn't be surprised if in a spat of frustration I went and shaved my head. Then at least I could get looks of sympathy from people who think I have cancer...  Maybe I'll just wear a hat for the next year or so.
I think that people must all be on vacation or something. www.cprogramming.com is dead except for a few ongoing threads where the original poster refuses to "get it". IRC isn't hopping much either. I don't feel like programming anything, so I'm pretty much stuck surfing the web trying to find something to do.  What about my friends? Well, they all work during the day, and my shifts are usually at night. Today was my day off, so I just went to the bookstore, had lunch and w
