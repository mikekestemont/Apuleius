&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In completing my position and research paper, I should be drawing on the work of other writers, this is the part when I must document their contributions. Which disciplines should I use?. APA or MLA?.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever it is I must make sure that I follow these 3 rules.   1.The sources is introduced by a signal phrase that names its author.  2.The material being cited is followed by a page number in parentheses.  3.At the end of the paper, a list of works cited gives complete publishing information about the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; source.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All those three rules are very useful, especially for my research paper...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I am concentrating on my introduction, I think it is important to establish my own voice in the introduction.My opening paragraphs should introduce me as a writer as well as my ideas to the reader.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One or two paragraphs are usually enough introduction for most paper in this course. I am sure, most readers do not want a great deal of background -&nbsp; they want to get right to the point.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am hoping that by stating the thesis and showing its importance, an introduction should hook readers.Or should I use a kind of&nbsp;strategies &nbsp;that to pose a puzzling problem to connect my topic to the reader.... all these my be taken into consideration in writing an introduction for position and research paper. I am working on it.....
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now,I am on the stage of drafting my position paper as well as my research paper...   With restricted thesis, a preliminary outline and plenty of notes, I am ready to write my first draft.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I am doing right now is to keep it rough and keep it moving. I do not let my wish for perfect sentences stall me at this stage.From the ideas and supporting details, I will polish my sentences later. By writing rapidly, I think it might produces a more natural,individual voice and helps to avoid echoing the language of my sources.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing for sure, a chatty, breezy voice is usually not welcome in this academic papers.  As though I believe in my main point and are interested in my subject, I will try to communicate that sense of conviction.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last semester, we were doing a proposal paper for Prof.Kay course.... she did mentioned about primary and secondary sources.According to Prof.Kay, primary source is more reliable than a secondary source because it has the advantage of being a firsthand account.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In carrying out the task given either in position or research paper, I have to read with a 'critical eye'.I have to&nbsp;examine the assumptions, assessing its evidence and weighing its conclusions.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ssometimes I came across some elements of argument and encounter experts who disagree with the sources I found. Here I have to read the sources arguments with special care and testing them with my own critical intelligence....now my note taking skills came in. In order to make life easier, I have to take notes as I read because it will help me to remember l
