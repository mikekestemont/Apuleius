hola all,    last night, i went into boston to "see" the red hot chili peppers play at one of the DNC parties. unfortunately, the stage was blocked from the street and we couldn't see anything, but we chilled on newbury street and listened to one heck of a rock show. anthony keidis and company played an awesome set even though they left out my fave ("under the bridge")! didn't really see to many celebrities. saw a couple of people who looked like they were important.     i've been on vacation this week. it's been nice having nothing to do! and i finally had time to clear some stuff up with school - i am now officially a full-time student! :-) and i just got my registration information from the school of public health. i have to choose whether i want to take epidemiology or essentials of public health law - fun stuff! :-)    poor donna! hope your day got a lot better after that incident! at least no one (especially you) was hurt! oh, and i have been to newport, but only for work. it's a beautiful place to visit and i would love to get down there one of these days for non-work related reasons - i will actually be there on monday all day for meetings and interviews for work. (very exciting stuff). i'll pump some of the people i have to interview for places to visit in the area. i'll let you know if i find out anything interesting for ya!    all righty, it's time to hit the hay! it's exhausting living this life of leisure ;-) too bad it's back to the grind on monday...have a great weekend everyone!!!
awwww poor Donna! :-( :-( :-( Don't worry about it; happens to everybody! Everything will work out okay. i love you! :-)
Today was going so well.&nbsp; I didn't oversleep.&nbsp; I hit no traffic on the way to work.&nbsp; The weather was beautiful.&nbsp; AND THEN...as I'm getting off the LIE at exit 49 S, it happens.&nbsp; I roll into a minivan.&nbsp; BAM!&nbsp; Just like that, I have become a statistic.&nbsp; I've never gotten into an accident before.&nbsp; The woman who was driving the minivan was stupid.&nbsp; She didn't roll down the window to talk to me.&nbsp; She just sat there and talked on her cell phone and CB radio, even though I was standing in front of her and waving for her to roll down the goddamn window.&nbsp; CB radio??? That's odd, thought I.&nbsp; I thought she might be some kind of work carpool service, because she had 3 non-related looking people in the van.&nbsp; Then I notice it - little writing on the side of the minivan - Helpers Assisting the Mentally Retarded.&nbsp; YEP, you guessed it!&nbsp; I hit a bunch of retarded people.&nbsp; LOVELY, the day is just getting better.&nbsp; So, she calls the cops, because its protocol, even though this is just a stupid little fender-bender, and my car was absolutely fine.&nbsp; Apparently, after waiting an hour, she realizes that she told the cops the wrong intersection.&nbsp; O
