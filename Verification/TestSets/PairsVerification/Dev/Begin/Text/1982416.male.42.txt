Sallie McFague's Speaking in Parables - as published by SCM in 2002&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     In "Speaking in Parables", McFague lays out an approach for intermediary or parabolic theology: theology which relies on various literary forms – parables, stories, poems, confessions – as a way from religious experience to systematic theology. McFague brings a commitment to bringing the Word to life for ordinary people, grounded in a existential, personal and sensuous reflection on life.  McFague refers often to poetry (Gerard Manley Hopkins), stories (Tolkien) and parables (such as those written by Kavka).   McFague reminds the theologian that metaphor and symbol should be used as food for thought – contemplated, probed, reflected upon, rather than manipulated, translated and reduced. Theologians, she says, need to learn to express insights in autobiography as much as in systematic propositions.   urlLink Speaking in Parables  has recently been republished by SCM, 2002, but the 1975 version is also available online at Religion Online:  urlLink Speaking in Parables: A Study in Metaphor and Theology: Online   McFague's later books include:  urlLink Metaphorical Theology: Models of God  (1997),  urlLink The Body of God: An Ecological Theology  (1993), and  urlLink Super, Natural Christians: How we should love nature  (1997).

When you hear the phrase "theological reflection" it is usually applied to to theological students in the context of field education. Yet most people writing about theological reflection expect that the predominant context will be groups of people in congregational settings working together to make sense of their lives. So why do we expect the professional theologians to talk theology while everyone else just 'does it'? James Hopewell, before his death in 1984, challenged his peers in theological education circles to think beyond clericalism. Seminaries needed to think beyond the formation and equipping of ordained ministers. When working through the stories, symbols and meanings of ministry experience, groups should be considering not just individuals, but whole congregations.  Hopewell distributed the draft of an essay to his colleagues in 1983 - proposing that the new paradigm of theological education should be the development of the life and faith of the congregation. His research was published in more detail after his death in the book " urlLink Congregations: Stories and Structures ", edited by Barbara Wheeler in 1987. The essay was responded to by his colleagues in another book, " urlLink Beyond Clericalism: The Congregation as a Focus for Theological Education ", edited by Barbara Wheeler and Joseph Hough in 1988. Barbara Wheeler and Edward Farley continued the conversation in the collation of essays: " urlLink Shifting Boundaries: Contextual Approaches t
