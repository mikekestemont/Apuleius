I seriously need to learn how to play the game of love better. Or I need to learn how to play hard to get. It seems that if I like someone, I'm honest about my feeling. But I guess guys don't like that. So from now on, I will not be calling any guys after we make out or any such thing. Chris hasn't called me in 2 days. I'm kind of upset about it. I just don't get it. He told me I was his dream girl. I swear that line was just to kiss me. But I told him that I wanted to date him because I feel like a slut just making out with him all the time. So I kind of have a feeling he isn't calling me is because he doesn't have any money to take me on a date so he's just avoiding the whole situation. He is making me so angry. Well, I'm moving on. I'm keeping my options open. I don't want to loose out on any good opportunites. Plus my cousin Hannah is coming tomorrow to stay with me for the whole long weekend. I'm so excited to see her. So I'll make myself busy so I won't hang out with Chris when he comes crawling back. I can play these games too!! I went to institute tonight and it was so good. I learn so much about the church and the scriptures when I go. I feel so good when I'm there. It's awesome. I need to make more mormon friends. I feel like I'm getting a lot, but there always room for more. I like living in Long Beach. It has been the best decision I have made in a long time. I'm happy here. Ok, talk to you later.
Well, today is Sunday and I really should be getting ready for church but I feel like procrastinating. I'm actually hungry right now and should get some breakfast. Ok, well Chris called me on Friday but we couldn't hang out because we both had different plans, but he ended up coming over late at night and we ended up making out. It was really, really fun. I'm not sure how much I like him, but I like kissing him. So that should mean something, right? He's actually really cool and down to earth. He's kind of had a crazy life, but he turned out surprisingly normal. So, on Saturday, I went to Disneyland with Mandy because work got us free tickets, and I was so tired. Then I came home, took a nap, and then got ready for my date with Layne. He's a super nice guy, I don't think my type. But we had a crazy night together because all these crazy things started to happen. Anyways, it actually turned out to be really fun and we had a good time. I seriously doubt he'll ask me out again. I think I am too wild for him. Which is ok, because he needs someone better than me. He wants t
