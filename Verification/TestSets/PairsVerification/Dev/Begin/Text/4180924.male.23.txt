Just as I suspected, I didn't sleep very much last night. I finally dozed off at about 3 and woke up at 7:42. Good times.  I am, however, feeling much better about life this morning. I don't feel like I need to be  urlLink shipped off  to  urlLink Milledgeville  and I'm actually in a pretty decent mood.
