My baby is home and that makes me a happy duck. He got home sunday, but that day was a mixed blessing...I had to work for three and a half hours, which wasn't that bad. Then, I went home and got changed and "asked" if I could go it was really a retorhical question because I was going to go to his house either way I just figured I would be nice about it considering I wasn't going to be home this entire week.&nbsp; So, I'm on my way to his house...about halfway there...and I hear this *thwump thwump thwump* from my tire and I started to lose control so I pulled over to the side of the road with a blown out tire and called Mathew. He came and rescued me because he is my Knight in Shining Armor. blah blah blah, I never made it to Mathew's house...I was still happy that he was home though and so that made everything better.  Yesterday we went and got a new tire for my car and then went to the company picnic and pretended to care.&nbsp; Then we went to his house and hung out for awhile, went and rented Bourne Identity, because we were gonna go see Bourne Supremacy....Which was all really entertaining, I enjoyed it greatly even though I didn't get home until 12:00....and slept until 11 in the morning.&nbsp;   Now, I am again with Mathew, in his room....but I so totally win because I have his laptop and I made a fort...yea baby. Mum just called me and was whining about not seeing me because I'm spending all my time with Mat. I told her welcome to my world because I didn't see her hardly at all this past couple weeks because we were both working. Then I asked her if she would go to the fair with me and she said that she didn't know, so I said deal with it because I'm not going to be home this week, she said get home tonight and talk to her or I have to spend all day tomorrow home...which doesn't make any sense because it wouldn't solve the problem but only make it worse....whatever. I still win, I have a fort. Groovy Baby.  The fair starts tomorrow, and I think I want to go...then I want to go to the new pool at Eagle Crest, that should be fun...but yea, more later. I'm going to become busy soon.  Fucking Kangaroos *scribbles them out*  Ciao~
It is again, unnaturally hot in Sunny Central Oregon....Which sucks because I don't feel like going anywhere or doing anything...though I may make cookies later just because I have an odd craving for chocolate cookie dough which I believe was brought on by talking to my dear Whitters who was making a cake for fair.  I entered a contest the other day....at 2424milk.com, where you enter the UPC of milk products and are entered to win a Volkswagon bug convertable...they are giving one away once a day for 24 days. I thought it would b
