urlLink    When I was little I remember seeing  urlLink Lone Justice  on SNL and falling in love with  urlLink Maria McKee . I wanted to grow up to be on TV wearing a pretty dress and wailing my head off. Over the years, after the demise of LJ, Mckee went solo and scored massive critical acclaim, if not much in the sales department, with  urlLink You Gotta Sin To Get Saved , a country-rock classic. After releasing the more guitar driven  urlLink Life is Sweet  in 1996, McKee took a break from the music business as she struggled to become independent of record label interference. She kept busy by singing on other people's albums, including the haunting  Sullivan Street  from   urlLink Counting Crows  debut,  urlLink August and Everything After . At the end of last year she released  urlLink High Dive  and a new era of her musical expression was launched.   BONUS:  Lone Justice's  urlLink  Drugstore Cowboy    urlLink
urlLink    Well, do we see a theme evolving here? I really like songs that are reworked and lose all resemblance to the original. I never listened to  urlLink Black Sabbath  and used to whine and cry every time my ex-boyfriend would blast them in our apartment. To his sheer pleasure, when I purchased  urlLink First Band On The Moon  in 1996, he gloated for months that I was not aware that this was a cover by the aforementioned band. But that's ok, he also listened to  urlLink Phish  and that was a good enough reason to give him the boot.    urlLink
urlLink    The first time I heard  urlLink Interpol  I just wasn't that impressed. In preparation for the Curiosa Festival, I picked up  urlLink Turn On The Bright Lights  and this song has hooked me. I can certainly hear the  urlLink new wave  influence all over this record. You know, there's this whole derivative argument about musicians these days, but you know what? At the risk of sounding unsophisticated, I like hearing the evolution and the influence of other bands. It reminds me of stuff I used to listen to and why I liked it in the first place.   urlLink
urlLink    I'm having a very mild freakout over this song. I have been waiting patiently for the new  urlLink Fiona Apple  record for quite some time, but alas, it sits finished on the shelf at Sony because there seems to be some confusion on how to market it. Fiona isn't for everyone, I know, but those that do connect with her are extremely devoted. If the record company is nervous about recouping the cost of the album they could at least release it as a download only for the fans. I think that they would be pleasantly surprised in the sales department as Fiona's cult status has only grown while she's been away. The album was produced by the always brilliant  urlLink Jon Brion  who has been behind the controls of some  urlLink freakishly good albums .
