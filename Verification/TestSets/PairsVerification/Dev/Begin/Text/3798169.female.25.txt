You may be wondering what I was doing this morning at 1 am posting a link to some blog about some people moving to an apartment in Australia.  The answer is... I don't know!  Well, I was not feeling well, and didn't feel much like sleeping. So, I was awake and wandering the internet in and out of blogg-dom.  I came across this blog that I found interesting so I posted it on my own blog.  It is kind of interesting looking at people's blogs.  It's kind of like high tech people watching.  And it is amazing that people will just let you into their lives like that... to follow what they are doing.  I wonder if anyone is doing the same to me?  It's fascinating isn't it?

I have this urge to get to know my neighbors.  They are all in some way, shape or form going through some sort of a crisis.  These people are my friends and acquaintances, but I feel like I need to pour myself into them.  Actually I feel the need to pour Jesus' love out on them.    What do I mean by that?    We know some of them better than others.  Some we have over for coffee, or we will go and visit every now and then, but I think we need to go deeper.

The memorial service for my little friend Cameron ( urlLink who I wrote about last week ) was yesterday afternoon.  Aside from my own father's funeral, this was probably the most difficult one I have been to.    There was a very moving photo and music presentation honoring Cameron's life, and his father Chris gave a eulogy that was probably the most beautiful and eloquent I have ever heard.  We will miss Cameron so much.  My oldest daughter is about his age. My wife teaches his Sunday School class, and we consider their family so close to our own. These will be hard days ahead.  But... We are looking forward to the day when we will see him in heaven and be there for the joyful reunion. That is our hope in times like these.  Again, please make sure you take the time today to let someone you love know that you care about them.  Grab hold of these opportunities before they pass you by.
urlLink   Last summer I picked up a pretty fun hobbie called  urlLink geocaching .  Basically, it involves using a GPS to locate a certain location in which a treasure is hidden.  It's high-tech treasure hunting. I like it because it gets me out to places I would never have found on my own. Seems like the type of sport you really enjoy, or think is a waste of time, but if you have a GPS, I would r
