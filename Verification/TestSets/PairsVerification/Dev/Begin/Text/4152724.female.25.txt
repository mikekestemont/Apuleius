AGH!!! Why do people have to do drugs? I just don't understand. Ok we have another kid in and this time for possession of cds. She's asking us a million questions and we don't know the answers to. I'm sitting here listening to this girl talking to my partner and he's trying to calm her down by answering her questions. Ok I've been here almost thirty minutes and she is already bugging along with my partner. Please people be quiet. I'm thinking please stop talking to her and making her worse and let her sleep. Please girl go to sleep.
Well I'm back at work and really didn't want to come today. The kid we had in lastnight  finally left this morning. I'm just sitting here at being bored yet again. My partner is watching the news on t.v. I'm hoping he doesn't bug me today. Tonight is the first scrimmage for football, so hopefully the kids will be good. School starts Thursday so this weekend is the last before school starts. Jason's aunt and uncle head back to San Antonio tomorrow morning. I got to see them Wednesday evening. Man I really don't have much to say makes me seems pretty boring lol. Guess I'll surf the net and some message boards, and maybe write some more later if I can think of anything to say lol.
Geez this is really bugging me, my partner that is. So we have a kid in and he's here sitting in the room with me bugging me. Can't he take the hint that I'm not listening to him. I'm on the computer trying to stay entertained and not pay attention to him? He was asking stupid questions again to coworkers agh!!!! Man does he ever make me look stupid in front of people. Don't get me wrong he's a nice guy but man oh man does he ever bug me. I'd better end before I get too worked up about this lol.
OMG my partner at work is driving me crazy! Why can't he be normal? Why does he ask me such stupid questions? Why does he freak whne the word"juvenile" is mentioned on the radio? AGH!!!!!!!!!!! I keep thinking to myself it'll be ok. It's pretty bad when ShaClair and Jason want out of here so fast, but yet I have to work the whole eight hours with him. I don't dare ask him something or it'll end up in an half to hour long speech. Sometimes I don't understand why people are the way they are. I'm not trying to judge but is he really that ignorant? When I work with him I feel way cool and normal, but if he goes and asks an officer or another employee a question it makes me look dumb. He asks the most stupidist questions. HELP!!!!!!!! I'll update in a bit more on the day.
Today went pretty well. Jason and I went to give blood. We came back and I took a nap. Guess I was tired cause I slept for a couple of hours. I c
