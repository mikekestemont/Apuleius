I stumbled upon SP2 quite by accident, and was lucky enough that our dearest Heidi had decided not to limit the number of participants. Had she done so, there would have been no way for me to get in... and I feel sorry for the people that didn't know about it and didn't get signed up by the deadline. After exchanging a couple emails, I decided that I would like to host Secret Pals III. This blog is designed specifically for SP III... any comments, updates, etc are going to be posted to this blog. Please link back to this blog and check in from time to time. If you send me a comment with your blog name, etc I will link to your blog as well. If you'd like to get to know me a little better, my regular blog is  urlLink here.    Please read ALL the rules before you agree to participate!     Who is this for?    This swap is for crocheters and knitters. The  only real requirement is that you have a website or a blog. I state this preference that way the person who is your pal can look at your site and get a general idea of your likes & dislikes, etc. There will also be a WebRing set up for SP III, and all members need to join the ring with their blogs or websites and include a valid, active code on their websites. If you need help inserting the code when it is given to you, please email me. If I can't help you, I will find someone who can.  International Secret Pals are welcome to participate!

There are no guarantees that other people in your country will sign up, so if you are an international pal, you may have to pay international postage. Please keep that in mind when you sign up.    Timelines and Due Dates    SP III will run for  three months , starting from after  September 4th, 2004 and running until December 4th, 2004 . The reason for this is so that people will not have to worry about sending things over the holidays.   Signups  will be from August 8th to August 27th, and signups will *end* at midnight Central Standard Time. I will not take signups before August 8th or after August 27th.    Matches  will be distributed by September 4th, 2004. Please make sure that my email address,  Vidardottir @ cox dot net  is approved for your mailbox, so the matches will not end up in the spam filters.    Rules     Minimum Contribution  is $50 in U.S. dollars over the course of those three months. To quote Heidi, "This can include the value of your time if you make something, and it can also include any postage costs. Why did I set a minimum contribution level, you ask? Because some people in the first Secret Pal felt they had given gifts that were much more valuable than what they received in return. Establishing this a
