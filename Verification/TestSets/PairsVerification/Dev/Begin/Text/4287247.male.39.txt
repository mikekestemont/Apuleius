I had my first Lap Dance tonight.  I'm not sure why tonight except that I'm staying with my grandmother while I'm visiting my family.  When I do that I generally go to some local video booths at night a couple of times a week.  If you don't know what that is that's where you go to these itty bitty booths, one chair per booth only slightly larger than a phone booth.  In each booth is a TV showing porn on 4 to 100 channels depending on the place.  You get in, lock the door, put in some money and whack off.  If you think that's strange or perverted first I'll point out that most sex advice columns like in Time Magazine or MSNBC.com or Glamour or Cosmo will tell you if you don't masterbate, you're the weird one not me.  And second since I'm at my grandmother's it's not that convienent to do it at home.  Anyway, with that situation and also feeling like I said before in so much need of physical contact I decided to stop by a strip club and get a lap dance.  It's taking me many years to get up to this point.  I'm in my mid 30s and this was my first time and only my 3rd time to a strip club.

At the other two I guess there were not so many girls and too many guys so the girls didn't have to work at it to get a customer.  I turned down the first couple of girls.  I was trembling and my hands were freezing and I was hoping to get calmed down and my hands warmed before I went for it but the 3rd or 4th girl that asked was fairly agressive and good looking, closer to my type than most.  She sat down on my lap and asked me several times.  I declined a couple of times but she wore me down and so I said yes.  I know that every club is different and each city, county, country has different laws and this being my first I wasn't sure what I could and couldn't do or where it would lead.  This place had semi private booths around the room which was nice so didn't think about people looking on.  I told the girl I was a lap dance virgin.  She didn't say anything so I'm not sure if she didn't hear or thought "they always say that" or what.  Anyway she started by climbing on my lap her back to mine and reached behind her and massaged me thought my pants.  Then she got off and pushed her ass in my crotch and g
