I have been so lazy the last couple of days and I am not sure why. My insomnia has returned and I have beenup until 2:00-3:00am, that may be playing a part. At least I don't have things scheduled that it is fouling up.     &nbsp;   Leah & I got the walls sanded in the bathroom on Saturday. I decided I want to replace the entire wall by Michaels sink. Its just been rigged too many times to get it to look nice so why not just get a piece of drywall and replace the whole thing. Today I am going to get the trim for the corners cut glued and hung. I am still planning on getting the painting dome this week.     &nbsp;   The boys went ot the Bike show in Carlisle this weekend. They had a blast and It was good for them to get out and bond a bit. They got back late though and missed church so just Leah & I went. We talked about Gideon. What a scardy cat he was but knowing God is on your side you can do anything.     &nbsp;   Um... I cant'think of much else to post. My stomach has been acting up as well here of late. Perhaps something (illness) is brewing and that's why I feel so off lately. Anyhow, that's all for now, CHOW     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;
WOW, where did this week go?     &nbsp;  I am just about done with prepping in the bathroom.The walls should get painted next week if all goes well. I got my shower curtain and liners in the mail already, just waiting on the rod & hooks yet. The curatin is going to match nice with the shade I picked out for the cabinets. I got the wires for the light fixtures rerouted yesterday and just a little more spackling and sanding to do.    &nbsp;  Not much happening this week . The kids were here on Wednesday and basically we had time to eat and watch a little TV and it was time to take them back home. We had stopped at Daddy's to give him a haircut so that ran us late.     &nbsp;  Yesterday after Michael cam home we form work we went to the bank to make a deposit and then to the grocery store. Chef Boy pizza for supper with hamburger and extra cheese, YUMMY! We basically sat around and watch the tube like the typical couch potatos we are. I can't even tell you what we watch.     &nbsp;  Seems to me my life has been rather boring this week.&nbsp;Perhaps next week will bring an adventure of some sort. That's all, Later :)
Ok so I am off to a poor start in writing daily entries. Perhaps I should just focus on writing regularly instead of daily.     &nbsp;   Sunday we got up and went to church then over to Daddy's for the day. Old friends came down for a visit from Hazelton. I believe Daddy really enjoyed their company, I did too. We took them for a drive to see the tornado damage a
