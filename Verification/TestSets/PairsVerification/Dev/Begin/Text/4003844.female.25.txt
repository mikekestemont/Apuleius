I feel like crap today. But you know what? I don't care! I have shit to do. So, anyway, this morning I dropped the jeep off to get Rhino lined. Which means that even if it rains the inside should never stink like rotting dead things again. Good deal. I hate that nasty smell. So, anyway, I feel like shit. More later.
Dear goddddddd, one more hour till I'm free from the sheer and utter misery of the prison called my worplace.......more commonly known as the depths of      hell   ........
Finally  urlLink Friday ! I thought the week was  never going to end ! Not that it hasn't been a semi-decent week but I'm so ready to relax. Okay, so first of all let me re-iterate that I have no idea what the hell my problem was this week. I find myself stressing out over   NOTHING  . Well, maybe not nothing, but things that usually wouldn't get me all worked up. I went and had my hair done yesterday at   Gino Venti's  . I'd have to say that Gino's is by far the best salon that I've ever been to. And Gino is just great. Every time I go I have to have him. Nothing like a strong  urlLink Italian  guy washing your hair! I think it has more to do with the strength of a man's hands really than it does him being Italian, or even attractive for that matter. Gino, if you ever read this (which you won't because you have better things to do with your life than read my pathetic carap), I don't think you're ugly so don't get all butt hurt. There,  six covered . But I think I am safe in assuming that he knows what he is doing.My hair always looks great when I walk out of there. Unlike   Chicky   at the last salon I went to who made me look like  urlLink Ronald McDonald . The worst part was that she made out like it was the Taj Mahal of hair stying. Too funny. And really annoying when I actually saw it outside in the daylight Eeeuck.  I am about to become the ultimate diet Nazi. I saw some pictures of myself and to be honest I really hated them. It's not that I don't like myself as a person, it's just that I   cannot stand   being overweight. It seriously depresses the  urlLink shit  out of me. I like taking care of myself, I like looking good and being well dressed. I think that I should go with the course of action listed in the Phys Fitness MCI. Sounds good to me. I am working on quitting smoking. I have seriously cut back. I just don't want to be 40 looking 80, plus it was making me feel like shit in the morning. I am going to go get my teeth bleached after I quit completely. (*  quitting plan not in effect from 05-00 hours beginning today, Friday the 13th. It is after all,  Martini Friday !Cheerth!)
