&nbsp;I went to watch a pratice at the high school today. I missed it while I was there. I miss performing and all that stuff but when I in my normal life I dont miss it. Do I want to do winterguard? Is this me just having a moment of craziness. Shouldnt I just focus on school my first year and get settled before I get all crazy and have myself divided in a million pieces again. I just finished with colorguard. Do I really want to start the whole thing all over again?? What do you think?

Hi everyone!   &nbsp;  This is my first blog...ever!!&nbsp; I'm not quite sure how I would like to utilize this experience though.&nbsp; Most of the people that know me&nbsp;would probably attest to the fact that I am the "keep it inside and work things out internally" type of person.&nbsp; I am sometimes envious of the people who can just get it out there and talk about shit.&nbsp; It takes some coaxing with me I guess...I have had 23 years of practice being internal, but I've been trying for a while to&nbsp;create new communication practices.&nbsp; When I was younger I tried to keep diaries and journals.&nbsp; Yeah...those never lasted.&nbsp; I&nbsp;tried recently&nbsp;to keep up with a journal of sorts, but I&nbsp;could never to commit to it.&nbsp; I'll try hard to keep up with this blog...I really love the idea of it.&nbsp; I love to hear peoples stories and maybe I'll post some of my own.&nbsp; For now I think I'll stick with random thoughts, freak-outs about my body, my lethargic attitudes towards exercise, some favorite poems and maybe some of my own.  &nbsp;  Until next time...take care  Jenna
I cannot wait until my Sundays are filled with fun things.  I long to be part of the culture that goes out to restaurants rather than serving those that go out to restaurants.  What, I ask you, is better than a 'free agent' Sunday?  I would say that lipgloss, pillow top mattresses, bubble baths, and beer and wings would be on the same place on my list as a 'free agent' Sunday.  I will tell you what does not top my list.  Early evening menus and bitter participants of the eating out community, that's what!  So supermodels, now is the time to schedule your Sunday time with me.  I know you are thinking to yourself, Jan, it is five months away until 'free agent' Sundays even begin.  Why do I need to book now?  I'll tell you why.  Because my mind is furiously thinking up ways to spend those very days...and I
