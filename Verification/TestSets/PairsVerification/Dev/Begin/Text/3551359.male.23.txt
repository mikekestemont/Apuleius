For the past months I've been participating in&nbsp;a masterclass about film criticism.&nbsp;The final college of this class took place yesterday, and afterwards&nbsp;I&nbsp;had&nbsp;a nice get-together with some fellow students. We&nbsp;had dinner together and&nbsp;some of us went to a couple of bars in Grooningen.&nbsp;I&nbsp;was one of the last to leave&nbsp;the bar at 05.00 'o clock, so I got home&nbsp;pretty late.
While searching for a birthday present for a friend of mine, I accidentally discovered that a dvd of  urlLink  Citizen Kane   (1941) has finally been released. My first screening of this movie took place fairly recently, during a college viewing in a movie theatre. I was immediately hooked by it's gloomy opening sequence. For some reason I am always a sucker for movies with a sinister atmosphere. Visually, 'Kane' is very stunning. It made a huge impression on me, so I wanted to buy it for my collection. Being a poor student, I didn't really have the money to purchase this classic. Of course I couldn't resist the temptation and so I delved into my savings to buy a copy, along with the last installment of the  Lord of the Rings  trilogy, which was also on my wishlist. This week I'll be watching 'Kane' for the second time. Hurray!
Here's the thing, I am a movie lover, and yes, that means that I'm a little obsessed with cinema. I have a habit of spending far too much of my money on dvd's. I even have this weird dream of directing my own movie one day. Besides this, I'm also a journalist. I studied&nbsp;for becoming one&nbsp;for five years.&nbsp;During this time, I worked parttime and freelance for&nbsp;a number of newspapers. These&nbsp;jobs&nbsp;were always great fun, but after I while writing about local farmer festivals and missing cows somehow wasn't wholly satisfying for me anymore. I would like to spend more time on research before I write my stories, and that's why I chose to study some more.&nbsp;I always liked movies, and so I decided to study Arts, Culture &amp; Media in Groningen. I focus on&nbsp;film sciences and I&nbsp;hope this will give me anough basic knowledge&nbsp;and expertise to become a movie journalist or maybe a film critic one day.&nbsp;In the mean time&nbsp;I've got&nbsp;to keep writing, so on this neat little website I'll try to keep a record of all my movie experiences. Oh, and I will probably also rave about my life, now and then.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's see how long I can keep this up...
I got tired of studying for all those tests I have next week,&nbsp;so I decided to take a pause to watch   urlLink Phone Booth   (2001). This movie couldn't have been released much later, because the cellular phone will probably have made phone boots obsolete in a year or two.  &nbsp;
Well, this is it. As of today, the shiny world of television is a no go zone for me. Why? Because the European soccer championship has started. For one month, every TV channel will broadcast matches, hours of boring soccer related television shows and endless bickering by semi knowledgeable soccer analysts. This is not something I want&nbsp;to s
