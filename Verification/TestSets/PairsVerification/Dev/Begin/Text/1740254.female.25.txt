i hate my life i hate my life i hate my life
i can't wait to have a party @ my new house!  are you all ready?!  anyway, those of you who are around here are gonna have to fess up about reading my blog and let me know if you want to come.  we close july 29 and i move in that weekend.  i'll probably need a week or 2 to unpack.  oh yeah, and to buy a grill.  lol.  anyone w/ a grill & a truck, feel free to bring yours!  oh, byob but i'll have a keg.
hold your horses!  it's thursday, i had to go visit ABC after work so i don't get home till later.  then i had to get together rent checks and bank and 401k statements... yeah, i got pre-approved this morning for the loan and the sellers accepted my offer!!  pray everything goes well @ the bank tomorrow RRM emailed me today.  i guess EAB called her to tell her i've been going through a lot of shit & w/ her quitting & all she wanted to make sure someone was there for me or something.  she's so sweet. so ABC is gonna write this letter to D for me kinda saying how i feel but i don't think i'm gonna let her send it.  i'm too scared...
so i put an offer down on a house today.  damn, and i thought shopping for the house was bad?!  just putting in an offer takes hours.  my agent called the selling agent tonite and she had just gotten another offer as well so she was going to try to present both of them to the seller tonite.  of course i have no clue what the other offer was.  i ended up being pre-approved for $3000 more than i thought and i can put down $1000 for closing so i got closer to asking price than i thought i would be able to.  average in that area is to sell at or slightly above asking price.  keep your fingers crossed.  i should know tonite or tomorrow.  the house is great but i'm not gonna go into it now.  not till i know cuz if i can't get it then it won't matter... elizabeth quit today.  i need her at work.  not a day goes by that i don't talk to her.  i can go to her w/ anything.  it's just one thing after another.  even ABC was saying today that i really have gone through a lot of big shit in a short period of time.  at least i don't feel like such a baby now.  sometimes it's hard to handle.  one at a time i could take. keep your fingers crossed for the house!!!!
i want to cut so bad and i haven't done that in so long and it's so hard to push those feelings away and i'm trying.  i swear, i'm trying...  i need...  fuck, i don't know what i need.  i need him.  how fucking pathetic is that.  i mean, yeah guys upset me, b
