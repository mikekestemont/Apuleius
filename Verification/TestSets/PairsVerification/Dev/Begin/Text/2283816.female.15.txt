Glinda sat on a stool in her room, sadly applying eyeliner. A small tear fell from her eye, and she muttered something as the violet smeared. Great Oz, she looked like a boxer now. No way to greet the people.   Why had things turned out the way they did?  She heard her window open, and then shut with a slam. Cautiously she peered into the mirror. It was Elphaba.  “ELPHIE!!” she cried, running to her and giving her a huge hug. “What in the world?”  “Lots of things, really,” Elphaba said. “First of all, the shoes. Sweetie, where the hell are my shoes?”  Glinda released her and squirmed nervously. “Well… Dorothy had them last”-  - “Yes, I know that,” the Witch said patiently.   “And then… erm… uh… we’re all pretty sure they got lost in the desert on her way back.” Glinda braced herself.   The Witch looked at her pleasantly. “Well, I’m sure you’ve already hired a team of trained professionals to go find them, haven’t you?”  Glinda took out a small cell phone and dialed. The Witch nodded and raised her eyes to the ceiling. She waited until Glinda finished her phone call. Then the Witch was gone, and Elphaba returned. “Next,” she said, “Fiyero is still alive.”  Glinda wasn’t entirely sure how to react to this news. “I’m … I’m happy for you,” she finally said softly.   “He’s a scarecrow.”  Glinda stared at her. “Oh, honey…”  “The last thing – what did you do with my bottle of green elixir and why do you want it?”  Glinda again looked uncomfortable. She could only whisper it into Elphaba’s ear.  “HOLY SHIT!! ARE YOU SERIOUS!?!?”  Glinda nodded.  Elphaba stormed around the room in utter disgust. “This is unbelievable,” she muttered. “Freaking unbelievable.” She looked up at Glinda. “Why did you take it?”  “I just wanted to see… see if it really was true… it was.”  “Do me a favor and don’t mention it again… ever… okay? That despicable piece of…” She continued to storm around. Glinda watched her friend burn off the steam. Then Elphaba turned around and began to cry.   Glinda put a comforting arm around her shoulders. “Elphie, calm down. You’ve had a rough day.”  Elphaba glared at her. “Oh, a rough day? What about a rough LIFE, Glinda, did that occur to you?” She sobbed some more, dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief to avoid her watery tears.  “Just… think about Fiyero.” Glinda was surprised at herself. She didn’t think she had it in her to be compassionate about it. But here she was.  Elphaba’s sobbing began to subside. “You’re absolutely right – I’m wasting my time standing here crying. Go, Glinda. Go tell the people about me. You’ll be late. I have to get going – come back to my castle after you’ve finished.” She headed for the window. She turned one last time. “And you might want to fix your eyeliner.”
Elphaba leaped out the window and headed back into the sky. She took one last look at Glinda standing in the window waving. Elphaba smirked. S
