Well, packing is actually getting finished and I think I can see the end to all of this in sight.  I had a great time with Gail today getting tummy shots.  We also had a very nice dinner tonight with Dr. Secor and his wife and are so excited to have their support in the upcomming months.  The mixture of emotions that I am feeling is nothing short of amazing.. excitement, fear, anticipation, worry, joy, gratefulness.
Seeing if I'm in.
Hi, just trying this out again.
Ok, if anyone has hints on how to make this better, please let us know!  Meanwhile, be patient while we learn.
Wow!  We finally found a name for this spot and decided to put this up!  We are so excited about using this to keep in touch with friends and to describe our adventures as we travel to Canada for 10 months to attend Augustine College.  Right now we are focusing our time on packing our apartment and getting everything to go.  Thanks for comming by and we look forward to sharing with you!
Praises   Thank you for prayers.  The downside to Dad's being retired is that money is a little tight for Mom to come visit baby & me this November.

Things are getting very busy now and I think our time here at Augustine College will give us enough to think about for our whole lives.

I apologize for not keeping up with the blog and we hope to be better in the future when things get rushed.  Ryan actually did begin a blog on Wednesday but still hasn't finished it so I may encourage him to do that when I am finished.  Then you'll be able to read about what we are learning in our science, medicine, and faith class.        We've spent the last couple weeks looking at the dawning of western culture and studying the contributions of the early Greeks.  The development of reason as we know it today began with the Greeks and even now influences the way we approach people, the world, and matters of Faith.  I wonder why God led the Greeks along the paths He did and planted his church among a bed of Greek thought.  Was He preparing a people who would desire truth so that they could accept Christ when he appeared?  I'm interested to see what we will find when we reach the time of the early church in our studies.  What parts of the Greek-Roman world and thought did they accept/acknowledge/incorporate and what things did they reject?  This also leads me to think about the approach of the Gospel in cultures which are not reason based.   How does the Word speak t
