urlLink    Don't Know When I'll Be Back Again&nbsp; urlLink     In Spring 2000, I started a record label called  Exotic Fever Records .  This above photograph is of the last projects I did.  This is a picture if the CD itself, and was quietly released in 2002.  Only quietly because Exotic Fever was still very young at the time and we didn't do much press or promo for it.  However, we had many up and coming, as well as, well established independent artists work on it.  It was sold through some major distributors on the independent level, but was still slow at moving, and out of only 2000, 800 are left now.  So I can save myself the time of typing I will just insert someone else's text about this compilation so that you may understand what this is:      "Catherine Lewis reports: Exotic Fever records has just released a 20-track compilation unwieldily titled Don't Know When I'll Be Back Again: A Compilation to Benefit American Veterans of the Vietnam War. This compilation, which was two years in the making, features Vietnam War-era songs passed through the jaded filters of today's indie-rock stars. Artists like Death Cab for Cutie, J Robbins (Burning Airlines/Jawbox), Q and Not U, and Ted Leo recorded songs by legends like Led Zeppelin, The Stooges, Jimi Hendrix, and Jefferson Airplane, in honor of Vietnam's veterans.   The star-studded compilation benefits the Vietnam Veterans of America (VVA), an organization which was founded in 1979. According to Bonnie "Deleted name out, you can easily find it" of Exotic Fever Records, the VVA's Benefits Program "provides free legal representation for veterans in front of the Department of Veterans Affairs, assisting them in getting the compensation they need and deserve from disabilities incurred in service."
