I'm totally taking a break from Blurty...I can't type anymore about my day on there...the memories hurt too much. So I'll juss do it here.  Yesterday was fun. I'm trying to think of what i did in the morning but nothing's comming to....I was prolly sleeping...nah wait i was....till like 1 o clock. Then I wondered about the place in which i call home till I found the phone to make human contact. Nicole was my first victim.   Nothing happened over the course of the next 3 hours. Around 4 tho (DANG IT I MISSED MEN IN TIGHTS!!!) my aunt picked me up and Nicole and I went to this concert thing at FBC. No one showed up till an hour after we got there and nicole and I juss spent our time being intimidated and quiet. When we first walked into the church there was this AWESOME band playing...they were ska I
