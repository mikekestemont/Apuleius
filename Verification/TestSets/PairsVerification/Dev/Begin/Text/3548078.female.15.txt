Tomorrow is friday which means only one more week left for Steubi! AHHH I can't wait. everything is going well so far...I get to see my grandparents tomorrow I already miss them hehehe. Also saturday I'm going to be out the whole day! I get to hang out with my boys Anthony and Drew. I love them so much! LOL My legs hurt and I'm super tired....I need my sleep I've been staying up talking on the phone too much and then I wake up at 6:00am that's not too healthy....but oh well. Anyway love you all!
Well today I did the usual. I'm getting better at guitar and the snare too. My fingers ache a lot though but I guess that will be my sacrifice LOL. Today we had gardening at the Nursing home. Mr. Comfort (yes that is his last name was so funny) lol he says he is God's gift to women lol. But anyway bingo was fun I guess though I got the giggle attacks in the middle of calling numbers so I started messing up and literally threw the mic to Steph so she could call the numbers that was funny. Saturday I'm going to six flags for a concert and stuff it will be so much fun! Anthony and Drew are going so I'm going with them and it will be so much fun I can't wait. Tomorrow is Fr. Benson's b-day and I hope I'll be able to go to his party. Anyway that's all for now my fingers hurt when I type...lol God Bless
Well my grandparents came from Mexico Saturday. They are so sweet! I love them so much. I'm learning how to play the guitar so far I know about 4 cords so I can play one song not well but I'll get there) No nails! OUCH it is very painful and I can't wait to get bloody fingers LOL. I guess I'm doing ok with the snare I could be doing a lot better and I spend too much time with my guitar shame on me. Anyway today was Stephanie's 1st day at the nursing home (she is a volunteer too)She loves it! That's great. Well anyway I better go now...l...I need to get some sleep haven't gotten much of that lately! God Bless.
