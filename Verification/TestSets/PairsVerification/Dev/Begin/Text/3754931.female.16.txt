Okay everyone unfortunately I will be unable to help this upcoming week. My dad has signed me up for some stupid church camp when I am clearly atheist and I don't want to go, but its all good. Just wanted to let you know. Freya out ja!
Since the audioblogger service is temporarily down, I will put down the chart here. I will use the audio service in the future, but since I can't now....  As of this time, the totals stand as follows: (users in alphabetical order) Aeri87: 350 coal, 11.7% Chaobreeder: 790 coal, 26.3% Freya 55: 124 coal, 4.1% Hydra22: 952 coal, 31.7%  Totals: 2216 coal, 73.9%
If you go to www.audioblogger.con you can sign up for a *free* service that allows you to blog, even when you can't go online. I might be using this to report a total ore count, but it might be helpful if you need to post a coal count, and don't feel like getting online. Thanks for reading!
Ok I currently have 57 coal in the bank and that is not including what I gave you earlier. I am once again lost in the world so as soon as someone can please help. I'll wonder aimlessly until someone helps or I find the coal site. Then I'll be okay, and by the way, the one time I spammed was I state a one time event. I don't plan on ever doing it again unless someone makes me angry. Which we all know is not very hard to do because I have a short fuse so don't mess with me. That is all. Freya out. :)
OK everyone, here's the basics. 1)  No spamming.  Once, on a forum, a member of a certain group I am involved with spammed. It was very annoying. Don't do it again *cough* Alyce *cough*. 2)  No foul language unless completely justified.  If you don't think it is 93.2% neccesary, don't use it. 3)  Post at least once on here every 2 weeks or get a pay cut.  4) When I post my Ore Count post (every 6 hrs.) post on the comments with your total. If you do not post on at least one of the Ore Counts per day, our orders may go out late.  When orders go out late, everyone gets a pay cut (myself included.) To accomodate this pay cut, I will spend the 5% cut on coal for the next orders. Please post on here with something to say or ask about. Note: If t
