Havent posted in a while... I know. I am starting on a new site: The Minus World. Dedicated to anomalies in video games. Some stuff that I have are Polybius, and the minus world. I will cover in depth the stuff presented. look for it soon!
MAINLY because my blog client hasn't been letting me log in. Ok, let me start off by saying that I am DONE with exams! WHEEEEHEEE!! Also, I have found a third for my band. Kick ass. Its great!!! My site is going through some issues, so if there's problems, don't complain. I know. well, Thats all for know. TTFNMF (the extra mf is for mother fuckers!)
Yeah! I found a drummer for my band... it's finally complete! MUAHAHAHAHAHA!
I am almost done with exams. Social Studies was really easy (yesterday) and Science was a bitch (today). Now all I have is math on monday. That shouldn't be too hard, seeing as I'm a math whiz and all. he he he, Shamless Bragging. SB. I leave you now with a link to one of my most favorite Flash Movies. http://www.uplink2k.com/library/cartoons/ah2.html Later.
Im getting an XBOX soon. My real job will be starting soon, as well... Just an update, fuckers!
I am still sorry that nothing exciting has been happening in my life for me to post :p. With all that said, I won't be updating until the 21, because I have exams un til then. Alright, CYA!
Sorry that I haven't updated in a few days. I've just been busy as hell. Good news though, My tk domain should be up by the end of the week. Im going to "release" it on friday. I'm Outtie
So, (this happened yesterday, but I will say today, bc its more natural to me) I found a used pen on the ground at school. It was pretty beat up, but I needed a pen, so I took it, and set it in my right pocket (my dominant side). I had used it often that day, and sitting, and getting up it exploded in my pocket. Wow. I was pissed. Not just because my pocket was/is dirty, but because, lo and behold, my iPod was in that pocket. I was soooo fuckin pissed. I screamed (literally) and attempted to clean my device. Well, ther was ink all over the fuckin thing! And that was a baaaaad Idea. It turns out that soapy water is BAD for electronic devices, even if it's just on the body. So, not realizing this, I proceeded to listen to it, and it was screwed up. I could barely get the track spinner to work, or whatever its fuckin called. so I reseted it, and it started to work a little bit more. Its still not in tip top, and it kinda looks like crap, but i have secured my investment. hallelujah! The moral of the story: Don't put an iPod in the same pocket as a pen or a magnet.
Woooh! My Downhill Battle Stickers came in the mail today! woo. I have a 100, when I wanted 50. A money issue. M
