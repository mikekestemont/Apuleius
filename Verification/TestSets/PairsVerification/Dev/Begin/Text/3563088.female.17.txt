I was talking to my Zia today and I was telling her about Daniel. She told me that she hasn't seen me so happy since before my dad passed away. She knows I'm usually pretty bubbly and happy but she said that now she can see that there's more of a reason in me to be that way. Diana said that she's never seen me so happy in a long time too. I know I am but it's weird for me to say that. But anyways, my Zia said something to me that made me stop and seriously think. She said that sometimes in life when we loose people, they're replaced in other ways, with other people. Now obviously nobody can ever replace my dad. But Daniel's the person that's brought me back to where I was somehow. I don't know how and I know that he has no idea that he's done that but the way he makes me feel has done it. I've been really happy always but I'm a little bit more, lately and it's because of him! I tend to blow things up a little bit. Realistically speaking he does make me happy and he is really important to me. I think the reason why he’s brought me back a little bit is because thinking about him has taken my mind off of thinking about the loss of my dad. I don’t really think about him a lot and sometimes I feel so terrible about that. When I go to bed at night and stare up at the ceiling I always feel so bad for not being able to pray and say thank you to God for everything and everyone in my life. After my dad died I didn’t lose faith in my religion, I just realized that life and death is more powerful than any faith. But since I decided that I kind of feel lost. If you have nothing to believe in who are you? My mom always shoves her beliefs in my face and tries to make sense of them. But how can I believe something that inside I just don’t believe. To me the bible is just a bunch of stories. Perhaps the people were real and maybe their intentions were purest of pure but instead of reading about how good it was I prefer to try to be good in my life. I don’t even know what good is. So really I’m talking bull right now. But there are so many questions and so many answers to those many questions. I don’t feel like going through my life undecided about things and confused about them too. Whenever I think about this stuff I aggravate myself so much.
12/04/04   Tonight I was on the phone until 4 am with my friend Ramin. He’s my best guy friend. I can’t imagine my life without him, I love him so much. We always have the best conversations and we always have so much fun together. I respect him so much. He’s never touched drugs and h
