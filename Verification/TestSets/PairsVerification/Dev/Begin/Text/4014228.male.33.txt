The night before Peekskill 16-and-under coach Windy Smythe got the opportunity to coach at the new Peekskill Stadium.  One night later, Friday, July 30, it was Andy Barresi, along with Billy Moran, who got the chance to coach at the jewel of Section 1 baseball fields and he was beaming.  “It’s great to be here,” said Barresi, after Peekskill’s 18-and-under WPBA squad defeated Kensico 4-3. “It’s just amazing how beautiful this field is and how the kids enjoyed it.   “This is the most beautiful park I’ve seen in a long time. Just look at it. I couldn’t ask for anything more. I’m glad the city finally got it done.”  The most important thing was that the kids played as a team and they played their hearts out, according to Barresi.   “There was no yelling or screaming,” Barresi said. “The kids just played the game. That’s the way the game should be played, the way they played it tonight.”  The field isn’t just a breakthrough for Peekskill baseball, it’s also a good thing for the County, according to Barresi.  “It brings in here all the other towns and cities,” Barresi said.  “They can play their games here for a nominal fee, I don’t know what it is. It’s great for the County of Westchester that you have a beautiful field like this. Hopefully other Counties and cities do the same thing as Peekskill did here.   “Just build a good facility so the kids can play and have somewhere to go.” A facility that the kids on the Peekskill squad are very appreciative to have, according to Barresi.  “The kids are ecstatic,” Barresi said. “Some feel they’ve been left out of other teams. In addition to kids from Peekskill, we also have kids from Ossining, Croton, Hen Hud and JFK. These kids love playing baseball here.”   Mike Sabini-914-582-8703-msabini@mail.com
The lights went on for the first time at the new Peekskill Stadium in the latter stages of Peekskill’s 18-and-under division contest against Kensico.  Peekskill pitcher Chris McClellan however was on right from the beginning of the Friday, July 30 Westchester Putnam Baseball Association contest.  McClellan pitched into the seventh inning, allowing just two earned runs and three walks while striking out four in Peekskill’s 4-3 win.  McClellan became the first Peekskill pitcher to win a game at Peekskill Stadium.  “Hopefully this can be a building block for the Peekskill baseball program,’ McClellan said.  McClellan was backed up by a superb relief performance by John Wenk. With Peekskill holding on to a 4-3 lead in the seventh, Wenk made a diving catch to get the first out, induced a foul out to first before recording a strikeout for the final out of the game.  Kensico jumped off to 1-0 lead in the first inning but Peekskill (4-11) came back with three runs in the third. Scoring for Peekskill was Mike Tepper, McClellan and Billy Gallagher, who scored on a Ralph Sedlmayer single.  Peekskill scored its other run in the sixth when Wenk started the inning with a single and stole second, moved to third on a
