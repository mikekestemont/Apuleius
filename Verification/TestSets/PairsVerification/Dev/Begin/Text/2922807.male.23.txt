This ushers a new start for me to read into my mind & intuitions. And as they say, "the most interesting thought is the one you tell someone close, and you never knew that you knew it." Will keep posting.
Value Education is where future is!  While surfing on the net I came across this website www.valueducation.com . Subsequently I thought is it where the future education lies atleast partly, if not totally? As the Kaliyuga enters its pinnacle, the moral degradation will become rampant.  Skills, talents & education will more or less standardize. Then the key differentiator will be the MQ (Morality Quotient). Even today in our day-to-day life we see less qualified (skillful) but highly ethical & high-moral professionals being preferred over highly qualified but with unfaithful traits. So to me it indicates sort of an opportunity. Simova Course Material has a brief mention about such careers as Moral Counselor & the likes. Overall, its in ones self-interest to inculcate high MQ in ourselves and the coming generation.
This time something on human existence. As I grew up, I was told, Almighty has laid down 4 four objects of human existence.  1. Dharma-Religion 2. Arth-Luxuries 3. Kama-Carnal Pleasures 4. Moksha-Salvation  Through our lives, we realise that for perfect happiness, these four has to be balanced. We actually, intentionally or otherwise, do strive for this. Let’s see;                    Religion, in Swami Vivekananda’s words, ‘is a way of life.’ With certain set of rules, liberties, responsibilities and goals. Remember, its just the journey and not the destination. Journey is more important than the destination, said the Father of the Nation. ‘Means means more than the end itself.’                     What we in our life in the Kaliyuga do is a updated version of religion. It’s not about doing any of the above. All of them are complimentary. As a smart, evolved human being we have found our ‘way of life’. We worship, pray, donate, do social work, regret our sins…& with each passing day we are finding newer ways around it. All the unethical things we do in our professional lives we try to set them off against a new found sutra called Practicality. Everything passes under this bridge. The trickle down effect of this is that we get untrue to ourselves, near ones and the ones we claim are of our belonging...to be continued
Here are some of the musings...ohhh...chalo let me say...these are a few thoughts that caught my attention in last few weeks of reading. So here's a part of it...!   * Believe everything, trust nothing. * Four evils, Ego, Envy, Greed & Ambition. * Important ‘E’s of life: Ethics, Excellence, Efficiency, Equity, Environment & Education (Life-Long Learning). * Compassion is the cardinal sin of modern life. It traps us in a game that we cant win. Ones we define ourselves in terms of others we lose the freedom to shape our lives. * Data-Information-Knowledge- Wisdom- Enlightenment- Salvation * People can’t be taught, they learn. People can’t be changed, they change when they are ready to change. * Excellence, Contribution & Meaning are t
