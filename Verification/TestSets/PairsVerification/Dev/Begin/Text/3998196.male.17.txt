Today SAM 29000 visited Cleveland bringing President Bush in from Grand Rapids. Greg and I got to the airport just in time to check it out and I managed to get quite a few pictures of the beautiful bird. After the presidential motor cade passed by and the roads re-opened, we went down to Northrop but ended up back behind the FedEx ramp by coincidence. We were following the new Independance Air truck driving around and ended up with about 40 other people lined up along the fence there. 29000 was parked just about 30 yards beyond the fence, stairs down, Air Force guys hanging around her. The storm clouds were gathering so I snapped a few pictures and off we went. Below I've included a small version of a picture I took today. Just after I took it the rain started to fall. I got lucky.  After seeing Air Force 1 Super Team Discovery went into action. The Tire Rescue Team, or TRT, chalked up another save. A Michellin Radial was saved from the weeds just before the heaviest rain of the month hit. God bless you, TRT!  Time for bed now. I gotta get up early so I'm able to sleep tomorrow night! Only a day till the Dulles trip! WOOT!
Today...was...sweet.&nbsp; It was time again for the annual trip to a Pirates game.&nbsp; My dad, Greg, Kait, and I all headed down to Pittsburgh for a day of airplanes, baseball, and food.&nbsp; We first stopped at Pittsburgh Int'l to watch some runway 32 arrivals.&nbsp; There is a  really  cool cemetary right under the approach path and just off the end of 32.&nbsp; Only problem was we were there&nbsp;not 5 minutes before a Moon Twshp. Police car showed up.&nbsp; He ran our plates and told us we had to leave.&nbsp; Fortunatly, he wasn't a bastard and he said we could go up the street a bit and I could take all the pictures I wanted there.&nbsp; The spot was in a driving range parking lot.&nbsp; It wasn't near as good as the cemetary, but I got some cool side-angle shots and it wasn't bad.&nbsp; At least we could stay around.&nbsp; After a short while we drove down through Moon past where my dad used to live.&nbsp; We also saw the US Airways Flight Training Center where all the sims are.&nbsp; I'm thinking I'm gunna ask for a tour of that facility some time.  At about 330 we got downtown...errr..."dahntahn."&nbsp; We were all hungry so, naturally, we went up the incline to the Grandview Restaurant.&nbsp; It's a really cool place with an awesome view of the city.&nbsp; The burgers are pretty good too!&nbsp; After being thoroughly stuffed, it was time to head down the incline to the boat dock.&nbsp; Just beyond the bottom of the Duquesne Incline is a large railroad track.&nbsp; I made several ozog related gestures but...much to my surprise... a car rolled past that I  swear &nbsp;Ozog spray painted on.&nbsp; It said "FAG POWER" in large letters with 2 male symbols interlocking.&nbsp; Maybe our good friend Bob h
