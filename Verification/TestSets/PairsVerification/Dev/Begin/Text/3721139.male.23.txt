Let's see, today I worked (been doing that a lot lately), and I'm planning on working through Friday, too.  On Saturday, though, I'm taking some friends to Austin for day of climbing at Reimer's Ranch, and swimming in the Pendernales.  The tree swing is awesome.  It'll be a great way to cool off in the afternoon when the sun is directly overhead.  I get to play climbing teacher again, but that doesn't bother me too much - I'm hoping to grow my pool of available climbing partners so that one day I can actually start progressing in the sport again.  I can't wait for  urlLink Misty  to get her harness off the slow boat from China.  She's got quite the body for climbing.    The rain's supposed to have stopped dumping in Austin this afternoon, so I'm sure it'll dry out quickly, but damn have we had a lot of rain.  Don't get me wrong, I love the rain (and I'm not ready for the blistering days of summer, thankyouverymuch), so I don't want it to go, but I also don't want it to come around so much.  On a whim, I tuned into an internet radio station streaming punk.  See, I usually listen to trance/techno/house, as do most of the people I know who write software for a living (commentary on  that  vocational adaptation I'll leave for another post), so it follows that I wasn't programming this afternoon...  and we'll leave it at that.    I ought to end this post right now, but the reggae station, "playin' mostly marley mon'", was definitely worth a mention.
Maybe you were wondering about the title of this blog.  See, I'm a huge fan of trance, techno, vocal trance, progressive trance, and house music. I stream  urlLink Digitally Imported  radio from the time I get to work in the morning till the time I go to sleep at night.  Now click  urlLink here .  Got it? Good.
I've seen enough failed promises from people on the Internet, saying that they'll do this or that - I mean, have you ever tried to work on an Open Source project?  urlLink Quod erat demonstrandum .  Anyway, someone I trust a whole lot says it's totally addicting, and a good idea.  So, I guess I'll try it out for a few days.  I figure, sure, I'm a bit of an exhibitionist, so this fits right in.  The great thing about exhibitionism is that you get your thrills even if no one sees you.  It's just that the opportunity was there.  So that's my way of saying, leave a comment if you want. Or not, no worries.  No promises though.
For anyone that happens upon this site, let it be known that I didn't  want  to start a blog so much as I wanted to post a comment to another Blogger's blog, but the registration process involved setting up my own blog.  So here it is.
Well we'll float on, good news is on the way.
Finally, I'm awake. I went out to Northgate last night with some friends, so yes, there was c
