...and told me I'd never be prettier than the man on the penny.  Just kidding! Hopefully my idea will work out.  (my idea--->) The group of us buddies from The Village can use this blog for keeping-in-touch purposes. Everyone can have their own username on this blog (I, as the executor, go me) and write their own postings for everyone to read. It could work out and be super cool. Good idea??  If you're interested, let me know and I can send you a 'member invitation' thingy so you can write postings.  Otherwise, you can just read and enjoy and leave anonymous, threatening comments (woo, feel the power).
So it's that day. That Friday the thirteenth day.  No bodily harm has been done to me thus far, and thankfully, by comparison, not much emotional scarring has occured.  And so it is now that I realize just how much work I have yet to do before school starts.  UGH kill it. Or me. Which ever is easier.  The laundry situation is under control, thanks to moi. Nonetheless, the lady of the house beckons me still to do her bidding.  I must depart whenceforth I came.
I have been promoted to administrator *twiddles thumbs*. I hope everyone feels the power of my tiny font now!
created a new blog (woot). i now feel like the most indecisive bastard in the world, simply because it took me 4 or more tries to create a satisfactory template. somebody shoot me please.      anyhow, this should be pretty damn cool. enjoy The Crazy.
I have invaded with my small tiny font... be afraid!  BE VERY VERY AFRAID!
It's a rare thing that I get so much sleep as to confuse reality with dreams, but it happened last night/today. This time the sandman left me with: A close friend of mine had been shot in the lip and I went to visit him at the hospital. I woke up really late and the first thing I thought of was to check the condition of this friend who had been shot. So when I told my mom I wanted to go back to the hospital this morning, she was obviously confused, and that in turn spawned an hour's worth of confusion and deliberation. (just for the record, my buddy's safe and sound *winks*)  I went running today, but not in the morning like I usually do. So it was extra tiring and extra unnerving since more people were alive at that hour. And I must have missed the memo that said runners=okay to stare at obnoxiously no matter how many death threats are put into your mailbox... or, rather... *ehm*  I also fiddled around on the piano today trying to teach myself some hymns for this old lady's funeral... not a very religious old broad, so as you can imagine, very tricky to choose death-y music for her funeral. She didn't have any family, and her friends are all dead...so I suppose it doesn't really matter what I play or sing...but I can't help but think about what my funeral is going to b
