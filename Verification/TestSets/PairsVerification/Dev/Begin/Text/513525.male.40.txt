Preparing my Libraries orientation for graduate computer science students, and found this fascinating article on  urlLink  ACM Queue  vol. 1, no. 4 - June 2003 - "How Much Storage is Enough?"  : "In 1999, the world produced about 1.5 exabytes of storable content (1018 bytes). This is 1.5 billion gigabytes, and is equivalent to about 250 megabytes for every man, woman, and child on earth. Printed documents of all kinds make up only .003 percent of the total. Magnetic storage is by far the largest medium for storing information and is the most rapidly growing, with shipped hard-drive capacity doubling every year. Magnetic storage is rapidly becoming the universal medium for information storage...Although the social impact of the Web has been phenomenal, about 500 times as much e-mail is being produced per year than Web pages. It appears that about 610 billion e-mails are sent per year, compared with 2.1 billion static Web pages. Even the yearly flow of Usenet news is more than three times the stock of Web pages. As Andrew Odlyzko puts it,  "Communication, not content, is the killer app."  "

Somebody slap me.

Well, I have been sucked into blogspace, and I may never return :-)
I listed my  urlLink Rainbow Lives Blog  with the  urlLink Blog Search Engine ,    urlLink Blogdex , and the  urlLink Eatonweb portal .
I also went merrily a-blog-hopping using the top 100 lists at  urlLink BlogStreet .  I'm discovering a world that I barely knew existed!
I could sit and watch  urlLink Geoblog  for an hour...it's somewhat mesmerizing when you realize that you're watching bloggers in real time, all over the world.
urlLink MemeFirst  reports that Chuck Palahniuk, the author of Fight Club, has come out to avoid being outed by Entertainment Weekly:
So Palahniuk, the author of Fight Club, went and audio-blogged a very angry message, talking about the EW writer's suicide attempt and generally coming out because he felt he had no choice in the wake of the publication of the article. (I can't seem to access that message any more: maybe Palahniuk is trying to crawl back into the closet.)
Palahniuk then received a lot of supportive messages â€“ if you consider death threats against the EW writer to be s
