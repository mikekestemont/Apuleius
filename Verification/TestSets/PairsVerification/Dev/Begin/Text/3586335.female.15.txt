When you find someone what do you think of him/her? Do you look at them and think only what they look like? Or  do you try to talk to them and get to know them? do you hide from them so they won't notice you? Or do you show off in front of them? you try to get them but you fail you want to  be with them so  bad that you would do anything just to be with him/her. You fail then you find someone new  but it's hard to tell that if they are true, you just want to hold them close and never let go like a person with money it burns a holes in his/her pockets. Love isn't true and sometimes it never last.

When I was a child I didn't really have many friends I was short, not that smart, shy, and didn't know anybody, or I didn't try to know anyone. I had a babysitter that I would call my best friend cause she was like a nanny to me she stayed with us and would comfort me when I was sad and hurt. My sisters where not really people that I wanted to look up to cause my sister Shannon would scare me and my sister Wendy was to busy with all her friends and boyfriends. When my babysitters boyfriend would come over in the morning we would go to McDonalds. When my babysitter had to leave i didn't know what to do. i had no friends and I felt like no one wanted me there. I just had no friends until i hit 3rd grade. Her name was Krista Talley and i will never forget her in my life.
