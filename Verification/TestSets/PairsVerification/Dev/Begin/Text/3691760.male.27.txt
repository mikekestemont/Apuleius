I'm such a twat. Well, at times anyway... I've started coming out of my shell a little bit over the last couple of days. Hee, it's strange actually, 'cos I've just read back through my little collection of blogs and if you don't know the situation I'm coming from, they make no sense at all! I'll explain soon enough, that is if you're really interested to stay tuned. We'll see... Anyway, moving swiftly and effortlessly back to my original thoughts... I had a great chat with one of the people I thought I had an issue with (my over active imagination working again, and there wasn't really an issue. Amazing how all those feelings and thoughts can suddenly just go. I now feel bad for feeling them. I wished I could explain to people how my thought processes work. I think half of the problem is that I spend way too much time on my own. I like being on my own a lot of the time, but it does give me time to think, and to fester and to deliberate on my own insecuriorities. There's still issues to discuss, this chap (I'm never going to name names on this) wants me and the other people involved to all go for a drink to put some issues to bed.

But needless to say, he'll be too busy, something will come up, "sorry dude" etc and it will be put off, or he'll have to go early when the conversation starts moving in a way he doesn't like. Friendships should be real, you should be able to handle the hard times and the good, and by the hard times I mean be able to handle the arguments and disagreements. That's what love breaks through, thats what sincerity can overcome... we shall see if the traits I thought this guy has actually exist, or he has been taking the piss out of my for the last two years...
I am drunk. Again. I'm such a contradiction. On the one hand I claim to be a Christian. On the other hand, I really like a drink, plus I smoke, plus I hate everyone I live with at the moment. I hate having all these feelings of anger and bitterness, then having to try and read my Bible, think back to what I believe and then try to love the people I want to hate... Man, it's hard. All I want to do is go downstairs and kick off, shout and scream, start a fight, have an argument and really tell people exactly what I think of them right now. However I can't. I bloody hate all this teaching of loving the people you d
