In case you have been living under a rock recently Apple's WWDC (World Wide Developers Conference) is starting tommorrow June 28, 2004.  Steve Jobs is planned to preview the newest version of OSX, Tiger.    It is also  urlLink rumored  that he will upgrade the LCD displays. If we are lucky we may see a G5 in an iMac or PowerBook.  We can only hope...  UPDATE:  The  urlLink new displays  are here.  The 20, 23 and 30 in!!!! And yes you can connect two 30" displays together for a grand total of 8 million pixcels!!  Also many new and cool features of  urlLink Tiger  were shown in the  urlLink keynote .  +MacMan
Check out the new links I added on the right.  If you have a link that you think I should add leave a comment.  More links to follow.  +MacMan  UPDATE:    For everyone who is still interested in a Gmail account check out the Gmail Machine link on the right.  The Gmail machine is like a Gmail lottery.  The machine randomly generates a number every time you click the refresh button.  The object is to "hit" the number 1337.  If you are lucky enough to do this you will recieve a brand new never been used Gmail invite.  Props to Scott and Kevin for the great idea.  -MacMan

Apple recently released a new product to its line of wireless accessories.   urlLink AirPort Express  is a great looking product.  It allows you to stream your entire iTunes collection to your stereo system.  Also you can use it to expand your already existing wireless network or use it as a wireless bridge.  The coolest feature of the AirPort Express is its ability to connect a printer to your network via USB.  Now thats cool!  Hopefully i can get my hands on one to test soon.    -MacMan
