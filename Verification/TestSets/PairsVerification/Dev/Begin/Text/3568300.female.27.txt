Set up The Booksmith blog. It was easy. And so here goes - the first entry!  Tomorrow evening (March 5, 2003), The Booksmith hosts San Francisco author  urlLink Cory Doctorow . Cory's first book,  Essential Blogging , came out late last year. This blog is a nod to you.  At tomorrow night's event, Cory will be reading from his new novel,  Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom . Reportedly, more than 75,000 copies of the book have been downloaded from his website. A few customers have come into the store and mentioned that they have already read the book on their computer or PDA. Yikes! All those downloads will certainly impact sales. If we can sell one tenth of one percent of 75,000 . . . .  By the way, Cory has a nifty blog to which he contributes. Its called  urlLink boingboing , and makes for pretty interesting reading.

urlLink David Sedaris  stopped by today to sign his latest incarnation,   urlLink Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim  ...  Much laughter rolled out of the back room, where he signed his new book. When we see him, it's hard for us not to crack a smile -- even if he's just standing by us, hinting at nothing.   I wonder what it's like for David Sedaris to be surrounded by people who can't stop smiling & chuckling away the afternoon and night...well, he has a pretty good gig.
Happy Bloomsday!
urlLink M. John Harrison's  latest work,   urlLink Light  , now tops my favorite sci-fi list.  This has got to be one of the best sci-fi books in nearly fifteen years. (One of my  urlLink coworkers  aptly describes M. John Harrison as a "writer's writer;"  urlLink China Mieville  is influenced by his writings/Harrison himself.) It's due in U.S. bookstores by August 2004.  Absolutely brilliant!  Not only will this book be life-changing, but...  I predict that  Light  will nearly single-handedly change the very nature of  urlLink modern physics .
As we wrap up the month of Bloom's Day, I would like to steer your attentions to another astounding Irish work:  At Swim-Two-Birds  by Flan O'Brien. I'd not hesitate to put this one right up there with  Master and Margerita  and  Confederacy of Dunces  as being one of the funniest, literate and clever novels I've had the good pleasure read. It's a meta-novel, a novel about a fellow writing a novel about a fellow writing a novel in which the characters rebel against their author and start writing a novel of their own. It also features a fine array of absurd side-players including an Irish demon known as the Pooka, an invisible Good Fairy, the hero Finn MacCool and some gunslinging cowpokes along with some of the finest examples of the English language ever put to paper. A hilarious and melodious read through and through, but sure to puzzle not a few. Give it a shot if you dare, by Gorra.
Sad news: Poet and longtime Booksmith customer  urlLink Carl Rakosi  has died. He was 100 years old, and had last visited the store a
