At the ripe ole’ age of 23 I am falling apart.&nbsp; I haven’t come to this conclusion lightly mind you; there are many things I can back my statement up with.         1. At the age of 15 I tore my ACL in half playing tennis.&nbsp; I proceeded to play 3 more years of tennis and a year of cheering in college on my knee before deciding to finally have surgery.&nbsp; After the surgery for the next two years my knee hurt worse then it did before I had the surgery.&nbsp; I do have to say that my knee doesn’t give me problems that much anymore, but that is still a very young age to tear your ACL.   2. In the past year I have been to the doctor for my back 3 times.&nbsp; The first time I went I found out that I had a Sciatica nerve problem.&nbsp; I had to go to the doctor several time and take lots of medication then one day it just decided to go away.  3.Back pain doctor visit number two.&nbsp; In June I woke up with the worst pain in my back I have ever felt.&nbsp; I would say I have a pretty decent pain tolerance from all the knee stuff.&nbsp; I can normally tolerate things pretty well, but this pain was so bad it had me in tears.&nbsp; I almost called my mother at 3AM to come and get and take me to the emergency room.&nbsp; I put some ice on it and went back to bed.&nbsp; After work the next day went to the doctor’s office and was given muscle relaxers, anti inflammatory and pain killers.&nbsp; After about a week the pain went away and I forgot all about it.   4.This week on Monday I went to the eye doctor because my eyes have been blood shot all the time and my right eye decided to go blurry on me Sunday.&nbsp; After that nice visit I was told I have an eye infection and am on some sort of eye drops to clear that up and am not allowed to wear my contacts.   5.On to back problem number 3.&nbsp; On Tuesday night I woke up with the same pain in my back again.&nbsp; I went to work and couldn’t make it, so I went to the doctor who told me the same thing he had told me a month and a half ago.&nbsp; At this point I’m feeling like it is kind of weird that a 23 year old is having all these back problems but I went home and lay on the couch waiting for the pain to stop.&nbsp; At 9PM the pain still hadn’t stop.&nbsp; You would think when you are 4 prescriptions that it should have eased up a little.&nbsp; My mom and dad came and got my around 9:30 and I spent about 2 hours in the emergency room.&nbsp; After some test and about 5 x-rays the conclusion was reached that I had thoracic back strain.&nbsp; Sounds like a pretty fancy ailment.&nbsp; I was giving another pain k
