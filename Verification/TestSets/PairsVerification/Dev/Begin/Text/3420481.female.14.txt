Wow... ok today was interesting. Watched "Dickie Roberts" this morning when I woke up. I memorized this...  brick wall, waterfall dickie thinks he's got it all but he don't  and i do so boom with that attitude peace punch captain crunch i got something you can't touch bang bang choo choo train wind me up, i do my thin no reeses pieces. 7 up you mess with me, i'll mess you up  Then I had to do my homework and Mitchel's friends came over. Who would have thought that 5th graders could be so annoying? Kristine called then and wanted me to go see Troy with her but we couldn't get in because it was rated R. Stupid ratings! We went and got ice cream from Rufes and walked home. The ice cream was so good. When we got back here I went to Kristine's and then we went to go get a ladder from some guy out in the country. On the way there I got to meet Kristine's dog Bob which, by the way, is a girl. Then we went to get the ladder from the dude and he had a dog so we played with that. Guess what else he had. HORSES! We got to go in the pen and pet them. We almost got to ride them but the lady wasn't there so we didn't. Then we got to go back to Kristine's. We had to get a bird nest out of this vent up high on the house. Next thing you know Kristine's dad is THROWING the birds from the height. They can't fly. We were so mad. I almost started crying and Kristine did. I ran away. Then we went to see how many survived. Three of five survived. We buried the other two. Right next to each other. I was so sad. The three that survived we made a home of a cardboard box, paper towel, and grass. We went to Abe and dug up some worms for the birds. We then mashed them up so we could give them to them. Breakfast... I hope they don't die over night. I would cry so hard. Then I had to come home to eat and watch T.V. with the family. Extreme Makeover: Home Edition. I love the show. It's very very good and fun. I wish we could have a home makeover.
