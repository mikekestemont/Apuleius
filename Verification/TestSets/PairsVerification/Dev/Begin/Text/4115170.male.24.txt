At the request of my passionate sister, I am setting up this blog to present a second side of our adventure and where it takes us. The sister site is  urlLink http://sibs-ontheroad.blogspot.com . So, I'm not full of literal history and significance. What I see is what you get, take it for what it's worth and develop your own opinion.  Never before have I spent as much time with Joy-Marie as I soon will. This will definitely be an experience to remember. The general idea is to travel cross-country with a loaded pickup from New York City to San Francisco while stopping in Colorado. Everything else is a possibility, an unknown idea, an adventure. I'm mostly excited about the stops at the national forests and state parks we may make. Joy is kind of the director and I'm the actor along for the ride. She says we fight a lot. I prefer to think of our confrontations as passionate disagreements.  I leave tomorrow from Colorado Springs, CO to meet Joy in NYC. I'm hoping for an uneventful journey that has me arriving in New York by Friday. Once I get there the adventure begins.
First, let's note that the Latin etymology of   sib  , a version of sibling, is   suus   - "one's own," which Merriam Webster links to the word   suicide  . To be fair, M-W also notes it with the Latin   sodalis   - "comrade."  So, will Brandon be a comrade who drives me to suicide? Or will I drive him to suicide? Mom has already warned me that he won't let me drive.  In 1950 anthropologist Meyer Fortes observed "Next to the bond between mother and child none is so strong as that between siblings by the same mother, " ( Systems of Kinship ) . In 1974 Jennie Melville wrote in her novel  Nun's Castle  "Siblings and kinsfolk did not have to be friends."  In few days, Brandon leaves Black Forest, Colorado to pick me up in New York City. I've been a graduate student here for the last 2 years. We'll pack my books in his green pick-up truck with camping gear and a cooler, and we'll take to the two-lane highways back to my home-base in San Francisco. The plan is to take it slow and enjoy the journey.  I've set up this blog, a travel-log, for our family and friends and whomever else is interested in the cross-country travels of a brother and sister. We're not the White Stripes, nor the Carpenters, nor the Osmonds, nor the Gyllenhaals. We're neither hip, rich, famous, or thin -- but we fight a lot. It should be fun.
