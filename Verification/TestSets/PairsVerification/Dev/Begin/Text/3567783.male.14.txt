I'm currently obsessed with paranormal stuffs. Found the Atheist board at GameFAQs, and they made a pretty great debate there whether God exists or not. I'm an Atheist myself, but I always believed that anything may or may not be possible in this world.  However, I read one of the posts about if you do no believe in God, you will go to hell. I mean, that is seriously ****ed up. Does that mean a person who is good in moral terms will burn in hell if he didn't believe in God and a criminal who believes in God will go to heaven?  Still trying to figure out what is the Seven Gates of Hell. I heard there are 6 Gates at the US and a Gate at the UK.  Heavy rain in the early morning. It's been years since I smelt this kind of rain... The smell of the sea.
Nothing much to write, except that my new e-mail is jinz_yami@hotmail.com. For those who are pissed off with me, you are allowed to throw acid on my face the next time I did that.

Did she even have the right to do that? Pn. Cheng = second ***** after Habibah.  I'm currently obssesed with Kadaj (no, not that way, you dirty minded people >_  Nothing really interesting happens in my life during the school days >_  Ja ne~

The word "international schools" made me think about Dinghy and Iona, who both graduated from the same school, aged 14 and 15 respectively. Dinghy's 18 now (I forgot to ask him what he's studying at the moment) while Iona (17) is taking medicine. Impressive, really impressive. /no1 to you two.  I forgot my dreams while I'm in a half-asleep mode, whenever my parents woke me up. I mean, it was like the dream was one second ago, then I woke up, and forgot about it. Weird...  And uh, to the readers, please post some comment about my blog, so I know that someone is reading this other than rhodry (Shaun) :P
Sometimes, imagination is a wonderful thing. You imagined yourself being with your Mr/Miss Perfect, enjoying your lovely moments together, or getting everything that you wanted in the world, living in a luxurious house in a beautiful scenery, with the wind blowing softly on your face, and the birds chirping, and your house overlooking the sea.  Well, let's imagine the other version of the above description. You're living in hell, blood drips on your walls, there are rusty chains and weird, s
