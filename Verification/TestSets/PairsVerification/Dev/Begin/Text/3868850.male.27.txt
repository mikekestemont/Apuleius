Last night Marion dominated in the long jump by a foot, and then broke down during her post-win interview.&nbsp; I can't imagine the pressure she was under.&nbsp; And yesterday we found out that Torri Edwards had tested positive for a stimulant back in April, I believe.&nbsp; Of course, she blamed it on some glucose supplement she was taking.&nbsp; I'm so sick and tired of athletes blaming supplements for their positive tests.&nbsp; What these athletes need to start doing is acting like professionals.&nbsp; If you don't know what your ingesting into your system, then don't ingest it.&nbsp; Seriously, are these people idiots?&nbsp; You're going to get tested so know what your taking.&nbsp; I have no sympathy or patience anymore. &nbsp; As long as I'm talking about drugs, what was up with LeMond?&nbsp; If has proof of Armstrong and drugs, then show it.&nbsp; If he doesn't, then he needs to shut up.&nbsp; I lost all respect for him.&nbsp; I'm just going to keep believing that Lance is legal.&nbsp; He hasn't failed a test, and nobody has credible proof as to his guilt.&nbsp; Maybe Le Mond has some that he's hiding from all the rest of us, and when Lance crosses the line in Paris he's going to show us everything.&nbsp; What an idiot!&nbsp; It's certainly interesting to note the comments about the French press not wanting to see an American with six Tour wins.&nbsp; Le Mond.&nbsp; If I had never heard of him before, he would sound like a French reporter. &nbsp; It's too bad Groose didn't make it in the 1500m.&nbsp; The quarterfinals were last night, and I believe he could have advanced through to the semifinals.&nbsp; He missed the Trials by .6 seconds.&nbsp; That has to be tough.&nbsp; Woodworth flew in last night, and she'll run tonight.&nbsp; Good luck, Liz! &nbsp; The men's steeple final was great.&nbsp; No screwing around.&nbsp; They went after it.&nbsp; The top five hit the Olympic A standard.&nbsp; They were through the fourth lap at 4:22.&nbsp; Yowser!&nbsp; Lincoln's kick was spectacular.&nbsp; Fam was pumped after his race--the only one that did a post race lap.&nbsp; And Gary, at 31, looked great too.&nbsp; He's staying at our Extended Stay.&nbsp; Now I just need to print off a picture I have of him so he can sign it. &nbsp; Festa ran well.&nbsp; He missed third by about a second.&nbsp; Cordes, I can only imagine, didn't have the race he wanted.&nbsp; It was till cool to see the two Wisconsin Runner team members in the final.&nbsp; Sandu Rebenciuc, the former DIII runner at Augustana, DNFed.&nbsp; I never saw what happened, and I never saw him leave the track. &nbsp; Another DIII guy, Andrew Rock, had a rough final.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong, he ran fast.&nbsp; Really fast.&nbsp; 44.96 fast.&nbsp; U
