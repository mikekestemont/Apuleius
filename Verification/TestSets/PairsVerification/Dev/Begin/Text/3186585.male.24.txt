The inaugral journey of 'Snowboard Central' begins. I hope this Blog, committed to providing useful information about local and global boarding destinations proves not be a frivilous exercise for all who grace this page!
Check out some of the ripping-it-up moves evident throughout the 2003 Australian Winter 'X' Games. These guys represent the cream of Aussie Snowboarding!! They'll be on display again this year for all to view at Perisher Valley. It's an awesome weekend that pulls thousands of spectators. Last year I went with 3 mates and entered ourselves in the 'tube race' and 'leap for cash'.  We didn't win either of the events, but it's the most fun I'd had in a long time.
Anyone who has travelled will say it was one of the best experiences of their life. The friends you make, places you visit, and cultures you embrace are unforgettable. While I can't give away a free trip or make these memories happen for you, what I can do is provide the information any boarder needs to get connected with the wider Snowoarding community and perhaps tee up the possibility of making some new friends. Who knows where it can go from there....you may be able to organise some cheap (or even free) accommodation with a new buddy, find the best snow locations this time of year, maybe even spark up a romance on-line.   It's all possible when you log-on and become a member of  urlLink  Snowboard.com . I became a member the other day and it's without a doubt the best site I've seen dedicated to Snowboarding. Best of all it's free!! I set up a user profile, posted a mugshot and gave some of my background history.  Within an hour of setting up my membership I was getting messages and chatting with other boarders across the world online. It was excellent. Not only can you chat, but there are forums for tricks, photos, jobs, accommodation, study and heaps more.  I definately recommend this bad boy to anyone wanting to get out there and communicate with the global boarding fraternity. Catch ya!
With the count down to the Aussie snow season well and truly in motion, I've taken it upon myself to cruise various travel web-sites in search of the cheapest ski and accommodation packages out there. Let me just say now, booking via the web is far and away the smartest move you can make. The savings are at worst, substantial. Check out some of the excellent deals on offer in the  urlLink STA  web-site for students and those of us on a tight budget.    Not surprisingly the competition between NSW and Victorian snow resorts this season is going to be fierce! It seems like the media marketing blitz has already begun and that it gets bigger every year. I've already seen and heard heaps of commercials on TV, radio, the web, and in the papers. It's definately gonna be an interesting inter-state race to see who captures the market in 2004. In NSW  urlLink Thredbo  and  urlLink  Perisher  have some of their usual alpine deals f
