okee...figured use the classic starting point: interstellar cold war. not yet risen to the battlefield yet (but you know it won't be long). The sides are basically staring at each other while amassing their forces. Side one- well humans gotta appear somewhere or it gets just a li'l too alien. They accidentally sparked this situation during their early explorations. though that was going on two hundred years ago, their enemies aren't quite so short lived as them, and not known for forgiving natures. They're quite the large government as well- humans have only recently (in comparison to the other races present in space) begun to explore. they have a mere two, three hundred planets to their domain with roughly 25% not actually habital, just being used as refineries. they don't count worlds they can't populate OR use in any way (gaseous giants and the like- blue star systems especially. that's begging for a radiation bath). on the other hand- you have the people who's toes they stepped on early by having settled a mining colony in an area that was under dispute. The humans naturally didn't know that the area was already claimed-but by their logic, as it was closer to any of their systems than it was any of the others' systems and they settled it first- it's their's.   the political situation is thus: We have two powerful governments long established in space who didn't realize a race new to space was coming in from an area previously ignored by them (simply cuz it was too remote to be worth the pursual when there were richer planets and systems within easy reach). One is a 'democracy' style, the other is totalitarian.  they had been at sort of a truce/peace agreement stage when humans blundered into things and dropped a match on the powder keg.  On one hand- the humans will have to eventually pick a side if theywant to survive...that's the thinking of both governments. Which is great to them..cuz it means that they can likely annex the systems the humans have already developed into their own governmental reach and thus gain a major territory leap with minimal effort. -naturally neither government wants the other one to gain that advantage.  On the other hand....you know how contrary human nature can be. we might know what we SHOULD do...but that and what we /do/ decide to do tend to be two very different things. They're well aware that if they side with /either/ government- they're losing their independance. they'll be completely swallowed up by such massive groups (a fate that's already befell a few races who've been drawn entirely into either government).  that's as far as I've gotten with it.  (amendment past this point) The 'democratic' government is more of a communistic/socialistic one now. to play on differences between the various species.  Also we have determined that the human government is working on its defenses in hopes of keeping both governments at bay if it can just entrench itself well enough. To keep the other two governments at bay, they've s
