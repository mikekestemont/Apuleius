Dreams really don't come true... Last time I would hope to dream of "him" as that is the only way to feel him. But when I really dreamt of him, I would realise the outcome would be opposite. Why liking someone is so painful and difficult?? Am I wrong to love him and hold onto him?  Why my friends begged me to forget him and let go? For 1 year, I always think of him, thinking of all the possibilities that caused him to change. How would someone change drastically overnight?! It's impossible... I am unable to accept it... What had I done wrong that caused him to leave me without explanation?!  Why are you so heartless to me.... Why are you treating me this way... Why.... Why forgetting you is so difficult?! WHY!! IF ONLY I never liked you, I would be much happier now! Why do I still care so much for you know.. Why do I have to like you, when you don't even care... Why am I doing all these for you when I know you would never be back to me again????
&nbsp; I have lose almost everything I once had... I no longer have the confidence I once carried for myself... I am losing control of myself and is no longer at the right "side" of my mind. Sometimes I would just cry on my bed, thinking of what I had gone through... I am really very tired... Why do I have to go through so many obstacles and in the end, I still lose them?? &nbsp; Why do I have to face all these alone?? For 2 years, my life was never going any better. 2 years back, it was my ex boyfriend who made my life miserable and upside down. Just when I thought everything would be better after we break, things became even worst than I expected. 1 year back, the guy I love a lot left me. I left my ex boyfriend 2 years ago was because of this particular guy whom I thought I love, and yet this guy leeft me 1 year ago. Perhaps this is retribution...  &nbsp; Why did I love someone who never love me? Why did I choose to hold onto him and never wanted to give up? Why was I so foolish and silly? I loved him a lot... I knew I couldn't do without him... When he left me, I was very scared he would forget me. I used to hate him for being heartless and cruel, but I never did hate him. The fact is I no longer blame him for anything now, because my feeling is already numb.
Today I bought 3 sets of uniform for my attachment in hospital. It is a simple white dress and looks plain. However, I like it a lot, perhaps is something "new" to me?    Today is my 2nd week in poly and well, so far so good. Nothing much to comment and felt numb in many ways.    Towards relationship, I have nothing much to comment. My h
