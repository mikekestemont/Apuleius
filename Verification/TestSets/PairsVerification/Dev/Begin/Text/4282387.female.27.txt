Well today was a pretty normal day...worked...well I was at work all day, but I wasn't very productive! I emailed a lot and surfed the web a little....*sigh* I need a new job!   After work, picked up my baby and we went to the mall...he has a b-day party to go to tm'w, and so we bought a present for that, as well as some new clothes for both of us...and I bought Norah Jones, Van Morrison, and Barry Manilow cd's.....yes, I love Barry Manilow! I'm not ashamed, he's a great singer & his songs are sweet &amp; catchy.  Anyway...(I'm listening to Norah right now, the song 'What am I to You"...it's on repeat, I want to know it well enough to sing along, all the words!!

I had my son when I was 19 (I know a lot of people think I'm crazy for that) plus I was single (people think I'm even crazier for that!). The truth is, I wasn't ready for a child (I was just getting ready to go into my second year of college), and I actually made an appointment to have the pregnancy terminated...but I couldn't bring myself to go. I just couldn't. Also, the thought occured to me: what if this is my only chance to have a baby? ....and those two things together pretty much made the decision for me.  I have no idea if ANYONE will ever read this, but if anyone does, do you know what synchronicity is? It's when something happens that's like a coincidence, but has a lot more meaning and is just too big to be simple coincidence....like a simple example, is a woman being set up with the same man, several years apart, once on the west coast and once on the east coast! I read that one in a book about synchronicity. Here's another though, and this happened to a friend of mine. We'll call her Lisa. She was engaged, and she and her fiance were planning on getting married in Las Vegas. She ended up breaking off the engagement, but still went to Vegas...on the day she was supposed to get married, she m
