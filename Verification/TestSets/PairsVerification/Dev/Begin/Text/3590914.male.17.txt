Music:  ambient trance  Mood:   active   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note to self: get cool emoticons from   to use for my mood [ urlLink Emoticon Page ].  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a big fan of dA, i spend quite some time there actually. if you look at my dA page I have all sorts of favorites....I just keep adding to them. One of these days maybe i'll do something artsy and post something cool....maybe...someday.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Gentoo linux install is almost done on the P3, i'll be ready to start it on my Athlon-XP...or maybe I should install it on my sister's old 400 MHz celeron....yeah, maybe. If i can get her to not use it for a day or so...maybe longer depending on how long it takes even with distcc. I'd use a stage 3 install for hers as well as the P3, just so i can get it up and have a replacement desktop to use for a few days. I'll use them both to speed up the compile time of my stage 1 gentoo build for my AthlonXP. then i'll set up grid computing or something to that effect and harness the power of all 3 (perhaps a 4th soon) computers!! why I need all that power is beyond me, but why not use it if you can?  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had my first ride on a motorcycle today where i wasn't in a sidecar. I was an old all original '57 harley. Ted was in front and I sat behind him. beautiful day for a ride....  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to go to the local library tomorrow to do research on some colleges. I'll post my list of colleges that I plan on visiting tomorrow and then after a few visits i'll pick 6 or less to apply to. I got my final grades and they aren't TOO bad (if you weight them the score goes up).  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P.E.: 96 - weighted: 101? (how do you weight gym?) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;APUSH: 73 - weighted: 84 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AP Chem: 85 - weighted: 98 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;English 3 H: 81 - weighted: 89 - might be AP wieght: 93 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Engineering: 90 - weighted: 95 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advanced Math H: 91 - weighted: 100 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spanish 4 H: 92 - weighted: 101  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Average: 87 - weighted: 95 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calculated GPA: 94.9 (i think) - old GPA was 102.94...i went down. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Average GPA: 100.26 ( i assume)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so good news all around. I didn't do as bad as I initially thought that I would. hurray!!
Music:   216.156.1.38:8200/ (shoutcast stream)  Mood:   hacker mood   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no blogs, lots of blogs, no blogs, lots of blogs...so maybe it was my fear of talking about what I had to talk about. now that thats over i feel the need to share again, although so much is horribly wasted because I can never remember what i wanted to write about. its never organised and cohesive. ideas come and go. its a mess.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to read this guy scott's blog [ urlLink www.scottishot.com ] and it was really cool for a while. then he stopped being an online nerd a
