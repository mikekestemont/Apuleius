The concept of a "new economy" in the 21st Century stems from new wealth, once drawn predominantly from natural resources and tangible commodities, achieved through innovative ideas mediated by new mind tools, viz., technology.  The tools, of course, innovative to start -- having seduced a multitude of speculators to invest in what can only be described as abstract spaces  -- now form the basis of innovations that could not have been realized without sophisticated technologies.  Since the start of micro computing, investors have gambled on the emergent new tools, most making monumental profits.  Today, large organizations such as governments, academic institutions, and corporations are determined to uncover with certitude the key to nurture intellectual property.  If the new economy is rooted in ideas, viz., arts and sciences, those with greatest interest in capital gain seek to enrich the individual and society on the basis of harnessing creative capital.     Clearly it is a peculiar condition we live in, where the brightest minds are sought after as the new natural resource. In deference to artists and scientists alike who have not profited from creative capital in the same manner as producers and distributors, we salute you. Speculators beware -- there is no more certainty in the value of goods and services arising from hard commodities than arising from the creative mind.   Just as the Dutch in the 17th century could not have foreseen the demise of their precious tulip by a fickle public, neither can we be certain of the knowledge market.  Those who seek the best minds from which to profit will also find that, like all economic venture, minds are as unpredictable as the marketplace itself.
When we   read, write, listen, speak , we engage the most important tools for shaping the mind.  Newer  mind tools   (i.e., new media) have been developed over the past twenty years, drawing us into the New Economy where creative capital is edging out traditional economies.

Brilliant! I love the comments that are beginning to surface...if you haven't read everything on the blog yet, go ahead and surf...be sure to read the comments under each post...  I just had an "aha" moment! Deductive logic (“It’s elementary my dear Watson”) brings fruitful ends! Science as a “way of knowing and doing” is a powerful method for discovery.  Whenever one is puzzled by a phenomenon, careful observation will often reveal a pattern, which then leads one to further investigate.  The result may yield uncompromising truths!  There is a reason for the "time delay" between the second you hit "publish post" and the time it is published!     It turns out that Blogger offers a special feature for the administrator.  Comments that are published are first sent to me to review via email.  Once I have downloaded your comment from the server, which I may want to delete if it is “inappropriate,” Blogger then publishes the posting.  That feature is an excellent one for teachers using Blogs with their class, as they m
