Im Sitting here in an Enriching town called Richmond. Everything Is Perfect. Everyone is calm and no one is in a hurry The lights are dimly lit out on the street, revealing the path for strangers The slightest roar of engines are moving out in the distance how serene the sky looks , so beautiful in every way The mysterious Stars shine through like tiny passageways into the deep unknown Everywhere you look, it all has so much to say The Buildings are old and proud with many stories to tell A Slight clamoring of excited footsteps go up and down the elder stairs ...It was a person, an intricatly designed captivating human being such as ourselves I hear the silent humming of fans off in the distance ...helping people to keep cool and help the chill in their spine arise the deep tone is massaging my soul... Every face I see in this lovely town is more beautiful than the last I open my soul for all of them and strech but a smile to help them on their way Some people say there is too much trash in Richmond, but really, if you just look a little closer, youll see that its all there to teach you something... Everything is perfect and so will it be for yet another day...
