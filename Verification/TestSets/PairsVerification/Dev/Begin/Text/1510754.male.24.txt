Howdy Gents and sick women. Welcome to the nightmare that is    Beer 'N' Porn .  I make no apologies for what you may find here. Suffice it to say, this will be evidence of what happens when a group of your average no-nonsense type guys get together in the name of booze, cheap thrills, and intellectual conversation. This is our take on the world around us. Visit often and stay as long as you like.   Since I started this damn thing, I guess I'll go first. Hang on tight....     I remember being young (younger - 6 or so) and imagining what it’d be like to be 20-something. At that point, I considered 20-something to be fairly old. By then I’d be able to drive, vote, drink, smoke “ I’d have my own home and I’d probably be getting married soon to some beautiful and intelligent woman who loved me right back. I’d be bigger and stronger. I would be a grown up. I thought about it frequently and it made me impatient. I wanted to be old enough to have responsibility but no more “ I didn’t want to be old. Although old age isn’t exactly bearing down on me any time in the near future, it again has become the subject of my daily thoughts. Not in the same way as when I was six years old, however.

Oh sure some are similar in nature and concept. But somewhere along the line, personal opinion “ the real and deep impressions they make on us and we make on ourselves daily”questions, answers, analysis of what and why”our genuine sentiment”true thought uninterrupted by pressure “ gets added to the mix. From that, a few definitions of gay get splintered into innumerable sub-opinions, sub-sub-opinions and offshoots of sub-opinions and so on and so on. In the end, everyone has there own personal definition and opinion of what gay is. I’d assume it’s like that for just about every topic of thought. But my problem comes from my definition so it’s important that I put it out on the table. Try and bear with me.   What other people think of me being gay:   I’m not a true man. I’m not a complete and masculine man. I am more woman than a straight man. I’m weak and girlish and like girlish things which makes me less of a man.   This hurts. It hurt to constantly battle with all of these (and many other) thoughts o
