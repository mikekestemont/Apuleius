Hellooo! I'm at the Sarit Center Internet cafe. It’s the first time I’ve been here since I got back: nothing ever changes.  Today, officially marks the last ever-day of summer. Pour moi. Technically it is a weekend, so I'd have in off anyway, in which case it's not a holiday-day, but whatever- the point is, I start school tomorrow. High school. I'm depressed and wish to stay in denial about all of it as long as possible, because otherwise, I'll get depressed, and moody, and I'll think too much about the school year which will lead to stress and result in me having a panic attack. As it is I won't be able to sleep tonight.  Anyway, I saw Mean Girls at Village yesterday. Liked it. A little weird. And not a very comforting "back-to-school" flick, but it was funny. I think my mom was a little horrified and felt no pity for any of the characters. Going to the Village Market on the weekend before ISK opens for the new year is insane, and especially for someone as anti-social as me. You run into a million people. It's a complete guarantee that you will run into at least 15 people that you know. It is also a guarantee that you will run into someone who you don't want to see. Those are not pretty odds. Every path that you take is a hazard, and timing is everything. Thankfully, I ran into a bunch of people who I did want to see, and ended up sitting next to Tessa and Pernille in the cinema, which was lots of fun.  So, um... nothing else up really with me... last night I watched two Sex and the City episodes with my family. (As it is a good, wholesome, family show that we can all enjoy together- NOT. Actually I only survive through watching it with my family by putting a big pillow in front of my face.) Once everyone had gone upstairs or to work, I watched Ordinary People, and had myself a good, nice, long cry.  Anyone been watching the Olympics? I'm hoping to get hooked.  I am already trying to start planning next summer, or at least my next long vacation, which is far too long ahead, but I find that I always need something to look forward to.  More Later... Kat  Tash- hope you're having a rly fun time in Thailand, I just checked out your blog and left you a message. Talk to you soon hopefully?!
Heey. I think that I managed to fix the comments thing so that it is possible for anyone, even "non-bloggers", to post stuff.  "Mean Girls" is coming out today in Kenya!
Hey. Apparently ppl are having trouble posting comments 'cause no "anonymous bloggers" (never thought I'd say that) are allowed. I will try and change that... somehow...  I swear that Harvey is going through a serious off phase. It's like the Great Depression. He just... sits there, in his stupid little corner. He hardly ever even wakes me up in the middle of the n
