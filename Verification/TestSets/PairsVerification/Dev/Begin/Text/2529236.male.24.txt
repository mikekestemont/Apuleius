I posted a link to this on my old blog, but I want to post again.  These are the funniest freaking things I've seen online in a long time.    Once again, I give you the freaky-stoner-bizarro  urlLink GI JOE Public Service Announcements !
Rawk and Roll Hoochie Coo.  I'm back!  You know it!
Welcome to BlaggBlogg 2.  I'm currently in the testing phase for this new blog, so bear with me...
Unbelievably--the media has all but completely ignored this story.  For those of you that don't already know -- George W. Bush went AWOL during his "service" in the Texas Air National Guard.  At least, that's what the records say...  For FACTS about these allegations, read  urlLink this .
If you're still pro-war, you're obviously completely out of touch with reality.    I CHALLENGE you to watch  urlLink this  and see if your concience remains unmoved...
I'm sure many of you have wondered just whatever happened to Johnny Lawrence.  I've often pondered the eventual outcome of this aryan god we all remember so fondly from his career-defining turn in The Karate Kid.
