If you don't kow what Family Guy is, then you are crazy.  It is the best show ever created, al least, it was.  Foxcanceled the maing of FG after 50 episodes, and it hasnt appeared sence.  Re-runs show on Cartoon Network at 11:30pm, but those are no fun.  Due to the millons of FG DVD's sold, production is beginning again and (i think) 30 new eppisodes will be ready by January 2005, (or so i hear).  For the latest FG comeback news, or for the good old trivia, wallpapers, news, sales, games, features, and entertainment relating to FG, here are some links to my favorite FG sites! (links listed in order of favorite, to not the best, but still pretty damn  good) http://quahog5news.com/ http://www.familyguyfiles.com/main.php http://www.planet-familyguy.com/main.php http://evilmonkey.tv http://quagscorner.com
Im really excited about having my own blog.  I'm not exactly sure what im going to post her yet, but it will probably end up being about my interests and random topics.  For example, cool music, (the return of) Family Guy, my Tech Camp, stuff about WJ, and loads of other stuff.  Remember to check often to see if i have posted anything that meets your interests as i will post things quite regularly, (bcuz i have nothing else to do).  Okay, until my next post, peace out!
I woke up to the sound of the doorbell today and to my suprise, there was Heather from 6th grade and her brother Anderew, acompanied be Peter and Ross. I had just thrown on some clothes and the basement was a MESS! It was really cool to see her again bacause she has changed so much. We hung out in the basement for a while, then went down to the rope swing in Rock Creek and hung out there for a while. If you havnt already heard the miserable story of what happened last summer, in a nutshell, she owes me and Peter a big favor. She didnt get to stay long today, so me and Pete didn't get our rewards. Heres the thing, since she couldnt stay for more than 2 hours, she'll be back tomarrow! Cant wait. Oh, and in case u havnt seen her in a long time, heres a pic from today. Peace!!
Ok, today i went to see iRobot with Peter and Ross.  Despite what reviews may say, it is a kick ass movie.  Will Smith is great in it, and the plot is not bad.  It's kinda like a more realistic Matrix where the robots revolt and try and take over the world.  Pretty cool.  As we were leaving, they handed out drugs to everyone.  Is that legal?  Anyways, we decided to roam the mall for about an hour, then he hung around outside, talking mostly about diseases and chicks.  Then my dad came and picked us up, and now were all sitting here in my basement watching Monk and eating stale cake.  This is the good life.  Peace!!
I just got back from mowing this dude's lawn and i am so beat.&nbsp; I was in a real hurry to get it done s
