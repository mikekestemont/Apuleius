Highlights?  No highlights.  The show sucked.  Sorry, Jimmy.  However, Michael Jackson was awarded a birthday cake from one of the village people.  That was pretty cool.  Sorry if I'm a little crabby today.  I had a run in with our infamous receptionist today.  Grrr.  I thought that Christine had the all-time worst relationship with a door-hostess, but ours puts hers to shame.
Will someone please tell me about the highlights of the VMAs?  You're killing me here!  Sorry I can't make it to MN this weekend.  I need to help Billygoat move the rest of his stuff to Cleveland. But a trip is somewhere in the near future...I can see it now: Hal, Stoner, Bobo, and DJS enjoying a nice cold one at Lee's Liquor Lounge.  That sounds like my kind of dream weekend.  As long as 2 Tix plays something by Styx, of course.
Oh, one more thing: Panda, if you come to MN, then I can meet you!  I'm guessing that will push it right over the top!
I went to the State Fair last night.  Here's what I ate:  1/2 order of Australian fries (with ranch and cheese; served by folks who talk like Aussies), 1/2 order of cheese curds, one entire root beer float, a medium sprite at the food barn.  Can I gripe about a few things though?  The swine barn, cattle barn and sheep barn were all closed for cleaning to bring in new animals, so I did not get to see my favorite part:  the champion (pronounced champine) hog.  But the state fair people still made me pay my full eight dollars to get in!  How does that work?
Hey, Panda... yet another reason why you should consider a last-minute trip to MN - MTV will surely be re-running the big show all weekend long!
It's nights like tonight that I wish I had cable.  Will someone please fill me in on the details of the VMAs tomorrow?  Great. 'preciate it.
I heard that tonight “P. Diddy” is throwing “the greatest party of all time” after the MTV Video Awards.  Out of the 1500 people on the guest list, I wasn’t invited.  *sniff, sniff*…   urlLink
Last Christmas, Hal gave me a few calendars. One of them is a "Perpetual Postcard Calendar" from the Tate Gallery. I just thought I would share the description of one of the more unique postcards:  "Cold Dark Matter: An Exploded View"  Garden shed and contents, blown up for the artist by the British Army.  Of course, this picture isn't as interesting as "Misty and Jimmy Paulette, NYC" -- two drag queens in the back of a cab. "Zagi" is a painting of a naked lady stretching her calves against a wall, as if she is about to go out streaking. "Swingeing London 67 (f)" is my personal favorite though -- it's two guys on a bus, shielding themselves from the paparazzi.  And that's the story of my perpetual postcard calendar. Stay tuned for more exciting posts...it's a slow day, and I have plenty to say.
Don't even try to pretend you don't love it, DJS. I c
