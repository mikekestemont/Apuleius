A story from Olivia, almost verbatim: "Manera's sister and grandmother died in the Nazi war. But, the happy part is she found a new grandmother and sister. Gracie had a brother. Gracie didn't want to be the new sister, so her brother is going to be Manera's sister now. The grandmother's name is First William Born in Springtime. And, the funny part is she's not even dead yet. She's 88, but she's not dead."
Staying up late is screwing up everything. When I don't have enough sleep, I want to drink coffee, which I don't drink, and I want to eat chocolate, which I don't want to eat. At the very least I want to eat  something . I think I should go home and take a nap. But, I rode my bike today, and I the thought of riding home right now is pretty daunting. I can barely hold my head up!
Everytime I've written in my journal about being happy, or about loving something, or thinking someone is cool, I read it later, and am embarrassed at my past self's gullibility, my optimism, and my inability to grasp just how shitty things really are. For years, I've been reluctant to write when I'm happy, fearing the judgement of my future self.   My worst fear is that I won't be nice to myself? Don't I have  any  control over that?

I joined in September '03, 8 months ago. We do group recitations, much to my horror. We talk about God, much to my horror. We routinely divulge too much personal information, much to my horror. And, much to my horror, I love it all. Cynical me is buying in, and not just a little bit.  And I haven't had a drink in 8 months. And I have hope for the future. And I feel joy... somewhat to my horror.
Martha had an appointment this morning, so I stayed home with Olivia. How awful is it that I don't want to pretend that a new baby has been born and Olivia is the mother, and I'm the grandmother, and Olivia is leaving on a plane to pick up the baby, and when she returns the grandmother is going to cry for joy to see the new baby, and ask to hold her, and ask questions about the flight, about the birth family, and about the baby? How awful is it that I don't want to play this game over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over?
When I finalize the sale of my business at the closing, I will be getting a chunk of money. It's not a big chunk, but a chunk none-the-less. Also, I will become unemployed. So, the chunk of money won't be replinishing itself. I want to start another company, so I want to live on the c
