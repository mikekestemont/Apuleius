Here is the first posting of Al's Picks, a list of my top choices in a variety of subjects, ALong with related commentary:  �My favorite book is "Ender's Game" by Orson Scott Card. It follows a young boy with a brilliant strategic mind as he trains for war against an aggressive ALien species in a Battle School. I especially admire the theme of games throughout the book (the literary device is used wonderfully), the plot twists, and the story in generAL. I highly recommend it, as well as the rest of the series and other books by the author, including "The Worthing Saga." Hatrack.com.  �My favorite movie is "GoldenEye" of the James Bond series. Bond, a secret agent for British Intelligence, works to thwart a diabolicAL plot to destroy London. Amazing storytelling, acting, music, plot� just plain cool. You MUST see this movie. I feel guilty though, because when I exposed my friend Matt to it, he became obsessed with the series (that includes the old ones, which aren't that good for the most part), irrevocably changing the course of human history forever. Besides that, I would recommend the next two movies of the series, "Tomorrow Never Dies" and "The World Is Not Enough." I am also rapt with anticipation of the newest one, "Die Another Day." Jamesbond.com.     Furthermore, I enjoyed such films as "George Lucas in Love," a ten-minute parody of "Star Wars" and "Shakespeare in Love" which my cousin did the music for; "Princess Mononoke,"  a great anime epic; "Star Trek Six: The Undiscovered Country," which ALudes to some famous historicAL events, if you're well-read and quick enough to catch them; "The Mummy," the new version with some awesome action, speciAL effects, and comedy; "Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones" which was wonderful, but, like the last one, had its ups and downs; and "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" and "Austin Powers in Goldmember," a pair of hilarious James Bond spoofs. From this long entry, it's clear that I'm avid for films, having co-founded the Newton Film Society a.k.a. Springtime for Hitler, which has but three members.  �My favorite comic strip is FoxTrot. It is ordinarily extraordinarily funny, and its main character, Jason Fox, shares an unusuAL magnitude of traits with my friend Jonny.  �I am not sure what my favorite song is. Top contenders include, not in order of favoritism, "Rhapsody in Blue" by George Gershwin, "Eleanor Rigby" by the Beatles, "I Feel The Earth Move" by Carole King, "GoldenEye" by Tina Turner, "Pretty Fly For A Rabbi" by Weird Al Yankovich, "Star Wars Gangsta Rap" by Bentframe, and "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen.  �My favorite subject is social studies. History for some reason intrigues me, with tales of mighty empires of ages long past and the struggle to become the dominant nation on the planet. This may change, however, if my class and/or in the coming year turns out to be terribAL.  �My favorite modern country is Canada. Why, you ask? Canada never hurt anybody. Other contenders include Switzerland, AustrALia, and Japan, for n
