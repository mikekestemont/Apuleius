Me and my friend were thinking one day, how could there be like 5 or 6 Guys to come before Neo? in the span of 30-40 years there's the Matrix Mr. Anderson as a child and the Real World Neo. they must have been alive at the same time. BUT... How? Would that not indicate another Mr. Anderson on the rise? or was it he was killed to cause Neo to pick the other door, The door to Trinity. They are a great trilogy and I suggest that any sci-fi / fantasy lover watch them, if you have not already, which like half the population of the world&nbsp;has. So many puzzles maybe when i finally get to play MATRIX: ONLINE they will be answered. i'll go in search of this Mr. Anderson... If he indeed does exist. Many of ym thoughts may sound ludocrist to many but you are not in my mind so do not criticize me. and questions or comments email me b/c my posts are bein gay..........im me also. BUT...aww forget it...
Tell a limitless being to create a rock it cannot lift...........can it be done? if it is limitless how can it not pick it up?

They were all corralled in small cities, loaded onto space ships and launched into space to be sent to a little place called the sun. Some got free of being captured and made small rebel groups to try and retake the planet. Humans regretted the invention of A.I. they also lost all belief in any kind of deity because they weren’t answering their calls and so they all became a unified people against the machines (A.K.A the mechs).   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This section of the history of the humans starts with a small band of rebels that have utilized the special technology of converting the mind of a mech. This unique thing could be the answer to the rebellion. They hoped. M A R C H 1 5, 5 0 9 3 “God damnit close the doors!” came the screaming voice of the Captain. The loud screaming and screeching of joints and gears becoming louder and louder. “Sir, the doors are closing too slowly.” Said the voice on the radio. “I know we will need to do a manual override- NO TIME GET THE AUTO GUNS ONLINE NOW!!!” the three men just reaching the door went straight for the door controls. “No, t
