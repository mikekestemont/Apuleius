So, I just got back from work, which went by verrrry verrrrrrry slowly today. Like UBER slow. I really despise the word uber, by the way. But anyway, I got mean guy today. Mean guy is the old man who is soooo picky. I went to give him his blizzard and he said he wanted me to "level it" and put it in a bag with a spoon and one napkin. Ok leveling ice cream, sure.  ONE  napkin, sure. Then I count back his change to him and he takes it from me, counts it again and says "you're welcome" and left. It was MEAN. Then I got this other old man who smelled and had like a lion mane coming out of his chest, it actually curled over his shirt. But the day was pretty good overall.     I spent about fifteen minutes hoping Lance would come and visit me, then I realized...I'm sweaty, wearing a DQ visor and I'm covered in ice cream and toppings, no I can't say I wanted anyone I know to see me like that.

All I can think about is Lance, which is bad because I know that our plans rarely work out, which makes me sad, and I know I like him and maybe(hopefully), He likes me too, and maybe like can become something bigger and maybe I can stop day dreaming... Speaking of Dreaming I had the oddest dream last night. And I'm going to tell you all about it. This person, I don't know whether they were a girl or boy, but this person, came up to me and he was wearing a cape. And he was talking, but I couldn't hear him...but I still understood. So what he somehow communicated to me was that we had to fly somewhere. I didn't question the flying, I could just suddenly could do it, and in this dream flying was swimming, but in the sky. So we flew to this huge building. It looked like a Grecian inspired temple, but it was circular and there were gold guilded rungs on a few of the colums. So We both flew into this huge building and there were sparkly things all interconnected by a huge sparkling ruby red string hanging from the very top of the building, which was probably twenty o
