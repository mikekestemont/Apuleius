I have a couple different people in mind when the word annoying comes up.&nbsp; There is one person in particular, a girl who shall remain nameless.&nbsp; She is a genuinely good person and a good friend, but she also knows how to work every last nerve in a human body.&nbsp; Her idea of, &nbsp;"I'll call you later,"&nbsp;means that she will call you in a matter of twenty minutes.&nbsp; The funniest part is that she will call with her regular number, but if you don't answer, she'll call right back blocking her number from the caller id.&nbsp; I have made a joke about it a couple times, so she is aware of the fact that I know it's her.&nbsp; I've asked her not to do it, but she doesn't get it I suppose.&nbsp; She has a habit of calling at the wrong time as well.&nbsp; For instance, I tell her not to call me before 5 p.m., she calls at 4:45.&nbsp; As annoying as she can be though, she is still one of the best friends I have.&nbsp; I know that I can depend on her if I ever need help with anything.&nbsp; She is always there for me if I need a shoulder to cry on, and she can depend on me.&nbsp; We have been friends for a very long time, almost 10 years.&nbsp; Everyone has their annoying habits and if we don't learn to accept that, we will never really have any friends.
After five years of not being in school, most of the people I associate myself with question, why now?&nbsp; Well the answer is easy, I want to better myself.&nbsp; I've realized that nobody will help me to be successful except myself.&nbsp; I am at a point in my life right now where I need to focus on my career.&nbsp; I have many goals and things that I would like to accomplish, but everyday that goes by I realize that I am pushing myself further from this goal.&nbsp; I know that I am capable of being successful but I am my own worst enemy.&nbsp; I prevent myself from doing many things by not having my priorities straight.&nbsp; Not this time.&nbsp; This time I am prepared for the challenge, I'm going to embrace my future and allow myself to grow.&nbsp; There is a song with lyrics "time is on my side", but in reality, all time does is work against you.&nbsp; Each day that passes, life becomes harder, so now it is my opportunity to fight time and make my life easier.&nbsp; I am proud of myself for being back in school and I will be successful!&nbsp; So stay on my good side because one day you may need a job at my firm!
Sup people.....what's really good? &nbsp;
