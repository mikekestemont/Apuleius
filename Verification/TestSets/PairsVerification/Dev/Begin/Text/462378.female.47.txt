Yesterday Was a Generally Depressing, Weird Day  I was very saddened to hear about George Alec Effinger's death.  While I hadn't been in touch in a while, we'd hung out some at conventions over the years.  George had a hard life, was often ill, and I wasn't all that shocked to hear he'd died relatively young (at 55).  Still...you couldn't help but hope it was just one of those bizarre net-rumors, like the people who post, almost daily, that Reagan or Hope had died.  We also had very strange weather.  It was sunny, humid and in the '70s in the morning and early afternoon.  It turned very windy and we spent the afternoon having tornado watches.  Despite that, in our part of Pittsburgh, there was little lightning or rain, and the wind probably only gusted to about 50 mph.
We Spent an Enjoyable Three Days...  ...up in Boston and a cold, rainy day down in Newport.  Jim and I help to run science fiction conventions.  Last year, we managed the  urlLink Program  division  for the Millennium Philcon.  So now that we're starting to emerge from the burn-out from last year's Worldcon, we're starting to work on the 2004 Worldcon.  We really don't know what we'll be doing for the next Noreascon.  Jim has been somewhat more definite than I've been; I have some ideas of what I'd like to do, but I'm mostly trying to be very flexible and open-minded.  While we lived in Massachusetts from 1982-1993, we only spend about a week a year up there now as we're settled in Pittsburgh.  Boston is really bustling, despite the high tech bust.  I saw at least eight different limos in the Back Bay last Saturday night.  We visited friends and family and had some terrific meals.  We highly recommend Tapeo, a suburb Spanish Tapas restaurant about three blocks away from the Sheraton (home of next year's  urlLink Boskone  and  urlLink N4 in 2004 ).
April 15:   My First "Official" Weblog  I went to a political event tonight, "in honor" of tax day.  It was supposed to be something of an environmetalist's nightmere on how our taxes, especially our state taxes, are being spent.   That was fine, but some of the "entertainment" was on the clueless side.  One group decided that doing a three minute rant on Palestinians as victims was an appropriate way to educate us about environmental affairs.  At least two people walked out.  Instead of applauding or booing at the end, I said, "That was really poor judgement on your parts."  There's plenty of blame to go around in the Middle East.  I'm not a Sharon fan, and I think he and Isreal have behaved badly, particularly of late.  But to portray the Palestinians as the only victims means you can ignore the hundreds of people murdered in terrorist attacks recently.  Ironically, I heard a brief ray of hope for Isreali-Palestinian relations just this morning.  There's a hospital in Israel (in Jerusalem, I think - it may be called Hadassah) that treats all people injured by acts of terrorism or w
