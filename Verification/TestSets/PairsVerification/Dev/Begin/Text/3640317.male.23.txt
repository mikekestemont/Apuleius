We can get the message count of a message queue using MSMQ Local Admin API  MQMgmtGetInfo() . This API is fully supported by Microsoft on all versions of MSMQ. We can call this API from C#.NET directly as P/Invoke. Or we can write a C++ Managed wrapper over it and then call it from C#.NET. I preferred the second approch because it is much faster and there is no possibility of runtime data type mismatches as it is there in P/Invoke.  To call this API, we need two files; 1)  mq.h  and 2)  mqrt.lib . Both these files should be there in your system if you have VC++ 7.0 (i.e., VC++ of .NET 2003) installed on your system.  Now start a new VC++ Class Library project "MsmqApiLib" in your .NET IDE. Add mqrt.lib as an external dependency of that project. And then include the mq.h in your MsmqApiLib.cpp file.  And then embed the following code in your function body -  ========================================= // Machine -> Name of the remote machine //            or NULL for local machine. // eg, buddha // Queue   -> Formated name of the queue //            with " queue= " as prefix. // eg, queue=DIRECT=OS:buddha\private$\msmqtriggersnotifications // // From C#.NET you can use this function as - // // PalBiswas.MSMQ.MsmqApiLib mqLib = new PalBiswas.MSMQ.MsmqApiLib(); // long count = mqLib.GetMessageCount( "buddha", //    "queue=DIRECT=OS:buddha\private$\msmqtriggersnotifications" ); // ========================================= long MsmqApiLib::GetMessageCount( String *Machine, String *Queue ) {     const wchar_t __pin* m = PtrToStringChars( Machine );     const wchar_t __pin* q = PtrToStringChars( Queue );      QUEUEPROPID   propId[1];     MQPROPVARIANT propVar[1];     HRESULT       propStatus[1];     DWORD         cprop = 0;      propId [cprop] = PROPID_MGMT_QUEUE_MESSAGE_COUNT;     propVar[cprop].vt = VT_NULL;     ++cprop;      MQMGMTPROPS mqProps;      mqProps.cProp    = cprop;     mqProps.aPropID  = propId;     mqProps.aPropVar = propVar;     mqProps.aStatus  = propStatus;      HRESULT hr = MQMgmtGetInfo( m, q, &mqProps );      if( FAILED( hr ) )     {         return -1;     }     else     {         return mqProps.aPropVar[0].ulVal;     } } =========================================   NB: Using this API you will get the message count of only  ACTIVE (ie, open)  queues.
An Astronaut   By Cynthia Wallace  I once wished to float above the earth, so clear and blue But then I realized the trouble I'd go through to float above the Earth As any smart person would do, I reached for my goals with potential and strength and now here I am, floating in Outer Space!  Many of us dreamed of becoming an astronaut when we were young. Some of us never got over that dream. But  John Glenn  rode the shuttle in 1998 at the age of 77;  :-) So keep your dreem alive and try hard to make it.  So, how do you become an astronaut? Few tips - ;-)  1. Learn how to work effectively in a team environment.  2. The "minimum degree requirement" is a bachelor's from an accredited institution. A good "Master of Science" is better.  3. After college, 3 years of related increasingly responsible professional experience.  4. Very good communication skill, not only verbally, but written as well. It's a good idea for an astronaut to be bilingual as well.   5. And get ready for a rigorous training program.  Being an astronaut can be hard o
