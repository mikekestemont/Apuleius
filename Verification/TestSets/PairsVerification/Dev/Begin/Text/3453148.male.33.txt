Fox News aired some footage of a protest demonstration today from the middle east.  It showed children burning the flags of the U.S. and Isreal and the burning of a likeness of George Bush.  When I was in school, I don't recall being taught a doctrine of hatred towards another country or being encouraged to do violence on others.  We all feared the Russian nuclear threat, but none of us were taught to hate and to act violently on that hate.  How can there be a peaceful settlement to the endless turmoil in the Middle East when the youths there are taught to hate and destroy?  I'm the same religion as my parents because that's the way I was raised.  I like the St. Louis Cardinals, the Los Angeles Lakers, and the Miami Dolphins because those were my dad's teams.  I raise my children by the same example set by my ministers, my teachers, and my parents.  We are all a product of our early teaching.  If the teachings of those children in the Middle East are so hate filled and self-destructive how can they ever break free of this mad downward spiral?  A lot of brilliant minds have been working on this global threat for a long time and we have seen no lasting progress.  Will it take an American flag flying over Mecca to free us from this threat?
Pretty funny stuff, watching Miller and Budweiser square off in this ridiculous battle.  The Bud ads in response to the Miller spots are the hands down winner.  Here's drinking to the continued hostilities and to future humorous ad spots!       urlLink Link
I'm having a little trouble getting this to actually post.  Nothing like spending 30 minutes typing an update only to lose it.    Spent the weekend with the kids, had a great time.  Brianne had a T-ball game on Saturday morning.  At her level, the coach pitches three to the kids and if they don't make contact, they tee it up.  She got ahold of pitches on two at bats.  Could be a budding star at the plate.  She'll need to work on her concentration in the field though.  Likes to sit down at second base and talk to the opposing team's base runners a little too much.  Typical six year old I guess.  After returning from the game, we set up the swimming pool in the back yard.  By the next time the kids are here the water should be warm enough for a weekend of swimming.  At about 5:00 p.m. yesterday the rains came.  Had quite a thunderstorm with a lot of local flooding.  Seems to be the routine for the past couple of weeks.  After moving inside to escape the rains, we all set down for the Return of the King.  Brianne promptly fell asleep, but Morgan and I watched it.  He kept getting reassurance that the good guys would win and he loved the movie.  Frodo's late departure kind of bummed him out though.  I tried to get him to believe the film was over when the h
