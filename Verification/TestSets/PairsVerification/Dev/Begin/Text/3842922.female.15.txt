Phew, bloody conked. Went shoe shopping with Hyon Xhi today. I’m on some kind of shopping high. Anyway, the guys thought I dressed like a  slut  today. Sheesh. It was just a t-shirt, skirt and sneakers. Like wtf? Anyway, doesn’t matter. We created a word today.  Ah Hoe . And it’s used to describe people like me. Haha. Anyway, had loads of fun shopping today. We went to like,  two  shopping malls just to find that sacred pair of bloody  HUSH PUPPIES . I was thinking about like, Adidas or something along that line, but hell,  HUSH PUPPIES . Sheesh, unbelievable. Anyway, it was on sale. So it came to about, RM140. I paid half, naturally. Hahah! Kudos to Hyon Xhi, he finally owns a pair of  passable  and  lookable  shoes.  We did loads of shit at Starbucks. We attempted to  con  them.   Steps to rip Starbucks off:   1)	Ask for a cup of hot water 2)	Add chocolate powder from the sugar and milk bar. 3)	Add milk 4)	VOILA, your cup of hot chocolate. FREE.  Check out  urlLink Hyon Xhi's  site for the video.  Hah, anyway, I’ll just let the pictures speak for themselves.  Breakfast for the guys at Starbucks.

And thanking them for not shooing us away as we were fooling around and snapping pictures.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    The first shop we visited. Adidas. But they only sell gHey shoes there. Too bad for Hyon Xhi, thank God I got to save like, 80 bucks.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Second shop we visited. Royal Sporting House. No more pictures of signboards after this. We were at Timberland when some bloody bitch told me that I wasn't allowed to take pictures without their permission. Hello, it's like, FREE advertisement. What's wrong with the world? Hell hath seen no fury like a woman scorned. DO NOT BUY TIMBERLAND. TIMBERLAND IS SATANIC. YOU'LL DIE WEARING TIMBERLAND.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    After many more visits to other shoe shops, we decided to take a detour and visit the Reject Shop to see Hyon Xhi's John Langford briefs! HAHAHA! Saw that? Ultimate coolness.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    At the second shopping mall, finally got his pair of shoes in Hush Puppies of all bloody places. Anyway, it was a mutual agreement.
