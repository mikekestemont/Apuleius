Today my mom and I finished the office! Yay! The fair around here started so I get to see all of the ponies and bunnies! That's basically the only reason for me to go because there isn't much to go on there and the tickets are expensive! But I am getting stuck going with my parents this year! Last year I went with...A few friends and met some there. I never got to see the bunnies and stuff! But I did go on the rides! Well later~*~Lyndsey~*~
Mom mom woke me up at noon today! It sucked! It's summer and the weekend! I think I know what I am going to do with the money&nbsp;I get for working around the house! But I'm not sure yet! Well Im sorry but Im going to go! I will try to write more another day! Bye!
Hey! I just finaly got to talk to my best friend today! Its the third time all summer, if you want to count the time I called and she let me go because it was too late! She is at a family reunion! I feel bad for her, It sounds like a drag!  I watched most of George of the Jungle! Its a good movie! (The one with Brendan Fraser!) He makes a very good George!&nbsp;;)&nbsp;&nbsp;Well I am going to go! I don't have much to talk about! Its still early! Bye!

I hope it lived! Yes, all of this over a fishy!  I had a really weird dream last night! Just down the street from us is a vet, But in my dream it was a shelter and stuff like the ASPCA or whatever its called! In the dream there was a horse that just shoed up and once my dad found out, he wouldn't let me go over there because of it! Then In our house there was like a pile of snow in the corner of the kitchen, but it was outside! (one of the messed up dreams) I said I was going to go over to the shelter after I stood up from sitting in the snow! My dad said I had no busness going over there!
