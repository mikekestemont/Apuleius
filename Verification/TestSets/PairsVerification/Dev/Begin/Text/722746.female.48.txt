Hi! Here it is Sunday evening.  Dave is resting on the couch and watching some boring western!  That's ok because it gives me some time on line.  I must say when I first heard mom talk about her web-log, i.e.,  blog, I thought, "Why would anybody want to put personal stuff on line for the world to read?"  I still kind of wonder that, but I think I'm hooked.  Janice called it her therapy.  I guess I can understand that.  I suppose if people don't know me and they happen upon my blog, they will most likely be bored!  Maybe even people I know will be bored!    Yesterday after a day spent on the lake, we enjoyed a hotdog and brat cook-out and lots of laughs around the campfire.  We got home a little late and I was too tired to even check my email.  It was a good day though. Today we sort of took it easy.  I did laundry, but since I have to turn off the ac to run the drier I spread it out all day.  That way the air was never off for more than 50 mins at a time.  The house stayed pretty cool.  Dave put the headliner in the Pontiac and did some other work on it.  The 'ole care is looking pretty good.  It has been a quiet day and restful.  I think that's what Sundays are for.  Signing off for now!
Hi!  I'm baaaaack!!!! I tried to find Darrell and Dar's place this morning, but to no avail.  Oh well, I came home and cut some more grass.  I'm not doing the back yard until later in the week.  It gets soo much sun that even though we've recently had rain the back yard is already sort of dried up.  Dave's back and we are going out on Sanford Lake later, (in about an hour to be exact!)  It's so hard to do stuff outdoors in this heat!  I mean mowing lawn on a riding mower is not hard work at all.  I'm not bagging it, so it is super easy, BUT!! I'm sweatin' like a pig out there!  Yes, I use sun screen, don't want any skin cancer creeping up on me.  I thought I'd check mail and update my blog site, but I'm headed for the shower!    Alex, I read your blog.  I agree, it is nice with the air on on days like today!  I like the fresh air too, but on a day like today it is nice to come in and cool off!  See everyone later!
Thanks Mom!  I sort of figured it out!  HAHAHA!  I managed to change my name but the "$" shows up.  When I take the dollar sign out I loose my name!  Go figure!  Anyway, it's better than having my full name on.  Today I cut some grass, but not much.  I just did the side of the yard where the horse shoe pits are.  I'll either finish tomorrow or Monday.  I packed the camper because Dave is over at Darrell and Dar's p
