My sites went dead yesterday after nearly 4 years of mostly free hosting by my friend Dan in Michigan.  Lifeseller.com and Soupyet.com are cut off from the rest of the world.  They are penned up in the dark electronic cage of a server called helen in Charlotte, Michigan.  Dan said he was going to try to get a new connection, but it will probably be something slower than the one we previously had.  So, here I am.  Relegated to emptying my mind and thoughts on a free blog site.  This is so humiliating.  It's like a guy who has worked as a high-tech consultant for years and then the gig ends and he has to work bussing dishes at TGIFridays.  That's all for now.  I've got tables to clear.
I read  urlLink Senator Orrin Hatch's statement regarding the inducement of children to commit crimes through P2P networks  and found it disturbing.  Let's apply Sen. Hatch's "logic" to another industry, automotive.  Any company that builds a car which can travel faster than 75 mph and markets it in the USA may be violating the law.  Certainly if that company shows commercials of these vehicles traveling at higher than legal speeds, they are "inducing" me to copy that behavior.    Of course the advertisement will contain a disclaimer about how you shouldn't copy this type of driving.  But Kazaa also carries a disclaimer that says you shouldn't do anything illegal with their software.  The really ludicrous part of Hatch's argument is that he is the one exploiting the children for his own political purposes.  If his argument was sound he wouldn't have to resort to the age old tactic--the same one Miletus used in accusing Socrates--of corrupting our children.  Don't dismiss Sen. Orrin "Miletus" Hatch outright.  Remember, Socrates lost his trial.
I've been dreaming of fishing for quite a while now.  I'm sure these are deep symbolic dreams, because they recur so often and seem to have some vivid themes.  Last night I dreamed that I was fishing, first, in a deep clear pool or lake.  I could see the fish I was trying to catch.  In my mind I kept refering to it as a long-nosed gar, which is odd because that fish lives in the muddy Mississippi river, not clear deep lakes.  The other thing that was odd was that the fish I could see, although it did have the long snout you would expect, was a pearly white and had a blow-hole like a dolphin.  I was fishing for it with a white plastic jig.  I saw the fish take my lure but when I tried to set the hook, it came flying up out of the water.  The tail of the jig was chewed off and what remained seemed dirty.  Next, I was fishing in a muddy pond.  I had an enormous lure on my line with a single hook.  As soon as I cast it out, I had a strike.  I set the hook and battled the fish ashore.  I knew it was a big fish by the way my p
