Okay, so I was reading through the RNC2004 Convention updates, and it seems that 3 days after my posting on true conservatism and not being properly represented at our own convention, the RNC invited several TRUE CONSERVATIVES to speak. I cannot tell you how thrilled I am! (I know it was not because of me, but just knowing that the RNC is seeing their own mistakes is a huge step!) Senators Bill Frist, Rick Santorum and Elizabeth Dole were all added to the lineup of speakers. These are great additions to the other powerful speakers, and ones that may be able to reach middle-America and the more conservative counterparts of our great nation.
I was reading a news article recently that said that in the year 2000, 41% of women voted Democrat, but that has now shifted to a percentage split at 34% Democrats, 31% Republicans, and 33% Independents. Of that though, the vote is split even more. Women who have children tend to vote more conservative (no matter what the party affiliation) because of issues that may effect family and education.  The issues that tend to be deemed the "Women's Issues" are not things that necessarily determine the way the majority of women in this country vote. While there are some who are staunchly pro-family and pro-life, they do not determine who they vote for on a single issue basis, for the most part. The same is true for the opposing side. (6% of pro-life women polled vs. 3% of pro-choicers polled said that the issue Life/Family/Marriage would determine how they vote in this upcoming election).  Ann Richards said today at the DNC Convention that "Men vote Republican, it's up to women to vote Democrat." I've never heard such comment from a 'progressive' woman. Wasn't the point of the feminist revolution to give freedom to women everywhere to make their own decisions? Apparently not if you don't agree with Richards, Steinem and Rodham-Clinton.  The media will not&nbsp;give in to the idea that the political atmosphere is quite different today, in 2004, than it was in 1974. Equal pay, workers rights and women's issues are all important, just not the only thing that we vote for, or look at when choosing a candidate, for the most part.  The most important issues weighing on the minds of American women are the Economy, Homeland Security, and Healthcare. The same three issues that are at the top of the list for the majority of men in this country.  I am not saying that the other issues are not important, because the reason I am republican is mostly because of the social issues.&nbsp;Those issues&nbsp;do determine why I vote the way that I do, however, when it comes down to it, I am going to vote for the most qualified candidate, and weigh all of the issues, not just one.  It's time to look at the issues, and let the media know that Women are progressive and intelligent and that is why we will vote for George W. Bush.
As promised, here&nbsp;are (some of) my thoughts&nbsp;on the w
