A Vote  for life?     By Crystal Broyles August, 12, 2004        Last week during a passing conversation with a woman, I realized that she held the life of a U.S. soldier higher than she did the life of an unborn American child. This realization came to me when she told me who she was going to cast her presidential ballot for this year and why. She said that she didn’t trust Bush and was going to vote for John Kerry. Her reason was that she had already seen what Bush could do and she was sick of young American men and woman being killed in the Middle East. She feels as though her vote for John Kerry opposed to George Bush is a vote in favor of saving life.           When I heard her reasoning a pang struck deep into me. This dear woman along with a lot of other Americans value the life of a U.S. soldier more than they do the life of an unborn American child.           Yesterday as I spoke on the phone, the conversation that I just told you about came up. The person on the phone said, “And what people don’t realize and forget is that the guys that are over there right now in Iraq, half of their generation didn’t make it – they were aborted…”           John Kerry has asked the American people “to judge me by my record…” So now let us take him up on his word and judge him by his record.           Thanks to modern day technology judging a candidate by his/her record is easier than ever. Just go online to Project Vote Smart (www.vote-smart.org), type in the last name of the candidate you are researching and voila, everything you want to know! Or you can just go to this URL: http://www.vote-smart.org/bio.php?can_id=S0421103 that will take you directly to John Kerry’s record. I urge you to click on “Voting Record” – then you will be able to effectively judge him by his record.            When I explored his abortion voting record I discovered, from his record, that by voting for John Kerry I would not be voting to save life. He has consistently voted in favor of the legal destruction of unborn humans.            President Bush, on the other hand, has consistently fought for the rights of the unborn. On April 23, 2004 the Family Research Council’s website reported, “President Bush has never wavered on the abortion issue. From reinstating the Mexico City policy (which bans U.S. funding of foreign abortions), to allowing states to provide government-subsidized health care to fetuses, to signing the Partial Birth Abortion ban and the Unborn Victims of Violence Act into law, the President has consistently fought for the rights of the unborn.”           In John Kerry’s democratic presidential nomination acceptance speech he talked about freedom, restoring democracy, and the choices involved in elections. “They should remember the great idea of freedom for which so many have given their lives.  Our purpose now is to reclaim democracy itself. We are here to affirm that when Americans stand up and speak their minds a
