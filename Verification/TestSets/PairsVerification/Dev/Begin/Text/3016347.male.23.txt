mr ibrahim class ends today, he's a nice guy......an eygptian. wish he could stay here but......nah, he got a phd, there is a better future in uk than here. i finally received email regarding the meeting with my supervisor. argh, i've done so many things and now they only ask me to bring along my proposal and only start to discuss it. damn, the things i've done these few weeks is wasted. and somemore, the supervisor is now mr trevor, he's good in management but coding......argh.......  i havent emailed lai fun yet......maybe tomolo or day after......dunno, lazy n have to do my project in these few days. i'm not mad to talk about it, just too sad. it's like waking up from a dream.....now i just want to be alone.......i seldom talk to anyone these days and i cant let her know. i wish to let her know how sad i am for wat she did but...it doesnt matter now as she never cares. anyway, i am happy now, no stress.....jus....moody....the things we did last time is only memories.........
i finally know who my project supervisor is, taufik.....damn....i wish it was khor....argh.....he's a nice lect but too bad. i dunno how tat guy looks like or how he is.....if he is a pain in the a**e, i'll be dead. bless me...  smsed lai fun again, maybe i should tell her wat happened. it's always better tat someone knew something rather than knowing nothing and judging with wat they think and see without knowing the whole story. i dunno if this is really her but she talked and laugh so much tat it's hard for me to be serious to her. she can be annoying at one time and sometimes she can really touched ones heart. maybe i should find someone like her as a fren, at least i don have to stress on how she will think as she is someone who wont think much when it comes to fren.  i have heard some news of my fren, he was someone who is very ambitious person....and he is one of the first of our secondary school classmates to graduate. he's too ambitious, always wanted to have a good job and high salary. he applied for so many jobs and in the end......i knew this will happened but i do not want to hurt his feelings by telling him the facts.   for me, i would like to have a normal life.....find a job, get experience, find another good job, save money for a house and a car, getting married, having kids, buying education funds for them and then....start my own business. hopefully i can do these all..........haha......
very 'free', i have settled all my things....now i can really start a new life with my frens. i think this might be the last time i am going to old town to find my frens. seow teng really looks mean to me, maybe i really did annoyed her but this will be my last time tat i will annoy her.  i was very touched with w
