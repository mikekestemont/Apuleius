This is going to be a short post, but a very important one.  Yesterday, Emma Stephens was born and she is having a rough beginning to her little life.  She is the daughter of Bridget and Jaime Stephens, my sister's brother and sister-in-law.  Emma is having some breathing problems and had to be taken to NICU last night.  For those of you that pray, I ask that you say a prayer that all will go well for her and her family. So far she seems to be a fighter, so hopefully all will be okay.  Thanks!
Working from home can be a blessing or a curse.  Take today for example--I was at the office again for the staff meeting/retirement party.  We were all sitting around after lunch, still celebrating, sharing stories of old times and it really made me miss having coworkers around.  I love the freedom of not having to get up and travel to work, I just walk to the next room, but there is something to be said about the friendships that you make in an office setting.  I actually worked in the office, off an on, for five years, so I have a lot of friends there.  We see each other from time to time outside of work, but it just isn't the same.  I miss out on the everyday things.  So, it can be a real bummer.  At the same time, it would be a real bummer to get back into rush hour traffic everyday, even for my favorite coworkers.   Good news--my stiches came out today.  YAY!!!  Bad news--turns out that I wasn't having a reaction to the stiches, but rather, I was having a reaction to the polysporin that I was applying twice a day to the stitches.  And, me being the scientist that I am, I had to test this theory before I would believe it.  I have been putting a little bit of polysporin on my stomach for the last few days each time that I put it on my stitches.  As I am sure you can guess, I now have a rash on my belly that is also itching very, very badly.  I sometimes worry about my intelligence.  :)  Feel free to laugh with me--it is very funny.  Additional good news--no cancer.  Woo-hoo!  No news on the man front today, so nothing to update you on there.  Trust me, anything good happens, I will be shouting it from the rooftops!  :)  That's it for the day.  Later!
Today I was in a staff meeting at the office all day.  It is nice to see my coworkers for a change, but I really hate staff meetings.  They are long, boring excuses for your boss to fuss about stuff.  Since I only see some of these people once a year, at these meetings, the inevitable question came up.  "So, any men in your life?"  This is almost always a question that shouldn't be asked if you aren't sure the answer is yes--it just annoys us single people.  Not the question itself so much as the s
