Yes, things have come back around for us again!  I met with a mortgage broker this afternoon and managed to qualify us for an additional $15,000 more than our bank originally would and we can now get the new home we originally wanted.  We got the offer to purchase paperwork emailed from our Realtor tonight and just need to sign and deliver it to get going.  The house already has a lot and a basement dug, and once the purchase details are hammered out we'll be all set!  By the looks of it, we should have a brand new  urlLink Dundee  home by around October 1st.  You gotta love life's ups and downs!
Ok, we declined the afore mentioned house we were keen on buying before the inspection.  Aluminum wiring is just too big of a pain.  Sure some say its fine, but when you ask an electrician whether he would buy an aluminum wired house, I guarantee they'll say no.    Ok, so we're on to plan B.  The market here is ridiculous, houses have offers the same day they're listed!  We're going back to the prospect of building brand new.  My realtor just managed to secure us with one hell of a deal with a new house.  I wasn't too excited about the floor plan as compared to the one we originally wanted (which went up $10,000!) but its definitely do-able.  The costs involved with a new house are pretty much on par with what it will cost to fix up an older home, so what the hell.  New home here we come!  Oh...Just that little financing problem...I won't even go into the scam my wife almost got caught up in...yet.  Sleazy, sleazy business there (thats from the help her parents offered us..thanks again).  Anyway, I'm going to try using a mortgage broker on Monday in the hopes of getting a better deal and higher approval.  Crossing my fingers.
Today has been waaay too stressful! House inspection turned up problems, and to top it all off...My wife's parents are being complete assholes.  Where to begin!!  One of our conditions of purchasing our new home was to have a home inspection done first.  This was done earlier today, and it has turned up more problems than we hoped for.  Our biggest concern right now is the fact that the entire upstairs has  urlLink aluminum wiring .  I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with this risk.  The inspector also found that all of the windows will need replacing, as they are all 30 yrs old.  The insulation in the attic needs an upgrade, and there is an issue with land sloping towards the house in the backyard. The toilet in the bathroom upstairs has been leaking into the surrounding area, and damage cannot be seen until the lino is removed. These are the major concerns.  I won't go into the other minor problems and cosmetic issues that need to be dealt with eventually.  I have until Friday to take it or walk away.    And finally the In-Laws...Dun dun dun.  My wife does not d
