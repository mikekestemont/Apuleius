im just sittin here waiting for a ride to go over lauren's. today is gonna be a really short day cause i woke up at like 1 o'clock. thats probably the latest i slept all summer yet. today pretty much consisted of me saying im bored and hungry, so i ordered from the bm deli, which was pretty good. now im off to lauren's and then around 530 or somethin i have bm basketball sign ups. i dont even know why i bother. but its me, i always end up getting involved with it one way or another and if i dont sign up people will say "omg why didnt you sing up, you should have". amanda and erin are at konobles today so im basically alone, which sucks. i soo need a vacation, away from people down here, idk how much more i can take. i wish i could go back to the carribean with a few of my friends and thats it. that was awsome, id have to say that was the best vacation i ever went on. this year im going to LBI nj with erin, amanda, and erin's parents, so hopefully that will go well and ill get a good vacation out of that away from my family. i honestly wouldnt even mind if i just went to a hotel for a couple days by myself as a vacation.. well i g2g to lauren's. write later.  *LoViNg Is NoT hOw u FoRgEt, BuT HoW u FoRgIvE...

well, i just got back from my game bout an hour ago. we won thank god. it was a pretty good game i guess. im really tired now, and kinda bored. i wish i actually had a life, and at the rate im goin it doesnt look like im getting one any time soon. im gonna try to go to bed decently early tonight so i dont end up wakein up at 12 tomorrow. the part that sucks is that tomorrow is gonna be the same as today cuz amanda and erin are goin to konobles, and im stuck at home alone, with my family once again. i dont know how much more of this i can take. thursday is pretty much an open day and friday i have basketball practice at 430 to like 545 or somethin, idk. my coach keeps telling us we need to get into shape and by the end of the summer im hopefully gonna be in shape. yeah i think its pretty safe to say my life sucks...its way to confusing. im only 14 and already my life is a nightmare. well not a nightmare but still its pretty sucky. i mean compared to how things were before things are looking up. which is a good thing for me. well i need sleep and food before i pass out at my computer desk. write later.
