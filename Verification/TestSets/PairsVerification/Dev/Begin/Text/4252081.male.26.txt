‘Origins of species by means of natural selection; or, the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life’, maybe a bit of a mouthful, but it is an important book for all those thinkers out there. At the age of 22, Charles Darwin went on a world tour with a few of his naturalist buddies (not to be confused with the now popular naturist buddies) to far off lands with coral reefs and dragons, where he met strange natives with bones in their noses and poison tipped arrows. They wandered around uncharted seas in a little boat for 5 years, picking up plant samples, finding insects with thousands of little legs and analyzing multicoloured birds before the hungry cabin boys could put them in the pot. Despite suffering badly from sea sickness and giving up the life of luxury that a rich Victorian is used to, Darwin soldiered on with his project, and returned to England quite the world savvy explorer. He spent the rest of his life recovering from some mysterious Amazonic STD, studying the bottles of pickled lizards and dried butterflies that he had collected on his travels. Darwin also had a few theories on life; how it was created, how it was evolving and perhaps how it might end. He shared his thoughts with friends over a pot roast pheasant one night, which thought he might have a strong case.  ‘You should write a book Charlie, you’re bloody clever so you are’.  So he wrote a book, that even he thought was good, so he wrote another, and another. The titles became longer and stranger, and the discussion deeper and darker with the summing up of a life’s work being published in his penultimate year entitled ‘The formation of vegetable mould, through the actions of worms, with observations on their habits’. I’m yet to get to that one, but it will certainly be next, just after I finish reading the National Enquirer that is next to my bed.  It is important to keep up with world affairs, and following the British dramas of the Hutton enquiry and the American Martha Stewart scandal, as well as keeping up with Jordan’s latest flame and the conspiracy theories of Janet Jackson’s right nipple clamp is nearly a full job time in itself. Reading the Enquirer at night helps with the American gossip, but isn’t much use when I want to know about John-two-jags-Prescott’s latest punch up or Wayne Rooney’s new love nest. So, when some friends came over from old blighty, they were instructed to bring over ‘Britain’s biggest selling newspaper’, the SUN. As the American audience may not know the Sun is famous for it’s outrageous headlines (such as KUNTZ! After master striker Stefan Kuntz scored the goal that put England out of the Euro ’96 championship) but also for the upstanding young ladies who get their baps out for the nation every morning on page 3.  ‘Well fit’, was Jonny’s comment on Zoe, 22, from London. And with 32-24-34 C measurements I could appreciate what he was t
