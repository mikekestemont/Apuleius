Wow! That is the word that best describes the adventure that I had this weekend. How do I find myself cramming in so much fun in so little time. I know that this doesn't really sound like a problem but how can one survive when you are constantly burning the candle on both ends. There wasn't a night this weekend that I went to bed before sunrise, except for Sunday night I guess, when I finally crawled back to my condo just before midnight. Well, I guess I will get to all the juicy details now. Just as a warning, I've added a lot of non-poker related stuff because I know some of my friends that are reading this could care less about that and want to hear more about the party.  Friday, my buddies picked me up around 3pm. and we were off on our big adventure. We made good time to Lake Charles, where we stopped at Isle of Capri and I picked up my $50 for stopping buy. I'm still in awe that they send me these coupons, as I haven't gambled there in almost a year and have probably done this sort of "hit and run" with there coupons for $200 or $300 dollars, but as long as they send them I'll pick up the free money. We then headed over to the other side of the Lake to Harrah's and proceeded to pick up another $115 there without placing a bet. We also stopped by the deli and picked up a muffulata, which was actually very good, but just as a warning these things are huge! 3 of us split one and we still had leftovers, this of course sparked the debate of "could just one person could eat the whole muffulata?", It didn't take long to solve this debate as my buddies just pointed out all of the immensely over weight people there and judging by the size of this sandwich it didn't take long to figure out how they got this way. We finished our sandwich and were back on the road with full bellies and the giddy feeling one could only get from all the coupon whoring we just did.  Next stop was an Albertson's just outside Baton Rouge, we decided that since Louisiana still allowed you to drink in the car that we needed to take full advantage of this law. We picked up enough booze to inebriate a small army and proceeded to do our best to drink it before we made it to N.O. We arrived to the Big Easy around 9pm and met the rest of our friends on Bourbon St. From here we continued our drinking binge and did the normal drinking, flirting and policy of just making asses of ourselves. Next stop, the poker tables at Harrah's.  I cruised into the Poker room, or should I say corner, at Harrah's around 3am and to my surprise it was still pretty full. I immediately sat down at a 3-6 table and realized just how drunk I was. I
