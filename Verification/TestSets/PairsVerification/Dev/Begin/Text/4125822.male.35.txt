You know what the worst thing about Friday is? It doesn't start at 5 pm. The  urlLink Altercation blog  has Slacker Fridays. Since I don't have any readership - yet, I can't sit back and wait for people to contribute. I thought Fridays would be a good day to write nice, happy thoughts. I don't want to leave anyone with the impression that I'm an angry, bitter person. I'd like to use my Happy Friday post to talk about people I admire:    Bill Clinton&#8212;My favorite President. The Republicans really missed a great opportunity with Clinton, a true moderate. But then, he got the country going in the right direction without their help. If he had only been more liberal...   Barack Obama&#8212;The future is now. His speech at the Democratic Convention was...indescribable. I have a little crisis in thinking. Will it be fair to John Edwards in eight years to have to go up against a Clinton/Obama ticket? I'm a little torn. Kerry/Edwards for eight, Clinton/Obama for eight, Obama/? for another eight&#8212;I'm going to be an old man by the time this is done.   John Kerry&#8212;Help is on the way! Am I being a conservative when I think back to an earlier time and hope to see those days come again&#8212;like four years ago?  No, thats no being bitter or angry, it's being hopeful.    Howard Dean&#8212;Gave the Democrats balls. Democrats are talking about a trifecta (Prez, House, and Senate). OK, maybe it doesn't happen, but before Democrats stopped being a bunch of weenies, that wasn't even worth thinking about.   Al Franken&#8212;The books were great.  urlLink Air America radio  is better. If only we could get a local station to pick it up since I can't listen to the online streaming broadcast as our DSL is barely better than dialup at work, but I'm neither bitter nor angry.   Michael Moore&#8212;I'm not always sure of the details, but the message is right on target.
There are fiscal conservatives and then there are social consevatives. Ultra-conservatives tend to gravitate towards social issues. Ultra-conservatives see themselves as traditionalists. They nostalgically think back to a golden age when women and minorities knew their places. Remember Trent Lott's  urlLink praise of Strom Thurmond ? How about Bob Barr's idea of the  urlLink Real America ? Here's a clue, if the person speaks passionately about "states rights," they oppose civil rights.  Alan Keyes is an ultra-conservative. His basic tenet is that, through hard work, anyone can overcome any obstacle placed before them, and that is within the power of all Americans to do so. And then there's the whole national sales tax thing, abolishing the separation between church and state (or whatever). Well you can  urlLink read  it for yourselves.  Will Illinois consevatives vote for Alan Keyes? Which demographic (really, which subset of a demographic) is Alan Keyes hoping to draw from in Illinois? I'm sorry, it just doesn't exist in any numbers. Alan Keyes could not win even if Katherine Harris were responsible for counting the votes. Where is the money coming from for this race? The RNC i
