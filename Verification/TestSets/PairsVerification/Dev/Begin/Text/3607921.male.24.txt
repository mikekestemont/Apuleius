Look I know I say this everyday but its so true.  Whoever truly enjoys their work... (I mean really enjoys it), I am envious of you.  I unfortunately find work arduous, long and tiring.  Do you think porn stars really love their jobs?  Do you think they come to work each day and are like woohoo... I get to have SEX today!  I'm sure they do.  Don't go see "saved!"  That movie made me want to punch someone out.  Its not like its entirely lame, but the people in the movie you hate, you end up hating so much the only thing you can concentrate on is their destruction.  The bad people are hardcore brainwashed Christians.   They should of been vampires.  My bosses are all South African, and they are nuts.  All they talk about are tits and golf.  They say cheers more often than I say "and."  I wonder how much longer I can take this job, its beginning to drive me crazy.  I mean I wake up I work.... maybe I sleep and then I work again.  OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.  My parents think I'm just being a pussy.  Whats up with that?
So many guys just save their money the moment they win the lottery.  Or they get depressed because they are richer than god, or they give to charity or something.  You wanna know what I would do if I won the lottery??  Thats right, somewhere in central houston..... maybe even in my apartment, I'd build my own full sized Isengard.  I mean how much does a tower of black rock cost these days anyway?  It can't be more than a few million smackers.  Is it illegal?  Do I need some kind of permit?  I NEED TO KNOW THESE THINGS.    I'm sure after the tower I'd have a few mill left to blow on hats. But man, if I had my own Isengard, Id stand on the top and drop waterbaloons on losers that don't have a tower ALL DAY.  Better yet I'd put like 30 of those batman search lights on the top and maybe some strobe action and some loud bass and turn it into the hippest club in fucking Texas.  Who wouldn't want to go rock out on Isengard! DOOT DOOT DOOT DOOT (just imagine that). Holy shit this is giving me a headache.  Seriously.... there are not enough cool tower clubs in Houston.
I'm gonna go ahead and write a bit more since its almost lunch time.  I had the coolest dream AGAIN last night.  This time it was more cooler (haha).  Probably about a year or two ago I had this dream about Ninjas fighting on the Eifle Tower.  Now I don't like Paris, but I'll be damned if Ninjas in Paris isn't cool (Sounds like a great movie!).  Anyways, these Ninjas are totally kicking the shit out of each other and they are fighting all over the place.  I mean in the elevator, on the stairs, fucking on top of the shit with the stars and the weapons.  They were a
