okay everyone must  SERIOUSLY  get their own accounts soon because it is  SO CONFUSING  trying to read and find out who is who! okay anyway softball today was fun man x) i must talk about the stupid bus incident we had while leaving NUS. okay so the NUS bus stop we were at had only 95, 96 and 151. so 151 was the bus me, nana and some other people wanted to take. however i was taking it simply because i wanted to drop outside NUS for my mummy to pick me up. well nana they all wanted to take it to go home. so well since we were tired, we just plopped on the grass and waited while the guys kept a look out for the bus. so as time passes, 95 and 96 comes but still NO 151. we get impatient and start complaining then some of the guys suddenly said 'eh 151 here already!' then we all scramble up and rush to the bus stop. BUT all we see is the stupid road. so basically they were fooling around with us. o_0 then when they did it the 2nd and 3rd time nana still fell for it!! haha i didn't! clever me =] well then the stupid thing was that i wanted to take bus out of NUS so it's easier for my mummy to pick me up. however my mum ended up driving in to pick me up because the stupid bus just didn't appear for close to 40 mins. heh wonder how long more they waited after i left. oh well looking back up to what i wrote it doesn't sound as funny as i thought it was, but i think it is one of those things that you must be there to be able to understand. heh so anyway this is my entry of the day. do your homework people. =]
Heyhey, this blog's getting interesting. So many poets actually publish their work here.

So, any interested classmate can take over my post as CIP rep le. unless there isn't anyone, den i have to do the job, k? Basically, being CIP rep is good.
