Welcome Welcome Welcome                 I think it loses some of the feeling after the third welcom :-)
Okay maybe I am not leaving yet, but there is just no really good lyrics that go, "I am currently in assignment committee and don't know what is happening, but I am praying to God that I will get assigned to Uganda."  If you hear a song like that let me know.  I am moving to SB in July.  I will know about where I am working in a week (or so).  Next week I will be in SB working at Community Covenants Vacation Bible School "Mission Possible."  Come party with me if you are around.  I keep getting asked the questions, "What are you doing?" and "When are you leaving?" and "What is that smell?"  The first two I can answer the third is a personal issue I am working out under doctors supervision :)  I am a literacy specialist. For about 500 people, none of whom read this page, that actually means something.  For those of you who don't know what a literacy specialist is please read the following. A literacy specialist is:  some one who specializes in literacy work ;)   For reals, what I do is help people learn to read and write in their vernacular (or first) language.  Within this job title there are many different jobs including: 1) Work on orthography (that is alphabet reform and codification) 2) Design and review graded curriculum 3) Train teachers and writers 4) Coordinate education efforts by government officials for local needs.  So that is my new job and what I have spent two years preparing for.  As to when I will leave: I hope to leave in September for Uganda.  If I don't get assigned to Uganda then I don't know when I will leave.  Also, my departure is dependent upon having enough:  1) Church support 2) Partnership relationships 3) Financial support  So you may ask the questions "Why do literacy?" and "Who do you work for?" and "If I have to smell you I might as well know why you smell?"  The last one is not so much a question but really trying to get me to address the earlier question, but I will not budge.  The other questions will have to wait until the government unseals those files (my next blog I promise). For now at least maybe you get the horribly trite title of this page. Peace for my homeboys
Hey every one!  Okay here is the latest information: I leave for Orlando on Saturday. I will be presenting to Wycliffe delegates at an important meeting. I will be back on Tuesday when I hope to start finding a place in Santa Barbara. I am single, a literacy worker, and leaving for another continent in the Fall  :)               Party on Party People.
So I as most of you know Uganda has invited me to work in literacy.&nbsp; I had several concerns about the assignment, mostly relating to the insanity of a boss who met me and  still  wanted me to work for h
