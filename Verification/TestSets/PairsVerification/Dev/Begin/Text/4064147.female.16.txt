The debate of the summer season... is it To-may-toe? or To-mah-toe? awwwww my fluffy princess Steven and I had the cutest argument in the world.. which kept me giggling non-stop. He says To-mah-toe... but not Po-tah-toe.. awwww and he also says pass-tah instead of pasta. I love my princess so much. he's so adorable. and I'll kill anyone that says any different. I'm serious, I'll hunt you down, and rape your ass with a rifle, and as you are about to oragsm, I will pull the trigger.. At least you'll go out of this world somewhat pleasured.. I know it will be pleasurable to me to kill anyone that says anything against my fluffy princess, or me.. or US. GRRRRR. All of you douches that don't know what the fuck love feels like... its the most amazing thing in the world. so silly.. and fun. and intense. and god its amazing. it keeps you floating. I just might even change the way I say tomato... That.. is a big commitment to make.     I love you my fluffy princess.        [2008 is the best year in the world.]
Wow.... I really hate girls that are so insecure with things that they have a phobia of being accepted by others that don't even know them. Complaining about how they hate EVERYTHING about them, and would give ANYTHING to change it.... but not for themselves... for the acceptance of others. I think that's one of the most self-centered things in the world... Walking into a room, and thinking that everyone is thinking about you. Why the fuck should I be thinking about what you look like? Your fucking clothes don't match, at least you're covering your body. *sigh* Appearance means nothing if you aren't comfortable in your skin. one of the saddest things in the world are people that just can't let go--and allow themselves to FEEL gorgeous. This phobia of strangers already formed "opinions" of you is ridiculous.... ESPECIALLY because you already make the assumption that they have this grudge towards you-by appearance, when they probably aren't even thinking about you AT ALL. Sorry... just. Wow... Insecurity can be fucking ridiculous. and I know that is very hypocrite of me to say--but shit. At least I can feel fucking good in my skin, and not give a shit what others think--I'm just worried more about what I think of myself, not others.. shite. ANYHOW.  ciao.

This morning, I was pulled from my bed, on a basis of four hours of sleep... at 7:30 in the morning. Not awake, or in the mood for morning, I dressed without saying a word, and if one was talking to me, a simple groan, or nod would f
