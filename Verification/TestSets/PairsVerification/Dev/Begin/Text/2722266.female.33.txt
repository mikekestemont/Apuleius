Hey.  Please pray for Jaime, the sister of my friend and co-worker, Jeremy Slagle.  Jaime just had a baby -- the baby's fine, but she's having a lot of complications. She's slated for physical therapy and possibly surgery. And they're about to lose their health insurance.  Pray for Jaime's healing and that her husband, Jared, will find a job with health insurance.  John

Okay--  Here we go. Last friday, despite the snow, we had a great meeting. We talked about the next 30 weeks' topics of discussion, divided roughly into three categories: 10 core beliefs, 10 core practices and 10 core virtures.   Here they are.

From Him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work."

Trust in God; trust also in me. In my Father's house are many rooms; if it were not so, I would have told you. I am going there to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I a
