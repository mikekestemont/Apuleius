Today, I went to Monterey Park with my mom and brother. I did in the end, go to that academy and it turns out that I will be going to classes until my SAT testing. Right now, my scores are on average a crappy 1010, and in these few months, I have to raised it up to at least 1400. I am hoping that I reach 1500, but 500 points in a few months is supposed to be really hard, so this means that I have to work really hard. This also means, less online time, less fun times... basically, less hanging out and being loose all the time. I may even have to cut back on gym time... unless I'm studying vocab or something, then I'll just walk for about 2 hours, while I memorize vocab. I think that's reasonable.  I asked my mom if I could go to that dance tomorrow. It's a key club thing. I told her that I need to help out and volunteer and stuff like that, and she said okay... she believed me. I'm relieved because if she didn't, I wouldn't be able to go.  From now on, less going out, with the exception of: the dance tomorrow, Knott's (or Raging Waters or another theme park), and maybe DDR competition day. I'm limiting my movies to once every other week, unless I really want to see something, then maybe once a week. It's time for serious business.  When going online, I'm limited to: homework (sparknotes, etc.), blogs (that's a lot actually), and minor chatting. Only an hour a day of the later stuff. Homework is limited to 2 hours.  I just hope I can follow these guidelines that I just gave myself. Now, I must play pictionary, as this is my last chance for a long time. Goodbye.
I feel much better today. A few times yesterday, I was on the verge of crying, now I don't feel like crying anymore. Perhaps though, that if I did cry, I would feel tons better anyway, because crying does that to you. They say crying doesn't solve anything. That may be true, but crying sure does make you feel better.    Today, I found out that Melinda knows about Susan's blogger, so Susan's not linking this blog anymore, for fear that Melinda might read my previous entry. This is how I feel about it: I don't care if she reads it. I mean, I don't like hostility, and I don't want to create any, but I hate lying. I will not delete my words out of fear of hurting someone's feelings. The only thing that could seem to have contradict my statement is that I had some hostility with Zuri back in freshman year, but to be honest, I think that was different. For one thing, I was a different person back then, and even if I wasn't, I honestly did want to be Zuri's friend. It was in my nature then, I guess. Nowadays, I don't really seem to care if I lose certain people as f
