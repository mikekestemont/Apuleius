At last my soul cries... FREEDOM!! and i know what it means. I felt more alive today then i have in a long time for some reason. I dont know if its because i have a new sense of life and a new chance to start over from scratch or if i was just unusually giddy today.        "From the moment we depart       We never know where the beginning began or        The end did start" Ahh. to be able to breath breathe anew and feel my soul take flight to the heavens above. The stars are the limit as the first step of an impossible journey begins and becomes possible. For is that not what life is, a journey?
ok, so i havnt written in a few days.... BITE ME! lol. The most incredible thing hit me today while i was getting my dreads done(By the way, excellent job kyla) it was weird in a way because doin this and then shaving all but the facial hair on my chin, it was like not creating a new me but moving on in a way.

When friends are lost, dont try to win them back because if you were a true friend they werent lost because of you, rather dont assert any effort other than that you normally did( saying hey, conversations if they can carry one and want to, etc) If they truly were your friend in the first place they will come back and if they dont, then so be it. I have moved on in my life and seeing old doesnt make me feel as though i am running from an emotionally painful past but rather healing and growing/accepting the future and becoming it. For all of you with heartaches or stress or whatever it may be, lifes to short to dwell on it. Dwelling only makes the pain sharpen, believe me i did it and i know. As i said accept it and heal into the future for change often occurs and if we spend our whole life trying to fight it, we spend our life fighting our own life(if you can understand that).
WOW! Graduation was surreal. I still dont fully comprehend than Im actually free from high school... all the social constraints, all the worthless high school crap that goes on. SUmmer finally here, my last summer with my high school friends. Statistics say that you never keep in touch with even three quarters of your graduating class, my only hope is to find some friends such as the more recent ones ive made in my last few days of high school. Well I'll enjoy the summer, but i cant wait for college life, new people and places, and its odd that life gives you 4 opportunities to c
