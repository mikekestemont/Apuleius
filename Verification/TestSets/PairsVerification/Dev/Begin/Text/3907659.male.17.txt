yes so, I need to do this one quick, Jessica is impatiently chomping in my ear, but anywyas, I cleaned my room today and for the first time since we moved, (3.5+ years ago) I cleaned out my dresser drawers, YAY, ish.  Then I helped my brothers, or rather, Sister Jackson and my mom clean my Brother's room.  I spent a good part of the day listening to EFY music and day dreaming about you know what and such, or rather you know who and what, anyways, we had a court of Honor at church tonight and I got the DORK MERIT BADGES! YAY! Computers and Atomic Energy, what fun!  Played some basketball (chris and I won perusual), then got home, got on here, got off here, called chris, decided to goon the bike trip, yay?????? anyways, called cameron and talked for a bit about girls and the like and then my phone died, and I didn't have my cell with me (jessica had it in the car w/ her) so I got on here and had a jolly good time talking to Carole about situations and computer stuff and merlin about day dreaming and Harry Potter, and KB about her bad day and missionary stuffs, then I let Jessica on and we worked on her blog while she talked with Kelly.  And then she spit on me! Thrice, no, fourice, "snort", fivice, anyways, I'm going now,yeah AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!
well, today I woke up the latest I've woken up all summer and as usual came downstairs and got on the computer.  I talked to people and learned a little more about how to work this thingy from Carole, though I still don't understand the half of a fourth of it, but oh well. Then Katie came over and hungded out with me and stuff, it was fun except we were trying to get the boys to clean their room up, but they would just sit and watch Katie and I working and complain about how hard it was to clean their room, so we left and went down stairs and I made some ramen.  Then I walked Katie home so i could get an envelope and I ran home and found Jessica at the computer talking to my people and she asked why I left and what not and told me that she already had a bunch of stamped envelopes in her room! GRRRR... anyways, Jessica and I spent forever and a day on here talking to people, well, Jessica was talking to my people pretending to be me most of the time and I was supervising to make sure she didn't make me sound gay or weird which she still managed to do regardless of my protests and stuff.  We talked to merlin most predominantly and Jessica had fun talking about bodily occurances that are better suited for william and Nathanael when my parents aren't around or when dad's in one of those "potty talk is funny" moods, but anyways, we "posted some pics" and stuff and sent pics to people v
