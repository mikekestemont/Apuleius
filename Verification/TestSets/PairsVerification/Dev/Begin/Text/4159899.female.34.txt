You play the lead in a specialist team of US Green Berets nicknamed 'Ghosts' because they move swiftly and without detection.  You're in control of a group of six soldiers, and are able to switch between them at the touch of a button. The squad management has been handled well, as have the controls. The variety of commands at your disposal is limited but my view is that this is a bonus, as it keeps things nice and simple.  The enviroments look pretty good, without any mind-blowing visuals, although the attention to detail on the soldiers themselves is impressive. As a single-player game it's completely immersive, although on Xbox Live it is promoted to must-have status. This is what your Xbox was built for.
Even if you're not nuts about biking, you'll still enjoy MotoGP 2. This game offers so much more than the handbraking, skidding world of car racers. It's simple and stupidly, mind-meltingly fast.  The detail is amazing, sometime it feels like you're watching a televised race. Layer after layer of extra details clings to the bikes and the tracks. Bikes are ridiculously well detailed and the colour palette has been used to the full. It looks mint.  The extra effort in visuals has been matched in the aural department, crowd and engine noises are searing.  The feeling of being slap-bang in the middle of a race is intense.  But it's the divine, subtle handling that makes me really love this game. There's also a very deep career mode that will hook you in and never let go. The addition of four-stroke engines means there's more scope for improvement. They are harder to ride, but can offer faster times.  It's also possible to race on Xbox Live and this adds a whole new dimension to what is already an accomplished single-player game.  Add in the new tracks -all great- and the brilliant bike customisation facility, and you'll find that MotoGP 2 is way ahead of the pack, even now.
The feature of Xbox design that comes closest to the player, the Xbox controller is the most sophisticated consule input device ever created. While the control options it offers are available on other systems, the pad has been designed with the input of thousands of gamers, and represents the most complete fusion of practicallity and comfort.
This game rocks!! If you fancy playing an offline game i wud really recommend this,  The story is superb (although slightly confusin at times, especially if u dont know the events/characters of the first game) but its still great fun to play.  The physics r amazing, the lightings fantastic and the open ended gameplay is 2nd to none (with 4, or 5 different endings depending on the choices u make in game).  Biomods r really cool too allowing u to see thru walls, jump higher, run faster, go invisible to people/machines, dominate robots (oooer mrs), u also get drones which help u along ur way,  whether they b a health leech drone (to heal urself by sucking the life out of dead people/cats/penguins etc) a biotox a
