Prepare to lose cabin pressure.....    Welcome to Hell!  I'll be your tour guide in this delectable paradise, where the current temperature is a steamy zero degrees.  That's right folks, Hell has officially frozen over.  Now if you'll just follow me this way you can see our new flying pigs exhibit - oh, and don't mind the big red guy.  Satan decided to help out and start giving everyone sleighrides.....   That's right my loyal readers, life as you know it has ceased to exist.  Allow me to explain: Let me mention the name Karen - now I understand you've never heard this name before.  She is my most recent ex-girlfriend - the only one I ever lived with.  The short version, is that she went crazy - I mean  really  crazy.  She would scream at me and criticize me and make outrageous claims about me.  So I moved out, and for about my last week there, we didn't really talk.  We didn't say goodbye.  I didn't even care if I talked to her again - ever.  For anyone that knows me, this is a big deal.  Then last night on instant messager the tables turned.....   K:  Are you there?  Me:  I could be  K:  You hate me?  Me:  Hate is a strong word.

Time to rant..... Why is everyone so pissed off?  I have done nothing wrong.  MK - If you want to treat me horribly, insult me to my face, and not even apologize or admit that you've done anything wrong, what right could you POSSIBLY have that would make me have to treat you with respect in return?  This is the part I don't understand.  If you want to be my friend, act like one first - otherwise, I have no reason to really want to be your friend anyway.....  Rachel - Don't even get me started.  You have no right to resent me - we are not together because of your choice as much as because of mine at this point, so don't turn on me just because you're not happy about it.  Your jealousy is not my fault, your unhappiness is not my fault.  Enough negative.  I have had an outstanding weekend, and it is mostly due to one person.  Agreed, the parking lot of Jay's Diner is hardly the most romantic of places, but there is never a perfect time, or a perfect place, and never at the right time.  Emily is someone that I can truly talk to and truly open up.  I love looking into her eyes and seeing everything that she wants to s
