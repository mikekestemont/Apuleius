I got to see my friend Jen today! She and her husband are here from California, we (Erin and the kids, Mandy) had donuts and hot drinks this morning. I somehow forgot that I had school today at nine, but luckily my fellow classmate called and told me that class had been cancelled, I really lucked out because I wasn't even on my way! hee hee. I left our get together early because I had to finish some homework before the next class.  I found out today that I have to be in a different school next semester and also a different grade. I'm a little sad because there are so many reasons why I want to be at San Tan: the little girl that I take care of goes there (Brynn), the youngest Cornejo boys (Marc and Andy) also go there I've seen them in P.E. a couple of times, Tyler I have seen there he is a buddy for the younger kids, and also because I love the kids in my kindergarten class, I just love everything about that school. I understand that I have to try different grades and I understand that I need to get a feel for a different school but there is just something special about the connection I had with some of the youth group kids because I went to their school. Also my connection with Brynn because I get to see her at school. I know God will take care of me but it just seems so unfair!
Tonight I got to sing for the Danny Daniels thing, it was neat. He didn't lead worship, I kind of was hoping that he would but I think he is doing that tommorrow. Anyways he was talking about spiritual gifts: the gift of healing, miracles, prophetic words ect. As he was talking I was thinking of a conversation that I had recently with my dad. He asked me if I wanted to go to a Benny Hinn ministry conference he's going to be in Phoenix in February, he said that it would be a great opportunity for me to get healed. Well I am not sure what I believe on his ministry, granted I don't know him, I can see that he does have a heart for God but I don't know if I can go to a place expecting healing, putting all my faith and hope in one event or time. So I told my dad I would pray about it. Well it has been bugging me for awhile, I just don't have a peace about it. But I don't want to hurt my dad either. So anyways Danny D was talking about people how they don't have the gift of healing they are given a gift of healing at that time, so it's not something you have for ever or one person can't have the gift of healing, it is all about God's doing, and if he chooses to use a person then awesome, praise God for it! So at the end he w
