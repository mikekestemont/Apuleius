"I am a banana!"  Peace out.
I haven't been getting much sleep at night recently. Last night, I had homework that I started on at 10:30. Lol. And Scout woke me at 'bout .. 5 AM. Like clockwork. The previous night, I had a nightmare and Scout woke me up .. like clockwork. BUT yester day I took a 2 hour nap. It's no reciprocation, though, as it counts to the 6 hours on the previous night.  ..I don't know how to sleep. ._.;  I recycled today for the first time. I did paper with Tristan. It's actually not so bad. Whenever Tristan recycles, I'll try to recycle. Hopefully I can do it next week and the week after, to count as an ELMO. For whenever I just don't want to do one. And then whenever we recycle, we can get mad extra credit, which is really helpful, especially for this 6 weeks. The High Holy Days (Ira .. you crazy Jew, you know what those are ;]) etc.  -Sigh.- It's hot. I'm tired. Hot & tired = going into air conditioned room and sleeping.  Yep.  Comment if you read this. Ira, Andy, Bob, Shelby, anybody.  PS HOW DO I FIX THIS GODDAMN TIME STAMP?
Mr. Lawson (principal) needs to drown in his own anus blood. ;] Rofl.  So Bob was standing in line for lunch and he opened something up, where they keep food, and Lawson was all "I've gotten onto you a lot last year. Don't make me do it this year." He's such a fucking cunt on quite a powertrip. He yelled at me because my shirt was too short, swearing up and down he's told me more than 20 times. He told me once. Maybe his stupid wooden leg clogs his memory.  Stupid asshole. I swear.  Anyway, Liz Fuller and Rachel whatsherface are going to go down. I hate them both. Rachel more than Liz, because Rachel tried to destroy Bob and I. But Liz also tried to destroy Shelby and Ira. Which is -not- cool. Damn. Figures. Fucking homewreckers.  Anyway .. I'm still pretty excited about my schedule. I mean, Spanish is a little too .. YAY .. for it to be 8:15 AM. When 2nd period starts. All day we did "This is my name. This is what I like/this is what I'm like." In English, we had to do name activites. Getting to know each other. I was Zany Zoe. Haha. And I told Nick to be Nifty Nick and Jaymes to be Jolly Jaymes. And there's this kid, Jared, who was "Junky Jared," but I do believe that shall be later. Okay, well, in geometry (last period, as opposed to English third), we had to say our name and a fact about ourselves. When she got to me, I said "I'm Zoe, and Jaymes is one of my best buddies in the world." Rofl. I'm so cute. ^^; And so about Junky Jared .. we're in the same Wellness class. And he wanted to sit & talk with me, since y'know. We have Snodgrass t
