Sheshkerli nomads have declared war on me...lovely.  Right, I'm just gonna make my own custom preloader, then Episode 1, the Way will be ready. But being ambitious, i'm starting Episode 2, A Saviour from the Way. I'll just say that Rhue teams up with "Red Hair" to save a lady who was taken hostage by Blue Scarves, notorious bandits.  *Yawn* Goodnight, Shecklers.  Tull,  urlLink Black Ghost Staff
