Holland vs Sweden  26/06/04 KO 0245 --->Hat-Trick Challange! Sweden are trouble with some injury to first team players. Anyway the Sweden's bench had lot of talent and quailty lads which will be ready to field up any hole in the squad. Holland on the other side was in better situation when going for selection of players, everyone want to play! Holland is on fire again and prove that they can be so dangerous when they can play together as a team and playing to the coach's tactic. Sweden is unbeaten as they are lucky not to lost against the Italy and Denmark which they managed to grap the equaliser in the last few minutes. Sweden and Holland have lot of good offensive players and they perform better when playing attacking football. Larsson and Van Nistelrooy should get their on the scoresheet. Should expect more goals in this game. As it always say, never change a winning team (Sweden's injury problem and Holland's stars selection problem). Team performance should depend on selection of players for tonight game.   PR: Expect Holland to win.  Result:  Holland vs Sweden
France vs Greece  26/06/04 KO 0245 --->Shocker! France finally played a game that had pleased everyone and advance to this quarter-final match with the surprising Greece. France was still not impressive during the the win over Swiss but they had improved and getting much better in shape. Greece play a tough group matches and have beat the host Portugal and draw with Giant Spain. They lost to Russia 1-2 but fight back to score a goal for advancement. Seem like Greece play better and have more luck to play against Giant team. France will be much happier to meet the Greece but a little mistake from the defence could cost them the game as their defence seem to be unstable. Greece need to perform another counter-attacking tactic in order to shock the holder which I believe they are capable of.  PR: Receiving +ball will be recommended.  Result:  France 0-1 Greece
Portugal vs England  25/06/04 KO 0245 --->Future stars shine! Both Portugal and England managed to win two matches in a row after losing their opening match. With so much young and exprience talents in both squad, both look equally strong and tough. Portugal may have the advantage of playing host with so many Portugese cheering than the English but most Portugal's stars are still not in very good form yet. England's form is peaking after matches and matches and seem like they are in very good state now. Once again Rooney will need his good form to find the winner for England and if he does, England wil stand a very good chance for the semi-final. Portugal need to play at the standard they play against Spain in the last game and they need to stop wasting chances which they are during the Group stage. If both countries are willing to start with attcking tactics then it will be a match not to be missed!  PR: Winner to decide in extra time.   Result:  Portugal 2-2AFT PK(8-7) England
