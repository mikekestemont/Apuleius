Love is slow to lose patience
It looks for a way of being constructive
It is not possessive
It is neither anxious to impress
Nor does it cherish inflated ideas
of its own importance
Love has good manners
And does not pursue selfish advantage.
It is not touchy.
It does not keep account of evil
or gloat over the wickedness of other people.
On the contrary,
It is glad with all good men
When truth prevails.
paraphrase of 1 Corinthians 13
