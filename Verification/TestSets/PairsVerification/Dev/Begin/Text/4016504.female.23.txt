Silence has always been a dear&nbsp;friend of mine yet due to an unknown reason he had left me without bidding goodbye. This happened not too long ago. All these days, I try to brush off thoughts of him, of his sudden absence and why he had never tried to reach for me.   Then one night, I decided not to show up for work, in hopes of finding Silence. I still could remember his phone number. So I dialed the numbers. No one answered the phone. Strange, maybe I switched the last two digits. I tried again. Hoping this time I got it right. Someone did answer the phone. It was a woman’s voice – her aunt. I could sense the&nbsp;distasteful note&nbsp;in her voice when I asked for Silence. Her blunt response was that she had no inkling of his whereabouts.   Heavy in heart, I carefully placed the receiver back. “Where could he be at this time of night?” I asked myself. Then a thought shot through the back of my head. I simpered. Took my bag and told mom that I was going out to meet a friend.   The night air was humid and the dazzling cosmopolitan lights made this gaiety feeling of mine more obvious. I was wearing a dainty floral&nbsp;dress, just like Silence wanted me to wear. People were everywhere. And there was this cacophony of sounds that made it all more confusing. “This is where I’ll find Silence”, I said anticipatively.

There was this bored resignation on my face as I tried to muster the little courage I have left. There is no backing up, I have to move on and try finding him somewhere in this little city of lights.   While walking, I stopped and realized how prickly the cold pavement was. I looked down&nbsp;only to realize that I had no slippers on.   Weird.   All of a sudden I felt a jarring halt of insecurity and shame. “I need to find my slippers”, was my immediate thought. But there’s little time left and I must find Silence so I unyieldingly continued to walk barefoot in spite of the harsh glances I got from the passersby. Every step I took was like sheer torture, as I bear the pang that slowly crept on my spine.   Not too far away is a park. There I saw a bench where I could sit&nbsp;and&nbsp;decide where to search for him. As I went near the bench, I w
