Tired of living a lie. It was great while it lasted. Gotta accept the fact that some things can't be changed. Some things can't be fixed. Some choices cant have options. Some mistakes can't be made up for. You may or may not have slipped, but in my mind you did a thousand times. Coming home drunk at 7 am didnt help at all. This ends here and now, I won't come crawling back no more.. I crawled back too many times before. This is where it ends, this is where it should have ended a long time ago. Goodbye blogger.

What doesn't kill me will make me stronger. We'll be unstoppable if we make it through this one babe. I don't have faith yet but each new day with  you will make me believe. Let me lift you up and help you reach your stars. Let me share every waking moment and every dying hour with you. Let us uproot our past differences and plant a new seed of love, nurture it with kisses and hugs day by day, and reap the sweet fruits of our labor after each passing sunset. Yo te amo mi amor. Let me be your world, coz u are already mine.

It took me 16 cigarettes to realize that I can't force you to love me, that I can't help loving you, that I can't be happy without you. 16 cigarettes to realize i bitch too much, I complain too much, but I'm willing to give everything up for you. 16 cigarettes to tell me that no matter where I run, memories of you will always be a step behind. 16 cigarettes to finally give up and hope that you somehow find a place for me in your life. I hope those are the last 16 cigarettes I have. Coz i wanna make sure I never leave your side before you leave mine. Face it, I'm hopelessly, deeply, undeniably in love with you. And it doesnt matter if I'm not in your heart or your mind. It doesnt matter if you don't see yourself by my side in the happy ever after. What matters is 16 cigarettes told me im only happy when i'm loving you. Let me see you happy until the end of my days. Let me give you whatever love I have left. Just be true to me, coz the last thing I need is another 16 cigarettes. Be honest with me, that's all I have left to ask. DOn't ask me to stay if all I have to stay for is a lie. I want to share your memories with you, I wanna be part of your life. I wanna be there for every new experience, be part of all your pictures. Please tell me to go if all I have to stay for is another walk with 16 more cigarettes.
If i had money would u have stayed  If I had friends would u have stayed   If I took you out would u
