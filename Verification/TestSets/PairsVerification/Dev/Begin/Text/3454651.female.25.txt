All I can say is I work in the depths of Hell!  I'm too tired to even write tonight about how my day went or even why I got up this morning!
I can not believe it, today May 25th and here in lovely Des Moines, Iowa we did not receive any rain!  Its a freakin miracle!  This past weekend was a nightmare here.  Friday and Saturday was super hot and humid oh and did I mention over a hundred tornadoes all around!  Rain, rain and more rain, along with lots of hail!  Anyways enough with the weather crap onto what makes me a Drama Queen?    There is one thing that has ticked me off for the past week now and it has to do with one of the area grocery stores here in Des Moines.  The grocery store that I'm bitching about is employee owned and is pretty much all over the Midwest.  I'm not going to say its name, but if you know who I'm talking about then wonderful!  If you don't know who I'm talking about, then just read on.  It first started last Wednesday, when I to place an order for flowers to be sent to a co-work of mine who's father had just passed away.  The dumb high schooler who was working behind the counter was a real "Peach" to work with, let me just tell you that right now!  Its always pleasant to hear an employee go to you, "Did you need something?" in that oh so pleasant voice of hers!  I was there to spend a lot of money on flowers and this is how I'm treated?  Oh I forgot I'm in the "Country Club" area of West Des Moines, where kids really don't have to work, because "Daddy" will give me money!  That's another rant for later!  I told her, they need to be sent to a small town in Minnesota and all I had was an address minus the zip code.  Little Priss coped an attitude with me about not having "the zip code!"  She ever so nicely asked me, "Is there some you can call to get this?  Because, I need it that's the way we send the order."  Well, you know I would be more then happy to do that for anyone, but not for a snotty teenager who kept tapping her fingers while I was on my cell phone trying to find a zip code for her.  If she was really smart she could of walked her sorry ass up to customer service, where in the postal express area is a book that has zip codes for all cities and towns in the US!  She was a peach to deal with I so want everyone to go there and buy your flowers for this place!     My other issue with this grocery store has to do with their dry cleaning service.  Sunday, I took two of my new Ralph Lauren shirts in, to be dry cleaned.  They should of been back yesterday, but oh no, they now can't seem to f
