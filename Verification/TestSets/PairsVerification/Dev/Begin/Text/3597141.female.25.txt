its friday, 5pm. go home. if you haven't...what are you doing this weekend?
ok so thanks to my buddy anky who sent me a link on a FREE sneak preview of Riddick I got to see it last night before all of you (unless you had the same nice link sent to you :)    urlLink The Chronicles of Riddick  is a sequel to the movie  urlLink Pitch Black , however it takes place five years later, and the characters of Riddick (Vin Diesel), the Imam, and "Jack" return, however the plot has nothing to do with Pitch Black, so don't worry you won't be lost if you go see Riddick. The writer/director, David Twohy, had an endless budget with this movie and it shows in the effects, costumes and scenery...visually its stunning, and at times you almost want to say "wow" out loud...  Basic plot is that Riddick is a Furian outlaw and on the run from bounty hunters and the evil Lord Marshal and his Necromongers who are out to destroy the universe so they can reach the "underverse." If you don't convert to their ways they kill you. Thandie Newton (of ER fame, Carter's fiance) also stars as a hot, evil Necromonger who is power hungry. Anyways, the plot is simple, Riddick is the only man that can save the planets and races from the evil Necros, but is this outlaw willing to help?   I think the simplicity of the plot has been critiqued extensively by real "critics" claiming that the myth behind plot isn't as strong as it should be and that the storyline is too simple? In this case I think it works, the story flows fast, is high-paced, fun and at times funny. My favorite scenes take place on "crematoria," the prison planet, that is reminiscent of Pitch Black. On this planet Riddick is on the run from the rising sun that is 700degrees and in Pitch Black they were running from the dark, it's definitely a FUN scene and newcomer Alexa Davalos is pretty and can kick ass harder than Jennifer Garner any day! Judi Dench (oscar winner for shakespeare in love) is also in the movie as a higher being, Elemental, and very graceful and british in that role as well.   Overall, its a FUN movie, its visually gratifying (Vin's muscles and all the effects), and the end is a surprise! Can't wait till the next one!   Rating: 7/10   WHAT DID YOU THINK????
I think its so sad that Ronald Reagan died when he had alzheimer's, but at least he won;t be in the dark anymore...also it's amazing that people are showing such great outpouring and support of him. he was President when we all were like 3? isnt that crazy? well catarina, you are the only one in D.C. now, whats it like?    urlLink Kerry  is beating Bush in the polls ( 51% )  Are you  urlLink registered to vote ?   I think I am the only democrat in Houston. so weird that I live in Bush country.
oh no I hope she doesnt cancel h
