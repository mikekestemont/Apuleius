Quote of the moment: "I couldn't be happier on my own, but I've got the slightest of a jealous bone and seein' her with him...tends to enlarge it." -Martina McBride  I saw my ex again today when I was taking my sister to the supermarket. That sucked. How can he still have such an affect on me? I talked to him online too tonight. He's still dating his bimbo. Terrific. Yet, if he asked me to, I'd date him  and  let him have his bimbo. How sad, ne? He told me how much fun they're having together, how much he likes her. I felt so shitty. Then he asked about my love life. I replied, "lol." Yah, that about sums it up.  Here's how it stands:  1) Seth, 22, pre-law student at the UofA. He's daringly handsome, and ridiculously rich, but. Yes, BUT, I don't like him. He's offered me everything, and I don't feel a thing. I even kissed him to check, not a single spark.  2) My ex, let's call him Lucifer, 19, Pima Community College student. I love him with every inch of my being. Heart, soul, body and mind. I'd die for him. BUT (that infamous 'but' again) he would rather date his 18-year-old whore.   I HATE MEN! THEY RUIN MY LIFE! I feel like such a bitch for not liking Seth, but I can't help it! And then, I'm still in love with my ex of several months who stole my spiritual virginity and my innocence and my heart and my sanity! Fuck him! Why can't I just take it all back! Damn him!  Well, aside from my love life, my best friend (my twin practically) is moving to Tejas in August and I'm dreading it. My entire family is pissed that I've signed up for the Air Guard because I'll be going to Iraq (most likely) and they don't want me to get raped (little do they know that it wouldn't be the first time) AND my grades haven't come in the mail yet. I have summer school starting Tuesday, damn. I start work on Monday, damn. I am sick of this. I just want to go to boot camp. Daily physical exhaustion sounds like bliss. I guess I'll start counting down the days...G'nite all.
"A million words couldn't bring you back. I know because I've tried. And neither would a million tears. I know because I've cried."    Today has been terrible. So, I've decided to create this online journal because I have no one else I can tell this all to. I'm terrible. I talked to my ex-boyfriend recently on the phone. It was on wednesday night, it was torture. He told me that he and his girlfriend are on rocky ground. Instead of telling him how much I love him still and that I want him back, I slipped in to my 'best friend' mask and told him he'd be alright. I listened for two and a half hours. Then he said, "Good night Crystal, I'll always love you."    What the fuck?  We b
