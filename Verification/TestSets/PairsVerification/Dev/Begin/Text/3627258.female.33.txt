Hi.  Yesterday one of my dogs got into the trash.  All I know for sure is that he ate a Kit-Kat and some chicken bones.  I found a wrapper and I know I'd had chicken for dinner the night before and the chicken bones were missing from the trash. I have 2 dogs and the one that got into the trash is the fatter of the 2.  He doesn't share and usually I hate this except for yesterday.  Not sharing the trash was a good thing.  His diarrhea started sometime in the late evening.  He went on the floor, I cleaned it up then we all went outside to the dog run. (By the way, this little bathroom dance went on for most of the night.)  Quick note: The dog run is a cool place in many ways.  Not only do I get to safely walk my dogs in the City at 2am on a weeknight but I get to chat with my neighbors who are all different and unique and sometimes piss me off and mosttimes don't.    Anyway, the neighbors and I chatted, when we weren't asking our dogs to please stop barking at cyclists and the weird man making kissing noises at them and at dogs on the other side of the fence.  People over 30 who don't have kids talk baby talk to their dogs.  We ask our dogs to please stop barking and say that they feel threatened and that's why they are barking and also talk with each other about how smart our dogs are.  Its a beautiful thing.    To top it all off not only did I not get enough sleep because of the diarrhea but the fire alarm went off 30 minutes before my alarm clock did.  30 minutes!!  Wasted!!  The guy that sits at the Front Desk said that its a new and improved system that's very sensitive and all the apartments are connected to it so when one alarm goes off...They all do.  Yay, me!  I am super protected against my neighbor's burning toast.    These things caused me to be very grumpy this morning.  Now the thing with me is that I have always wanted to be liked so even if I'm super grumpy I will somehow pretend to be happy. (That's very hard to do...I wouldn't recommend trying it at home.) This is changing as I get older.  I predict when I am 60 no one will like me and I will not care. Back to this morning: After dragging my ass out of the shower, dressing, and trudging down to the dog run with my dogs, I caught up with one of my neighbors.  There she stood in her work clothes, clean and wrinkled like one of those  urlLink Broom Skirts  but she was wearing Khakis and a cotton top.  So what do I care?  I, who walk around wearing dog hair like an accessory...once at work, a woman said, "Oh, you've got a gray hair." and instead of a stray gray she pulled out a white dog hair.  O
