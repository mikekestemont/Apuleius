I feel very tired today. Ain't got much to do. Still hoping that luck strikes on me, I wish it would come a lil bit early this time. My life's a jogging track, starts a one place, ends at the same spot, gotta get out of it, gotta do something. I'm not gonna live my life spending most of my hours working with weirdos. BRB
He sounded frustrated with my morning call. Wonder what's wrong. Has he gone bored with me? Geez.. i'm just thinking too much, everyone hates to be awakened.
I don't understand why he gets so terribly upset with the call. It was a good thing anyways. I guess that probably I could rest on it now. I'm too tired to think.
My eyes are blurring day after day. Kinda hate my job now. Hate to wake up early in the morning, get caught in the jam then back to home, get caught in the jam again. Everyday's a cycle. Big company, nothing much to improve, nothing much to care about, just routined stuffs.  Need to think a lot for my kindy but by 3pm my eyes would be dead tired.  Sigh.. Lord pls give me strength
My darling is going to the foosball dyp game on this friday. It's gonna be somekinda competition ..and I'm gonna be lonely for few hours again. Sigh.. I wished I wouldn't have to but I don't wanna be complaining too much. Just that I don't like being left alone.. having a phobia. I mean like.. how often would I be down to KL? I don't like the idea but I don't know how to say no. And it's not an hour or so.. it's gonna be more than 2 hours! Just imagine that he's playing, and I'm beside him looking at him or whatever it is, I don't think I'm quite used to that. I guess maybe he can drop me somewhere at horus and get DC back for wc! hmm would they be around?
So despite my sickening job, I don't know why things are begin to get a lil bit dramatic over my love life. Not quite used to this heavy fluctuating situation. Sometimes he is free, so free I get all the attention for that day. But sometimes, it's always 'brb' and he's gone. But at least he does call to tell me that he's off to somewhere. Guess that's a little credibility I should enjoy, makes happiness lasts for few minutes or so. Anyways, it doesn't last for long so besides sound like a screwed up on the phone, what else should I do? I think it's a speck of loneliness .... the busier he gets, the lonelier i'd be. Perhaps I won't if he could just call at the right time, where there's no 'look, it's a lil bit inconvinient here'.. or 'i'm out so i call you later'. I think I'll just start getting busy now...but how?
Sometimes I wished I could stop working.
I'm not sure if preschool is want I should be focusing on. I need to start it o
