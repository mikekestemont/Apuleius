As of now I cant even check my blog out   so I'll just post some meaningless toast up in this piece.  I'm pretty bored atm.  A little background: I manage a self storage warehouse.  I also live in the apt. suite upstairs.  I spend a .....LOT of time here.  SOOO when 7pm rolls around and its quittin time in these parts I'm on the phone sniffin up a drinkin partner.  I'm 25 and went through my party phase kinda early so I've been on a drink/party/debauchery/livin-in-sin hiatus for a few years now.  So I think I'm overdue some indecency. Plus hitting 25 didnt do a whole lot for my already dismal outlook on getting older.  I 'spose I should count my blessings since I could pass for Shaggy off scooby doo circa 10th grade ( thats when he was still kinda cute in a goofy way ) ..  ( believe me ).. so I gots youthful graces but still feeling the 3-0 creepin up quick-like and a in a hurry.  But I digress.  The reason for all this is as aforementioned, I'm fucking bored.  I tried reading which was nice for a spell.  Gonna learn a few new tricks: Open source operating system, the bass guitar, polish up web design and drawing skills, and learn that crazy yoga trick Will Ferrel does on that SNL sketch with Tobey Maguire.  That should keep me busy but in the downtime maybe I'll be posting here.  We shall see.  Anywho....anyone else out there burning as much time as me feel free to peruse.  I'm privvy to just about all sorts so you might say ... I'm Jesus???
I decided to try and choke out any and all grievances I have with Staci so I can start writing something thats interesting or fun or not stupid.&nbsp; This will be kinda free-based so it might get you more fucked up than usual.&nbsp; Hickies.&nbsp; Once again I shall reiterate (as hard as it is to believe with how much its mentioned) I really dont care that she's fucking around, but what struck me today when she came by to pick up some stuff was hickies.&nbsp; Now this would be a trivial thing for anyone else on earth but me.&nbsp; Why? During the 2+ years we dated I was never allowed to put a single hicky on her not even in unseen places.&nbsp; She would get furious if even hinted at giving her one to the point of ending sex or pushing me off and storming out if we were casually making out.&nbsp; Now I dont think I can recall more than a couple times in the last few months she hasnt had one or more shiners on her neck.&nbsp; Could mean many things.&nbsp; She's tryin to make me jealous (hopefully she's not sinking that low), she's sexually liberated all of a sudden (even thoug without any delusions I know we had great sex), or maybe she's taken a shot to the ole pride and she'll give/receive anything from guys who mean only to get whatever they can o
