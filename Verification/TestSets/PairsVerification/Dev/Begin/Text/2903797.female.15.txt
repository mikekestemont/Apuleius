no one has commented on my blog! not cool! comment! I havnt really done much this summer, but im havign such an amazing time! it came in on me how many great friends i have...im not saying im little miss popular, im not, but the friends i do have are all great. I organized my buddy list into categories, and i realize that although i have amazing friends at school, i also have great friends out of school, and the strange thing is that only one of them is a girl. I think that everybody should organize their buddy list, cos it really made me appreciate my friends. In other news ive been hanging out in westwood more. i got into a minor fight with my mother this after noon cos she said johanna and i couldnt go into westwood at 7:30pm cos we are two young girls and could get raped. i hate that my freedom is limited just ebcause im a girl, it doesnt seem fair. i also hate beign this age, i want to drive, i want to be allowed a glass of wine at dinner on special occasions, i want to have the option of having sex without being looked down upon and called a slut, i want a baby! i want all these things that i cant have just because im 15...it doesnt seem fair, especially as i have no control over my age!!! Ugh! The worst part i think is the driving and not being allowed in westwood at night. westwood is only really fun at night, cos everyone is there! ugh anyways xoxo

Why not think about times to come, And not about the things that you've done, If your life was bad to you, Just think what tomorrow will do.  Don't stop, thinking about tomorrow, Don't stop, it'll soon be here, It'll be, better than before, Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.  All I want is to see you smile, If it takes just a little while, I know you don't believe that it's true, I never meant any harm to you.  Don't stop, thinking about tomorrow, Don't stop, it'll soon be here, It'll be, better than before, Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.  Don't you look back, Don't you look back."   It was so strange cos we were all thinking about how we were going to miss england, and our friends, and familly, and the life we had made there, but they played that song and we all looked at each other and kinda c
