So just a minute ago I had on the "Power Rock" channel on  urlLink MusicChoice  and a song came on which I immediately "felt" was by the 80s butt-rock band  urlLink Winger . Several seconds later the song/artist info showed up confirming my intuition. I am ashamed that I knew this. I'm gonna go hang myself now...
Woohoo. Goin to see  urlLink Iced Earth  at  urlLink The World  in  urlLink Pittsburgh  on June 12th, with supporting acts  urlLink Beyond The Embrace  and  urlLink Trivium .  I have been a big fan of Iced Earth for several years now, ever since the release of their " urlLink Something Wicked... " album. (And have since picked up their entire catalog.)  I just recently discovered Trivium and Beyond The Embrace and they friggen rock. They definately have the potential to be big (as far as metal goes anyways.) I actually discovered both bands while listening to  urlLink Music Choice .  All three bands have absolutely sick guitar riffage, so this concert is gauranteed to kick ass. I haven't gotten to a good concert in a few years now so I'm excited about this one. As a bonus, my buddy Aaron used his connections to land us a sweet deal on a room at the  urlLink Renaissance  so we don't have to drive back to  urlLink Erie  deaf, sweaty and beaten.
The other night, Sharon and I watched  urlLink The Boondock Saints . She mentioned it was one of her favorite movies, and by her description, it sounded cool, so I decided to give it a spin. Basic plot summary (lifted from  urlLink IMDB ):  Irish brothers Connor & Murphy McManus live and work in Boston. Feeling that God's will to rid Earth from all human Evil was given to them as a mission, they set out to do their divine deed. A public outcry is never heard, and even FBI agent Paul Smecker, who follows their trace of bloodshed, admits that the boys are doing exactly what he secretly always has wished to happen. Risking their lives for their beliefs of Veritas (truth) and Aequitas (justice), the Boondock Saints are hyped by the public, for they are doing good, which only few dare to admit.  Sounds cool, yes? Well it is. This movie was damn cool. Lots of gun fights, interesting cinematography, lots of swearing, lots of great one liners and amusing dialog...  Rocco: Fucking... What the fuck. Who the fuck fucked this fucking... How did you two fucking fucks... FUCK.  Connor: Well, that certainly illustrates the diversity of the word.   Fuckin' right.
