So Ive decided to apply for Employment Insurance.  Im a loser. One step away from living in a refridgerator box on Freedom Street. Blah.  Not much else goin on down or up.  Went for dinner with some former co-workers and listened to them bitch about their jobs. Yah, what else is new.   Before that I went and bought some light reading material: The Loving Dominant.  [ which could be called "so, you're dating someone who is weirded out by the fact that you want to be tied up and beaten?] The funny thing being that, shite, its worked for me twice already.  I feel like i should write the author...  Dear Sir  I have purchased your book for the last 2 boyfriends and now have purchased it for the third.  Let me tell you, I turned those poor unexpecting boys from romantic sucks to leash-pulling and whip-wielding dominants.  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. However, I may have a lot of convincing for the new one, as I cant even get him to turn me over and find out why my nickname is "juicy ass".  I am sure, however, that your chapters on converting vanilla lovers may do the trick, as they have in the past.  Your servant, juicy ass.  Hmmm.

I like corn. Im a little excited.  This is from the girl who hasnt shit solid in weeks.

Being that i have been drinking pretty much every day this week, its not that surprising. I think i may be becoming the "Gallery Girl", as opposed to the Rev Girl of 1996. However, I never had to sleep with the staff for free booze back then. Haha.  Last night ran into K... one of the 4 guys i was seeing when i chose the Boy.  He's leaving tomorrow to go back to Edmonton for school, and actually insinuated that he wanted to "go out with a bang". I declined his offer, naturally. [Im a slut, but not a cheater.] He told me he was a little upset that i chose the Boy over him, which kinda weirded me out, but i still think i made the right choice.  Despite the odd problem, i really really dig the Boy and im not giving up on him.        Whats that? I was dating 4 guys at the same time? Yeah. I know, I know. Its kinda what i do. Im either in a relationship, completely single and not looking, or serial dating 2 or more guys. At the time i met the Boy [recall the ex girlfriend preventing him from calling me for 2 weeks?], I didnt think he was interested so i kept looking.  Hooked up with K because we worked together and seemed to have lots in common. One of t
