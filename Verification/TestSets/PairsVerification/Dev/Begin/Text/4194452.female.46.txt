After a day Of great accomplishments And yet of none A day of never leaving And not being worldly A day of not accomplishing anything of material value That will be of benefit To my material progression After a day such as this I look And with great wonder I regard The accomplishments Of revelations revealed Of friendships deepened And of some renewed Of bonds re-claimed And spirits lifted A day when I can see around me The souls I have touched And in so touching Have blessed And made happy The joy I have added The light I have shared And then I wish That every day Could be like this one.   jo smith, august 2004

Too long it has been Thank-you For remembrances For bringing  Unity consciousness at times Of deep distress.  Your golden glow filled my being Imparting a peace Of light and love Removing in it’s wake Tears, Confusion,  Hopelessness.  For you are always close Waiting to hold me For holding is the only thing To comfort this despondency I have become.  Courageous accepting detached All these you give to me  I remember when you left Me here You said Never get attached However, holding lightly With love your only gift.  Now I also understand I am to have none with me Forever Just different ones in passing Until work with each Is done.  Ahhhh, yet it is so hard For deeply do I love these souls Each unique Inner light Gasping to be seen.  Yes ! I see you, Yes! Beautiful, you are If only you could see The view from where I stand You would be in awe Of your own radiance.  And would walk like kings and queens Across  softly padded greens Of  private kingdoms.      Jo, summer 2004  , written for my soulfamily

When love was the only gift, I gave it freely A never ending source I drew from Deep within Across hardwires of black and grey I felt your feelings surge Fingers being interface conductors between you and me With all that is Inbetween Lettered keys and cables Wires silver blue Reached across the miles From me to you. And when you were not there And I no longer here Within my being you stayed The piece u gave so free. Was love The only very real For it passes sight unseen And when aware of you Became my new reality Expansion uncontrolled Caused growth that would not fit Back into who was me.

Finding a piece of yourself You had long ago misplaced When did you do this misplacing? It was so long ago it e
