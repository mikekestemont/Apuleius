my friend and I were walking to school and on one part of our "trek" we have to go down this hill, which leads to a path in between backyards of some houses. So as I'm walking down the path, I see this dog in a backyard. Although it didn't look quite right, it was about knee to waist high and was black with dark grey splotches. It also looked like it was half wolf. So me liking wolves, I walk up to it and let it smell my hand (of course I was hesitant at first) and it was okay. Then my friend tried to go closer but the dog looked up at him and growled as he approached. Then somehow the dog got out of the backyard and next I know, I'm on the ground getting licked on the face by this dog. This part is a little hazy, but I think I was able to talk to the dog too, but I'm not sure. Then my friend said we had to go to the train station (yea, that's a little messed up). I didn't want to leave the dog but I did, so we went to the train station, but I couldn't bear to be away from this dog, so I went back. So when I came back, I saw the dog and then woke up.
Okay so I'm indirectly following this kid down a curving hallway. After awhile it turns into a maze/paintball field (but it's indoors). By now everything turned into shades of black and blue. So there's an empty space with this other kid crouching in it. I turn around, hear something, turn back and next I know I'm hit in the face with a brick.  Scary part: Well the brick in the face woke me up with a jolt. But afterwards it literally feels like I've been shocked by lightning. I was even shaking a bit. It's not the dream that scared me but the aftershock.
Last night I had a dream with a husky in it. It was odd though because the husky was almost albino except for a slight blonde tinge. I feel like that dream was trying to tell me something, but I don't know what. I love dreams with dogs in them (especially huskies and wolves) and never want them to end.
I was at my school and there was some kind of extra class/period in the morning. It lead me to some part near the back where I've never been before, it looked like a maintenance area. So I went down the hall, took a right, then a left and wound up in a room that looked like a hockey changing room (with that black plastic stuff on the bottom too). There was only a few people who were there before me. After awhile more and more people came in and then our teacher finally walked in and started talking. I don't remember what he said, but I doubt it was that important. Then he either opened this door or they j
