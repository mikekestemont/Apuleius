Nothing much happen today, other than a pleasent surprise when carolyn asked me out for coffee. probably spent half of the day watching her copying recipe out from a cook book she borrowed out of the library.  On a lighter note:  I was praying Last night and was thinking about those that I have the most difficult time understanding. Those that hurt us and are not sincere in their love for others, those that are the most difficult for us to love, that give others a really hard time in life, times of heartache and trial, and I asked the Father,  "Why Lord, why do I have to love those who don't love me or make any effort to want me and who persecute me?"  And He said to me,    "Because I have loved you when you didn't want Me, My child.   I reached out for you when you would not embrace Me, I cried for you when you couldn't cry, I cared for you when you didn't think about Me.The ones you have not cared for and put aside as if they were not there were abused by you and shunned, that is how I feel when you do this to Me, because when you have done this to others, this is how much you love Me. The one you love the least in the world is how much you love Me.   Inside of each person in the world, each soul, there is Me, and when you don't love, when there is anger and regret and jealousy in you toward another, it is Me that you feel this way toward, I Am a part of that person, each person on earth no matter what they are or what they do, and I Am asking you to love Me, and to love Me is to pray for each person you meet that the person will become a part of me by loving me and turning to Me for help and peace in their lives. This, my child, is how you love Me, by loving the person that you think is impossible to love, for caring for the person and praying for the person to make his or her life better on this earth. Through Me all things are possible!"    I said,  "Lord, help me! I can't do it by myself, take my hand and hold it, hold onto me and don't let me fail you again, Lord!!"  I thought then about all those in my past that I could have helped if I had just taken the time, those I had hurt verbally, those who reached out to me and I was not there to help them, those I walked away from in fear or anger or frustration and those I find it so hard to love. When I feel His Presence so very close to me His love overwhelms me and amazes me and the tears stream down my face as I cry out to Him for help,  "I love You, Lord!!"  I can't do anything, even the simplest t
