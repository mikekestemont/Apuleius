Hi there guys, Please could you pray for our little church, I don't know how many people I have spoken to about this, so forgive me if I have. As a church we have been meeting in a youth centre for the last 13 years. 2 years ago an Old church building in the centre of Welshpool Town went on sale, with the Lords amazing provision and guidance we have purchased and renovated it. We are moving in this weekend!!! From next Monday to Friday we are opening up the church to visitors from 10 am to 2pm, then having evangelistic meetings at 7.30pm. Then having a Thanksgiving service on the Saturday at 3pm. Please please pray for us.... That we will be ready as a church to recieve non believing visitors into our building and know what to say and how to say it, and that people will come to the special meetings, and that the Lord in His mercy will save people. We are so thankful to God for his provision, and we are now so aware of the responsibility that now goes with it. Lots of people have been interested in what we have done, especially as some of the older folk from the town remember going there as children, or have even got married there. This is a great opportunity to invite them back, and for them to hear the gospel. Any way, thats all for now, will try and update you as the week progresses. Love and God bless, Ruth.
Reviewing what Carole wrote reminded me to comment on our family mealtimes. It seemed for a while that we were eating together even less often than we had been before the holiday - we spent a few days away with friends (who incidentally were eating together more now - their son is old enough to mess up the "grown-up" mealtimes they used to have once their children were in bed - so that was progress for them [and also incidentally we met Aidan Severs and Alison at St. Thomas' in Lancaster when we went with our friends on the Sunday after Carey - should have mentioned that before - small world {or big family}]).  But then when we got home, we just didn't sit down together at all, it seemed. So we made a slightly more conscious effort - which did lead to some times of "family tension", notably on the Sunday (what is it about Sunday lunches? I know - it's that they are an hour later than normal, and people's blood-sugar gets low. Either that or it's a good time for Satan to undermine God's gift to us in the preceding couple of hours. Or both.) but did at least have us eating together! We have used the opportunity of the Olympics to have "family fun" in front of the television, which basically involves us all cheering "Freddy! Freddy!" or "Teddy! Teddy!" at any British competitors that are taking part, with the odd scream thrown in for good measure. What a blessing a detached h
