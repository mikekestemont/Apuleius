Well, jumping down off my movie high, I've decided that it's time for me to keep a journal.  This isn't the first time I've decided this, but hopefully this time I will follow through, since this journal can follow me wherever I go in life.  I've read some of Andrew's journal, and Jared's journal, so in an attempt to bring some coherence to my sometimes......jumbled life, I too will embark upon a fantastic journey of self-discovery (insert grand, sweeping music here).  And to be really cool, and so that everyone will read my journal, I will from now on, use no punctuation This I believe will set me apart from the crowd I will rule the school and win every football game I will drive a beamer and join the rotary and eat lots of spaghetti.........Ok, this offends my grammar sensibilities, so that's enough of that.    Hmmm.....how does one start off a journal?  It's kinda like a first date.  It's a little bit awkward, you need to get to know the other person, there's some halting, nervous laughter, a little bit of fidgeting, and hopefully, a little bit of action by the end of the night, although you really don't expect it.   Ok, dating parable aside, I need to first evaluate my reasons for keeping this journal.  Do I want to seek out truth in the highest form......or simply catalogue (sic?) my life like so many butterflies pinned to a piece of posterboard?  Or am I doing this because I want people to read it, and think that I'm the coolest?  Or is it just because the voices in my head are rising to a dreadful crescendo, and threaten to evict me if I don't find them a frickin' medium?    This is something I need to ask myself, because it's really something only I can decide.  I know that one thing I want to do with my life is write something really great, that will cause people after they set it down, to just sit and stare, and be unable to do anything for a good five minutes but just think.  Because I've read stuff like that.  I think a lot of people have, and the people that haven't.....well, I love 'em, but shoot, that's just sad.  I started reading Stephen King yesterday for the first time, and even though I was afraid that this would happen, I am absolutely enthralled.  God help me.   I know now I will find myself hard-pressed to read anything else for a while, and that's why I was scared to start reading him.  But I was at a bit of a lull, and I needed something to kick-start my marathon reading habit again, and it turns out that Stephen King is going to pick up for me right where Neil Gaiman left off.   I just hope that I will be able to find my way out of the world for a while, and look around, and see the people. Hmmm....Well, my hair is dry, so time for gel.   And time to go.
Oh, man. Wow.   I
