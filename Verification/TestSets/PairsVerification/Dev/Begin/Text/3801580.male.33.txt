So now I have a Blogger account. Moo. I mean baa. I mean, something.   Don't even ask me why I obtained one in the first place. Oh, it's not that I don't know. I know all too well. I was stalling at work. Stalling at work, one of the greatest bastions of creativity ever. "I should be working" shall be the words with which I summon my Muse from here on out. Until I get fired, of course, and am forced to take up a career of freelance writing because no one else will hire me for any reason, ever. And then, of course, I will have to avoid doing that, and in order to find a creative spark I will go have to buck crates of soda onto someone else's truck. 1   In his excellent (and very influential to me) short-story collection  Blue Champagne , John Varley once wrote about type A writers and Type B writers. Type A writers approach their trade with gusto and focus. Type B writers create elaborate filing systems and answer the telephone and the doorbell. I am most definitely of Type B. I have, in fact, created an elaborate filing system for my writing; it happens to work, but it's elaborate. I don't have a doorbell, but I do answer the phone, often picking it up to call others if it means I can avoid sitting down to face the merciless blank page. I will go out to dinner, start new projects, clean the house, even go for a walk to avoid writing. But sooner or later, the page always faces me down, and I have to go back to it.   Also troublesome is the subject of tools.  Henry David Thoreau once wrote , "Men have become the tools of their tools." I am a great collector of tools. Some people can write on a legal pad, or on loose scraps of paper. Isaac Asimov, according to the foreword to the  Foundation Trilogy , wrote portions of it on the backs of bus tickets. In my time, I have bought notebooks of varying size, shape, and expense, from three-ring binders to fifteen-dollar leather-bound  Moleskines  (which are very nice, by the way). I have purchased a  portable keyboard  for my Palm to use as a miniature laptop (in conjunction with Wordsmith Pro). In my time I have owned so many old, outdated, decrepit laptops that it became the subject of much hilarity during my last move; there were at least four or five of them, running everything from Linux to Windows 3.1 to Caldera  OpenDOS . Right now, I am writing this on an  Apple iBook  purchased for me by my late grandmother for purposes of writing the Great American Novel before she died. I didn't get it written before she died. I was answering the telephone and the doorbell.   The iBook uses  DevonThink , a tool pretty much unsurpassed for creating and organizing lots of text files. It allows me to create elaborate filing systems like never before. Oh, thank God. Insufficient organization w
