My group members don't know up to what again. Yesterday one by one tell me maybe not coming to class. End up all came except eric. Fed up with them. Heck care abt them. I won't put in too much effort in my BD. No matter how much effort I put in, they wont accept. My introduction, they delete all, used eric's old one. Teacher already said introduction & evaluation of biz is one page Yati go and do 1 and 1/2 page, end up not enough space. Its either her brain and reny's brains got problems.  I told them pearlyn said, webcam childcare centers singapore have. Reny still uses webcam as our main enhanced features. Then powerpoint slides I completed on monday, but Yati asked me to  wait for eric, because need to insert charts. because yesterday I didnt go, she kept rushing me for the powerpoint slides. I very fed up, I just sent the slides to her without the charts and graphs. She want charts and graphs, she can insert it herself.  The report 1st draft, I saw got grammer mistakes and lots of error.  But I kept quiet, last time the UCCD group project I also kept quiet. Dora told them, report grammer must correct. hahaha When I offered to help, they don't appreciate. What for I go and busybody. Yati kept insisting citation I must put in. But how. Eric always not around Eric is doing the list of references.  Everything is with him. Today really moody, not going to talk to them. I hope.
Today woke up late, at around 12 noon plus plus. Then whole body no mood to move, so snail around the house for a while. Watched the Olympics Athens, my eyes were glued to the TV. I am no sports person or exercise person. But instead I am so interested  in the Olympics. Daydreaming away infront of the TV too. *Sigh*  After Financial Management Class, now at efac doing my e-commerce project part A. ....................Headache Don't really know how to go about. I even promised Irfan to collect data on hairsalons' pricing for him. As a favour, gosh even my horoscope for the week advised me to help others. For I might benefit from it all, I don't care about the benefits I am only afraid if I don't help. Grudges might be bear against me. What to do......... Really like an orange in a foodprocessor, chopped up and diced nicely. Really cold in the efac lab, fingers are getting number by the min. Going off soon.
Its late, but I am still in school. Using the free computer lab access. It ends at 11pm. I am suppose to start on my napster ecom report. Still not a word, I copy pasted some points. Hope I can start writing from there. Cough's getting better less aggressive. Getting slimmer too. From 36 inches, to 33 inches. By tomorrow I had to complete my napster report or the online flower shop evaluation. And start on the CA part b report on bad online flower s
