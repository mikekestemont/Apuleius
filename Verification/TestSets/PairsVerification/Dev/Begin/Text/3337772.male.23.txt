wow, what a evening! After taking Janet's (my interpreter) advice, I went to the Deaf Happy Hour at the Spaghetti Warehouse in Philly.  I met Emily and Walter (who I'm going to see again tomorrow), and chatted for a while.  Later, I went to the bar while they went to eat dinner, and I met Brad - a deaf engineering student at Drexel University, and chatted with him... met a couple of people... there was this gorgeous woman next to Brad, and somehow, she seemed familar... I didn't want to say anything out of fear she'd think I was hitting on her... Even though I WAS checking her out... I gave up and asked her - turns out she's Sally, who I met at RIT during SVP '98.  She, by far, has to be my favorite person to hang out with when we were at RIT! Intelligent, tough, open-minded, and boy, did we have GREAT conversations back then! I wish I had gotten her email/AIM address so we could keep in touch... after SIX years, we run into each other! My oh my, how life has changed us... she barely recognized me (naturally, due to my thick goatee and glasses... it was rare to catch me wearing glasses back then!) mark my words - she is THE SHIT! she is someone you MUST know.  Also, I ran into Katja and Chrissy, both from my old high school. I haven't seen Katja since I graduated High School... Chrissy, saw her a few weeks/months ago... Katja's doing good, even though she was pretty much shitfaced.  Oh, and Emily knows a friend of mine, Chelsea... and Walter knows Nicole Brockman... ho-leee sheeeit, this truly is an ubersmall world!  I got everybody's email addresses and overall, it was a great evening! I can't wait to see Sally, Brad, and Corey again, as well as others I might've forgotten... (I'm fairly drunk after all!) Oh yea, Corey - from Moscow, Russia... I got to speak Russian today! to someone who understands what I'm saying! yay! :-D
