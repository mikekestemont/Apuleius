Haha~ yesterday, i went to watch Shrek2 alone.. Haha.. I dun really know what i am doing.. Suddenly got the urge to watch it.. Had asked yingZ to go and watch with me but she cant make it.. So i went and watch.. Well.. i took a long bus ride..around 1++hr.. It was a very nice ride.. On the ride i learn things.. I give myself time to think.. I start to believe in something.. In this world, there's no one i can trust.. no one really to lean on.. And what i feel at this very moment no one understand, no one can sense anything.. Their lives still go on... The world wont stop when u feel sad.. Yesterday when i walk past a funeral.. I ask myself.. Who will be there, who will actually cry? Deep down i know the ans.. Haha.. i cant believe my life really so meaningless to everyone.. Yesterday i asked Ceyi to accompany me for Macdonald.. He told me he had to work.. Does it work mean everything to him?? Am i so little to him?? Well.. what really hurts was the words he said.. Its very heart piercing.. And what really really made me damn sad was that when i need frenZ most.. no one was there.. No.. at least yesterday kim thiam actually bother to come down and acco me watch movie.. But i rejected of cos.. I cant believe that someone who i seldom really talk to actually willing to acco me thru.. Well.. maybe i was a great failure.. I think i starting to learn things.. If you dun wan to be hurt again.. You cant be what u really are.. You had to learn to braver than u are.. I think i will learn this.. I seemed so vulnerable at this point of time.. But i guess i had to be strong now.. Sometimes life better when u are alone.. Going movie alone.. Going out alone.. You get to think.. feel ur innerself.. I used to think i am very lucky to have so many good frenZ, a nice boyfriend, family and a okay studies.. But is it really true? To pple, some may envy me.. But looking at what i went through is it real? Nah.. like i say.. Many pple said love is like magic, but it can also be illusion.. Everyone love magic.. While watching.. u believe its real.. But only the magician himself noe its not real.. they are illusion.. i really faced lots of things.. Sometimes i really need somone there.. sit with me.. cried with me.. but who will it be??? well.. i guess in this world the word "best fren" maybe does not ever exist.. Often in time.. most will say never mind i was not there but my heart was.. But does it occur to that person.. Your existance now and then make a large difference? I guess believing that u lead a good life actually jus make u hurt more.. I think my world collapsing.. And today onward.. I W
