Did anyone notice my name changing? 6th grade, I was Philip, some called me Phil. 7th grade, I was Phil, few called me Philip. 8th, I was Pip, some called me Phil, some called me Philip. Hell, most People can't spell my name right.. Oh yeah, you can't forget Stacey calling me Philly Cheesesteak. And Anthony called me Philly. And Mr. Porte called me..sigh.. Pillip. Because he said "I was hard to swallow"..
You know, as I was doing about my day, I finally realize, what if.. What if I don't see some of my friends next year? What if theres too much homework? What if my freshman year is hell? I don't wanna leave you guys... I'm not worried about those other what ifs, because it'll just be like starting middle school again, except with us more mature, and older. But I'm depressed, now. Yeah, I get depressed whenever. But I can't stop the inevitable. I remember in 6th grade..  Now in 6th grade, first "new" person I met was, believe it or not, Yong Xiao.

Anthony and his tennis skills.. I remember Armando swinging a chain, and Mrs. Kamplain getting pissed. I remember those rockets in science, and those rollercoasters. We did so much in 6th grade Sci. Mr. Ohlman is my favorite compared to Mr. Mar and Mrs. Miki. At least I can get a A. I remember at the awards ceremony, Mrs. Malloy let me hold her baby, Dylan, while she went to get something. I remember our field trips, to that Archaelogical site, and that Mission spacey whatchamacallit. I remember afterschool thursdays, I'd stay with the bus people. Breon would always mess with me somehow. I remember when Ariel and Jenna and me had a 3-point shootout. And Jenna won. I remember in P.E. where Mr. Tokeshi would talk and talk and talk. I remember when Ricky asked me to be his partner and I said "No." I remember Anthony always going "Philly!" I remember constantly asking Kent what his name was. I swear, I thought it was Ken. I remember Jeffery Aronhalt and his obsession with Annalaura, or was it.. I remember Isaac running around yelling "Dildo" and "Penis". I remember when we did that Elective wheel. I remember how long those cafeteria l
