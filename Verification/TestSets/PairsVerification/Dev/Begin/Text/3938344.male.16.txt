I just realized this is my 11th post.  Break out the fucking champagne.  I now have archives.  This was the first CD I ever bought.  Before this, I was just content to listen to the radio.  No longer.  With this CD, I started a collection that will be treasured and eventually either passed down to my children or sold on ebay when it gets expensive (either way).  Anyway, the songs I heard on the radio by Shinedown were sufficient enough to make me actually want to buy the album.  This review is of the original release, not of the excellent rerelease (I am getting that one too, if only to get my grubby little hands on "Simple Man" and to see the 45 video).    This CD rocks from the first track to the last, easy and simple.  Their most prominent feature is the incredible vocal talents of Brent Smith, their lead and only singer -- any vocal effects on this album, the harmonies, the backup singing, any of that, is done by him.  They also have a relatively good guitarist, bassist, and drummer, but their main thing going for them is Brent Smith.  Now, onto the song-by-song:  1) Fly from the Inside Solid stuff.  This was their first hit, and for good reason!  This is easily one of my favorite songs by them.  Good, unique intro, awesome singing and lyrics, great harmony on the prechorus between the lyrics and general singing, good screaming bridge, and awesome bass and drums.    2) Left Out A much, much darker song, but still excellent.  Good guitaring, alright lyrics and vocals, and bass and drums that blend seamlessly in make this song of revenge and abuse an excellent addition to the album.    3) Lost in the Crowd This song illustrates the lyric-writing talent of Brent Smith.  He manages to take an otherwise average song and give it incredible new life.  This one got more than a few repeats by me before I actually comprehended the lyrics.    4) No More Love I'm still not sure why this one didn't make a hit.  Awesome guitaring, great singing and lyrics, and a good, faster-paced tempo make this one indispensable.  5) Better Version I absolutely love this song.  It speaks complete truth, that no one is perfect and people should just accept each other for what they are.  Great lyrics, vocals, guitaring, and bass, and some incredible harmony near the end.    6) Burning Bright A slower song, this band manages to pull it off really well.  Great lyrics as usual (that must be getting really repetitive, but it's completely true), pretty good instrument sounds, everything you need for a good song.  And with a new version of this song coming with the rerelease, even better.    7) In Memory Most bands crap out at about this point in the album, but Shinedown's still kicking.  Great intro (I don't know how they did that), a different feel, and incredible lyrics make this my favorite song on the album.  That is, until I get the rerelease and I get my fingers around "
