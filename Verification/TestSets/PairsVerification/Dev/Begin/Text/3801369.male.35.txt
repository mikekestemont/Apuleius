urlLink    From a mate of mine, Sean McLeod:  Feel like flying with a Thinkpad laptop? ;-)  A lot of the new IBM Thinkpad laptops have accelerometers in them to detect hard-knocks and to detect when the laptop is being dropped in order to park the hard-drive heads so that they don't damage the hard-disk.  Using the 2-axis accelerometers it's possible to calculate the pitch and roll angles of the laptop assuming that the laptop isn't currently accelerating.  So hooking up this data from the accelerometers into my PFD (attitude indicator etc.) software I've got some attitude on Marcelle's Thinkpad. See the attachment for a demo snapshot of it in operation.  The original idea came from  urlLink here .  &nbsp; urlLink
urlLink War Kayaking  seems fun.
I'm busy reading this great book called  urlLink Genome  by Matt Ridley.
urlLink Java Data Objects (JDO)  also seems like a very promising technology, although the apparently  urlLink politically motivated battle with Hibernate  appears counterproductive for the Java community as a whole.
To allow comments on individual items I guess I should separate them out.  Live and learn...   urlLink Eclipse  seems to be a great IDE. I've just started using it, but the more I find, the more I like it. My suspicion is that, while it may not yet be quite as good as  urlLink Intellij IDEA , it will over time become the dominant IDE on the basis of it's price (free), and support in the form of numerous  urlLink plugins . Also, the fact that it is language-agnostic is a great bonus for us multi-lingual polyglots ;-)

This is my first foray into the wide new world of Web Logs, initiaited while away from my home base of  urlLink Cape Town .  Right now I'm in  urlLink Gothenburg , Sweden, after having spent a week at the  urlLink World Gliding Championships  in Norway, and a week sailing amongst the hundreds of islands near  urlLink Str√∂mstad  and  urlLink Grebbestad .   urlLink A map  will give you an idea of what I'm talking about.  A few more random thoughts and then I must get back to some real work:   Software Development:      urlLink Eclipse  seems to be a great IDE.
