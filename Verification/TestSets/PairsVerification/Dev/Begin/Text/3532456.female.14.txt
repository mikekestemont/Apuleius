Haven't gone out of the house for two consecutive days, Rather like the feeling. Without anyone to be in the house, with all windows closed,just me , myself and God. I will probably become a lazy bum or a bit zi pi if I continue like this...hehe...haven't been studying really...spent less than half the day...so guilty...spent most of the time watching TV or surfing the net...was watching 'Wan Quan Yu Le' todae and they were PK-ing sign language....so funny and lame...Wang Renfu's action very over(as usual). Laughing all the way...and the sign language techer herself oso so funny....a bit act cute lah...but anywayz I think it's quite amazing how God can use every part of the body to show even if u can't talk... Mell...so sian gotta go school tmr...lazy to get out of the house...haha....I am alreadi a lazy bum....Bummer.
A bright Sunday morning spoilt by one comment, shan't reveal what. Went to church feeling a little disappointed that I can't enjoy the church camp...got everybody to try the smoothie but got sum good and bad comments. Alicia and Victoria, thanks for ur encouragement but as for the guys, I've got nothing to say except to resign to fate that it tastes like medicine to you....hehe!! Promise to improve on it... Feeling veri bored now...nothing to do...dun feel like doing homework though I've got loads of it..taking some tests online...checking my mail...feeling thoroughly bored. That's life...period.

I woke up reluctantly this morning, contemplating on whether to go to school or not, but in the end, I decided to open my droopy eyes. I can't afford to pon choir...hehe. My voice was terrible....sounded totally flat.....I guess it's partly the lethargy that is getting to me and my muscles are aching. It shows that I realli stretched for dance practice....hehe !!! Lynn. are u happi???? haha.... But anywayz....I had so much fun going for dance practice yesterday, we learned the second verse and I mastered the breakdance move !!! YEAH !!! KFC for dinner was okay except the fact that it came after 1-and-a-half hours later...I was starving by then!! HEHE....felt a strong sense of satisfaction becos I was the first one to alight from the train!!! Quite lame but anywayz....the youths were going to camp at Denice's place...too bad I can't go for the ice-skating todae !!! Would have hurt myself quite a bit to live up to my accident-prone status....hehe !!! Gotta finish my work...I am saying this everyday but the work just dun seem to finish up...Oh Lord HELP !!!
Went to church for dance prac yesterday....I had so much fun dancing....remember the old days....hehe. Going todae as well...so cool !!!! The guys are so funny !!! But I guess it's still the heart that counts....there's no meaning in dancing if your heart is not there.... The bad thing i
