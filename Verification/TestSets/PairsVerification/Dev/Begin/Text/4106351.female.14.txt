I have interesting friends, that read interesting books, and make me read them (litterally) so then my mom will ask me why I've locked myself up in my room and am yelling for complete silence, so that I can understand the entirety of these books (which include Sophie's World, the Davinci code, etc.) so actual thinking books. My mom will wish to hear about them and then will want to read them when I'm finsihed. The only problem is I use my books, they never look new by the time I've finished reading them. I take notes in them, I underline things I like and put little tabs on the pages, yes this might be a good habbit to keep up, but it makes it so no one can ever read the same book I have in fear of disturbing my precious little tabs. Then they're stuck, because they don't want to have to buy the book again, so they go unread. To make matters worse, I've never once looked at the tabs again. I mean I'm sure if I did I could find some philisophical reason behind why I may have found that interesting at the time, but even if I did I'll never be able to find it again. Then I have an idea of a filing cabinet system. I want to buy a huge filling cabinette and rip out pages where I want things to be, so that I can label them and be able to go back and look at them again when I have an idea. No worries, I'll never tear apart my precious books. Then I have the idea of photocopying pages instead of riping them out, but you can never really get everythig to turn out and that would take a lot of time, effort, and paper. So now what? Keep them in some randome place in the house in hopes of one day remembering the exact book, in the exact page that I need at this exact moment. Not going to happen! So then (again) I'm back to my dilema. I could make use of my bookshelf and put every book I own in alphabetical order by name (because I can never remember the author) and make a huge list of all the pages I want to remember, what book their in, and what it's about. Then make little tables categorizing each section until I get down to a single entry in a book.  That sounds good alright? The only problem is sometimes I know there's something I'm trying to find in a certain book, so I'd have to also categorize things by book (aka: I'd need a subject list and a book list that both have the book and subject just the order switched)  Now we have 2 lists, 2 categories, no filing cabinet, millions of books, and a broken laptop that should be fixed any day.  The problems with this: I don't know where all my books are, I'd have to go through the entire house, clean my room, clean m
