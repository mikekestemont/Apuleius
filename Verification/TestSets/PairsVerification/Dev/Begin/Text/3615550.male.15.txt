This is a blog that is meant for testing.  If I want to make a change to the formatting or something on my good blog, I will first make that change here so as to avoid messing up my blog.  If you read this, leave a comment so as to amuse me.  Nothing obscene, please.
Well, I’m back now, and some interesting things have happened since I left.  Why can’t things happen while I have internet access?  First of all, Bunnie Diehl has decided to  urlLink review  a mainstream song, called Slither  (by Velvet Revolver, I think).  I find the song, though not offensive, to be lyrically lacking (how do you like that alliteration?).  Take a gander over there to see the lyrics.  I find the completely non-sequitur lines of the song to be quite tiresome.  Second, I have several e-mails that I have to respond to.  Lately I have been doing a poor job of keeping up with my e-mail correspondences because of my blog, and that was compounded recently by the fact that my e-mail stopped working for a while.    Thirdly, the U.S. government has handed over power in Iraq two days early!  I will post on this as soon as I can.  For goodness sake, didn’t the government know that they should wait to hand over power until I can write a post?  ;)  This stuff is all great, except for the fact that I don’t have enough internet time to take care of all of it.  My parents installed some parental controls on our computer in order to limit my internet time, since we have broadband.  At press time, I had less than 5 minutes left on my clock, and I had to type the post offline (cutting and pasting to publish my post).    I will try to return to my regular posting schedule as soon as possible.  To get there, I have lots of work to do.      Be blessed! Neo
My parents are going on a business trip for a few days, and I will be staying with my grandparents.  A lack of internet access there means that I will not be able to post anything until late Wednesday or Thursday.  I hope I don't go through blogger withdrawal... ;)  Be blessed!  Neo
Here we go again! More  urlLink hostages !  I'm really getting sick of this now.  I mean it, this is becoming non-news.  I'd like to see a report where there actually *aren't* any hostages or beheadings.    But what's worse than the fact that this is becoming non-news is the fact that there are three men who are about to be beheaded by terrorists.  We see this so often now that it is pathetic, and my anger has turned into exasperation.  How much longer will these barbaric tactics be used before we get tough on those who use them?  The terrorists claimed that "(the prisoners) will receive the just punishment of being beheaded" if Turkey doesn't give in to the terrorists.  I can't help but wonder where the folks who decry the death penalty in America a
