Now back to business. Today i will be telling you bout my councillor life after i passed my councillor interviews. Well 4 years for some would be a very long time but to me i felt that time really flies.      Do you know that being a councillor is tough? Though you think that we only go around checking on people, we councillors too have a set of rules that we have to abide to, or else we suffered punishments. Being a councillor really had&nbsp;let&nbsp;me learn a lot of things. Frankly speaking, without student council, I will not be whom i am today. I changed through the years, from a timid, no confidence, not daring to speak in front of the public person to a dare to speak up person. A more confident person perhaps.       &nbsp;   Our batch was also the first batch that went through the six months probation. I can tell you that my first councillors' camp was really really a tough one. Though i could not described in details but i could tell you that you would not like it if you went for the camp.

Also during the 19th student council investiture, for those who passed the probation got their tie and tie pins from the principal's hands on stage in front of the whole school.     It was an honourable thing.       &nbsp;   I told you time really flies, it was the last camp befor we took over office. I still remembered that camp clashed with my NPCC adventure training camp, that was why i only went for the first day. I regretted doing so, that's the most stupidous thing that i had done during my secondary school years. It cost me a post in the student council. Or at least give me a chance to prove myself that i am fit to be in the main committee. But i didn't have a chance! I remembered that i brought my 8250 handphone to my ATC camp in ubin and hide it under my undergarments to message people in school so a
