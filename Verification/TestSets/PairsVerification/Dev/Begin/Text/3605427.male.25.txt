Okay, so I bumped the Revo in a careless mishap. That's what I get for driving a family SUV, I guess. But seriously, i'm fine, although the repair costs more than I expected it to  : /  A little context, to begin with: I spent my teenage years in Hong Kong and Singapore, in case you didn't know. Both cities have a 'world-class' public transport system, so there's neither a practical security risk  or  a social stigma about commuting there. And so I did.  When I moved back here in '97, I just didn't bother immediately learning how to drive -- I was far too busy for that, and eventually I kind of fell into the habit of being comfortably driven around (my family employs a driver).  Skip forward until early May, when I finally got around to signing up for driving lessons. By this point, I had two factors working against me:  I've got a mild fear of driving that's been ingrained by pop cultural images of fantastic vehicle accidents: pedals slammed violently, brakes screeching, windows shattering, steering wheels flailing wildly, entire car bodies flung sideways off the road, leading to the head-turning spectacle of the flaming car wreck. So yeah, blame Hollywood.  But punk rock also takes part of the responsibility for my aversion to driving. There's a well-documented history of  urlLink resistance to the fuel industry  (in general) and  urlLink car use  (in particular), which finds much resonance within the subculture.  The arguments against oil consumption obviously hold a lot of weight -- from the atrocities committed in the interests of gas companies (think:  urlLink private armies  in resource-rich 3rd world nations), to air pollution, and over-crowded roads. No matter how critical I am of Earth First-style  urlLink direct action tactics , or celebrity enivronmentalism ( urlLink pro-vegan supermodels , anyone?), or  urlLink 'green imperialism' , it's difficult  not  to be influenced by the basic, fundamental practices of the movement/s against automobiles.  Unfortunately, the most common alternatives proposed -- walking and  urlLink bicycling  -- are just not very feasible in Metro Manila. Fact.   You can use a bike to get around subdivisions, or your local barangay, quite easily. However, once you start hitting the main thoroughfares -- EDSA, C5, atbp. -- the noxious emissions from the other vehicles, not to mention the reckless drivers, make long-distance biking a thoroughly unpleasant experience (at best) and a life-threatening habit (at worst). And even if, like me, you can cycle to MegaMall or Shangri-La Plaza without ever passing any major roads, what happens when you make it there? Few, if any, considerations have been made for parking one's bike.  Likewise, being a full-time pedestrian is not a sustainable option, unless you want to deal with the ongoing mental burden of guarding against snatching, mugging, and/or simply being hit by some inconsiderate asshole, when the sidewalk inevitably disappears underneath your feet.  Driving seems like a necessary evil, unless you have the budget, time, and resources to commute. Which brings my over-confident self to the damaged Revo: broken signal light, warped body, f
