And people say there's nothing to see in Ann Arbor. This morning I saw a man in a tan shirt and tan pants get into a tan mercedes. I saw an elderly woman with all white hair pushing a stroller with a small, fluffy, reddish-brown dog in it. I saw a gorgeous rubinesque woman with attitude.  Okay, all these things are pretty ordinary. But they were fun to me. Especially the dog in the stroller.  Galen and I chatted on AIM today (he sent me a message from Tom's computer). He said, "mom," then "himom." I said, "Hi, Galen," and "I love you." To which he responded, "iloveyou2." Not bad for a 4-yr-old, if you think about it: he figured out how to start the chat client, which icon represented me, how to click on it to send a message, and then how to type the messages he wanted to send. Displays a very good ability to figure out how to perform tasks from context. And reading/typing skills. So cool.  Rie came over this morning. She is so much fun to talk to. She might meet me at the gym tomorrow. Galen spent the entire time playing BZFlag.   Today is Wash Day. Fourteen loads of laundry... about a week plus a few days worth of towels, undies, clothes and assorted washable crap. Insert silent scream here.
Went to the gym again today. Galen had a screaming fit when we got there, and another when it was time to leave. It's all about Perceived Loss of Freedom with him (or lack of choice, perhaps the same thing). Came home, had lunch. Kids want to eat peanut butter for every meal, I swear. Then we walked downtown to the library. I estimate this is about a mile and a half each way. Wandered around downtown Ann Arbor, ever so exciting. Visited Tom at work for a few minutes and then stopped of at EA for snacks. I drank a Diet Coke. So disgusting, so tasty.  Walked home and unloaded the photos from the camera.  urlLink Put up some shots of the inside of my house.    Took this on Sunday, at the park.   My son, such an intense child.   Talked to my mother-in-law today. Told her all about the drama with my family. I'm embarassed by it, but my mother-in-law is a kind person. Her birthday is tomorrow.   I think I'm going to go do something now that (hopefully) doesn't involve a computer.
Ended up going to the pool yesterday. Even though my car said it was 79F, when the wind blew or the sun went behind a cloud, it was COLD.

I had half a cup of coffee yesterday. Today, I have had none. I feel like crap. But it's a start, I suppose. Went to the gym this morning. I think I've finally gotten the hang of the elliptical machine, even though the stride feels too short. I have a p
