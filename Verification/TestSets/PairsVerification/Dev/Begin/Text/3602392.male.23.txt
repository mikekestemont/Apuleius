to whom this may concern;   is anyone else pissed at disney for the crappy movies that they have been putting out? they've had millions of classics and in the early-mid nineties they put out a streak of four unbeleivable movies.  the little mermaid, beauty and the beast, aladdin, and the lion king.  disney will never ever again equal this 'streak' again, stop trying because it isnt working and your not fooling anyone. you suck and then you went to pixar to help you make movies and since they have now dumped your ass. so due to the fact that you will never equal that stature again you ruin your legacy by putting out sequels to your classic movies and movies that just have no buisness having one. you made  'simbas pride, retun of jafar, a beauty and the beast christmas, and return to the sea'  just trying to make money on great movies that youve now cheapened with these crappy  sequels. was there really a need to make lady in the tramp 2 or cinderella 2?  whats next.....alice goes back into wonderland, that dork puts the sword back in the stone, bambi's dad gets shot, and sleeping beauty falls asleep again?    what else has disney done to suck...oh yeah you bought the right to the cartoon 'doug' which was a great cartoon then you made it crappy. then you made inspector gadget into a movie.  newsflash  dr. claw wasnt a person. all you ever saw of him was one of his arms...why did you think it was ok for you to hire and actor to play him and show him as a human. that was one of the things that made the cartoon great, not knowing what/who dr. claw is.   disney is working on a law to make it so that you cannot record a televison show on your vcr so you can view it later. they want that to be outlawed and they support the dmca and sssca(if you dont know those are is look it up on google) they also are trying to make this happen. you go to a store and buy some crappy rap cd and put it in your cd player to listen to. they are trying to make it so you have to pay a fee everytime you listen to it even though you already bought it.   disney is also linked to sweatshops in vietnam. the keyhinge toys company where 17-20 year old women are making 6 cents an hour while working 10 hour shifts 7 days a week. thats 60 cents a day. the average meal over there costs 70 cents, thereforth they work a 10 hour day and cant even buy one meal, nevermind a family to feed and rent to pay. they must be proud of themselves. especailly michael eisner....hes the ceo of disney. in 1998 he   averaged $100,000 an hour!  hes made 700 million in the last 5 years. disneys revenue is almost 2 billion dollars every month. what the fuck is that? disney sucks and everyone should boycott them             s
