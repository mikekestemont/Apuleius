Posted on Common Dreams, and circulated throughout the web of late. I read this, and even as a non-american it rings true. If only people were to look outside of their bubbles and be open to other streams of thought. Ah, well, who am I kidding?      How I Will Stop The War   by Chris Andrews, written in March 2003   I wrote this last year before the war started, but somehow it seems more relevant now, people are more open to this type of thought. There's an awful lot of rhetoric and analysis out there, and I still think (like then) that people need to know what to do, themselves, at this moment. And something that reflects some different thinking, approaches. And unless "our side" proposes new ways to think and do, beyond countering the "evil right", I think the average person will stay in their comfort zone. Hope you agree, I wrote it to inspire people. I am convinced if people did this when I wrote this, we'd all be better off today. Not saying that from a place of ego, just from a place of truth, and what other people have told me.   I will limit the amount of war coverage I watch on TV to 10 minutes per day.  Because I know that watching something too closely makes you lose perspective.  Because the economic benefits of war will be lessened by watching TV less.  Because I have more important things to do, like read, think, reflect, discuss. And newspapers ain't bad!  Because I want to make a statement that I determine when and how I spend my time.   I will listen to every viewpoint, no matter how outrageous or destructive that viewpoint seems.  Because I need to understand outrageous and destructive viewpoints to make change.  Because then I can use new and innovative methods to defeat old destructive ways of thinking.  Because I can understand different people's motivations, so I help find new motivations to replace old ones.  Because our world has become too divided and segmented, and someone needs to think differently.   I will study new research and information on people, cultures, psychology, and groups.  So I can choose which viewpoint I want, and not just be the result of what I have been taught in the past.  So I can enlighten other people on ways to think and act, and these people may be "from the other side."  So I can have conversations at a very high level, with people who know that change is good and possible.  So I can truly understand the truth behind what is causing conflict in the world.   I will believe that anything is possible today.  Because war and total destruction are possible if I do not act and do something.  Because peace and prosperity are possible if I do something.  Because I know that it is always darkest before the dawn, and I want to see the dawn. Dawn is beautiful.  Because it is true, anything is possible. I will not forget this.   I will not let anyone stereotype me b
