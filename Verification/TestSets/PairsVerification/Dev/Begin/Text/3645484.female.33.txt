I never saw myself as part of the beauty in the evolutionary change. I wasn't cultivated like that, unfortunately.  Then, of course, I got sick and ended up feeling forever on the end of the evolutionary change.  I pretend though.  It has helped me talk to those I see as part of ascention.  But, the pretending never helps me clue into whether or not they notice me back...  ...then there is Darwin.  I have to see him.  It is a requirement and his job.  He has to touch me, it is his job.  He has to speak to me, again, his job.  I was so intimidated by him at first, I couldn't speak.  Then, I reminded myself that I am so low on the change that I might as well be myself--I have nothing to loose.  So, I did.  I bantered and giggled, shared opinions and favors; I even brought my snotting, weepy eyed self in with a cold.  That was when I heard it.  I coughed and defended the sound with a pathetic, "sorry, I told you that it wasn't pretty."  "Nope, you are still pretty."  Say what?  Was there some one else in the room?  Next visit.  Laying on my back with his hands on my shoulders, "what is this scar?"  "Oh, part of this one,"  I point down into my cleavage. "Where was that again?" he asks in a smooth tone followed by a chuckled as I pull my shirt down again.  I am not too quick on the up take.  He apologized for being unprofessional, but all I could do is chuckled back and excuse him.  He is what Darwin meant when he outlined what should and will survive.  I can't believe that he would even notice that I was a woman, let alone some one to 'flirt' with.  Either way, it is a nice dream...even if I just made it up in my head...
Joan Jett bolts out a breathy and commanding queston, "do you wanna touch, do you wanna touch, yay, do you wanna touch me there?"  A pair of black patton-leather, thigh high, spiked heeled boots are straddled on either side of a golden pole in the middle of a broken rectangle shaped stage.  From this angle, I can see the swelt curves of her milky thighs that lead up to her sweetly round ass that is currently being split up the crack and emphasizing the tilt of her hips.    Waist length, chocolate brown hair wisp over her shoulders and bounce off her extra short, plaid and pleated school girl skirt.  Actually, it was more of a waist ornament that laid just below a perfect 'inny' button.  After making the pole beg for more, she throws herself against the mirrored wall and with a saucey flick of her head, she flips her arms up and melts into the floor...one finger dripping off her pouty lower lip.    A sudden burst of wet comes over me.  I can't take my eyes off of every inch of her.  Her white button down shirt that has the sleeves r
