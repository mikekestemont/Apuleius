Hello from Natchitoches.  Brett, I just realized that I still have your last temptation of christ so when I come to B.R.  to pick up the rest of my stuff ( next two weeks) I will drop it by the store.  Little Jack will be here maybe earlier than we thought.  (original eta June 30 --- moved up one to two weeks possibly)  Life is good and work on the house is moving forward although a bit slowly it seems.  I'm adjusting to the slow pace of natchitoches life again but the traffic is maddening at times. (these people do not know how to drive.  e-mail address is micahdogg88@hotmail.com  The old one still works for now but for how long I don't know.  At least till the end of the summer. Plan a trip up north sometime soon.  New cell phone number is 318.332.8998  Give me a call sometime and let me know how everything is holding up.  Hope to here from everyone soon! -micah
Monday: Lisa opens & Kevin closes  Tuesday: Brett opens & Kevin closes Wednesday: Brett opens & Lisa closes Thursday: Brett opens & Lisa closes Friday: Brett opens & Lisa closes Saturday: Kevin opens & Lisa closes  Don't think Nancy will be back until next Monday.   Damn. just realized that Lisa is closing at least four, probably five nights in a row. NOT cool... That would kill me.
Thats right, i have arrived.
It's a GREAT idea!  The more blogs I can join, the better!!
I had visions of us posting stories of encounters with insane customers, books we thought were worth mentioing in our different shifts, oddball links, and red alerts when Nancy is on a rampage, but the caffiene is wearing off about now.
So I Googled myself and got many hits but, alas, none of them had the slightest thing to do with me.  However, there was one site that listed the LSU graduates from 2002 and there I was!    But I did find a poem written by some 8th grader named Christopher Beaver.  Well, here it is...  I Don't Understand      by Christopher Beaver  I don't understand where the universe ends, why I have ADD,  why I have to go to college.   But most of all I do not understand, why life is the way it is. Why they can't stop pollution, why people need to poach innocent animals, how the world started and how it will end.   What I understand most are kids with ADD, who are hyper. They can't keep up. They're called stupid. The teachers don't quite understand them. It takes them more time to understand things.  I understand why it's harder for me to understand.
Long promised,  urlLink here it is.
We've been having some real "quality" posts over last night, wouldn't you all agree? I think I'll start posting EVERY conversation I have with EVERYBODY... All in the name of entertainment value, of course!   Also, I vow to learn how to make Flash animations in the next month so I can convey to all of you who weren't present the greatness that was Brett's sheep s
