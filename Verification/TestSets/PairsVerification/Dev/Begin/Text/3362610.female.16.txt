So I had a pretty uneventful weekend. It was fun tho. Saturday night, I went up to the Z's house for awhile with my dad. Then Kait came over and we just talked for like 4 hours and then went to sleep. We woke up at like 8:30 and went and got donuts while we were still in our pajamas. It was great. We were walkin through King Soopers wearing our matching weiner dog pants. All these lil kids were like makin fun of us, but we just laughed the whole time. Until we saw Mr. Murphy there. That was kinda freaky but o well. Then Sunday I just kinda laid around and came to my moms house and hung out. I met Louie, Ryan and Meghan at the park at like 1 in the mornin. We were layin in the grass lookin at the clouds and the sprinklers went off! I was soaking wet and Louie just laughed! Jackass. But we had fun. And then I had to come home and I slept until 2 this afternoon. It was awesome. Etta made me get up and go to lunch with her and mom. We went to Woody's. Then I dropped em off at home and went and changed clothes at my dads and then I picked up Kait and we came back here. We picked up the mothers and went down to watch the bike racing in Golden. Alex competed in his first pro race ever! It was awesome to watch him! We also met this guy Jared....hes our new big brother according to the sisters. Kait came back over and we had some more bonding time. It was fun. Its really great to be getting so close to her again. I think I have decided who I like but I'm not sure. Boys are so stupid. Matt called me and wanted to hang out but that didnt happen. Surprise surprise. Im going guy hunting this summer and Im gonna find cute ones. Man i want Calvin soo bad! I hope that works out! Alright well Im off to bed. Nighty night. ~*Chels*~
So school is out. It's a bittersweet feeling. I truly miss seeing my friends every day. My last day was really fun tho. I'm gonna be Blincoe's student assistant next year. That excites me cuz I love Blincoe. He's like the coolest teacher ever! And then in photo i just screwed around the whole time. Off block was a lotta fun cuz Mel and Mone came over and we just messed around. Then English was awesome cuz me and Kait and Rissa were just bein dumb the whole time. I'm not friends with Amber and Lindsey anymore. I'm actually pretty happy about that because they are complete and total backstabbers.  They were basically just using me for my house. I wont put up with that from anyone so that doesnt really upset me. I found out they have been talkin shit about me. I really love how girls are so damn two faced. Like seriously its just a
