I am buying a ~$250 MTB bike on Saturday. I will shock you by saying this is my new commute bike (i don't own a car). Actually the Felt is a better bike, but there is nowhere to change and shower at work, so I am getting a real easy ride for work. Yeah, yeah i am dumber than box of rocks, but the roadie stuff is for the weekends for now. And this new bike will not have clipless pedals (for now).  My rotation has been Sahara Hotnights, Hives, Mooney Suzuki, Black Keys, White Stripes, Radiohead, REM, Velvet Undeground and Pixies (live at coachella). Pretty different, but Hives and Sahara I just saw and both were great. Mooney Suzuki kicks ass, and i saw the Black Keys at coachella and am seeing then again on the 9th of September (at the Fillmore!). REM is okay in my book, and well Velvet Underground are cooooooool. and pixies, well go fuck a goat if you don't like them, or send me the goat an I'll change into an angel, or a beast that brings about the end of the world...  "its not the fall of your empire, the end of your world, i say it will pass, you say this time its neverending, you say its elusive, It's out of your reach, I say the solution might be closer than it seems" - Maria Elisabeth Andersson - Vocals and Lead guitar, Sahara Hotnights  Your idiot in Spain, Sam
I fell over again today, and now I really know what pain is. My left knee has a big bruise and sends me pain messages whenever I get my butt up of the sofa. I don't think that anything's broken (in my knee), but I hate winceing whenever I extend it. Not good.  I must thank the driver that caused me to fall though. He was most helpful by driving around me (i take MY lane, one away from car doors opening up) and then making a right turn in front of me while I was unclipping and braking hard. That got my weight on the wrong side and I just went down hard. I am pretty skinny so it hurt. I was okay at work, but on the way home my knee kept hurting more and more, and now its painful. Luckily though I had the tights on so not much skin was ripped off, but my knee doesn't care now. Thanks Jackass! Hope you were late to work and got fired and your car caught on fire on the way home, etc.  So now my manefesto on drivers vs. bicyclists. 1.) We share the same space on the road, if I ride in "your lane" please excuse me, a car door opening and catching me could, literaly, kill me. 2.) Your car goes faster than my bike, so pass me when its safe. I have the same right to the road that you do. 3.) Not all people who ride bikes are the same, I obey traffic laws, some people on "bikes" d
