Another day.  Grocery shopping.  Searching for pants online because Matt is a skinny dude.   Maybe going to a barbeque later tonight.  Fun times.
Go Wolverines!  I have to admit that when I realized what a perfect football day it was today (70 degrees and sunny), I was bummed that I didn't get season tickets this year.  But, I watched the game on my fuzzy TV and was glad to see Michigan do some stompin'.  Hopefully the rest of the Big Ten can step up to the plate, too.  I was reading Matt's Northwestern magazine today (the alumni association hasn't figured out where I live yet), and I never cease to be amazed by how ridiculous some people are.  The last ten or so pages of the magazine are dedicated to alumni notes, which include weddings/births/deaths, but also random things sent in by alumni.  I mean, we have so-and-so from WCAS01 who sends in a note that they are now working for Kraft as a "cheese consumer data analyst."  Who the hell cares??  If it was a joke, it would be one thing, but it seemed totally serious (as it was paired with an announcement about what the person's fiancee was doing).  Matt joked that he should send in a note to say that he is now a cheese consumer and see if they'd publish it.  If you're actually doing something cool with your life, by all means tell the world.  But if your job sucks, why advertise it?   So while I can't say that I've completely gotten over my addiction to email (I checked yesterday and I've actually sent something like 150 emails in the month I've been home), I've gotten to the point where I'm less enthused, probably because no one is emailing me back.  But, once again, not everyone is as psycho as me.  And I suppose it's true that once classes start, I'm just as bad as everyone else.  Only three more days...
I promised myself I would be productive today.  To that end, I did some laundry and washed the dishes.  And read something like 15 pages of an article on formation processes.  But after lunch I kind of gave up.  I took a nap and then wasted yet more time on Friendster.  I'm up to 14 friendsters.  Yay.  I even found some people from the fencing team at NU.  Ah, those were the days.  I attempted to Google myself yesterday (hard to do when you have a name like Jamie Clark, as there are millions of us), but I did find a link to the old fencing website that had my record from 1999.  1-6.  Yep, a grand .143.  Boy I sucked.  Someone this summer suggested that I start fencing again, and Michigan does have a club team, but I don't think it's worth my time.  I should find an extracurricular activity tho, outside of my Yoga and Butts/Guts classes at CCRB.  I'm thinking maybe Habitat for Humanity, although Matt made fun of me when I suggested it since I clearly don't know anything about carpentry.  We'll s
