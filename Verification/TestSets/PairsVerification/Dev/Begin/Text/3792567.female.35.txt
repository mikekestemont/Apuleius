Someone asks you for a letter of recommendation.&nbsp; The job she seeks will probably be in the same field.&nbsp; How do you do it when you have nothing to say?&nbsp; I can say she's a good Mom, she has a great heart.&nbsp; She is reliable and she has good organizational skills.   What she doesnt have is the ability to work with others.&nbsp; Patience.&nbsp; Zip on the problem solving skills.&nbsp; She has a short fuse and a heavy mouth.&nbsp;   Maybe this is only because she hates her job.&nbsp; Maybe its the reason why she has decided to leave.&nbsp;   But - I cannot in good heart and mind put that in writing for the next employer.&nbsp; I would be lying.&nbsp;   Thats what she has given me - and it is what I have seen.  If she was so awful - why did she stay employed for so long?&nbsp; She's not awful or maybe we have just learned how to get around her moods.&nbsp; In the end things get done - but at a price.  I am confused and feel badly that I cannot give a gleaming review.&nbsp; I don't want to hurt anyones feelings or chances at gaining employement for themselves.&nbsp; But - I don't want to be the reason someone hires someone.&nbsp; My word is good in this business.&nbsp; Good as gold.&nbsp;   Does that mean that any employees we hire in the future you keep&nbsp;at arms length?&nbsp; Can that be done in an office so small?&nbsp; Is that what "I am the boss" means?  It's a very sticky situation and honesty is always the best policy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Uggghhhh!!!!  I need a beer.  &nbsp;
Ok - a couple of posts back I said Hope - its Help.&nbsp; So that I don't misrepresent the DNC Candidates.&nbsp; God Forbid.
I don't think anyone has been&nbsp;interested in my&nbsp;'going' since I was a baby.  You know when your Mom makes sure you 'go'?&nbsp; Makes comments about it. Or, when you don't 'go'&nbsp;they get all concerned.&nbsp; "She has a bellyache today - she hasnt 'gone'."  But my 'going' has become common talk.&nbsp; Why, because I suffer from IBS.&nbsp;   IBS stands for Irritating Bull Shit (not really - but I seem to scream that when running for the can).  If you've never experienced this 'syndrome' your really missing out.&nbsp; It's a joy.&nbsp; Things that you would never think of become regular staples in your car.&nbsp; A bucket, some toilet paper, baby wipes&nbsp;and a change of clothes.&nbsp; You become a major share holder in Imodium AD Extra Strength.&nbsp; You know every&nbsp;can available from here to there and you dont even care if it hasn't been cleaned in a year.&nbsp;   Your family and co-workers know that when you say pull-over you mean NOW!&nbsp;  You consider diapers - but you still have enough pride left to not get them  There is no cure.&nbsp; They blame diet, stress, lifestyle.&nbsp; So one by one - you eliminate all the things they say that trigger you.&nbsp; Nothing works.&nbsp; So you work around it.&nbsp; You learn to live with it. Its on your mind - every day - e
