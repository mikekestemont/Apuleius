Yesterday was okay. I didn't blog. 'Cos I went outside and played hockey... or rather just hung around. Haha... Since I went outside, my mom wouldn't let me on the computer. -___-" Gayness. But I snuck online and read his blog since he blogged. Tsk tsk tsk... he only blogs when something big happens or whatever. Well, I guess everything's okay. He called yesterday and we talked for a while. Again, he only seems to call when something happens... -____-" Like when he called to clearify the whole Shar thing and also when he asked me out... and now to ask about what was wrong. Blahness... -__-" Oh well... I guess things are okay now and stuff. I miss him... >O  Today was Hoops4Heart. We had a 3 on 3 tournament. My team won. [Yay! We won last year too!] and Nima's team didn't win... but he did really well. I was watching when I wasn't playing... and sometimes when I  was  playing. Hee hee~ *achoozZ* My deo is making me sneeze... baby powder scent... haha...! Nothing too flowery. Blahness... =/   Hmm, Erica told me about some Marcos dude. He sounds really funny. Godfrey asked me if I knew Marcos today on MSN. I THINK I know Marcos. They say his name is Marcos Ho. I dunno... I really wanna meet him though. So I'll be going to Sunday Worship whether I get a ride or not! 'Cos I really wanna meet this Marcos Ho dude! I knew a Marcos Ho from kindergarten! Hee hee! It'd be cool if I really do know him from before though! MuahahahazZ~! Anyways... Gotta go... If you're reading this, Nima... I love you ;)
Went to school today... as usual. Math test... I think I failed. Blah... I asked Nima why he wasn't at basketball and he said it was because his sister got in a car crash and stuff so he didn't go... he couldn't call like he said either 'cos of that. Haha... Blah... I just hope everything's alright. I talked on MSN a bit, and Candace mentioned something about walking home with Nima, Jordan, Safee, and people and that Nima was acting weird...? She said he wasn't acting like himself and was being mean... mean but not rude. I asked how and she just said he was poking people really hard and being serious and secretive... ookay? Well whatever it is that's making him do that... I hope it's not bad. Nima... he has changed a lot lately. It's just... blah. I hope it's not a bad thing. Guys really need to figure out how to handle their anger sometimes... not just anger, but emotions in general. Blah... weird. He said he'd call tonight but will he remember? Hmm... Blah. Tonight's Literacy Night...~ I wanted to go but I forgot to tell Rodway that I could help out. Oh well... I'll stay home instead. My sister's there to help out tonight.   Kortright tomorrow. Gonna bring money to buy stuff at the canteen. Don't want to bring a lunch. Too "mah fan". Aish... I
