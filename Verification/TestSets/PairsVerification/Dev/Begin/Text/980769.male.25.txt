In politics there are certain goals, such as a "balanced budget" or "energy independence," that are so lofty that any politician who promises them is talking nonsense and deserves the mute button. Something similar should happen in religious debate to people who talk about "Torah-based" Judaism.  That is the chimera Dennis Prager calls for in this month's Moment magazine. He believes it&nbsp;"could bring vast numbers of non-religious Jews to Judaism." Specifically, Prager calls for a "Torah-based Judaism which honors rabbinic law but doesn't deify it," which, at a moment's glance, seems to make a dash of sense. Certainly it doesn't describe any of&nbsp;three major&nbsp;branches of Judaism; all three claim to&nbsp;take both the Torah seriously, but take cues from it selectively and are inspired primarily by the Talmud.  Prager correctly cites several instances where&nbsp;modernity has made&nbsp;a mockery of rabbinic law: "I see no reason to believe that&nbsp;kosher food is rendered non-kosher because the clean dish on which it is served to me once had non-kosher food on it." Of course, there is no good reason to believe this. But neither is there&nbsp;any good reason to believe, as Prager apparently does, that nothing in&nbsp;the last 3,000 years&nbsp;- not refrigeration technology, or the germ theory of disease, or the&nbsp;use of more sanitary eating utensils - renders any of the Torah's commandments about kashruth&nbsp;obsolete. Only rabbinic law may be questioned, because the Torah is&nbsp;"God-based."  OK, Prager.&nbsp;The holidays will be here soon. If the Torah is God's law, and you're serious about following it, do what the Torah says you should do to celebrate. Take an unblemished ox or whatever to a kohen and have it sacrificed on&nbsp;an altar.&nbsp;But we don't have a temple. Nu? Neither did the Hebrews to whom the Torah was given. They were wandering around the Sinai peninsula, so presumably the&nbsp;slashing and burning&nbsp;needn't be done in Jerusalem.&nbsp;Local ordinances might not permit doing this in, say, Skokie, but you can always drive out to the country, which seems a minor inconvenience compared to ignoring divine revelation.  I doubt Prager will do this. I assume he will instead drive to synagogue (he doesn't believe the Torah prohibits that; not surprising, since the Torah doesn't contemplate synagogues, let alone motorized vehicles).   Prager, of course, is not calling for animal sacrifice, although presumably he&nbsp;would if he really believed in the Torah&nbsp;as&nbsp;the literal word of God.&nbsp;What he wants is continued second-class status for gays within Judaism, because that is what is called for in "3,000 years of Jewish teaching." The rules of kashruth he dismisses haven't stood the test of time, apparently, dating only to the sixth century. So he disdains Conservative rabbis who "believe that preserving an extra day of yom tov is more urgent that preserving marriage as a man-woman institution."  No wonder Prager is uncomfortable in any of Judaism's major branches - he is liberal on angels-on-the-head-of-a-pin questions such as whether chicken is meat ("though chickens can no more produce milk than fish can"), but reactionary on the rights of actual people. As I said, it makes sense at a moment's glance, but o
