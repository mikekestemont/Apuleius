its been a long day and even this morning i knew it would be...  just not myself today i guess...  i feel so out of place sometimes....  i know why... there just isnt much i can do about it right now... i need some control in my life...  i need that calming influence to help me through my day...it will come eventually... this is yet another exercise in patience...which i've never been particularly good at.  ever feel like you just cant do anything right?  must just be all the stress... too many things on my mind...   food for thought;  " Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ" Gal 6:2  you know... i've never owned a bible... i use to look at it as such a big step, really saying something... but i've accepted Christ in my life... buying a book he meant for everyone to rejoice in isnt a step, its something i should have done a long time ago, though i sort of like sitting in a church, or a library, or even chapters and absorbing the Word... i do find myself at certain points... like now when i wish i had its pages to find comfort in... it is indeed the most reassuring embrace i've ever known... to be enfolded within its pages and enthrawled in its glory...

Its SO comfy, pillow top, plus my feather bed on top, it will be like sleeping on a cloud...  I cant wait to make my bed for the first time, me in a feather sandwich... feather bed on the bottom, me, then a fluffy feather duvet and pillows... mmmmmm   things are coming together with the apartment, i'm less nervous than i thought i would be.   i miss my family, i wish i were closer... i wish i could transplant them here...then again, if they were here.. i probably wouldnt be moving out on my own... meh...
i dont have to work today...  I'm actually considering getting one of those hairless egyptian cats, though i have to say.. i'm still a dog person and i found myself perusing the boston terrier and pug breeder sites this morning...  i think the move to my n
