urlLink     Pat is 18 here (20 now). He is working his fist job making burritos at Free Bird World Burritos in Austin Texas. The food service bug bit him and he's now managing a kitchen at a different restaurant in Austin called "Pato's".  He's a great leader and a very good cook.
urlLink     I have always loved this shot. It's another low rez scan.  The boys, let's see....Ryan was 5 and Pat 4 in this pic. I don't know how old the duck walking by is but I think he said "Aflak!".
urlLink     Pat's # 82. This is a picture of him in his football gear at age 10. We were living in Goose Creek South Carolina here.   urlLink

And Pat...   urlLink

This set is my dream kit form about 20 years ago.  DW is a relatively small corporation located in Oxnard California USA, very close to Los Angeles. They have been making drums for over 20 years. One drum at a time. The hands on building process has created some of the finest drums made with an emphasis on the "modern drum sound".
