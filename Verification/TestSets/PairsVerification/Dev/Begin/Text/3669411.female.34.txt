Why is humanity so willing to allow our egos to drive us to be so unkind and vicious to one another?  How man can look in the mirror and feel entitled and justified to be brutal, I will never, ever understand.  We have collectively lost our sense of community and forsaken it for our need to be right, our need for more, our need to feel superior and strong...for what, I ask you each? So that children can see their fathers bleed on cable access television, so that our fuel prices will go down and lusts for revenge will be satisfied, so that stomachs and hearts will be pitted and gutted by pain?  To feel good while your hand strikes down another in bloody murder is something beyond my senses.  For god's sake, we are all each other's to keep safe!  I confess, I feel sickened by our world today.  My heart goes out to the families of the slain.  This is not OK.

MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- Russian intelligence services warned Washington several times that Saddam Hussein's regime planned terrorist attacks against the United States, President Vladimir Putin has said.  *NOTE TO SELF:  How long will it take GWB to say "uhhh, yeah, Putin...we got the intelligence from Putin...we told you so!" DESPITE the fact that there has not been ONE SINGLE MENTION of this to date, not to the public, not in hearings, zip.  Boy-oh-boy.   urlLink CNN.com - Russia 'warned U.S. about Saddam' - Jun 18, 2004
So, I'm over at Gary & LPs house last night and, not unusually, the subject of politics, policies and Republicans came up.  For those of you who aren't yet in the know, I truly, to the marrow of my bones, hate George W. Bush, his administration and his joke of a presidency.  I also think most Republicans have their heads straight up their ass.  If this offends you, cope, I said most.  Both Gary and LP made excellent points.  Gary's point:  Welfare mothers are damned if they do and damned if they don't.  Think about it, the anti-abortion circuit criminalizes single, pregnant women who choose to terminate a pregnancy, rather than give birth to the baby.  It's murder, right?  Well then these farktards turn around and criminalize single mothers for needing public assistance because the moms so dared to have the child.  What's worse, they do everything in their power to un-empower her by trying to crush the modicum of benefits she may still have left.  Unreal.   Now before you pile on the crap, I'm not talking about these crazy women who bilk the system by pumping out kids at breakneck paces to support crack habits, I'm talking about regular women (I know a few), who got pregnant and need legitimate help to stay above water.  And the first person to suggest she gives up the baby for adoption gets beat on the head with a pig bladder.  Of course, a woman has a right to give u
