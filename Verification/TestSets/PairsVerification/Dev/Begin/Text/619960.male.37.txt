am off to toronto on friday for a week's teaching with my good friend pete ward at the anglican theological college. looking forward to sharing some stories, nuggets and worship tricks across the water. will also be catching up with some friends who first introduced me to the delights of belgian trappist beer - feels good to know that the finest beer in the world comes out of our tradition eh?!
moving right along   Beer drinking Christians, dogs walking around, sitting around, tongues hanging out of windows eating bugs. What is all this? What are we seeing? It's not all tidy and neet and quantifyable is it. I don't even totally know what I'm saying. This is our life - going around trying to see what we can see, as clearly as possible - to hear rightly - and still not totally knowing. That's fine though.    We're finding out that we're "in process" and don't have to "be there" yet. We're being on a journey and we're finding partners to travel with. We're starting not to say  "come on in the church, this is the end of the line, we're all perfect here, and if you're not we don't really want to fool with you too much."  We are learning that a thought process like that is total crap and we're casting the crap aside. Didn't the Catholics figure out long ago that you can have a beer and be a follower of Jesus at the same time? Do they even think twice about it? Or is it just American evangelical Christians who have gotten hung up like that?    Am I rambling? Yes. The newest wave of emerging church leaders, apostolic planters, etc. are breaking those old molds. They don't (we don't) even recognize the molds any more.  "Oh, we were supposed to be poured into some freakin' mold and be like you guys - I'm sorry."  We're sorry, but we won't be poured. We won't be molded - not by that. We will get those molds, those shells out of the way so God can get His hands on us and make us into something that possibly even the "church" won't be able to fully recognize. Let's become unrecognizable - Jesus did.
the dog story:   a dog is walking down the road.  as he walks, he notices that as he moves his feet the trees move.  "feet move, trees move; feet move, trees move" he thought to himself - he is happy, life is good.  then, after his walk, he sits down and starts to wonder over the events that just happened.  but, as he sits he notices that when his butt is down the trees stop moving. "butt down, trees not move; butt down, trees not move," he thought to himself - he is happy.  he thought to himself, "my world is complete - legs move, trees move; butt down, trees don't move."  all life came to an understanding and he was happy, and the world had meaning - all he has is defined by his walk, tree, sit, tree l
