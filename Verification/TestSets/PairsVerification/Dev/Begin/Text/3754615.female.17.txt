Well I just had a lil taste of summer, but now I got let it sink in that I'm gone to summer school. Some times I think it wont be that bad... But then again it could royal suck. I'm going camping this Thursday too, so I'm gonna have to come back on Friday cuz summer school starts then.. How retarded is that!? You know what else is retarded? School, more then half the stuff we learn is never gone do us any good... So why take the effort in strangling to pay attention in class so we can know what to do for the agonizing hours of homework? To me.. It just makes no sence at all. O well, im almost done, next year is gr 12.. But im kinda scared.. I kinda know what I wanna do.. But I just don't know how to get there. Like colledge is fore sure I think... It would be so much easier if I could jus be a rock star lol... Oh that would be the life!  Yeah Kelsey and I are gonna start a band with some guys and were gonna be so awesome, and oh don't u worry, backstage passes will be promised to those who are loved lol... I rely do think its possible. You watch lol
Holly man! I'm so angry! The main reason why I bought warped tour tickets was to see Billy talent and sugarcult and there not coming to Calgary! How messed up is that! So the only thing left to do is go to warped in Toronto... But I gotta get the money for that, and convince matt to come. I know this can so work! lol I have family there so its all good. How hard can it be to save up 500 dollars by august 14? Not hard? I hope not lol. It sux though I sorta have to take a vacation from work because I'm going camping YAY!! But that means 5 days of not working. Man I used to work almost every day with my old job, now sport checks got me working the shittiest hours, it rely bites, but o well, that's life, ill figure something out.. Always do lol C YA!
Alright, so this is my first ...Post? Is that what this is called? lol anyways... So how many times have you herd some one say, "she's such a poser" "she doesn't even play guitar" "she thinks she's punk".. Yeah let me say this "bullshit" and yes, I'm talking about avril lavigne. And I would also like to say, what the hell are you people talking about? Your not up there singing to thousands of people, doing what she loves the most in life as her career! You don't know what its like to be in her shoes, she's who she is! And same goes to all the other so called "poser" artists out there. They worked hard to be where they are now and the last thing we should do is cut them down for making their dreams c
