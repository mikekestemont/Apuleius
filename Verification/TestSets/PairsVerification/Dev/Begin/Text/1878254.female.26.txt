back from europe as of yesterday. had a great time in stockholm and am considering moving there for the summer. wondering how feasible this is ...
finished a nice 5 day trip in Paris. saw lots of old pretty buildings and ate french food. it is really a beautiful city and i found the people to be really friendly, even though my french sucks.  it was also great seeing my friends.  currently in stockholm visiting a friend. i have been here before and already did the tourist stuff so now i can just hang out. great weather too. currently at an internet cafe at h√∂torget tubestop.
had an amazing meal somewhere, i think around the bastille.  an enormous dish of shellfish and a lot of white wine.  really fantastic - and we were all treated by a good friend of carine's.   i wish i could remember the name of that place ... i'll have to ask.
Check out of the Hotel de l'Academie and have a brunch and stroll in Le Marais area. Then C leaves for the airport and I move to my new hotel, the "Hotel le Plan d'Etait", which is near Republique. Not nearly as charming as the last place and I'm still making up my mind about this neighborhood/location, but I suppose a walk around will give a better idea. anyway, i'm still downtown and the room is clean.
Day 2 in Paris. Coffee in the morning on Blvd St. Germain and then we take the metro to Les Halles to have lunch with Carine. We go to a Moroccan restaurant and have a really nice meal. Then C and I go to the Musee d' Orsay and spend a few hours walking around the galleries. She knows quite a bit about art. I don't, but it was really interesting anyway.  Dinner tonight involved looking for an african restaurant called "Omar" near the Republique. Unfortunately the internet connection went down before we could get an address. So we walk forever around the Republique, asking taxi drivers, concierges, etc. One concierge does not know of "Omar" but mentions another african place called "Dogon" just around the corner. we have a look from the corner and decide it is uninspiring. keep walking and looking for "Omar". Finally give up and ask for other restaurant rec's. Almost go to the first place, "Chez Jenny", but it is a bit expensive so we decide to give "Dogon" another shot. We walk up to the restaurant entrance of Dogon and see one guy sitting at the otherwise empty bar. We decide it is closed and walk away. He sees C's union jack umbrella and comes to the door, saying "It's really good! The food here is great! Are you from London? " We walk cautiously back and find out that it's not closed, but the restaurant is upstairs. we walk cautiously upstairs and then are relieved to see a dining area full of people. The man from the bar, Alpha, and his friend, an English teacher in Paris, join us for dinner. He is senegalese, e
