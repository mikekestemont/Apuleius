So why am I doing this?  My close friend, Charlote, who dates back to my days as a student at U of Rochester, is a fine writer and expressed regret at the fact that she hadn't asked me to keep a blog about my experiences as an expectant father.  Charlotte, on her trip to Mysore, India, kept a blog called "Mysore Express," which was quite fascinating. Obviously, this will be a bit different, nonetheless, the play-by-play of life may prove to be interesting/educational/uplifting reading.  First, it's interesting to note that I did not remember the name of Chalotte's blog, "Mysore Express" until I looked it up for writing the last paragraph, yet I titled my blog "Riding on The Daddy Express" for lack of a better title and to get through the registration process on the site ASAP. I guess there are no true original idease, and the subconscious stores all the little facts that we believe to be forgotten for later use.  ------  Today is Friday, July 30th. Sang A's due date is August 8th. This week when we had our weekly appointment with Dr. Stromer, Sang was disappointed to learn that there was still no 'action' inside her. That translated means that the cervix, or bottom of the uterus has not started to widen, which would indicate labor is imminent.  I can't tell you how many times I heard people talk about the cervix dialating, but didn't know exactly what it was until Carmen Flores, a delivery room nurse from Lenox Hill hospital came to our home to give us a private, 3 hour class. During this period, we learned when to call the doctor, what the stages of labor are and what to expect, along with diagrams, time charts and discussion of what happens if you need a C-section, and topped off with a video of different women going through labor and giving birth. It's also important to note that sex can help bring on labor because of a protein in the semen that initiates contractions.  It was an epiphony to only be learning about the details of birth within weeks of needing it. It struck me that in our culture, the details of both birth and death are kept from us until we are thrust into either extreme.  At first when Sang A became pregant and her belly started to bulge a little, I was overcome with the feeling of taking part in a miracle. How could a new life that we created be growing inside of Sang's stomach? I felt humbled, like a pawn in nature's greater scheme and the words to Stevie Wonder's "Isn't She Lovely" keep going through my mind:  "Isn't it great what God has done? Through us He's given life to one"  I have to exit the expressway for now, but will return with more since now I'm warmed up, I can get all of the saved up thoughts off of my mind.
