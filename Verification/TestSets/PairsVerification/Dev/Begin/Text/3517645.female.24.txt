These last two nights at work have been crazy busy for me and Keenan. We are trying to keep up with one of our students who keeps emails us like 10 or more times a night with questions on SQL Server. The only good thing about it is that it keeps up busy and time goes by really quick. I can't wait to go on vacation. I really feel like I need to get away. Maybe my stress level will go down.  Well I booked our hotels tonight for Ontario. We are going to stay one night in Niagara Falls and two nights in Mississauaga. I got some good deals on expedia. I was looking a couple weeks ago at one hotel that was really nice and was on sale for $80 a night, but I book to late and the sale is over, so I had to go with a different hotel. It is still nice. After Madison's appointment we are going to go to my cousin Patti's house in Aurora to stay there for two nights and go to Wonderland with her family, then we are off to Peterborough of a night to see some friends from high school. I am looking forward to going there, but I'm not too. Just because of everything that happened there when Duane lived their and went to school. I will save that story for another post.   I am going to go for a run in the morning. I was looking in the mirror the other day when I was wearing shorts and god my legs are getting awful looking. I need to lose some weight really bad, but it is so hard. I lose 10 put 10 back on and it just keeps going.
Well my weekend didn't go to bad. I went up the camp Friday night and stay until Sunday morning. I arrive back in Fredericton around 2 and duane's parents still hadn't arrived. I did some weeding in the garden and got ready to go out with them. The camp was great. We went to the beach. The kids love playing in the sand and building stuff well I laid out an got a tan. Harley was really good when we were down the beach unlike last time when he kept trying to sneak off over to the other camp to see the dog that was there. Harley loves the water. We through sticks for him and sometimes he just wades around. Everyone was up there and the kids had a great time going to visit everyone.   On Sunday night we went swimming at the hotel and then had supper with duane's parents. It was ok, but I could have been doing other things around the house, like cleaning up.   I went to the dentist on Monday, she said I had beautiful teeth and then hung out with duane's parents at the mall. The bought the kids some new sandals and sneakers. Which saved me some money.
Well I over reacted in my post yesterday. When I got home Duane h
