I hate it when your relationship with someone like totally changes, especially when you were such good friends with that person.  it totally sucks.  i hate losing friends.  god, y do people have to change??? arg.  I just talked to the person and it was like we had nothing to talk about, and they annoy me now, and im sure i annoy them, and its like a little while ago we were such good friends.  its really sad.  I love her, but now its like i love who she used to be, and it's hard to be friends with who she is now.  *sigh* oh well... c'est la vie, right? and now im sitting at home bored as hell with nothing to do on a perfectly good saturday night.  blah.  sucks suck sucks.  and even if i had something to do I'd have no one to take me.
