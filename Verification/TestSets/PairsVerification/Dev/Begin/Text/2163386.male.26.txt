By the way, the name of this Blog, "Solid Mud Wannabe," um, ya.  I'm not sure how long it is going to take for me to get  Solid Mud  published.  So, I'll go ahead and put in a little exerpt to hold you over and give you an idea of what will be coming soon.  Enjoy:    AUTUMN IN ALASKA     Super Turtle, Eddie, Double O, and I drove to the edge of Anchorage where the sun rotated around the sky and shone behind us.  The sun lit the Chugach Mountains in a perfect, cloudless way.  Being late October, most of the leaves had fallen out of their trees by then.  Snow was clinging to ground further and further down the mountainside each day the autumn progressed towards winter.  The dead oranges were amazing. The fresh white of the descending termination dust was telltale of coming winter.   Further down the Seward Highway, looking out the window of the back seat, I could see that Cook Inlet’s tide was coming in at full force.     “Just checking up on you,” I said quietly to the tide.   We took a break from the road at Beluga Point, that miniature headland, that enormously meaningful set of rocks that had endeared themselves so much in so many ways to my three friends and myself.  The four of us climbed the rock formations up above the mud flats below.   A sign read: Dangerous water and mud flats.   Naturally, we got down as close to the rushing water as we could!  I'll never get over the way the white water tide roller-coasters its way up and down as if gravity falls asleep once in awhile.  It’s almost as if the inlet, that hidden part of the Pacific Ocean, chooses to behave like the Colorado River while Mommy’s back is turned.  Just amazing!   We had fun with the pockets of mud that had been trapped on the rocks above the water line after the last tide had gone down.  At first touch, the surface was solid, dry and clumpy, but when shaken up, it turned into slimy and gritty custard.  (The kind you would never serve your children on New Years Eve.)  We stood firmly on top and initiated earthquakes with shaking feet.  Our feet were then firmly embraced in a distinctively sticky surface tension which covered the soupy-flavored mud underneath.  When I tried to lift my feet free from the ‘solid mud grip’, I felt dislocation knocking at the joints of my knees.  A moment later: POP! my shoes came out clean…leaving behind only tread formations.   That littoral mud is comprised of salt water, dead animals, and volcanic ash.  Salt water doesn't freeze at the same temperature as fresh water does and it was below freezing for the rest of the world.  Our hands quickly became numb playing with the hard slime, but we simply couldn’t resist the solid mud.   We moved on down the road bound for Girdwood but didn’t get far.  We stopped 200 feet down the highway, got out of the car again, and walked up t
