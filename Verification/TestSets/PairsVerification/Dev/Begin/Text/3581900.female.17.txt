... I was awakened by an awful stench. To my greatest horror, the giant branch that fell on me, was actually the cow itself. And the incredibly terrifying stench was its crap, on my face. This is turning out to be the worst day of my life, I should run home and clean up now but...
and then it happened a giant branch came down on me.  I was knocked out.  I then dreamed of a beautiful world where everyone was biped versions of animals.  It was totally amazing there were many people there some wonderous with wings while others were dragons.  In this great dream world there were other dream worlds and each one was just as unique as the last i couldn't believe the site.  This world was totally amazing and i wish i could never leave....................
I nearly crapped my pants when all that happened. Not only was I beaten to within an inch of my life, but she threatened to castrate me too. I ran for my life, and my genitals.  I tried to run as fast as I could, as far as I could. But apparently I couldn't, seeing as how I ran into the tree, very fast, although not very far.  It happened to be that same tree that had the cow in it . . .

"Ever mention those cows again and I'll castrate you!" She shrieked.   Geez, what does she have against cows?

It swung around and curved, apparently searching for an open space to land, but it didn't find one, so instead, it exploded.  ::><> <> ::><> <> ::><> <>  It went up into a thousand pieces. The strangest part of it though, was that about 200 or so little calves scattered into the sky from the explosion. How they could possibly land safely with 4 little hooves is beyond me, but one slammed into a tree right next to me. I stared at it for a while . . . .
at the request of the moderator i am startng a story with a different aproach maybe ppl will actaully add to this one!!       I have always loved walking around at night.  It has become a rather interesting hobby of mine cause as i walk i see the most weird people.  Where else do you see a man in a cow costum being pulled on a leash by a lady dressed as a milker.  Anyway on one of my usual nighty walks soemthing happened........................
(Yeah, whomever is the 100th visitor, please send me an email. Dunno what I'll do for you yet, but it'll be nice, eh?)  "Fodder, dear?" My wife asked, pointing to far corner of the room.  Unable to stop myself, I ran over on my little stubby cow legs, and started chewing.  "You'll start to enjoy being a c
