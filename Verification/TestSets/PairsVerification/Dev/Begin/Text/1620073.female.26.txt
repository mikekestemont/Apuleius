Well here is my second post.  Will resolve not to start next post with the word "well".  But we'll see how that goes.  Went on a walk in the Dandenongs (the big mountains that contribute to the fact that it's always cold in Melbourne).  Discussed many phenomenon of being cold.  Like when you're using the mouse on the computer too much and your mouse hand gets all cold.  This results in the technical medical term "mouse hand" - when one hand is colder than the other.  It may also occur in the snow when you've been to the loo and you can only bear subjecting one hand to the cold water.  Invention for the day:  Heated computer mouses.  (Possibly with heated mouse pads).  Thanks to Paul for this.
Well here it is.  Lovely Melbourne weather today.  (I didn't want to start off with comments on the weather, but as I am wrapped in a sleeping bag with my coat on it just couldn't escape me.)  It's cold.  Once when we were kids on a holiday in Lakes Entrance we had swimming lessons.  It was cold then too.  I was a pretty good kid but I refused to get in the water.  When asked why not, I said the water was so cold you could skate on it and told the swimming instructor that she should test it.  How come they always got to wear jumpers over their bathers?  Invention for the day:  Heated floaties for the cold who are learning to swim.  Preferably not solar panelled.
Talked to Mum and Dad before and after Dad's induction about Philosophy and the like.  "And what are you going to do after that, Ainsley?" Shrugs shoulders.  Got home at about 12:30.  Got up with David this morning.  Might be afternoon snooze time or cuppa tea time soon.    Mmmmmmmm, tea.  As if anyone is going to ask for "Earl Grey, cold."  Stupid Star Trek!!!!  I think I am going to a Philosophy Conference in Adelaide for next week.  Scary.  So I might miss a few days blogging.  Mum's  like, you might meet people.  I hate meeting people.  Went to the library at uni and had my house mate borrow a book for me.  It's about Lucretius's morality system and how "death is nothing to us" and all that.  I sound dismissive, but it is only because it is too complex to be bothered typing out on a mere blog.  The author gets right into it (I read one of the chapters for a third year course a few years ago) and it is pretty thick reading.  Invention for the day:  Telepathic typing mechanism that types what you think (thus eliminating the need for air bags on keyboards as you can type while resting your head on a pillow).
Found out David didn't invent the term Ontological Shock.  My faith in his vocabulary is shaken.  Got an email!!!  Turns out he was marking first year exams.  That seems excusable (at least it won't happen during semester, except they'll have essays.  Damn.)  Bed time: 12:30am Up time: 10:40am Left h
