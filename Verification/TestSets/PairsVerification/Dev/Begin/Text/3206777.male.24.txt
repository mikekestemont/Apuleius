This may be esoteric or pointless but I got stuck in a trail of thought one night and ended up with an obvious but personally inspiring conclusion. This is long but writing it help settle a bit of silt in my mind. It is writing for me, not necessarily for anyone passing though. A new purpose for my swampy bogspot!  There is a line of thinking that says that there is such a thing as fate. That is, that there are quite strong elements of pre-determination in life, if not total pre-determination. For example, any decision you make is due to the experiences you have had and the circumstances beyond you. Are you not just doing what all the pre-conditions say you will do? You were always going to have the experiences you had because of the situations that preceded it. Even when you feel like you are making a random choice, the number might just be the number that your brain would choose if it had to. Last night, I did try to think of a random number and suddenly thought "132"... which after a moments thought realised was just a number that was raised earlier that night.   Why am I yapping on about this?   I just read in a book of apparent fiction:  "These people (Australian Aborigines) believe everything exists on this planet for a reason. Everything has a purpose. There are no freaks, misfits, or accidents. There are only misunderstandings and mysteries not yet revealed to mortal man."  I thought this was rather interesting and wanted to think about it but it was late and I was in need of sleep. When I tried to sleep, my mind returned to this discussion.   The section of the book contrasted with something James said to me in an e-mail:  "If everything is predetermined, then it gives me an empty feeling about life and existence.  How meaningful is anything you do, if you were predestined to do it anyway?"  Pre-determination hits upon all sorts of raw nerves. “Judge, I was always going to steal that car, circumstances meant that it was always ever going to be my only reasonable choice with respect to my state of mind, my past experiences, the air temperature and an a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil”  So, it damages faith in real freedom, meaning and other issues, as illuminated above, like justice.   The statement about aboriginal views of everything having a purpose and reason stirred me a little though. And is still stirring me a little. For me, I don't have a belief that everything has a purpose, in a fixed way i.e. this book was NOT always meant to be read by me personally, so that I will have a revelation that will lead me down the track to change the world. Sure, there was a purpose to the book, but it was not specific anyone except perhaps the author but not in a “fate” sense for me. It however can be used for “a” purpose. Recreation, enlightenment, paperweight etc. But “the” purpose i
