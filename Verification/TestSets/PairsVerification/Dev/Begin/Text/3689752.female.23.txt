urlLink Inanna's Witchy Ways.  I know how this woman feels mostly. I hate having people assume that I know nothing because I am young, especially in the subject of the occult. Nothing pisses me off more than some wiccan fluff bunny coming up to me, preaching to me. Well maybe one thing pisses me off more...liars. Liars are scum. When someone lies it says they don't have the balls to tell the truth.
Just so completely not done on purpose, but I noticed something somewhat freaky. I viewed my blog real quick and I was looking at the pretty posts and their colors, and realized that the posts that refer to him are green! Just odd, and freaky.
I had a conversation with him.  It was a very stimulating conversation. We talked about some of the problems that were obvious with the chatters. Not a couple of random off the handle jabs at their person, but more of a carefully studied and calculated approximation of why they were there. Funny enough we both came up with about the same things, just worded differently. We talked about some of our opinions on the world.

His mind and thought process are most appealing to me. Kind of like setting out a dish of the finest cheeses to a conisiour. He rounds it out with a wicked sense of humor. A cutting one if you will. A very intellectual humor, and that is something I cherish. He thinks he isn't funny, but he shouldn't be allowed to judge ourselves. We are our own worse critic. Quite often we look for things to tear down, we force ourselves to find something wrong where there is nothing. His personal morals are quite high. He has his own opinions formed by himself. Not forced upon him from an outside force. They are ironclad. Held firm within his very being. I respect that. He has so much of my respect. I don't know if he will know how much I truly respect him. I have come to some p
