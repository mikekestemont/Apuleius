How do I even start the “Swingers Story”?  I guess the same way as I start everything in my life that surprises anyone – on the Internet.  The match.com Story  Cruising around on match.com, and not being particularly single is really a trip.  If not for pure amusement alone, match.com is worth at least the three-day trial.  There really is no other excuse for signing up other than the desperation of being in a new city (let alone New York City) and not knowing a soul.  Ok, a male soul. One of the ‘features’ of match.com is 50% of off some of the “Match.com Live” events that happen once on occasion around the city. So naturally, being an event planner, I checked these out.  NYC Sex Museum on February 11th.  Why the fuck not?!   I sent the email to my buddy Dan with the header: ‘We are so doing this!’   I think it was partly “I want to do this, so come with me”, and part “this is so weird, we have to do this for the sake of doing it”.  Seeing as though the one reason Dan and I get along is directly related to our eagerness to undertake events such as this – we made reservations and were totally geared up to go to the sex museum. Wednesday rolls around.  Pretty much your typical Wednesday.  I made it over to NYC after a long, involved commute from Long Island to find Dan standing around 13th and University “holding” me a spot.  Even though the spot would have only comfortably accommodated a Ford Focus, he insisted on parallel parking me there.  Two minutes later, tipped off by a very unwelcome scraping sound, I was all-to-aware that my truck had been backed ON TO a compact car behind me.   I guess in New York it is no big deal to significantly damage another vehicle. I waited inside Dan’s apartment for Dan, actually, and even though we had to be at the event at 7:30, he decided to take a shower at 7:10.  Usually this would set me off, but I am trying to be better about this in my attempt to counteract East Coast mentality.  I just played with the dog and it was all good.  7:45 rolls around and we’re in a cab headed toward 5th Avenue toward the Sex Museum.  Dan, amidst his story about his snowboard boots, tells me that the reason we were late/he reeks is because he just smoked up.  Um, so where’s the love?  Well, my friends, the love comes later.  The NYC Sex Museum  We arrive at the sex museum and any of you who think you might have trouble finding it – well, you won’t.  It is a glowing red building.  Quite appropriate, actually, for about what we were to encounter. Imagine your mom and dad.  Now imagine them if they were single.  And then put a bunch of your friends’ moms and dads (the single version) in a room.  Wow.  Oh, yeah, also a
