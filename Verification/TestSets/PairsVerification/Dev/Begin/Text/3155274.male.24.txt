urlLink        Darling, she said, and slipped away.                  He’s been repeating it all morning.             “Darling, she said, and slipped away.”                 He says, and stares at his lukewarm coffee spinning slowly with the microwave plate.    They seem like nice, gentle words and he’d been proud of them all morning, since they came gurgling out in the shower, origin unknown.             Spoken hastily again as he stocked the cigarettes, and again breaking down the cartons and marking the log, and again as he counts change for a customer —              —“excuse me?”     “Sorry, nothing.”       “Did you say something?”     “Nothing.    This heat… make me crazy…”     “Whatever.”              She slipped away.                  They all do.    There’s a second’s contact.    Kind words, a fleeting brush of hands as bills are exchanged, a direct stare, a look away…    Nobody has ever called him “Darling.”    That’s something expensive women said, women from old movies and shows who were so bold and fancy they didn’t know that men were supposed to say it to them.    Women like that came into the store some Saturdays, and tended to smoke Virginia Slims, or 100s, or any stylishly slender cigarette that accentuated their stylishly slender fingers.    They liked mint Lifesavers above all other mints and usually would buy Diet Pepsi instead of Diet Coke, unlike their younger, less fancy counterparts.    He tries to imagine how an entire type of woman all knew to buy the same things.             “Demographics.”    He says, not knowing exactly what it means or why he’d spoken it aloud.    He remembers his coffee, but it’s gone warm again.    Another minute.              Slipped away.                  Almost five already, and already Wednesday, and already July, and only fifty for two more months.    After fifty, nobody cares.    Until you turn sixty, he tells himself, but can’t think of anyone who specifically cares about his being fifty, so he imagines a graceful woman turning slowly and letting her fingers slide from his with the moon reflected off the lake water onto her pale face as she slips away and out of his life.             “This coffee is the most depressing thing I’ve ever tasted in my life,” he explains to a young woman as he takes her bills.    “That’s why I look upset.    I’m not upset.    Just bad coffee.”    She rearranges the bills so all the heads of the presidents face the same way before putting the money in her wallet.    The word “exasperated” whispers across his lips along to the jingle of the door as she slips away.    Outside, the wind whips at her long skirt and he can see the outline of her legs through the fabric.    Hair reels as she turns furiously into the wind and stomps past the front window, headed uptown.               “All that energy’s got to go somewhere,” he tells himself, “I’ll bet she’d make a fantastic lover.”             Nearly five, and time to empty the trash before the rush hour rush.    When he steps outside, the world seems electric and ready to pour.    For a half a moment he stares uptown, bags in each hand, imagination wild, wondering whether to stomp north like the rest o
