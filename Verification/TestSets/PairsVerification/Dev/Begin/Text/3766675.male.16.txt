Well, alrighty. Here it is, like 8:30 at night or whatever, and I'm so bored, and got to thinking about none other than...me! Haha...When I think about it, I go out of my way for people who don't really give a shit about me. Is that cool? I think not. Thought you'd agree. Anyway, I just think about stuff that I go through & not tell anyone, cuz I don't want to burden people. Sure, I talk about problems & stuff with friends, but who wants to be depressed all the time? I guess praying is the only way to go these days. Sometimes I like helping people with their problems, but when that's ALL they ever wanna talk about, I feel stupid. Is that the only reason they're talking to me? Hell yes it is. It's hella annoying. Then you've got your people who never give a shit...and that's even worse. Kind of...they're just complete opposites. So, in realizing that I care too much about other people, I'm thinking...I need time for me. I need to say what I want to say. I'm gonna say what I want to say. I'm gonna do whatever I want, cuz it's about damn time I did. I've got the bestest friends in the world..they know who they are, and they come first. Other than them, I don't care about anyone else :D. How boring am I? Don't answer that...but hey, I never said I was exciting. I mean, I am. Just not right now. And now that I've said it, you can argue. Whatever. :) So...this Friday night is gonna rock, cuz it's me and my peeps again...Carly, Josh & Megan. We had an awesome time last weekend...goin to Movie Gallery for 3 hours..haha..:P..and Carly MAKING me and Josh go wait in the car. :( Oh, did I mention walking down Carly's road is a lot of fun? Except Megan & I got skeered...creepy stuff! It was foggy out..Oh, and there's no telling what's gonna happen this weekend. :| hehehehehe...*evil grin* Peace & All that shit... SiLaS
Have you ever noticed how easy it is to call someone your best friend? It seems like people call total strangers their best friend anymore and that's kind of sad. I've known my best friend since 5th grade, except...we haven't been best friends all along. Really, we haven't been really great friends until about a year ago. So see? Sometimes it takes time to get to know a person. If someone asked me what makes a best friend, I'd have to introduce you to my best friend Carly. :) There's a million qualities you can list, but there's just something about Carly that I can't quite define. Sure, she's like everybody elses best friend & you can tell her anything, she keeps secrets, and she helps you through hard times. But that's not all there is to her. She's not there just through the good or bad, she's there all the time. :) (Like that makes sense, but...you know :P) If you're with Carly, you're guaranteed t
