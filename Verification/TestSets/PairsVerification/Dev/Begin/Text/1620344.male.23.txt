Ok, sorry for the lack of updates recently.  I know that all 2 of you are disappointed(HI DAD!!!). This weekend I'm entered to race in the Northwest Hobie Cat  urlLink Championship Regatta  on  urlLink Lake Quinault .  It should be good times, provided the sailboat doesn’t tip over and I don't get whacked in the head with the boom.  Is anyone else about ready to go postal on Comcast for their dump the dish ad campaign?  I only watch maybe an hour of TV a day and I think every commercial break they have another ad for how getting a satellite ruined Steve's life and now he can't have kids and the use of his left leg is gone and he has no more friends.  DON'T LET IT HAPPEN TO YOU.  GET COMCAST DIGITAL CABLE NOW. BUY BUY BUY BUY.
Ok I think It's about time I put up another post so here it is  Jeff On Recycling ......... Ok I think recycling is a good thing when done right but down here in Oregon they got it all screwed up. First of all you get charged for it and for a while you had to pay for the little bin and then they just decided to give everyone a bigger one and charge everyone more per month. This recycling is not optional so not only do they make money off of the stuff you give them you pay them to make money from you. This is BS but can be expected from a Hippy state but where it goes terribly wrong is they are picky and leave you nasty notes if you leave something in the bin that isn't recylable and leave it there not even bothering to put it in your garbage can or a garbage bin they have. Needless to say if I lived down here in Oregon there is no way in hell I would ever be recycling anything.   Well thats my rant for right now...On a side and more interesting note I almost had take out a 5 ft 6    55 year old man who started yelling and motioning like he was going to throw a punch at my step mom, he  backed off and went away but I was ready to kick some old man butt. That is a prime example of a real estate deal gone terribly terribly wrong. Anyways thats all for now.....We are working on getting a better westsixth working but this will have to do for now. Take it easy everyone.

Ok, the page isn't rendering correctly in IE 6 so you can do 1 of 2 things:  1.  Wait for me to fix the page which might not be for a couple days because I work on HTML for 8 hours a day at work so the thought of messing with it at home doesn't exactly make me giddy.  2.  Download some form of  urlLink Mozilla .  I'm using Firebird right now but any of them will w
