"Everybody needs one" - Fat boy slim, Rollys song before he died "Everybody loves a 303"
"Lilac wine, is sweet 'n heady, where's my love?" - The guy Jeff Buckley covered (My song for Rolly).
Had a dream night before last that my dear cat Roland hadn't died but was just living at a doctors surgery and the bf and I went there and talked the receptionist into giving him back to us. We took him home and introduced him to Kostya (our cat that we got a few months after he died)and they loved each other and all was fantastic. Woke up and realised that he was dead and couldn't stop crying for a few minutes. Fuck I miss him.

Started reading "Women who run with the wolves" last night and it is soothing my soul. In my blokey environment with a history of overpowering male relationships (see current co-worker who feels he is right and an expert about everything) I am really enjoying it. The scope is basically about interpretations of classic fairytales and myths by a jungian analyst and how they relate to womens roles through society and what it is to be a wild woman which is basically being in touch with your intuition, caring, nuturing nature, the world and it's healing powers and standing up for yourself.
