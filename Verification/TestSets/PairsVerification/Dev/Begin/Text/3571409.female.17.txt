Ok so here is my post, again..I am a little new to this Blog thing but I am getting the hang of it....(Thanks Erin) Hey All! I think that I am the first person to respond to this weeks question. To all of you that might not know my, this is Ticia. I am an alumni from '98.' I couldn't make the weekend this year due to some personal matters (i know Matt my coolness factor has decreased) however I plan on being super involved from now on to make next years weekend rock as much and more than this years. I think that there are two possible ways to answer this question. This first thing to realize is do you mean the students that just completed the weekend, or do you mean involving more students to actually participate in next years weekend. If what you mean is to keep the students that just attened the weekend involved, the key is a well run and organized Alumni Program. This I can attest to from experience. I loved the alumni program when I completed my weekend, I used to commute 45 mins just to attend an alumni meeting. The alumni program I feel is the key to keeping the newbies involved. If what you are talking about is getting more students to participate in the actuall weekend I think that comes down to education and to publicitiy. I believe the education aspect of it is another way to keep the recent attendees involved as well. We should think about recruiting them to speak to the sophomores next year about what MASSStar is and maybe why they should want to get involved. Educating the schools even more than I am sure we have about MASSStar as well. I am sorry this is so long and these are just some basic ideas that I am sure can be developed into some great programs, with everybody's input and creativity. I look forward to working closely with all of you.
Hey everyone, sorry I didn't respond to the first one, but here goes:       One way to make MassSTAR more recognizable is to talk about MassSTAR whenever and wherever you can.  We need to let more people know about how amazing this experience is... for everyone, not just us.  I love MassSTAR.  This year's conference was such a new and different experience for me.  I had never been a part of a group that had truly cared so much for one another.  All of the returning staffers made us New Kids feel right at home, from the minute we stepped into our hall.  That was so nice.  A part of making MassSTAR better is to show that warmth and kindness to anyone who is interested in MassSTAR.  Show them just how amazing you guys truly are.  If they see how great this is, they are definitely going to want to join in the fun!  Thanks guys! You all made waves and waves of difference in my life.
Ok guys -- here's the next question!   Look for a new o
