I started a really good book a few days ago. Its called 'Angels & Demons' by Dan Brown. Its reeeeeally cool. Go check it out sometimes. Its one of those matrixy type books. I like it, anyway.   I'm also in the process of writing this sweet song. I mean...its really cool! Well...I like it. The lyrics are real deep and meaningful to me. And the melody just totaly follows the songs meaning.   Ok, the ideas for the novel are rocking. Right now i'm just kind'a brainstorming for it and getting prepaired. I'm making it a goal to start outline by august 1st. I'm going to have the main character's profile completed by the end of this week. That will be a giant step towards outlining.  I really have to run...
I went camping with my youth group this weekend!!! Thats why I haven't posted anything in a few days. And, yeah, it was a blast! Noah and I drew abbs on our stomachs with a red sharpie...went swimming in the creek a million times...sprayed glowing liquid stuff on each other...played kickball...played football...went paddle boating...played more kickball...sang...went crazy...and Noah, Daniel E, and I creamed the majority of Youth Group in ultimate frizbee. THere's nothing else i can really think of...but you get the picture. I just got back yesterday at like five O'clock. I"m real tired right now because I just got home from band practice.   I have to run...I'll definately do more tomorrow...more on the story thingy anyway...

It was such a thrill to see her enjoying herself. Continue to keep her in your prayers. She is sooooooo cool.   Okay, I know I'm a day late, but i was really busy yesterday. But, anyway, here's some stuff about the missions trip I promised to throw on here....  We arrived at Davis & Elkins College at about 6:40 and spent the rest of the evening eting pizza, singing, and playing basketball.   The next day, Daniel (Esig) and I were ordered to dig a a path for a drain box in sinking sand. Worse. It was like 200 degrees out...so we went half naked. By the end of the day we covered in mud from a few aggressive negotiations...anyway, we had sunburn allover our backs with spots scattered white spots the size mrables of where the mud used to be. We went around guarding our backs the rest of the week...especially from nick...jk.  Nothing else great happened until Whendsday, except for scraping and painting a small church. That night, us guys, Daniel (Essig), Noah, Nick, Isaac, and I stripped down to our boxers and held a few gladiator wars with pillows. It was so fun, Then Isaacs like if anybody goes running down the hall past th girls dorm i'll do it too, and so were all like 'yeah, we'll do it' and so we ran out our door and up and down the hall.
