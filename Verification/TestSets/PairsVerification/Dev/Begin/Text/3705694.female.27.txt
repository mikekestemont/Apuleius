So I'm still crazy busy trying to get everything at work ready for my vacation next week, but I decided instead to write a blog entry. If you would call me a procrastinator, you would be right.   At times I've felt that my procrastination has helped me, especially when it comes to work-related things.  I guess I just like the adrenaline rush.  Am I going to make it in time?  Especially as Editor of my college newspaper, Monday mornings were crazy.  I never knew from week to week if we'd make our deadline to the printer or not, and we usually cut it pretty close.  I usually missed my noon Anthropology class because I was driving to Batavia to drop off the files for our paper to get printed at the Clermont Sun (this was before the days of FTP-ing, which is what they do now... lucky bastards).  Anyway, because I missed at least 1/3 of my anthropology classes, I ended up getting a C in that course.  I usually tell people that it was the only C I ever got in college, but to confess, I also got a C in Journalism Ethics.  The anthropology C doesn't reflect badly on me, but the Journalism Ethics grade kind of looks bad I think.  In my defense, it wasn't that I wasn't journalistically ethical per se, it was more that I really didn't try too hard in that class. The advisor to the newspaper was the professor, and I thought of it as sort of a "free ride" class.  Unfortunately, the professor didn't see it that way... he was actually going to grade me based on my performance in class.  How rude.    Since I've been out of college (and grad school), I have had a lot of the typical "forgot my homework" dreams.  I also have a recurring dream where I somehow forgot to show up for class all semester, and didn't know what to do.  I also tend to have a lot of dreams about bugs.  They are usually attacking me in some way, and usually involves me trying to squish them.  I think I need some sort of dream analysis, because it's obvious that at a subconscious level, I am seriously disturbed.  I really should get back to work now... hey, it's almost lunchtime.  I'm thinking I'll go to Arby's today.  Everytime I go there it reminds me of the time my brother Nick spilled the Au-jou sauce for his French dip all over his car.  His car smelled like Arby's for two years.  I really should get back to work now... really.  Until next time, Gabrielle
I'm scrambling around attempting to get everything at work all set before I leave for vacation next week.  It's alarming to me that no one seems to realize the implications of my taking a vacation.  Ummm, what are you people going to do?  Anyone?  Bueller?  Taking a week's vacation shouldn't be this difficult.  Really. I luckily have one co-worker who I feel confident will keep things running smoothly while I'm gone, but, sheesh, w
