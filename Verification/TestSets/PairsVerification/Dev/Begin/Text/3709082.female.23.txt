5pm  Went out last night but Sandra called at the last minute and said to meet round her place because she was running late and didn't want me sitting in a pub on my own. I didn't drink anything I wasn't in the mood. We chatted for a while and then I came home.   I couldn't get to sleep until aroun 6am but I woke up at 7am and threw up quite a bit, it was really hot so I turned the heating off and opened up a window in my room, then went to back to sleep. I feel fine now so maybe that was it.  I don't know whether to go out tonight or just have a long soak in the bath and read my book. decisions decisions.   I think I may write children's stories ,lol.
1:40am    So i'm pretty sure that my phones broken, i threw it across my room last night hoping that it would land on the couch and it seems my aim was a little off. I called my number this morning so that it would ring and I'd find it only it said the number i was ringing could not be recognized or something. Anyhoo I found my phone and I can still ring out and send and recieve text messages, maybe it'll fix itself or something.  I'm sorta drunk from last night but I can feel myself start to sober up.   I'm supposed to be meeting Sandra in some pub in Mitcham, the something or other arms, apparently i've been there before according to julie but i dont remember. I cant remember what time i said i'll meet her, I'll have to call her later on and find out either way it'll probly be a good hour and a bit before i find the place and she'll have left.lol. I don't know why we aren't meeting at her place, I know how to get to there. I'm sure she does these things on purpose just to confuse me.  i think he's sick of me, he said he'd wouldn't mind ending things if thats what i wanted but i said it wasnt, maybe he was hoping I would say ok and leave him in peace, i dont blame him. i've been a total cow. I didnt tell him i was here i was just gonna text him one morning and say i was here if he wanted to meet up but it seems like a stupid idea now. Maybe I shouldn't think about stuff too much.  i don't feel well.  that lump i found has been aching on and off all day and that can't be good.   I keep thinking its monday when its tuesday and i spent the whole of sunday thinking it was friday, I'm losing my marbles. And theres nothing but shit on the radio.  best program on tv = the hoobs (especially when you haven't slept for a couple of days)   Why do hairy, beer guzzling. 14+ stone bikers like Vanessa Carlton songs?  Oh and a new year begins today. S
