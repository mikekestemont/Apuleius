RUN!!  no, wait... thats what I wanted!  YAY!   She's coming today!  funfunfunfunfunfufnunfunfunfun....  HUZZAH!   I'm happy, and hyper, so its 'sall good.  What in the name of ....um...cheese am I talking about?   OOO!  Something I just want to tell everybody ( espesially wheaton)  I actually WON an argument!  HUZZAH!  It was about Incubi and Succubi, ( yeahyeah I know thats kindof sick) But the guy I was arguing with said that Incubi only "attacked" women, and that Succubi did men.   But I don't see why an Incubi can't do that to men also?  I mean, they're demons for crying out loud!  They don't have RULES about who they can and can't ....  "attack"  oops, this is totally inapropriate, Don't repeat a word I just said,  its very sick.  And if you don't know what an Incubus and a Succubus is then DON'T find out!  Jeez, why am I so morbid?  And why do I dwell on the ...um... pleasures of demons?  nastynastynastynasty....AARRG  I'll shut up now!  So sorry
I love rock operas ... well, Tommy and Rocky at least.  Could you call Rocky Horror a rock opera? probably.  Tommy is disturbing ( not that Rocky isn't) Tommy is about a deaf, dumb, and blind boy... and is very disturbing.  But Rocky Horror Picture Show is about an alian.  He's a sweet transvestite from transexual translvania... so its quite disturbing too.  Wow, I'm really freaky, I love really freaky things.  I'm also morbid, its so sad... ::sob::
Thank you Nate for helping my blog ^^
ITS CHRISTMAS! WHO- wait a minute....I've been saying "whoot" way to much, I need a new word.  ::thinks::  PANG! no, WHOOP! no, HUZZAH!  ok, that will do for now.  HUZZAH!   I am currently writing a story! YAY for me!  Anouther story that I'll probably NEVER finish and will NEVER show to anyone, I'm so pathetic!  Anyhoo, this one might just turn out to be cool.  I drew a map of a non-existant world and I came up with a bunch of names for the places and stuff.  I started writing around that. adios amigos...
VACATION!  DOUBLE WHOOT!  For my presents I got a book on the making if Gollum, by Andy, and a gollum bookmark with "the ring" attached.  Took ring off and fasened it to necklace, yes presious.  This is your fault Nora and Laura, all your fault for encuraging me. ( note: I can't spell for shist....so yeah.  Oh, and shist is my new swear...its a type of rock ^^ )  I'm bored, and tired, and I can't draw anymore...that stupid map made my muse tired so he went to sleep.  A muse is a ...greek?Roman?oh well, its a goddess....but I think mine is a guy, so that doesn't really work.  I'm ranting, this is my random rant sight, yehaw!
WHOOT!  check it out! I HAVE A BLOG!  Well....actually I already had one...but all you peoples convinced me to get one HERE instead of at XANGA, so here I is!  This place my be a place for random rants ( YAY ) actually, it probably will be so....whatever.    Ruby: So o
