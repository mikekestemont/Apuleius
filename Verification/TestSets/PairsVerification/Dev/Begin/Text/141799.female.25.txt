I'm blogging from my cousin's house in JB right now. Big ass screen.. cool. Anyways, the trip has so far been filled with visiting and spending time with relatives. I'm missing KL, though. But, at the same time I'm chilling out and appreciating the quality time with everyone. Besides, I had  a few sms msgs and a couple of phone calls  that put a smile on my face *Hehe* * wink wink*  I've been using up the credit on my brother's cell sending msgs to people *Hehe* I promised him I'll pay for them, that refrained him from killing me. Fahmy called around 11pm and told me he's meeting up with Shakhira at BarFlam for drinks. I texted Shakhira when I got back from my uncle's place and she said she's  "borrowing"  Fahmy. Crazy girl. *sniff sniff*  I wanna be there!!!    Counting the hours until Monday... When I'll be back in KL and celebrating New Year's with everyone. Crap! I still haven't gotten an outfit for that night. Well, gonna sign off now.   G'nite.
Whoa.. last night was freaky. Not weird-freaky.. but major-fun-freaky. Went to dinner with Diana, Ninie and Shakhira at Modesto's. Ninie's having her birthday thang at  urlLink BarFlam  tonight, so we went over so she could finalise her reservations and stuff.   Original plan:  A drink or two while Ninie talk to the guy there.  Finally:  Stayed until midnight, left the place and somehow ended up back there. Diana went home, but we stayed until after 3am. *shakes head* Shakhira had mas0r fun, me and Ninie danced to practically all the songs. We were dressed majorly casual, while the most of the crowd (the girls, anyway) were decked in clubbing attire.  urlLink BarFlam  was surprisingly crowded and kicking, for a Thursday night. A couple of guys from the place came over after work and we hung out 'til morning. I had to leave around 10.45am to pick my sister up and head home.   That brings me to the not so good piece of news. I'm leaving for JB later. That means, I had to leave Shakhira's place when I didn't want to and also I'll be missing Ninie's birthday do.  BOOOO!  I'm really dissapointed. Oh well, atleast I had some last minute fun last night and this morning. The bright side is, I'll be back Monday (the 31st) in time to celebrate the new year with the girls. No definite plans for the night, but all I know is I wanna have one hell of a time.  Well, gotta get some stuff done before the trip. I'm gonna go now, maybe I'll be able to blog from JB.. I don't know. See you next year!
Take the  urlLink "What kind of Squirrel am I Test!"
This is freakin spooky. Annoying too. Somehow my password to my  urlLink blog  was changed. I don't remember changing it, let alone to only a single letter. Weird. Was I tripping like mad when I was writting the last entry and changed the darn thing?  I highly doubt it.  Oh well... Whatever.  It was just confirmed t
