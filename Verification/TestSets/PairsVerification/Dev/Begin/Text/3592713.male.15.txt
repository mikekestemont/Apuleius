This post is a quick deviation from the main purpose of this blog, but here geos. I've started another blog called "Movie Drivel", whose purpose is to convey movie reviews posted by anybody who wants to post, on movies that they've watched. Now these can be Movie reviews, discussions, analysis', whatever. The movies that are reviewed are also rated out of a possible five gold bars (yes, you heard it here first, we are using gold bars to rate movies), and include plot overviews and actual content (review, discussion, etc).   So Check out  urlLink Movie Drivel  Note: there are currently three people including myself who post movie reviews, and we are looking for more people (anybody who wants to post). So email me if you are interested:  urlLink kayvzb@gmail.com
Anyone who has their license can remember the tedious process of actually acquiring it. First you'd have to go through countless hours of Drivers Education, followed by Drivers training, and then whole year of having a Learners Permit, until finally you can get your Provisional license (which still doesn't give you complete freedom for another whole year). As a teenager currently going through the process, I've noticed a few things and realized that  the process of licensing teenagers is a method of control instituted by the government to control young drivers, and to allow private buisiness' to profit.   Until about a decade ago, Driver education services were run by the government. There were a few problems that the government noticed with this method of instructing future drivers. Firstly, as time progressed, more and more drivers would be on the roads, which in turn increases the amount of unsafe driving, thus raising the accident level. Since these classes were issued by the government, they had to be free to the public so that any teenager enrolled in a public/private school could attend them. In turn, the government ceased public drivers education/training classes of their own, and issued licenses to private buisiness' that would allow students to enroll for a price. This in turn decreases the amount of teenagers that could get their licenses, because of course not all families can afford to pay the hefty bill that the process of getting a license incurs. As you can imagine, the eagerness of teenagers to drive allows these private buisiness to rack up quite a lot of money, and in turn, the government has more control over the legality of teenage drivers.   On top of all of this, insurance Policies serve as a stronger method of control. Many families don't bother paying for their children's drivers education services because Insurance prices for teenagers with vehicles continue to skyrocket. It's no wonder insurance Policies for teenagers are so high anyway. It allows the teenage driving pool to be much smaller, and makes teenagers that ARE licensed to be relatively good drivers (because of the expensive driving lessons). And also, when parents can afford to send their kids to drivers education, and do so, the result is often that the teenager goes through with the process and a
