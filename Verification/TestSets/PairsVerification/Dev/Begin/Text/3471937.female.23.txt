So, it is Sunday night about 1 in the morning here in Indy.  It is Memorial Day weekend, so no work until Tuesday, which is fabulous! YAY!  I've really accomplished my goal this weekend of having a positive attitude and not being so sensitive.  Today, especially, was really nice.  I actually spent the night at my apartment, which may have been the first time all week.  And I spent the day cleaning and organizing.  It is not completely finished, but I can see light at the end of the tunnel for sure, and it is a very nice feeling.  We also bought some paint for the walls in the dining area, which will be a lot of fun.  I'm really happy for Dana.  She has met a new guy, Dan (go figure that would be his name, right?) But anyways...he is really great.  I like him a lot.  He is her age, 19, which is easy to forget sometimes because he seems so mature.  If something more comes of it, I think he will be really good for Dana.  He is really responsible.  He has a great job working as a mechanic for BMW and he owns his own house and at least 2 vehicles, completely financially stable at 19 which is beyond amazing.  But the more important thing than all of that is that he seems to be a real sweetheart.  He is treating Dana really well so far, which she totally deserves and needs.  She really seems to like him so much too, which makes me so happy.  I hope that she can see that this is the type of guy she can be with.  Somebody whose life is actually going somewhere and who treats her well.  I know that it will still be difficult for her to move on with her life and completely cut off things with Daniel (the ex, not Dan the new guy), but hopefully she will be able to see how much better she can do.  I foresee good things (or I really hope anyway).  So that's that.  And...well, I got an email from Uli.  Crazy.  I just had to laugh right out loud.  So, she and Ovi have been spending a lot of time together.  I had a feeling that he may be interested in her, but lo and behold, she seems to be interested too.  She said that he gave her a big hug and was holding her hand this week and her heart was racing.  Wow!  I mean what can I say.  I've always thought that Ovi was a great guy, even if we didn't completely hit it off due to the situation with Paul.  So I think it is really fantastic for Uli.  But I have to laugh I really do.  I mean Ovi is Paul's best friend.  So...Paul cut off things with Uli because he wanted things to beyond friendship without an actual commitment.  And she wasn't willing to have a relationship with him beyond friendship because of me and my history with Paul, which she told Paul, a
