I've been thinking a lot over the course of the past 24 hours about why it is that so many people are overweight in our country and why so many are stressed out. I've actually come up with some rather novel ideas...meaning that someone may have thought of this already but I haven't seen any writings on it as of yet.  First, let's cut to the chase and talk a bit about obesity. We all know the reasons that people get fat; too much food and too little exercise, right? But why is it that we are eating so much more than we used to and exercising so much less? (There are studies that support these two suppositions, but I'm not into doing all the reference work. So if you don't believe me, Google it.)  I would submit that the major reason that so many American are obese and unfit is because they lead such hectic lives that nothing really satisfies them. They flit from activity to activity like hummingbirds flit from flower to flower, never pausing to rest or slow down until they drop from exhaustion at the end of the day. What the hell kind of life is that? Oh yeah, you get so much done and you are "living life to the fullest"; never missing a minute of time. I submit to you that your are all kidding yourselves and part of the symptoms that you experience are overweight and stress.  Let me explain. When you go through the McDonald's drive through, wolf down a Big Mac, Coke and fries while driving what do you really taste? When you sit down to a meal at home and you have the TV on while you eat, are you really tasting that chicken while watching the evening news? When you grab an ice cream while out walking down the street with friends, do you really taste more than the first few bites before you get wrapped up in conversation and your tastebuds get frozen from eating too fast? (There is another study that was done that supports the idea we only really taste and enjoy the first 10% of any dessert we eat. Interesting, yes?)  I think there is an epidemic of overeating related to the hectic pace at which we live our lives. We never slow down to really savor a smell or a flavor. We don't slow down enough to even truly chew our food properly half the time! Is it any wonder that our food brings us no satisfaction and we eat more and more of it to try to fill in that void? And we haven't even talked about the stress that accompanies all of this!  Okay, I know what you're all going to say to this, "I just don't have enough time!" I'll submit to you that you have more time than you think. You simply choose to spend your time doing things like watching TV, playing computer games, filling your schedule with activities and basically not even thinking about the ramifications of these c
