Yeah, I messed up.  Technically, this is now my first ever blog, and is subesquently senseless to those who don't know about stuff, or shit. Oh well.  OH NOES!!  I've got my posts back. I'll just have to repost them to make things more normal. Yeah, basically, ignore this post.
I've spent an overly large part of the last twenty-four hours editing and making changes to my blog template. Most of them unsuccesful, which is why it looks exactly the same. I couldn't even get comments to work.   The point is, blogspots are addictive. I can imagine alot more time being taken up by this thing. I'm also currently pondering whether to change from .tk already, as the constraints of free domains are already starting to piss me off.  I saw Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban today. It's certainly the best of the three, and I like it even more due to my love of time-travel paradox, but it's still not all that good. Both Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) and Emma Watson (Hermione Grainger) have improved massively as actors since The Philosopher's Stone, which is possibly the most overrated film ever. That ginger-haired guy is still crappy, though.  Positives: Lenny Henry, Dawn French, Gary Oldman, Jim Tavar√© and Robbie Coltrane. Negatives: That ginger-haired guy.
My first blog in six months. Over a year since I started my original blog. Back in my youth, when half-terms and holidays were a time for getting drunk, staying up late and blogging about the most meaningless of things. And angsting because Lee from Blue is better looking than you are. Okay, nothing's actually changed in that time, and I still hate Lee from Blue.  This is a place where I will post things that happen in my life, and some things that don't.  Actually, I've just realised that that last sentence makes no sense. I feel strange tonight, like I'm drunk a bit. But I haven't had any alcohol since last night, and today have drunk eight cans of coke and two mugs of coffee. I'm gonna level with you: I think it was the coke.
"Old enough to bleed, old enough to breed," says a 30 year old friend about a 15 year old friend. He's clearly a paedo.
My disease has now spread to my chest, filling my lungs with flem and causing a chest infection. FUCKING GAY, if you ask me. Which means I haven't been into work again, which means I'll probably get sack0rised. Which is truly fucking gay, and gay is homosexual.  So just when I was getting ready to go back to school, I get something else. Low resistance is gay. If things don't pick up soon, I may even not be in school for monday. Being ill is so depressing.  I'm gonna go to the bathroom and cough. BUY.
After my last blog, it probably looks as though my missing of the last two days of school is truancy, but it actually isn't. This time. I have possibly the worst cold I've ever had, combined with hayfever, and my whole h
