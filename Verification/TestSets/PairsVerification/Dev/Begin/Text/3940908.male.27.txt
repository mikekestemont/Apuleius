I spent the day with my daughter, Macy, the other day and boy did I learn a lesson. I made plans with my wife to take her out for the day while my wife went shopping and enjoyed some leasure time without her two kids, Macy and I. Being a one cell phone family, we have to flip a coin for the privilege to use it. I lost that day, as I do most times. That is why, in my free time, I'm trying to figure out what cell phone company is offering the best deals for a family plan.  I decided to take Macy to the park and have a picnic lunch. Before I could do that, I had to run by the bank for a deposit. Being an all American dad I didn't bother making a picnic lunch, I knew Burger King would offer us some great choices for our picnic. We took our lunch went to Lilburn Park, which is looking fabulous after all the work they've done in the past year. After lunch we went over to the playground and played for and hour or so. We then went to the public library and spent another hour playing the games on the kids computers, looking for books to check-out and finding some kids videos for the 'Macer.' We then went to Walmart to pick up some odds and ends. After we finished up at Walmart we headed by the house to see if Erin wanted to join us for the pool. She wasn't home so instead of calling, like a responsible adult, I just threw the Diet Coke's in the garage and headed to the pool. We spent almost two hours at the pool and then decided around 5:30 that we better head home soon. When we got home I thought I was going to lose my scalp. I hadn't called or left a note or anything and Erin was about to send the search party out to find our dead, rotting bodies. So now when I say I'm taking Macy for the day, I better not take all day.  How could the same events cause such opposite feelings (emotions)? Joy for Macy and I while Erin had despair. Is it not the same for many other events around us? 9/11 caused dread and fear among Americans while it caused a quite different reaction in other parts of the world. The last Presidential election between President Bush and that other guy. The gay marriages that were happening in San Francisco. The music sharing Internet invention of Napster, and then the lawsuits that followed. A savior dying on a tree in Isreal two thousand years ago. Which side are you on?   Matthew 10:32-35   "Whoever acknowledges me before men, I will also acknowledge him before my Father in heaven. But whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven. "Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I
