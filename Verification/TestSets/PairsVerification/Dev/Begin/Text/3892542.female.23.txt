Yeah so...remember when I said that I was going to leave and not come back until I had something exciting to write about? I lied. I did leave and nothing exciting happened, but I'm writing anyway...out of pure fucking boredom. I'm in quite the rancid mood right now. I'm not sure I've ever hated my job as much as I do right now. I know most of you are out there thinking...'well, it's that awful, quit and find another job, stop being such a whiney bitch'...well fuck you, because it's not that easy. Don't get me wrong...I love Cape Breton, I was born here, it's beautiful and all that, BUT WE NEED SOME FUCKING REAL WORK AROUND HERE! I'm so so sick of talking to ignorant fucks who's main goal is to call you from the middle of no where and scream at you for something that is not your fault. America, I'm sure you're great and all, but some of the most ignorant, self-righteous pricks in the world live in your O-SO-FANTASIC country. Step down from your pedistal, take your head from out of your own ass and take a look around. That's all I have to say about that for now.  On a totally unrelated topic, why do record company's keep giving record deals to absolute tards with little to no musical talent??? This horrid...absolute garbage...metal scraping against metal noise that has been passing for 'good music' on our local radio station is the saddest thing since J-Lo's 3rd marriage. Someone has to let me take over the local music stations around here. In fact, I think I'll start a petition.
You know, I'm not sure I realized how boring I actually am, until I started this blog.&nbsp; I just plain don't have anything exciting or even remotely interesting to talk about.&nbsp; How about this, I'll go out and find something exciting to do with my life and then I'll come back and write about it.&nbsp; Okay?&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Until then, I guess I'll end on this note...  &nbsp;    Hello, Mr. Zebra      Can I have your sweater?      Cause it's cold, cold, cold      In my hole, hole, hole.      Ratatouille   Strychnine,      Sometime's she's a friend of mine.      With&nbsp;her gigantic whirlpool      That will blow your mind...        &nbsp;    Hello, Mr. Zebra      Ran into some confusion      With a Mrs. Crocodile     Furry muscles marching on     She thinks she's Kaiser Wilhelm     or a civilized syllabub     to blow your mind...       &nbsp;   Figure it out     She, she's a good time fella.     She's got a little fund to fight for Moneypennies rite's     Figure it out     She, she's a good time fella.     Too bad the burial was premature,     she said and smiled...     ~TA        &nbsp;
I've become a hypochondriac of grand proportions.  I wasn't always this way.  I used to be fun, easy going, healthy...I was just okay.  Now, I barely know how to live without being in constant fear of phobias.  I'm at a point now, where I just don't know what to do anymore.  Please, take a moment to walk in my shoes... I can no longer eat in restaurants, around p
