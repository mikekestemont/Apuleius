Well this afternoon has been odd.  I talked to Ross, that was fun, we decided we would be friends w/ benefits cuz come on, its fun.  I mean its not like something is goin to come of it and its not botherin anyone and it wont hurt anyone so its all good, lol.  Well we had fun discussin that.  Then it was odd, someone told Arik to call me, cuz he called me cell, which I didnt give him my number, *got to find out who did that*  We talked, he felt bad so did I but even though we said sorry, it just doesnt do all the work to fix everything, ya know.  I got AIM back and now I have a real reason to be on cuz Nate, omg great guy, so funnie.  Well, I had an interesting talk w/ Arik, and then w/ Ross.  I think me and Ross know whats goin to happen in the future for people but no one will listen to us, or they say o'no things are different, nah, its the same.  If only they would listen to me and Ross, we could help them spare heart break but who would listen to the two of us, o'well.  I guess like Ross said, in a couple of months we can say, I told you so, lol.  But it just wont feel right ya know cuz it would still suck.  But w/e happens happens, and we cant stop it.  All I know, is that the past is the past and I will NEVER NEVER NEVER repeat it, not for anyone, not even for my own short term happiness.  Things are goin pretty good now, *yay*  I have decided that I will not have any relationship in the near future, just friends w/ benefits cuz if I keep it that way I wont get hurt.  I dont want to fall in love anytime soon, and it suckz.  Cuz all my life thats all I ever wanted and now I'm scared.  Why fall in love?  I'll just get hurt like alwayz, *sigh*  Maybe some day, my prince charmin will arrive and sweep me off my feet, but  eh, he probably will turn out to be a jackass like the rest.  I'm startin to realize, the only guy I can trust really is Ross, yeah it suckz to be you Ross, sorry its true, lol.  You know its odd, cuz I'm happy yet not the happy I want.  I'm happy w/ my life except you know, I'm misin that one key thing, but I'm not ready for it.  Maybe I never will, maybe I never will find that right guy, that one thats suppost to sweep me off my feet and carry me away into the sun set, *sigh*  Maybe what I need to do, is to start to trust again, eh, thats hard one.  I have alwayz been so trustin, now I cant.  Its like everything I was before, I'm not anymore.  I hate it, its like I cant be me anymore, I think the r
