Okay, it's 5:45 PM. At 7:00, Shrek 2 is playing in a theatre near my house. At 6:30, Ross will be picked up in my car, with me and my dad in it. Then, we're gonna go to the theatre, meet a nice girl named Nikki and her friend Amber, and see a movie. YES!!!!!!   So now I'm here, listening to "Smile Lines" by Incubus. This is a damn good CD. I bought it just before going to spring break this year. We went west again in 04. However, in 2003 we went to Flagstaff. In 2004, we stayed in Las Vegas. Which was fun! It really was. It may seem like there's just porn and strip clubs and adult stuff to see there, but there's more for kids than you think. The only part that really ruined it for me was the porn in the streets. If you walk along the sidewalk, you just seen porn, just LYING in the streets, everywhere. More than half the ground is covered by it. It's all passed out by these Mexicans who can't speak a word of Spanish, so you can't tell them to quit handing porn out to these little kids. If you go to Vegas, just watch the kids' eyes. They'll learn more than they should while they're down there.  That's just kind of how the world goes though. We do shit without thinking about. Then when we do think, we decide that some later generation will take care of it. Like global warming. Inflation. War. We just fuck everything up, then let our kids take care of it. It's all Bush's fault....
August 9, 2003. I lied. Yes, I did. So I got what I deserved. Katie dumped me. Ross cussed me out. Jeff told me he was ashamed of being my friend. I call Kelly, the only person I can run to now, and I'm going fucking crazy, saying some crazy shit about running away to Flagstaff, like that'll fix everything. I said something really dumb about I'll find some fucking answer there. Don't ask me what I was talkin about. That was my only suicidal experience, that night. I got my head phones, played a loud song, walked around for four hours in my neighborhood, burned a Bible. I just had no faith in anything. That night, Kelly talked about me lying as well. So because of my stupid actions, I was out. No body. I had to start from scratch. Clear and complete scratch.  That summer just about killed me, if I didn't have something to hold on to. No, it wasn't Flagstaff, but it was close. I learned a lot of things. About lying...about trying to impress people falsely....about saying and doing things without thinking about the consequences.   For three months after the summer, until the middle of January, I wondered aimlessly around, trying to put my life back together. Didn't talk to Katie much, she still insists on ruining my life. Me and Kelly went out for a bit. Jeff and Sarah did. Then...I met N
