25/5/03 Namaste, I must say it is very convenient having a cheap computer in the hotel we are staying at. But sadly like most things in life this must come to an end, today. We have decided today we must move out and go to a Nepalese family to start our Nepali lessons. Right now we have one family that will take us for sure, but are hoping to find a slightly tutor who we can stay with. This morning we will go and talk with her to see if we can afford her.    As to the last couple days... well we had our first mishap yesterday. As it turns out we got in the wrong shuttle from the airport and went to the wrong hotel. We went to the Tibet Guest House, not the Tibet Peace Guest House, Oops. After a couple phone calls and some talking the manger here at where we are staying, after hearing we are students and looking to help the Nepalese people said we could stay here for the same price we would have had at the other hotel of US$10 (and this one is much nicer, about 2 times the price, and has computers) so it worked out in the end. The manger also was very interested in helping us out and offered for us to stay in his house while we were learning Nepali. He also invited us to his house for dinner. Oh it was good food, jackfruit curry with pounded rice, yum yum, with just enough spice for me. We talked for a couple hours about Nepal, tourism, culture, etc. and I guess had our first interview for our research.    We decided after dinner that we would ride a bus back some of the way to our hotel and walk around 1-2 km back to the hotel. Equipped with direction we headed out, we got of the bus fine and started walking, walked, walked, and walked right past our turn, for about 20 min. When we hit temple central in downtown, we realize we missed our turn, and it started raining. We had quite a nice walk in rain it is very different on the streets here then in many places I've been, more respectful I think. We managed to find our way back to the hotel, a little bit wiser and a lot wetter. After a handful more phone calls and showers we settled down for bed, jet lag is a pain. Although Pete and I stayed up chatting in be, kinda reminiscent of youth retreats where you talk all night and your councilor keeps telling you to go to sleep, yeah.    This morning, I got up at a little before 5am (jet-lag), where Pete seems to be doing better then me in this department. I decided to go up to the top of out hotel and watch the sun rise (don't worry folks, I got photos). Pete came up just as it was rising to see too.    Soon we will be off to see our (hopeful) future tutor.   A
