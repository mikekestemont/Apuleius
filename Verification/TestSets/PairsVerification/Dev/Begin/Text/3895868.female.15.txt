Oh my god.. wad a tiring day today! I almost couldn't get up for school this morning. As usual, I got up for school and headed for school. Same old boring stuff happened in school today.[I'm sure many of u would understand how it feels having boring lessons??!] Lessons today were like...Teachers speaking a different kind of language, causing the losing of interests in what they are talking.?. How can I describe it other than that way?! After school, I even had my E maths peer tutoring until 4.20pm, followed by my Structured Self Study programme til 5.30pm.
Geex... Imagine more than half of your day gone just like that. I would rather come straight home after school, take a nap and then head on with my assignments and revision. I'm sooo.... unsatisfied with the plans by our school most of the times. However, all I can say is, 'Unfortunately, nothing can be done by me, myself.' Which school has ever expected their students to pay for the worksheets given by the teachers?! This would be the first for me, in my 16 years of life! ..Haix.. Never mind.
Nevertheless, I hope that everyone else did not go through the same as what I did today. Instead, I hope that u ppl had a great time in school with your pals n all... and not forgetting to have learnt something today! ~cHilL~PeAcE oUt~
Hmmm... Try having a guess at wad I've done on my Sunday. I did nth but do my homework in front of e computer since noon time. How boring. I'm now typing this as I chose to have a break. I was actually suppose to be out with my family at my grandma's since this mornin. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to wake up that 'early'(errmx.. According to my definition of early..hEhee).
Sometimes I feel bored to the extend that I could sleep all day! But I'm afraid of putting on more weight man! Enuff weight with me already manx! Need to lose some. Ok.. Cut this crap. I wonder wad does everyone else do on a Sunday if u were to stay at home n do nth else?~ Any suggestions? However, lucky me, I've got some good pals who r willing to chat with me on e phone! Thanks a lot... U Know who u r~ ok.. I'll stop here for today. Update once I've got e time to!
Another long day it is today. What can i say once again?! Boring? Interesting lessons? Exciting? Geex.. ONCE AGAIN... Boring! Can u imagine havin lessons this boring for one whole year? Well, maybe when you get lucky, you'll have a few interesting ways of learning the topic being taught. If not.. never will get interested manx. However, its still up to oneself to pay attention or not. Okx.. Cut the school stuff.
Hmm.. May I know w
