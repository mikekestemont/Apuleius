TWO WALK OFF HOMERUNS TO WIN.  BUCS REACH .500 this late in the season for first time since High School.  oh yeah, ROB MACKOWIACK.  if you don't know what that means, go to ESPN.com.  his boxscore for today: 1 kid, 2 9th inning HRs (1 walkoff GRANDSLAM, 1 Game-tying HR), 6 RBIs, 8 total bases.  move over Jim Edmonds, I've got a new official favorite ballplayer.  59 forever.
Hey everyone, and by everyone, I mean Uram, the only person who reads this.  Today's been a solid day-- got lots of great feedback on my first paper for my law firm, beat Jeanette's ASS in racquetball, and am getting ready to go meet up with my estranged lil' bro, Rusckel the Love Musckel.  This weekend's going to be beyond awesome, with my first paycheck, a Double Header at PNC tomorrow, a baseball game on Saturday, and my Aunt/landlord's RETIREMENT PROMAPALOOZA on the Gateway Clipper Sunday! AWAL's getting here tomorrow afternoon to be my mega-date, (my dad is so jealous), and then it's four four days of Me, Kup, Drew, Kris, Megan and Ang raising hell in the city.  If you're local, give us a call!  everyone else- have a great weekend/Memorial Day, and remain awesome.

LOOKIN' GOOD, YOUNGBLOOD! GETTIN' PAID, GETTIN' PAID!  until next time -apk

But away from the sappier fanfare, summer is the time for fun, and the movies I’ve seen so far fit the bill.  Van Helsing—solid popcorn movie that’s better and more fun than it has any right to be.  Jackman is damn solid, as is Faromir from Lord of the Rings as the monk-sidekick.  Clever re-imaging of oldschool monsters and good plot twists, and Kate Beckinsale as the hottest heroine on celluloid (at least until my girlfriend Keira returns later this summer).  Troy—Everything I wanted out of it and more.  Sure, there was no interaction with the gods, and that was sort of a bummer, but the “This is how it REALLY happened” feel to the flick actually worked, and was used cleverly.  Brad Pitt, action star? Who’dathunk it would work, but it did, and the Hector/Achilles fight instantly became one of my hands down movie favorites.
