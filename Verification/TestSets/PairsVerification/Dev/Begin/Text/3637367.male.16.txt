"If you want to be one of us all you have to do is dress like us, talk like us, and listen to the same music we do.... Oh yeah, and you have to hate conformists." -  Matt Stone and Trey Parker     What is the perfect life? To many it seems that success, wealth, and status answer that question all to well, and yet, I disagree. We live our lives in pursuit of what we think will make us happy, but what we THINK will make us happy, and what actually will make us happy, are two very different things. Lets take for example, physical appearance. Every human in the world thinks about their appearance dozens of times a day. As a race, we are extremely self-conscious, which is to be expected as we are also extremely appearance-orientated in all aspects of life. Makeup products, plastic surgery, clohing and apparel, all of these areas are multi-billion dollar industries, and this is not by accident. But why is it that we are so engrossed in appearances that we are willing to throw away so much money to improve them? That is an answer, I fear I will never have.    The fact of the matter is, however, that beauty is a losing-battle. All to often we are bombarded with images of beautiful models, sex, status, and style in everything we read, watch, and hear. We are told how to dress, what is cool, what music is good, and what is beautiful.What strikes me as amusing is that despite all our vanity,and superficiality we fail to realize how fickle appearances really are. We see it everyday on television, and throughout the media, love, relationships, marriage, everything which we consider personal seems to be appearance orientated. Intelligence, personality, we say they are the most important factors in attraction, but in this we only succeed in fooling one person: ourselves. Beauty is cruel master, and bows to no person. We define beauty through appearances, but physical appearances have a tendancy to fade with time. No matter how beautiful a person may seem at age 20, they too will one day age, and with their years lose that title. There is a popular cliche that says "Beauty is only skin-deep," but therein lies the distuinguishment between appearances and reality. To many, beauty appears to be what we see, and yet in reality it is much more. As long as we fail to recognize the reality, we will fail to break free from the chains of superficiality that bind us so powerfully.    Furthermore, it cannot be denied Money and power are the calling cards of success in our society, and the indicators by which we judge a person's worth. But as someone once said a few decades ago, "All the money in the world wont buy you more life." So why is it that we drain away the majority of our life in the pursuit of money, and status? From ages 3-63 we spend on average 5 hours a day either in school, or at work, and f
