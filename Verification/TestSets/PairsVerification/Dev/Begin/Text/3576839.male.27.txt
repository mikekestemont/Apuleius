In the Idaho National Guard we are often told to "be Gumby," or to be incredibly flexible.  Well this last weekend we all practiced our Gumby skills once again as we packed our section equipment and our personal equipment to meet us in Fort Bliss.  The packing of the equipment is not a big deal, you pack up your duffel bags, through them in a pile, and pack up your section equipment in a big box.  My section, the Medic section, has very little in the way of equipment.  Especially when compared to other sections, such as the mechanics.  No, the true test of our Gumbiness came when we were told that rather than leaving on 1 July we were leaving on 3 July.  Why is that a problem?  What trauma could that possibly cause by telling us that we have an extra 2 days to spend with our loved ones?  There is, as so often happens, more to the story than that. Over the course of our "2 weeks in the summer" training we were told often and LOUDLY that if there was any information to be told, we would be among the first to know.  Essentially the leadership, specifically the commander and first sergeant, said that media was not "in the know" and should information become available, we would be told by our chain of command.  The media was not a good source of information as far as our deployment goes.  So, more than a week ago, the newspaper reported that the unit would be leaving on 3 July to head to Fort Bliss to start training.  We all knew that the paper couldn't be right, since that information hadn't come down to us through the proper channels.  In light of this, when one soldiers mother asked if she should get her ticket for vacation for a date after 3 July, that soldier said "No, don't waste your vacation time just because the newspaper screwed up on the date."  Her concern was to be able to see her son off as he flew out.  Fast forward from then to this last weekend, and on Sunday afternoon, after spending the whole weekend working with the very people that knew all of the correct details, they finally decided that it was important enough to let the rest of us in on it.   Being Gumby gets REALLY frustrating REALLY fast.
This is, as you can see, the first entry in what I hope will be fairly regular updates to my weblog.  It made sense to me, as I don't know how much time I will have once my unit gets activated to send out letters and/or emails to everyone that I would like to.  This will serve as a forum for people to get a glimpse into life as it unfolds throughout the deployment.  As it stands now, on 8 June, 2004, we are all anxiously waiting out Mobilization date of 1 July.  On that date my unit will move from Lewiston, Idaho to Fort Bliss, Texas.  For those of you who a
