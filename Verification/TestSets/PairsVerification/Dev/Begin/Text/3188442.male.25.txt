Well, hello everybody.  Seeing as a bunch of thoughts tend to pop in and out of my head on a minute-to-minute basis, I thought I should probably write some of those thoughts down so I don't forget everything.  :^)  So read on if you'd like to hear what I have to say about various topics.  Mostly, I'll probably be ranting & raving about anything from politics to space to computers.  And for all of you geeks out there, don't worry, there will be plenty of dorkiness to go around.  Oh, by the way, if you'd like to know more about me & what's going on in my life, just view my  urlLink journal blog .  Enjoy!....        ....or don't!
Well, we left from New York on Tuesday, June 1 to visit some friends from my Stanford days. Mike was another M.S. student with me at Stanford. We worked in the same lab, under the same professor, and took classes together. Needless to say, we were good friends. His wife Sue has got to be one of the nicest people you could meet.  They have two awesome kids, Sam &amp; Sarah. I had seen Sam when he was just a month old. He was born just before I graduated. But I hadn't seen Sarah at all. They're both a couple of great kids. Sam &amp; I had apparently kept in contact with through some sort of telepathic connection. Although, I wasn't aware of it. As soon as we got there he decided that I was his best buddy. I carried him all over the place. And if I set him down, he wanted right back up again. It was actually a lot of fun. Although, getting pee on your arm isn't my favorite past-time. :-)    urlLink     Here's a picture of Mike &amp;amp; Sam.  Gotta' love the baby backpack!  urlLink      West Point had to be the most relaxing portion of our trip. I was really impressed with how beautiful the area was. There are rolling mountains, tons of trees, the hudson river. It was awesome. And the base itself is built in a very neat way, lots of block &amp; stone. It would be hard to visit there as a young man and not want to become an Army officer.  Besides just hanging around the house &amp; relaxing, we took a tour of the base on a bus. They told us some neat little bits of history and gave us a good overview of everything that goes on. The place has just as much history as Boston.     urlLink     Here's a picture of the front of the cadet barracks.  Notice the beautiful Cadet Chapel further up the hill.  urlLink     I guess that's pretty much it. It was great to see Mike &amp; Sue again. I hope we can meet up from time to time as we get older. They have a great little family going there.
