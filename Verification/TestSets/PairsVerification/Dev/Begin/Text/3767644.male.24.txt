I am paid to speak. I love this. Took them batches like always, Gave a short 7 minute intro into need of documentation for software developers. Feelin on top of ze world man.  Life is for the living soul Live it larger than Life................
Thane Centre.  Took my batches like always. returned in 2 and half hours, took a seminar on IT careers. God I'm good !  Sometimes You feel so lone that life seems like it is meaningless, My friends at Thane centre were more than happy to see me just as much as I was to see them. These are good people. My dearest kid was there too. I hope she picked up a lesson on saying no when needed.  If i could change the world I would wish a lot of people like the ones I know well. I could get them the world.  I think i am too tied up at times.  I am such a loser I think. My life is lone. I lost all i could have procured,  1) Education 2) Time 3) The women i like (never thought i was fit enough for them anyway.)  I hate to be called a Winner, each time I am called one I realize how much I've lost. Maybe it is my ego, my depression, I try hard to make people laugh but then how much can I fool Myself. I am the fool who plays the fool. I dont have to pretend.
Fairweather Flowers.  I smell the sweet country side, Whilst I wander the meadows, The grass, fresh from the morning dew, Sways bringing my memories to life  When I would run through the tall grasses, I had her beside me, following, I wished then as i wish now, She stays on, through all times.  Why should I feel a tear roll, Moist should becomes my eyes, tearful, I knew dreams fade away at dawn, Someday I shall realize the same.  The morning mist has faded down, To reveal a land kissed by its presence, I pick up a fairweather flower Fresh, pretty like the girl I knew.   (C) Copyright Ritesh Nair 2004
How much does a life cost????????????? How much des love cost?        Some questions, that are so damn well formatted with bullets and numbering in my miserable life. Why do I even try to escape in this life. I am cursed to live on like this with out love.  You ask me why am i so sad? well I'm not sad i am a crazy lunatic, who does not like losing out to anything or anyone in life.     All along the lonesome highway, east of Omaha, you can hear the engine moaning out as one song. You can think about the woman or the girl you knew the life before. But your thoughts will soon be wandering like the way they always do, When you are riding 16 hours and there is nothing much to do, and you  dont feel much like travelling, you just wish the trip was through.      Here I am, on the road again, H
