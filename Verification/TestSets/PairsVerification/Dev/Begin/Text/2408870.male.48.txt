The other night Radio National had Philip Adams interviewing  urlLink Daniel Ellsberg  about his book  urlLink Secrets: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers.

Found this strange little  urlLink archive   of machine translated text when I googled term  Hot Adelaide :   When me this thought came, I was even before the carpet seaweeds, which zierte at that time each backyard and thus also our meadow, because she had the function of a backyard, in which one beat out evenly also the carpets of the dwelling.
