Like most PC / *NIX users I'm an admitted MAC stalker.  I read the  urlLink rumor   urlLink sites , I gaze at G5s through the Apple store glass and think someday..someday I will walk in and drop the cash..  Then I realize that would be foolish, and dream of days in which OS X will be ported to the x86 architecture.  A dream that will hopefully someday come true..    Back when OS X was first created (from BSD) Apple realized that their current PowerPC architecture was sucking and decided to keep a current OS X port running on x86 machines (x86 instruction set = Intel, AMD for newbies).  This project was codenamed 'Marklar' and currently employs about a dozen fulltime Apple programmers.  Consider this Apple's backup plan should the PowerPC fail to keep up with Intel / AMD microprocessors.  Of course Apple doesn't admit that the 'Marklar' program even exists, but I've heard differently.    Anyhow... enough with the Apple history channel – today I stumbled across a PowerPC emulator for Linux & Windows by the name of  urlLink PearPC .  I've heard of things like this in the past, but this time I was told people are successfully running  urlLink OS X  inside of Windows.  And let me tell you,  urlLink it works !  Now don't get too stoked yet, there are some problems as this is the 0.1 release... in other words, alpha at best.    Here are the details you need to know:  - It's slow, very very slow – as in 286 SX slow, as in iTunes for Windows slow... you get the idea.  - Certain machines work, others don't.  From what I've seen in the forums it's about a 50/50 shot it will work on your PC.  - You must own OS X  - Lots of bugs.. think of it as a proof of concept for the time being.    All that being said – If your like me, you'll want to install it anyways.  So follow these instructions exactly: (down and dirty instructions – I recommend this as a  urlLink prerequisite )    1. Download  urlLink PearPC-JITC  and extract it to c:\pearpc  2. Download and install  urlLink Alcohol 120%   3. Download the  urlLink Darwin PPC .ISO  and save it to c:\pearpc  4. Download these configuration files and save them to c:\pearpc –  urlLink File 1 ,  urlLink File 2    5. Download and extract  urlLink this file  to c:\pearpc (takes some time to extract as this is the 6GB hard drive image – use WinRAR)    6. Now use Alcohol 120% to create an ISO image of OSX 10.3 disk 1.  Name it osx.iso and save it to your c:\pearpc directory  7. Follow  urlLink these instructions  and partition the new 6GB virtual drive – (from a command prompt run 'ppc ppccfg.darwin') - no need to install darwin.  8. Now run 'ppc ppccfg.osx' from the command prompt     Step 8 will boot you into the OS X installation – install and enjoy... As you will see in the forum links below, everyone is having different results.  Remember, it takes awhile and it's n
