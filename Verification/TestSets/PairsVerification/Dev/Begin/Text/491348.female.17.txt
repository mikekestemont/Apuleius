Restless tonight 'cos I wasted the light between both these times I drew a really thin line  It's nothing I planned and not that I can But you should be mine across that line  If I traded it all If I gave it all away for one thing Just for one thing... If I sorted it out If I knew all about this one thing Wouldn't that be something?  I promise I might not walk on by Maybe next time but not this time  Even though I know I don't want to know Yeah, I guess I know I just hate how it sounds  If I traded it all If I gave it all away for one thing Just for one thing... If I sorted it out If I knew all about this one thing Wouldn't that be something?

P2 was absolutely horrible. The trig question took me more than 10 minutes to do, and I still couldn't do it. (But then again, I'm stupid.) Actually most people found it quite difficult, but I'm sure I'm the only Further Maths person who lost more than 15 marks already. AHHH well... That's life.   Still got M2 on Friday... AHHHHHHHHHhhhhhhh~~~
Ahhhhh.....
People always ask me why I'm so concerned about my weight. They think I'm too obsessed, they say I'm not fat, but that really isn't the point. It's not that I want to look fit, or that I care so much about looks.  I don't think there's anything to be proud about. Being good-looking, I mean. You're born with it. It's not like you have a choice, or that you can do anything about it. So I really don't understand girls who are so proud of themselves for being pretty. It's not like you even did anything for it. You were born that way. We don't choose to be ugly, do we?  But being thin and keeping fit is a whole different thing. It's something you can actually work for. It means something. To keep fit and be thin you need to control your diet, resist temptation on yummy sweets/fattening food; you need to exercise, not be lazy, etc. If you can't even control your weight, how can you control your own life?
Got rid of 5 exams today, and all I want to do is SLLEEEPPPP....  'Cos... I skipped all the lessons on Monday, and sat in my room, with my Biology textbook and revision guide, and studied from 9:00am until 5:00pm. During which I took several small breaks to the loo and one large break to lunch including internet time of 30mins. After that I went to tea (dinner).  After 7:00pm I sat in my room with my Music Anthology and Past Papers and revised until... 11:00pm. During which I took several small breaks to Elisabeth's room.  After 11:00pm (lights-out time), I took a flashlight and revised the musical d
