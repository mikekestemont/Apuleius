I think saturdays would be ideal to catch the 'Simple Life' where you see Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie rough it out in life. In fact, in a lot of ways these two girls kind of represent the majority of Singaporeans (not that we look like them or have their financial standing) but we are quite as lucky as these two girls. We have a shelter over our head, food, clothes and time to time able to indulge in other additional leisures in life. To say we are spoilt - it is probably too harsh... But we are in fact far more fortunate than a lot of people. Of course, we shouldn't compare ourselves with other countries but sometimes when we do comparisons, we are more easily grounded.  Many many of us (including me) haven't had a chance (or maybe we had) rough it out - just like the girls in Simple Life. I am guilty as charged :) I guess to rough it out doesn't mean we have to torture ourselves or do extreme stuff in life but I have seen people roughing it out from scratch. When I was in New York for my vacation in 1999, that's when I turn 21 there (Gosh, it feels like several years ago). I met an American guy who was 40 - nice breed of Dennis Quaid + Keifer Sutherland. Well, we hooked up and he took me around. Yeah, it was fun. Had deep conversations and from it I realised... He was just a grad from high school. He left florida and went to NYC (worked in Gap for 10 years) before he then became assistant manager in boutiques. Then, he heads 6 boutiques (when I knew him) - but he shifted to Chicago 2 years ago.   I really have a lot of respect for this guy. With his determination and hard work + experience, it was amazing. I mean yeah, qualification can take you places. But seriously, the paper chase in Singapore is way crazy at times. Even my parents jokingly said in 10 years time, you'll need a diploma to be a toilet cleaner. Why do parents equate toilet cleaner as 'Pathetic'? To them,it's like a dead end. But these people who do this job - they don't think so!?   Guess when you advance more in life and become more affluent. Your perspective just either get better or twisted. I wish I knew what we were doing on Earth sometimes. What is beyond the galaxy? Are we in a box? I think Life is so beautiful but emotions can cut us like a chopping board. Why does it hurt even more than a physical pain? Sean came and took the house key from me today. We met at Bugis. It was complete silence. I could kind of see tears in his eyes but I had to keep myself composed. I just couldn't stay there any longer. My memories would come back again like a dormant volcano. It would all gush out and boil me into fragments. Everytime what h
