Okay, I've waited a bit to write this, hoping something interesting would happen...but, alas...nothing. So, let's see. The most interesting thing I did last night was let Jason draw a temporary tattoo on my arm. I didn't watch (hello, men's gymnastics was on!) so when he got done, what a surprise! I had a....um...winged vagina with a halo over it on my arm. YIKES! Interesting, but yikes!!! I did find out that I will finally get the last of the money that Northwest owes me on friday...just in time to spend it all at Melissa's bachelorette party *LOL*  Anyhoo....Tomorrow is my last full day here at work. EEEEKKKKSSS!!! I'm nervous. Very. Very. Nervous.  Sooo... here is the website of the day...I've been told it's very funny, but you have to have sound, which I don't, and Quicktime, which I don't. Sooo...if it's bad...don't blame me!!!    urlLink  http://www.somethingdirectory.com/main_emo.htm
Mornin!      Hope you all are wonderful today! I'm in a good mood (again, two days in a row! wow!) because I'm wearing my new pink shoes! *LOL* Yes...you heard right...I (of all people) own a pair of pink shoes...not just one pair...but TWO!!!! Thank you, Target!       Anyhoo, had to get that out of the way. OMG. I went up to Mark's store to pick up the tape of Sherwood's music, didn't realize it was the INDOOR show. Thanks for telling me that ahead of time, Mark! GRR. And of all the freakin songs Greta had to pick....Fred Durst's remake of Behind Blue Eyes. Gawd, haven't I heard that song enough times on 98.9? Now I have to not only listen to it a bizillion more times....I HAVE TO WRITE A SHOW TO IT!!! *screams* NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! So, yeah. Fun Fun. Thanks Greta!      Also talked to Cardiff, stopping by tonight to help her a bit with West's color scheme and flags. I hope she get's the silk in soon, I told her I'd make them (for a ~small~ fee, of course *winks*) but my time is rapidly disappearing. EEKS!!! School starts in 6 days!!! I'm getting so nervous...but at least I have all of my books.       So, yeah...that's about it for today, except for....       THE WEBSITE OF THE DAY!!!     urlLink http://www.empoweredproducts.com/product_one.php?id=5    This lovely product will make a great addition to yesterdays *winksNgiggles* Enjoy, all!

Mine is wonderful so far...didn't fall asleep on the drive in, am wearing a new shirt (always guaranteed to make a glorious day ;-)) and I'm actually getting used to getting up at 6am. Wow, I can't believe I just said that. Yuck. Anyway! Last night was good, got a lot done. I finally got some info regarding Sherwood (Sherman, Sherwood, whatever!) and where I'll be sleeping....AT THE SPONSER'S HOUSE!!! Please, pray, meditate, send me good thoughts, SOMETHING!!! I'll  so  need it!!! :-( And here I was, looking forward to getting a hotel room with Jason and having a little mini-vacation. GRR.       I also talked to Sheri, the S
