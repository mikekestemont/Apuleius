Disclaimer: This is a true story. And therefore, also long and a wee bit boring. Apologies.  Dragging myself to my last lecture of the semester, in the early hours of the afternoon, I felt quietly confident about the prospect of my life not changing much in the following 24 hours. I was going through the motions - feigning interest in what the lecturer was saying, engaging in epic battles with the audio-visual equipment for my own presentation, and passing around biscuits. My relief at having survived the semester perhaps left me a bit short of oxygen to the brain, because the next thing I knew I was fraternizing wildly with "George" (Oh, who am I trying to kid? That is his real name) at the pub. Oblivious.  [NB. George is a guy I'm always sitting next to and eating (for some reason) mandarins in front of. We never speak properly. He usually starts a conversation but unfortunately I happen to be eating a mandarin and only manage to nod and smile. Once, I tried chasing the mandarin with a coffee (not recommended) and that got a semi-decent chat going between us. Ahh, but then I leaped away to the ladies (like a gazelle). Maybe he got the impression that I'm aloof and interesting from my garbled silences and bounding away at unexpected moments. Maybe the whole "act like a cat" routine really does work. Fancy that...]  Anyway, we all have stories about drunken liasons but I have to confess this was my first. All previous liasons were very straightforward and in no way involved people I studied/worked with. Did my standards take a massive tumble over the last 5 years? No doubt, being single for a year and the coldness of the winter months did sway me a little. This combination is trouble, driving us all into the arms of nice but incredibly unlikely people in the most unlikely ways.   So we end up going off campus to catch up with my friends. They leave the pub at 10pm. An incredibly drunk-in-a-philosophical-way guy pulls up a chair and engages in a debate with us about whether the statement "Elvis was a Redneck" is justified - we began in the affirmative because he took the negative and eventually both parties slid towards a middle-ground - very excitng stuff to watch diplomacy in action (in this case mine, cos the guys seemed intent on holding on to their own prejudices). Before we knew it it was 3am. What a stupid time of the morning to be roaming about with a "friend" who happens to live 5 minutes away. Oblivious still.  Did I mention that he wanted a pit-stop at his place, before we headed to the pub with my friends, to "find his keys"? The quotation marks are more there because of my feelings in hindsight than from any real mistrust of George. And he did end up having to borrow his housemates keys after all. And I got to see his total demolition site of a room, replete with drum kit (
