I should really write in this at night, instead of here at work. Problem is I can't find time to write at night. I'm too sleepy and am really tired of thinking. School and work will do that too you. Grr...oh well. I get to go see Ferrick tonight. That's all way exciting. Problem is I won't see Ferrick friends there and well, Lauren will be there and not that Lauren is a bad person, she's just not my favorite person to go to a Ferrick concert with. I'm supposed to go see Catie Curtis with her too, I'm almost hoping she backs out and I have to find someone to take the ticket. Perhaps I'll have a better time. No, that's a really bad way to think of things. Think of the evening like that and it will be bad. Ugh...ok well, I'm going to go find Mark now, so I can get some work done before Ellen shows up. Grrr...Ellen...
Lots going on. Been a long day at work and it's still not over. I have class tonight as well. Ugh. See 'Us' for description of work day. Um...yeah...write more later I spose. Weary me is off to pretend to work more.
Ok so I finally have a phone. That's always nice. Not necessesarily beacuse I need to call anyone, but because I'm an internet junky.  Not that you didn't know that already, seeing as though I have a web journal. ;-) Concentric doesn' t have a local access number for where I am in Cleveland. I was forced to steal an AOL disk from my neighbors mailbox (it had been there for 3 days, I swear) and sign up for my 3 free months. That will take me till the end of November. Hopefully I can sign up with Juno or Netzero for the rest of November and December. God that seems so far away. Living alone really isn't all it's cracked up to be. I miss Abby, but even more than that I miss the idea that there is someone who would notice if I never came home, or never left for that matter. There's no one to talk to, no one to cook dinner with, for or for you. I can even go as far to say there's no one to be annoyed with. At least that makes life interesting. Ugh...I have what's going to become a very nasty cold. At this point it's just the runny nose, but I can feel the sore throat and the coughing coming on. Ick. I hate being sick. I think I'm going to go ahead and leave work a bit early. Only by like 15 min and you know what, I plain old don't feel good. I need to drive out to CSU though. Get my book and in general figure out where the place is and about how long it takes to get there. Should be fun. Right.
Ick...I've been neglecting this haven't I. I really shouldn't be typing this at work. I will get a phone in my new a
