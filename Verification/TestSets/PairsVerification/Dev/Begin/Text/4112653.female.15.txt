Lord,      &nbsp;    I praise you for all the freedom you've given us in  Australia. Thank you for letting us worship and live our lives for you freely,  without major persecution.      &nbsp;    I pray for our brothers and sisters overseas who  are facing suffering because they are your children, Lord. Help them in times of  trouble, encourage and strengthen them. As Ramadan approaches, I pray that those  believers who will go through even more persecution are surrounded by your love,  and they stand firm in their faith.       &nbsp;    Father I pray for Daniel, who's not feeling well,  and anybody else who is sick. May you place your healing hand upon us, and help  us to recover quickly, so that we use our gift of health to serve you  fully.      &nbsp;    For those of us at school, I pray that we still  make time for you. I pray that we see you as our Father in Heaven who will  always be there for us, when we're upset, stressed, tired and just sick of it  all. And you'll never get sick of listening to us. How amazing you are, God!!! :  )      &nbsp;    in Jesus' name,  Amen
i'm praying for your friend von!   Heavenly Father,                  Thankyou that when we need help you are there for us and care for us. Thankyou that you help us and guide us and give us all that we need and keep on showing us the way to live better lives for You so that we may be cleansed and ready for what You have for us in Heaven. "Who shall I compare to You, who can reach so deep into my soul, like You my Lord." Lord You know us inside and out and You know what's best for us beacuse You created us. Thankyou for this and that You are in control.   You are eternal, You will never change and your love will never fade, nor will You leave your people.   Please keep us fresh in You and willing to go wherever your path may take us, however challenging it may be - because You were willing to pay the price for us, even if it meant your Son.  Please help us  not  to live for our  own  glory, but for  yours    Your will be done in Jesus' name, Amen
