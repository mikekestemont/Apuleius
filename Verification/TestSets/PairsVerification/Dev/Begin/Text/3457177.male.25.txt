Tonight I headed home on the bus and started to reflect on things, after a pretty good evening with one of my friends. I don't know what it is about the bus or the skytrain, but I always start to think about things when I am on either one of them. The same thing occurs when i go for long walks.   Tonight I pondered how depressed I have been lately and how people who are depressed must feel sad and have a lot of emotional pain. I remember someone saying that people with great sadness or suffering feel compelled to express themselves. For example, many comedians have had a lot of suffering and pain in their past and turn that pain outwards in a expression hummor (ie. comedy). Similarly, in the theatre, there are the two symbolic masks representing joy and sadness. Perhaps to understand joy, one needs to experience sadness. Similarly, to understand sadness one needs to experience joy. One part is not complete without the other and vice-a-versa.  In reflecting on this pain and hummor paradigm, I came across a memory that struck me as rather odd at first. In the movie entitled "Face-Off" with Nickolas Cage and John Travolta, there is a scene where Nick's character has a moment that speaks to this paradigm. Nick plays a drug dealer who's face is stole by a cop played by John Travolta. John's character uses the face to play Nick's character to trick Nick's character's brother to reveal the location of a bomb. Now Nick's character then steals John travolta's character's face and pretends to be John travolta's character. While very confusing and  twisted, it allows for a beautiful scene. In this scene, Nick is playing John travolta's character but he looks like Nick's character and is hanging out with Nick's character's friends. Now you can imagine the pain and suffering that John Travolta's character who looks like Nick's character is feeling. John Travolta's character had a son who was killed by Nick's character in an attempt to kill John Travolta's character.  The scene that I am refering to occurs in the following way. Nick is playing John Travolta's character who looks like Nick's character. During this scene, he is at an apartment and laughing it up with Nick's character's evil friends. He then has this momentary break in playing his enemy's character and almost loses his emotional control in thinking about the loss of his son. He is laughing at one point and then almost crying for an instant. Then he manages to turn that pain around and starts laughing hysterical in joy over his enemy's evil deeds. This moment within the film is so beautiful and spoke to this hummor/pain paradigm. I must give credit to the writers of this movie for understanding this psychological paradigm and to Nick for playing it out so well.
I thought I would reflect on a short documentary type show I was watching on cable the other night. I believe it was called Frontline or some 'objective' sounding title. It told the s
