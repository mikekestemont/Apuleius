Can't wait for the weekend.. Well, tomorrow afternoon in actual fact.  Have booked a weekend down in the snow and will be carving it up on the slopes.  Had a few misgivings about whether there would be any dumping around this time of year, but it seems like an awesome start to the ski season and will be bloody brilliant.  The group I'm going with are an awesome bunch.. Matt, Lu (both my flatmates), Mikey, Tara and Kurt.. Great guys, know how to party and know how to live it up.  Fantastic.    Thanks to Tara's mum, we're going to get spolit rotten tomorrow night with a roast dinner in our Canberra stop off, then it's an early night and we'll be hitting the slopes early Friday morning.  Thank god for kickboxing and those strength exercises I say.. otherwise I'll be hurting after the first hour.   Also looking forward to the Apres skiing. I haven't skied in Australia before, so can't wait to check out the night life on Sat night. Fingers crossed I don't do anything stupid and cane myself. Tara and I are going to be ski buddies for the weekend, so no doubt we'll push each other. You just have to read this email I got from a friend of mine in response to that :   "...I can see tragic headline news like "Freak Accident on slopes for Competitive Freaks"...  A down hill skiing race turned competitive and then tragic for two female Sydnesians and a spectator.  The two birds (Ed.) began competitively racing each other down a difficult slope, when faced with a 'bump' in the snow field which launched the two females airborne in a side by side dual formation, rather reminiscent of the best efforts of Olympic synchronized swimmers.  The feat would have appeared magical for the lone spectator standing further down the slope, until the two would be professional downhill racers hit the spectator before landing, impaling him with a ski each through the midsection. Concerned over damage to their ski's the two speed racers began furiously trying to remove their ski's from the injured spectator, eventually tearing him in two before horrified paramedics could call for the sticky tape.  It's understood both girls were charged with SUI (Skiing Under the Influence) by Police, with a more serious charge of "Skislaughter" pending.  Offers of sponsorship are understood to have been made to both skiers to consider entering this year's Olympics in the demonstration sport of Synchronised Homicidal Skiing..."  Too much time on his hands me thinks !
My girlfriend, Jill, got engaged on the weekend to the most wonderful Pete.  Jill and Pete are my idea of a perfect couple - totally, 100%, in love with each other.. It's a couple like that which restores my faith in relationships where two people can co-exist together for the rest of their lives.  Something which most of us search for, but only a select few actually find..    I feel it's a privledge to know them both.   Jill and I will be organising Jill's birthday on the 17 J
