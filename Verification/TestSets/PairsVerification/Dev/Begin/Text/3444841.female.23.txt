Finally, I've stepped foot upon blogging soil...
I'll bring order to that ass like a drawer of mismatched socks--stacking rhymes like leg blocks. My logic is uncontested, so you'd better step to me rested, no mercy for the nervous, charge your pacemakers b/c I bury imposters on purpose. lol..

Today my job isn't so bad at all..  I get to sit and watch videos to moby, boards of canada, stereolab etc..and type occaisionally. Today, I'm a casual observer of other people's pain. I'm pretending I'm making movies of their lives by switching to different tracks to find the appropriate sounds to which they should march. It's nice. And the hours pass...valgus, varus, valgus, varus. . .right, left, right, left, these people walk down the hallway, crippled with disease, but trying to keep a smile on their face, b/c...the camera's watching, and it's only appropriate that they look like they're enjoying themselves. Moby's "why does my heart feel so bad?" is quite appropriate. Back to work..

"Please do not remove this note,I am trying to work in peace and quietness." (copied straight from the door)
I absolutely love the skeletons of buildings, especially at night when the metallic frames are ablaze with moonlight and 60watt bulbs. All the ants with hard hats have gone home to rest their weary antennae and leave me to look upon their day's work.  It's been such a long sad time since I've been turned on...like pulsing so hard all over that I'm vibrating. Terrible isn't? I feel like I need new batteries. [But what does THAT mean?] I do and don't mean 'turned on' in a sexual sense, but more so in a much more general way.  Remember those books, Where is Waldo? Your eyes would rape the pages in search for his striped sweater, and then when you found him, there would be this sigh of relief like you'd just recovered the child you'd lost in the grocery store isles. But..do you remember the look on waldo's face? This blind stare. It seemed to me, that he didn't want to be found..I feel like him today. But just today.

sitting in one coffee shop of many, sucking up wireless internet like a junkie..so i'm nearing my leave. 40 days and I'm leaving Athens for good. People keep asking me if I'm scared or nervous. I keep saying no, because I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be afraid of--am I just being naive or am I really void of fear? For some reason, I feel like most of my life has been I've been i
