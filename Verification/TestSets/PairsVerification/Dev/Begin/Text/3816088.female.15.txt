So these last 2 days have been like a huge depressing fest. Bens car that he has been working soo hard on for the past few months got a little boo boo. He was driving in the rain and it took in some water and so now he needs a whole new engine. I just feel so bad because that car is like his love (well one of them at least) He works soo hard on it and to see it all the sudden get damaged this way makes me feel soo bad and sad. I am having some of the worst simpathy pains!  Also he has been getting sicker and sicker by the day. His eyes are becoming all poofy and he is all itchy in select spots. (YOU DONT LOOK LIKE AN OLD MAN THOUGH BEN!!) I have been trying to go and visit him the most that I can because he means so much to me and I care so much for him. Ben is like one of the greatest friends a person could possibly ask for! He is there for you when you need him even if he is really busy he will make time for you. I dont think I could ever thank him enough for being such a great friend. I hate seeing him soo down and depressed and I cant wait to see him smile again! I really wish that I could do more than just sit at his bedside or write him a get well card. I really wish I could work miracles and make this bad dream go away or get him the money to get his new engine. (I AM giving him $500 though whether he likes it or not). But right now I guess all I can do is pray for the best for him and comfort him. I just wish I could do more!! :/ Ben- I love you and you mean soo much to me. I would hate to ever loose you and I just hope you feel better soon. I cant wait to see your smile again and to see you happy. I think that would be one of the most rewarding days of my life! I love you!! -heather

I just need to work on it a lot so I might acctually look descent when I do it. Then from 6-7 we have like a break and we always just run over to Target and get a bite to eat and then head back for jazz class. Well me and Mariah really dont like jazz and it was also raining like cRaZy!! By the time we all got into Target (Kelly, Mariah and I) we were all drenched so we sat and ate and talked and kelly then called her mom to come and get her t
