Not much to talk about anymore.  Stepped into a new echelon of the human condition.  I think I may get horns installed into my forehead. They seem more fitting.
I see the ugliness in everything.  I see the smog that has tainted our skies.  I see the horror that blackens the rays of sun.  I see the poison that darkens the clouds.  I see the pestilence that strangles the trees.  I see the sludge that pollutes the vast ocean.  Call me whatever you will, I see it.  I see that we have made this earth hideous, and that there is not a single thing that has been spared our vile touch.  But I also see the beauty in everything.  In the flowers, in the faces of humans, in everything. Everything has its own beauty. The only problem with me is that I can see everything that has corrupted it. I, alone, can see the truth.   Robert Zend wrote an interesting little poem, called "World's Shortest Pessimistic Poem" and it reads:    Hope?
Just now I realized I've spelt irrevocable wrong for the last little while. O well, it's not like I can go back and CHANGE it. God forbid anything should ever change.   My Guardian Angel status has been revoked. The woman I tried to care for, the woman I tried to help, has fled from me. I knew I would not be able to help her if I could not help myself.   I remember back to a day, it must've been in february or so, although I'm not entirely sure. Her, her boyfriend and I were all in my room, him and I were watching TV.

I remember him leaving the room, and me saying to her, that "our destinies had become intertwined." What that meant was that everything that happened to him or to I would affect the other, in much the same way as it did with her. My desinty had now been spun in three directions. One with her. One with her boyfriend. One with me. They must've thought I was full of shit at the time, but now I realize that my prediction was (as always, haha) correct.   She should be back in town very soon. I have not heard from her in a while. I fear I will not recognize her when she returns. Although I know I will.  My little island is drifting farther and farther off the coastline, although, the entire time I knew it would.
Well, I'm at my dad's house right now, he's out of town for 5 days, he told me he didn't quite know where, himself, but he figured he would just go wherever the wind would take him.  He has h
