I question myself on a daily basis. I never feel sure about much. I can recall only a few times in my life that I  knew  that what I was doing was right. To go through life feeling so uneasy about myself is like constantly being short of breath.  I knew it was right to keep Chiara. I know now that it is right for this baby growing inside me to be with another couple. The part that confuses me is why did it feel right to keep one child and now it feels right to let someone else be parents to this child? Breathe.  Some days I actually feel up and my outlook is less dreary. Then I lay in bed at night and it all creeps back...my questions, my fears, how I got here in the first place. My limbs become tense, and ache. My breath, again, escapes me. On god nights I fall asleep and do not dream. On good nights I believe that in the end it will all be worth the anxiety and the pain. On good nights I can catch my breath.  Breathe...Chiara...Breathe...
Have you ever thought about all of the other possibilities out there?  Is life so full of distractions for so many people that we don't even see the opportunities we have before us?  Or do we see them and just ignore that they may actually be good ideas?  It seems like we limit ourselves before we even give ourselves a chance.  I see all the stuff life has put on me, all the things that are/were other people's faults and kept me from being or doing what I need or want.  I've just started to realize that some of those reasons are true but that I have kept myself down more than anything or anyone.  This makes me really uncomfortable and somewhat alarmed.  I've been fighting the world for so long and its unfairness that I've lost sight of myself.  How I act or react fucks me up more than I'd like to admit sometimes.  There is a lot of sweetness too.  I have a lot of great memories of life and that hasn't been tainted.  I guess it wasn't luck that made those good things happen.  I think good stuff comes out of bad situations that were handled well or when a risk was taken...when I let myself be vulnerable or just let down my guard in some way.  Life is so frustrating...I want to be financially independent but if I want to succeed in the long run I gotta suck it up that I got a shitty car, no money no social life and live with mom and dad.  Having Chiara is no doubt amazing, but I am torn between being a mom, a student, being "single", and needing to work.  I have already been given two absolutely amazing little girls...  They are my reminders that when I accept my responsibilities and take a risk once in a while, life's rewards are definitely worth all the other shit.
I'm such a d
