my mother died seven years ago today.  she died of breast cancer.  they say these things usually skip a generation, which means i'm safe but that if had kids, they wouldn't be.  my mother was a very cheerful woman.  she had a unique laugh and her eyes would shrink whenever she was happy you couldn't see the white in her eyes anymore.  she was so easy to please.  i'd get good grades, she'd smile.  i'd get her a new blouse, she'd smile.  i'd sing her a song, she'd smile.   i wish  all  people were that easily content.  she was a very giving woman.  they were 10 children in the family, not counting her half-brothers and half-sisters.  she was the fourth child of my grandparents and she took care of each and every one of my aunts and uncles.  she'd help my aunts find work, she'd lend her brothers money and she was nice to all their kids even when they weren't exactly nice, grateful and respectful to her. she'd give them stuff even before they could ask.  she was very giving to my dad.  i don't know how i manage to put up with my dad, but she could and she did one hell of a job,too.   she was very supportive of him, even when he wasn't exactly right all the time.  she said she loved him the first time she laid eyes on him.  and love him with all her might, she did.  my mother was very strong and brave woman.  her faith in the Lord was unwavering.  you couldn't really tell she was sick until you saw her scars and she gave a big fight until her last breath. when she left, she was smiling.  i miss you, mama.  thank you for watching over me.
i've always loved Alanis Morissette.  i love her music, i love her angst. i got all her albums and i even bought a vcd copy of Dogma because she played God there.she was the angry white female, i was the angry brown female. for some weird reason, she could put into words and music the things i couldn't whine about.  it's like Jessica Zafra, only Alanis is more musical and Jessica is limited to writing and whining.  my college classmates told me i could do a great rendition of Alanis' songs. it's how i got into a band in UE.  they said i nailed Hand In My Pocket so bad they thought they were listening to the radio. the pleasure is mine :)  when i had a haircut after the breakup, Alanis' new video for her new single Everything came out. a friend pointed out that i was trying to copy her again which is weird considering she is considerably happy in the arms of Ryan Reynolds (Van Wilder, Two Guys and a Girl) while i am very much unattached.  she is unexplicably happy that she doesn't look like Dave Grohl's long lost sister anymore(rumor has it that Taylor Hawkins agreed to be  urlLink The Foo Fighters'  drummer because Dave looked so much like A
