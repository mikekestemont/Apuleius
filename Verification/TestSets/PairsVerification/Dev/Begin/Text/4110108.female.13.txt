Okay, I just had to post before the night was over. And to cover up that friggin large entry o.o I do that always, trust me.      Eeh. I wish I could make my own layout for this... but my website isn't ready yet, and the HTML is too complex. Besides, I'm too tired to sift through all of the HTML. Why I kinda wanna go back to Diaryland...      Speaking of which,   Derek got a Gold membership on Diaryland, which makes me really sad 'cause I just left Diaryland!!! I wanted a Gold Membership too! Grr... x.x I hate my not-being-able-to-listen-when-I'm-blogging.      Well, at least this template is to my liking. Still wish that Derek told me, but then again, I doubt he woulda got me a Gold, it's 30 dollars. *sighs*      Ne. The only time I'm going to be using a credit card for anything is A) the next time my sister wants me to do something on EBay, or B) when I get mah domain name. Which won't be soon. I'm actually WONDERING if I'm getting one anymore, because I'm so totally indoubt that I will.      Tommorrow... summer school. Math. Then the shop. And Derek will be going to his second school, so no Derek. *sighs* More boredom. I hate this week, or how it's turning out so far.      *whacks her head against the screen* Ne. I really dislike how this week is coming out... I shoulda gone to church or something this morning. I woulda felt better about today.      *sighs*      Eeh. I don't know. I'm not looking forward to my brain falling out tommorrow. What I GUESS I could look forward to is playing Pokemon Sapphire some more, but come on - I've had it for two weeks and already I have almost 100 hours.      I dunno. Call me a complainer, I think it's just that I'm tired and slightly annoyed about the week and my current posture. Ever since I've gotten that game I've been killing my back...      I'm wondering if I'll meet any friends through this blog right now... I got this blog 'cause a kind-of friend of mine, Finni, has one, but she actually understands this HTML, unlike me. I mean, I understand the just of it, I just don't know how to create a layout as complex as one of these. I understand a lot of HTML, but I've only been in that area for about two years, so...      Oh - here's a song I FINALLY finished, called Chance. I wrote it back when me and my good friend, Alex, were together, and I finally finished it because I sang it today to Derek. My vocals have improved, thank goodness, so it sounded really good... I wish my microphone was working so I could record it. But anyway, here's Chance.       Hold me close again     Like you did before the summer end     Another year has gone by     A simple wish     That's carried away with your kiss     Seems like I have wings to fly      Now nothing can go wrong     With me in your arms     As long as y
