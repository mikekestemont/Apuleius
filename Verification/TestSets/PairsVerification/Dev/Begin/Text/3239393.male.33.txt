Again - read this too late to post - too late to recall too much.  Had a quick reread then - David again strikes me as such a great man - full of sin and yet repentant - and trusting in God's decisions on what to do with that sin.
Did it late and so did not post - basically rules for establishing a priesthood - with lots of reminders that the only way a sinful man can approach a Holy God is via something dying in our place.
Be Generous  God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work.   How awesome is that verse - we have all we need - so that we will abound in every good work - good works that [ephesians?] says we were made for called for to carry out, good work that God had prepared in advance for us to do :D SO GIVE, give generously, God will supply all you need and enough to do all the good he planned for you to do :D  Be Obedient  For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does.

SO women have a role, and have always had a role in a church, and in churching and it is not to always be silent. Worship IS to be orderly, but not heartless and unemotional, not so structured you squeeze anywhere for the spirit to move us. Tongues are to be desired - but they are for personal edification and so not to be blurted out when we are churching - unless someone is there who can interrupt and thus, edify all the believers who are churching together. Men [in fact all believers] are to dress modestly and in accordance with the way the society the church meets in says expressed respect and honour to God - and yet w
