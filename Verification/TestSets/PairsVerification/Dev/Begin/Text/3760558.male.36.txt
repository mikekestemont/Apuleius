As if we didn't have enough action yesterday with the gas issue, today brought another line of traffic passing through Arnosvale. You see, earlier this morning, a small, private twin engine plane was taking off from the airport when it veered off the runaway and crashed into the fence opposite Greaves Supermarket. Luckily nobody was hurt but you know Vincentians, whenever something happens, rather than avoid the area, within minutes, you have about 5000 peoples there and no traffic could move. Right up to seven tonight, there was still traffic coming out of town and still a small crowd gathered discussing all kind of things about the crash. All of a sudden we have 50 experts on plane crashes and how ir happened and who was to blame and how they could move the plane and..........well, you get the drift.  With all this action going on I wonder what tomorrow would bring? we shall see.
Here's a big country question - What do you think is happening when you pass into a gas station and you have to line up for 30 minutes just to get some gas? most would probably say everyone wants to fill up before a bank holiday or maybe the people working at the gas station is on strike or a go slow or even prices are going up at midnight and everyone wants to fill up before the prices change. Well in a big country thats probably the case but here in Vincy, things are not that straightforward. You have to remember that we don't have any oil deposits that we can pump so we have to import it. Shell and Texaco are the suppliers and every week you'll see one of thir ships in port pumping gas into numerous storage tanks. Well it so happened today that one of the tankers went to the gas station in Villa and off loaded its content. The station opened back up and cars and buses started to fill up. The problem was that someone made a mistake and put deisal into the regular gas storage so the station was pumping the wrong type. What a ting!!! the shell station had to close and everyone ended up going to Texaco for gas causing a huge line. The thing is, they were now running out of gas causing a general shortage. Another boat is due in next week, hopefully before we seriously have shortages accross the country. As they say.......only in St Vincent!!!!!!
OK, OK, I missed a day but what do you expect living on an island. Nobody's rushed here you know, think people do things on time? take for example today, the company I work for is flat out busy trying to get prepared for the 30th June deadline for the ISPS (International Ship and Port Security) code that would take effect from 1st July. You see, this code was introduced after the 9-11 thingy in the US, every port need to comply with a set of rules that Uncle Sam drew up. Now that was years ago but a
