I am the luckiest girl in the world. It’s 11:30 at night, and all I can think about besides my intense desire for sleep, is that in less than 48 hours, I won’t have to sleep alone. My guy is coming out to see me.  I say “my guy” because there is no better term to use. I’ve tried the “boyfriend” term, but I hate that. It sounds so high school. Junior high school even. (Although I don’t mind him using the word girlfriend. In fact, he better be using the word girlfriend a whole lot.) And all the other words sound wrong too. “Significant Other” sounds either snobby or gay. “Other Half” implies that I’m only half a person on my own. My friend Kris calls her live-in boyfriend her “split-apart” because they use it in some movie. But as of yet, I haven’t found a term I like. So I use boyfriend and cringe or, I say “my guy.”  Well, no matter what I call him, he’s coming to see me and I’m so excited. I think that this is quite possibly the most romantic gesture any man has ever shown me. I was just out in NJ. In fact, I went out there to see him “one last time” before I went to basic.

I tricked myself into believing that he was all I deserved. All I’d ever get. And I loved him. So I stayed. When Justin and I broke up, we decided to still live together. We still slept together, only now it was ok for him to sleep with other girls. I didn’t date, I didn’t want to.  One night I fell asleep waiting for Justin to come home. When I woke up the lights were on downstairs, and I could hear talking in the front room. There was a girl’s voice. He had picked up some girl in the Albertson’s parking lot. When I walked downstairs, she was on top of him. I was so angry that I called a friend and had him pick me up. That night he slept with that strange girl in our bed.  I lived with my friend Joe for about a week, then Justin and I made up and I moved back. What I mean by made up is that he told me he loved me. And I desperately wanted to be loved, so I went back to h
