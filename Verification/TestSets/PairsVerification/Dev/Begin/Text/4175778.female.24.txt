Everyday I have political discussions (arguments) with people. I love talking about politics. I like knowing what is important to someone, and I love to hear someone's rationale behind voting for a given candidate. That being said, I am tired of the discussion revolving around Iraq and terrorism. Don't get me wrong, I think these are VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES, but they are not the only issues. The fact is whoever is elected will continue our "War on Terror." We cannot afford to stand by while there are  credible  threats to our country. I think John Kerry will work to step up US intelligence agencies, and I also think he will seek (and receive) international help in the rebuilding of Iraq. I am convinced that Dubya will be no better at handling these situations.  The first paper I wrote in college was about ending permanent MFN trade status with China. There are numerous reasons I supported this, but the most important reason was the government's history of human rights violations against their own people. I thought (and I still do) that we needed to send a message to China that we would not deal with a government which was abusive to its citizens. I tell you this to highlight my opinion on Iraq. Saddam Hussein was an evil man. I would agree that the Iraqi citizens will be better off in the long run. I have NO problem with us being the world police. I support US intervention in situations of mass genocide or political tyranny. BUT, that's not why we went to Iraq. We went there for WMDs and to settle a score with the guy who tried to kill GW's daddy. I truly believe this, and I won't argue the points. The story obviously changed when it appeared we would not find large stockpiles of weapons. I think the world (and Iraq) is safer without Saddam, but I don't think he was the most glaring threat to US safety. Despite what G-Dub and Dick Cheney have said ("No, I didn't say that...er...go fuck yourself!"), there is no proven link between Saddam and those responsible for 9/11 ( urlLink 9/11 Commission Report  pgs 61 &amp; 66).  I try to think back to March 2003, and I don't recall doubting that Saddam may have WMDs. I do recall thinking that we had troops in Afghanistan (Isn't it something like 10,000 troops v. the 140,000 in Iraq???) looking for bin Laden who to date has not been found. I could not fathom starting another war while we still had troops fighting in another country. Is it good strategy to fight a war on two fronts? I never thought Saddam was a credible threat, and I think the majority of Americans now agree. At the time a lot of people disagreed with me about my opinions. The fact is I love this country. I am a proud American. I support our troops. Those are facts about myself, and they are not issues I will debate. GW says, "You're either with us or you're a
