Life as I see it...     Life as I see it, and would like others to see it... is not a destination but a journey, Life as I see it is much more than just fame, praise or money.  Life as I see it is the sunshine of hope even in the darkest hours, Life as I see it is beautiful even like a grave topped with flowers.  Life as I see it is happiness even when everything around is sad, Life as I see it is patience even if you're getting mad.  Life as I see it is forgiveness to even the biggest mistake, Life as I see it is giving even when you desperately need to take.  Life as I see it is smiling even at the toughest of times, Life as I see it is even in a storm, the sweet ringing of chimes.  Life as I see it is a small boat sailing even in the turbulent sea, Life as I see it is thanking and appreciating for friends and family.  Life as I see it is a bird with broken wings, who still dreams to fly, Life as I see it is maybe not always success, but never failing to try.  Life as I see it is only truth and nothing less, Life as I see it  is not perfectly arranged, but not also a total mess.  Life as I see it is accepting and learning not to complain, Life as I see it is silence, for others, even when you're in pain.  Life as I see it and would like others to see it... is a gift, given only once, Enjoy it, live it and use it for people to remember you always..even when death comes.         Tejas

Then upon one day, a young man, proud; Pondered at the old man, amidst the seeking crowd.  “I’ll prove him wrong!” the young man decided, Down the hill, into the forest, he ran excited.  His first glimpse caught a butterfly, delicate And he thought, looking at the creature small yet great…  “I’ll ask the old man, if it’s dead or living, And wait for the sage’s answering.  “If he answers, “alive it is” I‘ll carefully crush it to bits!  ““It is dead” shall he utter, I’ll release it and let it flutter!”  With this ingenious plan to make the old man falter, The young man rushed, butterfly in hand, to the rock shelter…  “Is it alive?”, he asked the old m
