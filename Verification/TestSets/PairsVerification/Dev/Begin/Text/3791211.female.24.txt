So last weekend I went to my second Pride Parade in Toronto.  Much fun was had with only a few minor disagreeable moments.  I left Kingston early Friday morning with my friend Dan and stayed in a really great hostel along Church St.  We even had a friendly hello from a girl staying in our room the first night and who proceeded to have sex with her girlfriend while I waited for Dan to get out of the washroom (there's only so much rustling I can do!).    Anyway, the first night Dan and I checked out a Carribean band playing at the South stage and sat down to watch the crowds, that is, until a crazy fat man with no shirt decided to sit beside me and sing at the top of his lungs . . . it was time to go.  Saturday was the Dyke March which was great, but why is it always the women who shouldn't be taking their shirts off who love to so much?  Another of life's mysteries.  I did sit next to a really cute lesbian couple with a three-year-old girl who was adorable.

As a little aside, Drag Queen's are just sooooo great, they make everything more fun, end of story.  There was also a really great Hedwig and the Angry Inch band playing but we had to choose and the drag show won out.    This brings us to Sunday, if ever there was a gay holy day this is it, a million people crammed themselves into a few blocks to watch half naked, all out naked, drag queens, and various other crazy costumed people parade down Yonge St. to dance music.  Props to the gay bagpipe band and the huge peacock dress which took three guys to pull it!  Hopefully I can find someone with a scanner and put a few pictures on here someday.  The parade was about two and half hours long and we had to line up outside the guardrails an hour earlier to secure a spot to see, so people started complaining their legs were sore and decided to walk the rest of the parade and sit down somewhere.  Dan decided he didn't want to and he'd meet me later at the drag stage again, but unfortunately due to one o
