Finally got around to doing a blog.  (Yippee !) Got motivated to doing it after seeing a policy-related blog this morning before a job interview and visiting a lot of network sites this evening:  urlLink Ryze ,  urlLink Tribe ,  urlLink Craig's List , and the other usual suspects.  I'm still too busy to research all of them out there.  One of these days I'll get to visit every site listed at  urlLink Social Software .  But by then something new will take over.....
Sure, I don't (b)log anything for a month and then I choose to change all of my settings, my layout and the functionality of the blog.  Hmmmm...let's see if this "blog by e-mail" functionality works.  (and if embedded links are as easy as they should be...)  OTN (Obligatory Technology Note):    *Web Hosting* - As someone owns a few domains, who doesn't want to pay a lot for hosting, and who wants CF hosting, I recommend   urlLink HostingDataCenter  .  (Get a reseller account !)  If you want to know more about the hosting field in general (e.g. experiences, tech issues, etc.) see  urlLink WebHostingTalk .
Joe here again.....(almost a month later !).  Here's some links I want to use to show you some of the work I've done:  My  urlLink Home Page    CSU's  urlLink IR Home Page   An  urlLink article  showing some of the characteristics of the CSU Cohort group (first-time, full time, degree-seeking freshman students)  A redesign of UA's IT Master's Program  urlLink web site   A  urlLink web site  for the BT50K, a 50K fun run that I founded ten years ago
Returned from the  urlLink AIR Conference  in Boston this week.  Presented my  urlLink demonstration  of Q Methodology and was able to attend quite a few other interesting sessions on retention, swirl, survey techniques and other IR topics.  (The day after returning another Continental flight from Cleveland to Boston received a military escort due to a mistaken transmission made by the pilot.)  Also had a chance to run and roam around the  urlLink Harvard  and  urlLink MIT  campuses and got to see the  urlLink Stata  building at MIT, designed by Frank Gehry.  Much larger in scope and size than the  urlLink Peter B. Lewis building  he designed for  urlLink Case .
From the too much time on my hands department......  Today I re-activated my  urlLink Yahoo Mail  account after reading about their service upgrade providing free access to a mailbox capable of storing 100 MB of messages.  This is, of course is in response to Google whose  urlLink Gmail  software was also recently launced.  GMail, OTOH, offers 1 GB of storage.  (Little did I know my Yahoo account was deactivated because (probably) of inactivity.)    I think I'm going to do a little experiment and see how fast the spam fills up in each of the boxes which were essentially created on the same day.  (Of course the Yahoo mailbox is older but I rarely gave the address to anyone.)  This experiment will measure the quality of each services spam-prevention software and compare the messages that get through to each.  P
