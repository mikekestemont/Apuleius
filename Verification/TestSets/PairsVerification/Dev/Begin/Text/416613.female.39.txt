OK here's my contribution.....   The Three Texans   Three Texas surgeons were talking.... One of them said, "I'm the best    surgeon in Texas. A concert pianist lost 7 fingers in an accident, I    reattached them, and 8 months later he performed a private concert for    the Queen of England."   One of the others said. "That's nothing. A young man lost both arms and   legs in an automobile accident outside Houston, I reattached them, and 2 years  later he won a gold medal in field events in the Olympics."   The third surgeon said, "You guys are amateurs. Several years ago a  cowboy who was high on cocaine and alcohol rode a horse head-on   into a train traveling 80 miles an hour. All I had left to work with    was the horse's ass, a pile of horseshit and a cowboy hat.   Now he's president of the United States."    and on the other side......   This test only has one question, but it's a very important one.  Please don't answer it without giving it some very serious thought.  By giving an honest answer you will be able to test where you stand morally.  The test features an unlikely, completely fictional situation, where you will have to make a decision one way or the other.   Remember that your answer needs to be honest, yet spontaneous.  Please read slowly and consider each line - this is important for the test to work accurately.   YOUR TEST: You're in Florida . . . In Miami, to be exact. There is great chaos going on around you, caused by a hurricane and severe floods.  . . .   There are huge masses of water all over you. . . . You are a Newsweek photographer and you are in the middle of this great disaster. The situation is nearly hopeless.   You're trying to shoot very impressive photos. There are houses and people floating around you, disappearing into the water. Nature is showing all its destroying power and is ripping everything away with it.   You see a man in the water; he is fighting for his life, trying not to be taken away by the masses of water and mud. You move closer. Somehow the man looks familiar.   Suddenly you know who it is - it's John Kerry! At the same time you notice that the raging waters are about to take him away, forever.  You have two options. You can save him... Or, you can take the best photo of your life.  So you can save the life of John Kerry, or you can shoot a Pulitzer Prize winning photo --- a unique photo displaying the death of one of the country's most "powerful" men.   And so, here's the question... Please be honest...   Would you select color film, or rather go with the simplicity of classic black and white?     See..a little something for all of us.  I'm so not in everyone's league at this blog so, I'll resume the role as comic relief.  Like it or not I do have the right to post here.  giggle giggle.
Man Kerry goes sking and l
