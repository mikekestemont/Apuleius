Yeah, So I am at my moms work. BORING. But hey what can ya do.    I have work till 10 tonight. Then get up tomorrow and go and get off at 4. Then KRUM BUMS. I need new jeans. Think I might get some tomorrow after work. I get to see Brandon, Syd and Erica tomorrow.    I finally talk to Amber. She's said alot of stuff has happend since we haven't talked in like forever. Wonder what's been going on.
So I am feeling better about myself all of a sudden. I made a list of things I need to do to be a better person.     Things I need to do:   1. Be cool with everybody   2. Listen to people more   3. Chage alot (I'm still a bitch)   4. Live life to the fullest   5. Don't care so much   6. Give some people their space   7. Keep in touch with friends. Don't drift so far apart.   8. Look up to my role model more   9. Be myself !   10. Stay close with my close friends.    &nbsp;  Yep. That's the list. Pretty lame huh? Yeah, you know I rock. * giggle*
So I think I am starting to look up to someone. Every time I read something she writes I wish I could be like that. Maybe I wouldn't be the way I am.  &nbsp;  I'm starting to get a pain in my stomach. Like somethings going to happen. But what could happen.  &nbsp;  I want to go do something. But I don't know what.&nbsp; I wanna go buy something. Or just something.     &nbsp;
So I haven't written in here in a while.   Everythings back to normal I think..   Krum bums a
