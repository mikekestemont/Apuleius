I met Joana on April, 13th 2001 on the IM chat. It was the time when I freshly moved to new city and my life was just occurring notable changes. I felt excited and full of enthusiasm, with big plans in my head drown into work. Optimism and good, fun mood was the typical sign of myself those times even more specially than usually. Joana came into my way as a person very much alike me – she was fun, self-confident, she had worked out opinions and mainly, she was crowded by life which was shooting and leaking out of her the way I could have felt the wetness on my hands. That was my first impression of her – the crazy and talkative girl, who likes to have people around, who talks to anyone, is not afraid and shy at all, who is aware of her capabilities and modesty isn’t her strong side. It was what caught my interest on her and didn’t let me forget her.       Even if this “first-impression Joana” was very interesting and magnetic to me, with the time flowing and us two getting closer to each other, I was slowly starting to be concerned about such a person. I, deep in my essence, was quite a sensitive person, reacting to details, getting affected by many things. And she felt sometimes too cool (super), and out of it too cold, too strong for me. I wasn’t much like her and this difference felt unpleasant on me many times.      Now I know this girl, Joana, for more than three years already. We have not spent them body near body, but I can say we have spent them very intensively and with a tight contact. We have maybe been together more than normal couples, who share the same bed. It was a good opportunity to get to know Joana in details, deep into her soul and real, true way she is. Adding the 75 intensive days, spent together 24 hours daily, I can say I have quite a precise idea about my girl. During all this time my knowledge of Joana has been constantly updated. My Joana was getting developed from the “first-impression Joana” to the real Joana from the perspective of my mind. Development was long, complex and very detailed. As detailed and complex as the personality along with the relationship of a person can only be. During all this time miracles were happening. It was because slowly, step by step, Joana was converging from a “fun-to-talk girl” “first-impression Joana” to “ideal-girl-to-live-with” real Joana. Besides few things, each detail that showed a more real Joana was nice to me. Each simple new piece of knowledge that I have discovered made me wonder and say “God, I like this girl”. And so it led to final discovery, that Joana was exactly the girl that perfectly fits myself and that I appreciate for she is very much like me. And that is ideal. If there is something not so fine or weird she does, I just stop and smile
