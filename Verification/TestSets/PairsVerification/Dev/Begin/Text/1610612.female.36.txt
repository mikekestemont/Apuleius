Enough with the sap already. I know that anyone besides my best friend reading that would fall asleep. hahahah Oh well, fuck off its still how I feel. Oh Lord, what is wrong with everyone?  I have a rule that I do not trust anyone who reveals too much of their personal lives in  a short time. Example: i am working with someone, and have known them a week. I now know; her husband cheated on her and left her, she relinquished custody of her daughter when she was 1 year old, she does not have her son with her, she tends to drink too much and smokes weed. I also seems she is a little boy crazy and in search of some sort of emotional/sexual validation. Oh, did I mention she actually works for me? I am her fucking boss! Stop, I dont care. Now, I am a very caring person, but get a magazine rack over here, this girl has issues spilling out of her ass.    She needs emotional depends.   Fuck I am tired of people thinking they can tell me all their shit. If I wanted to hear all this, I wouldve become a therapist. But, alas, I am not.   Not like I am so together, or have not had my share of stuff, but my goddess this is too much. I am past all the drama. I dont want it any more, I want my quiet little life. Everyone assumes I want to hang out with them. I am a little too old, and have so many other interests, none of which include looking at the faces of the people I am forced to spend  40 hrs a week with.  Advice to people who want to "share" with anyone they meet :  They dont really care, they are being nice to you to get you to go away. Save up your money and get a shrink, and tell them your shit.   Wow how deliciously bitchy. Ok , I just wanted to say deliciously. I had the most curious dream this morning when I took a nap. I dreamed my husband was cheating on me with other men. He is fiercly hetero, so it was weird. Even weirder was all I could think in the dream was " Oh well, I cant compete with that". In the dream I was actually resigned to the fact that I could never give a man the same pleasure as someone who "owned the equipment". hahahahhaha
Now here is my secret, very simply secret: you can only see things clearly with your heart. What is essential is invisible to the eye  .     aaah, the Little Prince.  I was with my baby at our neighborhoods "toddler time", when all the little ones play together. We were right outside the gym. I thought how sad it was that instead of running outside and playing like little children, they were miserable and running on the indoor tracks.  I have had alot of little epiphanies like that since I had my son. I know it sounds t
