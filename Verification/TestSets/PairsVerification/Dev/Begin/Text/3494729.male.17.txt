i don't know where to go now  i'd move on but i don't know how  everytime i head down this road  i end up in this place with-  no east no west no foward no back  just an empty lonely space  just an empty lonely space   and i'm standing here, waiting here  won't you open your blind eyes  I'm standing here, waiting here  can't you see through my disguise  i'm standing here waiting here  waiting for you  standing right in front of you   you've been here a time or two  and i just smile and i just nod  and though i seem, i seem to be calm  i don't know what to do  i'm too afraid to take a step  and change the role the role i play  and though i know i'll never know  i wonder anyway   and i'm standing here, waiting here  won't you open your blind eyes  I'm standing here, waiting here  please see through my disguise  i'm standing here waiting here waiting for you  standing right in front of you   i doubt you'll ever understand  i doubt you'll ever, ever know  i doubt i'll ever give you the chance  t
