It is so cool to watch a baby discover the world. Quinn laughed for the first time on July 4th. My Dad was being goofy and waving a towel at her and for some reason she found it humorous. The silly thing then cried a few seconds later when Dad put the towel over her head for a second to do peek-a-boo!  &nbsp; She changes so much week by week. Her hand-eye coordination is starting to develop and it is so neat to watch her reach for things and actually touch them! Next thing I know she will be picking up everything in sight. She has been working on rolling over as well. I think she could do it if she just put a little more ooomph behind it, but so far she just hasn't pushed herself over! &nbsp; She was so good in nursery at church today. I was relieved because last time she was in nursery she cried half the time she was there... and I mean screamed. I think the fact that she had two good naps BEFORE church made a big difference. I think I finally might have found a happy medium. If i can get her to take two naps before church then she is "napped up" and ready to go for a few hours. We even went out to eat afterwards. We fed her a bottle and then she took a catnap.  &nbsp; She is mellowing out quite a bit now. I still notice a difference if she doesn't get her Zantac dose or if she spits half of it out. I wonder what she would have been like as a newborn if it hadn't been for the acid reflux? I'm just grateful that she didn't end up in the hospital or anything. Some babies quit eating or throw up so much that they don't get enough to eat.  &nbsp; There is a part of me that is looking forward to her becoming mobile... rolling, crawling, walking... but on the otherhand I also know that the older she gets the stronger her "will" is going to get. Both Bryan and I are convinced that we are going to have a strong-willed child on our hands. I suppose time will tell!!
My husband is a tool.
A few years ago, I hosted a lock-in for the girls in the youth group. Sometime near the god-awful hour of 4 in the morning one of the teens and I were enjoying the peace and quiet after the rest of the girls were out. She asked me what my dreams were. Funny question, I thought. I was graduated from college, had a job I enjoyed, was married to a guy I loved, and in general felt pretty much at peace with my place in the world. Dreams? In some ways, all of things things that teenagers dream of had already happened to me. Had I forogotten to continue dreaming? Well, I replied to this girl, of course I dream of having children... but that is a given for most women I
