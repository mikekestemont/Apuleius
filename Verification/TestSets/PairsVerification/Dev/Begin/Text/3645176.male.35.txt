"This is an interesting exchange."  It is absolutely ignorant to state that one who does not speak "Spanish" is cannot claim to be Hispanic. There have been Hispanics in the present area of the United States of America (Santa Fe, Los Angeles, Albuquerque, etc...) whose ancestors have been here for over four hundred years.   Another point to make is that if an African-American does not speak "African", then do you not consider them to be a minority or African-American? Would you disqualify them from a minority based scholarship if they did not speak any of the languages from the continent of Africa? No, and to be quite honest it would be very unethnical. So, to get to the point, it is wrong to condemn Hispanics because they do not speak Spanish and it is wrong to make the statements that you made about their not being a minority.  Posted by: J.

Smith,  You said, "...if an African-American does not speak "African," then do you not consider them to be a minority or African-American?"  How does one speak African? I did not know that there was such a language?  You have a lot to learn before you speak on this subject. That is evident in your use of the term "African-American." Can you tell me what an "African-American" is?  Daniel  Posted by: Daniel E. Smith on May 26, 2004 03:10 PM   urlLink Go here to see the entire list of postings

Box 942849 Sacramento, California 94249-0035  Dear Assembly Member Jackson:  Governor Elect, Arnold Schwarzenegger plans to reverse the legislation Gray Davis signed regarding the granting of California drivers’ licenses to undocumented immigrants. I was troubled to read in the October 9th, 2003 edition of the Ventura County Star that there was little sentiment in the legislature to go along with his plan.  I do not agree with the arguments put forth by the supporters of the drivers’ license for illegal immigrants. I believe that Governor Davis felt much the same way, even as he signed this “give away” legislation into law. He was counting on support in return for rewarding those who would circumvent our laws…as we now know, he was wrong.  As a world traveler, I can make my point with a few examples. First, I was driving in Belize with nothing more that my California drivers’ license, my passport and my visa. I was stopped at a checkpoint where I was asked for my ID. I gave the officer my drivers’ license and my passport and I was sent on my way. In addition, I have traveled to, and driven in, Mexico with nothing more than my California drivers’ license. The point of these examples is that, they knew who I was, why I was in their country and how long I would be staying.  If we cannot answer with certainty who someone is, where they are from, w
