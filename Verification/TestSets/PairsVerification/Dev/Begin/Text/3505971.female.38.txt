Tiffani and I are talking on the phone, pondering our first post. Pondering is hindered by several factors:  1)  Both of us are hungover.  Since much of our pondering is done drunk or hungover, this should not be an issue. Moving on to 2) It's early afternoon, and both of us are scummy from last night's drinking (in separate cities), from too much morning coffee, and from too many morning  cigarettes. Because this is standard morning-into-afternoon pondering  state, this should not be an issue.  Moving on then to 3) It's Memorial Day--gorgeous in one city, gloomy in another--and both of us should be  either writing (journal articles, not a joint blog post) or "enjoying  the holiday."  Since we now seem to be pondering why we can't ponder,  we accept a non-pondering ponder position.  Perhaps we should say a bit about how this blog came about.  Candi:  Hey Tiff.  Why did we decide to start this blog? Tiffani: Well, I seem to think that the idea came to me when I was in  town last week.  I was still drunk from the night before, and I was reading academic blogs.  I just didn't feel that they spoke to our concerns. Candi:  Do we have--or what we have, can it be called--concerns? Tiffani:  Perhaps "concerns" is too strong a word.  I feel like our dialogue is stilted, man. Candi:  Yeah. Blogging dialogue sucks. Tiffani:  Whatever.  What are we going to do here? Candi:  Talk about the breakdown in the system. Tiffani:  Yeah.  How do we explain "the system"? Candi:  Well, the system is huge, bigger than we know.  Right now, our flash of insight into the system has to do with condoms. Tiffani: Condoms. Candi:  They won't use them. Tiffani: It used to be so seamless. Candi: All it used to take was, "Do you have something?" Tiffani: That was it. Then there was protected fucking,  with no discussion. Candi: I think the breakdown in the system occurred some time around Y2K. Y2K, turns out, was not about the worldwide breakdown of computer systems.  It was about cum, unrestrained cum. Tiffani: Yeah, man, Y2K = why would you use a condom? Candi: A post-Y2K world, man, semen everywhere, just never in a condom. Tiffani:  Yeah, there was semen everywhere, but mainly inside of me,  on Saturday morning. Candi:  Yeah, my on-the-rebound-from-someone-else ex-boyfriend decided on the "pull-out method" with me on Wednesday night.  This is not a birth-control method. Tiffani: It, like the "rhythm method," is fully endorsed by Pope John Paul II.   Do you think that the popularity of _The Da Vinci Code_ and _The Passion of  the Christ_ has anything to do with the breakdown? Candi:  The system has been affected by those texts, I am sure. Tiffani: I don't think most of the boys I fuck can read. Candi:  Even Saturday-morning guy? Tiffani: He has a Ph.D. in Rhetoric & Composition but not a book in that house.  So there's a little taste. We love you all very much [another part of the blog will contain a bit on inappropriate s
