I've come to some recent conclusions about my life that make me kind of sad.  There have really only been two girls I've ever thought about asking out on a date, but through my hesitation, I've lost my opportunities for such actions.  In both cases, my losses of chance have been due to their status change from single to unavailable, shall we say.  I can't win this battle.  One might suggest that I should try to snake either of the girls away from the respective boyfriends using superior intelligence, height, or funniness, or something like that.  All of those options are out of the question; the one girl who went to GACS graduated this year, she'll be goin to Presbyterian next year, her boyfriend is funny as hell, 6'5", and captain of the varsity basketball team at GACS.  Outsmarting him could happen, but only if I wanted serious physical abuse from him and his team of rapists.  The other girl goes to school with me, she'll be a senior with me next year.  This case is tougher than the other because in the latter scenario, her and her boyfriend will at least be separated.  This one doesn't work like that since he also goes to school with her.  Size doesn't work, he's just as tall as me.  Hes at least as smart as  me, but chances are that he could have his way with me in a battle of wits.  He's kinda serious, but tells some really good jokes when he does let out the funny.  The primary problem with the second case is that this boyfriend isn't just some fool I don't know.  He's a pretty good friend, and it's just not cool to split up friends' relationships.  It's also a classic case of basic competition and PR.  Either I steal the girl, say fuck the other guy, lose a friend, and potentially develop a reputation for backstabbing, or I leave it alone, keep everyone else happy, and torture myself with having to watch from a distance the girl that I long for.  Fuckin a.   On the brighter side,  urlLink read this  if you want a laugh.
I've decided what going to happen after high school.  I'm going straight to Georgia Tech where I'm dual majoring in either nuclear or aerospace engineering and business.  From there, a job opening will immediately find me and I'll live in some huge city;  NYC, LA, Tokyo, a place like that. (EDIT: I've found an even better city, Monte Carlo)  The night life will rock serious ass.  I'll have a bunch of cars, namely  urlLink this one  for my various racing needs and  urlLink this one  for my crazy parties!  It's all gonna work out because all my high school and college friends will live in the same city and we'll party al of the time, because each of us made some breakthrough discovery or invention that made them TONS of money.    My breakthrough/invention is to design a compact fusion reactor that generates such ridiculous amounts of power for its size and the amount o
