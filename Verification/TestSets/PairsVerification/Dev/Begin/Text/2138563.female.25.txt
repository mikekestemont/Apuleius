well, the first night on my new job was great.  pretty busy, but the other girls said it wasn't busy compared to what tonight will be.  i guess i'll find out in a couple of hours.  my knee hurts, though.  i think i hyper-extended it in yoga the other night and all the walking last night must have irritated it more.  being the hiker that i am, you wouldn't think i could hyper-extend my knee, but i guess i can.  i'm pretty sure anyone can.  i think it will be okay, it's just a little tender.  i know that i need better shoes for one thing.  i can't wear tennis shoes at my restaraunt job and all the non-tennis shoes i have are not made for extended periods of time on my feet.  hopefully next week i can get some more supportive shoes.  anyways, i've got to get busy cleaning the office b/c i'm off to mom's for the weekend.  hoping to find some solace and relaxation on the lake and in the country.  i'll be back on tuesday, so don't expect an update until then.  have a good weekend.  peace & love.
okay.  i'm starting this thing all over again.  when you haven't written anything for two months, there's no way to catch up.  i figured i may as well just start from today and go from there.  i put up a picture of me and my dog dylan.  it's not a new picture and it's not the most attractive picture of either one of us, but it's the only one i have of us right now.  it's from last year on day two, "the jorney home", of our big backpacking adventure.  my friend marci, the dog and i all went on a five mile hike into the middle of the ozark national forest.  we were on the ozark highland trail and it was so beautiful!  five miles was a lot at that time because neither one of us had been on an overnight backpacking trip before.  since then i have not been on any more overnight journeys, but i have been on many day trips from four to six miles.  i haven't had much time for hiking lately.  i have been busy in the pits of depression.  thankfully i am over that now and am a better person for the time i spent in that ugly place.  it wasn't fun, but it was necessary for me to move on with my life.  i'm sure you can all relate.  now i have dedicated my weekends to working.  yes, more working.  i already have an mon thru fri, 8 to 5 job and two cleaning jobs (each one day a week), but that still does not support my overspending habits.  i have now destroyed my credit cards and have taken on another job to pay the price for bad money management.  i am going to be a hostess at a local fancy restraunt on thurs, fri and sat nights.  so much for fun on the weekends.  but it will be worth i
