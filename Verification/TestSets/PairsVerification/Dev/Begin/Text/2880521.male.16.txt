Hmmm... a while since i updated this blog. So here i am, providing you on the latest update. Haha  Last week was a mess. I can't remember what happened for the week. I know i went to school, came back home, take a nap, do homework and sleep. Boring ya? This is my life. Haha.  The earlier part of last week was boring. So boring i almost bored to death. Haha. But on thursday, it was a day i would never forget. When i reached school that day, i was shocked. My class was missing by more than half! Only 8 people, including me, turned up. It turned out that the others had went on a "class outing" to Jurong East Entertainment Centre. Well, it was actually not something new, considering that there was once where 13 people skip school to go to some Polytechnic Open House. Anyway, I remember the school was speculating that the "O" level results would be released on Friday(20th Feb). So in view of this, the class chairman suggested going out to play so as to enjoy the last bit of "freedom" we had, of course at the expense of school. Most went and had fun, with the exception of 8 poor souls who has integrity and insisted on coming to school. But it turned out the school was wrong and the results are not even released yet up till now. So they face some disciplinary problems which i shall not elaborate here. Haha. School on that day was rather slack. Come on, the teacher see our class size and he lost all mood to teach. Lolz. After school, i went to meet up with one of my secondary school friend and we went to city area to walk walk look look. Haha. It was rather rewarding as i finally lay my hands on the game i was looking badly for. Finally, it has returned to me! Wahahaha...oops...sorry. Hmmm...what a interesting thursday.  Friday...the starting of slacking! Haha. Chemistry Practical lesson was one boring lesson, doing titration again. Haiz! Titration for three consecutive weeks? I am so sick of it now. However, after the school break the school decided to let us have a taste of Orientation days again. Hooray! No lessons! Not only that, i also get to meet up with friends in my Orientation Group and Family. F4 ROX! Haha. We had some interaction, OG and Family time, a buffet lunch courtesy of the school and not forgetting mass dances! Haha. Everyone had great fun and it was a emotional moment when everything has ended and everyone has to part. After all, all good things has to come to a end. Everyone just could not forgot the friendship forged during Orientation days and i am sure it wil last on and on. But look on the bright side! We will have plenty of chances to see each other again, be it in school or anywhere in Singapore. At least this is what I told myself. Haha. 5.30 pm and i was back in school. N
