Damn damn damn fuck fuck fuck! o my arrghh im am mad! this is the offical first vent on this site. they have me working on friday night when that was the one day i requested off! but nooooo i have to work and only 2 people could have taken my shift and one cant and i doubt the other can either!!! so mad i hate working! work sucks. if u dont already have a job dont get one they suck except for every few days a month when u get paid those are the only good days! ok i think i might be ok now.
yea so i cleaned my room again...went to work again...came home and had a quickie at the jacuzzi :) and that was the extent of my funfilled day! o my gosh! but yea anyhow PSA- For everyone that doesnt already know Erin is PORN! Jessica is a BITCH! and i am well we havnt decided yet but im sure we will find something but for now im just mads. yea i am one exciting person i know and sometimes you can't handle it but one day i will have u all trained to be my lil uhm poodles or something...whats this i here about multiply thumbs up on PCH that i missed chloe! damn i feel so unloved lemme just say.  REMINDER~The Club has a singles meeting on sat night u better be there or be square...or something-much love and happiness  P.S-I have the cd jess! TOXIC
