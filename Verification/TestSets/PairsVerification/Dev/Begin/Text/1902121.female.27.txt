Man, the people at Old Navy really need to start beating the sweat market laborerers that make their clothes a little bit harder. The quality of clothing there is such shit.   Ahhh, that's right ladies and gentlemen I'm back. I had to delete the old blog for reasons I won't get into here. I was debating on whether to start another one or not, thinking that maybe my blogging days were behind me. But I couldn't stay away. That, and apparently my friends (my loyal fans) really enjoyed the voyeuristic glimpse inside my brain. Scumbags.   So here's the new and improved blog. Henceforth I shall be known on the internet as "Nuggets". I'll ask that if you want to link to me you use my pen name Nuggets or whatever name you want, as long as it's not something people can google and find me with. Ok, that's all for now.
That fucking joke. Obviously made by some fucking asshole failure who "quit" smoking two weeks ago, but just came back from his mid-morning cigarette break. So yeah, in case you couldn’t tell by my sunny disposition, I’m trying to quit. I am down to only smoking when I drink – which is proving to be the hardest part to give up.

I was hoping that by making this post it’d help with the frustration. But like those stupid anti-smoking commercials they show on TV, it’s only making me want to go smoke one that much more. HELP!!
Just wanted to congratulate my favorite local bar,  urlLink the Tir Na Nog , for being voted the best neighborhood bar in Somerville by the Improper Bostonian. I love you guys way more than I should. See you tonight.     Thanks to my friend JBar for pointing out to me that my local bar won such an award. I guess I drink too much to ever notice that kind of thing myself.

I’ve had so many people tell me that I’m too pessimistic: friends, boyfriends, ex-boyfriends, family members, strangers, old people, the list goes on. But recently I realized that I’m not pessimistic – that I, in fact, am the definition of an optimist… provided you redefine what it means to be an optimist slightly.   Case in point: my friend Marso and I were recently discussing a news story about a man who went into a Romanian doctor’s office for some routine testicle surgery and came out with his penis sliced into three pieces ( urlLink I'm not kidding ). Marso, being a man, was horrified. I quickly pointed out that this might actually turn out good for the man. Perhaps he will have his penis sewn back together (and on), and he’ll begin his new career as a porn star, a la John Wayne Bobbit (Optimistic Viewpoint N
