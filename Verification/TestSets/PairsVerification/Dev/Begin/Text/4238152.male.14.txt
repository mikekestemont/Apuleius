Musings At Anderson By: Nofing  Of late, I’ve come to notice how seriously the school values their student’s opinions. This is especially so for the less positive, less pleasant and well, cruder remarks. Not that I’ve failed to notice over my past three years at Anderson but what Mr. Ang mentioned just recently made me sit up and wonder what really is their problem or our problem? In school, there are only two sorts of bright sparks – those at 3/7 and those at 3/1. Those in between are just  in – betweens . See, those at 3/7 are nice, respectable students who do their work and keep to themselves. Those at the other side of the rainbow however, are a darker shade of  black . They are bright no doubt and self – opinioned. They are the people PM Lee wants (don’t wait to be invited to tea instead take the…). Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for our brethren Dr. Chee Soon Juan. Ironically the situation is also the same at Anderson. However, the issue Mr. Ang raised was of similar nature. A secondary 2 student had been voicing his strong opinions on his online blog. Not that I am praising him but certainly there must be room for creativity and self – reflection? Of course, the nature and content of his online entries must be taken into consideration. To what extent was it crude and slanderous, which at the same time is very unbecoming of Andersonians. Certainly voicing out one’s feelings isn’t wrong or else esteemed writers like Mr. Humphrey and Mr. Brown would have been taken to task? However, cracking blue jokes and touching on controversial issues like what an extremely unwise Sheikh Haikel did would get you into unwanted trouble. As much as I wish to contend with the fact that airing one’s opinions is perfectly fine as long as one toes the line, it is disappointing to note that Mr. Ang also found usage of vulgarities and dialects of unprintable nature hard to swallow. I am one would enjoys the beauty of languages. The less refined bits are part and parcel of it not that it is encouraged but like the finer points of any language, it allows for better expression. I feel that instead of condemning these words and phrases alike, we must learn to accept them and realize that at times, it is that special word that bridges the gap. Of course, Mr. Ang’s cause for concern is understandable. Singaporeans are a refined lot like their British counter – parts where the f word is used without so much as a bat of the eyelid. Dialects are an art. They represent our forefather’s culture. Their way of life, which at that time was tough – going, and their manner of speech was likewise influenced. Many a time, I find it strange that people take pleasure in back – biting others. I do not stand for that. Instead, we must take pride in our words and actions. Others should not determine our lives; n
