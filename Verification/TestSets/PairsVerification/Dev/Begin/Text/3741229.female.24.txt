Well, this weekend "no pare la pata" like we say in spanish.  My mom calls me on Friday after work that she's coming down on Saturday to continue looking for a place.  Then, it was so hot that Redny and I went to the pool after I rode around with her for about 3 hours.  I got to see my princess Brandy. She got so happy to see me. My mom loved my place.  Damn, I'm skipping occurrences of my Saturday day. I'm that tired!    Then Sunday we rode to the Keys, again! Every single weekend we are over there! So we went to "La Playita".  It's a hidden small beach down passing Isla Morada that Monique and Javier found or something like hat and they did Bar-B-Q and we went for a while. I wanted to go to the tikki bar for a rum runner but my husband decided to go fishing.  No luck.  We then saw 2 sting rays, I mean HUGE, and apparently were fighting or mating because they were riding around in circles.  But, no fishes.  We left at 7:30 and caught some bad traffic going home.  It took us about 4 hours to get home due to a serious collision involving 6 vehicles; one being an Altima just like mine.  Man, I got nervous because just like my 2 accidents, which I'm glad to say were none of my fault, the altimas get hurt bad.  Funny! Capturing moments of my tragic frieking accidents, I remember my first one that the old lady took the red light and struck me from my right passenger and her brand new fold explorer was perfectly fine.  No dents! I think I should buy an S.U.V in the future.  But since I guess her husband told her over the phone to become a drama queen, she pretended to have pains on her knees.  But, unfortunetly, the b*tch got the ticket.  And this one of May 20, the stupid 19 year old, driving w/o a license (wtf are these kids doing in the street?) whom's friend looked just like Sonic The Hedgehog, decided to think his 20-second piece of crap Honda Civic, can make the left turn before I get there, and threw himself in front of me. I mean, Insurance adjusters, at the least the one covering for him, mind you, we both have Statefarm.  Until she received my accident report, like 2 weeks later, she wanted to declare me 40% liable.  I'm like 'B*tch!"...well, I didn't call her by that particular name that described her character but I did tell her that wtf did she want me to do other than stop because, you know, it's kind of what comes to mind when someone does something like this.  She told me I could've swerved to the left to avoid the accident.  I'm like WHAT??? Riggggghhttt!! If I would've swerved to the left, I would've hit the incoming cars, therefor, causing myself to be at fault (For Real!) and having them file a suit against me and Sonic and his o
