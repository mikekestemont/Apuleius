Nothing can heat up quite as much debate in religious circles as new medical breakthroughs—be they in the creation (cloning) or ending of life (abortion, euthanasia), or anywhere in between. So when Life published a special issue focusing on 21 breakthroughs in medical science for the 21st century, we knew we had to review these with a focus on how they would affect religious faith. All of these are now in existence under clinical trials which could be complete around the middle of the next century.   1. Memory drugs. Scientists have discovered a method for manipulating the gene responsible in part for long-term memory. They’ve been able to give fruit flies a photographic memory, and are hard at work on a drug for humans based on this discovery.   2. Attacking schizophrenia. E. Fuller Torrey has developed a ‘brain bank’ of more than 100 brains from schizophrenic and manic-depressives. Samples are being studied by groups around the world searching for the cause of the schizophrenia. Some are hunting for genetic clues, others for traces of a virus or a faulty neurotransmitter.    3. Edible vaccines. Researchers have developed a method for infusing potatoes with a vaccination for traveler’s diarrhea. The potatoes become living, low-cost vaccine factories, but because they contain no virulent agents they can’t cause an infection. This could become a low-cost way of delivering vaccines to the Third World.   4. Treating age-related blindness. Researchers have developed a new method for treating severe age-related macular degeneration (blindness in old age) by a two-step process involving a light-sensitive drug and very cool laser beams. This process is less dangerous than the previous one using ‘hot’ laser beams.   5. Blocking angiogenesis. Tumors are fueled by their ability to spark the construction of new blood vessels (angiogenesis). A new antiangiogenetic therapy halts this process, causing tumors to practically melt away. In a few years this could represent a cure for cancer, but it has further applications with more than 75 other diseases, including coronary artery disease, strokes, and AIDS.   6. The Smart Shirt. Scientists have developed a smart T-shirt with embedded sensors (like electrocardiograms to monitor the heart) which can transmit their signals to a satellite and thence to any location on Earth. These are useful for monitoring at home patients, police officers, athletes, or soldiers on a battlefield.   7. Herceptin therapy. Traditional cancer therapy is to throw as much poison into the body and hope it doesn’t kill good cells as well as bad ones. Herceptin is a ‘smart bomb’: it directly attacks the message system used to tell cancer cells to replicate wildly, and has few side effects. It’s been successful with some breast cancers.   8. Artificial retina. An implantable computer chip translates image information from a camera mounted on an eyeglass frame into electrical impulses which it passes through the retina to the brain. Early test patients have been able to detect motion and shapes. Others are working on a hybrid electronic-biological artificial retina.   9. Gene therapy. Scientists are using ‘suicide genes’ to attack glioblastoma, a fatal brain tumor. A modified l
