21/07/2004…today is my interview day with the college principal…. I was very much scared at the beginning but it all just went fine…………. The undergraduate program of the college will commence on 28/07/2004. I have never ever experienced a college life because I did not study the 11th and 12th classes in a college like my father did. I wait for the big day like all new comers to the college with a lot of fear in my mind………..
I am lucky to have a friend like Shashwath. Today 20/7/2004. He helped me to get my eligibility certificates form the university of Kerala……….he really care for me. He treats me as his brother. Thank you god for giving me such good friends&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
Today my dad has ordered a new car. The test drive car came to my house today I was very much happy to see it. The test driver took me to a drive in that car too. Now we have three car an Omni Van (MUV), Mercedes Benz E class, and now the new car Skoda Octavia L&amp;K, it cost around 15 lakhs………I am very much excited to see it….the new car will come shortly after the next month..
From today onwards I am going to write down all what is going to happen to my life from this instant…before that I would like you to tell you about some other things too.. I passed out from 10th standard from infant Jesus Anglo Indian higher secondary school with 67.5% and I joined there itself for my +2 and I graduated from there with 73.25% in my ISC Examination……… Initially I decided to join in Christ College, Banglore but then due to my low mark I was refused admission but then it would have been possible for me to get into that college if I entered into a twinning program…but that too due to lack of my luck or because of some other matters I decided not to join there………….Thinking that I could easily get into some colleges in my home town itself I completely threw away “my study home away plan” but here too I was struck with bad luck. I submitted my applications to two of the main colleges in Kollam Fathima National college and Sree Narayana college………. I was not at all in the merit list of Fathima college (might be because we did not have Business studies as some of my friends said or because of my bad luck) but I made it in the list of the SN college I was ranked the 127th…oh god after all of that high standard English with Good accent, Un comparable standard in accounts when compared with state syllabus and the learning of Management theories in commerce which are taught in undergraduate level or even in the post graduate level and excellent know how in economic working of the country …………all what I get is 127th rank……….
