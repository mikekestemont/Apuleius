So it's all gearing up now. In (almost) precisely two weeks, at 11am, it's my wedding!  It seems hard to believe, even this close, that it's actually going to happen.   Everyone's getting excited now - my mother-in-law to be is frantic as she's got nothing to wear, and it's all steaming ahead nicely.  Anyway, I thought I'd post my speech on here. It outlines nicely how I'm feeling about the whole thing, and anyway, the missus won't bother reading it (I hope)!   Opening   Distinguished guests, mother, mother-in-law, brothers and sisters-in-law, nephews, nieces, cousins, friends old and new, the unwashed, the unemployed and the unemployable  . .  Ladies and gentlemen bearing in mind that public speaking is a waste of valuable  drinking time, the bars open, and a good few of you are well  renowned for liking your pop, I'm sure I will endear myself to you all by keeping  this speech brief.  My wife and I would like to thank you all for being here and sharing in the best day of our lives. To have so many of you here to help us celebrate makes this day even more special – if that were possible. I’ll try and avoid the usual Groom’s Speech clichés – well, Lou told me to avoid the usual Groom’s Speech clichés – but if the odd one slips in, I hope you’ll forgive me!   Gerald and Carol  My thanks go to Gerald and Carol for making this day possible and for being much nicer in-laws than I ever expected to have – or, for that matter, than I really deserve!  The warm and friendly way they’ve treated me has made me feel welcomed into the family, and without their friendship and support, none of us would be here today – and if it wasn’t for Gerald, our bathroom still wouldn’t be tiled!   I have to thank them both for bringing up such a beautiful and intelligent daughter. Louise is a lovely person. She deserves a good husband.   So I thought I’d best marry her before she found one.   My Parents  I would also like to thank my parents, and I’m so pleased that they and my grandmother could be here tonight – if only to verify with their own eyes that I’ve finally done the deed!.   Mum and Dad have always loved and supported me through every stage of my life, particularly through the irresponsible stage that seemed to last well into my twenties, and which Louise may argue hasn’t ended yet.   So thanks Mum and Dad for all your incredible love and support over many years and for instilling in me, whatever it is that convinced Louise that she wanted to marry me. On that score alone, you should be justifiably proud of yourselves, I am certainly proud to have you as my parents.   Best Man  I'd like to thank Mitch for agreeing to be my Best Man.  Admittedly he was drunk when I asked him, but by the next day it was too late to wriggle out of it!  Mitch and I h
