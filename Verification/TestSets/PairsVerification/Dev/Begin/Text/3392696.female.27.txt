I am really so naughty...but in a nice way. Guilty of the former coz I skipped work to spend some quiet and intimate time with my partner. It was nice which I'm guilty as I'm charged. We slept till the sun was high and the birds stopped chirping. Poor her had to work till the wee hours and slept till late. I was awake early and had such a good time using the computer, which usually I don't have the 'permission' to go on for hours and hours. Nice. It was only me and the laptop, seems like I'm conquering the whole technology world (which I'm quite an I.T idiot)....hahaha!!! We took our own sweet time, like a typical old neighbourhood couple, roaming around, grocery shopping and exploring places. Though we did nothing much the whole day, but I believe that company counts a lot. I had a nice time, being simple, away from the hustle and bustle of orchard road. I hope that she felt the same kind of peacefulness  and fulfillment like I did. Sometimes in life, we chase after things we want and get so caught up with all that we simply have no time to stop and smell the roses. It may be insignificant to others but to me, it'll be a tiny sweet memory tugged away.
Heard about this blog thingie  from a very dear friend. I was contemplating whether should I air my thoughts and inner feelings for the whole community to read about. Won't that be an invasion of my privacy? Perhaps...perhaps not. These pages of empty space will just be my witness on what my five senses (maybe six) could conjure up to report on a daily basis. There will be beautiful encounters as well as bad experiences that lurks at every turn or corners in my life. With the good comes the bad, too many experiences,so let me get connected to my inner self and let no one but me to trample on this 'holy grounds' of my own space and fairground. Let the thoughts begin to flow......
My world is like a fairground Like every ride I would venture Mustering all courage within myself I face each day like a roller coaster ride Butterflies in my stomach? Perhaps like a tumbling washing machine? With the person next to me Strong arms holding me tightly Telling me that its alright Close my eyes if I'm scared, " I'll be here" Relax your body Let the ride envelopes you With trust I threw my all into the wind I put my everything into your hands Lying on your shoulders Gripping your hands tightly Holding on to my dear life Fear and Happiness washes through me Wishing that it would end coz of the former Wishing it to last forever coz I have you by my side Its not the destination that matters Its the journey and the one that rides with me that counts Where are you?... Will you?.... Please do
My little Zhumei...Where are you? I miss you. I miss bullying you and having o
