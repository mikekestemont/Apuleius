I'm really going to have to get better at coming up with titles for entries. I just got the urge to sit down and write some more, and then I find myself spending 10 minutes trying to come up with a "witty" title for the post. Sorry. I'm going to just roll with this and see if a better title presents itself.  So I set up a fantasy football league today. I'm a very big football fan, NFL and college. Browns and Buckeyes. It's fairly consuming for me during the season. About six years ago I discovered the fun and simplicity of online fantasy football and I've been hooked since. I've pretty much played with three teams every year, usually one in a gambling league, one in a private league for fun with friends, and one in a general public league. I haven't won a Super Bowl yet, but I've had a team in every year. Two years ago I was a small fraction of a point from $250.00. Last year I ran the money league (I usually do) with a bunch of my co-workers and one of the cocksuckers that worked for me stole the money out of my desk. About $300.00. We all knew who it was but I couldn't prove it. I fired him for a lesser charge a couple weeks later. The worst part about it was he was stealing money from guys that were on his team, that reported to him. And were poor, too. Total asshole.  This year I don't think I'm going to play in a money league. I feel kind of disillusioned after last year. There were some other major issues between people in the league that just couldn't be good sports, so I was pretty miserable most of the year. Fuck that. This year I'll probably play two, maybe three leagues. Last year my wife played for the first time and loved it. She was not a sports fan at all when we first got together, but grew into a pretty hardcore Browns and Buckeyes fan after living with me in Cleveland for a few years. It was pretty cool playing together in the same league, so I invited her into the free league I set up today. I also invited my brother. I've got one friend that I work with and I know he's going to join. I'd like to end up with eight teams total, so we'll have to recruit four more people or else just let Yahoo assign a couple more randomly.  I woke up pissed off today. It wasn't really terribly surprising, as I went to bed pissed off. Pissed at my dumb ass wife. I love her to death and couldn't live without her, but god damn she can piss me off. I tend to let myself get really worked up over stupid shit like that and then carry it with me for a long time. Granted, she kept digging herself in deeper this morning. She just has almost no "sixth sense" of when to back t
