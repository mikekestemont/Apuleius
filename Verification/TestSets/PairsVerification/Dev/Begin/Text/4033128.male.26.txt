Slightly so.  Poured a 50cc bottle of Sprite down my throat and smoked three Marlboros to clear my head, and it seem to have worked at least to some extent. Rumors of another party tonight are floating about.  Last night, Weine started ranting about the meaning of the title of Chicago's track "25 or 6 to 4" so I suggested he used his Google skillz to find the answer. Two minutes or so later he found a post on a lyric site including the chemical composition of LSD: 25R624. It seems most of the groundbreaking artist in the history of music have all been using drugs of one sort or the other. Go figure.
... I'm going to lajlo's place to party tonight. I hope I get to have a fabulous evening, as well as everybody else.
I'm getting awfully tired of dealing with my boss. Today, I finally made up my mind to get a really interesting argument regarding my working environment and motivational perks going, but of course he chose this particular day to be the single day this week he didn't feel like showing himself at work.  I seriously hope I still have as much anger and energy built up next time I meet him (which will probably be on monday). All possibilities considered, I'm preparing myself for a situation in which I will have to change the title of this blog to "Life through the eyes of a geeky former car mechanic."
This evening two friends of mine helped me transport my Mitsubishi Eclipse to my place of work so I can start the work of replacing the head gasket. With a bit of luck and some motivation I will have the head removed by tomorrow evening, ready to be transported to the-guy-who-does-the-grinding. This gives me all weekend to work on a new exhaust system and some other stuff. Maybe clean the car up a bit? The hood needs a bit of scratching and painting, and I should probably replace the plastic stripes on the rear lights with some real paint. I should probably switch wheels, too, since the tires currently mounted are close to the definition of slicks.    All work and no play makes uid0 a dull boy, but if I put my mind to it I might have it ready for the road about the same time as my new driver's license arrives.

I can't get no sleep. In just over four hours all hell will be breaking loose: Loud music and two or three telephone alarms as well as a backup bedside clock should get me out of bed no matter how few hours of s
