This week has been amazing, even though I haven't spoken to Mark on a daily basis.  I have to thank some very special buyers for not only giving me a sense of pride, but unlimited encouragement just by selecting my very first pieces venturing into Oils.   urlLink Maddie's  mom, an absolute dream, as well as my wonderful clients in Germany, the UK, and South Carolina.     When I return from my trip the end of next week, I will be creating a few new pieces in all three of my favorite mediums, and as excited as I am to be able to see my husband, I am also very excited to come home and pick up those brushes!    Thanks,  urlLink Lolo  for the awesome tattoo design!!  We'll take pics of our tats and I'll post them when I get home.   urlLink Here's the design!    urlLink Taba , I'll be thinking of you this weekend and hoping you have a blast at your baby shower!     urlLink Carrie , TONS of thoughts your way too for huge card sales and a successful weekend!!  and  urlLink Joe , I hope everything is going well hanging your cool artwork and can't wait to see the results of your Cafe show!

Today's been one of preparing paintings to ship, running to Dick Blick for a few things (hangers, wire, etc.), scanning, preparing COA's, signing, and shampooing carpets.  (Had to throw that in the mix!)  I'm packed and ready to go, leaving early Saturday morning for a long day of flights (2 layovers, three planes) - This is going to be a "Planes, Trains and Automobiles" kind of day.  I leave here, go to Minneapolis, then to Memphis, then Louisiana, grab a rental car, find my way to the base (1 1/2 hr drive from the airport according to Mapquest) to pick up Mark and a couple of other guys who weren't able to get rentals, then to the hotel.  I figure we'll be settled in at about 8 p.m., after leaving here at about 7 a.m.  It will be a long day!  So now I'm going to have to run to Staples, I ran out of paper clips, bubble wrap and full sheet labels to print my COA's.  Then I will spend the evening with the girls, finish packing in the morning and run to the post office.  Exciting, eh?  Aaah the administrative life of an artist.   I haven't even painted this week, so I won't have any new originals to list until a week after next.  I may put some prints up on auction just so I'm not forgotten while I'm gone!    We lost our nephew yesterday.  :(   Reason unknown, I don't know when services will be, but I am hoping that it will be later next week so we can attend his funeral.  Only 26 years old, it's really hard to wrap your brain around it when t
