Today was the first day of getting a flavour of the "shapeless" beast called community. Went about discussing the launch of new SIG within another user group. this is far from the exact equations of science. this is purely understanding the person in the front and get into his pants. needs a lot of patience and more so a lot of understanding. i am just getting at it!!! some excellent posts on how to carry the user groups forward i found on : www.ineta.org  there is something interesting as well. linux costs more than windows... challenged??? take a look here: www.microsoft.com/mscorp/facts/default.asp i have always believed in this.. here is the proof that it actually made sense.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.
Well, today i got "active" enough to post the kodaikanal photos on web. they are available at : http://photos.yahoo.com/abhishekkant  Kodaikanal is a hill station in south India. yes my friend there are other mountains in India apart from the Himalayas...   took a bus from chennai and made an overnight journey to the "land of clouds" - well this is term i coined. The day we arrived walked up to coaker's walk..   just hung around a little and wasted time.. The funny thing is it was not as cold as we expected.. by evening it rained and finally kodai was a hill station.. The next day we went upto pillar rocks purely on foot..   yes sir, a total of 14 kms of walking... the best was yet to come.. The boating.. as with anything it started with a thud when we took the paddle boat.. The beauty of the thing came out when we started on a rowing boat.. and with it came the rain.. we got wet and kept rowing.. now if u have never done that before u should definitely try that... i wish i could row more.. i will someday..  now things at Bangalore have started to pick up.. i am afraid though that i might loose touch with technology if i ONLY remain in touch with people and not technology.. so here it goes.. i will also be involved in development of shared software.. i know of sourceforge.net.. will check that out and volunteer...  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.
This is my first blog ever.  As I see it, this is a new year, new city (Bangalore, India), new job and great new opportunity to start learning all over again. This represents shift in my world as i start to move away from programming towards interacting with people. More value there defintely, as I firmly believe in the power of like minded people contributing to the same cause.  The start from being an island to being the channel that feeds to the river of knowledge. You'll see more of me now.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.
