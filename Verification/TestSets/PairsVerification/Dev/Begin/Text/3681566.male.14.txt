Blah...I've been really tired lately. I have been getting to bed around 2 o'clock in the morning for the last week. I'm working on a secret project for Admin Central :-X *cough*  website  *cough* I never said anything.  I have just found a host, which was one of the hardest tasks of my life. That is all that I'm going to tell you.  PBv4 is one it's way. Really close. I mean really. I can't wait. I'm going to go do a victory dance on my front lawn when it is released!  G'day to yall!
Whew, I have been really busy the last few days. Our end of the year party was a no-go, mostly due to our good buddy being suspended, for, some reason, it doesn't really matter.

Well, it's only 7:18, and time is going by so slowly! Maybe I'll go for a walk, and that can be the highlight of my day!  Mike :P
I finally figured out how to use it! Pretty simple. Anywho, I guess I will use this to sorta introduce myself!  I am Mike, but alot of people either call me Mikey, or Mikkeey. I am 14, and live outside of London, Ontario! You probaly would have been directed here from either a Proboard or Student Center.  The best thing that ever described me was this personality test that I took. It sounds exactly like me:   Sevens use their mental intelligence to create a positive spin on life by coming up with various utopian possibilities about how things could be. They can be very inspirational as they assert their utopian ideals about how people can live better lives or make the world a better place. Robin Williams is a well-known Seven, and his character in the movie Dead Poets Society is an excellent example of this. By regularly imagining how things can be good or made better, Sevens tend to be very optimistic, and their optimism gives them the confidence to assert t
