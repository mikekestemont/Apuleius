SURRENDER   When most people think of the word surrender, they immediately visualize a white flag being waved.  It is indicative of giving up or being a loser.  In Western Culture surrender is synonomous with weakness in a arena where only winners are strong and celebrated.  People don't want to surrender.  We are taught to fight, to win - at all costs.  Yet I would argue to say that there is strength in surrender.   Imagine that you have fallen into a lake or the sea and you begin fighting to stay above the water.  You kick and scream and flail your arms, yet all you seem to do is sink and swallow water.  In a short time, if you continue with this approach, you will drown.

We may feel that we must say certain things or act in a certain way to please others or get what we need.  We may feel we have to be someone else in order to make someone like us or love us or be accepted.  However, if we try to manipulate the people in our lives, they will never truly love or accept us and, more importantly, we will never truly love or accept ourselves.    Sometimes we experience conflict with others or organizations and we feel we must hold a grudge out of principle than to let it go for our own emotional and mental health.  In addition to the damage this does to our mind and spirit, it also manifests in our bodies as muscle tension and high blood pressure.  In time, it will eat away at our bodies and maifest as dis-ease unless we learn to give up  or surrender our grudge. We fear that if w
