Thursday, went to Niagara last night. LaPlaca showed up under the table and had a Heineken and a Jameson on the rocks. This morning... he did not remember ordering those drinks. Also had apparently opened the cab door and hit himself in the eye. Classic.  I went home fairly early 12:30am, but i'm tired still. woke up at 4:15 for some reason. talked to a friend online for a few. He thought that i was nuts b/c i was awake.  this blog sucks.
I met up dude at Niagara on Thursday night for some drinks, but my bartender friends thought he was weird and were trying to vibe him out. I
bored or maybe tired... I need a television I think, but what's a television without a sofa? ARGH. I got an AC before a sofa. I wish I had real internet instead of wireless only in my hall where I have to sit on the floor. I think my friend is going to hook me up with a discount on printing an oversized poster pf a photo I took. I really need something up on the walls here. It's sad.
So Friday after work I go to meet up with Jason at Starbucks in Union Square We get tea and he wants to sit in the park. He says that 'we need to talk' Uh-oh! We need to talk is never a good thing, so he proceeds to tell me how I'm this great girl and that he loves hanging out with me, and even though i totally don't pressure him to hang out with me and I'm good about letting him have his space, he still feels kind of trapped...uhhhh wtf? He says he doesn't want a relationship, that it's him and not me, and he wished he could, etc... blah blah. So really when it comes down to it, i guess he just wants to slut around, even though he claims that's not really the reason. And after our "talk" over a week ago, he wasn't down for the part where I said if he were going to date anyone else, then go do it, but then let me know because then I didn't want to be involved with him... and so he wants to still hang out, just not under the 'dating' title or something like that. Oh well then. He was surprised that I took it really well. I wasn't going to sit there and say no no no you can't do this. what kind of self-respecting girl should do that. Don't get me wrong, I'm certainly disappointed and I was surprised as hell, but at what would be the point in crying over it. we were only dating, it was only 2 months, and I kind of got the wrong idea, but honestly, i know that i'm okay with it, this shit happens. but that's the story.
Barbeque was fun. People got drunk and silly. I came home and played with my new piece of furniture. Nerdy? Yes, but I don't care so fuck off! It looks pretty f
