Window.  5/25/2003    come through my window and we can hold each other rest with me this mourning and watch the light pour through  hold me in the rainstorm tell me all your thoughts your eyes, they hypnotize me jump in the puddles.  a walk in the woods won't be so bad with your hand to hold you've never been this cold:  so come through my window and we can hold each other rest with me forever and watch the light pour through.
so yea. i was hella bummed because i wasnt able to go to the concert, becase i was in Milwaukee, but we left there at like 7:16. so i got back in town about an hour after that so then i ran around my house like mad trying to get ready and got over to the place adn conviently enoug just as i got out of my car i see nate and Mike. Mike takes a double take and runs over to me and hugs and kisses and spins me. IT WAS SO AWESOME!    and when he was on stage playing the guitar for Nate......i almost died, that had to be the hottest thing in the world. aaaaaaaa boy+guitar= orgasmic.i love it. he got off stage and i like covered him in kisses.    i also got a drumstick and a promo CD yea!    and a bunch of people were there. Brandi gave me a kiss on the lips beore she left it was pretty cool. there was Lee, Nate, Cory, AJ, J
