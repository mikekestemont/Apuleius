I have *finally* chosen the school I want to work at, and luckily, they have also chosen me! I just need to sign the contract and send it with the rest of my documents.   I will leave the first week of August (probably the 4th or 5th) and begin work the 9th or 10th. The school is in the Jangjeon-dong part of Busan near PNU (Pusan National University), which is good because this is the main area that other Western English teachers hang out in, so I won't feel totally isolated. It is also a convenient area for shopping and transportation.   My working hours will be 9-4 M-F to begin with, then in the Fall that will change to 1:30-8 pm M-F. I will be teaching elementary students in classes of ten for 40 or 50 minutes each. For this work I will receive round trip airfare, 2 million won (around $1700) per month, all Korean holidays off and paid, 10 paid vacation days, 3 paid sick days/year, health insurance (not dental), and a studio apartment that is furnished, including A/C, TV, washing machine and microwave.   Pretty good deal!   I am 3/4 excited & 1/4 panic stricken. I suppose that is normal.

After graduating from University and realizing that I had very few marketable skills coupled with a huge amount of debt, I began casting my net for gainful employment that I might not loathe. This yielded nothing for nearly a year.   Stumbling upon ads for "Teach English in Korea!" enough times during my search for that elusive dream job, my curiosity got the better of me and I decided to have a look... I liked what I found. After reading everything I could get my hands on about South Korea, I applied to a few of these ads and posted my resume on various message boards and job sites for teaching English as a second language. The results were overwhelming, the verdict was in: I was moving to Korea to teach English.  As of this post, I have spent countless hours researching this decision, country and culture. I have spoken on the telephone into the wee hours of many nights with various Koreans, New Zealanders, and others in interviews after my eight-hour workdays. Finding the right job has become my second job, but the more I learn the more excited I become.   In preparation, I have had a physical (A+) and the recommended immunizations (F), traveled to the Korean Consulate in Chicago to get my college diploma notarized (it was either that or send the original to Korea... no thanks!) and am in the process of obtaining new contact lenses, a teeth cleaning and fillings, all in order to ensure that I am the c
