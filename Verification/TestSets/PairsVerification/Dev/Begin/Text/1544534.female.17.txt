Voici- so, here are the rhymes with which I have done my prefacing, and their attributations.   I have never forgotten you, Nor ever shall forget- How, unworthy e'en of malice, I earned this abandonment.  -Marie Andouille  A chatar m'er de so qu'ien non volria, tant me rancur de lui cui sui amia, car l'am mais que nuilla ren que sia.   Countess of Dia  (Translation by Meg Bogin, dissertation, "The Women Troubadors", circa 1980)
The easiest part of this entire retelling is the beginning, the root of it all. For, you see, it began with one man, with a man, and a girl who fell in love.   I was not an unusual child in most aspects. I tell you this now so that you will understand how much I have changed, first because of Damien, and second, because of my years and my experience. I was not unusually beautiful, at least not as a girl, nor particularly brilliant, though I would be judged clever, quick. I was not especially wealthy, either, nor from some secret race with tainted blood. I was simply Marie Andouille, the only daughter of Edouard and Marie Andouille. (My parents did not look far for my name.)  I do not remember my parents well. They were both, God rest their souls, entirely unremarkable for their time. My father was a merchant, a glorified tinker, really, who criscrossed the shifting borders of still less permanent nations to carry goods to faires.  Unlike government and civility, trade did not cease upon the outbreak of war, only found ways to avoid the conflict.   Indeed, my parents were entirely average, even at the two things at which they excelled: devotion to their pocketbook and to their god. In truth, in those times, the two went hand in hand, at least to an extent: the Huguenots were rising in the south, and the kings were scrapping over the throne in the north, and their respective churches drained the treasuries of all concerned in the name of a god that did not care for riches, only for love. Said churches also funded and passionately supported the bloody massacres that followed. So much for love.  Both of my parents were devout, but then so was everyone at that time. Even the heretics were devout. It was a pious era, if you were willing to believe that the words men mouthed were prayers, not lies or curses. Perhaps even less surprising, neither of my parents was rich- poverty was far more common in those days than ever the Plague would be.   And so, in a markedly common environment, I was born a remarkably common baby. And grew to be a similarly common girl, truth be known. I stood out only in that I was perhaps a bit more attractive than most, having inherited probably more than my fair share of my parents' good traits. From my mother I gained a head of dark, thick hair, much like the sable my father dreamed of trading. I never knew the color of my father's hair- by the time I
