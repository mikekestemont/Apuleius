Read 1 Timothy 4:12    Can there be a better way to start off a webpage for youth than with one of the most powerful scripture passages for youth???  I think not! :)  Paul was writing Timothy (who was most likely a teen!), encouraging him to do TWO main things:  1.  To not let anyone (the old folk) look down on him because he was young, and                     2.  To be an example to all those around him by the way he talked, the way he lived, the way he loved, what he believed,                      and the way he lived morally.    So does it sound like a piece of cake to do?  Or does it sound impossible or crazy?  Personally, I know that when I was in high school, I thought that this was nothing but wishful thinking.  Because how was I supposed to get the grown-ups to look up to me???  It wasn't recently until it hit me--Part 1 of the verse happens BY LIVING OUT THE SECOND PART OF THE VERSE!  By setting and example   in speech, in life, in love, in faith, and in purity.    So let me encourage you to be that example that Paul calls us to be!  You can do it!  Peace...
Testing. Testing.  One, two, three.  Is this on?  Ok, I think it is....:).    Hola peeps!!!

"Holy Fire"  Holy Fire from heaven Descend to us we pray Let us burn again Holy Fire from heaven Consume our hearts today Let us burn again...let us burn again   All my peeps in the house raise their hand if they're familiar with the phrase, "On fire for God"....ah yes, by the looks of it there's a good number of you who have heard it or used it before.  (Forgive my imagination...I've had some late late, sleep-deprived nights watching the biggest sporting event in the world...the World Cup baby!!) :)  Anyways, it is pretty safe to say that most Christians have heard that phrase used.  You come home from a camp or retreat where you feel as if God has spoken to you and you make a commitment to Him...that you wont' let the fire He lit in you die out.  Or you've been on a mission trip and have been so moved by witnessing the power of Christ firsthand, that its as if you've been set ablaze for him.  I know I've used it plenty of times personally...what about you?  Contact me and let me know your take on it.   In my previous entry, I talked about how easy it i
