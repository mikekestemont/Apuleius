Off today - hope you are as well. We'll be back tomorrow. Have a safe and happy Memorial Day.
This morning I wanted to briefly discuss crafting a job description (needs analysis) when working with recruiters.  To help you - as a recruiter I will definitely want to know about the core competencies required for the job, experience level required, educational background etc and why the vacancy exists.  But I will also want to know who else is on the team and for how long, what are their strengths and weaknesses?  What would happen if one of them left...what is the next most critical skill set required?  A good recruiter will ask a LOT of questions.  We want to know and understand what you really need.  Sometimes you won't know and that's ok.  We work together to find out.    So the next time you have a vacancy begin to think about other members of the team, their core competencies and strengths, so the new hire is a complement to the team instead of just the new hire.  Have a safe and happy holiday weekend.  Lucia
I spoke to a VP of Human Resources for a large company last week who had signed on 15 contingent recruiting firms to assist his in-house recruiters to fill quite frankly, a lot of new jobs.  He was becoming frustrated because of the amount of time updating all of these firms was beginning to take.  On top of that, many of the firms were overlapping with one another and beginning to submit the same candidates.  How is this helping the organization that hired on these firms?  I don't think it is. When trying to decide whether to go to a retained search firm or a contingent one...you have to think of many things - especially the value of your time.  Many firms offer a hybrid approach - we call them engagement fees.  You put a deposit down and pay the balance upon the new hire being made.  Our firm charges for example, a modest $295 down and it's applicable toward the total search fee upon placement.  Why do we do this?  We do it primarily to get your attention, to engage you in this process which goes very well provided there aren't 15 other firms involved.  I understand the need to work with more than one firm in the event we're talking about filling multiple positions. And some firms specialize in different areas as well.  But in selecting search firms, remember to work with those recruiters who work well independently - provide good updates and don't need to talk with you every day for a status update unless there is a need to do so.  By the way, as recruiters, it's our job to find out where our candidates are interviewing and where they've been submitted whether we are retained or contingent.  It wastes an awful lot of time (worth money!) when we don't do our jobs well.....and it doesn't help you, the hiring managers in the least.  If this is happening to you - it might b
