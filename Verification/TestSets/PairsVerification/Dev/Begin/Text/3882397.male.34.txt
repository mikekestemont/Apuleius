Want to put a tshirt from  urlLink HTS  on the next match then Mr Cocky ****?  BTW Interesting spelling of faltering :-!
As I will be vacating next week, it gives Stuart time to practice and get his faultering game back in order. I expect a much closer encounter in a fortnight, but the only way I can forsee defeat is with a  urlLink change of venue .
Satan won 15-10 with his monster 21 ounce supercue from  urlLink Frank in Worthing  proving that new equipment really does make a difference. All that spam was true, then.  He wins control of this blog - unfortunately he is off to Alderney for a week or so, so  don't expect too much while he's there. Don't expect anything from me, either, I'm far too demoralised.  (Does it surprise anyone that the Lord Of Darkness vacates in  urlLink Alderney?  Honestly, he fits right it. Been going for years. Lots of soulmates, so to speak.)  Stuart
Beware Stuart..... I am the proud owner of a new stick which I look forward to beating you with.  Its the bottom blue one in  urlLink this picture .
I got stuffed at squash today despite my fancy new racket so I'm going to be looking for revenge tomorrow night. Are you going to be toting a fancy new cue?
What better way to predict Stuart's mood on a thursday morning than visiting our  urlLink results and statistics webpage . Guaranteed update by 8:45am thursday morning. Thank you Microsoft for making this server page active... hehehe

A good article on  urlLink snooker ettiquette  which gives good tips about how to gain that unfair advantage, as does  urlLink this  with practical examples  urlLink here . My gameplan is progressing nicely, off to buy my posh new cue now !!!!      Disclaimer: Satan does not condone these tactics (within reason).

The big question is will Stuart beat me on wednesday ? Probably not, but I'm happy to publicise my five point distraction-based evil gameplan that will see me through :       Bellow ciggy smoke all around the table, this always distracts ex-smokers.      Ensure a steady supply of guinness and encourage binge drinking.     Bring the topic of conversation around to Microsoft.  Introduce massive variations in the speed of my playing.     Get a posh new cue.
I have invited  urlLink Satan , my opponent in the Wednesday night race to 15, to join this blog: we await his eager acceptance. Followed undoubtedly by reams of taunting for the ignominious trouncing he inflicted on me yesterday - 15-11. Ouch.
Snooker but still good practise exercises:  urlLink here .
A close run game tonight, Stu had the better of the early proceedings, cruising to a 6-3 lead. I pulled it back to 6 all, then close all the way to 13 all. A good clearance by Stu in the next frame, followed by a flukey 9 to clinch it 15-13. Damn...  What I learnt today...       Stuart plays well when sober.      Never buy your chalk from ASDA.      Rileys toilets stink.
Not long to go now, Satan is mentally prepared t
