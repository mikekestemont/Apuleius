It was going to be a boring, depressing (See below) rather sleep deprived Friday until I read that story.  In other news, my Handspring Treo 270 crapped out....again.  On to the third device, the second one lasted barely 3 months. My phone tripped into a spectacular death this morning with a plethora of software and hardware failures: 1. call waiting ceased to work 2. battery refused to hold a charge 3. handsfree crapped out 4. voice quality had deteriorated significantly (from the less than stellar quality it had when it was new) 5. dropped calls galore and bad RF performance.  I must admit I had low expectations for Handspring's build quality as their reputation on web boards was less than stellar.  But this Treo device has exceeded my wildest dreams, more accurately my wildest nightmares.    I give the new (who am I kidding?).....  refurbished device 2 months max before it kicks the bucket.  I thought paying $50 for the device was a bargain, in reality it seems that I have merely broke even as the device has much to be desired in reliability.  Of course, I may be too harsh on Handspring, this was a first generation convergence device and I shouldn't expect much.  What I did expect was a device that retails for $400 to last longer than 3 months under normal use.  Shit, this phone couldn't out last a typical Jennifer Lopez marriage for that matter.  And from what I have heard about the Treo 600, the new $500 second generation convergence device from Handspring, Handspring has done little to improve their build quality.  One plus,  major props to T-Mobile for sending me a newly refurbished Treo 270 and providing a free loaner Nokia to tide me over while it gets here.
It seems that RIAA has once again cranked up the P2P law suit machine.  Given their recent defeat in the US COA, the Record Industry entity is now suing John Does by the hundreds.  Will this slow down P2P usage? Probably not.  An interesting exercise in futility that produces countless false suits against 80 year old grand mothers who don't use computers and 8 year olds.
Am I the only one who'd like to know what the first year rankings are?  They are only mildly important to our careers in the law; nonetheless, I think one month after grades posting the rankings should be updated.  I officially protest!
As the link will show, the number one selling album in the U.S. is the new Velvet Revolver CD: "Contraband".  I will not dispute the quality of the music on the CD as great names grace the production such as Stone Temple Pilots and Guns N' Roses; I do dispute the encumbrances that the record companies have thrown onto the CD.  For those not aware, this CD has a copy protection mechanism embedded in it.  For those light on the technology, I will keep things simple: "you cannot make mp3's from this CD".  That's right, you can only play in your CD player just like goodie-goodie consumer the record companies want u
