its saturday morning and im in school :( we will be meeting for the discussion of 72.1 exam questions. good thing i made it on time. well not really. i was 30 mins late but the meeting hasnt started yet. last night, we watched "Chicago". i guess i expected too much from this movie. much publicity has been made about this film. to be continued...
still awake..cant sleep..rather..dont want to sleep yet..got hooked again on trivia game on mIRC..geez..for the nth time..
waking up early morning really sucks. its as if im going to barf all the liempo and corned beef i ate for breakfast. to top it all, im wearing an ill-fitted jeans which is not really mine in the first place. talk about the karmic cycle! i just finished my email for jomig. i rarely email anyone. its just that i wanted to comment on ien's boylet email. the lack of a boylet doesnt bother me as much as it would have before. enlightenment? yeah right. hehehe. thats probably the reason why im okay now. anyway, got a class in a few minutes. hope everything goes well. laterz..
very lazy day..i woke up at around 11:30 am. almost succumbed to my lazy demon. when i remembered, i had to go to school not to attend dr palisoc's "wonderful" class but to assist jun in his experiment with transducers. anyway, i arrived in UP at around 2 pm and i was able to check the data sheets of my WDE class. anyway, it was a better day compared to yesterday. i just spent most of my time in the faculty room checking my stuff and organizing those damn data sheets i still have to check. all these while listening to Magic 89.9 of course. i almost won their contest. i dont know what went wrong. i want that "maid in manhattan" OST and those RBO tickets. ill try to win those freebies tomorrow.
i feel like crying...
its 3:58 am. certified addict. cant sleep. so many things going on in my mind. 17 days more before my birthday. been asking God the gift that i want. hehe.will i get it this year? i think i better specify what i want exactly. might miss out some important details. geez. i dont want to be alone anymore. Oops. did i just say that? just being  honest. no one knows this blog exists anyway. so back to my ranting. when will my misery end? well im not exactly lonely. my family and friends are with me. and im very thankful to the Lord for that. but somehow, we all need that one person in our lives. id like to think i met the one person 2 and a half years ago. and i wouldnt mind waiting for God knows how long to bring him back into my life. if that is God's plan for us. But i wouldnt refuse a "diversion" while waiting for him to come back. just kidding. ive been wanting to talk with mandela for 2 weeks. i just dont get the point of u
