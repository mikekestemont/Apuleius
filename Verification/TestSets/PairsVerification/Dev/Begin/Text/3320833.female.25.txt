story by Annel Lategan from women24    Who is the petite girl with the cigarette in her mouth, pointing to the genitals of a naked Iraqi prisoner?  Lynndie England the 21-year-old girl from a trailer park in West Virginia, has become the face of one of the worst publicity nightmares the US has had to face. She's the girl of Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison fame, and the woman in many of the photographs depicting the humiliation and abuse of Iraq prisoners of war.   The pictures, which have been published in newspapers around the world, have caused a mass outcry. You'll recognise Lynndie smiling at an Iraqi prisoner who is held on a leash, or grinning alongside with her boyfriend from behind a pile of naked Iraqis (see the News24 link below). But who is she and where does she come from?   Lynndie is the daughter of a rail worker and was brought up in a trailer parked between a sheep farm and a saloon in Fort Ashby, West Virginia – "a backwoods world" as the locals call it.   She joined the army when she was only 17 and still in school. She was apparently so excited about becoming a trooper, she even wore her army gear, boots and all to school. Apparently she even chose to attend basic training while her peers were taking up summer jobs.   After training, she returned to Fort Ashby to work at a chicken-processing plant before signing up with the army's 372nd Military Police Company, based in Cumberland, Maryland. Lynndie was also married for a short time after she left school, but by the time she left for Iraq she was divorced.   Lynndie says joining the army was a way of making money and seeing the world (remember the old saying "Join the navy and see the world. Meet some interesting people and kill them"?). Some reports say she joined the army to further her chances of getting into a good college. (According to Times Online she wants to become a meteorologist.) But some of Lynndie’s army friends know different; they maintain that when she was 18 she couldn’t wait to get revenge on the 9/11 attacks, "We're going over there to kill ourselves some terrorists. Let's go get 'em," she told them.   Private Lynndie England was trained as a clerk, pushing paper for the Military Police. She was assigned to Abu Ghraib prison, near Baghdad, to help process prisoners. Her job was never to guard them - she wasn’t trained for that. According to reports her friends and 35 year old boyfriend, Charles Graner, worked with the prisoners and she visited them in the evenings after work.   Now, at the age of 21, a pregnant Lynndie faces military charges including conspiracy to maltreat prisoners and assault consummated by battery. She could be charged with up to 15 years in prison. Lynndie fell pregnant in Iraq by Charles Graner, who is also depicted in some of the photos and similarly faces charges of prisoner a
