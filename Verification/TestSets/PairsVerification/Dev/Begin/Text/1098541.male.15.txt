For instance....Omelets.  When one talks to me about a omelet, I think of Hamlet, soooo two different images come to mind.  One is an ham omelet.  The second is Ben Alshire wrapped up in egg screaming.  The Ben one comes more often than not.  But the point is......the point is that instead of killing whales for their blubber, we should instead give them liposuction.  Therefore we have our blubber, and the whales are nice and trim.  Though the whale aerobic instructors might be a little miffed.  But they can suck it up and get another job like.....I don't know....plumbing??  Well that's all, good bye all my little grape vines in humus.  Nora a.k.a- the whaling liposuction surgeon naturalist.

Wellllllllllllll.........tis a loverly day, but I wouldnt know cuz I dont have a lover but thats allllll besides the point. The point is.......the point is the dolphins dont like sea water, but they only like to live there because they like the free salt for their margaritas.  That the only reason they act so stupid and allow us to screw with their minds.  But thats not the point either........what the hell are you looking at me like that????  Does it look like I know the point.  For someone who thinks dolphins are alcoholics you sure have a lot of faith in me.  Gezzz.........*walks off muttering...then 800 lb wreaking ball swings down and kills her.  Aplause fallows.*   (the following is from Logan since she isn't on her own computer.)
