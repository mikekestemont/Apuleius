Well, I haven't posted in awhile so sorry about that if anyone is reading this.   It has been an interesting week to say the least.&nbsp; My now ex-girlfriend came home for the weekend.&nbsp; Friday night we watched a movie and then she even kissed me.&nbsp; It was a nice pleasant evening.&nbsp; However, it was kind of weird considering she had just told me the day before that she had gone to the bars again with this guy.&nbsp; Now we are not together but it still hurts.&nbsp; Kicker is is that she asked him to go with her this time.&nbsp; I don't think that she is telling me everything about him or her ex-boyfriend before me that she has admitted to liking.   Anyways, Saturday we got into this big fight.&nbsp; She said that she couldn't get over the Ryan situation.&nbsp; (Ryan is the girl that I met and am friends with that&nbsp;my ex-girlfriend&nbsp;and I had huge fights and problems over last semester)&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I finally got up enough guts to tell her off a little.&nbsp; I told her that I did nothing wrong with Ryan.&nbsp; That I have never&nbsp;cheated on her or have even come close to cheating on&nbsp;her.&nbsp; I also told&nbsp;her&nbsp;some other things.&nbsp; Well, she started&nbsp;crying.&nbsp; I didn't mean for this to happen but I had to tell her these things.&nbsp; There are many more things I want to tell her like that I don't believe her when she tells me&nbsp;she has done nothing more than kiss these guys that she has cheated on me with.   Sunday, her and I went up to the Bear Trap Festival&nbsp;up on Casper Mountain.&nbsp; It was nice...hot though.&nbsp; I got sunburned&nbsp;pretty bad.&nbsp;   Well, I will try to write more tomorrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;
So, I had a ton of relatives stay at my place this weekend on top of my aunt moving in with my family.  To sum it up quickly, I had two aunts and one uncle actually staying at my house and two cousins and their four very young children running around the house the rest of the time.  All and all it wasn't that bad of a weekend....just long.  The only really bad thing is what is still happening with my girlfriend/ex-girlfriend.  She and I are still talking.  It now sounds as if she wants to keep talking and hangout and even still be together.  She says that she sees that she was just being dumb.  Ok, I will give her that but this isn't the first time that this has happened.  Am I just supposed to forget everything and take her back.  It hurts being cheated on or having the person you like think that she is falling in love with another guy.  Especially when those guys are really geeky looking and ugly.  That just makes me feel like a dog ugly person.  I guess maybe I am.  I just don't know what to do with that situation.  I am scared to move on and leave her.  Speaking of being scared.  I am absolutely mortified about law school starting in a month.  I am a
