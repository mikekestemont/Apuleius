Driving is a strange experience.  At first I had very little skill and it was subtly nerve racking.  Then I gained experience and it became natural, but there is still a strange, subtle experience underneath it, a strange feeling.  It is like visiting a far away land where you don't fully understand everything that is going around you.  Every so often this feeling develops into one of almost panic as I try and figure out whether or not the directions I got were good ones, or if I just missed the exit.  When you are on the highway, one hour away from home, without a cellphone, you really are alone.  You don't have family or friends to support you or double check you.  I can handle almost everything that is thrown at me, but it is wierd having so few safety nets. My guess is that my driving experience will change as I learn more, and also that the strange, lack of safety net feeling will occur more often as I go to college and start living on my own.
I just finished doing dishes.  I discovered a while ago that cleaning is easier when you have a vision of how pleasant it is to live in a clean house.  Every action you take you can see the reality approaching that dream.  So you really aren't doing work, you are discovering a dream.  I discovered a clean kitchen.  Very pleasant.
I've been really impressed lately by how wrong anger almost always is. While reading "How to Read a Book", I came acrossed an extremely interesting section on arguments.  It basically gave the guidelines for having a productive and useful argument.  It pointed out that in order to have a beneficial and non-contentious argument, you need to have a higher goal than winning the argument.  You must be seeking for the truth.  An argument should be a journey for all involved, not a battle.  This requires being humble (teachable).  Also, arguments go easier when they are motivated by hope, not anger.  Anger, or anything that looks like anger, has no place in a constructive argument.  It is not necessary.  There are ways of being firm about your opinion without being angry (Mormon missionaries).  While arguing, you must always respect the person you are arguing with.  He/She is a person too, with life experiences, knowledge, and potential.  Gordon B. Hinckley in a speech that I read encouraged BYU students to discuss and debate.  It is a necessary part of coming to understand our society and eternal truths, and there is something extremely central about understanding.
I graduate from High School today.  At 5:30 PM the ceremony begins.  I walk across the stage, get my diploma, listen to the valedictorian, the salutatorian, the class officers, and the class advisors give speeches that I have heard many times before.  It doesn't make the words they say any less true, but it does make them slightly repetitive.  They will talk about dreams and goals and working for the improvement of society.  I'm looking forward to it actually, because t
