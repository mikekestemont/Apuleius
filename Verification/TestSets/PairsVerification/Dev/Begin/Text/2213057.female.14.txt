now i am at school. i'm in mr. watkins's class. if you've had him you know the class sucks, but he is so funny! and slow, very slow. class is almost over so i better go. i'll write later to see if my night/ day (because it's halloween) is worthwhile. to all the people who actually read this, i love you.
okay... my friends have better started to check.
yes, yes, i am a genius!!! it works!!!
whoa, this is complicated...will it work?
okay... i've gotten this far, i know how to sign in. now i have to figure out how to get to my blog. if anyone knows and can explain, email me at funkeemunkee_69@hotmail.com. please!
i hope this works. we'll see.
alright, holy crap! i haven't written since tuesday. sorry guys. i'm at the library for the second night in a row. grr... stupid science. actually reading about the progressing reproduction of human and animal cells (cloning) is quite interesting... yet extremely boring. i saw matt breton at the library yesterday. heather is apparently mad at me for saying her hair was messy. but it was!!! connor is getting to be weird. i miss a lot of my old friends that i never talk to or see anymore. i got pretty big plunger stubs today. i can't WAIT for the band wars. until next time, gaze longingly into the distance and growl and cross your eyes at the person who asks if you're okay. lol, bye!!
yesterday was awesome. i had a really good day. today will probably suck because it has so far. turns out i made leslie cry. oups. i hate (well... strongly dislike) andrew and josh. they're horribly mean. ethan is cute. ha, ha!
alright, sorry i haven't updated in a long time. i dissapointed (disapointed?) my followers *sigh*. i had an okay weekend. i made a lot of money (well, to me at least). thursday night was so fun! i went to my grandparents on friday night and worked all weekend. i came home on sunday night and called soemone(s) then i did my laundry. oh ya, i asked my sister to come to the pretty big plunger concert with heather and i next week and she said yes. it's cause i never see her and i miss her. i also wish her the best of luck with matt, i hope he treats her better, or else i will brutally kick his ass. good thing she doesn't know about this or she'd be mad. so my weekend was okay. i don't really have any plans this week. except i have tons of band pratices and stuff. but that shouldn't be too bad. oh ya! i found this AWESOME 80's music my grandma sent over a while ago and i love it. love amazing amounts, bekah. oh ya, and leslie is the biggest liar (don't worry jenna, i'll beat her for you) natty isn't looking al lthat great either.
today is better. at least i think it is, it had been so far. the i'm-such-a-loser-i'm-feeling-sorry-for-myself-because-i-suck is gone. and i (wonderful rebekah) is back! tonight s
