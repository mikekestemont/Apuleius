Today I found out about a heartbreak, an earnest wish, and a death in the family of a dear friend...through a blog.   So it has come to this. Isolation breeds alienation; solitude leads to loneliness.    Mea culpa.
I used to have a website. I sort of miss it. If  only for the fact that I met some of the most interesting people in my world through that site. But then I thought I'm way too old or too busy for the website, or for those interesting people, or maybe both for both.   I think I simply ran out of words to keep up that site. And maybe I ran out on spirit to keep those people. My words lost its spirit; my spirit ran out of words.   So I kept to myself until I've figured out who "myself" really is. I'm only beginning to get there and each discovery is a revelation, a pleasant surprise, an unraveling.   The unlearning of who I thought I was has only just begun. I guess I'm still trying to get comfortable in this skin sans the pretensions, embellishment and the compulsive urge to please others. Took me ages to get here and maybe it's too late, but hey, it's cool!  So I leave by the wayside the things and places and people that have weighted me down to make room for the things and places and people that truly matter.
There's a song that goes, "Early in the morning I cook breakfast for your table and make sure that your coffee has its sugar and cream. Your eggs are over easy...yadda, yadda."   My friends and I used to joke that this is the ideal song for when you're trimming your toenails or plucking out the hairs from your armpits. Personally, I believe this song was written while the composer was doing the number two in the loo. I picture the singer recording this bit while waxing her legs.  But hey, the song's a certified pop hit! It got so famous that one ex-Miss Saigon's singing career almost took flight with the Tagalog version ("Hindi ako si Darna...").  My point? Some people put too much energy into things that, when put in their proper perspective, are...well... silly. I'm one of those people sometimes. So as I was saying, "I'm not your superwoman..."
Secondborn, middle child, weaned in violence, sired by a father who mistook fear for respect. You grew up half-believing you  are  worthless and would never amount to anything---like he used to say in those fits of fury.   He lashed at you with his belt or a solid piece of wood or anything he could get his hands on, but his most terrible weapon was his words. The pain subsides, the marks fade, but the words...how can you forget those terrible words??    And your mother...saintly, martyred, ever the pacifist...she wh taught you how to cry in secret, suffer in silence, and just "be good so Tatay  won't get angry anymore." Does she know how you despise her for not standing up to him, tolerating his abuse, letting h
