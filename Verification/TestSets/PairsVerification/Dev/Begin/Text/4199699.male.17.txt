August 22nd...     I had something that wiil be on my list of the most  memorable moment in my life... Or I can say... Moment when i feel the presence  and the plan He's been working on me...     It all start from Yesterday...      As usually I went to my church for the youth  fellowship every Saturday night at 7 p.m. That day I was told that today I'll  have to be on a meeting with all the rest of the committee in the church... I'll  have to represent the youth commitee since I'm the president. It's a regular  meeting held every three months. That time I said that I'll be on church  tomorrow which is today...     Now the story is getting nearer to the problem..       Later that night around 11 p.m. I received a sms  from a friend asking me to go to Carita beach with him the next day which is  today...     The problem is that I already promised to be on  church to follow the meeting..     That time I was faced with two options... It's  whether I keep my promise to be on the meeting or having fun with my friends  which is a rare thing.. Cause I don't spend much time going out with  him...     I must admit that time I was really fond of going to  the beach.. To be honest I never go there before.. Moreover, usually on the  meeting I only need about 15 minutes to report and the rest 2 hour will be used  on things that have nothing to do with my commitee...     So.. I start preparing the war tactics.. I called my  friend... I told him that I'll be going with him to Carita... I prepared my  report and decided to have my sister to give it indirectly to the person in  charge with the meeting...     I finally finished my report around 12 a.m.  midnight... Even I have to had this phone call from a girl I just knew... I  finished my report and I enjoyed the conversation... (Probably i'll put some  writings bout her)     And the plan worked really well... There was no  phone call or sms asking me to go to church.. But it seems that GOD has  different plan for me...     Suddenly my friend called me and said that we got  new company and this person is the sister of my other friend's girlfriend... GET  it??? Ok then.. Well the point is they can't say no to her.. And I have to give  my place... At this point I was really upset with my friend but I never want to  spend my time cryin' on my lowest mood... I always look on the brighter  side..     SEE.. This means that GOD wants me to do my duty and  wants me to be His servant.. Be at the meeting and do my president servant  job... I must admit that time something 'clicked' in my mind... I realize a  couple days ago I just made my promise to serve HIM more and do more to change  my bad attitude.. Well H
