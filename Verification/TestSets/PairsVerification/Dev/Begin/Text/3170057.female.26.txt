Ah, John. This would be my vow to you...  “There is no room in my body for anything but you. My arms love you; my knees shake with blind affection. My mind begs you to ask it something so it can obey.”   Thanks Buttercup, or should I say William Goldman =)

I am scared, and at the same time excited about the things going on in my life. I really don’t know which emotion to hang on to. Especially with regards to this great guy.  He is such a wonderful person. A very pleasant surprise.  But I have to play this one coolly. Think things through. But gawd! He is so much wonderful. And our conversations keep playing in my head like a sweet lullaby.  Oh dear john…
"When you feel it in your body you found somebody who makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew said you act like you ready but you dont really know and everthing in your past- you wanna let go"  damn! I have it so bad for this guy.  I'm dead!
hmmm...  the silence is deafening... i can almost hear my mind processing... scary... total silence can be sickening... i want some music...i crave for some noise... yet, all that is playing is silence... and this is making me sad...making me very sad... is this a preview of my next 20 years? a life of total silence... deprived of sound?
Damn! Damn! Damn! Why am I in limbo again?  Damn! Damn! Damn! All I can think of is us…together! Damn! Damn! Damn! But I shouldn’t be doing this, I shouldn’t be thinking about us! Damn! Damn! Damn! Stop beating you foolish heart!  Damn! Damn! Damn! I am sick, and the only cure for this tattered soul of mine is him! Damn! Damn! Damn!
