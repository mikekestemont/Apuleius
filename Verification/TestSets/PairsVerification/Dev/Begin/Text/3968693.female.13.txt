Hi! I am back after a few days.Anyway i will write some extremely important things about my past, like my deepest & darkest secrets or desires! My first crush was on a Indian[tamil]-muslim guy who is one year older than me.His name is Hameedul Ansar.He is a south indian,tamilian to tbe precise.He is a muslim too. What can i say about him? Hameedul is very tall, slim,dark,intelligent,studious,diligent,responsible,energetic and very very good-looking!!He was in my primary school Ahmad Ibrahim Primary School. He is one year older than me, but he is extremely mature and responsible for his age. All the teachers in my school were extremely fond of him. He is also an football maniac! He is not only very good in his studies but also in  sports most importantly in his character! Girls were completely mad about him but he was very modest and stayed away fom such distractions.You wont believe this but my best friend  HONEY CRYSTEL S. APALE also had her first and major crush on him too just like me!Anyway i always kept this as a secret and nobody got to know aout this , even now other than god and me!  I had a major crush on him for 2 whole years from the age of 10 to the age of 11.I was totally mad about him. I even remember myself praying to god everyday so that i can win his heart !!!!I met him almost everyday at school and whenever  he was absent , i used to get very upset. He was my school heart-throb!!Every day after school the two of us used to take the same route to home but we never talked to each other as i never dared to and he didnt even know me well! And then  he got promoted to a secondary 1 in a completely new school, Victoria secondary school, which is a pretty good school it is only for boys. He is in secondary 3 this year. After moving to his new secondary school i never saw him again that was the end of my 1st major crush- HAMEEDUL ANSAR.  After 1 year, i had this much deeper and my second crush on this bengali guy from my bangla school bus.I will write more tomorrow as my pathetic dad is irritating me, i dont understand whats his problem.He keeps on disturbing as well as lecturing me on what to do and what not to do. He is a complete idiot and a total fool! Bye,see ya later!!!
