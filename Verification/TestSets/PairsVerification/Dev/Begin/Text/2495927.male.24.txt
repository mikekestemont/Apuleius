There.  I've decided to finally move my blog from  urlLink  my old journal   to here in an effort to get myself into an easier (and customizable) format.  Now all I have to do is learn a little more HTML  ----  Anyway, watch this space everyone! :)  There'll be a ton of layout bloopers, but at least the reading will be worth it. ;)  Catch you guys later!  I've got some fixing up to do on this site. :D
"This... Lycanthrope you speak of, has been p-plaguing us for months."  Hans began,  trying to compose himself as he looked out the window, staring at the evening sky, "It started with several attacks on the wildlife on the edges of the town."  The Confessor listened quietly, his eyes narrowed.  Hans wrung his fingers nervously, "It was just a few weeks ago when it attacked" Hans faltered, "or rather ate, a person." His eyes met the Confessor's before dropping down to look at the floor.  "Who was it?"  This time, it was the strangely angelic voice of Joanna du Winter.  The woman sat demurely, as she opened her fan.  "Jonas,"  Hans replied, grateful for the distraction from the Confessor's piercing gaze,  "The local c-cobbler."

Hans gave a weary sigh, "p-please, these are guests..." he said touching his brow as if to ward off a headache.  "What is the meaning of this?"

Hans opened his mouth to speak, throwing a fearful and apologetic glance towards the Confessor when Joanna spoke.  "And what would you have your father do?"  Alice whirled to face the woman, her eyes narrowed, "To take up a sword and to hunt the beast down."  her voice dripped with barely contained disdain, "To honor the family line and prove that he's not a sniveling rat!"  Joanna fanned herself calmly, "And you think that charging headlong to fight a beast that has slain four people with nothing but that overgrown knitting needle of yours is a prudent choice?"  "And what do you think  you  could do, harlot?"  Alice spat, "All dressed up in frilly dresses and-"   "I can do  this "  Joanna replied calmly, cutting off the girl's angry speech.  Alice's face suddenly seemed a
