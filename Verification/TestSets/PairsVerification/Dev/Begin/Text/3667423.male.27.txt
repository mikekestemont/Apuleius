The Sabbath   I am convinced, as I have been for a few years, that the Sabbath does not begin and end at midnight.  Nor do I believe the Sabbath somehow begins (or germinates) when one goes to sleep, awaking to the Sabbath.  Rather, I believe the Sabbath begins and ends at sunset, as it did for the Jews.  Though our American days do not begin and end until midnight, I do not think it is the manner experienced by the Jews and Christians in first century Palestine.  The practical implications of the Sabbath beginning and ending at sunset far outweigh that of a Sabbath beginning at midnight (when everyone is asleep) or when one awakes an hour or two prior to corporate worship.  At sunset, on Saturday evening, a person or family can begin preparing for the Sabbath corporate worship.  One can prepare the whole evening prior to going to sleep, rather than trying to prepare an hour or two prior to corporate worship.  A family or individual can worship together on the Sabbath, preparing for corporate worship prior to resting the night away.
Though I started volume eight of  The Works of Thomas Goodwin , as well as  Justification Vindicated  by Robert Trail, I have decided to pick up a good piece of fiction.  The latest book I take with me to work, the bathroom, the living room, study, and bedroom is  A Confederacy of Dunces  by John Kennedy Toole.  The book is about a thirty year old man, Ignatius Reilly, who lives in New Orleans with his mother, Mrs. Reilly.  Ignatius is the epitome of an arrogant dunce, though not to exclude his intelligence and creativity.  His efforst are slothfulness to the Nth degree.  He has a flare for overdramatics at every point.  It is quite hilarious to read about his life, especially in the dialogue.  He is a large and obese man of thirty years of age; lives with his mother; doesn't have a jog; graduated with a masters, though; is a slob; a pig; and an absolute repugnant person.  It is a classic.  A Confederacy of Dunces is a pulitzer prize-winning novel, and it is easy to see why.  The book is a modest 400 pages, and I'm only in the mid-one hundreds, and I'm already "hooked."  I was hooked from page one, though.  I do believe this book (behind the title page) contains one of the best quotes I've ever read:  When a true genius appears in the world, you may know him by this sign, that the dunces are all in confederacy against him (Jonathan Swift--"Thoughts on Various Subjects, Moral and Diverting").   There is some "language" in the pages, but it is not rampant or gratuitous.  Anyone who can stomach an occasional "cuss word" must read this for a good laugh.  It is a classic piece of contemporary fiction.
I have decided to make " Theological " its own category, too.  Under this I will related all of my personal religious reflections, whether of academia or subjective natures, and ponder many queries.  It is amazing how m
