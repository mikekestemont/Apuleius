Today, I feel the need to bitch. Yesterday was undeniably the day from hell.  Work was bleh, as it usually is on a Monday. Saunter in around 8:30ish to voicemails from my anal retentive prick of a supervisor and proceed to be put in an absolutely horrible mood due to the simple fact that he's a lonely, unhappy man and misery loves company. He is only the beginning to a day where I sorta wish I lived in some 3rd world country like Canada or something...  Next up! A few months ago, I lent a close friend almost $500. This was an emergency as she needed to see the doctor and make her car payment and such and I had the extra cash so I helped her out. (I'm such a sweetheart, I know.) Anyway, this month has been a bit tough for me monetarily so I asked her if she would be able to pay me back just a little bit of the money. She said "Sure! Monday, I'll cash my paycheck and we'll meet for lunch." Never got a response to my morning email and figured she was busy.  Work continued to get shittier as I had an political debate with a friend of a friend at lunch and got fired up at his complete ignorance on such matters. I think the only thing worse than an idiot is a loud idiot. So finally, 5pm rolls around and I bolt outta here. I get home and take a shower and try to calm myself. She waltzes in, throws her purse down, and proceeds to smoke some "happy smoke". I mention the check. She gets flustered and acts frustrated and says "Yeah, I cashed it." End of discussion. I then decide that maybe I should mention the fact that my gas light has been on all day and I'm running on fumes. Response: "That sucks. You should get cheaper gas since you have to drive so far every day." What the fuck?!?! YOU should pay back the money you owe, especially to a friend that's struggling.  Ultimately, I think I have got to learn my lesson. Not everyone values friendships the way that I do and not everyone is willing to put others before themselves like I do. And that's fine. Everyone is different. I just can't keep lending selfish people money. Why money means so much to certain people is beyond comprehension to me. If I have enough to pay my bills, then I'm willing to help out the people that I care about. I just have to start viewing people for what they're worth instead of blinding myself to any and all faults.  Okay, I feel better now. I'm just really in need of something to fall into place for me. I truly believe that everything happens for a reason. But I'm beginning to wonder when there will finally be a reason for something GOOD to happen...
It has been a long time since I've played the dating game. And I'm not talking about the cheesy Chuck Woolery 8
