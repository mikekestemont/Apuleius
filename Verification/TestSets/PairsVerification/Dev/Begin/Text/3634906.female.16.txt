well my brother ended up getting us tickets for tonight so i feel kind of bad about what i said but its still very true that he has bailed on me a lot... wahhhahh oh well i give up on that but i do feel mean about what i said...
i am so sad today because yet again my brother canceled on me!! hes such a bastard... you want to hear his reasoning?  yes well because his darling mariah doesnt want to go... who fucking cares if she doesnt want to go she doesnt have to but dont bail on kelly and i and leave us here in the dust because the girlfriend just doesnt want to... god damn it... i cant fucking stand people who do everything there significant other tells them to... i understand that my brother and mariah are in a serious relationship but that doesnt make him any less of a brother to me... and hes canceled every plan since january that we have ever had whether it be something big or something little it all adds up... i just cant wait to hear that we arent going to see dashboard confessional because mariah doesnt want to... AHHH i just want to scream!!! anyways... i think that i am going to see the ataris tomorrow!! but it kind of sucks because i have no one to take with me which means its just me and my dad... oh well... and also friday at dashboard is kind of going to suck because its going to be kev and riah and then me... AHHH i hate being with couples!!!  i just realized right now that i am really crabby... i hate being crabby but sometimes it happens... but i am just going to keep thinking of how much fun camping is going to be with all my relatives and amanda... we are going to have a blast... and im going to get a tan!!! Hallelujah!!! although i think that im going to miss my poor little pale body... i really have come to terms with being pale and i actually think that it goes well with the dark hair and dark eyes... i dont think that being tan would make me look all that attractive... who knows??? the pale skin works for me... anyways one last thing before i go for a little while... my favorite teacher in the whole wide world... mrs. heideman... who teaches art has invited my brother, jamie, and i to go sailing with her!!! AHHH ive never been sailing but i am so excited to go!!! so tomorrow when we finish touch ups on the mural we are going to plan a date!!!
yet again another day has almost gone by... im about to leave for the stalkers house... yes i know i keep leading him on because im the one calling him but still im calling him because hes my friend... anyways amanda and i are heading over there so that we can watch nip/tuck there!!! YAY... who loves niptuck??? we do!!! everyone does... w
