Man I haven't written one of these forever.  This past weekend was pretty cool.  Youth was awesome I loved the worship and the small groups were cool.  Saturday I went and helped the food bank that was rad.  Umm sunday I went to church and then set up a trampoline and then I played softball later that night.  My Life with God is pretty good:)...It's kinda tough not having many people to talk to.  I wanna be the light Jesus has called me to be but it is tough.  God's been keeeping me real busy lately sorta to get my mind off the friend situation.  Right now...SOnja is kinda my only good friend and it sorta sucks but at least she's a rad girl:).  I'm trying to live this thing for God and just be the light in the darkness and just try and live for God with my all.  I find it way easier to hang out with people who actually give a crap bout what's goin on in my life.  I love it when people just take time to talk with me and stuff.  I find myself being really fake when I'm with people that already have a bunch of friends and I mean nothing to them.  I love it when I act like the Real Jordan It feels great:).    I'm not quite sure of God's purpose or his plan...But everyday I wanna live Christ:).  It's totally worth it to surrender your all to God cuz he'll only do great works in u.  I haveta stop being of the World...and just be fully like Christ.  My life has a pretty bright future in that It's gonna involve Jesus and God's Plan soo it has to be bright.  I haven't changed soo dramtically yet that people wouldn't know it's me...but that's what I'm planning on doing.  Changing into a true christ follower instead of one of those kids who have things good in their Lives but they never effect the rest of the world.  ANd just let Jesus take hold of everything.  It takes alot of Faith and I am afraid...I shouldn't be but I am...I wanna become fully real and act the same around everyone.  I'm hoping that over the summer and stuff I can really get some friendship booming and just also become really close with God and become real.  People usually fall away from God in the summer I wanna do the opposite and just stick to God like glue.  ANyways guys...If u need prayer just write it in a comment or email me:) That'd be great...It also be Rad if u guys all pray for me and that My walk with CHrist would turn into a sprint:P ANyways cya all later bubye and GOD BLESS AMERICA:) haha not GOD BLESS U:P
These past few days I've been pretty busy...Me n Josh built a soccer net yesterday after church...It's pretty sweet:D.  Today I went boating with my family and that was really fun.  My dad basically let me drive the whole time it was awesome.  My life i
