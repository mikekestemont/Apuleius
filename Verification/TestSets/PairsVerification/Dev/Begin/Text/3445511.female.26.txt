On Friday C and I were listening to the radio are on our way home from school. These days it seems that there are more and more advertisements and worthless music.  Anyways....it was one particular advertisement segment that caught C's ears. It was a commercial for the Hess gas station. That in itself is exciting for C....and the reason would be the fact that this particular gas station sells really cool vehicles during the holiday season. The vehicle of the year is a must have according to C. So the Hess station is "wicked cool" in C's eyes. He believes we must  always  buy gas from the Hess station...."because Hess is best" says Carter.  So...I crank up the volume when I hear that the Hess station is now selling a mini tanker truck for a limited time only. C is instantly psyched. He feels we must drive right this moment to the Hess station because he fears they will sell out of this silly truck if we don't. He pleads his case again and again, but remains fearful that the "limited time only" will end before we get there or they will sell out of this super special truck.  Well, we don't end up at the Hess station instantly....but nearly so. We got there Saturday afternoon, and luckily they still had a few million trucks in stock. The man at the counter suggests that I should buy at least two...one for the kiddo to play with and one to keep in the box. I realize that many probably collect Hess trucks, but I'm not about to become one of those people. One was plenty for us.  http://www.hesstoytruck.com/ Here is the website...go take a look at this "must have".
I love the mind of a five year old. It is always constantly trying to figure the world out. C is always trying to get to the bottom of things. He always wants to know how and why things work they way they work. Of course I'm always just amazed at what comes out of his mouth. I love the continuous why questions, most of which I have no real answer. So we venture to look things up together....it's fun.  He has such a thirst for knowledge that I hope doesn't fade when he heads off to school...   For example:  Tonight C is in the bathroom brushing his teeth. He wants to know why he can't see germs. He states that it would just be easier to get rid of them if he could just see them. I explain they are really, really tiny and you need a microscope to see them....he's like yeah..."they must be microscopic".  and I'm thinking....Microscopic...where did he pick that up? I also joke around that germs are smart and they know that if they remain super tiny...they can get away with tooth decay.  He then asks what color are germs. This is the question I don't really have an answer to (brown?). This has question has never really crossed my mind. So I tell him that I really d
