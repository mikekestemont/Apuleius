Thats absolutely right!!!...India won...and were in the finals....WOHOOOO!!!....the match was simply brilliant...both the teams had its ups and downs...it was a nail-biting finish...and India relieved everyone off the massive amount of tension that had been building up in the atmosphere...    &nbsp;  I think both the teams played a fabulous innings...and id give the credit to India not because they won...but because they finally, after these many matches, played as a team....tendulkar might not have lasted long...but his 4s were just splendid...sehwag, ganguly and yuvraj played an explosive innings....if i had to criticise abt the&nbsp;batting, it wud be dravids and kaifs poor form...and as for balling pathan was pretty good...and zaheer as usual messed it up quite a lot....i mean come on...he gave 40 runs in 3 overs...tht sucked...sehwag did miracles with the ball just like he did with the bat...as for the srilankan id like to thank them for the injuries of vaas murali and zoysa...and wud love to compliment on the tremendous knock of 130 runs by jayasuriya...    &nbsp;  All in all I was just happy the match ended pretty well for me...and im also happy the paki team is going back home...or like saad puts it "ga ga ga ga ga....on ur face...and more ga ga ga"...newayz...yesterday was just brilliant for me....im really glad tht we won the match and were into the finals...and hopefully the finals wud be as intense...as this match was....newayz i just finished dling Van Helsing...i knw its been sometime since the moveis released...but cudnt find the right file for a few days...newayz.. im off...take care all of you....    &nbsp;  Allah Hafiz...    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;
