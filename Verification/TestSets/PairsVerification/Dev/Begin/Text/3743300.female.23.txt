I want to run away and live as a cattle rancher with a rough tough and deep man who will make love to me at the base of a canyon in the middle of nowhere while I scream his name fearlessly in the isolation.  We discover artchaelogical finds and he doesn't talk very much and we fight but its really sexy fighting cuz we always end up mauling each other hastily declothing one another and passing out in sheer exhaustion afterwards.    When we wake up we're silent and complacent and pretty much forgot about the whole fight and he makes poached eggs and we chew our food silently and surrendered.  It would be a nice weekend trip anyway...
Kat walked into the church silently, looking around in the back for a seat and attempting to avoid notice.  She found a several pews in the corner, dimly lit and empty.  A large group of people her age had congregated in the mid back but though they were all talking and looking for people from the crowd, they seemed to look right through her.   This suited her.  Kat was not shy or anti social but today just felt like a day to be invisible.  Looking down and letting her hair cover her face, losing herslef in her own thoughts, she seemed to repel people and no one came over to say hi or sit with her.  It had been three months since she saw him last.  She had known a couple of his friends.  She saw them now, talking somberly with other people.  She felt no need to say hello.  She felt incredibly lonely, and that was how she wanted it.    Something felt wrong about the whole grand event.  The adults spoke as though they knew Chris.  They knew parts of Chris.  Girls sobbed in crowds.  They knew parts of Chris...  Three hundred people knew parts of Chris.  What were the missing parts?    I guess it doesn't matter how many friends you have.  You can still be terribly lonely.    Kat left the ceremony early, leaving a solid silver ring on his casket and disappearing through the doors.  When the crowd had said their final goodbyes, they filtered through the back doors into the bright afternoon sunlight.  The breeze carried the scent of cherry blossoms.  The trees swayed lazily.    Later a couple of people mentioned that they had seen Kat... and where had she gone?  But she left town.  She uprooted.  She had picked up and moved out and said all her goodbyes.  She was a road girl now.
