Think about New Years resolutions     Think about making New Years resolutions     Think twice about those resolutions     Defer making any resolutions till the next NYE    That sounds alright.
We all know that anyone, anywhere, for any reason whatsoever can find that there is No Evidence to support Anything. Data, thusly, is meaningless. Only the latest "There is no Evidence" is the real truth, and how much they were paid to make their claims.  Bottom Line: Money Talks, Truth Walks.  So, dear readers, remember always that there is no evidence until it happens to you, but by then you will have become a statistic, your data is thus meaningless, and you are thereby forgotten.

In 1981 NASA sent up the first space shuttle, which used Intel 8086 processors for a host of diagnostic equipment. More than 20 years on these chips are still being used to make sure the shuttle's twin booster rockets are safe for blast-off, and NASA is finding it increasingly hard to replace any faulty chips.  In the future the space agency plans to create a new US$20 million dollar automated checking system, but in the meantime it has to rely on the old equipment--if something breaks it has to be replaced. Up until recently replacement chips have been found in old medical equipment that NASA buys in bulk, but even these reserves are running low now, and the Internet seems to be NASA's last resort.  It is not just the 8086 chips that are required; old circuit boards, 8-inch floppy drives, and a plethora of obsolescent parts are putting a strain on scheduled testing. Auction sites such as eBay and Yahoo! sell just about everything and have been used by NASA for some of the more hard-to-find items. This search can only get harder however, especially with the current space shuttles scheduled to be in service until at least 2010 (and maybe even 2020).   urlLink http://www.geek.com/news/geeknews/2002may/chi20020514011664.htm
Happy Chinese New Year! Bring on the red envelopes. :-)
You know you're in an Australian Summer when:       The best parking space is determined by shade instead of distance.     Hot water comes out of both taps.     You learn that a seat belt buckle makes a pretty good branding iron.     The temperature drops below 35c and you feel a little chilly.     You discover that in February it only takes two fingers to steer your car.     You discover that you can get sunburnt through your car window.     You develop a fear of metal car door handles.     You break a sweat the instant you step outside at 7:30am.     Your biggest bicycle wreck fear is, "What if I get knocked out and end up lying on the pavement and cook to d
