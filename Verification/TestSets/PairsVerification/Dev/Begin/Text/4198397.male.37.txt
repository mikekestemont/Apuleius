KMart isn't the greatest.....but I'm sorry, Wal-Mart sucks.  I call it "Brawl-Mart", since you either have to bully around 1) other shoppers, or 2) large carts of to-be-shelved merchandise, only to complete your three-mile journey to just pick up a gallon of milk and a quart of oil, finding yourself in a long, long line to check-out.  32 registers....five open.  The others would be there for what reason??  In the matter of fairness, the trip to Wal-Mart today was better than normal, in that we had essentially no wait in line (and I saw something most people alive have not...a Wal-Mart cashier at her post WAITING for a customer to come into her line!)  Still, I consider 80 minutes in Wal-Mart to be....about 78 minutes too long.  I love you, Target.  But if you MUST go to Wal-Mart, go to the one in Ashland, Va, just off I-95.  We have one closer to our house, but that one is horrible so we travel a few minutes farther to Ashland.  It's the best of a bad lot....  I didn't do my live draft (was still in bed) so I need to go check out what players are on my fantasy team at Yahoo!.  In closing, a closed-circuit to-do list to myself which can double for your reading convenience as a list of things to come on this here blog....  ---Scruffy ---Obessessive-Compulsive Disorder ---Sleep Apnea ---Maybe, how it feels to walk with both arms dangling by my side... ---A tour of our new elementary school ---sex (just wanted to see if you were paying attention....) ---the all-important upcoming football season, including the NFL, POF (our fantasy league among family and friends), college, and high-school (where I begin my 3rd season as the play-by-play voice of my alma mater, Patrick Henry High School/Ashland, September 10th) ---energizing a church ---energizing a pastor (specifically me) ---feature links to other blogs I've saved under favorites... ---and a chance to win two dollars in cash and/or prizes...hee hee   WISDOM FOR TODAY : Never let the popcorn supply run out at home.  After all, it's why we went to Wal-Mart in the first place....  Rob
Various thoughts on a Friday night after a  long  day at work while listening to the season-finale of my wife's absolute  urlLink favorite show ......  There are some things you can't blog about:  --Your job....that's just common sense, but after tough days one needs a place to decompress....but thanks to worldwide access, this ain't the place.....  --Your ex-girlfriends.....my wife reads, for goodness sakes!! :)  Then there are things on other blogs that are driving me nuts:  --Having to accept a software download just to view the blog.  Sorry, never worth it.  --Music.  Once it starts, I leave.  I'm here to read, not lip-sync.  --Wild colors.  That's an age-issue (don't wear my glasses and I should, especially since I live at a computer screen)...  --The F-word.  All over the place, even from 14 year olds.  Do y'all not know any intelligent a
