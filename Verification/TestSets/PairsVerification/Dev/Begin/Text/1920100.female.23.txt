Hey there I hope everybody is doing well.  A question that has been going through my mind is Why is is easier to obey God than to trust him? Well its easy....because when you obey you do what is expected but when you trust you have to wait, accept and act...even if you don't agree or want to. Sometimes this can be hard because we do not know how to trust God because we are so used to following direction. Also it is easy to obey God when it is to our own convenience (whether it be serving God or not) To trust we have to have faith in God and his control through the good and bad...yes even the bad....it has  a purpose.  What am I saying you might ask. Well as Christians we must have faith that God has control of everything and everyone constantly for his glory and the good of his people. "In him all things hold together." (Colossians 1:17). The bible says that he gives life to everything (Nehemiah 9:6).  God sustains us and cares for us undying.  It is also important to recognize that no one can act outside of God's sovereign will or against it. God's will is invisible and unconprensible.  "we know that God is sovereign, but we also know, that in His sovereignty, God has placed us in a world of sin and suffering from which we have no immunity," and again "God's love...for us, does not place us in a protected position." This is important to know because we must understand that there are going to be bad things we are going to go through but we can be comforted in knowing that God also knows our pains and sympathizes with us. If God exercises his sovereignty in regard to sparrows, most certainly He will exercise it in regard to his children. (Mat 10:29-31). To be anxious means that we are not trusting God. Instead of feeling that way we must run to our Lord as children and pray. Some Christians often are unwilling to accept the fact that God is working, because they don't understand how He is working, they have chosen to substitute the doctrine of Chance for the doctrine of divine providence. Furthemore we must establish our beliefs by the bible and be refreshed by the word not by our own experiences. Eventhough we do not understand God's ways He is sovereingly at work in all our circumstances. It is essential that we realize that eventhough we might get frustrated, be anxious, and suffer we have the calmness and confidence that our suffering is under the control of an all-powerful and all loving God, our suffering has meaning and purpose in God's eternal plan and he brings or allows to come into our lives only that which is for his glory and our good. ....TRUST...TRUST...TRUST....One of the things the Lord is asking us to do.
