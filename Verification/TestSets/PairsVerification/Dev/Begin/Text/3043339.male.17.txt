My Friday night poker game was a mess...well, kind of. It was more...shitty, than expected, to say the least. Per the necessary (I said this on accident on the way home tonight and it kind of sounded good, so it's my new phrase), I'll digress to early Friday. I got out of school at 1:40. I went home, got all my stuff ready for my rugby game, and went to pick up my girlfriend. I left the house at 2:30. If you're a regular reader (rofl, all 4 posts), then you'll know that I'm having some home issues right now. My stepmother called me on my way to my girlfriend's school (she lives 30 minutes away) and asked where my game was and at what time. She informed me that she wasn't going to be there. This made me very happy, as she didn't know I was going to get Hillary and that she would be at my game. Enter rant:   My parents...are weird. Not as weird as my girlfriend's, but I'll save that for another post. When she's at my house, we can be in any room with the doors closed, lights off, they just seem to not care. However, if I'm going to Hillary's house or if we go anywhere when she's here, they give me 20 questions. They never check up on us at my house, so even if we were to have sex, why would I leave the house to go do it? They just have alot of problems, and one of those is realizing that I'm a senior and I'm going to be going to college soon. I know they don't "care about me" and are "worried I'm leaving." If you lived here, you'd understand that. Ever since I moved to Ohio from Louisiana in 7th grade, they've always been like this. I had a bedtime until 1 month into my senior year. I have to call EVERYTIME I go somewhere. It's extremely frustrating, and I hope if there's any parents out there that are reading this, don't do this to your kids. Coming from a kid, it just pisses them off. I can honestly say I've drank once in my life and I hated it. It was stupid, so I don't do it. I'm a rare breed, however. Most of my friends who have controlling parents do anything and everything to get out of the house and go drink and smoke pot. If you let your kids have fun, I promise they'll end up making the right decisions. Controlling parents lead to rebels, but hey, I'm just a kid, how could I know more than an adult.     End rant.  Anyways, we get to my game, I warm up, we win 52-0. I have a great game, having 7 assists and stealing 8 scrums, but I injured my thigh slightly in the first 5 minutes of the game after I kicked the ball and this kid ran right into my thigh. It's still a little tender, but I'll get over it. During my game, my f
