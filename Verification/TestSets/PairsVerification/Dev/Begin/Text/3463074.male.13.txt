I must show my respect to two fellow fellows whom have taught me much with their websites. I have already recruited them and have showed them some of my more in depth plans which i may someday post. Visit my fellow Llama friend at http://www.llama7.blogspot.com/ and my fellow snoof friend at http://www.hamsters4me.blogspot.com/
Well in my various adventures today, i fell inlove with a great gal. I plan on "going steady" as the hip young term is used and perhaps someday even having a cohort in my nefarious plans for the domination of France! You people out there probably think it rediculous that the great genius that i am even has emotions, especially since i am part llama, but in-fact snoofs are quite intelligent and very developed mentally. So, if you are reading this, know my love is for 783742643, written in phone dialect, so if you waste your time figuring it out, good for you. Anyway......... I will continue with my usuall banter tomorrow, though at the moment i must act smitten.
I made an interesting revelation today about the wonderful internet system called "eBay". I have heard many stories of its great amount of ludicrus items, scuch as selling a town, though i had not really belived them until today. I saw for sale a BROKEN camera priced at $26.50. Now, i know you may by stuff on eBay like a used wedding gown but a BROKEN camera? Maybe i am overreacting, but i would like if all you people could write in with your weird eBay stories.
Another idea given to me by my "friend" "Wayne" is a new WEAPON OF MASS DESTRUCTION. It is kind of primative yet seemingly would be very effective. He thought of it when we where discussing the war in Iraq and there WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. He felt all the hubub over Nuclear weapons was irrational along with genetic weapons. He posed the question you all have thought yet simply not expanded on; Why not just use a giant mustard gass filled log? You would simply fly it in and drop it on a hill above what you want to destroy. If anything cuts it in half, you have two slightly less giant logs to deal with AND a field of mustard gas. i am open for suggestions as to how you can make this great destructive item even MORE powerful. Please post comments with your ideas.
Well, i was watching Lord of the Rings: Return of the King woth my "friend" at http://www.llama7.blogspot.com/ when he brought up an interesting idea; what if the nazis joined up with the nazgul? Well, upon thinking about this i realized, they would form the ultimate war machine; both are completly souless and evil. I have decided that i shall start to biogentically culture a DNA strand of a nazgul using the vast amounts of information the LOTR club has about them, along with finding the remains of Adolf Hitler and his nazi hordes. I shall create this freaks of nature over the next 10 years and by the time t
