Hmm well today at school I cleared the house in both games of Poker we played.  No one else would play grid-lock though....  On a lighter note, quiet man Luke was going on about Whale dicks being 12 foot long and basically told the whole room 10 times, oh and also we were informed they have 1 ton balls.  Back to Gridlock, the gambling rules will be up soon when me and Phil think of them and make sure they work well. Have fun with the images of whales you now have in your head...
oooh yeah, card values...  Cards 2-10           =  2-10 respectively. Ace                     =  11 Jack/Queen/King  =  10  suits have no values, although sometimes i want to throttle Dave for saying Hearts > Spades, when surely Spades > Hearts > j00.  >_  -Phil out.  ps Dave is a f00l
so in a nutshell:  •Freeflow(24) is the best thing to get, although... •Abdul(6) beats Freeflow. •Petroc(33) beats Abdul, as long as nobody has Freeflow. •Gridlock(Even sum) is an automatic loss, but only on a three card combo (so someone can win on lets say, 18, with two cards). •Anti-Gridlock[unconfirmed name](Odd sum) with all players means the highest value holder wins.  some other day i will post extra rules for betting on Gridlock, but for now, i'm revising for my Stats exam tomorrow (*coughbullshitcough*)  >.>    -Phil out.
"indeed i am." said the pig....  i'm bored in a free period and i'm stuck next to some wierd girl, who hates me. but now she doesn't O.o so now i am going to post the rules to gridlock™.  Rule 1. You do not talk about gridlock. Rule 2. You  DO NOT   talk about gridlock....  wait a minute, that's fight club... ok.. 1. Each player starts off with 2 cards. 2. Start off left of the dealer. 3. Each player adds up the value of thier cards. 4. The players request to take one card from the dealer, and only one. 5. If the sum of the three cards is an even number, the player gets gridlock and has automatically lost. 6. If the sum of the three cards is an odd number, the player is still in the game. 7. If the sum of the three cards totals up to 24, the player gets Freeflow and has the best chance of winning. 8. If the sum of the three cards is 6 (three 2's), the player gets Abdul, and can beat a Freeflow. 9. If the sum of the three cards is 33 (three Aces), the player gets Petroc, but cannot beat an Freeflow for some reason :-/  10. If everyone has an odd number sum of their cards, the player with the highest value wins. 11. It is optional for a player to choose if he wants a card or not, so you can still win on a 2-card combo... 12. Abdul can only win if another player has a freeflow- then Abdul wins outright, if no one has a freeflow Abdul counts as a pathetic score of 6.  that's about all that needs t
