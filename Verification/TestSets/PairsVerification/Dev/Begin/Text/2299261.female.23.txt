Like Heather, I wanted to sit on this one for awhile...but the more I sit the more I realize that I can't put my finger on what it is exactly that He is showing me or teaching me.  I think it's because I feel like the past two years have been a lesson on hearing His voice.  If you know me at all, you know that I come up with a different idea about the future every five minutes!  My freshman year at FSU I wanted to go to Tacoma, WA to work for World Vision.  Then I wanted to graduate early, intern with Focus on the Family, in Colorado (that was the best sounding one so far!).  Then there was Southern.  Though hindsight, I KNOW that the Lord used that whole thing for my good, I still walked in a direction until He had to literally change my heart away from being so bent towards seminary in Louisville.  Now...here I am home in Orlando, working at the O.G., interning with Student Venture, and still trying desperately to hear His voice clearly.  He said to me this morning, "Leslie, listen to Me, listen to Me, and eat what is good, and your soul WILL delight in the Richest of Fare."  (Isaiah 55:2).  He always brings me back to, "Seek first My kingdom, Les, and My righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you...Do not worry about your life."  (Matthew 6:33, 25).  I've realized again that to even claim this life as my own is foolish.  This is NOT my life.  I belong to Him.  So in that this whole listening thing you'd think would then make some sense...nope.  I still am learning what it means to listen to a God who has given me a Life, that I don't own, that I don't control, that somehow I can still screw up by making poor decisions.  Umm... I want to delight in the Richest of Fare, Jesus.  Shane & Shane sing a song about Him...  Beauty for Ashes A garment of praise for my heaviness Beauty for Ashes Take this heart of stone and make it Yours  I delight myself in the Richest of Fare Trading all that I have for all that is better A garment of praise for my heaviness You ARE the greatest taste,  You ARE the Richest of Fare  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Perhaps He will be exalted if I would just obey Him and not worry about my life.  To rest in His daily grace, to "Just Breathe" and stop striving.  I hope this answers the question...much love from O-town...
This is my little rendition of mad props to Debs via Blogville...  (Insert big fat proud smile here...in fact see my picture on this page...only its a proud smile not an ohmygoshIcan'tbelievehejustdidthatthat'sHILARIOUS smile...but just as big. Promise.)
