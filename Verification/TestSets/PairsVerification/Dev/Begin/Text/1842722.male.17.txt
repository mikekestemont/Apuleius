It's a good question, and one that many people  should  be asking.  However, because a low percentage of poeple actually own an XBox, but love Halo, it's a fairly popular game.  I'm the only one aside from Antilles that actually owns the game, so I thought I'd take the time to post my position on the PC version.  1)   Halo was not designed to be a PC game.   If you take a look at many of the weapons, most of them were designed with the thought of a controller in mind.  For example, the plasma pistol.  If you're got a good trigger finger, it can fire pretty darn fast, and becomes a good mid/low-range weapon and a better resort to combat vehicles.  Place that into a PC, with a mouse.  Now just about anyone can fire it that fast - and it can now be pushed to just about a solid stream of blasts.  That unbalanced the weapons.  More importantly, let's look at the pistol.  Probably the best weapon in the game.  What happens when you add a mouse to the mix?  It becomes disgustingly cheap.  Where a three-shot-head-kill was once a feat, it's now standard. Let's also look at the plasma weapons (pistol, rifle, and ghost).  The most important aspect of these weapons is that they slow your turn/movement speed.   That's what makes them effective.  You can't turn to fight the enemy, and you die.  However, place this in PC, with a mouse.  Oh no!  You are suddenly assailed!  What do you do?  Move the mouse faster.  This becomes especially important in the Ghost vs. Tank scenario.  Where in Xbox, Ghost > Tank, PC has it that Tank > Ghost.  The tank can move fast enough to counter the effect, and destroys the assailant.  Finally, strafing becomes much, much easier to execute.  Where in Xbox a good strafing pattern is a skill to execute, anyone can pick up the game and quickly make a short strafe combine with a long strafe.  2)  The new features ruin the game's previous balance.   Gearbox added a few new things when it ported the XBox to the PC.  Two vehicles:  the Banshee, and the Rocket Warthog and two weapons:  the Flamethrower and the Fuel Rod Gun.  Also included were  new levels.  Both were admirable and everyone wanted these additions.  However, they were poorly implemented.  Let's start with the Banshee.  The addition of a flying vehicle completely changed the game.  The list of complications with this vehicle is enormous.  First and foremost:  it is cheap.  A skilled Banshee pilot can kill  anything .  Whether it's a tank, a sniper, or a rocketeer, it is possible to stay alive.  There are several reasons for this.  First, the Banshee is not 100% sensitive to damage.  The end half of the wings do not react to any damage recieved (even plasma grenades and rockets).  Second, the pilot is also not visible.  Even the best sniper will only have a shot at the arms and feet.  Third, the Banshee has too many aspects of weaponry.  As in Single P
