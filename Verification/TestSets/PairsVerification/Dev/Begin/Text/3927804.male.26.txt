Of course you haven't heard any mention of the issues. Like all facists, an opinion contrary to yours is as audible as a fart in a tornado. We don't need to discuss abortion... we won. It's like listening to a Buffalo Bills fan talk about the missed field goal with this issue.  I understand the whole Kerry by the tractor thing. When your a northern Democrat in the south, they issue you a gun when you cross into Virginia.(just for your own protection.)  Let us turn now to our Commander-and-Chimp, who set all kinds of records at the Retard Olympics by snubbing the NAACP. Is he aware that African-Americans are a RACE of people, not an interest group? There is a possibility here that the electoral college vote may not come down to a state run by his brother this time, and he might actually have to win. Maybe he was on vacation that day and missed the short bus, but as I see it snubbing an entire population of people might not be the best plan. Keep up the good work Georgie.  Here's some fresh Bush Economics from  urlLink dubyaspeak.com  :  Pennsylvania's unemployment rate is 5.1 percent. That's good news for people who are trying to find jobs.                 -- It's not exactly good news until those people have found jobs, Dubya. Smoketown, Pennsylvania, Jul. 9, 2004  This economy of ours is steady and strong. It's steady and strong. It's steady and strong, which means people are going back to work.                -- You are getting very sleepy... Washington, D.C., Jul. 2, 2004  I feel so much better now.
So John Kerry "re-enacted" his "heroic" actions during the Vietnam War so that he could video-tape the actions and save them, for posterity, of course...not for any sort of personal gain.   A new book out, containing quotes from Swift Boat veterans, alleges that Kerry used an super 8mm home video camera, purchased at the base PX.   Some veterans claim that Kerry left Vietnam early not because he received three purple hearts - but because he'd shot enough footage of himself to take home for his future political campaigns.   My question is why. Why take videos of oneself, even recreating the actual events (without putting any sort of spin on it, I'm sure). Why narrate one's own "heroic" actions on video? Why interview oneself about these events? Why masquerade around like an infantryman? For those who may not see the relevance of the last question - please remember that Kerry was in the Navy - not the Marines, not the Army. Kerry wouldn't have known the first thing about being an infantryman.&nbsp; Why attempt to use one's actions of thirty years ago in an attempt to sway voters into believing that you're qualified to be the Commander in Chief? How do the Dem's go from a draft-dodger to a Purple Heart recipient? Why do the recent Dem first-ladies have two stinking last names?   Perhaps we could convince Al-Queda to lay down all the real stuff and just act it all out in a Hollywood s
