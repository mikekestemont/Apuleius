whew, i must admit taht i am totally bored. that's what my computer's for though. on the other hand, i could be kinda nervous. jesus is getting back from houston soon...i think today, but i'm not sure and i'm kinda nervouse about it. i haven't seen him in a year. now i'm sitting here listening to "take another little piece of my heart" by janis joplin. she is totally my hero. she rocked so hardcore. this last week has been pretty weird. michelle and amy have been pretty bitchy to a lot of people now that they have each other. don't worry, i'm not just saying taht cause they ditched me, several people have mentioned to me that they've been doing that lately. the weirdest part is that i don't ahve a huge problem with it. it kinda opens up new oportunities for me. like i use to just hang out with michelle at lunch since i don't have a lot of friends who have 1st lunch with me, but the other day when she was off walking alone, i sat at sophia's table, and then just sat and talked with ian and bethany. it was fun. i guess i should thank her later in life for ditching me. sure ditching people the the number the biggest aspect of un-chillness, but i guess that just makes these people michelle and amy are turning into...well...un-chill. i've been a lot more jack lately than kiki. i was totally kiki last summer. "a tight tye-dye dress she was a psychadelic mess." that sort of thing. i didn't care about a thing and i was totally in love with this random guy i made out with who didn't speak a word of english. it rocked. now i'm kinda more jack. "the freckles in our eyes are mirror images and when we kiss they're perfectly aligned." THAT sort of thing, i'm not worried about it either. i like jack a lot. thanks meghan for the nickname. Jack, hannah Jackson. it makes sense. Europe is more of a Jack country than Mexico is too. i went to san miguel de allende, mexico last yaer when i was Kiki and this summer when i'm Jack, i'm going to Germany and Italy. and the last like 3 years i've been on vacation i've met totally amazing people who changed my life. so maybe that'll happen again. i hope. it rocks. anyway, my computer is tweaking out and my brother has a not so shabby looking friend over. so adios.
now i'm sitting here listening to this song....i'm not sure what its about because i've never listened to the words. it feels like its about being totally content with everything. its called "heaven". i really love it. i was also listening to this postal service song all day and there's this part where he says "tell me am i right that there could be nothing better, than making you my bride and slowly growing old together." i really love it. i don't even get how i was sooo pissed off y
