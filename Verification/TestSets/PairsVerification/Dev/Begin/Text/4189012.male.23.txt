What a day I tell you. Hearty chatting, hearty dinner, hearty puffings, hearty jokes... All ended with a hearty PUKE from shaunni boi. Wat a way to start his 22nd year in his life, throwing up in the presence of gals. First, Ivan took him on to the 'Cai Quan' arena. 1st round ended in a thrashing, shaun finished the whole bottle. Then came a flop, Jon the undisputed champion actually lost to shaun. Helplessly, Jon had to finish his bottle. While Shaun struggles on his 2nd.      Then came the highlight... Shaunni and I were entangled in a 'never say die' challenge. Both were equally good though, at first. However, Kenney got into a sudden good form, thrashing shaunni yet again. Before we can even finish off the round, shaun called for time out. Initially, no one expected anything unusual, then came the birth of Merlion 2004. It came unexpectedly. Shaun puke onto the table, where my bottle was. The worst part was, he tried to contain his puke with his both hands, only to expose the sight of the puke being seived thru his fingers to us. Lily, her sister and friend, were the most disgusted. They have never seen nothing like that before. Well, everything has a virgin try, so I guess shaun took their 'virginity' on this one... *Tsk tsk tsk..       The past birthdays weren't a bit like this. Ivan's one was at Plasma, and we even get to see that waitress, Joanne(FF). Superb nite, hearty too. Then was mine, at red tea house, those drunkards tried to make me 'DOH', but aku strong. Followed by Randy's Kbox session at suntec, everything was peaceful, but not much of atmosphere. Shaunni's one is the funniest, heartiest(Ivan came back), and FLOPPIEST. Watsup with that man shaunni...      Whatever the case, hail the Disney ambassador, Shaun :       - Mickey tatoo on the butt cheek.   - Dumbo tatoo on the dick.   - Goffy's tone of speech.   - Donald's beak when he finishes up Tom Yam Noodles.      Cheers to a evolution to the 'mistake' of LXG, we shall call him 'Disney ambassador' from now.
Today at school was superb. Realised that 'big eyes charisma' is in my maths lecture. Wah, she looks attractive man, with her big eyes, and charismatic smile. What is more appealing is her black top and 'pink overhead bridge'. Super girlly, but goes well with her maturity. When she was walking into the LT, I actually saw her looking at me. This looking over, seeing there thingy is making me ponder.. What issit that these eye contacts are telling me? Then when she turned behind to look at her frens, I was like mesmerised in her looks, then suay suay genna caught for looking at her. ~Haiz, that moment lasted mahjiam one full minute. Somehow, I think her frend beside her keep spying over, c
