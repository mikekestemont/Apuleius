As far as I'm concerned the last ones standing should have been Fantasia Barrino, Jennifer Hudson and LaToya London. America should  NEVER  pick a person to go on because of race, creed or culture, let alone because they come from their local area! A person should be picked on their talent, stage presence and charisma! Ending word....  Fantasia!
At last week's mass our pastor talked about the receiving of communion. It was his belief that no one be denied that Holy Sacrament. He said it is not for him to judge, that is between the receiver of Communion and their maker. It seems the Catholic Churches Bishops don't all agree. Which is a shame. They should take heed from the Lord's actions for he never turned away a sinner. He made comment that they (sinners) needed him more than the non-sinner. Isn't that the truth, you don't treat the healthy you treat the sick. Now I know there are many who are feeling a bit aggressive at the Catholic Church right now. Mine is not against the Church itself but those who have not done right by the Church. Whether they are the committer of the sin or they are the ones who didn't take those who sinned (against others) out of the public workings! In my eyes both have sinned against humanity. But the Church as a whole, with so many millions of good people in association with it are not at fault. I don't agree with everything the Catholic Church says. I cannot abide to what doesn't sit true in my heart. The Catholic Church has to many times been a judge and this is something Jesus tell us not to do. I don't believe in abortion, but it is not for me to vote in a law, to what I believe is between a woman and her maker. For it  IS  her body to do what she wishes with. I am not to judge. The Catholic Church would totally disagree with me on this. What can I say, I'm "pro choice", and I  don't  believe in abortion, but that decision is for myself! I go to the Catholic Church because it was the religion I was raised on, so I am comfortable with the mass. But I believe any truly Christian service is fine, for I'm a Christian, that happens to go to a catholic Church. The Lord didn't start Christianity as many different sects. If you follow the Lord all you can be is Christian. Names are just labels, to be Christian is to follow Jesus!
How can people be racist, still in this day & age. If you think about it logically, being a racist isn't really too smart. You shouldn't be discriminating because some has more or less pigment in their skin and the texure and curl or lack of it is different from your own or your loved ones. Or because they might be a man or woman. That's like saying all purple velvet is good and all blue velvet is bad. Sounds pretty dumb d
