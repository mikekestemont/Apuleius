I have recieved the highest honor a blogger could ask for:  recognition by another blogger via a link to my blog on theirs.  Friend, reader, and fellow blogger: I THANK YOU.     I tried responding in kind, but I don't know how to add a links portion to my blog yet.  As soon as I do, I'll list all the blogs I enjoy plus some other cool stuff.   oh, and there's one who is not ready for her blog to become quite so public, so I won't link it here until she gives me the OK.   YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE!     Rain, rain, rain again today.  I like rain, had to work in it all morning and was soaked to my skivvies by 10 am, but kept my spirits up by singing the saturday night bath song ("splish splash, I was takin' a bath....") and by realizing there wasn't a thing I could do about it until we finished and I had time to change.     And big news!   Our first chick has pipped!  It's to be delivered to its new parents this afternoon, since the hatcher is just a machine and doesn't make for very good parenting.  Several of our future chicks will be hand-reared, but we're all very excited, and I'm sure Berta and Ernie, one of our sandhill pairs and soon-to-be-parents, will do a bang-up job.  It'll help that it's not their first time.  I may explain more about how we go about hatching and raising chicks later, but I don't want to post too much work-related stuff in order to protect myself, my co-workers, and the Foundation.  I don't think I've said anything yet that one couldn't find out by visiting and taking a tour, but just in case.    SO....back to Freud and Lewis.  Despite copious note taking, I really can't do  The Question Of God  justice here without much longer entries and time commitments that I can't make at present, so if anything I've said interests you I urge you to read it for yourself.  On the question of conscience and the idea of a universal moral law (i.e. Natural Law, Tao, First Principles of Practical Reason, Traditional Morality, a sense of right and wrong, etc.) Freud claimed morals came from internalized rules that parents instilled, and that guilt is inherited from our primordal ancestors who killed their "totem-father"-the dominant male who controlled each people group-a theory he quickly rescinded on after publishing it.  He further stated that the scientific method is the sole road to fact-finding, and that if people were simply educated and taught that acting morally (not killing, stealing, etc.) is in their best interest, they will act accordingly (this was before the very educated Nazis tried to kill off Freud and other Jews).  He believed equating morals with religion was dangerous because as people become educated they throw off religion, and would likewise throw off morals.  However, as with every other spiritually related question addressed so far, Freud waffled continually on the subject and at times disagreed with himself entirely, but refused the a
