will be going for my jabs today.  goodness it's going to be 5 of them at least! and i can't remember all of them.. know i am going to get Yellow Fever, Hep A, Tenatus, Malaria, and prob Rabies if the doctor has his way.  ouch!  mom was like 'u are getting more jabs now than when u left for india. so that place is not safer than india ah?' hmmm... sounds so logical! but maybe it's because i am leaving for 2 whole years at least, that's why i need more jabs.  but rabies? doc's argument is 'brazil has wild animals'.   i thot i am staying in the city?! or what animals is he talking about, i wonder... maybe i should get pepper spray or something (dumbaids, if you are reading this, this is the present u owe me!!!). think animals (or not) would be scared of it right?  hmm, being a vegetarian will put me in greater danger - the animals will not see me as a threat. so i should start eating meat and let the animals see how i slice the flesh and chew it slowly in my mouth as a warning to them. let them know i am a carnivore!  okok, talking crap. it's a beautiful day in SG, let me enjoy it before i wince in pain.
L.O.V.E.  what did u think it was? ;op  it's one of the most difficult word to apply, i realise.   things appear so wonderful when u are falling in love with a guy whom u think is the best on earth. the birds sing (not chirping irritably), the flowers bloom (not attracting bees and scaring people) and food taste better (even those canteens in industrial areas).  your heart skips many a beat when you see HIM. your breath quickens and you start talking in a giggly voice. you tell HIM little things (there's a cockroach in the office today!) and you do little things for HIM (sending him inspiring quotes everyday).  then as u embark on a journey of discovery... clouds of doubt start hovering over. why doesn't HE do this or that? why does He do this or that? why does HE behaves like this or that? am i bothering HIM with all the silly things i have done? am i irritating? if not, why doesn't HE reciprocate or show some indication at all? does HE really like me, let alone LOVE me? is this a mistake? Maybe, just maybe, the relationship was never meant to be in the beginning.  birds wake u up early in the morning chirping irritatingly (don't u wish to just shoot them off the tree). bees buzz dangerously close to u as they fly around the flowers in the garden (insecticide pls). and food is just tasteless, if lucky. else it's shit on ur plate (will someone do everybody a favour and fire the chef).  perhaps it is time to let go when ur consciousness are all about the pain and tears start flowing. it was good while it lasted. but another question p
