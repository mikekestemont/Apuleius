About two weeks ago, on June 21, a phone call from my mom woke me up at around 7 in the morning.  Sounding very calm and composed, she told me that a sheriff and a handful of cops were downstairs, about to take away my car.  Trying to sound very cool myself, all I could say was “Ha? Anong nangyari??”    Ok, ok, sounds melodramatic right? The story of my car has so many twists and turns, sometimes it confuses even me.  My sister got it via car loan from her former employer (I will not name names lest I be sued for libel) about three or four years ago.  It’s a 1997 Toyota Camry, 2.2 liters, grey, automatic, leather seats, climate control, woodgrain paneling, the works.  At that time, I was driving a beat-up (my fault) 323 Mazda Familia, which had survived a major accident that almost sent it to car heaven.    On the latter part of 2002, my sister bought a van to keep up with her growing family.  Hence, the decision to hand me down the Camry, and I said goodbye to my Mazda forever.  Considering that my parents were paying a minimal amount and that it IS one hell of a car, I accepted it despite the fact that my sister had gotten embroiled in a legal battle against her employer, with the Camry right smack in the middle of it.  Counting on the merits of my sister’s case, I was thrilled at the prospect of having a luxury car which I could never afford to buy on my own.    For one and a half years, I cruised the streets of Manila in the Camry.  My boyfriend called it a “power car”, and rightfully so.  In it, going through potholes and humps felt like floating.  It hovered over the ground and was always, always stable – even at speeds over 100 kmh.  I would clean it myself (a stark contrast to earlier days when I would leave all “car business” to our maid or driver, all I did was drive).  I would sweat weekends giving it a carwash and rubbing off dirt from its leather seats.  But alas, my love affair with the Camry abruptly ended on that fateful day.     Going back to the phone conversation with my mom -- a few more reassuring words from her and my dad and it was over.  I was off to the garage.  It seems that my sister’s former bosses know how to spring a surprise – and they chose to do it in style, with cops and public officers crowding around our gates.  As if I’d attempt to do a Lara Croft or something, bring out the heavy guns, and shoot at everyone in sight just for a car.  Tsk, tsk, if only I could take a picture of all those cops and officers who went there undoubtedly without need of prodding, but with a few thousand pesos safely tucked in their wallets.   Greasing palms, after all, is nothing new and has proven to be the swiftest and most r
