Yesterday I did something a bit crazy.  I followed those silly text books about setting goals, and I did.  This is a huge step for me.  I'm just generally too lazy to actually do all the work involved in setting a goal.  But  yesterday I did it.  My goal was to save as much money as I possibly could between now and August 13th, my moving date, to buy new bedroom furniture.  My current bedroom furniture I've had since I was five years old. It's white, and made for a little girl...its time to grow up and get some grown up furniture.  And a bed thats not too short for me! So I sat down and wrote a budget for myself and created reasonable spending limits for myself.  And then after work I went to Crate & Barrell to look at all their insanely expensive furniture to motivate myself to save.  Looking at their prices made me go "holy crap! i can't afford furniture! i can't spend a dime!"  Though, I know I'll get furniture somewhere thats actually reasonably priced, it helped give me something to look forward to.  Flipping through Ikea's website helped too.  So wish me luck, and hopefully by the time I move in August I'll have a whole bedroom to live in in my new apartment!
Last night I saw "The Chronicles of Riddick" in the theatre, this follows up seeing "Pitch Black" last week.  I have to say, I really enjoyed both movies.    Naturally they're not award-winning films, but they're very creative, and interesting.  If you're interested in seeing Science Fiction & Action, these are both great films.  Don't expect them to be believable, thats why their sci fi action flicks, but they're still great.  I also would reccommend seeing Pitch Black before you see Chronicles just because you know a bit more before going into Chronicles - though its not completely necessary.  It just helps a little.  Next up - I want to see Fahrenheit 9/11.
This weekend I'm off to spend a day and a half with Daddy in Connecticut.  I lived in Connecticut for about five years when I was in elementary school, and I loved it there.  It's been a few yaers since I've been back there, and I'm looking forward to spending the weekend there again.  Especially since its just me and Daddy.  Of course, we're driving up in Daddy's bright yellow with black checkered roof MINI which just makes it even more fun.  In other news, I also have been dubbed at work today as someone not to cross.  I really can't figure out what took them so long to figure it out, but my co-worker today said "I've learned, Lauren is not someone to piss off."  I'm so proud that they've learned this.  Someone sent me a really asshole email yesterday and I wrote up a super sarcastic response refering to the "Common Sense" policy which can be found in the Finance Library on the second floor.  I didn't send the email to the jerkface that wrote it, but I d
