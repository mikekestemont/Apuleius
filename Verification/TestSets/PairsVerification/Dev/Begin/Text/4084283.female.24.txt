I guess this is an  outrageous  way to keep a journal but doesn't hurt rite?...&nbsp; EVeryday I go to school and the same thing happens.&nbsp; The kids stay so HYPER n I end up wif a major head pain!&nbsp; Do I take multivitamin s pescribed by a CL colleague?&nbsp;     &nbsp;  However, apart from that,... I&nbsp; was telling a close fren in school that I really do regret being too hard on my kids.&nbsp; No homeworks,  OUT  they go.&nbsp; Refuse to answer my interrogation,  OUT  they go.&nbsp; Jumping up and down in my class,  OUT  they go.&nbsp; He he... we are getting sadistic aren't we?   I really gotta change cos this attitude of mine s really draining even me out.&nbsp; Lucky for me, my kids - 35 of em, are ever so outrageously cute! They keep me fit, fun and fab!    &nbsp;  I miss my fiance.&nbsp; I can't wait to meet him tomorrow.&nbsp; I hope he fetches me from school.&nbsp; Oh by the way, oral exams for P6 so... well... duty calls...    &nbsp;  Hi to all bloggers... stay fit and strong my frens... its FRIDAY!!
Isn't it funny how some people behave?  THe argumentative fools, the stuck up weirdos and everything else in between?   Glad that my frens are not one of them.      For the past two days, I've been too tired.  Yesterday I tried to return home early, but remembered that I had to apply for a new ATM.  I'm glad I did.  THe new POSB atm was so FAB!!  Blue colour without wave patterns! Like credit card like tat!! ;]  Action mah!  Credit card is so not in my league so have to settle for a normal ATM card!  I learnt Table Tennis for the second time yesterday! Fun fun fun!  But whenever it was my turn, the ping pong ball will always go WILD! Mr Zirk had to play catch with the itsy bitsy teeny weeny ball!  Such fun!  Mr Zirk has been so supportive and loving eversince the demise of my beloved Anna Sui.  Well some things can't be helped.   "Take this as a learning experience." said Sue and Mr Zirk.  Tears won't reverse what had happened.  Such a pity.  Now, if only I can muster up the courage to tell my mum about this!  She will absolutely FLIP! ... :'[  Well... today is FRIDAY! Another weekend awaiting!  Tomorrow PSLE oral again... then kickboxing session with the pupil trainers!.... I hope they won't torture us for long.... I need to get out and get some FRESH air.... Will be watching Alien vs Predatore....  Well... alls well that ends well.... Such a hectic fun week! ... Stay fit and fun always!  Gosh I feel so tired like want to collapse today!!
