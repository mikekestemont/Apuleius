I actually had fun at the wedding. My dad introduced me to all the people he works with and I heard a lot of stories about my dad and what my dad tells them about me. lol It was rather interesting. Then jokingly I asked my dad to get me a glass of wine, well I didn't think he would, but to my surprise when he came back he had the big glass of wine...Well, as the reception went on these waiter guys kept coming around to fill up the glass...I really didn't notice them doing it, they just sorta did it when I wasn't looking. Well after 3 big glasses of wine and 2 glasses of champain...I got a little tipsy...My dad and his work buddies were laughing at me because I was stumbling around and had trouble keeping my head up...and yeah...Now the whole point of me being there was to talk to a recruiter from Westpoint.

O well, I'm gonna go...Catch yall later!

THIS THING IS DRIVING MY CRAZY! Now I cant go to sleep at all because we have a wedding to go to in about and hour. O well, hopefully we will leave right after the thing and not go to the reception. I really need some sleep. I hate not being able to sleep.   On to a new subject...For the past few weeks my internet in my room hasn't been working and we have tried and tried to figure out what was wrong with the damn thing! We bought a new Ethernet Card for it and took it to a computer place and nothing would seem to work...Well at 9 a computer guy from SBC came over (that's why I had to get up) and he told us that it was the damn portal. We would have never figured that shit out. We would still probably be looking for the damn thing if he hadn't come out. O well, the fact is the c
