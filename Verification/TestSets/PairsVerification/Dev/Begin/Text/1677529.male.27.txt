hahahahahahahaha...MS is so vulnerable to worms and viruses,  urlLink they run linux web servers instead of their own!     but they're not alone...according to  urlLink this post on slashdot , "It may be a case of 'do as we say, not as we do' over at the Santa Cruz Operation. The Netcraft statistics meter says that for the last year, SCO's web site has been served by Apache on Linux. Indeed, it's been more than a year since the site was ever served from a SCO Unix machine. So what is the possible reason for this? Your humble author suggests that SCO found themselves requiring a multithreaded web server, and as SCO UNIX is based on an ancient version of The UNIX spec it just couldn't cope ;-)."
TEST RESCHEDULED FOR FRIDAY!!!  too many other tests scheduled for Thursday, so we'll do Current Events Thursday and test Friday.  sorry for any confusion, but I'm working for YOU!  (sounds like a politician...vote Maynard!)   UNIX/Linux history  ok, in a hurry, here's the low-down... Kent Thompson and Dennis Ritchie started work at Bell Labs in 1966 and 1967 (respectively).  They worked on the Multics project, on which the Unix project was based.  1st Unix: 1969.  DR wrote the C language (KT wrote B), and by 1973,  Unix was rewritten in C, kernel and all.  AT&T released Unix source to academia around 1974.  One of the most prominent Unix versions to come from that release was BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution).  Ethernet came along in 1976 thanks to Xerox, and Unix systems were (and are) the foundation for the Internet.  By 1982, AT&T was able to sell Unix commercially.   Major Unix vendors:  Sun Solaris, IBM AIX, HP-UX, SCO...   RMS and Free Software  1971--Richard M. Stallman hacking away at MIT AI lab.  Xerox gave them a printer, but no source code for it.  Infuriated by this refusal, RMS went on to lead the push for free software, creating the GNU Project (1983), the Free Software Foundation (1985), and the GNU General Public License (GPL, v. 1.0, 1989).   Linux  Linus Torvalds was a student in Finland.  In 1991, he started working on Linux, his own version of the Minix kernel.  He started it as a hobby, not expecting it to be "big and professional like gnu."  RMS was (and still is) working on the GNU HURD kernel, which has yet to reach v. 1.0 to this day.  Fortunately, the Linux kernel came along and filled the HURD gap, even though Linus never envisioned it that way.  In 1992, Linux and GNU started playing nicely together (technically, Linux is really GNU/Linux), and by 1994, v. 1.0 of the Linux kernel was released.  (Today, the current stable kernel is 2.4, and 2.6 is expected to come out later this year.)  In 1996, Tux became the official mascot of Linux (see the Links section of the blog for an article with all the details of Tux's birth and adoption).  By 1998,seven years after its announment and 4 years after v. 1.0, Linus was on the cover of Forbes magazine!  Not bad for "
