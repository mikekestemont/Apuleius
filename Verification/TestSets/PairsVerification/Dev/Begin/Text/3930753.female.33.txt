&nbsp; I have to believe everything happens for a reason and that if you keep your eyes open and have faith when a door closes a window will open.&nbsp; It might take longer than you want or be a different window than you thought, but something good will come.&nbsp; With this belief in my heart my daily vigil of support for Mark has begun.   &nbsp; He is still hurt and upset from the lay off.&nbsp; He feels betrayed and often states he feels like a loser.&nbsp; He is not in any way a loser, but the feeling are natural.&nbsp; Two days ago he went for what he thought was an interview for the Sprint in-bound call center.&nbsp; Mark has past call- center experience and thought with that he would get a decent offer.&nbsp; When he arrived he realized it was a cattle call.&nbsp; He spoke with the HR person and the basically informed him he would get the base pay to start.&nbsp; He would also have to take tests and sit with everyone else who applied and had no experience.&nbsp; Needless to say his pride was hurt.   &nbsp; I have been talking to Mark about going back to school long before his lay off.&nbsp; I often asked him what he would like to be.&nbsp; He had expressed an interest in the radiology field.&nbsp; Security is easier to come by in medical related fields. Going back to school is a big step for Mark.&nbsp; It means concentrated focus for several years in a field of study he knows little about.&nbsp; Starting over in mid-life and depending on someone else to financial support him.&nbsp; Monday we will going to Pima College.&nbsp; A private college that offers classes in radiology, vet tech medicine, respiratory&nbsp;therapy and other similar fields.&nbsp; If he decides this is something he wants to do we will investigate financial aid and when he should start.&nbsp; The radiology program is 2 years full time with no breaks.&nbsp; Mark is excited and scared.&nbsp; I know he can do anything he wants to.&nbsp; Now just get him to believe that.   &nbsp;
Mark went to work this morning at 7am like normal.&nbsp; He called me at 9am and asked me to bring him some shorts since he was working in the warehouse and it was hot.&nbsp; He called again at 10:45 to tell me that he had just been laid off.  &nbsp;  The manger of his department, who had turned in his&nbsp;resignation and 2 weeks notice&nbsp;the week before, came down from Denver to tell him that the Albuquerque office was being closed and he was no longer employee as of now.&nbsp; After 12 years of work and never taking sick leave.....bye, see ya and don't let the door hit you on the way out.&nbsp; Mark was under the impression from&nbsp;the fit Mike, his friend&nbsp;(for 30 years) and co-worker threw that both of them had been laid off.&nbsp; It's a two man office.&nbsp; It seems that since going public the company stock is in the crapper.&nbsp; I assume to save money all account will be handled t
