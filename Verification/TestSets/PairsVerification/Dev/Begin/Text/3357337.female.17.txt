as of this writing i have exactly 11 days before another school year officially kicks off. and that schoolyear my friends isnt just something.  coz in about eleven days, i am a college student. a freshman in a university.  i came from a catholic all-girls school and thats where all this drama is coming from.  the university is conveniently(im being sarcastic here) 2 hours away from where i live.  and im going to commute after my first week.  maybe this is just jitters..or im just freaking out. ..  but i guess its not all baaadd. i got in the course i want. i'll be majoring in communication arts. ill be studying the subjects of my dreams. so i guess ill be fine. yeah, ill be fine.
Survivor isnt reality tv.  Spongebob is.  Spongebob works in a diner and has a selfish,self-centered crab for a boss. He works there despite the fact that he knows that most of the time his boss isnt up for any good. All these, well..because he has no choice and he enjoys cooking those crabby patties.   Spongebob has an egoistic colleague who acts as if he owns the place. Although Spongebob is the one who cooks the food that makes the diner successful, he treats Spongebob like shit. Talk about being insecure.  Spongebob has a stupid friend starfish who he has to deal with every single day. Spongebob has to endure idiocy at its best and still keep his sanity.   These are the things that every person, at any point in their screwed up lives, experience. This is reality personified in a cartoon.   And yeah, when u get stranded in an island, u dont get followed by a camera and u try to help the other people who are stranded too to survive. Because ur human, and that is just how it goes...how real life goes.
i finally have my own blog! hehe. i think this is cool, sharing my thoughts-my random thoughts-with the world..at least as far as the world wide web is concerned. :)  just recently, i read the book entitled "i kissed dating goodbye" by joshua harris. its a great book and it opened my eyes about relationships. there were some parts that i could not relate to though coz its about marriage and stuff like that. im just turning 17! but i have to say that i indeed kissed dating goodbye..at least for now.
answer: by backstabbing.  i hope some will be informed that the world isnt round for nothing. u can't do anything that isnt goin to come back to you and get u at ur rear.   there are a lot of things goin on in our world- children starving, women are being abused, HIV is fast spreading, our economy on the ground, terrorism, obesity..and the list goes on and on... and what do some people care about? bring others down and talk nasty things behind their backs.  i hope and pray karmic forces will go gentle on you, and i hope and pray i can forgive you too. and while im at it..here i
