I just read Elena's thing in my guestbook, again. Me and her have such good times together. She is the coolest girl I know. I really hope she comes to Sprague next year. I wish we could talk to each other more often. I miss her at Judson, even though we really didn't hang out until after I left that place. The fair was so awesome. So was the time we hung out all day, with yea the little ball of light. It was just one day, but I swear that made me feel like we've known each other for like ever. Good times with righty.  Happy new year everyone
So, I heard some things I guess Hilary said about me today. If they're true or not, we'll find out later. I'm leaning towards truth, because this is the second time I've heard the same things from someone else. I'm pretty well angry about it. It's stupid how she's still going on about all this shit on, "Oh our relationship was stupid" and "I never liked him to being with." Well good for you if that's how you feel. Thanks for lying to me over and over again. Thanks for lying to cover up more lies. Thanks for totally leading me on, and thanks for being a dishonest waste of time. I had feelings for you, real feelings for you. I guess you don't know what that means. I thought I was a nice guy, but that's only up to a point. Just because I'm nice, doesn't mean I'll take in everything forever with a smile. You crossed the line. No one has done that for a long time. I tried to be everything for you, but you didn't even give me a thanks. All you gave me was a slap in the face.  I hope you get my email, and I hope you can find someone good enough for you so you can be satisfied. After all, you deserve it.                    Chris
Today I hung out with Tiara and Brittany. It was Tiara's birthday.  Happy 14th birthday Tiara. We hung out and played in the snow and stuff. It was a great day. I had a lot of fun. One of those times where I actually brought out my inner kidness.  Whew, I miss them. It's gonna be icy tomorrow. I hope I can get in contact with Jordan and finally get my amp. I wanna write a song called, "Have you seen my Tiara?" inspired by her little sister's shirt. lol.
It's late. I get weird when it's late. Like my thought process and stuff. If someone like me was talking to me right now, I'd be freaked. I wrote some poetry tonight. They were a continuation of a couple thoughts I had the other night. They're about Hilary. I'm over her, but the feeling is still there, and I guess it makes for good, sincere, writing.  Oh yea, it's snowing. What a blast. It better continue during school. yaya
I finished reading Boy's Life this morning. I stayed up until 4:30 am r
