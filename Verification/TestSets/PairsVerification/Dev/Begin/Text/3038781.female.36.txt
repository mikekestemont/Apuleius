Aside from it being Latoya's breast, why do you think a peek of it remains a "tempest in a c-cup" [Matt Lauer,  Today Show  , Today.] ?   What is  it  about a women's breast that so many find obscene?  They can't be inherently obscene or you would have to think that God was a bit of a voyeur. In fact, if I remember right one of the first signs of sin was that Adam and Eve covered up.   Supposedly breasts are covered up because they're sexual organs; but, to my memory neither men's nor women's breasts are essential to sex... only just one of  the perks.   I'll admit that it plays a part in rearing the offspring, but that doesn't seem to be the issue because most places don't consider nursing an obscene act.  If it's not the function, then what is it? The size? The shape? No, otherwise sumo wrestlers and heavy guys etc couldn't go topless but flat chested women could... so it comes back down to the obvious...   They're obscene because the certain people (who shall remain nameless) think of them in conjunction with obscene acts... My, my such dirty minds...   Now, I won't say who they are; but, next time you hear someone complaining about Latoya's or any other set being obscene -- you'll know who I'm talking about.

Maybe it's been a really rough week. But, I've had those before so this doesn't seem like the most resonable answer.   Well whereever it's been. I'm back. I think.  But, here's another question. How can you really tell if you're back or still there thinking your back? And, why can't you remember where you go when you werent here. It's the zoned out thing just without the drugs.   Oh by the way, anyone out there who's into standing up for others/ noble causes/lost causes... there's a couple of sites set up to save the WB show   Angel.    urlLink www.savingangel.com  and  urlLink savingangel.org   They've even connected to a few decent rallies and will be having a rally tomorrow.

How can they say that?   Reading an  urlLink AP story  about the rescue attempts to save a right whale named Kingfisher, it amazed me to read some of the comments made in the article by both the scientists and the author William L Holmes.   For instance:  "We're cautiously  optimistic  about it," said Kent Laborde, a spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration." ...  While describing Kingfisher's plight [that the approximately "250 feet of half-inch rope wrap[ped around] the animal's body, cutting into its skin and possibly into its bone... hindering its ability to swim lines around... and will continue to tighten as it grows, killing the a
