sorry about the no post yesterday i was pretty busy i had a hectic day and i went to be early today was kinda cool though i went tothe job centre and found a cool job which sounds ideal for me im just waiting for the call i hope to god i get this one it sound so cool. im feeling pretty tired today and i dont know why but im sure i will live.
well i had my interview today and i got the job but its only 16 hours per week so i dont know if i can live off that plus they want me to have injections (ugh) and the latest rumour is victoria beckham is wanting to divorce david for attending the largest orgie in the world he apparently fucked 3/4 of the uk in 120 minutes hahaha (another bad joke)well see you all soon jack was 2 today bless his little cotton socks.
well today was a pretty uneventful day (sundays normally are) i got up at 09:30 am went online searched for some music to download did that watched a few films went for a kick about with me little nephiew in the back got some photos too which was cool i may post some at a later date. i got a job interview tomorrow so wish me luck.
my sister come and visited me today she bought my niece and nephiew with her its great to see tham all again things have been pretty intense the past few years with her but now i feel as thought things are improving greatly i missed the little ones so much jack is growing up so fast he is 2 on monday and alex is 8 soon too shes female so she will mature quicker than jack im sure. hope all my mates are good. me my self i feel a little odd about something but when i figure it out im sure ill sort it right away. oh incase you were worried about daves pc its sorted now i had an old one doing nothing i replaced it with that hes chuffed now coz it runs alot of games his old one never his old one didnt run windows xp let alone a game hehe now he runs anything he wants so my job is done.
