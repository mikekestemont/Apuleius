So, George Bush is still an idiot I suppose..... I mean how f*cking clever can one man be. He fooled all the terrorists and Millitia men by having the transfer of power given to Iraq in the middle of the night last night...... So I give Mr. Bush the First Ever  ' Cap'N Conservative Smartest Man Alive Award '.... But you know what, Big Media doesn't care, NOOOOOOOOOO , they just want to suck Michael Moore's big Hog Ass some more..... I'm listening to Glenn Beck right now talking about somebody's experience who went to go see Fahrenheit 9/11 over the weekend and how there were blatant lies such as Moore saying at the beginning of the movie ' I nevery major recount Gore won the Presidential Election '.... That should make one wanna walk out of the film at the beginning for having a bold face lie perpetrated at the beginning of a 'Documentary '... But then again I'm asking Liberals to use there brain here. I remember when I was younger, I used to like Moore and his tv shows ' TV Nation ' and ' The Awful Truth ' but then I found out his ' documentaries ' were nothing more than acted out personal opinion and vision. And Michael Moore is not fat, He's like that Blob of ectoplasm in Ghostbusters 2, remember when you yelled at it and showed hatred toward it, it grew bigger??? Well that's what has happened to more, he's just like the pink blob and his girth keeps on getting bigger and bigger with all the hate he instills about America and for America. ( Comment : The Producers of this Website wish to tell the readers that the views of CapnConservatives are his views and his views alone, if any ectoplasmic blob of slime was offended by being compared to Michael Moore, we are sorry and we agree with your complaints ). It's a good thing Spiderman 2 comes out on Wednesday, that way this film will be forgotten very soon. I bet Michael Moore smells like a weird cheese of some sort. I mean with his girth and huski-ness it would be hard to get in between most of his fat rolls when he showers, if he showers??? And the dead fat skin cells would just fester in the sweltering heat generated by his fat rolls rubbing against each other when he barely breathes, all sorts of bacteria forming and coming to life. Maybe he takes a shower in Grease and someone needs to buy him one, JUST ONE, F*CKING HAT TO FIT HIS BULBOUS HEAD..... I seriously think Moore just needs to get laid, once...... I swear to God if he gets laid once, his next documentary will be about how Flowers broom in the springtime and love is eternal..... Of course finding a VICTIM like that is like trying to get Parents to send there kids to Neverland Ranch for a sleepover party.        I saw John Kerry on TV today and the guy just looks like he s
