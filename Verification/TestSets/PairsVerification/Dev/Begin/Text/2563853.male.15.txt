Sorry I didn't get to write yesterday, it was a busy day.  I had a dentist appointment and then had to run errands and didn't get to write to the blog or do much of anything.  Well anyway my life is pretty exciting, probably because it is New Years Eve.  I am also going to clean out the home office today and do some organizing for my mom.  I did sleep in late today though.  I got up at 10:30!  That may not be late for you, but for me that is vvvvveryyyyyyyyy late!!!Nothing much has happened in the community so not much to say there.  I am so happy that I don't have to start school back for another week!  My sister has to start back on Monday.  Of course she deserves it.  I love getting to sleep in late and not have to worry about tests, homework, teachers, quizzes, FINALS!  But I know that I will  have to go back sometime, but until then it is party time :)  I am also happy because my mother got her 4-runner back and we no longer have to ride in the company car, thankgoodness.  Also be prepared for some changes in my website design.  I am looking for a whole new look.  Dont know when it will change, but it will.  If you know of any place to find or have suggestions yourself for backgrounds, feel free to e-mail them to me.
Man today started out early, I had to get up at 6:30 :p !  Now usually that wouldn't be considered early for me, but with Christmas break happening I have gotten lazy and love to sleep in later that I would if school was in session.  The reason that I had to get up so early was that my parents, didn't have to work today and my mother's 4-runner needed repair so we had to take it to the company today.  So until we get the 4-runner back, we have to drive one of the company that my mom works for cars.  It is so much different than what I am used to.  More bad news also, McDonalds had a fire and are closed for a few days.  So it isn't that bad of news, but in this small town this is something.  At least we still have another McDonalds on the other end of town.  Everything is crazy with people returning gifts and everything.  We went to the store this morning after we dropped off the 4-runner and the shelves were bare, there was nothing much left to sale.  I considered that stop a waste of my time.    And when I get home, there is nothing on TV and I can't think of anything to do on the internet, so just as every other day in my life, it is a boring and plain day.  Oh well, life moves on.  Ta-Ta for now, really to tell you the truth until tomorrow.  And remember "Today is the tomorrow that we worried about yesterday"  PS^2:  I also may start just p
