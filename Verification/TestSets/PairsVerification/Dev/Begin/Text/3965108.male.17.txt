Hello again,   As i doubt i have any faithful readers out side of those that know me i'll dispense with the apologies for not posting in almost a week.   I've been in a little town in Idaho called Mountian Home. On the Air Force base to be exact. I was visiting family up there and truth be told i had a blast. My uncle is a Lt. Col up there and he just got himself a new command. That's why we were up there. I got to see an active duty F-15 whle it was still on the flight line. Seeing them in a museum is one thing but when you have other F-15's and F-16's taking off less than a hundred yards from you it's a whole new experiance. The other cool thing was that i got to see the Charlie Daniles Band play at the base. i guess if any one out there has ever heard "The devil went down to Georgia" you can guess what that was like.   Amber took another pregnancy test and it came up negative to. Next i see her i'm going to buy her one of those E.P.T. things for her to take when she gets home in about 10 days. Hopefully it'll say the same thing.   My big sister Sara and my Girl freind Megan have been hanging out together. it seems like i created my own worst nightmare when suggested Sara help Meg with her mom. Both f them know things about me now that neither should. It's going to be one hell of a time when i go back for a while in December.If it were possible i'd say i was a little scared.   While in Idaho i was taching some of my family to DDR. (Dance Dance Revolution) For only having a crappy pad to use they did well. My cousin jason got really into it prety fast and got pretty good for only having a week to play. My little cousin Ryan is like 7 and he can already do Max Unlimited on beginner. He's not aceing it but that's still something.   Well that's pretty much all i have to say today. I have the next couple of days off so if i think of anything you can bet it'll be here.   7-31-04
hello all,   I have enabled comments on this blog so if any one out there wants to say something to me feel free. You don't have to sign up any more.   Today is back to work. I found it exremely hard to get up. But doesn't every one on Monday?   I have great news. I now know for a fact I'm not going to be a daddy. Let's just say that there is one thing that proves with out a doubt that a girl isn't pregnant and it happened. I'll leave it at that.   My worries as of recently however still reside around one person. My former brother Julian. I say former because well....things happened with his girl friend Cora while he was in jail once. B
