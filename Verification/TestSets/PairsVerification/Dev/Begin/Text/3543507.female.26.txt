urlLink     Baz looking picturesque in the old witches village in Western Liguria&nbsp; urlLink   &nbsp; urlLink We hired a car and drove down west of Genova .&nbsp; First we stopped off at Finale Liguria and sat on the beach and had a wander.&nbsp; We tried to get a hotel but it was far too busy.&nbsp; So failing that we went to Noli, (nice medievil village with walls round it) for something to eat then went back to the flat in Genova.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Sunday we drove out to western liguria again... first we went to alassio for something to eat, and we walked all along the shore and ate pisa and pastry.&nbsp; We got in the car then and drove down argentina valley, or the silver valley from&nbsp;Taggia&nbsp;right up into the mountains.&nbsp; At the top of the valley is a medievil village Triora in the middle of nowhere and very atmospheric and bit creepy - they burnt loads of 'witches' there in the 16th century... we went to the witch museum, but couldn't understand anything as was in italian.&nbsp; Back down the mountain we both of us got ripped off by some little old lady by buying a cheese each for 18 euros (don't ask). Finally we went to San Remo, and looked round the old part of the town which is medievil again.&nbsp; My left foot was roughly about 2 times the size of the right one (due to mosquitoe bites and infection). But apart from that it was all very nice....
urlLink     (Cue Jurassic Park Music! ... der der da dahhh, der der dah da!!!) Retch n Smell's epic trek!&nbsp; urlLink     &nbsp;  hmm, difficult to know where to start with this one.... First of all me and Retch had to fly back to Genova Nervi from Florence to meet up with Patrizia at 6pm.&nbsp; We were told to pack up essential stuff into back-packs and we all went off in a group of about 6 at about 8pm to camp out the night at the highest point of Monte Portofino.&nbsp; We took lots of food and drink.&nbsp; The plan was to just sleep there without tents... but soon after the wine and food had been eaten and drunk.... it started to piss down.&nbsp; Now, not being a natural camper, i had proceeded to drink quite a bit to get used to the idea of sleeping outside... so it was quite fun trying to walk back down the mountain pissed in the pissing rain in the pitch black at 1 in morning.  &nbsp;  The next day me and retch woke up early and we all with Patrizia decided to go for a walk anyway as the weather looked better.&nbsp; Me and Rach decided this sounded like a nice idea - to go for a nice cliff walk to the beach... we decided to plan accordingly and be sensible and&nbsp;so took the following between both of us:  1. 2 spare pairs of knickers  2. face powder  3. 2 handbags  4. 2 beach towels  5. suntan lotion  6. one book and 3 postcards w
