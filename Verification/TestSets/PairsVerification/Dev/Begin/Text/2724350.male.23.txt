This is my first time writing my deep thoughts down(not to mention publicising it) in Blogspot .  I am currently a student studying physiotherapy in a local polytechnic in Singapore. It was like a dream come true because I had always wanted to do this course since graduating from secondary school. However, I found out that the higher you expect something to be, the greater the impact of disappointment if it does not meet your expectations. But, this does not mean I regret studying this course.   Through this course, I saw with my own eyes humility and compassion. Unlike those medical dramas which portray the hero/heroine in tears-inducing scenarios, what I witnessed did not turn me into a cry-baby, BUT it touched the bottom of my heart and inspired me to continue this journey. Till now(almost 2 years since I entered the course) I am still in the course though thoughts of giving up are still surfacing in my mind. But whenever I recall those touching scenes during my attachment, I pick myself up and carry on.             So, moral of the story is,  the reality may be different from your dream but never forget what you started out to achieve .
This is the fifth day since I started writing in Blogspot. The HTML coding proved to be a killer to an amateur like me cos I took HOURS just to understand a simple sentence! Seems like my belief that I am a fast learner is finally broken...Sob sob. There were times when I really felt like breaking the CPU to vent my frustration.

All these had resulted in little sleep during the night and had caused me to be unable to even walk properly in the morning cos I nearly bumped into a girl(quite nice-looking though) when I was walking back home in a daze. I am not trying to discourage anyone to attempt HTML but don't do it overboard. However, all these obstacles did not dampen my spirits but it had further fuelled my desire to make my site a PERFECT one. It had been years since I felt such pure adrenaline flow in my blood and I am not going to miss out on this experience, even at the expense of other things!
I am not a person who likes to watch Taiwan drama serials, but after watching an episode of the much-acclaimed Westside Story, starring the famous male pop group 5566, it caught my immediate attention. Although the storyline may be crappy at times, there are some things in the drama which set my inquisitive mind to work.   A friend of mine once told me humans like to find someone to identify with, irregardless whether they are fictitious or not. I found the thinking of one of the male lead q
