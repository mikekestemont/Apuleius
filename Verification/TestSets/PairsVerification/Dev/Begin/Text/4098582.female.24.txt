So "Inspiration" hooked me into writing a diary of my own.  I've recently started to read people's lives through their online journalling and have spent ... *ahem* ... not hours of course, because I'm so productive and would never waste my time on frivolous activities, but more like...SMALL snippets of my day spent reading their adventures.   My first entry was copy and pasted from a new found diary I discovered late last night.  (Thanks Ernie!)  I was literally laughing out loud, it was so funny!  =D (although it might have been because of the wee hour in the night - my brain (if you can call it that) shuts down after 1am and it was...after 1am when I was reading it...let's just say that).   I thought I would take this site to write about funny/traumatic/crazy events that occur in my so-called life, but also, to record things I might never be able to voice out loud to the people who actually know me.  Life is weird that way...  So CHEERS to a beginning that hopefully will progress into something worth reading.
why i hate my name. again.  (The scene:  urlLink Chaat Cafe , last night. I'm at the counter with my boyfriend, ordering dinner. This time, instead of italics being in Chinese like in previous posts, italics signify a heavy, heavy Indian accent.)  Ernie: Hi, one chicken pesto stuffed naan and a chicken tikka dinner please, to go.Woman at the counter: Okay. What's your name?  Ernie: Ernie.  Woman: What?  Ernie: Ernie.  Woman: Ornie?  Ernie: Ernie.  Woman: ORRNIE? [flashes Ernie a dirty look]Ernie: ... yes.Woman: Hrm. [writes my name down, hands it to chef]  After paying with my credit card, I open up my wallet and look for some cash to put in the tip jar. Since I only have bills above $10, I decide I'm not that generous and put my wallet back in my pants, only for the woman cashier to notice and give yet another glare of death. "I think she hates me," I say to Mike.  So, I'm sitting in one of the benches marked for to-go customers, taking in the ambiance; there are framed pictures of Bollywood stars, and the restaurant is still filled with mostly Indian patrons, a promising sign of knowing whether the restaurant is going to be good or not. (As opposed to a restaurant that has a name like, say, "Rick and Mollys House of Sushi." Right?) Although I find it funny that the Indian chef calls out for the name "Horny" for a to-go order.  What kind of Indian name is Horny?  The chef repeats the name again. "HORNY?" on the giant microphone. Except this time he is looking straight at me.  Now at this point, I'm not necessarily thinking he's trying to say the word "horny" - I'm thinking the cashier wrote the name "Ornie" and he's just pronouncing the name a little differently because he's not from America and it's like the game Telephone, when you sit around a circle with your 12-year old friends and you giggle as the p
