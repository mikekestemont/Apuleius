Bob Dylan's concert ticket sales went on sale Saturday. Get them at www.ticketmaster.com  Did you know that AC/DC's latest concert (which was a couple months ago) sold out in three minutes?
urlLink    Spent Saturday listening to this at my Grandma's cause I had nothing else to do. It's actually a pretty good CD. Lots of people are yelling about how 1/4 of the songs are covers, but they're good covers. Also has one original song ("Don't Cry") and a version of "November Rain". But, I think that "Appetite for Destruction" was a better album. Too bad they basically disbanded...&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Oh yeah, the name of these cans are the Sony MDR-D66SL Eggo Headphones. This is a picture of them folded.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Now these are good headphones. Made by Sony these cans cost 90 bucks. Thats really the only setback to them. Lots of money. But aside from that, the come with nice comfy ear pads, the sound quality is supposedly excellent, and they're light. They are also foldable, small enough to fit into a jacket pocket easily. The bass is a little lighter than most headphones, but an equalizer solves that problem. Sold at www.audiocubes.com . Sony discontinued making these, so they're in limited stock. Which reminds me I need money soon...&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    My new CD player. Really cool. Gleam black. 50 Hours of battery life, Bookmarking, digital mega bass, 23 mm thick. The clip on remote is handy too, but the upgrades and look compared from the old Psyc really makes it worth the fifty dollars. But the headphones...they suck. So...&nbsp; urlLink
Hmmm, havent written in a while. Just to clear things up, i bugged my mom long enough to let me go to Canobie. That was fun, got wet, got ditched, got bored. You know, everythings so much money there. I swear to god, you can buy a cup of ice cream for the same price of half a gallon of ice cream from the supermarket. Cousins came over, we talked for a while. They never come... but anyways. Missed Alex's party, that was supposed to be fun. But at least i skirted another encounter with death. I burned so many cds over the weekend, Guns n Roses, Smashing Pumpkins, Pink Floyd, AC/DC, Bob Dylan. Now my cd case's heavier, makes me feel good. Which reminds me... BOB DYLANS COMING TO BROCKTON!!!!!!!!!!!!! Tickets arent for sale yet, but the European tour tickets are. 52 dollars, quite a bargain if I do say so myself. So, I might just go on the Germany tour. Just wont understand what the announcer person is saying. But i really cant wait. Bob Dylan is the man. Heres the site to get the info, http://bobdylan.com/live/. In fact, I'm listening to his cd right now to commerate this joyous day. WHOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Great, this is just great. Now i cant go to Canobie. The last class that ever goes and i miss it. complete bull
