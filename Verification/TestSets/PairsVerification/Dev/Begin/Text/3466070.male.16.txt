Welcome to my lil' SickandTwisted home page. You may want to refrain from telling people you visit.
On the 29th I went to the Kittie concert. It was one hell of a show! There were five bands. One local Canadian band(there first time touring the states), 12 Tribe, 36 Crazy Fist, Canderia, and of course Kittie! It was by far the best show I have seen. Kitties mosh pit was crazy! Kittie had an awesome stage show. They had Black, Neon Green, and white strobe lights that went to the beat of the double bass drums. It was cool. The other bands were good to. The lead singer of 36 Crazy Fist stage dived into the crowd and let the crowd sing. It was awesome! I will have pics of the concert soon.
I have a lil' bro by the name of Zach. He is real annoying, but today I have to reflect on all the good things we have done together. We have done some crazy shit man... Like light the hill on fire! LOL. Today is Friday the 30th of July and he going in to the docs so they can diagnose my bro for a heart disorder. He may need heart surgery, but I am hoping for the best. As much of a lil' shit he is if anything happened to him I don't know what I would do! You besta take care MoFo!

Is it a conspiracy or do there assets really hide beneath the fake ones printed upon there butts? Go to Korea and find out for yourself.  Kogal    um... Right... If the point was to look like a crazed fan of another bleached out Korean R&B singer then your on your way there, but if you were trying to look like another Penny Wise(Clown from IT) disciple... Well then you got a while till that happens. This is a sick world!  KOGAL Style
Well... I came to this conclusion recently because of some odd events. First I thought my mom was being cool about buying my condoms for me, but now she wants to invest into getting Sarah on birth control! Well it isn't that it is a bad idea, but the thought kinda freaks me out. Sarah thinx it is a good idea, but it is weird comin from my mom. We don't to have to rely on my mom for such a thing and hiding it is another problem and keeping up with taking them with school and work... It could be quite the hassle. She has been acting very weird though recently. Our van broke down the other day and she has been freaking out about how I need to stay home because we could be h
