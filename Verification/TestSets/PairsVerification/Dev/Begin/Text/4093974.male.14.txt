I was watching the rock countdown and Slither by Velvet Revolver was like 17, almost all the songs on there were total pieces o' crap, but one of the only good songs was three spots away from not being on there.  Those guys working on our septic system finally left, but the next place they went to was my neighbor's two doors down who had something messed up with there plumbing. The guy kept coming to ask my mom stuff and it was like every 10 minutes the bastard knocked on our door and I answered it and he's like "Is your mom there?" and I had to go get her, and it really pissed me off, cus I'm not his slave or something.  I think I'm starting to like rock more than rap, not to say I don't like rap, but yeah. Cus I got birthday money from some of my relatives, so I went to best buy and got the velvet revolver cd, which I've only wanted for about a week, and the new The Roots cd, which I've been waiting for for months, and I've only listened to a few songs on The Tipping Point (The Roots cd) but I've listened to Contraband (Velvet Revolver) like 10 times straight through and am not starting to get even a little bored of it. And on the play list I made of some music I down loaded this week, the only thing even close to rap is two wyclef jean songs, and he's not really a rapper. This also happened when I bought the Ludacris cd, and the Phantom Planet cd a few months ago, the Ludacris cd has only been listened to like once, but Phantom Planet is still in my car cd player. I was thinking about it, and out of the last 10 cd's only two have been rap. I don't know why you'd care about any of that, but just thought I'd get it off my chest (and it's a big chest to get off of cus of the weight thing.)  Now I'm gonna write something I've said and you gotta guess when I said it. "She got her name cus she lets all the guys dock their ships!"
I couldn't fall asleep again because of that damn movie and was up till about 4:00 am. I woke up at about 1:00 PM because the plumbing people called and asked for one of the guys working on our septic system to call the office. So I had to go under the crawl space and tell him, and it was dark, and there was insulation everywhere, and I've been coughing all day.  I went to gamebros today for the last time, and I was gonna buy a game but some other guy bought it right before I came. I hung out there for a while, it's been open since I was one which means 13 years. It kind of seems like this is the end of an era. I'm leaving middle school. Gamebros is closed. The dog I
