Get your hands off my hot dog that is something . . . . . . can't touch.
Hiya. I'm back. Didn't expect me didya? Excellent. . . . . . . :p  Anywho, school is almost over and summer vacation is here for me in 1 more day! :D I can't wait! But the biggest reason I'm so excited about summer is that I will get loads more time to spend with my girlfriend! :D Stephanie ^_^   Maybe I'll go to driving school and learn to drive, and maybe even get my provisional license, and then maybe even get a better (higher paying) job too. But until then, I'm quite content with walking(and running) to see my Stephy ^^ and to go everywhere else.  Incase you haven't noticed. Stephanie is everything to me! :D I love her so much! She makes me feel like the happiest person in the world! Even if I could only see her smile it would brighten up my day! :D There's a piece of her I carry with me! :D it's everywhere I go, everything I see ^_____^ When I sleep, I dream of her and it gets me by :D I can make believe she's here with me ^^ (does it explain why I like to fall asleep alot? lol)  Sure we have our problems, but we work it out and solve them ^^ and I couldn't be happier! :D She's the world to me! My only one ^^ I couldn't picture life without her ^^  "Here I go, scream my lungs out trying to get to you You are my only one I let go, there's just no one, no one like you You are my only, my only one" --Only One-- Yellowcard  Songs like that remind me of her! :D They make me appreciate how fortunate I am to have her ^_^ how lucky I am to be with her :]  I love you Stephy!

... I was awakened by an awful stench. To my greatest horror, the giant branch that fell on me, was actually the cow itself. And the incredibly terrifying stench was its crap, on my face. This is turning out to be the worst day of my life, I should run home and clean up now but...
and then it happened a giant branch came down on me.  I was knocked out.  I then dreamed of a beautiful world where everyone was biped versions of animals.  It was totally amazing there were many people there some wonderous with wings while others were dragons.  In this g
