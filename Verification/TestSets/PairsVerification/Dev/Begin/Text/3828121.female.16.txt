i'm so sleepy. no one decided to wake me up today, so i slept til one.  i have to start waking up at a decent time. i hate the feeling that you slept all day and wasted it. and since we all know i have no life when night falls, well.....the daylight is sacred.  i have to unpack today. i have to say, that is the only part i wasn't looking forward to about home. but i'm glad i'm back! my own room, my own bed, my own stuff. my own kitchen with my own food. bwahahaha....and we HAVE food here. *no offense caitlan*  but, i suppose i need to go and actually get dressed and pull myself together....i look pretty scary upon first waking up. and all i've done this morning is talk to people online and thumb through a seventeen....i lead such an eventful life, don't i? lol
AH! BELOVEDED HOME! HOW I'VE MISSED YOU! A *MUAH* TO YOU, ROOM. AND A *MUAH* TO YOU COMPUTER.....  ahh....  ok, i'm done. Yes, i am home. thank the Lord. and i can finally finally update this thing. when i was in tahlequah it was being dumb and wouldn't let me update, but i'm home, and here i am, updating......bwahahahaha....  well, i'm off to bed. wasn't much of an update, but i'm sleepy....

She claims that everything about him is fake, and he deos things only to look cool.  then why didn't you say something or stay with him if it was that bad?   "and he made me feel like i treated him horribly: and I didnt ...I didn;t : he needs attention constantly, he needs to be the center of attention.. either by being way too hyper, or way to depressed : and when people get in the way of what he wants to be and who he wants to be he ditches them: and here I am, ditched: and I do not have to feel like this: he called me fat before, he cheated on me.. and I felt like I treated him wrong.... what was i thinking?: my self esteem dropped so low when i was with him: he made me feel like i couldnt talk to my guy friends because i was giving them more attention than him and that was bad: I was jelous when i was with him, i w
