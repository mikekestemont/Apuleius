Remember when we were little people and life was simple. Our bodies were young and new, imaginations were fleeting, big decisions were made by our peers, our drawings were primal and love was simple. We chased the boys we liked and when they chased us we would run and holler...in secret sheer joy. We were praised for our lopsided coil pots and cheered on as we attempted to capture the well guarded flag. Birthdays were celebrated by all, sleepovers were spent and play dates included digging for bugs, building forts, running around barefooted in the grass waving sticks in the air and on the rainy days, classic Nintendo games.   As time eventually passed, we became curious.   I remember one day clear as rain. I was in the eighth grade and I was waiting for my mom to pick me up from a sleep over. I was wearing an oversized tee shirt and knee length Umbros, one leg was pink and the other was blue. As I sat down on the sticky leather seats, she told me that I needed to start dressing like a girl. That day she bought me a "My First Bra," which basically consisted of two pieces of triangular cotton and a strap. I don't know what it was supposed to be supporting. But I can understand, she wanted to buy pretty dresses and sparkly stretch pants, not Haines boys tees and Levis.   Today, I can proclaim, self assured, that I am a shop-o-holic.
First and foremost, I admit. I have been lured by Manhattan's pre-war architecture, my dear Sullivan Street and timeless fashion modes. I am guilty of neglecting the L train and bypassing great Brooklyn parties to attend pretentious chic Manhattan gatherings. So, it only happened once, and I felt so uncomfortable, we ended up spending a much enjoyed evening in Fort Greene.  So I guess it is my time to come out of the closet and admit to the world that I will be a Jersey City girl in less than a month. It is perhaps, my worst nightmare...coming true right before my eyes. I remember all you Syracuse girls shunning me for not joining your sorority. I remember.   My point is that, Brooklyn, Jersey, Manhattan, Queens...we are not that far away from each other. We act as if Brooklyn is another state and when I mention Jersey City people give me hugs wishing me best, sending me off as if I am moving to Egypt.   I feel compelled to lure you with our future ping pong table, front porch, enormous living space, grilling area, two bedrooms and two enormous living rooms to lounge in, but I'm going to restrain myself and know that you will come visit because of our true relationship.   My heart sinks when I think about leaving my beautiful street. I will miss the laundry folks, the Tibetan shop man who I swap basketball tips with, my homeless man, Christopher, the Mudhoney salon folks who give me crazy mullets and orange bangs, my horribly organized video store, my neighbor who spins a
