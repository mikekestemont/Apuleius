so strange... Watching probably the only child i will ever have being tossed from home to home.. Glad to see no one else seems to give a shit.  After all why should i?  Maybe because in the lowest time in my life she seemed to be the only thing worth living for.  Guess no one but me will understand just how special a dumb dog can be.  I am so out of control about the whole situation.  I think that's the part that kills me
Scary feeling thinking that the one you haven't even met won't be in your life much longer.... How strange is that.. Such a wierd internet world we live in... Glad u are ok Greg
Now the question is does he know???  Humm, I bet he does.  Wonder if he feels the same about me.. Time will tell I suppose..  Like a thief in the night he stole my heart.  The thing is I'm glad he did!
wonder what he'd do  if he really knew what was deep inside would he still stand aside would he open up to me or or shut me out and let it be I wonder if he all ready knows that's why our friendship grows I'm so glad we found each other I think we are good for one another I hope someday he gives me his heart and this wonderful friendship is just a start  So what do u think of that huh?
in the midst of the black hole in cyberspace, somewhere you loose hope that there are any decent people still in existance.  From somewhere out of the darkness one hand reaches out. Somehow you know this hand is ok.   No matter how fast your world turns upside down by people that u thought were friends, you hold on to this one hand.    No matter how hard you try to hold someone elses hand they seem to loose thier grip.  I think I am a lucky one I not only found one person to hold on to but 2 more that held on to me.  Greg, Kym, Chris thanks guys!! you're the best!
Ok just added this kick ass background!
ok so it seems i have no life.. This settling down stuff is for the birds.  Anyway, I did manage to get my website updated with the blog page attached!  I am so glad this is so easy.  OHHHHHHHHH greg come out come out wherever you are.  from some where in the myst of space I found a friend in the rat race he cures my uncreative mind Wonder if I can keep this find  We are so much alike it seems and seem to have similar dreams to be held captive by lovers kiss For this is what we miss!
Well this seems to be really popular so i hope it works as easy as it says it's going to
said so perfectly so quaint and truthful from the heart The heart only speaks that way.   I am learning to live him.  Though it's hard.  It's wonderful.   I am almost breaking free from the c
