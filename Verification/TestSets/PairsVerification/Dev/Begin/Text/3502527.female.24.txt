I don't know if you can catch ESPN in the PI, but they're airing the annual   urlLink  Scripps National Spelling Bee   . I know, it does sound weird that ESPN has included this kinda thing in their programming but people shouldn't be so surprised after they started airing poker games.  Anyways, I was sitting on the couch checking out one of the final rounds. This awkward-looking Indian kid with a complementary strange name and stoic demeanor,   urlLink  Akshay Buddiga    steps up to the mike. He recieves his word to spell, which is '  urlLink  alopecoid   .' After repeating the word a few times, our man Akshay seems to be deep in thought.  Then it happens. His eyes flutter and begin to grow wider as if he's shocked or something. His body begins to sway to his left a bit. Almost imperceptibly, Akshay begins a slow descent to the ground- drawing gasps from the crowd (probably stifled snickers, too). Further replays (thank you ESPN!) show that he does absolutely nothing to slow his fall. No flailing arms, nothing. You know those videos where you see loggers chopping down trees? Akshay looked just like that. Well, almost like that. Imagine a tree with glasses and prematurely developed facial hair.  At the expense of his embarrassment however, I was left with a classic moment...one of the most hilarious sights I've ever seen. I would pay to relive that shit again.

Current Location : I'm in scenic Lansing, Michigan visiting my girl Michelle.   Job Status : After a brief stint at Google, I'm working as a Game Tester at Visual Concepts. Those familiar with video games will know that they're the producers responsible for the 2K3 series of sports games. After a few weeks working here, I've decided that this isn't the exact industry I want to learn about.  Oh, and I'm sure many of you out there think that testing video games is the perfect job. This isn't exactly the case. While video games are ideal for an hour or two of mindless enjoyment, the fun can wear off when you're stuck playing them hour after hour after hour, etc.  I'm lucky that my coworkers make my job bearable. Well, getting baked before work doesn't hurt either. Hehehehehehe... (stoned laughter).   Game Plan  (tentative of course): 1. Apply for grad school to study advertising. 2. Take the GRE. 3. ?  To be Continued!
Oh man...Rina's got me into Blog-land. You know, I honestly have never felt drawn to blogging. I once tried (and failed) to maintain one a few months ago. It lasted exactly one post.  I guess I can attribute my lack of interest in blogging to my personality. In general, I am a pretty introverted dude. Well, that's not entirely true according to the Myers-Briggs test which you all can take  urlLink here .  I last took this test in high school and on the 'Introvert/Extrovert' chart, I barely scored into 'Extrovert.' It would be interesting to see what I would get on that shit a
