Ok, fine. You know what Daniel, I don't care anymore. Go disappear. I understand why, but I don't accept that. You could at least start a useless fight before you run away like a scared little girl. I know you're reading this.   My flu is really bad now. I couldn't sleep some of the night, which means I'm a grumpy little sheep this morning.  Stevo's trying to get me to stop talking to Will. Honestly, we just talk. (Oh poor Moodster thinks I'm actually falling for another mohaa guy - well yeah, so what? My life. You didn't want me back, so I'm learning to move on.)  Good day.
I am reluctant to do anything today. We're having fish and chips for tea, instead of pizza. I don't know if I could eat though. I might just suck on some ice till my throat feels better. It's a saturday night. Damn Saturday nights. I dislike how I am cut off from the world around me. I don't go out, I don't see people, except when I go to see "professional practitioners". I think I might find out when Brenda's next meeting is, invite Tara and go there for whatever the hell we'll be doing.  I miss social life.
I can't swallow.  I have dreams which oddly enough, involve me brushing deep down my throat? Crazy dreams.  I am tired. My dog woke my by whinging because he couldn't go outside to pee. I am cold. I am bored.
I'm getting the flu, so I doubt I'll be around for a day or two.  I want to hibernate for a week, so the yucky smushy feeling is all gone. Maybe I could just curl up in a ball and kinda deprive myself of oxygen slightly so my body forces me to sleep.  Hmmmm.  As long as I get the basic amount of oxygen I'll live, unfortunately my organs might start shutting down very quickly :(  Oh well. I'll just be a bitchy flu person. A bitchy sad flu person.  A bitchy pms sad flu person.  Anyway, I'm going to bed, goodnight.
I am now on 16 hours (recorded hours, that is) of driving prac. I drove to and from melb, on a friday night, which means lots of other vroom vrooms. It was good :)  Brother back from camp.  Missing certain people who have blocked me - which sucks because it brings all those lonely feelings back.  I better go piss more people off. I seem to be good at it today.
Wonderful morning.  Dad's sick - got the flu or something, so he's home. Mum's working all day.  Lots of people online. Just no one I actually talk to :P  Hearshot Kid Disaster - Coheed & Cambria.  I love this song.  I listened to it alot when we went to Brisbane. I way wasn't over Dan when we went (and considering he lives in Brisbane - and I saw his friend every day), so it was a really depressing trip. The song kept me busy. I so didn't enjoy being in Brisbane. I'm glad we w
