Just a topic that needs to be covered, I have lost count how many times I have had this conversation with Nic, who incidentally agrees whole heartedly. Lets take a trip down memory lane back to the days when I was young … (cue warped picture fade of me looking thoughtful).
So when I was about 16/17 I was well what you would call an alternative person, listening to alternative music and not being a trendy person. Now back then people who were alternative basically were good fun to get along with and accepted people for who they are i.e. It did not mater how you dressed, what music you listened to, it was cool because that was the point! Alternative  people did not want to be judged like the trendy people did and thus were not into judging people by what they wore or listened to. Good times I will tell you.
Ok fast forward time….. Zip……. Present day.
What has happened ??? Being alternative or being a goth has become trendy, hang on you say, trendy?  That’s right so it does not sound to bad but wait there is more, now alternative people seem to have criteria for people to be their alternative friends, woa hang on …. So I can’t be alternative if I like to listen to dance music as well as say foo fighters or filter? Well I like lots of music including Eminem and various other non exclusively alternative music. To highlight this point I will show two examples, my mate Nic is in an alternative pub with his alternative mates when he happens to mention that he likes Dr Dre to which the response it close to him having said that he murders babies for fun??? WHY? Surely he can listen to what he likes ? Another example, I’m in a chat room the other day one that is for alternative / freak / goth / etc / etc people, so someone joins and gets kicked because his name has DJ in it (DJ_somename) so they kick him because he must like dance music and cant possibly be alternative (That was actualy what they said!).
Ok you say what is my point??
My point is that being alternative used to mean being open minded, non judgmental / not judging a book by its cover and liking people because of who they are not how they dress or what they listen to. People you had the best clique of people you actually were how people were supposed to live but now you just as bad as the trendies / townies / chavs that you hate? Can’t you see that you have become what you despise the most, narrow minded self-involved steriotypical group of people.    Well here is a song for you ---- American Hi-Fi – The Art of Loosing.
Enjoy
