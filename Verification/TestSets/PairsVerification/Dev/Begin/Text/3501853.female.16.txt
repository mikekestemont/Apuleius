Today was a long day and it didn't even seem like a break from school. I woke up at like 11 with a migraine but whatever I got ready anyways. I went to Taco Bell around like 12:30...and ya. Then I come home at like 1 and my mom was all pissed off at me cuz I went to Taco Bell and cuz I didn't have my phone so I told her I'd go get it from Kevin but she didn't want me to take the car. I was getting a little ticked off cuz ya know I was trying to get the phone so she'd stop yelling but she wouldn't let me. Finally, we went to go get gas at Sam's and she yelled cuz I didn't know what I was doing with the gas and so ya we finally went to Kev's. I showed up at his house with like a 10 ft. sweater and bummy hair. haha My mom was all pissed off I left my phone, I went to tb and I was wearing this certain sweater so she decides to tell me that "my mistakes cost everyone something" and i'm like thanks ya know. god. So then for some reason I HAD to go to the mall while tim and my mom were in the gym. I didn't really want to but whatever, I went anyways. I got 2 shirts from 5-7-9, those and the 2 shirts I got from express, earings and a cd..I bought quite a lot this weekend for someone who's almost broke. After the mall I came home and tried to just chill for a while but then Arthur IM'd me saying he wanted to go get a bite to eat. That was fine with me cuz I didn't want 2 be moping around and I owed him for that one time I ditched him, sorry hun. Dennis called him and wanted to come too so he did. It was fine going there cuz I knew the route kinda but as soon as I entered gates oh man my driving skills went out the window and I never got them back lol. I got to Arthur's after a lot of reversing and what not and got to Dennis fine. We chilled at Dennis' for a bit so they could "study". They told me to call Kev so I did but he wasn't answering so then we left for Barnaby's. Okay fucking get this...I didn't see a stop sign by the park at the gates and I was doing like 40 over the stop sign and right as how I'm supposed to leave the gates there's a fucking cop behind me with his lights on and I got pulled over. My heart stopped :'( He asked for my license and insurance. I was trying to hold in tears cuz of the boys there but I was scared outta my mind. Then another cop comes by this cop and after like 5 minutes they finally tell me that it was just a warning a
