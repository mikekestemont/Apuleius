I thought this was cool -  urlLink sperm washing .
In the process of packing to move to my new apartment today, I found my old diary.  It is my diary from 1996 - early 1998, my last two years of high school, and one entry from University.   Oh god, though.. the nostalgia!  It was so weird to go back and read that stuff from being 16 and 17 years old.  It brought everything right back, remembering how good it felt thinking the guy you liked might like you; the doubt I felt when Doug started spending a lot of time with Olly; the depression I felt over our breakup; the despair I felt when I found out he was going out with Olly; the relief of finding myself 'over' Doug, and being able to be friends with him again; the elation at wondering if Blair liked me and finding out he did; the crushing sensation when we broke up and blaming myself.. the craziness that was our post-relationship relationship.. just a whole lot of feelings whirring around.  I even had an entry about how I felt about hearing that Princess Di had died.  It took me right back to that very second when i was writing the entries and experiencing those emotions for the first time.  I could say I now have the Benefit of hindsight.. but I wouldn't have had things any other way than the way they happened.  (and Doug and Blair if you ever read this.. Smile and Wave you're now famous in a very limited kind of sort of way.. )   High school was such a weird time of life.  I was a total geek at  urlLink high school , but I had so much fun.  Reading my diary brought back a few vivid memories:  The graffiti in between the science block and F block that said "jah rasta" on it.   Running cross country and stopping off on the beach for a quick dip in the ocean before going back to school  Rolling the skirt of my school uniform up to make it shorter  Watching the cloud of ash from the  urlLink eruption at Mt. Ruapehu  come north towards the Mount from my English class in F Block.    The school lip sync (ooo outrageous!) where I was Kimber from  urlLink Jem!  and me and my friends created an awesome entry, complete with Mortal Kombat facedown and gun battle between the Holograms and the Misfits, where of course, the Holograms won.  I bought the video of it, but I have no idea where that went.  I would love to have a copy no matter how embarrassing.   Waterbombing the kids who had to run the cross country, when we were in 7th form.  We went round to Tracy McCutcheon's house and threw waterbombs at all the 3rd and 4th form kids.  hehehe.  I tried to dunk a teacher, but ended up getting drenched in the ocean myself.. nevermind, he got his too.. hehe.   Watching Oprah and Ricki Lake, not to mention  urlLink mtv uk  during unsupervised 'study' at t
