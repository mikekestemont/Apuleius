Sorry I haven't posted int he past few days. My computer has been acting up. I started school on Thursday it was a half day.I have Mr. Smith for Latin...first hour. I really would have preferred him for sometime later in the day. I really don't like him. He's too philisophical and just utterly full of it. To top it off he's a hypocrite. He says he wants us to be involved in plays and broaden our horizons, so to speak, but when it comes to doing something for drama he puts up a fight about letting me out of class. He also shows favoritism, and as you could probably tell, I'm not his favorite in anyway. He's an evil teacher, he gave a test today, the SECOND day of school. We haven't even learned anything yet.My second hour is Chemistry. It looks pretty fun, and we have computers at each table. Third hour is Art II I have that class with Ronnie so it's going to be fun. I already have all of my supplies since I always buy extra pencils and artpads everytime I'm at the store. Fourth hour is Algebra II, I don't care for math too much, but she's a nice teacher.I'm not in the honor class, and I was going to switch into it until Chelsea told me that the teacher stunk at cheating and it would be easier to just stay with the normal class. She was a math genius and she was passing Mrs. Hanson's class with a C or D so yea I'm going to stick with normal Algebra. Fifth hour is American History. He is HILARIOUS. The whole period today he had Chelsea and me dying out on the floor laughing. He's great, he so sarcastic it's funny.He's going to be a fun, but hard class.Last class is English III. I don't care much for this class either. It's alot of work not that I mind that, I'm just somewhat of a procrastinator so I have alot to do. I am in the process of reading sparknotes on Alas Babylon since I didn't read the actual book this summer. Eheh, my bad. I'm probably going to skim them sometime this weekend.Also for her class, I have to write an essay on my personality. This'll be easy and hard at the same time, if that makes sense.That's due on Monday. Wednesday I have a collage on Alas Babylon due and I have to explain why I made it the way I did...I have to read a bit of the book to do that I guess. So I'm getting started on all of this after I finish typing up this blog. I haven't talk to Flare in forever, and its kinda starting to make me sad.  I can't download MSN yet so I haven't been able to talk to him. ~sigh~ Sarah is going off to college so I won't see her for a long while cause she won't have internet either. I went to see a movie with William again today. We s
