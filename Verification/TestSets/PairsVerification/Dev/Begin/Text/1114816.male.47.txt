Having spent most of the past 2 months at work dealing with some managers who valued gamesmanship over working as a team I am happy to report a meeting with the grand sultans resulted in the correct decisions being made. It was odd. In the weeks leading up to this meeting certain of the managers repeatedly asserted strong positions. Yet once we got into the meeting the did a 180 degree turn and abandoned their previous (irresponsible yet non-negotiable) opinions. As a manager I've never really grasped why so many other managers would rather indulge in gamesmanship than simply doing their job.     The good news is that's over. Plus I've taken names and plan to put some whoop ass on some of these folks if they are so unwise as to pursue stupid agendas again. Their failure, also oddly, will enable me to work with some of the other good managers to push through changes and will likely result in us doing much better in the future. Hmm. Maybe having a few pointy haired bosses around is a good thing! (ha!!!)
Well, today's my first Father's day. I'm feeling a little emotional about it which surprised me. Bringing a child into this world is quite a responsibility especially with all the fears and challenges we face. Having the responsibility to raise a child who can navigate her way through the moral choices in order to find happiness seems like more load than anyone can confidently bear. I sometimes feel even a few simple choices as a father could cause major problems in my child's life.    I also feel the burden of needing to prepare materially for my daughter's future. Everything from having the money to enable her to go to college, should that make sense 18 years from now, to the relatively short term need to select a school path for her. Our elementary school is not rated very well and I keep wondering whether or not to consider starting my daughter in private school. I think the early years of schooling are the most critical. The local middle and high schools are rated very well but I fear she might fall behind and learn poor social skills long before she reaches middle school. I also wonder whether it is really feasible to leave the private school system once we start her down that path (if we decide to). Good private schools are quite expensive when you consider they require 12 years (or more counting pre-school).
We have a 2 month old daughter at home. For the past 4 nights she has slept through the night without waking us up - 8 hours plus! If you have never had kids this won't mean a whole lot to you but take my word for it that this is unusual in a child so young. Several of my friends and co-workers have babies slightly older than mine and none of theirs have accomplished this feat. We are lucky indeed!
In a couple of weeks my in-laws (mother-in-law and wife's stepfather) will come for a visit. T
