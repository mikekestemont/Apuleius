First:  A bit of trivia.  John O'Tuomy* (1706-1775) owned an inn (pub?) in Limerick, Ireland, and was a well-known poet in his day.  Here's one of his poems, actually a limerick!      I sell the best brandy and sherry      To make good customers merry;           But at times their finances           Run short, as it chances,      And then I feel very sad, very.   *O'Tuomy is one of the spellings of the Toomey name.  Second:  The above limerick is perfect, as it relates so well to the props seen in many of the...  urlLink MORE PHOTOS!!    Woo-hoo.  Many thanks to Jim for these outstanding shots.   Anyone else have photos?  Let me know, I can either post them for you or you can provide the web link to them here.  Seems like the membership in ToomeyBlog continues to grow...let's hope we get everyone on board eventually.
OK, so I am a slow learner.   Shannon and I recently returned from our Nation's Capital. I will save all the gory details about the plane travel in light of the fact that we visited the WWII Memorial, so we should not be complaining about the minor setbacks we experienced. The most impressive features of the memorial are the 24 bronze bas relief sculptures along the ceremonial entrance. Each one tells a different story about the war.

So far, 7 Toomeys are members of ToomeyBlog.  There are 22 more Toomeys/Dugans (with e-mail addresses) who we're waiting to join us here...hopefully soon!  I know there are questions about how to use this blog.  It's a little confusing at first; it took me a while to figure it out me-self.  So one of the big question marks is:  Commenting vs. Posting?  COMMENTING -- If you read something here at ToomeyBlog and want to add your two cents, just look for the "Comments" link at the end of that topic and click.  (If you're not logged in, you will be so prompted, then you can post your comments and you're all set.)  POSTING -- This is trickier.  Say you just got back from a trip and want to share a report with the rest of us.  This is just one example of when you'd want to create a new post (which others can then read and comment on).  So, where do you post your NEW story?  Doesn't look like there's any way to do it here, does it?  You're probably thinking the policy here is, "No ticky, no laundry."  Well...not so fast there, pardner.  You CAN get there from here.  First, you need to go to a different web page (meaning:  different than toomeyblog.blogspot.com).    That other page is known as your "Dashboard" page which is like a control panel.  To get there, go to   urlLink http://www.blogger.com/home    -- once you're logged in, you will see your "Dashboard" and you can create new posts from there, edit your own posts, or you can modify your profile if you want, etc.  And it will show up here.  (Important:  Be sure to a
