Despite  urlLink Jeb Bush fighting  tooth and nail to keep flawed touch-screen voting machines in Florida, the GOP has a different warning for its public.  urlLink The GOP&nbsp;has distributed flyers which "urged some Miami voters to use absentee ballots because touch screens lack a paper trail and cannot "verify your vote."  So these flawed machines are good enough for Democrats but not to be used by Republicans? I can't imagine the GOP working any harder for a 2000 repeat
urlLink  According to the New York Times   , "Almost all the electronic records from the first widespread use of touch-screen voting in Miami-Dade County have been lost, stoking concerns that the machines are unreliable as the presidential election draws near. The records disappeared after two computer system crashes last year, county elections officials said, leaving no audit trail for the 2002 gubernatorial primary."   Touch screen machines cannot be allowed in this presidential election. Besides the fact that the president of the company producing them has said he is "committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to the president next year", the machines are already malfunctioning in Florida.&nbsp; Our Democracy can't handle another appointed President, we need an elected one.  urlLink Fight touch-screen voting here .

How is it that they got into jet simulators to begin with, when you need a twin engine certification first? Were they reporting back to anyone in the mid-east, and who?     urlLink Read it here for yourself . It's important to understand what happened the day of the attacks, but what about the months and years prior?
They're getting sued, so it may not be up for much longer.&nbsp; You've probably seen it, but here's  urlLink a good stab at both sides .
urlLink  Republicans blast Bush for his poor environmental policies.    "Russell Train, a Republican, was the EPA's second chief under presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. But he said Bush's record is so dismal he's casting his presidential vote for Democrat John Kerry in November."
...with Clinton's #1.  urlLink Clinton, Johnson and Kennedy over saw the strongest economies in post-WW2 America  based on GDP, unemployement and deficit reduction, according to Forbes. Who's at the very bottom? H.W. Bush. Oh, and  urlLink the stock market does better under Democrats too .
With the 9/11 commissions final report coming out tomorrow,  urlLink word of major missed opportunities to prevent the attacks.  True, the fault lies partially with Clinton and partially with Bush. But Clinton isn't running for reelection, and Bush is. We can't allow 4 m
