Turkey for me, turkey for you, let's eat turkey in my big brown shoe! Turkey with the girls and turkey with the boys, my favorite kind of pants are courduroys! Gobble gobble gee and gobble gobble gickel, I wish that turkey only cost a nickel. Turkey for you, turkey for me, can't believe Tyson gave that girl VD... -Credit to Jason  That was just a snippet of The Turkey Song by Adam Sandler... Damn, I want to watch 8 Crazy Nights badly...
People nowadays just don't have it... Usually I can handle homework normally. But when it come's to a single Chinese homework, I can't seem to finish it... Well, either that or it'll take me 2 hours to finish it. I hadn't done that particular Chinese homework, which is about snipping an article from a Chinese daily, paste it in the excercise book, find words from the dictionary and lastly,  write your own opinion ... Aw crap, what Chinese opinions could come out of this English based brain?  I  thought  I could trust my friend to help me find 3 articles and write down a simple sentence about the article's opinions...

Honestly, I don't know why I should regard him as a friend anymore... He said he can help me and yet this is how he treats me? Grrrr....

Refreshed? Ah... that's correct...  Last Thursday was a total hell for me, the whole scene from my prespective looks like I keep "blacking out" every 10 minutes, except that the "blacking out" was actually me falling asleep at my desk, head bent down like a fisherman waiting for a fish to eat the bait.  I am totally skilled at this, nobody has caught me red-handed, at least for now... I'd be semi-alert all the time and had actually answered the teachers' questions 2 times on that day, despite me being in dreamland 7 seconds ago.  The whole damn episode started the day before. What? I can't believe that I had actually accepted to do my friend's h
