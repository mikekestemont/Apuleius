I've placed you in my virtual shopping basket.  Do I dare press the Checkout button?  You cost $400, but I think you may be worth every penny to me.  I've never seen or heard you in person, but your picture looks beautiful, and your sound samples are sweet as morning rain.  Until a few days ago, I didn't even know you existed.  But now I cannot picture myself without you.  Yes, I think I'm commited enough to press that button.  Wait a minute, no free shipping?  Dammit!  What the hell, you only weigh 3 pounds, and they don't ship you free?  Well, I suppose I can spend the extra $9.37 to get you shipped to my doorstep.  And then we will sing together into the night, and I shall play that cool part at the end of ELP's Lucky Man over and over again...
A few days ago Lucas announced the title of the final chapter:&nbsp; Revenge of the Sith.&nbsp; Cool title.&nbsp; Just hope the movie itself is cool.&nbsp; He'd better not put any more love story stuff in this one.&nbsp; The 'love dialogue' in that last one made me gag.&nbsp; I seriously could barely watch those scenes.&nbsp; Did he just watch some crappy daytime soap operas and steal random lines from those?&nbsp; Fortunately, he has a chance to redeem himself with this last one.&nbsp; Hopefully he focuses on violence and death and destruction.&nbsp; Then the movie will be totally bitch.&nbsp; And I've heard that Chewbacca will make an appearance in this last one...sweet!!!&nbsp; Although, if Lucas really wants to make everyone happy, he should do this:&nbsp; have a scene where Chewbacca meets Jar Jar, and they sit down to a nice friendly game of Hologram Space Chess, like they played in&nbsp;A New Hope.&nbsp; Then, have Jar Jar win the game.&nbsp; Then, have Chewbacca rip Jar Jar's arms out of their sockets!!&nbsp; Wookies have been known to do that.&nbsp; Can you imagine the crowd's response to a scene like that?!&nbsp; I think everyone would forgive Lucas for his past transgressions if he put that scene in the new movie.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wonder if its too late to email Lucas with my idea?
Yeah that's right.&nbsp; I've been informed that my yearly allocation of vacation days has been bumped from ten per year up to fifteen.&nbsp; That's some sweet action!&nbsp; Even though I rarely use them.&nbsp; I have something like twenty days saved up already.&nbsp; &nbsp;I suppose I should make more use of them, like take a day off and volunteer at a retirement home.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or take off a day and just play computer games the whole time.&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; I like that second option much more.&nbsp;&nbsp; I need to hone my computer gaming abilities.&nbsp; That's how you get all the chicks.&nbsp; They certainly appreciate a man who has mad PC gaming skills.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe I'll just take a sick day instead, that way I can keep my vacation days.&nbsp; Then I'll have even more vacation days that will go unused.&nbsp;&nbsp; Man, I'm starting to feel ill, I don't know if I'll be in tomorrow.&nbsp; I t
