So, Harry Potter Day has come and gone. I think I'll need to see the movie again before I make a final decision; right now I'm rather ambivalent. A few points:  What I didn't like: - Camera tricks that just looked cheap. Still no good CGI. OK, but not REALLY good CGI. - Not enough explanation about Harry's Dad, and how James' old friends ended up where they are now. They left out a few things that are going to be important later for background, and I'm not sure they were good decisions - No creapy Voldemort asides. Also, they left out the explanation of the Dementors and the Dark Side (used in that Star Wars kind of way). Also may be important later. - Guy who replaced Richard Harris was crap. Forgot his name, liked him a lot in Toys. - Not enough Quidditch. No Wood!  What I did like: - Hermoine punching Malfoy! That few seconds of film was SO worth the $10. It was everything I thought it should be. - Faster pace, and fewer classroom scenes. Those don't translate so well onto film. Although, as an aside, we aren't seeing nearly enough of Nevil(Sp?). - The guys who play Fred and George REALLY grew up. They're yummy. - Even with as much stuff as they took out, they were true to the spirit of the book.  My biggist problem is actually with a decision that I very much understand, but do not agree with. The movie is very obviously targeted to teens and young adults. Which makes sense, as they buy movie tickets. But this is a story about 13 and 14 year olds. The books become more mature as the characters do, and that's as it should be; I just think this movie went farther than it should have.  OK, now off to bed. Have to be up at 7 to volunteer. Nighty Night!
Well, Happy Hour Wednesday turned out to be interesting. No Ex, and the Boy only showed for about 10 minutes before running off to a work meeting, then to visit with Ex alone. Roommate K and AD and I left Happy Hour and headed over to the Neighborhood Pool Hall, where poor AD went on a bender which necessitated taking her out to the back parking lot to throw up, as she destroyed the bathroom.  Poor girl. We got her back to her place very late when she had stopped heaving, and stayed over to be sure she was OK. Roommate K left for work in the AM, I spent most of the day keeping AD company etc. then went to see the Boy who was working from home.  Hung around and had dinner with the boy, got home after dark. I was up at 7 this morning for reasons no one could describe, especially me. The door installers have been here since 8, which seems to me to be an exceptionally long time to install a door; but what do I know.  Tonight, great large group to Betheda for the third H
