Created by Charlie Bayliss and Lazer, this is a verrrry excellent animation job done with a remix of the transformers theme, aswell as some stylish dancing from my favourite transformer from when I was a wee little lad... (the giant tape deck) Soundwave and his tape, Lazer.  Watch it. It is good.  http://triadfrog.home.comcast.net/
i'm leaving all of you for a wee bit.  off to colorado i go to reunite with long lost members of the miller/beechy tribe.  of which i know no one.. except for my direct cousins.  yay for anya!  i get to ride a horsey!  i'll be whitewater rafting on monday.. im not really excited cause it's probably going to be very cold and cold and wet does not equal fun.  on tuesday the reunion shall begin.. muahaha.  poopers.  and then there will be some horsies and food and swimming and hiking and other stuffs.  and then i'll be home on tuesday the sixth.  .... wheeeeeeeee.  i'm excited for the drive though i'll probably throw up a lot because the new honda accord is too smoothy smoothy smooth.  damn it's luxuriousness.  oh well... the throwing up will keep dave awake and mad at me.  wait.. that's not good.  dammit.  well.. tootleedooss my dears.  i'll miss youuuuuu.

Boring indeed. It's fathers day, yay. I have been working hard at cracking a version of Halo so that I don't have to pay for it, but it turns out I can only play multiplayer on hacked servers, which sucks because there is a grand total of 6... and 2 of them dont work, 2 of them dont have anyone, and one of them (the most popular one) tells me my cd key is invalid, though it is a hacked server.  Whatever.  I've made a pile of the books I've partially read and plan to take them down one by one soon until I can get them off my mind.  It's about time. I'll have time when Jessica goes on her vacation/family reunion.  Goodbye.
