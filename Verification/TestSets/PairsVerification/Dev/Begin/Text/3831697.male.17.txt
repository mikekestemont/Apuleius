In honor of the passing trade deadline, I've compiled this list on how to make it as a GM in any professional sports league.   1.  Show complete disregard for team chemistry. It's completely overrated. The Marlins that upset the Yankees in Yankee Stadium to win the World Series was just an anamoly. Also, disregard the fact that Detroit Pistons beat the heavily favored Lakers. You can help yourself out by trading any team captains or leaders like the Dodgers just did when they got rid of Lo Duca.   2.   Trade away one of the best players on your team for younger talent. Every GM does this. This way, you can suck not only now, but you can also suck later. Consistency! That's how you keep your job. Example? None other than the GM of the Los Angeles Clippers, Elgin Baylor.   3.   If it ain't broke, fix it anyway. This would be like adding an outfielder to a team with way too many outfielders in the first place. The Dodgers just did this when they acquired Steve Finley from the Diamondbacks, which were exercising rule number two.   4.   Alienate yourself from your fans. Yet another common practice in all major sports leagues. I don't have any good examples, but trust me. Do this, and you shall succeed.   5.  Put yourself in salary cap hell early in your term. This is a great idea that will increase your job security immensely. How, you ask? If you aren't getting anything done, you can complain about the cap keeping you from signing people. This doesn't work for baseball right now, see rule number six.   6.  Try to get hired by a small market teams. This works especially for baseball. If you suck in a small market, you can blame it on you money-grubbing owner. Then you force him to give you money so that you can observe rule number seven.   7.  Sign free agents in the offseason to deals that would otherwise seem ridiculous. Beating out your competition was never so much fun! Three points and three rebounds off the bench last year? Sounds like a forty million dollar player to me!   8.  In the unlikely event that you do get fired, blame it on anyone but yourself. This is the most used technique in all of jobs. If you play the blame game enough, some one just might hire you for their team.  There you have it.  Follow those rules and money will meet your hands as a major sports GM.

This is a day late, but anyone who watched the Cardinals-Cubs game should be pissed off at Cubs All-Star pitcher, Carlos Zambrano.  What he did the other night was not only childish, but definitely warrants a suspension of some kind.    For those who did not see the game, I'll give you the info.  Zambrano is a pitcher who gets real lively when he pitches, kind of like Jose Lima from the 2004 World Series Champion Los Angeles Dodgers (Hottest team in baseball!).  Anyway, Carlos was a little wild t
