This news put me in mind of Dr. Phil, that straight-talking guru of clueful relationship dynamics.&nbsp; Why, you ask? Well, here is a typical vignette from one of his shows:   Little Johnny is having a temper tantrum. He demands a toy, the parents say no, he throws himself to the floor and pitches a fit.&nbsp; “Here’s your toy!” concedes the well-meaning parent with misplaced solicitation – anything to make the fussing stop.&nbsp; Dr. Phil rightly points out that Johnny quickly learns that if he acts unpleasantly enough, he’ll get what he wants. “No” doesn’t really mean no, and all he has to do is raise the stakes until parents – and others – give in to him. Later, when Johnny is bullying kids on the school yard and making pocket change by threatening to beat others up, he already knows this tactic works.&nbsp; Those who don’t pay up, get beat up, just as he has threatened, and others are cowed into compliance.&nbsp;   These tactics work until the day someone kicks Johnny’s butt and he reaps unexpected consequences from his actions.&nbsp; His ploy would also cease on the miraculous day that those he bullied refused to comply with his demands in spite of consequent beatings.&nbsp; If Little Johnny doesn’t get what he wants when he beats people up, he’ll change his tactics. It’s human nature.   The same might be said of Little Abdulla.   Terrorists and assorted “freedom fighters” are effectively beating up foreigners on Iraqi soil these days. Their victims are the same ones that always fall first to bullies:&nbsp; the helpless, the innocent, those who clearly cannot protect themselves, such as unarmed transport and support workers.&nbsp; While the ones who can stand up to those bullies – armed Americans – offer defiance while looking for the appropriate butt to kick, the national families of the victims are snatching their kinfolk back from the playground and promising to stay out of the bullies’ territory: whatever it takes, essentially, to keep their children safe.   In this, the guerilla forces in Iraq have scored a big success. They have intimidated not only the players in their sandbox, but the kin networks and nation-families that stand behind them.&nbsp;&nbsp; And like most who play into the victim role, these countries have found it easier to shrink away from the threat than to stand foursquare facing it and defy the rules by which it operates.   This is an essential step in dealing with a bully. You don’t play by their rules, or you will lose. The consequences they expect to achieve from their brutal actions c
