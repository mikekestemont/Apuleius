after another wonderful week and weekend at home, the journey again takes me to ohio, hopefully the last trip up here for a while. weekend was great, weather is finally starting to cool down and the humidity is at a reasonable level. don't feel like the humid glue hits me when i walk outside, but i'm sure that was just for the weekend and the humid swamp will return again.  saturday turned into an xbox day - brute force - was at our beckoning, and we whipped up on some alien muntant ass.  sunday was football as usual, no good games on tv - but still enjoyed the thrill of football season.   and now to monday -- up at 4:45am to catch a 6:30am flight, i truly believe flights that early should be banned.  so i get on the plane, same seat as last time i might add, and the flight attendant remembers me - here, all i want to do is sleep - and she has to tell me how she remembers me from 2 weeks ago and from before then and how i sit in the same seat.  all very good observations on her part, but remember i just want to sleep.  i did my best to be kind and talk with her, but when she came back to sit across from me and talk - i had to continue on to sleep land.
Once again how music can make you think... anyone?    Fuel - "Falls On Me"     You see me hanging round  starting to swear about this black hole of a dark field  and silently within hands touchin skin sharp  breaks my disease and i can breath   and all of your ways  all you dream falls on me  it falls on me  and your beautiful sky  the light you breath  falls on me  it falls on me ahha  i feel like a pain  it draws me in again sqaushes all my worst of me  darkness in my veins  I never could explain  and i wonder if you have ever seen  and still believe   /chorus  am I that strong  to carry on  have i changed your life  have i changed my world could you save me ahhhhha   /chorus  /chorus
what a difference good music can make...
does the dream exist... anyone?  somedays are better than other days, life is strange like that.  one day you can be in such a good mood and not really understand the reasoning behind the spark in your eyes and the next day your mood is the complete opposite, once again, not understanding the mud in your eyes.
weekend adventure list: - night club - party favors - late night walks - watching the sunrise - darkness durning the day  my weekend was a big adventure from the time i got off the plane on friday until i went to sleep last night .. just the way i wanted it to be.
after an extremely busy, yet productive, week in ohio... i am home at last.  able to once again relax and enjoy my sensory surroundings. tonight will b
