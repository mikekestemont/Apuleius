greetings. today i got my hair cut...i got long bangs.yes, i am livin on the edge- i am riskay. i went to toronto with the fam. and josh. i must say toronto is pretty scary when soccer games are being played in the same area that u have to walk in. this one 'soccer hooligan' checked out my whole family - including josh...and even my father. we went to joe badalis for dinner where apparently every staff member is somehow related to this Joe. hmmm...i was quite suspecious when its an italian resturant and there were waiters/waitresses working of many different races. then we walked to second city (a show where they perform comedy sketches)  .
