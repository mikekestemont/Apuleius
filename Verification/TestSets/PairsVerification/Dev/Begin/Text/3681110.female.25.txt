today is my dad's birthday.  so, HAPPY BIRTHDAY DADDY!  okay, now for the rest of my day.  i spent the majority of my day calling mexican and chinese restaurants to send them information on upcoming lease sites.  most of them yelled at me "you call back tomorrow!"  "i know no maganer (manager)"  one guy told me that his restaurant was owned by Fidel Castro.  needless to say today was a bust.    i'm going to the doctor tomorrow.  nothing is wrong with me but i haven't had a general practitioner in five years and now that i have insurance it would be beneficial to establish a raport with one.  maybe he can tell me why i am tired all the time.  my weekend plans are shaping up.  we have a couple of parties to go to and nathan is playing one last show at the oasis before moving to nashville.  by the way, he was signed to yep roc records, the same label as reverend horton heat and caitlin cary (formerly of whiskeytown).  i'm so proud of him!    my posts aren't as entertaining as they used to be.  i guess i'm turning into an old married lady.

assumably you've seen the pictures posted below and have either laughed or winced.  here is the story behind them:  saturday night kevin and i went to the plaza for a friend's birthday.  after awhile we decided to go to the arena to see the exhibit(s) play.  they were having some casting party for  hedwig and the angry inch  which eric, the lead singer, and carlos, the guitarist, had parts in.  they began to play several songs from the play and i really was not in the mood to be there.    barb, neal and i decided to make our way to bailey's.  when we got there i quickly realized it was not the crowd i was hoping for and convinced the two to go back down to the plaza.  after a few m
