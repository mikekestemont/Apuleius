I've always wondered what it would be like to be dead... just for a day.  Just to see what it would be like.  What heaven is like and what happens.  To see who would cry for me.  Who would come to my funeral... and how many people would come cause they actually cared, and who would come just to be nice, or because they felt they had to.  I wonder, who would be sorry, who would be happy, who would be miserable, who would be hopeful, or scared, or mad... And then I woder if that day was today, or tomorrow... what would people say? how would they react? how would I react if someone close to me died today, or tomorrow? All the unfinished plans, and crushed dreams.... I wonder what death is like.  I hate it when people are demeaning.  I mean, everyone is at some point, i guess, but I hate it when someone is like that all the time, even if it's not conscious... but I think it is.  Like, when you say something, and then they say something back to you like they're better than you, or their opinion's better... it frustrates me.  I wonder sometimes how many people really really care.  I wonder if when they say "you can talk to me", if they mean it.  There are people who want nothing more than to talk to you about your problems, but you don't want to tell.  And the people you do want to talk to, rarely even listen, or ask.  It must be about finding the person who wants to listen and you feel comfortable with...  this life business is far too confusing.
I am proud to announce that Ash and I are going vegetarian for a month... we'll see how it goes... big change, but still fun I think.   Auditions were today.  Mine went well I think... there were alot of really good people there though, so we'll see what happens I guess. So, if so many people think they have talent, but they really don't, how would you ever know if you were talented?  I guess just by what other people tell you... hm.  I was glad that so many people came out for musical.  it should (hopefully!) be really good. I mean, it better be if I'm missing Grease to be in it. I hate this coldness. I always think it's really dumb when people talk about the weather (cause i mean, really, it's a lame subject) but this weather is really something to talk about. Ok, the coldest place n the world? right here, right now.  That's creepy!  it hasn't been this cold here since 1966. that's 38 years! WOAH!  Ah well. Ihave 5 hours of choir on Sunday... I just pray that Ms. Voigts is in a pleasant mood for that concert/cantare hour. (Kayleigh, please!!) lol Well, tht's about it.  Going to do my math homework (gasp! ahead of time!!) Tip of the day:  Don't run on ice.
Yesterday Saskatchewan was the coldest place on the Earth. No jokes, it's a
