Ok today I have decided to set this up.   I work in Finance (yawn) but I have been working for the same company for years and I have come to the conclusion that if I hated it that much I would have left years ago, that said I am doing a degree whilst working and am looking to get out once I have finished.  So what happened to me today?  Nothing of note, really.  I have been looking around at quite a few other blogs, posting the odd comment and reading lots of funny and entertaining stories.  While doing my work, of course.  It is difficult to explain why I am laughing at my desk though when the odd person walks by.  Some of this stuff, on the other blogs is just plain nasty.  But strangely enough this is what I find the most funny.  What does that say about me?  So on with the day, I realise I haven’t said much, but I have a meeting until 7 tonight and I will try to update this more later.
Ok the title’s a little misleading, but in the end you see where it’s from.  But anyway I’ll begin at the beginning, a good a place as any.    About eight weeks ago, well ok let’s step back even further, to the very beginning.

I looked for one of the nicest (and most expensive, funny how that goes together) places I could find and low and behold I found one…..  A brief description for the masses, house….blah blah blah, and the draw card?  A fully fenced, large, solar heated, salt water, in ground pool……..  aahhhhhhhhhhhh.    So what did I do?  You betcha, I signed that lease.    So, I have never had a pool anywhere, the parents decided to get one put in long after I had left home, but luckily while my brothers were still living at home and my sister was just a glint in her parents eyes, so my fellow siblings could get maximum benefit from said pool (gotta love the parents).  But me, no.  I have no skill and very little interest in obtaining any for the sake of pool maintenance.  My step dad told me that it’s pretty easy and started in on a description…..blah, blah, blah. Yeah, yeah, I hear what you’re saying but I think I’ll just get someone to maintain it for me, and then I don’t have to worry.  He thinks that might be the way to go too, not of course implying that I am incapable of looking after it but with professionals, you know that it will always be ok….Yeah, THANKS.  So with this in mind and remnants of t
