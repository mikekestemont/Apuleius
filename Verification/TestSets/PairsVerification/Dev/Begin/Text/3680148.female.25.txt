The beers (Crest?) are on ice ... the Sloan tabs are being downloaded (and hopefully being learned!) ... the idea to top the T-Shirts is in the works ... as the water in Muskoka warms up and the boats are all gassed up ... it's time once again for the annual Sloan weekend. This year marks the 4th Annual and we are gathering more and more potential Sloan fans. Though I might not win any tickets and the chicken dance will most likely not make an appearence ... we will rock the dock just the same. So get excited now folkies!! Here are some memories from last year: (ok this is the part when I read the instructions about posting pictures I guess!!)
urlLink    Here are the masterminds behind the Sloan Weekend.  Jeff and I came up with the shirts, and they were big hits ... though I still don't understand why "Chester the Molester" didn't go over well.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    And here is the most excited of the bunch... my little sister.  Lyd - the fact that you sang along with every word and wanted to play cards on the dock with Chris only proves what a die-hard fan you really are!&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Here's Moonstone about to take a ride in Lyle's Circle of Death.  My favourite part is the googles!&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Here is the gang from the 3rd Annual Sloan. from left: Jeff, Ellen, Me, Lyd, Heather Moonstone, and Calvin below.  Missing is Angie who joined us later.  &nbsp; urlLink
I spent a wonderful weekend at the cottage enjoying the sun and somewhat warm weather (yeah for Canadian summers!)&nbsp; I have about a million new freckles, but in the processed burnt every part of my body (guess sunscreen was invited for a reason for little fair people like me!)   On Sunday I went for a round of golf with my dad at the local course.&nbsp; Tres fun but I was very surprised to see a golfer walking around the course with no shoes on.&nbsp; For a while they threw some shoes on for the greens, but by the end of the game the shoes were off for the entire thing.&nbsp; I would have complained about this class-less act to the Ranger or Owner - if it hadn't have been ME!&nbsp; (I guess this will teach me to remember my golf shoes next time!&nbsp; My feet are insanely blistered from trying to borrow my sister's shoes! haha&nbsp; But honestly it was the BEST way to play golf - so relaxing and so daring!&nbsp; Highly recommend it!&nbsp; My game improved because I was so relaxed!)   Thursday I had an amazing time out and about with the old gang for Edwina's going away party.&nbsp; It was so nice to see some familiar faces.&nbsp; I have some awesome pictures and I will post them as soon as our computer is back from the shop.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edwina's departure just marks another kid to leave the nest (Tara is already in Australia).&nbsp; Though Moonstone, Jeff and Liz are still here - they won't be for long!&nbsp; I'll miss y
