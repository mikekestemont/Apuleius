Okay, had the day off today *YAY*, so I was sitting here at my desk thinking "Wow, my blog is plain.  I should look to see what kind of neat and nifty things I can add to it".  BIG mistake!  I clicked and read... and clicked and read... and clicked and read... and at the end of an hour long session of staring at various blog pages and stuff, what have I learned?  Nothing!  Nope, nothing... it was in one eye, and out the other basically.  But, on the other hand, I came out of the experience with a nifty lil headache from not blinking.  Maybe some day...  In the meantime though, I can do a quick rundown of the characters in my life.    There's me, obviously.  Then I have my two SpztcKids from a previous mistak... err, marriage.  SK1 and SK2.  Also known as Nick and Brad.  SK3 is still in the process of cooking, but I'm sure she will be mentioned from time to time anyways, as she is wreaking havoc on my body!  LOL  I WON'T go into how she is doing that though.  But she is due to debut on Halloween, the lil diva!  Then we have SK3's dad... David.  We'll refer to him as SKSO for the time being.  He may become Mr. SK, but at this point, I'm still a wee bit on the gun shy side.  And we are happy in our arrangement of living in sin.  ;)  Then the peripherals... as I am sure I'll bitch about my family periodically.  My ma, pa, and sis live a few miles away.  That would be my younger sister, who is only 13, and a major pain in the ass.  But hey, it's cheap daycare.  I also have an older sister, so they will be the B's.  BS (sis), BBIL (bil), and BG1, BG2, BB3, BB4.  Two neices, two nephews.  Hope that makes sense.  Why the B's though?  They are fondly referred to as "The Beans" or "The Beaners".  My sister is half mexican (half sister too), and brother-in-law is full mex.    I may also refer once in a while to Max or Tigger, my cats.  Or my ex-moron, as he pisses me off on a regular basis.  Though with time, his names are liable to become quite inventive.  But for now, ex-moron works.  *takes a bow* And there ya go...
So, I'm enjoying my sleep, as I'm sure most people do.  It's one of my favorite parts of the day actually!  And of course, as has been the norm for a week or so now, it took me til almost 1am to fall asleep.  Bleh.  Then, of course, we add in being up what felt like every 10 minutes to run to the bathroom.  Finally about 5am, I lapsed into a nice, deep sleep.    Fast forward to 7am: "YIP YIP YIP YIP YIP YIP YIP" outside my bedroom window. ARGH!  Okay, this wouldn't be so bad, but the bitch owner did NOTHING to shut up this yipping piece of shit!  ARGH!  Not to mention the f
