What an exhausting day! Had ROTC for the second time at this new training centre (situated in the middle of nowhere at Don Muang). Had to do 30 pushups when we arrived off our buses, and was forced marched into the centre for about three yards before we were stopped and ordered to do 30 additional pushups---in the middle of the road. As we wearily trudged our way in, the drill instructors ordered us to do pushups again, goddammit.     Started the day off with a uniform-and-equipment check; 95% of the two companies were forced to do "excercises" for any breach of uniform regulations (untight boots, unbuttoned pockets, un-shiny belt buckles, long finger nails, long haircuts, noticeable moustaches, and anything else that one can think of).
Had the pleasure of meeting Boss and P'Yos today, after school.    A very fun conversation ensued thereafter with Ake, P'Yos, Boss, Kit, Boom, and me. Boss has gotten himself into what appears to be more trouble by enrolling into AP Mathematics as a result of one very ambigious exam, haha.
I hate Siam. I really, really do hate Siam.     It's  the  centre for Thai pop/teen culture, and it's where your average Thai teenager would go. One of the worst ordeals in life involves walking at  urlLink Siam  during "rush" hours on weekends, where literally hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of self-conscious, pop culture-craving teenagers hang out for no good reason. Just because you take Saturday/Sunday classes around  urlLink Siam  is no excuse to pretentiously crowd around the malls. Well, actually, that's not all that bad as it provides me and my gang some enjoyable people-watching sessions (which also provides a good conversation subject). What bothers me is the ridiculously large number of teens around.
Was a very tiring day, yesterday. Mad Jan's back in town, and so we set the meeting time at 2:30.
I'm writing this out of boredom, so bear with me...      Whoa. The newest supplement for that miniature wargames game,  urlLink Flames of War , is out, and, boy, I gotta get it. And, along with the book, comes a whole series of new figure packs to accompany the new Great Patriotic War craze.    I just can't wait to do Stalingrad and, in fact, the entire Eastern Front in 15mm. I know, I know, I have to get 20mm WWII, as well as 10mm Fantasy, 15mm Ancients, and the Physics done, but what can one do when one lives in a society where consumerism is propagandised through the various mediums (in this case, the net), encouraging me to buy more and more?
Chee's leaving for ISB (that's  the  Internation School of Bangkok, for those who don't know) and, as far as I know, won't be coming back. It's sad really, considering the time s
