I wish to diverge from my initial blog-plan for a moment to riff on the topic of sometimes boyfriends.  This is a topic I know a great deal about.  So you know that "friend" of mine in the last post?  Well, in reality, he is actually what I like to call my "sometimes boyfriend".  Basically, this means that we have a rocky relationship that consists of discussions every other week or so regarding the "state of our union" after which we either fight, argue, or break up.  After this unhappy period is over (anywhere from an hour to three days) we get back together and do the same thing all over again, finally deciding that maybe (it would be for the best) if we just had an open relationship.  And then we attempt to do this open relationship thing and be chill and less intense or whatever (even though this is pretty much totally the opposite of the way the relationships started out) and that's when the "sometimes boyfriend" thing starts swinging into full effect and he really becomes the "sometimes boyfriend" who you see "occasionally" and who may or may not call you when he returns from Turkey after hanging out with a really hot Dutch girl.  Sometimes boyfriends (once the "sometimes" swings into full effect and there is less of the rocky fighting bit) sound great in theory but let me tell you, they suck.  Sure, on the plus side there is no committment, sex when you need it but not when you don't.   And yes, in theory, with a sometimes boyfriend, you can be young, single, hot, hook up with other hotties, etc, but also have some stability; a nice guy you trust to fall back on.  But that is theory and theory is flawed. (And this is not just because those guys who you once thought were hotties and who you are now available to hook up with are in actuality just immature losers who put Tigi Bed-head in their greasy hipster hair and play the guitar for some half-assed band that begins with the word "The"). No, sometimes boyfriends suck because sometimes boyfriends are usually just confused messes who are using this sometimes relationship to take their confused mess out on you.    You see, from my experience, men have this Madonna/whore complex (and this isn't just lame grad school talk -- it is totally for real.)  They have to divide "sex" from "girlfriend" and when it starts getting all confused in the sometimes relationship (that they usually ask for) they lose the ability to communicate in any functional way.  In fact, they begin to resemble strange alien animals akin to those I've never seen in Australia.  They begin to make lots of bizarre yelping noises that they name "state of the union" discussions and keep making these noises over and over and over again so that you feel really really tired and worn out and start to think less clearly about everything in life just like them.  And because you are really really tired and w
