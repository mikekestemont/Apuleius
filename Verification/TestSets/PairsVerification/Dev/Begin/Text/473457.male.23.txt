Just the other day I thought to myself, "Mmmmm...I could really go for a gut box."  So I decided to create Gut Box Online, where we can all hang out, even if it's a virtual hangout.  So, just post what you feel like - talk about sports, good articles, pictures, whatever.  My thinking is that at the very least we'll have a place to laugh at each other...even more than we do now...
Mixed beer and liquor.&nbsp; Didn't have any water.&nbsp; Didn't eat anything.&nbsp; Bad Four....
As usual, good times in Belgrade Lakes, Maine.&nbsp; The Sunset Grille never changes, and neither do its patrons.&nbsp; A good time was had by all as we celebrated my 21st early on Friday.&nbsp; A local band (few of my buddies) came out and we jammed to a crowd in the lobby.&nbsp; Good times smoking Cuban cigars, having the occasional Purple Hooter, and just having fun in general.&nbsp; Check out the few pictures I have, hopefully more to follow.&nbsp;   HIGHLIGHTS&nbsp;OF THE WEEKEND:    My brother James gave me an embroidered that says:&nbsp; Matthew's 21st in&nbsp;Belgrade Lakes, ME - Raise your glass to all that came.  Karaoke at the Grille on Saturday.&nbsp; I sang  Mack the Knife ,  Baby Got Back  (which I dedicated to "those who couldn't come"), and  Jenny(867-5309) .&nbsp;  Connor, aka Frank the Tank,&nbsp;lost in a beer chugging contest&nbsp;with a girl!&nbsp; Actually, that was pretty odd, and her friend poured some beer on him...go figure.  Crazy drunk lady followed us home...kind of freaky...  Texas Hold 'Em, everyday!&nbsp; I won once, ended up +$10 on the weekend.&nbsp; Duda was the big winner after he scored the $200 pot on Sunday.&nbsp;   Keg of Michelob Light.&nbsp; Not quite Killians, but we all know what that does to people...we really don't need any holes in the wall...  Jamming on  Feelin' Alright  with Ludwin and Eli.&nbsp; Rocked out tune.  The numerous random Old School quoting, like when Ludwin popped in on Duda and I around 3 a.m. and yelled, "Hey everybody, we're going streaking!&nbsp; C'mon.....we're going streaking down through the quad!"   Quality stuff.&nbsp;  urlLink Check out the pics here .

Another fun-filled, action-packed day here at Florida's Most Convenient Bank....staring at signature cards all afternoon while answering phone calls from people who should know the answers to their questions already.  I've come to the conclusion that Bill Engvall is correct. Stupid people  should  have to wear signs that say "I'm Stupid" (or in my case identify themselves over the phone).   I'm waiting with baited breath for football season to start. I've got a rabid Fins fan here in the department, who I can't wait to start talking trash to when they start their N
