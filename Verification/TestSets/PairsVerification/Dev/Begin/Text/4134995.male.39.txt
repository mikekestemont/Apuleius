Felt like crap this morning, the thought crossed my mind on the way to work that it might me nice to wake up dead one day then I could get some rest ah well it will have later rather than sooner I hope {had some close calls tell you about them later}  They were meant to be pouring the concrete today at the school but as it was raining they did not.  When I got home I found to my dismay that the scanner did not work, and then I found out that the roof was leaking!  I have been stuck on the Service Rifle exam because of the defective scanner, so up loaded updated web pages to the 18 bn web site, I think the scanners power supply has gone on the blink its a HP scanjet 3200C about 5 years old.  Why do I feel so fucking tired?
Tuesday light rain today, no dramas at the school today but I was glad to get home. Got into my sleeping clothes real early. Was working on the service rifle exam and instructions for same and the dragon kept coming in the room and talking to me constantly breaking my train of thought. Long experience has taught me to listen to what she has to say and show that I am listening by ceasing all other activity. She was bringing me cups of tea, which was really sweet of her, and I enjoyed but I wanted to get something done before The Bill came on. She let me know when The Bill was coming on so I ceased typing and ensconced myself on the lounge 10 minutes into the show she starts vacuuming!  Some days I feel that she will not kill me but intends to drive me insane. Because she was going to work tonight I was able to get some of the service rifle exam and instructions for same completed. I did need the current Standard Shooting Rules so down loaded them from the NRAA web site but found that Adobe Acrobat reader was something that I had neglected to re install so I had to down load that as well took over an hour!  I also intend to scan and OCR convert the Fullbore Range & Butts officers exam and this with the SSR’s and a bit of cut and past magic will provide me with what I require.  I have also updated the NSDRAI OPM flyers so that task is complete though I must check with Max Johnson to see if he got some sponsorship so as I can put it on the major flyers.  Time for bed
Its been raining! Sandra my principal was meant to have come back today but has not I miss her something shocking. Cut up some timber of IA no cars are allowed to park in the front, as the cement for the building is being poured NOT they are just doing the form work!
