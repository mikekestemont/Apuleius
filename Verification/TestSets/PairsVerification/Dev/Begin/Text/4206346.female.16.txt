Amazingly better than you'd think. The incense, that is. John's almost done gutting his room. Removing his entire existence from the household. It's really rather depressing. I came home from work today to find a pile of stuff on my bed that he had borrowed over the years. Yoga books, green nail polish, and this lovely incense were among them. I just lit some... it's almost nauseating if it weren't for the headache it gives you. But it's a good headache... if that makes any sense at all.  This incense is making me dumber. That explains a lot about John... considering he used about 10 sticks of it. But that was back in his pot days.  Haha. Back.  I joined Girl Scouts. I amaze myself sometimes. But hey, we get to go to Europe next summer, so that's pretty cool.  Hopefully I can go visit David over winter break. That'd be so tight.  And hopefully Alli can still come out to visit me. That really needs to happen.  Peace out.
I hate this. Someday I'll figure it out.
I have hope!! I just remembered that today at work I asked Shawn if he'd be my freshman bitch this year. He said that Owen already called dibs on him, but that will all soon be changed *devilish grin* BUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  There is hope for my junior year of high school! And it comes in the form of SHAWN!
Okay, I'm seriously freaking out right now because it is just hitting me that ALL MY FRIENDS ARE GONE OR WILL BE SOON. NACHO I NEED YOU TO BE HERE  NOW ! Spinach is leaving TODAY. And it is seriously making me so depressed. Soon Johnjohn will be gone, too. There's like my two best friends in Truckee BAM gone. My only consolation is that Stoof has my email and promised to email me ASAP and Lauren offered up her dorm room to me if I ever wanna go down to UNLV to visit my brother. Oh Johnny-poo. If only you knew how much I love you and how much I look up to you and how much I want to be exactly like you. I miss you already!!!! With John and Stefanie gone, I seriously don't know what to do. David is in Washington. My pookie is in Minnesota. COME VISIT ME! I NEED YOU!!!! Nick and Jilly Bean are in Reno.  There's not anyone here in Truckee for me. Sheldon's cool, but we don't really hang out that much. And as glad as I am that Cassie and I are becoming friends again, it's just not the same. Everything feels so forced. Like tonight was cool and all... you coming over like back in the old days. But it just wasn't the same. I almost died when Alex called your cell phone.  I just realized why I dislike Cassie so much. She is everything that I wish my life could be. People call her all the time. She has an endless source of friendships to fall back on. I know that sounds totally bitchy to j
