Cicada Mania - so the first few weeks of May, the DC area is supposed to get the famous swarm of cicadas that rise from the dirt every 17 years.  Yes.  Apparently during this phenomenon (that happens ONLY every 17 years) swarms of crunchy cicadas rise from the dirt and populate the area to mate, eat, shed, and then die.  GROSS!  I don't know how I really feel about this.  I'm pretty grossed out.  Now I hear there are recipe's going around on how to prepare them to eat!   Here's a link to tell more and a recipe..... www.ubersite.com/m/31014

Ok, it's been 10 days and I've just decided that I'm going to start over.  I swear - this type of commitment is just like the gym.  Today's story is going to be about my trip to the mall to buy an outfit for this wedding I have to go to on Saturday.  Well really it's more then that...It's 3 weddings...and I'm so lost in girlsville about what to wear that I could scream!
Basically I spent the entire evening (5:30pm - 9:00pm Eastern) shopping at Pentagon City mall for the perfect outfit to wear to one or more of these weddings.  The only thing is - I didn't go in with a  vision.   I didn't have a clear  vision  of what I was going to wear at the wedding.  I could have gone with a nice spring dress or maybe black pants and snazzy shirt .....but then maybe black mini with snazzy shirt...or gosh even a classy trouser suit type thing.  Ugh!  So $113.39 later I came home with a pair of cotton khaki's, 5 thongs, and 2 bras.  NONE of which I can wear to this, or any other wedding.  (Well not as the outfit anyway.)
I think I'm going to schedule some "me time" over the next few days to figure it out.  Then try re-shopping on Thursday.
Huh...this whole blog thing really makes me feel vulnerable.  I'm not even quite sure that I'll tell anyone about this.  I decided to try it because I've had a few friends with them.  It's a neat idea - and I love reading thiers - but I'm not quite so sure people will really give a hoot about mine.  I'll think about it for a while.  Maybe see if I can keep it up.  I don't want it to be like a gym membership.
Had a great day....
Woke up at my parents beach house (well I drove there yesterday and then woke up there today) and hung around the house a bit.  Then the Big C (Caesar) asked me t
