I spent a lot of time today scouring through photo albums for pictures that I could use on my web site. I came up with about eleven good ones. I still incorporated all of them, but I definitely have most of them up. I also lengthened the section on my web site that kind of covers my past. That is where most of the pics went.  I also took the kids to go see  I, Robot . It was better than I thought it would be. The story was good, and it kept me guessing as to who the real bad guy was. The cinematography was impressive, and Will Smith was very cool.  I have had this crazy desire for Oreintal Chicken Salads from Applebee's lately. I have wanted one for a couple weeks now, so today I broke down and ordered some carry-out. It was soooo good. I'll have to go back next week.
I got quite a bit done today. I put enough content (including a message board) on my web site that I feel it is worth looking at. I picked up a textbook for my Freshman class that I am pleased with. I even got in all of my Bible study. I need to get serious on my syllabi pretty soon.  The kids and I had an opportunity to go out to lunch with Cindy today. All of us really enjoy that. Too bad we don't have more opportunites to do so.
Last night, my wife and I had a small argument. It wasn't anything big - we didn't even raise our voices - but it was enough to put me off of my game today. I have been cranky to everyone pretty much all day. I hate when I feel like this. Thankfully, Cindy (my wife) and I were able to sit down this afternoon and have a nice talk. Last night's&nbsp;discussion never even came up, but it helped just to have a cordial conversation.  I didn't get as much done today as&nbsp;I would have liked (isn't that always the case?). I went to pick up my class sets of novels from the distributor, but he didn't have any of them in (even though he specifically told me to come pick them up today). Instead, he told me they won't be in until late next week. He's a very nice (and talkative) guy, so I guess I don't mind waiting.   I was able to start my website and am very excited to announce the existence of  urlLink www.misterwoods.com . It won't be up for a couple of days, which is good because I haven't generated much content for it yet.  I also got some reading in and competently picked up my children from their respective camps. I haven't done my Bible study yet, so I better do that next.  This afternoon,&nbsp;I dropped by the school. I was hoping to run into Ms. Furnari (one of our assistant principals) to talk to her about getting a different textbook for my Freshman English class. Registration was going on, so i
