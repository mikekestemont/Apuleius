The rest of my family is obsessed with the once every four years snore-fest that is the Olympics, so the television is on almost 24/7. With the television comes the capititalist brainwashing technique known as the commercial. Though I try to avoid it, I sometimes watch the idiot box and so I to am unclean with the taint of consumer wants, at least for a few minutes, before I regain my common sense. There is one commercial that is pissing me off more then most lately. It is an Old Navy commercial, and it is definitely living up to the prior Old Navy comercials' annoyance levels. This one imparticular starts off in a classroom. The teacher is talking about history, when all of a sudden some girl jumps up and begans to scream about how much she loves history and about how we should all study. Scene change. Now there is a graph that tells about how Old Navy causes denim levels to rise which sets off you're savings glands or something of that sort, creating an ecstatic sensation at random moments. What the commercial doesn't tell you is that while you're buying clothing at great prices, (which you're not, if you don't know how to make your own clothing, shop at thrift stores, where there are real savings, plus, no money goes to major coroporations) you're supporting sweat shops, which is just modern slavery. Old Navy is owned by the Gap, which is one of the worst offenders of clothing workers rights I know of. Whole families, (including children) are subject to horribly dangerous working conditions, unfairly long hours, and extremely low pay, so the Gap's CEO and his associates can take long vacations and host fancy parties. Of course, the Gap makes itself look like it is the hero.      "Around the world, Gap Inc. has more than 90 employees whose sole focus is working to improve conditions in the factories that make the clothing we sell"         So, you have 90 employees who are suposed to monitor over 3,000 factories world wide? Wow, it looks like you are really trying to stop the problem. Congratulations, assholes.        Have we become so stupid that we will subject our fellow humans to horrible torturous cruelty just because we see a commercial with flashing bright colors and unoriginal pop music? Are we so brainwashed that we will continue to fatten the wallets of the heartless bosses because they tell us something is fashionable? Nothing like a large dose of capitalism and consumerism to rape the world and abuse the poor. Free yourselves and your brothers and sisters, stop supporting slavery and stop letting other people tell you what you like. Be creative, don't be part of the system. Demand change, if not for your your own benefit, then for the g
