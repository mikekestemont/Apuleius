I got over my slight hang over.  I spent most of the day chillin at Sam's.  We went swimming.  I got some more sun.  I'm starting to feel better about myself.  I'm excited about the move this weekend.  I need my own place again.  I just hope to God I can get a p/t job soon.  Hollis is driving me nuts and he's not even trying.  He changed and that's fine.  It's my problem for not liking the change.  It's not so much that he's become somewhat hedonistic.  Instead it's that he became hedonistic because he felt the world owed him a good time.  I think that's part of what just rubs me the wrong way about him.  I think he's sick of me too.  I shut out the world when the shit started building up, as I usually do.  I became anti-social.  I'm trying to change that.  I don't know how well our friendship will survive this.  It will get better once we don't live together, but I'm worried it'll never get back to the way it was last summer.  He hangs out with a lot of gay guys apparently.  He finds them amusing or hopes they might be able to advance his career.  I don't like that.  Maybe I'm just an asshole.  Actually, I'm definitely an asshole.  I can't help it.  I treat people in my personal life the way the world has treated me in general.  The world may deserve to be fucked over, but my friends don't.  I lash out at my friends instead of the world because, unlike the world, I can actually lash out and hurt them.  It's sick and disgusting and vile.  I feel bad for whoever winds up falling in love with me.  When I'm happy, I want everyone around me to be happy.  When I'm depressed or angry, I want everyone around me to be depressed and angry.  My love life isn't going to have a happy ending.  On a lighter note, I've come up the next million dollar idea: a massage chair that can give you a happy ending.  I also had a brilliant idea for a skit on SNL: a parody of the scene in PCU where the main character is remembering being roommates with the future head of the college Nazis, only the nerdy young Nazi role would be played by Michael Moore and the wild roommate committing youthful indiscretions would be President Bush; Bush would burst in with a "youthful indiscretion" and a bottle of tequila and Moore would be yelling "Shame on you!  Shame on you for invading my side of the room!"
Ok, so I wound up going to the parade and to South Beach afterall.  I caved.  It was just easier.  I met up with Aaron and his boy friend Jeff at Aaron's house and then we went to another Jeff's house in Montrose a block from South Beach and JR's.  Montrose Jeff was very nice.  He mixed us some very potent vodka drinks.  I'm still paying for it.  Also, there was a festering squirrel c
