dam you brand new, you always seems to make me upset, and yet i love your o so good music. anywho, the title says it all, it also a line from a song by the forementioned band. But yes, it seems i always end up thinking about 'her' somehow. And alot of the time all my conversations end up about the whole 'situation', even if i don't bring it up, someone will ask me about it. The thing is, it isn't even that big of a deal anymore, there was so much going on in like 1-2 weeks, and now nothing is happening. I can't get her out of my head, but it's sure to subside right....i mean i barely talk to her anymore, so eventually things will just fade away and i can get on with being alone...right.  bah...that is all.
SO, I finished my last exam today. I am confident that i passed the exam, but seeing as how i don't know what my course mark going into the exam was, that may be irrelevant. All i want is to pass. Having to take summer school will fuck up everything. I will be away, so i will not know if i failed the course until it's too late to register for summer school. Meaning i would have to take it next year. I already have 8 course next year, so my whole graduating year will basically get fucked up. Next year i will probably have to start doing my work. Which shouldn't be a problem with all my new found spare time. I mean, there isn't much to do when you don't have friends. But i won't get into that now. Well, summer is here, now for many bike trips and many days of fun fun fun work at mcdonalds.
i have come up with an ingenious solution to my silly little problem, ignore it. Now one might think of me as a coward, and i would assure them that they are right. But regardless of how cowardly this may seem, it also seems to be working. I can ignore the people that i long to talk to and it bothers me at the time, but afterwards i feel relieved, relieved that i didn't have to face confrontation. I am having such a lazy day, I turn my stereo on full, close the doors to my room, and just lay back and listen. From time to time i wander around the house, get some food, get confused when i see my reflection, before remembering i dyed my hair, and coming to the computer. I think i'll play guitar for a bit later. Basically, I'm just hanging around and paying no mind to any problems.
letting emotion weigh you down and hold you back in life. Like a ship at port that uses an anchor to settle itself down, emotions can hold you down in different situations in life. Knowing how and when to live in the moment and get emotionally attached is something we all must learn to do, so we c
