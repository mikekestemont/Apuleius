Renee' and I went to see  urlLink The Molly Ringwalds  at The Varsity.  I have to say that while there performances are always enjoyable, they have really come a long way since the last time I saw them.  Its been a couple years and they have used them well.  I liked their costumes better (especially pee-wee herman) and they seemed to have more fun together than they used to.  All in all, both Renee' and I enjoyed the show.    The best moment of the evening was from the opening act.  Lets just say that the lead singer of Lazy K learned a very valuable lesson tonight...if you are going to do a Michael Jackson dance on stage, make sure your pants will allow you to do it.  If they will not allow you to do the dance, make sure that you are wearing underwear.  Wardrobe misfunction??? We'll never know.
The first week of my internship went well.  I spent the week getting familiar with the company, how the audit department works and how the company is handling SOX.  All in all, I spent the majority of the week sending emails to the audit intern in New Orleans just so that both of us could look busy when we couldn't handle reading the current audit workpapers any longer.    Both Pascagoula and Gautier have turned out to be (surpise, surprise) a bit slow.  The highlight of my town experience so far has been the Treasure Hunt in Gautier.  Treasure Hunt is like a Tuesday's Morning, only with clothes and cans of peas instead of 1,000 different varieties of cheese straw mixes.  There were some interesting things there.  There were some down right scary things (read cans of peas) there.
Okay, So last week was my week from hell.  It was the fun kinda hell though.  I laughed more during that week than I have in a LONG time.  I will probably never look at flowcharting without seeing Curtis getting drunk in a canoe with a beer he was hiding from Dana or see a clip from "The Ladies Man" without thinking of Robert Lay. And I still have that damn Aicha song stuck in my head.  In case I haven't told you anything about that class, it is called Case Studies, but is really a class that focuses on presentation skills.  I had 9 presentations due in 5 days.  I worked nonstop from about 7 in the morning until around 11:30 at night.  I'm still dreaming about powerpoint and hand gestures.    I made the move to Pascagoula on Saturday.  I will be calling room 128 at the Suburban Lodge "home" for the next 3 months.  So far I've visited both Biloxi and the mall in Mobile, both of which are about 30 minutes away.    Work starts tommorrow and I'm pretty sure my dreams will quickly turn from presentations to SOX (sarbanes-oxley is the legislation that came about after the fall of Enron and Worldcom and the scandles with Tyco and is the main focus of internal auditing this year).  I'm looking forward to it b
