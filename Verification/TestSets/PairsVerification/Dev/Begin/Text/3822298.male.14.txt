Today we had combined activity.  Just the usual stuff (PT, playing games) but now with 02 scouts too.  Then there's something different.  Our science teacher, Mr Law Hock Ling, could actually  dance. ( btw, he's the head of the 02 scouts)    Trust me, I am not lying, Gabriel and Chin Yang saw him too.  He danced one song for an entire 6 mins (not funk dance, but live dance, well, pretty good anyway)  And that's our science teacher.  Cool.  The rest of the activity sux.  Cos it was pouring.  When we were playin' b-ball, it was like everyone was falling and the ball kept rollin' out of the court.  Some 02 sec 3s, like Cheng Zheng (or I think that's what he's called) were really rough.  Cheng Zheng created 2 long scratch marks on Nicholas Ong's face. When I say long, I say10 cm+  Talk about a  cat fight, lol.  Nic. Ong hasn't looked at himself in the mirror yet. Well, he should get quite a shock.
&nbsp; Holy crap! The sec 4s didn't hafta go away!  Stupid Lim Jee Nee our Head of Pupil Welfare just gave them a lecture!  SHEESH.
Aww... man... we have to go and cheer our track team in the national stadium on Wednesday.  Well, we could see tons of supporters, all from different schools. Then, the most horrid thing of all (it rained) Well, I didn't have an umbrella, so guess what happened. Then when it was all bright and shine, we went out. 20 mins later, it rained again.  Well now, isn't the sky smirking at us or something? The next time we went out again, the seats were all dripping wet, and the stadium seats are cleaned like once in a lifetime??? So the water soaked up all the dust and the crap on the seats and cloth sucks up water, see??? So when everyone sat down, our trousers became black.  Anyway, the main thing is that I wanted to get home at 7pm for dinnertime. And by the looks of it, the whole thing is most probably going to end at 7:30 (not to mention the long queue for the bus to get to the MRT and the mass scramble to get ppl out of the stadium) So, me and Nelson tried to erm... sneak off.  Thrice.  First time: We told the rest of the ppl that we were going to da loo. Then we met Aaron Tan and co. from 2L. Anyway, they were also keen on zao- ing too. So me and Nel went to the toilet and we agreed that we should try and zao. So, then we came out of the toilet, ready to walk out of the stadium with the 2L dudes when this prefect happened to be walking past. Then Aaron said loudly (oblivious to the fact that the prefect was a feet away) "Nelson, are you zao-ing? You want to follow us???"  In front of the prefect.  How stupid can one get?  Then Nelson replied (loudly) "Like that how to zao??? YOu want to zao you a
