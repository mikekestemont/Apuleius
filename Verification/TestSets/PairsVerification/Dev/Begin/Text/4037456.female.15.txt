Mayb I'm going mad soon? Haha,anyway, went out in the morning today. Didn't go for cca had important things to do.  Don't mind okie? I write song lyrics. Not really write lah, more like copy and paste.

'Coz I'm broken, when I'm lonesome And I don't feel right when you're gone away.  You gotta win, you don't feel me anymore.  The worst is over now, and we can breathe again I wanna hold you high, and steal my pain away There is so much left to learn, and no one left to fight I wanna hold you high, and steal your pain.  'Coz Im broken, when I'm open And I feel like that I'm strong enough 'Coz I'm broken, when I'm lonesome And I don't feel right when you're gone away. 'Coz I'm broken, when I'm openAnd I don't feel like that I'm strong enough 'Coz I'm broken, when I'm lonesome And I don't feel right when you're gone away. 'Coz I'm broken, when I'm lonesome And I don't feel right when you're gone away. 'Coz I'm broken, when I'm lonesome And I don't feel right when you're gone.  You gotta win, you don't feel me anymore.
