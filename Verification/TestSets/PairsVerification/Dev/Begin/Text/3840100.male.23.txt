Press Fanatic here!! Rick has just upgraded the studio and is finally able to get 100% out of it. We should be in for some interesting music for the next album after 'Off the Deep End'. I guess it's no surprise that Rick would switch to pop. His music has always had a dance edge to it since his dance club days. With 'Off the Deep End' finally ready to makes it debut there has been word that the produciton of that album took a very large toll on the musician. He hasn't said anything publically yet about the work, but we can expect a press release when the album is ready for release.  Rumor has it Rick has also been working on the side with his friend Victor who is a producer. We're hoping to get more on this soon!  Keep sending me your questions and e-mails at:  urlLink pf@rickkrenmayer.com
Hey there!  This is my first press release. I would have had one up sooner, but business has had me out straight. Yes the rumors are true about me heading into pop music. I've allways had an interest in pop and dance music over the years. So it's about time I finally head down that road for real. I have the most fun in that genre out of any other I find.  I'm still working on the finishing touches with the release of 'Off the Deep End'. I can't wait until it's out because I've been working on it far too long. It'll be nice to start composing happier, more upbeat songs than I have been. It will be a change, but it will be a nice needed change. I have to get back to work, but stay tuned. I'm releasing a new single very soon!!!  -RK
