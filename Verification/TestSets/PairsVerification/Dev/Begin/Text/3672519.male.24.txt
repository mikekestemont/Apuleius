"When you live alone, your furnishings, your possessions, are always confronting you with the thinness of your existence. You know with painful accuracy the provenance of everything you touched and the last time you touched it. The five little cushions on your sofa stay plumped and leaning at their jaunty angle for months at a time unless you theatrically muss them. The level of the salt in your shaker decreases at the same excruciating rate, day after day. Sitting in Sheba's house - studying the mingled detritus of its several inhabitants - I could see what a relief it might be to let your own meagre effects be joined with other people's."   - Zoe Heller, Notes On A Scandal
Today, we finally moved back to our old house, which we'd given the mother of all renovations. Finally, after 7 months in a cramped apartment across the road, it was good to be home.   I don't feel any sadness for the room in which I spent the last 12 years of my life - not only because my new one is bigger - but also because we did not move away. I'm now certain that nostalgia depends not only on time's gradual passing, but also on the sudden reality of a translocation. I'm full of shit.  Can't wait to get settled in!
Last night I went gay clubbing. I go once every year, and this time it was to check out the new Waterbar. It was filled with sinuous, muscular forms gyrating or posing to obscure trance, shitty techno, and the occasional overhauled pop/mambo - which of course got everyone wild, me included.

Dan was with me throughout the night. He breathed into my ear: "I'm allowed to have fun too." He's attached, and had way too much to drink. I count him as one of my closer friends.   He stood by the taxi as I closed the door, my head reeling and buzzing. Enriched by booze, partings take on a certain pathos. Having always valued his company, it felt strange to also enjoy his affection. But such intoxication is timeless.  This morning, he texted: "Sorry about last night. Had too much to drink." I replied: "No prob. Hope you had fun!"   And so life goes on.
My outing with David, Jeremy, Chris and Darius yesterday felt warmly familiar, yet strangely disconsolate. Through 7 years of differing timezones and diverging lives we endeavoured to keep in touch. But yesterday, for the first in a long while, we met at the Esplanade's Garlic Restaurant for dinner.  We recalled teenage school afternoons in Ghim Moh Mac's, wolfing down nuggets by the twenties. We gossipped about old classmates, hazarding their whereabouts. We grumbled about the food. We strolled along the windy river, down Millenia Walk, and ended up at NUSS Suntec for drinks and dessert. Finally, we found ourselves at Darius' house, giggling o
