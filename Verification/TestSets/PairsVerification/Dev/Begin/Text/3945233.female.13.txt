This is a program where you save animals, people,the world.  We need more people saving the world. Feed dogs veggies not meat  because what meat does is make dogs more savage and mean.  You can also start like a little liter program were you pick up liter from everywhere. You can also start adoption agencies because alot of animals are killed either because they are abandond or nobody adopts them or stray. SO BE COOL AND HELP THE WORLD!!!

You only have to gather them ONE time though. After you have collected all the map pieces you can "zap" one pet a day with the lab ray. The lab ray can improve or reduce pet stats. The lab ray can ALSO change your pets color, species, or gender. The only way a person can get a ROBOT pet color is by the lab ray.
