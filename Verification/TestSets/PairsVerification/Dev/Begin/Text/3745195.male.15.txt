Everything turned out fine. Yay for kyle.
Well through it all (my sister's grad party) today has been a pretty good day. I got to play disc-golf (my brother's portable thing), My friend got to come over even though he's grounded, and I got to see a couple of my favorite people (Alyson & Al). I love getting to see them and talk with them. They are like my other parents, but they're goofy enough to be my friends also [they're awesome!] So yeah I learned more about the "Arin's House" thing. It sounds really kool and I want to help out. Oh Oh Oh...  Invitations to some people to come hang out with me  [Warning: no one will probably see this so all these invitations are pointless, but then if you think about it so is this webpage. LoL] Any way the following people I have taken an interest in hanging out with them sometime [this means we all gotta do something and I'll find a way to get a hold of all of you and i'll figure out what we could do too]  The List Christine Eva Minh Nicole Haley Inga Scott McDonald Bobby & Kacyee Kirk Jessica  Lauren Erica Rachel Tracy Heather Kim  That's all I can think of for now. So I'll figure out something to do and makes some telephone calls and make it happen.  P.S. if you hadn't noticed most of the people on "The List" are from Westview... go figure. LoL.  Well talk to ya'll soon [i hope]  Catch you cats on the flip flop later (that movie never gets old)
Hokay so... today is my sister's graduation party and it will be pretty boring. Not to say that I'm not happy for her, I'm just simply stating my opinion of how it will be. I can say pretty confidently that it will be boring because I'm pretty sure what's going to happen. The adults will all talk and my sister and her friends will talk and my friend, (lives down the street) all he'll want to do is play or do stupid stuff and frankly I think I've been spending too much time with him... or too little time with my other friends. Either way I need to get outta the house sometime and just be by myself for the day. I would really like to go see that new movie called "The Notebook" ~hint hint nudge nudge [to any of you who would like to see it or would like to see me, but I'm guessing it's the first one]~ anyway if anyone wants to go see that movie with me give me a call on my wireless [wireless sounds sooo much kooler than cell] o yeah i guess you people need the number... wait who am i talking to? There are two possibilities.  Option 1). A 45 yr old man is reading this getting turned on thinking about raping me [eww] because he's a pervert... or  Option 2). No one is reading this in which case I would prefer this over option 1
