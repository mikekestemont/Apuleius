i saw some people that i liked just now.  one of them i can't see anymore, but the others are still quite close.  the first was the guy in the yellow shirt.  he walked like a kid 14 or 15 years old.  he was loose and unfocused and was smoking like he was proud of his cigarette.  he had a bounce and a slouch you don't see in white men his age.  he looked like he could still fuck well if he felt like it.    the other guy was a drunk.  we made eye contact as he was stumbling backwards to the curb.  he shuffled, took too many steps and caught himself before falling and then he saw me looking.  he thought he got away with it, but the truth was he was hurriedly trying to dodge a car that had no chance of killing him.  it must have felt pretty good to him though.  to dodge a car and the judgment of some square like that certainly would feel good.  i used to tell people that i had spilled gin on my clothes when i was inappropriately drunk in the middle of the day.  i thought i was hiding my drunkenness in this way.  it felt really good.
brisket is delicious.  i love well-marbled meat.   urlLink fat  is lovely when its well distributed and not too chewy.  i get the feeling that some people avoid fatty meats for reasons that aren't directly related to their health.  of course the texture of a heavily marbled cut of flesh does take some getting used to.  but most of the times when I see someone turn down a lardy brisket, they do so with a level of disgust that doesn't quite match the situation.  i think that the look of the fat has something to do with it.  i think that eating so many processed foods has left some folks skittish about some homely looking foods.  i also think that fatty cuts of meat are seen as low class.  sad.  it must have sucked to be jack sprat.  he had a big fat wife and no luxuriously marbled meats.
i wonder if  urlLink Douglas Hofstadter  is cool.  GEB sure is dorky, but you never know.  that is a pretty bad haircut though, and the achilles and the tortoise stuff is so incredibly smug.  he's probably not cool.  i bet he is pretty happy though.  annoyingly happy.
urlLink these new army uniforms  are pretty sweet.  so futuristic and creepy.  i firmly believe that a military should look as creepy and frightening as possible.  the new camouflage looks so digital.  it looks like something from lawnmower man.  i hope we're going to start sending troops into environments where this stuff is useful.  those pockets look great too.  i used to have an old mannish coat with regular pocket and slanty ones like on the new unis.  those were good pockets.  i consider myself a bit of a pocket connoisseur.  i have worn otherwise uncomfortable or unfashionable garments for years strictly based on the pockets.  i don't know i
