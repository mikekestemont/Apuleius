In all oddness, I think the dude is a a true one-woman man. He can't deal with more than one female friend at a time, evidenced by his lack of presence these past few months (ever since new girl entered). Wonder who he'll get next...
Jam went off with a few hitches, but we got everyone in to play who wanted to, and everyone in to watch who wanted to.  There were a couple of people who didn’t get on the list, and then some who said they’d emailed someone and were told they were in. Well, you got in, and that’s great. Just remember, I’m anal, and when a message goes out saying to email a specific address, email that, or have a friend email it with your name. Emailing someone else and having them say you can come ain’t gonna cut it. You know why? Cause the person handling reservations won’t have you, and you’ll be waitlisted just like someone walking in the door.  I know one person sent her email to the wrong address (she wasn’t in the inbox), which is sad  and puts her in the mistake category instead of the not paying attention on to how to make a reservation. The latter irritates me since at least 37 other people figured it out.  Super mellow super angsty today.  If I don’t mellow out I’ll freak out into hysterics over the backlog and quit.  Bad idea. A few more months, then change. I’m very combative today, resistant. The weekend was so fun and so different. I don’t like being here one bit. Geez I suck at dealing with stress. Run away, run away!  Blah.
This is some  urlLink fucked up shit . Good going for the girl though for not giving up.  There really are people who need to be put away forever. Why the hell people can't see that, I don't know.
I am so angry. Not grrr angry, frustrated angry. I don't know why I came here to post, since I can't really vent here with any specifics. Grrr. Damn it.  Lots of heat, nice thunderstorms.  Let me think of a metaphor. I'm in a car. I'm a passenger. Someone else is drivign. I switch cars often, always otehr drivers. I have a pilot control of my own, but I like the company.  The drivers are eager to arrive, but they don't take the best routes, drive to close, too slow, and are just plain annoying to ride with.  You'd like to yell as they get passed by a better driver in a crappier car, but then they'll fuss at you being a backseat driver or ask you to take the wheel. And well, you still just have your learners permit. This is big city traffic.  The other doctor thinks it's a stroke or brain tumor. My orignal thoughts too. She had surgery for essentially breast cancer a couple fo years ago, and has a little growth on her mouth (a tiny nubbin, nothing nasty) that came back.  Her back legs don't even work now.  I hope m
