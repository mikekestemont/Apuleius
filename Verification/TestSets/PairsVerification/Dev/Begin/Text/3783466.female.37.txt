urlLink I have to share this sight .  It's nothing but lost photographs people have found.  Believe me, it's a lot more interesting, and sad, and bewildering, than it sounds.  Just keep scrolling.
So, today I was in Left Hand, West Virginia.  It's a bit off the beaten path, but the people have great gardens and I mean everybody waved at me as I drove by.  So I'm driving and I see this strange little animal bogeying down the road.  It wasn't a dog, but it was like a Bassett Hound in that it was mostly feet and no legs.  It was the furriest thing I think I've ever seen.  So I asked the woman at the Exxon gas and deli (Hunters Welcome!) what that hairy thing is that runs so fast and looks like an otter out of water.  And the woman (who also thinks that Alabama is the prettiest state, by the way) says, "Oh, that's a weasel pig."  Of course.  The weasel pigs.  Learn something new everyday.  By the by, I think  Weasel Pigs is a good name for a punk band.  Also, the woman at the Exxon gas and deli (Hunters Welcome!)says that the Amish make the best cheese.  I think it's my responsibility to pass these things along.  If you ever get to the Exxon next to Left Hand, they have great burgers.
The vast majority of people are friendly and mean.  They like to have a cup of coffee with you and know where your from and what your daddy does.  These same friendly people also think it would be fine to get rid of fill-in-the-blank group.  Queers, drug addicts, prostitutes, Arabs, immigrants, Jews.  Whatever group they don't consider themselves to be in.  Most people would wave and cheer at the box cars full of people as it left the station.  The thing is, is that I've been letting that slide.  Somebody says something appalling and I think in my head, "Holy Christ, what a fascist!" but I don't say anything at all.  I'm going to be more objectionable.    I don't want my tombstone to say, "Here lies Jill.  She was nice."  So listen, I'll call you on your blind spots, and you call me on mine.  Deal.

In May, I planted some snapdragon seeds in a little pot to keep in my hotel room.&nbsp; It was my first foray into the plant world.&nbsp; Previously, I had&nbsp;only watched&nbsp;plant die before my eyes (did you know that one does, in fact, have to water a cactus?).   Anyway, they out-grew the first pot, and I replanted them into two pots which was nerve- racking because I thought they could only be out of the pots for seconds before they died, so I was in a big hurry and got potting soil all over the hotel floor, and then when I thought about it later, I realized it made no sense to treat them like f
