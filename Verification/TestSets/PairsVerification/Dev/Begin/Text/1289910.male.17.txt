just watched mean girls yesterday and it was a fun movie. not only because of the story and humorous language but it was because of lindsay lohan!i dont know what happened to that girl... from a young, innocent girl from parent trap she turned into this teenage sex symbol in mean girls. well regardless on how she changed, it was all good and im lovin it. she's so hot...hehe        i just thought while watching the movie... do you really have to be mean in order to fit in and survive?   in my case, im not really a mean person... ok maybe a little but my meanness is tolerable, i think... but anyweiz, i think with my happy go lucky, wild personality im showing everyone, the onlye thing i dont get is R-E-S-P-E-C-T... i dont know but its such an issue to me. if getting 'mean' means people will be afraid to mess with you and will earn you respect even in a negative way, i'd rather be mean! maybe im just so tired of being the butt of 'some' (not really 'all') jokes. for years now its always been the same, im the tall guy with the big nose with all the 'kabastusan' in mind, who prioritizes extra curricular activities more than the academics.. a class officer who tries to lead a class who find it so hard to pay repsect and listen... the misunderstood son/nephew or black sheep rather in the house who would think first of his friends welfare rather than himself. and the person (or is it animal?) who always has a smile on his face which is an irony of his true emotions.   well there is no one more to blame than of course myself because whatever it is happening right now is a result of all my actions. i let it happened... and i cant just go blaiming other people for my own stupidity. people disrespect me because that is how i showed my personality. do you think if i just shut up and isolate myself from all of them, they will still do the things they do to me now... of course not... sometimes its better not to exist i guess.   im just hoping that the next time someone even tried to mess with me i could channel all my anger and just explode. its hard keeping it all inside you know...
we had our first general assembly today at mediartrix. it was ok. we have a chance to interact with the new members. i wouldnt say that it was very organized but we managed to survive and went on with the GA. we had some difficulties with the venue since the guard is asking for a formal letter. thnx to kapatid na sam and we succssfully reserved the AVR which is a better venue compared to the origibal one which is only a room. the GA couldve been better with some performances from dang and ate joy but ok na rin yung kanina... i do hope that the new members enjoyed it.  &nbsp;  mama c
