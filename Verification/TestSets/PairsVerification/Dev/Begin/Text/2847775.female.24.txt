Chris felt a subtle vibration, removed his cellular from his front pants pocket, and adeptly flipped it open with one hand. It was Niki calling. Curious as to what she wanted, since her table was only thirty feet away, Chris answered the call.  "Come into the men's room on the side of the bar now," Niki whispered.  "Are you ok?" Before he could finish, she hung up.  Mitka stared across the table at Chris. “Is everything alright?"  "Umm…yeah. I just need to use the men's room. Be right back." With that Chris clumsily pushed away from the table, knocking his flatware to the floor.  Quickly slipping through the maze of tables, Chris walked toward the restrooms. As he passed the bar he glanced at the left side of the restaurant and saw Vaughn seated alone at a table.  "Damn, that dude is big." Chris thought as he walked on to the men's room.  He now realized how one backhand had done so much damage to Niki's face.  The guys hands were huge!  The hall leading to the restrooms was even more dimly lit than the dining room. Not seeing Niki, Chris whispered her name as his phone vibrated again.  "Come into the men's room, silly."  "What are you doing?" He said as he pushed open the door featuring the sombrero-wearing hombre.  "Second left, last stall."  Walking around the corner to the second corridor of stalls, Chris stopped in front of the last stall. She opened the door and pulled him in.  "What are you doing in the men's room?" He was now more than a little annoyed.  "I didn’t think you would come into the ladies room." She was smiling, exhibiting her trademark dimples.  Chris' annoyance faded as she smiled at him. The bruises that had been purple-black last weekend had faded yellow by now. Makeup effectively camouflaging them; the marks were now noticeable only because he knew they were there. Thinking about the bruises, Chris' anger flared at Vaughn, but also at Niki for being here with Vaughn, and because she hadn’t called him back Wednesday night.  "He was at my house Wednesday when I got home. He was waiting outside in his car. He switched duty with his roommate. So I couldn’t call you, obviously..."  Standing this close to her, he could vaguely smell Dr. Pepper.  “So what’s up?” Chris asked, impatient now.  “I just wanted to tell you why I didn’t call you back Wednesday night. You think I am stupid, don’t you?”  “No. I don’t.” he said, although in reality he was thinking: “Yeah I do, young and stupid.”  “Are you on a date or something?”  “Yep.”  “How’s it going? She looks boring.”  “Hard to gauge, since I am here sharing a stall with you.”  “Oh.” She quickly leaned forward and kissed him sweetly, almost primly. “You better get back to your date then.”  “Why the hell did she do that?” Chris thought.  “Vaughn will begin to wonder why I’m not back. He’s leaving tonight. Enjoy your date.”  “Why the hell did you do that?”  “It w
