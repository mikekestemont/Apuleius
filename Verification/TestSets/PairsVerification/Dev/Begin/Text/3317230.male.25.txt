Hey hey, it's been a while, I've been FreeBSDifying Chris's computer after realizing that Nortonifying it with w2k made it unusably slow. So F it, screw windows, there's nothing it can do that freebsd can't do better.. Wait, let's just shorten that down to "There's nothing it can do."  So, what have I been up to besides computer stuff... Well, I took a stroll down Hennessy Road, walked into 298, and didn't ever want to leave. This is the biggest computer mall i've ever seen. It's an entire mall, just selling computer stuff. 3 floors! It's insane! And the deals! Oh my god the DEALS! It's got to be stolen. It's just gotta. Stuff that would sell for $150 maybe $200 in Canada, is like $8 here.   They've got alot of stuff like that here, I was shopping for shoes with Chris in Mong Kok, we turn a corner and walk into a shoe store, nothing exciting so we leave... I spot another shoe store across the street. I must have looked foolish when I mentioned "Hey, there's another shoe store across the street." To which Chris just said, "Yeah, but there's another one right here."  "Waaaaiiiit a minute.... *eyes shifting suspiciously* ALL the stores on this street are shoe stores!" "Yes, this street is called Shoe Street"  I thought that was a neat little odditty.. But then, the next time I went to Mong Kok, I walked down "Fish Street" which consists of all pet stores, mostly tropical fish stores, and then down "Flower Street" which was an entire street of just flower shops, and finally down Wedding Dress Street..  There's also a brothel street...  But I saw a FISH WITH HANDS!!! IT HAD HANDS!!!! NOT FINS!!! HANDS!!! And the fish itself looked like a rock, but WITH HANDS!! I'll try to find a picture online of this fish, it was amazing.  Mong Kok, I'm told, means "Place where there are too many people", and that is an understatement. It's crazy. And I haven't been there on a weekend yet. But, it's the best place to shop i think, everything's pretty cheap, especially if you're looking for knock-offs.  However, if you're looking for knock-off watches, just walk down any road in Tsim Sha Tsui for about, say, 3 meters, and (especially if you're white) you'll have 3 Indian guys in your face screaming "Fake Rolex? Gucci? Tag? Gucci? Gucci?" But once you escape them, there'll be another 3 that are trying to make custom suits for you. I understand that they offer cheap suits, I understand that $70 is a good price for a suit, I understand that, I get it, Yes yes, but I don't want a suit right now, no, no I don't want to go see your pushy tailor who will demand that he take measurements right away, no, i'm going to the museum, i don't want a suit, no, come-on dude i'm not insterested, no, no, no, FUCK OFF!!  Oh yes, and I'm quite upset about the lack of Tazo Chais at Starbucks.     San Migeul t
