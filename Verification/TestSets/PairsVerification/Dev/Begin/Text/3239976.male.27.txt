bought slippers yesterday.  those kinds usually worn by mountaineers like myself.  i liked it by the way red and blue and black splash their pizzaz on the strap.  still a bit foreign with my sole though, but eventually, it would have to groove.    i told ninin, that it would be some kind of a ritual of sorts to get the slippers.  a kind of making the feet more able to go forward, to explore new nooks and crannies, to run and walk and to visit more interesting places.  and so it happened, yesterday and the next few days would certainly be that.  lets start off with yesterday. well yesterday, i watched shrek2 with tatit, ninin and mehane, a whole lot of laughs.   siguro mababaw lang talaga ko...  but the new thing there is a phone call from an old friend in manila.  she felt so warm and i kinda missed her too. those things that we used to talk about.  brought back a lot of memories.  is this my feet's way of telling me of possibilities?    but no, maybe not yet, not all adventures are worth going into... at least not yet. :)  but before i went home, went to mts, well to drink coffee and read saturday's paper, by myself.  twas musicians night at taboan and they were in the side, as i buried myself with old news and new harry potter showing trivia.  to do something so alone has not happened recently.  i felt solitude, being nameless, faceless and anonymous.  new feelings, but good feelings.  today, a monday, i started with a little bounce, for i have resolved to let things the way they are at the office.  i can never change agnes' style.  i should just shut up (like dilangalen) and just do my job. and still support agnes with the stuff she should be doing.  maybe instead of writing this blog, i should already burying myself at that pef proposal.  and tomorrow, i move to my new room! excited, anxious, but looking forward to more adventures for me and my new slippers.
yey!  its friday!  i join the workforce in celebrating and regalling the best day of all!!!    never mind if i had no breakfast... i usually dont have time for it.  never mind if te baby is all fumes because of me not coming early (...enough).  she isn't very welcoming in the morning when you come in anyway.  never mind if my neck feels a little bit strange and i have to crink it every so often.  never mind if the pef proposal is still proceeding snail's pace, i am still trying to understand how it goes anyway.  never mind if the 10th year celebration is not in the consciousness of people in the office, at least when somebody asks me what to do, i have something to show.  never mind that we still have to do 5s later this afternoon.  for today i have no plans...  never mind that i feel so shitty about work.  i'll probably be moving on next year, or earlier.  this i
