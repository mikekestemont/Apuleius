I can't wait for the table tennis match this afternoon. Will Singapore's representative, Li Jiawei win? I really wonder. Anyway, I hope that she does because, it's going to be of great significant to us. But nevertheless, she has done a great job and has done all the Singaporeans proud of her. Way to go! I was looking at her on tv yesterday and I realised jing fang was right. She really is indeed wearing alot of accessories, the ear rings, the necklace and the ring. I suspect the ring is her engagement ring. Wow. And the TV like purposely zoomed in to her precious ring. I wonder how much it costs, with all the shining and all that. Actually, it's hard for a sportsman to be so feminine. Don't you think so? Look at the others. They don't wear all these fancy stuff on their body. And they look so boyish. Not like girls at all. So, I envy her for being so sporty yet still so feminine. Double-sided. That's cool. =) Anyway, I hope she will win a medal for Singapore. We'll always be behind you.
I just want to add in something. I miss you alot. Time really flies. Our four years in Temasek is going to come to an end. It's so sad. I will miss the school alot. But most importantly, it's you who will bring back all the happy memories for me. The memories will always stay in my heart. Forever, ever.  P.S Good luck Li Jiawei! You can do it! Don't be too affected. Work hard for the next competition! Way to go.

1. When girls say something, they usually mean another in their heart 2. Girls are very emotional and cries easily 3. Girls are very sensitive 4. Girls are aware of the surroundings and take note of very single little details 5. Girls want all the attention to be on them 6. Never ever comment that other girls are pretty in front of the girl who likes you 7. Always say i love you to the one you like. =)  Lesson learnt: Never tie your hair too tight or else.. it would be very ugly and very painful. Like what I am suffering now. Or else, your hair would also be like abigail's hair. It's just too tight.
