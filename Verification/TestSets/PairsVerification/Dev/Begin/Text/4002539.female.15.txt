This is my first Blog.&nbsp; I'm guessing you are suppoosed to treat this as a Diary.&nbsp; I know that people treat their diaries very differently, but mine is just a log of my thoughts.&nbsp; So if you find something insulting, I ask that you please forgive me.&nbsp; I live in Minneapolis MN, I'm 15 years old, and I currently am going into 10th grade.&nbsp; I am Dating a Senior in Highschool who I care for very much.&nbsp; I nicknamed him roo, quite teh oposite of him because he's 6' 3" a foot taller them me.&nbsp; But I'm tigger and Tigger and Roo are best friends, so I figured it would work :)...  I want to show you guys some of the things that I write, so that you can get an idea of what goes through my head...Then I won't feel bad if people think I'm crazy for my writing, because At least I will have given them fair warning.  this is a story that I am in the middle of writing.&nbsp; It is going to be a long short story, but that is fine, just as long as it comes out properly  &nbsp;       Within the Next Three       It’s interesting when you’re at the end of something and someone asks you to tell the story of how you got there.&nbsp; Do you start at the beginning and tell the story as it progressed?&nbsp; Generally that is how you would proceed...but when the beginning doesn’t make sense until you know the end, and the end is too vague and complicated without the beginning and the middle.&nbsp; Then, you must start in the middle.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Starting in the middle of the tale, with “a day like any other day” does nothing any justice.&nbsp; I personally have never experienced a day that has been the same as any other.&nbsp; It’s like trying to say identical twins are the exact same replicas of each other.&nbsp; If anyone has passed a day that is the same as “the other day” I would love to meet them and tell them what a boring and horrible life they live, for if you have the privilege to be free, then you should take it.&nbsp; However, there is a period in the year that time ceases to exist, and it is when my ailment started.&nbsp; During that season...summer.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the summer, as a teen on vacation, time lacks any type of its natural flow.&nbsp; Everything becomes a blur of which day, what month.&nbsp; Day becomes the time where you sleep so you can go and play at night.&nbsp; And when you play at night, what you do doesn’t matter.&nbsp; There are no rules, no boxes that the rest of the world has to live with.&nbsp; Some of us hunt, others drink, and there are many of us who search for substances that only make the mess of their minds worse.&nbsp; In truth, none if these things pertained to me.&nbsp; I was freed like all of the others, cut loose from the chains that bound all of us.&nbsp; We w
