Hey Class,   In case you'd like to have a link of some or all of the class linked to your blog (like mine), here's the code you need:   &lt;h6&gt;Class Blogs&lt;/h6&gt;   &lt;ul&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popaganda.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;Trena&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  then copy the following URLS (addresses) into the portion of code above which matches & the name where Trena's name is -- before the /ul tag (underline):    http://www.dustin-ebay-mediaclass.blogspot.com  -Dustin http:// pattyannblake.blogspot.com  -Patty http:// sunkistsands.blogspot.com  -Heather http:// centerstage777.blogspot.com  -Brittany http:// aliciahatton.blogspot.com  -Alicia http:// joshanderson.blogspot.com  -Josh http:// katieisperfectineveryway.blogspot.com  -Katie http:// tracysblogmedia.blogspot.com  -Tracy http:// tgoveonemedia.blogspot.com  -Terrence http:// stoogess1.blogspot.com  -Amber   the other option is to  urlLink EMAIL ME  and I'll just copy the code for the whole class into an email for you & you can copy it.  The things that you should recognize about the code above is that you can use it to insert  urlLink HYPERLINKS  into your blogs anytime you want to.  the &lt;li&gt; code is for LINES and the &lt;a href=&gt; is the linking code.  Of course this isn't for the class -- it's just for those who are curious or risky...  peace~
............................... setting up your blog ...............................  hey y'all -- welcome to this crazy new world of BLOGGING!  I've included some links over on the right hand side of the page for you to explore if you're interested in the phenomenon of Blogging.  But reading those links isn't a requirement for this class.  Setting up your own blog IS.   So I'm going to devote the remainder of this blog to explaining to you HOW to set up your blog.    1.  You may want to be able to continue to read this page WHILE you're setting up your blog -- that way you can read this list *&* follow the steps simultaneously.  SO, go up to your FILE menu and select NEW WINDOW.  2. in your new window address bar, type in the following URL:   www.blogger.com  3.  Now you should CLICK the "start now" button in the middle top of the page.   4. Filling out the form should be standard for you -- I suggest that your USERNAME be a name that you use to sign in with other accounts (so that you won't forget it) -- the other boxes are self explanatory.  Make sure you click the TERMS OF SERVICE box before you click NEXT.  5. On this next page you may name your page anything you like -- and you may describe your page anyway you like.  I always say that the simpler -- the better.  At the top of my page -- you can see (me)dia -- that's the title I chose.  The next bit -- "Andrew blogs publicly about media."  that's my description.  You can go back and change these anytime, so don't spend too much time thinking about it...click on public blog (so we can read it -- you can make your own private one some other time...)now click NEXT again.  6.  Host it at blogspot. NEXT  7. You have to come up with a URL name.  That's what you'll type into the bar above in order to get back h
