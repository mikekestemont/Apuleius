so i had applied for a job as the admin asst for the VP of corporate sales & i didn't quite fit his bill. which i didn't really think that i would. admin is not the role that i really want, i was actually trying to catch the eyes of those around me. make them understand that i'm not going anywhere in this department & i want to further myself along within the company. so i feel like i've accomplished my goal & I'm happy instead of being sad about being declined for the position.  it's all good & it's a 3-day weekend. yippee.   here's to remembering our heroes overseas, our veterans of wars past & our brave fallen soldiers. happy memorial day weekend.
i just  LOVE  my current job!!!
so i'm getting something out of the q&c 'stash' for two of my "teammates" and one of them says to me, "are you of celtic decent" and i'm like, "well, kinda, yeah". and he's like, "i dig your rings." and i say, "then you'd appreciate my tattoo." he says, "you'd appreciate mine as well, then."   we go on to discuss where they're located how big they are & what not. i was so happy to hear this from him. he had made a comment to me earlier on in the year regarding my celtic necklace (that has recently broke, but that i'm going to fix VERY SOON). so i'm glad to hear that there are others that appreciate & truly take in their celtic heritage and are proud to show it off with body art.   dammit i gotta get back to see Josh soon. i've been putting it off & i know what i want, but i need to get him to truly put his mastermind behind the design & layout. argh!  that is all. slainte!
just got back home from flying with marshman. left from chesterfield, went to dinwiddie for a landing, then went back up east followed 95 to follow route 288 all the way out to short pump, then back for a landing at chesterfield. the sun set early behind thick clouds in the west. it was still gorgeous. a bit hazy at times, but no real big deal. haven't been up since late march & it was a blast to go back up. marsh is a great pilot & very descriptive in what he's going to do. i even got a chance at the controls, but that was kinda giving me a heart attack, so i made him take over again. went to Ledo's for dinner & had a killer cheese steak sammich. now back at home & it's time for "beddy bye".   XOXO - 10-4, Good Buddies.   Co-Pilot Kellfire
