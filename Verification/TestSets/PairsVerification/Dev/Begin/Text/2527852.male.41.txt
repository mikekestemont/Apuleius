It's not about what you get (from the world), it's about what you add.  I received this  urlLink Suggestion  on the first  snowman  day of 2002.  I was in a good mood because I knew my kids and I would probably get out and do some snow sculpting when I got home.  I had already seen some kids up (7:00 in the morning!) planning their snow creations.  Half way through my run, I met two kids (3 & 5 years old?) who didn't even know  how  to make a snow man.  Their dad looked on while I taught them how.  They were really excited when I told them it was up to them to decorate their snowman. Only the  urlLink PBGs  could arrange that my unique talent would be useful to give joy to those kids and to bring that family together that snowy morning.

Sometimes the single act of a rescue which doesn't seem to have any redeaming
qualities to it at the time may be that wink from a stranger that becomes a sign that there is a bigger picture than what we see. Who knew that my friendly smile in church to someone I don't feel comfortable with all the time would lead in a small way to that person getting baptised? In some ways I think
it would be better not to know how a small action can ripple into something larger. That you could get a woman to smile at all in the midst of an angry, tragic change may be the angel in you reaching out to comfort her when she
needed it most.

Oh, I agree completely. I thought it was nice of the PBGs to arrange
that she be there for my baptism too. She seemed even grumpier yesterday. But, my helping her out may have touched her on a deeper level and who knows how long that 'infection' will 'fester' in her heart. It is my job to be me and do what I do and let go and let God after that point. I have to focus on what is my job and let others take care of there own lives. I have decided that I am a servant of God and that I must do what is in my God madate (from either his Calls (can I have an unlisted number please) or from my own feelings of 'right-ness') for every decision that is presented to me by life. If the call is to go to Red Deer to help out a friend, I go to Red Deer (if Mo lets me to of course). In short, you gotta be true to who you are. Period. Oh, and listen for that small  urlLink God voice . That is important too.
