I've really taken off on this story. My profile includes a random question to answer - mine was, "The children are waiting! Tell them the story of the frog and his wig," or something like that.  I worked on it the first two days, and I know what I'm doing with it, I just need to finish writing lol.  It's taken a turn I hadn't expected at the start, but I'm happy with it.  It's shown I have talents for writing other than depressed poems. However, I might have to edit the story in order for some friends to like it.
I'm at a weird place.  I know I'm at a weird place.  For months I've been likening myself to a piece of gum. Ie: A kid takes a piece of gum out of their mouth and stretches it. The gum is now spanning one hand to another, with a clump at either end.  I resemble this because I'm feeling pulled into Chrisianity, and feeling pulled into the secular.  I like my music, but I like the peace I know He can bring.  I'm at a very weird place; I totally believe the Bible and agree with the principles and theology of Christianity, but won't 'succumb' to the urgings because I want to keep some things in my life.  I think music is my biggest thing.  Modern rock, for the most part, isn't following Christian guidelines.  There are some pretty good Christian bands - some have made it big (Evanescence, Switchfoot, Chevelle) but there's so much more selection in the secular.  I don't like being where I'm at, either.  Part of this (I'm paraphrasing) is my being uncomfortable with the statement, "You cannot serve two masters. Be hot or cold, cuz if you're warm, I'll spit you out." Ooo. I also don't like the indecision, and angst over trying to decide one way or another. I want to love him with all of my heart... but I like what I have now as well. Everytime I go to church I feel a pull - I've felt a presence - and then I come home, and do things that totally negate that. I'm kind of just watching myself wander all over the sidewalk right now.
exactly how you wrote it (you know who you are)  gaining someone else's job well done is the only compliment good enough for ur job well done, so how is it, that something that u can produce make more, yet something is more, if energy cannot be made or destroy'd but merely change form, then it has to b E=MC², that the universe is an nearly infinite M=mass, n therefore, has an infinite E=energy, with the power greater than light, (agrumentively god's best creation). so the miracle of the universe, is the ability to live, the way to rather energy, that is so much, so easily, when making E=MC² energy, it takes a lot of energy, but dense, to make more energy, the E=MC² energy cannot be control'd as easily, but just released, meaning we would eventually run o
