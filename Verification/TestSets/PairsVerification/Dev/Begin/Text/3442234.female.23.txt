Friday afternoon I went up to Dorchester for a Grad Party.  It was a good time.  I knew quite a few people there, a lot of math majors showed up.  There was a cookout, some beer, and the Red Sox on TV.  Apparently my new drinking habits have gotten around.  This guy Mark walked in and said Sara, no drink?  I was then offered a beer, which I turned down to his suprise.  I don't know where he got this idea from.  {Oh yea, that one Wed. night.}  Anyway, I had a beer a little later, to which he smiled, and said "ummhmm, she's starting"  We watched quite a bit of the game, and then around 10:30 headed into downtown Boston for some dancing and fun.    This only reinforced what I already knew to be true: I am not the club kinda girl.  We took two cars to this other girls house, and then we piled into her Mom's van cause paying for parking is obviously cheaper in 1 car than 2.  Something you never have to think about when going drinking in Dartmouth.  We parked in a lot, and then walked around looking for a place to go, and getting lost in the process.  It seemed to me like we were walking around in circles.  We finally found this place, I don't remember the name of it, but it started with an A and the name was 4 letters long.  We paid the $5 cover charge.  {I know!  WTF?}  Only to find the place was not that cool, with no dancing, and many guys in there that were balding.  It took me forever to get a drink, but as soon as I got it I was informed that this place sucked, something I already knew, and everyone was ready to leave.  They told me to chug my drink, a screwdriver.  So I drank it really fast and we were outta there.    We found this other place Sissy K's or something like that.  We had to pay another $5 cover.  They had food and a bar on the first floor, but we headed up to the second floor where there was a DJ, dancing, and another bar.  We headed over to the bar and before I knew it I was pulled out onto the dance floor.  I was going to argue, being the non-dancer that I am, but I didn't.  This girl Anna and I started dancing while the others got drinks.  They soon joined us and we had a party going.  And yes, it is very much out of my character but I danced (for the whole time we were there too).  I was not a fan of the perfumed smoke that blasted into my face every once in a while.  But I was a fan of the drinks they had in test tubes.  A lady came around with a tray full; I asked the girl who drove to pick a color, she picked blue, so I had a blue one, very tasty.  So much in fact I had a
