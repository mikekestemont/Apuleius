The human mind is strange...When there's no work to do, people crib and complain that theydo not have any work but when there's work to be done, the same people crib that there's too much to do. Strange!!
This is my first blog...am not sure what to write...will keep putting up what ever crosses my mind every now and then.  Sure the Blog page name's corny! Couldn't think of anything else...
Am back after a loooooong time!!  Saw  Lord of the Rings-Return of the King  last week...got totally bowled over by the graphics...Amazing stuff! The only thing that left a bad taste was the ending...the film's maker(s) haven't done much justice by cutting out details!  Have been so fascinated by LOTR that I have started learning  Quenya , the Elvish Language...let's see how long my enthusiasm lasts!
"Debates and discussions cannot prove the truth of life. Only experience can. You know whether the shoe fits you, only by wearing it."    Beginning to realize the true value of this!!

Am not sure what to put down...just felt the urge to put something on this poor long-neglected blog.  Frankly, I am not too good with words. It seems so much easier to talk and express yourself...but the downside is that you do not have the permanence of words.  Say something today and you forget it tomorrow... there  are  times when you would rather forget what you said ... but I digress...  Well, you write down something today ; probably when you read it after some time, it would bring back memories of things that happened when you wrote that...  I ought to blog more but most times I have no patience to clear things up and put down my thoughts as fluently as other bloggers do...  As they say,  Practice makes perfect ...people, expect better blogs from me in the future
Another one of my favorites by Robert Frost...   Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,   And sorry I could not travel both   And be one traveler, long I stood   And looked down one as far as I could   To where it bent in the undergrowth;   Then took the other, as just as fair,   And having perhaps the better claim,   Because it was grassy and wanted wear;   Though as for that the passing there   Had worn them really about the same,   And both that morning equally layIn leaves no step h
