Well, today was certainly interesting. Me and Alyson met Tony and went and saw "The Village" which was amazing. I thought that it would be kind of campy from the beginning, but the movie got really good and it turned out to have one wicked twist. We saw Sarah today...at the movies. Today really proved to me that things between us will never be the same. First of all, she didn't even notice me and Alyson sitting outside the movie theater, waiting for Tony, until I said something. Then, she didn't even bother to stop and talk, but rather walked on by and had nothing to do with me. Afterwards, we talked for like five minutes, but it was a wasted effort. She didn't want to talk to me at all. You know, I at least tried to be friendly, tried to show that I could be the better person, just as Alyson did, but it was all fucking useless. I don't know why I bother trying to be friends with her...it's like trying to be friends with a fucking brick wall. She can talk to me on the internet and email me, but she doesn't want to be near me in real life. What kind of friendship is that? There is none anymore. The next time I talk to her, whenever I decide to, I'm going to tell her that I quit the coven. I can't handle being linked to her when she doesn't even want to acknowledge my existence in front of her friends who she seems to like better than me anyways. Makes me fucking sick.  ~With this knife I'll cut out the part of me, the part that cares for you~ -Smile Empty Soul "With this Knife"
Have you ever just hated someone, hated them so much that it drained everything you have and left you feeling empty and cold? That's how I feel right about now about my parents...I'm not used to playing this whole "backseat to what I want" thing. Lately, all my parents do is go out and spend their money on drinking at Ya Ya's...not even seeming to care that we are sitting here waiting. Why is it always about what they want? I mean, they can't even fucking take responsibility for their own kids. It seems like all the kids in my generation have parents who, plainly put, just don't give a fuck, and then they wonder why we're all so fucked up in the head. They wonder why their kids kill themselves, or cut, or start doing drugs and drinking...it's all just to kill the pain. My mom has even started doing it...she was always home and always there, but now...she would rather stay up there at that fucking bar then come home so we can eat. Money got shitted down the hole to pay for their bar tab, and they wonder why I keep getting depressed. I have to worry about whether my younger brother is going to eat dinner that night, and whether or not I'm just going to d
