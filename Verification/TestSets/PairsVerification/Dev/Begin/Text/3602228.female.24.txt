Somedays you just need to sit back with an old friend and get re-aquainted. in this case it was my old friend Jesus & Mary Chain. I hadn't really listened much in the past couple of years, but today. Sitting alone in this apartment. Bored with what i was working on. I dug out the old tracks and got fun. Head On...  Oh yeah, hey America... this shit isn't gonna work. Consider Iraq a lost cause. Way to go, you fuckups.  Why can't i be a stronger cartoonist? Designing superheroes is hard work when you cant see them shits standing in front of you. perhaps i need take about five or six different hallucinagens and call it a day and let those superheroes find me.   PS. Spiderman 2, you better be special.   PSS. The trailer for the movie "SAW" on IGN.com is fucked up.   PSSS. Is it possible to have three PS's?
The UK Apple store is the new US Apple store. And pink is no longer the new black. in fact black is the new pink.   "Lost"... oh robert smith. how do you keep doing it? so amazing.

Okay, so putting together a literary journal with a soundtrack from various bands that I've toured with, or befriended or whatever should be easier than this, but lo and behold i am the worst fucking procrastinator on the planet.   oh lordy... but the submissions. they are very entertaining. and the early layout of this thing is very, very pretty indeed.   oh wait, i never posted that last post regarding this whole thing. long story short, i am working on a literary journal. taking s
