Well I just got home after a full day out in the city...    AND IT WAS GREAT!    The yoga class a T's gym as excellent, I liked the instructor and he definitely helped me in my form (I was as bad as I though, but I definitely lack upper body strength).   I am definitely going to continue with yoga. After the class, we went and got some Tasti DLite (New York, Seinfeld, or SITC!) fat free frozen yogurt.  It was a beauiful day and we decided to stay outside.  I haven't really gone ALL over the city...so T took me to SoHo, Chelsea, around Bleecker, and the Village.   My mom sent me some recipes and a large chart of common foods with their calorie, fat, and carb contents...very interesting...so on the way home, stopped by a veg stand and got some grapes, plums, and cilantro...I didn't know an apple had over 40 grams of total carbs...raisins have over 32 g.  That's crazy!  So I decided to get some better fruit choices. Well tomorrow is Father's Day...I'm about to soak some cod for dinner, do some yoga, and go to the gym for some strength training.. *~Besos*~
I have read (and my friends and mom have told me) its good to keep a journal while on a diet/exercise program.   However, I am WAY too computer dependent for that.   So I decided to have this blog serve as my journal.  It may be more difficult for me to slack of if I'm publishing my progress all over the internet.

Besides, maybe I can help just one person like my friends and mom helped me....I also have a tendency to start things then stop..So maybe this blog will help me grow in a couple of different ways :)  It's now Friday, 6/18, I just came back form the gym.  I actually did 30 minutes of cardio (YES I'M SHOCKED) and got in a little work on my triceps and abs before the gym closed.  In addition, I walked to the gym and back.   THIS IS BIG FOR ME.   Normally I go to the gym str8 from work, so I only walk home.  But every extra step is helping me shed this damn weight.  Even though I'm doing all this (it snow been a little over a week), I kept thinking about my center.  I have not felt this good in years, but I kept feeling like something's missing.  I've also gone walking ( at a fast pace) in my neighborhood, walking to [places I used to drive to thinking they were father than they actually are.  My goal is to get to the gym Mon, Wed, Fri, and Sunday morning...and try to walk after dinner on Tues and Thursday.  After reading a lot of books and info, I'm not so picky about what days I go...as long as I get my ass there  (MESSAGE).   I remember a
