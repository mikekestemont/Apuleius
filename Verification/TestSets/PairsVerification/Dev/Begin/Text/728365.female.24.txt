I've had a very momentus week. I just found out today that my girls are giving me a party!! They are so funny because they told me they are giving me the party and where and they said invite who I want. So we are going to Bailey's Bar and Grill for dinner dinner and drinks and pool and fellowship and then we are going to  urlLink Clifton's  in Raleigh for partying and ignorance. I'm excited!!!! I love my friends, they are so good to me.     "I'm leaving on a jet plane, don't know when I'll be back again"
11 more days. I had to say my first "good-bye" today. It was very hard and I even cried a bit. Its not like I'm going to be gone forever but still you never know what is going to happen. G is a great person. So patient, so talented, so kind...just an all around good person. Its funny that he things I'll lose contact with him but I don't think I will. People come in our lives for reasons, seasons, and lifetimes...I think that God will determine which applies to our friendship. Safiri Salama G, there will be no colored in stars, okay?  I found  urlLink this site  that is the answer to my prayers!! I've been looking for something like this and finally found it. Last night, I bought a  urlLink camera  (35mm) and a  urlLink portable cd player  . I also got a case for both and batteries. I'm pretty sure that I have everything I need now. I've been on the verge of tears all morning because I am rackin' my brain  trying to figure out how I'm going to get all the stuff I have over there with me. I have more stuff than what we are told we can bring, I don't know what else to do...  I have a busy week planned too since this is my last week in Chapel Hill. Tomorrow-a have my "date-night", Tuesday-Hanging with Tracey during the day and 'Benah that night. Wednesday-Lunch with Shawn, Movies with Wayne, Thursday-Kyoto's with Lessie!!! And I still have to make sure that I have all the paperwork I need and all luggage packed. Its going to be a long week.     "Waiting for tonight...OOHHH!"
There are times when I'm really glad that I'm anal. I went to the  urlLink Midway Airlines  website and what did i find? That Midway has shut down AGAIN!!  I bought a flight on there Monday night for $44.50 to DC. This is the same flight I will be taking to my Pre-Departure Orientation...and now the hassle is on me to find another flight. The web says that I have to go to the Midway ticket counter print up a paper ticket, then go to US Air and get them to accomodate me. I guess they are planning a merger, but its a headache for travelers. The good thing is, I'm not leaving for another two weeks so I have time to do this. I have my linesister's car for one more day. I
