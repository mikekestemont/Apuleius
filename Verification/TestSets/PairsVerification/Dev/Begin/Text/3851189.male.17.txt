yeah~ silver jubilee has started.. my day started as early as 8am this morning -.-" (to think that it's a saturday). anyway, i helped my brother to deliver the paus to AMKSS.. imagine carrying 16cartons of paus, containing 1600 different kinds of pau.. wow, tts madness.. L0Lx.. but nvm, my dad still enjoys donating it to e school.. hee.. weirdly, i made 3 different trip to school today.. first was e delivery, second was e company terence and thrid was to meet mel n yL.. haha, wateva it is.. it's a great event thats happening again in AMKSS since Millienium Carnival =P following that, we had proceeded to Marina Bay to enjoy our meal with drew n his friends.. although e closeness of the cliche that we formerly had, the atmosphere there was still great with a new bunch of guys, marcus they all ? haha.. and 1 interesting thing to note! drew burnt e aluminium foil right from the start when he placed his food! haha.. wat a loser! but wateva it is, its his b'day celebrating.. all in all, a great b'day to drew if ya reading den ! enJoy! goTta wake up tml early again to play soccer in school.. l0lx.. cyA guYS!
apart from the previous, today is in fact a great day.. life is no longer boring.. haha.. needless to mention, the daily routine still goes on but schooling is much more interesting now with optimisim.. take it that i'm a bad boy, i've been skipping classes as easy and as convenient as i like.. but dun be mistaken.. i know my priority right.. taking into account the disastrous teachers(not all) whom may take away my precious time, i might as well relax myself at home or go for a swim(which i just had one).. 20laps, not alot but still good for a start.. months since i last swam and cool enough, i managed to keep it under 40mins for 20 laps.. tt means 2min/lap.. wahhaha.. tml's AMKSS silver jubilee le.. kindna hectic but i needa go back.. not due to any specific reasons, but juz to pay my tribute to my school... its AMKSS tt has brought to me thus far.. (for u guys whom do not know bout' my past, forget it den! haha) let's cheers and AMKsians, enjoy yourself tml ! Cheers !
for no special reason, it has been a tiring day for me.. day was as per normal without much progress nor any interesting thing stuff happening.. its all about waking up at 6.30am, going to sch to attend lessons and den get back home after school.. wat's much better rather than attending schools? ... desperately needing a guiding star which can truly motivate me to study ;).....
a short yet long day.. irony is e word to describe.. nothing beats having a seat in the cinema, enjoying ya time.. life's just too boring man.. school ends at 1215pm when we celebrated my classmate's b'day.. yeah, 1215pm! a short day.. but yet its boring.. stupid timetable having 3straight lectures followed by a tutorial a
