I wrote a big long blog and then somehow deleted it! So this is all you get for today!
They turned off Aaron’s stomach pump last Wednesday or Thursday. But they haven’t removed it yet. They want to make sure he doesn’t get nauseous before they take it out. But it has been a few days now and I think he’s doing fine. I didn’t feel like doing much this past week. Didn’t feel like working either. But I made it. I guess I just haven't been getting much sleep lately. Kevin and I went to Rod’s last night. Today, we’ve just sat around the house. I just don’t want to do anything!
Man! Did I ramble on yesterday or what!  1. Now that food has replaced sex in my life, I can't even get into my own pants.   2. Marriage changes passion. Suddenly you're in bed with a relative.   3. I saw a woman wearing a sweat shirt with "Guess" on it. So I said "Implants?" She hit me.   4. I don't do drugs. I get the same effect just standing up fast.   5.

How come we choose from just two people to run for president and 50 for Miss America?   15. Isn't having a smoking section in a restaurant like having a peeing section in a swimming pool?   16. Why is it that most nudists are people you don't want to see naked?   17. Snowmen fall from Heaven unassembled.   18.

I signed up for an exercise class and was told to wear loose-fitting  clothing. If I HAD any loose-fitting clothing, I wouldn't have signed up in the first place!   21. When I was young we used to go "skinny dipping," now I just "chunky dunk."   22. The worst thing about accidents in the kitchen is eating them.   23.
