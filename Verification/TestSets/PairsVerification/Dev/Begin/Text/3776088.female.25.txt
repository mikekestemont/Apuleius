I'm sure we've all heard the statement: "I just don't understand where little Johnny gets all of his energy from!".  Well, I can explain it to you very simply, as told by grcmnky to me.  We are all born into this world with the same amount of energy, only children have smaller bodies which require less energy to maintain them.  Thus, they have all that much more to burn.  As for older folks; the older you get, more energy is required to maintain your body and keep it running.  Therefore; adults seem to have less energy than children, when, in fact, we all have the same amount.  It's all relative.
As I've gone through the years as a parent, I have come to realize that many parents are germaphobes.  That is all good and fine, to an extent.  Keeping a child from touching things like raw eggs, raw meat, and dead animals makes a lot of sense to me.  However, freaking out if little Johnny touches a grocery cart that hasn't been cleaned; plays in the mud; sticks his binky or sippy cup back in his mouth after it hit the floor; chews on the neighbors dog; plays around children who have a cold; or doesn't wash his hands every thirty minutes, well that just doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.  Yes, I recognize that being clean has it's good points, but there is a such thing as being too clean.    I know we don't want our children to get sick or injured, but I feel that protecting little Johnny from everything in the world is actually more detrimental than letting the child be.  Our bodies need to be exposed to germs and bacteria in order to learn how to fight them off.  Often times an illness will be harder on someone who catches it for the first time at an older age than if they had been exposed to it at a younger age.  I would rather my children have a tough and strong immune system than to be knocked down by the simplest thing.  The best way to build up a strong immune system is by allowing exposure to minor things here and there.  My mother has a friend who would freak out in his daughters first two years of life if anyone was around her who had a cold.  Her immune system stinks because of that.  My husband, on the other hand, has been exposed to a lot of nasty things in his life and he's hardly ever sick.  My way of thinking has made people raise an eyebrow or two to me when we're out and about.  Just a few weeks ago Mugwump dropped her sippy cup in a restaurant.  It didn't land on its spout or anything like that.  The waitress looked at us like we were from Mars when we declined her offer of washing it for us.  The cup didn't land in anything nasty, I couldn't see the point in washing it.  We also don't use anything to cover the table b
