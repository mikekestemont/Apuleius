Reflecting on that horrific deed where friends become taunting rapists and homosexual at that, I must say that getting elected as Drum Major or Band Major is not a good thing because it is almost certain that you'll get gangraped. Even the great Dictator Rim Jia Chen got cold feet. Brr....
According to howie, my blog sucks because there were no links and very few posts. So I must post more often. Something remotely interesting happened in band prac today. The Sec 4 ex-Drum Major and ex-Band Major were er... gangraped by everyone else. I, however was but a curious onlooker so I cannot to be blamed. It was the Sec 4 farewell party, you see and my seniors wanted to see off my senior seniors with something grotesque. According to Jie Han, a Sec 2 senior, this gruesome deed happens "almost every year". Their clothes were torn off and words were scrawled on their chests with markers. Both their trousers' zips were spoilt. They were hysterical and it was the first time I had heard anyone shout so loudly. Some perverted fellows went so far as to take pictures with their handphones. Urk.  Sick , right?
Today Hiippy was very angry at the so-called "evil" people who filled out Doofus' survey because they all wrote "Han Chang/Hiipy/IHC/HC loves you/u/CK/chermaine". Whatever. But hey, he just doesn't want her to know that he likes her,  right ? Anyway, got my term progress report today and my MSG improved by 2.3! From 5.17 to 2.83! Yay! I'm euphoric! Hard work pays off at last! Baargh, band later at 2.45. Damien (my SL) says that its the Sec 4 send-off day so no practice and hopefully, no PT! We also get an early release thanks to Family Day. Yahoo! 2.45 to 5 compared to the usual 2.30 to 6.30 is a lot of difference indeed. Can't wait to get home, got to pack my bags fomr my Trenggannu trip and check on my Utopian provinces to check they haven't died and I don't have to create new ones. Matter of a fact, I have to put them on Vacation mode as I'll be away for 72 hours and a province ungoverned for 72 hours is a disaster waiting to hsppen.  More on my Trenggannu trip. That's in Malaysia and further north than KL. Its an overnight trip in a coach. Going diving again. Hope the chalet won't be as crappy as the last time in 1999.  That's all for now. Won't be blogging for a long time too...
A new personal blog after the Orc Haven has been taken up for my journal. Hope to post more often. Long live Thrall!
Nothing much to say today unless you want this blog to become a Utopian update. Provinces jumped in networth, Kevalinor, my WOL account jumped from 121k networth to 136k while the other, Kevalinorn (pretty unoriginal, wot?) rose from 52k to 57k. Kevalinorn's in  big trouble while in my WOL kingdom, we're preparing for war once more. Piano lessons fairly routine today, did ok. Band tomorrow, baaargh.
