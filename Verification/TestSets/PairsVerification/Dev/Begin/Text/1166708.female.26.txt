Kill me pills   So here I am at work bored out of my skull and all I have to do is sit here and get paid.  Most people would probably love that, but I on the other hand, hate it with all my life...................
confused   I have no idea how to set up a comments section..........who would have thought that this would have been hard....why didn't anyone warn me.........
I was wrong....   I thought that when I would start this blog I would have a mouthful to say.....I have nothing but a broken heart......
ok first posting, my friend has made me her offical private investagator........YEAH for me!!!!!!!!!!
Well here I am with my first entry.  I have nothing to say right now.
V-Day Sucks    Although I am part of the majority that has a boyfriend, I still hate Valentines Day, and I have ever since I was 16.  I used to think that it was because I was single, but then when I had boyfriends on that day I still hated it.  Then I thought that maybe it was because I wasn't "really" in love with them.........................but now I do LOVE him (my current one) and I still woke-up hating today................oh well............where's the tuna..................oh nevermind........carry on.............
well 25...........   well this weekend I turned the big 2 5, and I feel that I have been brought to a crossroad and I have to make a decision, should I stay or should I go????  I need to move on to bigger and better thingsm and I need to do it soon, cause 30 is only a few weeks away seeing as the years will just keep coming......
it's my party and I will cry if I want to, cry if I want to..........    you would cry too if you were turning 25!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  tear
OH MY GOD......   well now that the day has officially started (I just had a coffee) I can rehash all the mishaps from last night and laugh.....What can I say, we are funny funny girls!!!!!!!!!!  Do to the high volume of birnocular (not sure how to spell it, but I know how to use them) use I find that I have become used to seeing things up close and personal and now I find that seeing things in regular vision is just not the same........So who are Mary and Teresa you ask, well they are just about as real as Nancy, Todd and Scott.....again what can I say Private Investigating is in our blood........and remember blood is thicker than water........
PICK UP THE PHONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
that awful feeling in your kidneys   whenever I think of my ex-boyfriend I want to barf........what does that mean???
