i've been reading a great book the past week called 'making the corps' by thomas e ricks and he's made some really great points about the military and civilian life.  most of the stuff is great and i agree with it, like "there is, of course, much in american society today deserving of dismay."; "changes in society have helped widen the gap between it (society) and the military." and "american society has become more fragmented, more individualistc, and arguably less disciplined, with institutions such as church, family, and school wielding less influence."  i couldn't agree with that more.  i remember sitting in school in the 2nd grade saying the pledge of alligence.  you don't see that today.  you're lucky if you see an american flag inside any school now.  yeah you see them outside, but i don't remember seeing them inside when i was in highschool.  i think that the quote that i most agree with most is "starting in the mid-1960's, we have thrown away the values, morals, and standards that define traditional western culture.  in part, this has been driven by cultural radicals, people who hate our Judeo-christian culture.  dominant in the elite, espically in the universities, the media, and the entertainment industires (now the most powerful force in our culture and a source of endless degradation), the cultural radicals have successfully pushed an agenda of moral relativism, militant secularism, and sexual and social 'liberation.'  this agenda has slowly codified into a new ideology, usually known as 'multiculturalism' or 'political correctness,' that is in essence marzism translated from economic into social and cultural terms."  as far as political correctness goes, you never used to have to worry about that, but now, that's all you think about "will i offend someone with what i have to say?"  screw it, who cares, if they get butthurt, that's their problem.  people that take their freedom for granted and don't care about the military piss me off.  if it wasn't for the military and the thousands of people that died, you wouldn't be able to say what you want.  God bless the US and the military.
well, i just found out what kind of friends i have out in california.  people like to use you and abuse you, and then when you're not needed/wanted they ditch you by the side of the road.  why are people like that?  don't they understand that in a place like we're in the only other people you have to support you who are close are your friends?  you would think that after 3 1/2 years in this place i would learn it's every man for himself, but i guess i always try to give people a chance.  someday i'll learn.  i miss the old highschool days when my best friend and myself wouldn't do anything with out eachother.  if we had a problem we'd talk about it, work it out, and in the end would end up closer than before the problem because we'd understand eachother better.  the fact that we're both Christians helps, but it shouldn't m
