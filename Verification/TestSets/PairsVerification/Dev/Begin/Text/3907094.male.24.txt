Even without Lifehouse Jason Wade writes great songs. Like this one from the shrek soundtrack.  You Belong To Me   See the pyramids along the Nile  Watch the sunrise from the tropic isle  Just remember darling all the while  You belong to me   See the market place in old Algiers  Send me photographs and souvenirs  Just remember when a dream appears  You belong to me   And I'll be so alone without you  Maybe you'll be lonesome, too   Fly the ocean in a silver plane  See the jungle when it's wet with rain  Just remember 'til you're home again  You belong to me   And I'll be so alone without you  Maybe you'll be lonesome, too   Fly the ocean in a silver plane  See the jungle when it's wet with rain  Just remember 'til you're home again  You belong to me    Its great...trust me. But not as Good as Everything by Lifehouse now thats a love song, maybe one day all good men will find someone whos their 'Everything'. Happy listening.
I'm bored so if you have an amusing rant/story then stick your comments here please!
