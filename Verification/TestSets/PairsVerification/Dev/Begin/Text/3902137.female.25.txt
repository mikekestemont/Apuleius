Once again, my intuition comes up trumps!   I received an email today from  MH , apologising for taking "two eternities" to reply to my email (and still not actually replying); telling me that it was just because he was feeling bad when he got back to Sweden (what's your excuse now *sob* ?!); making sure I did not think it was because of the me and  Mni  thing (I did suspect it, as I confessed in an earlier post); assuring me that he does "care" and thinks I am a "GREAT" person (his emphasis); unashamedly teasing me about the possibility of us meeting up in Paris (my ultimate dream and boy-does-he-know-it); and promising to write properly "pretty soon" (with a smile and a wink, like I should be expecting him to take two eternities again).   Things I did not like about his email:  1. Referring to  AB , not by her name, but as&nbsp;"slutty girl", when in fact, he actually slept with her two hours after meeting her (I should never have invited her to that party, why do I always have to be so nice?)  2. The fact that he doesn't mention that he has a g/f (I think he has, he's not a laster and I heard that he had a g/f maybe 3-4 months ago? Unless it's a new one who is NOT a journalist...pls God?!)  3. Not signing off "love, M" like I did when I signed off my email.   Things I loved about his email:  1. Signing off with /Monsieur "le plus grand slacker" (o√π est-ce que on dit "dans le monde"?)  2. Mentioning once again the "rumour mill" an anglais expression which I taught him and which I hope he will remember me by...  3. He asks that I not be too dissappointed in him for not&nbsp;keeping in touch&nbsp;(how could I be, you gorgeous man?!?!)  4. The fact that I am still on his mind, I sent him the email on July 20, and it's now July 27... yay for being on his mind.   I think&nbsp;I will&nbsp;SMS him now, he deserves it. But I have to think about what to write. Maybe something like:    The rumour mill seems accurate, will be in Europe in 3 weeks. Great to hear all is good with you, we have so much to catch up on, thanks for the email, love&nbsp;v
I am trying to piece together a wardrobe for my trip overseas. Since I seem to lose all my to do lists written on paper, I thought I might as well post it here ;)  1. Reheel my Diesel heels (they never last more than 3-4 wears but i love them to death) 2. Buy the new Wonderbra ($50) from BNT 3. Buy some Nivea Q10 skin firming lotion (also useful for point 4) 4. Get tan passes (will 3 do?) 5. Pack, pack, pack: so I know what I will need to buy before, during and after. 6. Buy ceramic tongs (this is very very important) 7. Buy shampoo and conditioner replacements to take w/ me 8. C
