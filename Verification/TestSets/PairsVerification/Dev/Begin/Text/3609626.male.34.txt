Friday night, Ian had the first class of the new session of karate (he's currently a 3rd degree orange belt).  During each session, they earn stripes for showing proficiency in forms, kicks, and defensive maneuvers.  Ian got his tape for defense in the first class!  He's never earned a tape that quickly before!  Saturday night, he stayed over at Debbie's house along with the girls.  He had a fabulous time (of course!).  He had wanted to get to Debbies as soon as he woke up Saturday morning.  It was hard for him to wait for the evening.  While Ian and the girls were at Debbie's, Joe, Tam, Sean and I got to go to dinner and then see the new Harry Potter movie.  :-D  It was a great night for all of us!  Sunday we went to the San Diego County Fair (I can't stop myself from calling it the Del Mar Fair though!).  We haven't gone in a few years, but this time it was required.  One of the perks of being an art teacher/volunteer, is that my child's art is automatically chosen for display at the Fair.  I also got to pick the best piece of art in the class for submission to the Fair.  After riding a few rides, and eating a few pounds of fried food, we went to the Kid's Best tent.  The Kid's Best tent is where all of the elementary school art is displayed.  EVERY child gets recognition of some kind, but we were pleased to see that Ian had been given a 1st place award!   He's struggled with art this year, and seeing that sticker on his piece made him so proud. He grinned from ear to ear, and he held his head high.   On a personal note, my other student also received a 1st place award.  :-)  That made me extra proud as well.  On Mondays, I go to Ian's class and assemble the homework folders.  I happened to be there when Ian was given his reading assessment test.  Afterwards, his teacher and I chatted for a bit.  She said that Ian's reading at the 2nd grade level! WOW!  She had to go and get a separate assessment test for him, because he's beyond what she used for the other kids.  She commented that not only is his reading advanced, but his comprehension is exceptional.  She said that many kids can read that well, but not many can really comprehend and apply what they've read.  I laughed, and told her that I couldn't take all the credit for Ian's reading... I think a lot of it is from the video game guides that he's had to read.  ;-)
Heading to Japan again for the week.  Anyone need anything?  (^_^)
Okay, so if you use web based email (e.g. hotmail or yahoo mail) then GMail is the new replacement.  The gut response is "This ROCKS!"    To be more objective, here is what I like about it.  Remember, this is a web based interface written in VERY simple languages.  It uses the same technology as y
