Damn, I am jazzed. I just got finished watching Anatomy of a Scene on  urlLink Sundance Channel  they were detailing Zach Braff's first directorial effort  urlLink  Garden State.   First off I think this film just looks amazing, the cinematography is touching yet comic (ala American Beauty) and the art direction is slightly stylized and surreal.  Wait.  Did that last sentence make sense to anyone who is not a film geek?  Anyway...  I'm supposed to be shooting the opening scene of my movie this weekend, however I'm not sure that it will happen because not all of my props have arrived yet. At this point I can either drive to Atlanta tomorrow (about 5 hours each way) or wait 'til next weekend to shoot. GAH, thats no good either, I already have a project that I'm shooting for someone else next weekend. Now I have a conundrum. I'm thinking I might just make the drive so I can shoot on Sunday.   Well, that kind of took the wind out of my sails  Damn, I used to be jazzed.
Thats right, first post ON my birthday. This year I didn't make any New Years resolutions so I'm making some for my birthday. Here they are in no particular order, well, other than the fact that they are going to be on a numeric list:  1. Finish at least 3 films this year.  2. Write more. (hence this blog!)  3. Train to run in next years Music City Marathon.  4. Let the people in my life know that they matter.  5. Stop whining  It's a pretty short list but then again life is pretty good right now. I will try to update this at least once a day. Hopefully I'll get into a groove and feel more comfortable with it in the near future.
I got a call around 4 this afternoon to see if I could do some filming tonight. I of course said yes, then on the way home from the gig I realized that tonight was pretty much my last night to see my family for the next week and a half or so. I'm already booked every night until the first of July either shooting footage for demo reels for clients working in some capacity on my own movie.   I am so happy. It's insane really I have never really enjoyed work, but now I LOVE it! After years of dreaming of  directing projects I'm finally getting to do it as my occupation. It's been over a year since I've had a "real" job, I've either done photography or film projects since then. I feel so lucky, even though I know it's not luck. It's just having the balls to do what you want to do. Not to boast or anything, but I am proud of the fact that I haven't given in and gotten a regular job (even though I've been tempted to several times, because, in a way it'd be easier to give up my dreams and just work in a factory)   Thank you to everybody who has supported m
