This is typed from another 10-minute break. We still have 2 more rounds to go... Man, I'm getting tired. Some of the original players had went to play xBox instead. So, the 2 of them are replaced by another 2 cousins from far far away. They are sort of having holiday back in California, so they just flew here, since they hadn't done so for nearly 10 years. The first thing I found weird about them is that, while the local people are finding it sort of a freezing night, they insist that we should on the air-con. Brr, we are sure in a freezer now, and they still complaint that it's warm! (it's 24 C)   What is most surprising is, they have fluent Chinese and many Chinese cultures!!! What a shame to Singaporeans! They are living in an "ang moh" country, and their Chinese can still be so good! Sigh, better whip out my Chinese now, it's sort of getting low-standard...
I'm playing mahjong now with my cousins. We are taking a 10-minnute break now, giving me time to update this blog. I've have won most of the rounds!!! Although we didn't really gamble real money today, I'm still very happy. Anyway, we are going to play 12 rounds since we started at 6pm. We have just finished our 7th round, so a few more to go. Mahjong is one of my favourite games, since I always win.  It has stopped raining today, what a disappoinment!!! It's starting to get real hot. Haix... I had hoped that this rain will go on. Okay, this break is nearly over, better get going. Got to finish 5 rounds by 12 midnight.  Oh! I nearly forgot to talk about PE today. The PE teachers wanted us to run 3km, 80 push-ups and 40 sit-ups! It's killing us!!!!!!!!!!!!
Okay, this is my first blog and supposedly my first diary, unless you want to count the dream diary my teacher told me to keep. She said it can be good for literature purpose, and she got the idea from the Harry Potter book (supposed to be a divination class).   Anyway, it's dear old ks who told me to blog. He actually BEGGED me (no offence meant). I don't understand how he can be that desparate to read some other people's life! (Maybe he want to see how i die in school everyday.) As usual, lessons are boring today, especially maths (the prime, rational, complex, numbers are driving me nuts). And again, there is a lot of homework. Some pupils told the teacher that they are Muslims and celebrating Hari Raya and the teacher actually believed it! (Mind you, mine's a Chinese school!)  Also, nothing special actually happened today, unless you want to count a classmate being late for lessons and the teacher locked him outside the classroom. Another thing which is worrying me, the chosing of EP3s! I'm still pondering over what to do.   Today, we discussed about the IP programme too. I gave in my opinion that parents are given more competition as they are u
