So far:  Self proclaimed smartest man in the world. Jarvis Cocker. Samuel L. Jackson.
Well I'm at Dom's house (NTHELL have screwed my box up).  I'm watching Big Brother and the rundown on the new housemates is, well, a bunch of nutters:  There's a lesbian, a sex-changer, a guy in a thong, someone pretending to look like Samuel L Jackson in the Barclay's advert, a posh girl amongst others.  Channel 4 have gone full stops to make these guys hate each other, they have limited beds (two members have to share a double), one of them will not be having their suitcase .  It's certainly more interesting than last year.  Though I loath most reality TV, BB does have an attraction this, simply because there's a chance they'll try and take each other out with blunt objects.  See you all later.

She is dippy but seems ok. Mind you, I have been wrong before.
They have picked a bunch of people who will clearly drive each other nuts in a very short space of time. They seem to be ignoring each other but shouting at the moment. Looking hopeful. First tension, noone seems to want to share Jason's bed.
This review of Real LifeTM (one of the oldest and  persistent multiplayer role-playing games) was originally posted on GameSpot a  year or so back.&nbsp; I just found it while clearly out some old text files on  my Palm.&nbsp; It sounds a really good game, I think it's still going, so maybe  a few of us should give it a try?      &nbsp;    ---      &nbsp;    Volumes have already been written about real life,  the most accessible and most widely accepted massively multiplayer online  role-playing game to date. Featuring believable characters, plenty of lasting  appeal, and a lot of challenge and variety, real life is absolutely  recommendable to those who've grown weary of all the cookie-cutter games that  have tried to emulate its popularity--or to just about anyone, really.   &nbsp; Real life is densely populated and features a wide variety of  places to explore and activities to engage in.     &nbsp;    Real life isn't above reproach. In one of the  stranger design decisions in the game, for some reason you have no choice in  determining your character's initial starting location, appearance, or gender,  which are chosen for you seemingly at random. However, over the course of your  character's life, you have tremendous opportunity to customize and define a  truly unique appearance for yourself--not only can you fine-tune your hairstyle  and hair color, but you can also purchase and wear a seemingly infinite variety  of clothing and influence your body type using various in-game mechanisms. For  example, if your character exercises frequently, you will appear fit and  muscular. You may also choose from a huge variety of tattoos and body piercings,  and later you can even pay for cosmetic surgery, though this is expensive and  there's a small chance that the operation will backfire. At any rate, real life  offers a truly remarkable amount of variety in determining your character's  outward appearance, a
