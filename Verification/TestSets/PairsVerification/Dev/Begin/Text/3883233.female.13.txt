Well &nbsp;Angie is over and my mom comes in and says there wont be a rec soccer team. Now you are like big deal a rec soccer team what is "rec" ne ways. rec is where oyu dont have to try out for a team any one who wants to be on one is on one.&nbsp;but if there arent enough players then there is NO team. adn if there is no rec team then i dont get to play soccer this season. for the simple reason of windy being a bitch. i seriously love soccer its like one of my every things. its always been there for me and now its not. ive played since i was 4 w. ashley. people always ask you what sport you play well i always answer soccer and track (but i didnt start track until 7th grade) now what do i say..? my mom wants me to do cross country but i cant even run a mile, ok i can run it but its not fun and i would rather not run like 5 miles at 5 in the morning. but seriously i thought i was gonna just cry when she was like there isint gonna be a soccer team&nbsp;b.c i serioously cant find any thing that im good at that goes year round. track is just like 4 track meets at the end of the school year. but w.e screw it.
So today angie comes over, ive told you about her, and so she has this guy pal she met on the internet named jared, and so of course i talk to him.&nbsp; well eventually we call him and talk to him. i just ask him&nbsp;a bunch of stupid questions so i could auctually carry on a conversation w. him. but of ocurse he thinks im "a lil weird' him and his lil albama accent, w.e he thinks im a freak, and you know something i bet alotta people think that, especially their first impressions of me. but w.e screq him. so also tosay as i was on the phone w. buster makin a date for tommrrow we just start talking about what ever and i decide to tell him every thing about me that no one else knows. its not bad stuff but just minor details that i dont tell people, like my left boob&nbsp;is bigger than my right, i even have some hairs on my nipples, i dont think i have a G spot (and if i do i cant find it) i some times sleep w. no underwear on, i love walking around naked (except for my small chest size), that i reall ydo use crest white strips.&nbsp;just stuff like that. but ne ways i think i should be more real, more myself.
so for the last two weeks i have been at a camp, FUN FUN!! and i come back and i have this V-ball camp to go to. well i suck a volley ball so i wasnt having fun with all the preps seeing how much i stink so i c
