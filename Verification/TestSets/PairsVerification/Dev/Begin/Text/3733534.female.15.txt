Today my friends and I painted our sunday school room.  It was loads of fun.  Although at first it was a little rough at the start because I was not on the greatest terms with one of them, I got along with them at the end and we had a great time.  If I haven't learned anything at all today, at least I learned these two things.  Number one, I cannot do trim, I always mess up (lol, just kidding).  The second and more serious one is, just because you don't get along with someone or aren't on their best side.  There are always things to do to make it better.  I am not going to say that it will always be like that, but when you take the time and set your differences, or fights aside it makes the day much more enjoyable.  I don't know if it will go on.  Right now it is lasting, but we had a lot of tension at the beginning of the day and at the end we were laughing with everybody else and we all had a REALLY great time.  I don't know aobut you, but I was sort of surprised that the day worked out so well.  The room looks great and all of our spirits are soaring.  We are ready to fly through the clouds which, by the way, is what our room looks like, clouds!!  Well all, I am going to go for now, I am caked in paint because people thought it funny to put hand prints all over me.  Peace, Much Love, Live long and prosper, and all that other stuff.  P.S. Just cause you don't get along, doesn't mean your day has to be ruined.  ;-)
Some of us need to stop and just look at our surroundings.  We need to notice the details in the little things, or else we might overlook something and be angry by what we THOUGHT we saw.  For example.  I came home and my brother had taken my room again and so, I got irritated with him, yes, but I went to sleep in his room nevertheless.  I woke up this morning ready to go downstairs and say goodmorning.  Well, nobody knew I had been home for the whole night.  I could have died and nobody would have known.  They thought that my brother, was sound asleep in his own bed.  They never took the time to look at the face with her eyes closed.  They just assumed.  Then when my brother came from the basement, nobody thought to think, 'OH he slept in the basement that much be Sunny in his room.'  No, I went unnoticed.  Mom and Dad were angry at me when I walked into the room to say goodmorning.  There questions were, "where did you come from?  Where have you been?"  I felt stupid when I had to tell them.  I was in Artie's room sleeping because he took mine.  You know, if people would take time to notice the simple things in life like the fact t
