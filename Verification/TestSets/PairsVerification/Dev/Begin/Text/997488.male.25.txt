i'm not feeling introspective today, so i will write nothing.
baltimore is rainy today, but not too cold. the leaves have all turned red, so it's really beautiful, especially on my street. i love rain. if i took a photograph of my street right now, it'd be almost like a postcard, with old colorful houses, cobblestone road, shiny drenched ground, and red and yellow leaves everywhere. and no one would probably guess it's baltimore (except for the rowhouses, which would be a dead giveaway), the crime/homocide/drug/poverty capital of america. it's like paul simon's kodachrome song, "makes you think all the world's a sunny day." poor balto; it can actually be quite lovely. amazing what we've done to this city, and much of the world. mankind's impact on the earth and itself boggles the mind. we've just finished the week-long human behavior course. one of the lectures was on drug abuse and addiction, in which we had to read an excerpt from "the corner," a rather famous piece about drug in baltimore. after that lecture i went home and watched traffic (courtesy of jon lee...still). it absolutely appalls me the magnitude of the drug problem and the depth to which it is injuring and murdering our people and society. yet isn't it all done to us by ourselves? from the movie, which was heralded as a not-so-unrealistic portrait, it paints an overwhelming picture of the drug problem in america. it was almost disheartening and discouraging. but there're lots that can and needs to be done. check this out: www.drugfreeamerica.com  on a lighter note, here're some great new from the world of formula one racing. jaguar team has secured two new drivers, although the rationale for bumping eddie irvine off the team is bizzare, borderlining stupid. (hopefully there are some good reasons behind it, 'cuz irvine has done respectably well for jaguar.) the r4 (next year's car) will be unveiled on january 13, 2003. best of luck to one of my favorite team. and jordan is jumping on the ford wagon, becoming another ford cosworth-powered team. yeah! i've always liked the jordan team. and team arrows will be amongst the entry next year, as it has been taken over the a german company. it's a bit of a disappointment, though, 'cuz i thought it was going to be taken over by the americans, reportedly dan gurney. arrows has always had real nice-looking cars. as for cart, it's quite a pity that so many famous teams ditched it for irl next year. in my opinion, cart is much more exciting than irl, what with its international stint, road and street courses, and big-time players that occassionaly jump over to formula and become stars. seems to me irl is somewhat of a nascar with open-wheeled racing machines; oval tracks are just not that exciting.
