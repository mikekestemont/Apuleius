Some of the news isn't appalling. It's simply about how appalling the news is. I'm including a must-read editorial by Paul Krugman from the NYT. If you don't religiously read Krugman (twice a week, every week) then register for the online times and just do it. Bob Herbert is also good. Kristof and Dowd are excellent; Kristof tends to raise issues about how we fail to notice tiny things like genocide in Sudan, and Maureen Dowd writes great essays, but ends them terribly. I'm not sure why this bothers me so much, but it does. I always feel like I've missed a page when I get to the end of one of hers.   Amy Goodman in a Democracy Now! interview gets a similar meta-news thing going with Ted Koppel.&nbsp;Lots of good news about news articles on the democracy now home page...&nbsp;&nbsp;     urlLink  Triumph of the Trivial     By PAUL KRUGMAN  Published: July 30, 2004  Under the headline "Voters Want Specifics From Kerry," The Washington Post recently quoted a voter demanding that John Kerry and John Edwards talk about "what they plan on doing about health care for middle-income or lower-income people.

Why hasn't this voter heard about it?     urlLink  ABC's Ted Koppel Refuses To Apologize For Pre-War Iraq Coverage     Koppel tells Democracy Now!, "I don't think an apology is due.

Honestly.   I had the idea for this blog because I used to print out all the horrifying news stories every day and file them away so I could, sort of like Mel Gibson in Conspiracy Theory, track the decline of our country page by page. I could find dozens every day that were subtle but connectable, (but, c'mon, earthquakes in Turkey? Puhleeze.)   I'm having problems this week. The news is all about the convention, which is as spontaneous and newsworthy as the farm report. Hey, I'm a democrat, and I'm not even buying into this love fest.   In any case, I've asked friends to send in some good candidates, and I got a few:    APPALLING NEWS      urlLink  CEO pay hikes double     NEW YORK (CNN/Money) - The CEO's at the nation's largest companies saw their raises more than doubled in 2003 as the median raise handed out by S&P 500 companies to their top executives was 22.18 percent, according to a study by The Corporate Library.     and yet...     urlLink  Americans' incomes fell for two years     NEW YORK (CNN/Money) - Americans' overall i
