I worked today.  It wasn't too bad.  In fact., it got rather interesting when someone spilled their large Coke (boo) into the popcorn heater.  Luckily, the popcorn soaked up most of the mess.

I didn't know too many people, and I felt .bad that I had no money with me, particularily because they passed around a basket church-style.
