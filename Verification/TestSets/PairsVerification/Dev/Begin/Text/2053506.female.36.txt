I got my shipment of yarn today in the mail.  The extra stuff I'll need to finish my ruana.  I think I'll probably have leftovers, but I am always paranoid of not having enough to finish my projects.  I have only ever ordered from  urlLink Elann  and I always pleased with their speediness, packaging, and prices.  They always seem to have tons of sales.  I love just browsing - you should take a look, it's rather addicting.  Window shopping for yarn.
I took a boring old t-shirt and jazzed it up with some beading. This was my crafting project for the day:     And here is a close-up, but it's not very clear...     You get the idea though...
I was knitting on my ruana today, and I realized that I would need more yarn if I was going to make the whole thing according to the directions, so I logged on to  urlLink Elann  and kept my fingers crossed.  They had enough!  I'm using  urlLink this  in the ebony, stone, and espresso n chocolate.  It's gonna look great.  It's mostly in the ebony.  I wear so much black, it's not funny.  I am thankful they had enough left.  The price was good too.  This yarn is very forgiving, which is good, cause I'm still not an expert knitter or anything, and I drop stitches here and there and never realize it till it's way late.  Thank goodness for bulky yarns.
Awhile ago I bought yarn for  urlLink this  pattern.  Well, I found out I bought yarn that was MUCH too thin.  So today I began knitting the three scarf ruana from  urlLink this  book.  I am so happy to be knitting and doing something creative. It's moving along nicely.    Today I also purchased urlLink this  book at the bookstore.  I am still not confident enough to do complicated stuff, so I'm ok with easy for a while.
Here are pix of my three completed projects:  Scarf    Purse    Bag    The pattern for the bag is as follows: Color A - Gray Color B - Medium Blue Color C - Light Blue Color D - Navy  For the front and back knit two of the following CO 80 (WS) K15 rows of A K3 of B K6 of C K2 of D K5 of A K9 of B K2 of D K6 of A K5 of C K2 of D K9 of B K7 of C K7of A CO  For the two side panels knit the above pattern only 15 wide For the bottom panel knit all in Color A 15 wide for 160 rows For the handle knit all in Color A 15 wide for 205 rows  Weave pieces together.

I need to journal what I've done else I forget  I made a scarf from my knitting book.  Book I:  The Knit Stitch.  It's the horizontal scarf.  I used homespun yarn from Walmart.  Like three different types.  It was a good first project - the yarn is WAY forgiving.  I followed the directions exactly.  Project 2 - I u
