It's now 22:54 (10:54pm for you weird folk) and I can't remember any of the nice things about my day. I've been to work again and It was exactly like yesterday except I have 3 papercuts on my right hand, three cut's on my right wrist and one on my left forearm. They didn't really bother me till I ate some salt and vinegar crisps and realised I had them. Working for UPS isn't bad till the last hour of the shift where I start to ache, some of the stuff we have to move Is pretty nifty like:  Mobile phones: There lite and easy to move and you might have thought they were for communication but your wrong. Screw your txt's and phone calls you haven't used a phone properly till you've thrown It at someone's head or had one thrown at yours.  Widescreen TV's: Everyone seems to want one but they don't realise that they endanger my existence everything I move one. Theres only one me and I'm not registered for the species protection thing. Go buy a portable there smaller, easier to move and you can do the rockstar thing with ease.  Hewlett Packard stuff: Lotsa printers, scanners, etc easy to move and stuff.   Bus'  I finished work at 20:30 (8:30pm) I got to the bus station at 20:40 (work It out lazy) my bus was due for 21:11 (It's not hard) stupid bus didn't show till 22:00 (see). Bus' have a habit of being late but 49mins late Is slighty ridiculous and since my bus was late I got home to find everyone's had gone to bed so I can't have a bath or shower. I smell, I'm a dirty colour and I have cuts to clean. Oh and my pants are torn.   [now playing - X-Ray Spex - I Am A Cliché]
I lied it's not that interesting.  Today I got up showered, went on IRC said hi and stuff with lots of !!! And  So today I've spoken to Jayce, Koma and Moges. I didn't really have any idea of what they might sound like mainly because I... I can't remeber how this sentence was supposed to end. But anyway they all sound nice and stuff and Koma doesn't really sound 8 more 10 or 11 (haha I'm mocking you but you have better english skills and stuff so I'll shut up). Jayce sounded like she's from the other side of the world and she doesn't say bro at all. (I  Moges didn't say much he was watching tennis.. well he wasn't watching the tennis but he was looking at the screen.  I'm still waiting to talk to Moonman and some other people.  That was the interesting or not part of my day.  After all the fun I had to go to work and play tetris with stuff for 3½ hours from 5 while 8:30pm. By 7:45 I was drained of all energy apart from my face and my face didn't really feel up to moving boxes either. Anyway I dragged and scraped myself to t
