There are places I remember  In my life  though some have changed, Some forever not for better, Some have gone and some remain.  All these places had their moments, With lovers and friends I still can recall, Some are dead and some are living, In my life I've loved them all.  But of all these friends and lovers, There is no one compares with you, And these memories lose their meaning, When I think of love as something new.  Though I know I'll never lose affection For people and things that went before, I know I'll often stop and think about them, In my life I love you more.  Though I know I'll never lose affection For people and things that went before, I know I'll often stop and think about them, In my life I love you more.  In my life I love you more.

Okay my dream was going great, i was at a carnival with my friends and i was having snow cones and then..my subconcious fear came into play. It just totally ruined the dream, waking me up and making me want to vomit. It really was all the thoughts that I've been having played out in one swift movement in my dreams. Geez, do I hate that. I can't even escape it in my dreams. I bet a lot of people are wondering what "it" is. I'm gonna leave it at "it" for now. Not even the people who know me best know what exactly it is I bet.  So yesterday, I got up to go driving on the sunny day and I got to about down the street when there was almost an accident like 30 feet from me. I heard someone screaming the eff word litterally 20 times at the driver that messed up. Needless to say, I didn't want to go driving anymore. I chilled at home and did nothing until I said "Hey, I wonder what Cat is up to.." So I called her up and we talked a bit on the phone until it started to cut out and she to come up to starbucks (where she was) so I did. We talked and got caught up. I love those talks where she and I just let it all out and we usually agree with whatever each other is saying so that makes it even better. It's so nice to have these thoughts that no one else has and then go to Cat and she's thinking the exact same thing too! And we heard someone was playing tipsy and it made us think of Sanela-nela. Boy, do I miss her. So, more people showed up and we finally left. And everyone, I am a witness to this..Catherine was jamming to Jurassic 5 in her car!! HAHA! It was hilarious. The night was y
