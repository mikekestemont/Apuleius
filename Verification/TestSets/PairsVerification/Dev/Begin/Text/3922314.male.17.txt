Upon my kingdom of love in the days of old , There was a ever so lovely princess whose hair did shine like gold , With a face pure as the color virgin snow , The purest of heart and ever so radiating beauty that glows ,  She strolled outside the palace of my heart , onto the lush gardens of my kingdom , Picking the sweet buds of roses that grew from my love , in her hands only to bloom , I felt the faint breeze that blew my hair askew as nightfall grasps firmly onto the skyline , Alone I watched the sun as it slowly faded away , The moonlight accentuated the majestic tides , Only in a humble attempt to lift my spirits before the lonesome beginning of another day , All the passion I immediately felt towards her overpowers all the hauntingly hopeless dreams , Ravaging my mind into a disheartening demise,Vividly foreshadowing my visions of our eternity , Beside the shore we talked throughout the night , I couldn’t help but gaze intrepidly into her eyes , Finally I gathered up enough courage to declare unconditionally I do surrender to her beauty , Falling captive to the love that set me free , She was my enchanting princess of the dawn… Beth..
Can u remember the electricity we felt when our hands first touched , The newness and excitement ,the heat , like a flame on a torch , Remember when I first kissed you , as our lips gently touched , Tasting each other first softly , then firmly and then openly aroused , We watched our inhibitions float far away , turning unthinkable thoughts into heavenly deeds , As our pains of the past collapsed in the wind of a quivering breath , all set free , We faded from mortal souls , and slipped into a torrent of passion and desire , Lets not fool ourselves , let us allow this desire to burn upon the candle lit in our hearts forever , Lets be in love forever and not for one night , So we don’t have to watch it all fade away when morning arrives , Lets live a whole lifetime together in moonlit hours and never look back , Even though we have our own lives to lead and our own trails to blaze , Let us not allow our flame of passion , love and desire to smolder and die under the weight of the coming morning dew , We can spend the rest of our nights to come together , And reminisce on how we first caressed away in our deepest desires ….  Baby B i love you..
Never is there such a word which could define beauty in its purest form , Nor , such strong emotions felt for one in any way , Your eyes , deep and dark , full of charm and ever so heavenly , Bright like the stars they gaze on me with longing and fear continuously , They lure me i
