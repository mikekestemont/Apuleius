Because I finally got a chance to wear my adorable new grass green slicker from  urlLink  Urbn.com  .   Good Good Weekend - all the important things were covered - a little bit of politics, a whole lotta dancing and libations, and some mad manicure and pedicure action.   Watched a show on the Travel Channel about new things to do in Vegas so we are now making plans to go to  urlLink  Ice  , the hottest and coldest bar on the Strip. I know, I know, at this point you're wondering - How can a club be both hot AND cold?  Well, my friends, I'm going to be honest - I don't really get it either.  But it has something to do with liquid nitrogen and a temperature drop of about 30 degrees.  Just don't tell my parents where we're going as I'm sure they'd be concerned that the sudden change in temperature will cause us all to catch cold.   My mom has already begun bombarding me with her now infamous "Don't set your drink down" (DSYDD) speech. Since I was a pretty thoughtful teenager I think I may have actually listened to her had she not prefaced "DSYDD" speech numero uno with "Last week on 'Walker Texas Ranger', there was this girl at a club with a drink..."  Sorry mom, but any kind of behavioral lessons usually go unheeded once you bring Chuck Norris into the fold.   I had a whole slew of links I wanted to direct people to but for some reason "Walker Texas Ranger" has distracted my very fragile attention span. Ah wait, I think they're coming back.  Further proof that I am the original celeb trendsetter continues to develop.  First, on a recent shopping trip I referred to myself as "the Paris Hilton of Target."  Now, a new Target just opened in Brooklyn to a  urlLink  celeb-studded party   featuring a certain friend of mine's fave indie girl, Maggie Gyllenhaal.    Next, what is up with all the celebrity break-up chaos?  First it was me and a certain Yellow Rat Bastard and now it's  urlLink  Kirsten & Jake   and  urlLink  Paris & Nick  ...who will be next???  A couple of side items that make me giggle a wee bit.   First of all, I just have to say that even though the New York Post is not exactly a safehouse of accurate journalism, I still think they are a really fun read.   Maybe they are having so many problems this summer because the majority of their staff is in the Hamptons writing up the Hamptons Diary and this other column which could basically double for the barhopping adventures of any city, but since it's in the Hamptons is somehow supposed to matter.  Today's  urlLink  article   is about a dude who sold his shirt for a $100 to gain access to a crowded hot spot.   Finally,in honor of my weekend of double entendres and XXX-rated Mad Libs, click  urlLink here   to see a really classy headline from Reuters News Service about MTV network's new gay channel, Logo.
