Finding #1 I am really not a shopping girl. How often do you find a woman who despise shopping.  Fact #1 Never never never buy products that you are not familiar with. And never be too lazy to go look for what you want.  Finding #2 You are really a cow in the head. Really geram with your cow-ness at times.  Prediction #1 I am going to have diarrhea because I cooked today nyahahahaha.....  Memoir #1 Awww... I really miss my cheese macaroni days.
So, please don't go back to work. I seriously think I need to chill. Well, you have not go for a holiday for 4.5 years already, so at least take your Sunday off, woman.   This is the plan for the day:  Wake up. Clean yourself. Clean the room. Feed the pets. Go get some food. Go shopping. Get dinner. Come back. Chat. Clear your personal documents. Chat. Go to bed. Hmmm...  Can I tell you I am missing someone here. I really do. I don't know why. It's not like I have not seen him for a very long time.   I dreamt a lot of stuff last night.

But am too lazy to get dressed to get food. Aaahhh... nothing new.
Do you remember the days when you make little surprises just to get someone smiling? I thought I almost forget that already. But I guess that things just never change. You are what you are.  Forgot to kiss you good night.  Bei.  Spoke to Kin San to see whether we could get together next week. As usual he just sounded exhausted. Felt a bit sakit hati also. But there is so little that you can do.  I didn't really hear what my honey bunny said. I think he said something about go update my blog. But one thing I heard clearly was thank you. * (:| *  Something just doesn't feel right tonight. You know that feeling, you sit not right, you stand not right, you lie down also not right... I don't really know what i
