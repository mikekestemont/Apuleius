apparently he did read the letter after all.&nbsp; and contrary to my prediction, I did manage to get my point across, or at least  a  point across, and it left a mark.&nbsp; from what I understand, he's confused as to why I am angry, other than the fact that "maybe" he should've told me himself....&nbsp; confused?!?&nbsp; what is there to be confused about?&nbsp; didn't I explain myself quite thoroughly and extensively?&nbsp; it's all there in black and white.&nbsp; and yes, damn right he should've told me himself, which is why that&nbsp;point was included in the letter as well.         what I didn't expect out of all this is that the letter ended up in Chef's hands.&nbsp; it was not addressed to him, nor was it about him, and nor was it meant to specifically upset him.&nbsp; but for some reason I guess marc-andre felt the need to pass it along to him nonetheless.&nbsp; and apparently he is choosing to react as though it were directed&nbsp;at him, even though as I've stated, it was not.&nbsp; my understanding is that he's shocked to learn that after approving a letter of reference&nbsp;for me that he neither wrote nor signed, that he would indirectly receive an angry letter from me that was intended for someone else.&nbsp;&nbsp;(excuse me while I pace around my mind trying to figure out what the hell the connection is....)&nbsp; so, even though what I wrote had merit and credibility, apparently I'm not allowed to voice my opinion, and he feels that the proper course of action for him to take is to put a stop to my getting the job in florida.&nbsp; does anyone believe that this is supposedly a fully-grown man we're talking about here?         what they initially did to me obviously made me justifiably upset, so I wrote a letter in which I clearly stated how I felt.&nbsp; I was succinct and concise, and I tried my best not to let my anger get the better of me and lead to flying off the handle.&nbsp; and to me, the most important thing about that letter is the fact that it was the truth.&nbsp; and that I had every right to express it.&nbsp; though it may be unprecedented, I consider it to be a formal letter of complaint to a former employer.&nbsp; the way I see it, they run a business and they have to be prepared to deal with receiving complaints, whether it's from customers or from within.&nbsp; but apparently they're not.&nbsp; I don't know, at this point, whether or not he's gone through with sabotaging my plan to work at cafe boulud, but if he has or is still going to, what can I really say but that it's terrifically pathetic.     &nbsp;
kathleen gave me an assignment for this week - since trying to recall my 3 earliest childhood memories just wasn't working out for me, she decided we'd try a little dream analysis. this past sunday morning I awoke from a beautiful dream that I would give anything in the world to have come true. so here it i
