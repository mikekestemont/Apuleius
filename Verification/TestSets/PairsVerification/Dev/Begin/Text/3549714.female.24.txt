She woke up suddenly in the midst of the nite due to an unknown fear ...there was darkness all around. it was dark ,dark enough for her to hope for any ray of light...her eyes wide open, struggling hard to see but in vain...the darkness was deep, piercing into her soul making her feel like crying and calling out loud for help but it was in vain seemed like all the screams and cries somehow lost their jingle as she opened her mouth...her vocals failed ,but somehow tears made there way silently, moistening her face and adding to her vulnerability...the gloomy and mysterious winds gave her a sickening feeling ..she was soaked with perspiration...fear was gradually creeping into her soul making her feel entangled into a web of darkness , lightly but tightly woven around her...... The locks of darkness were as tightly woven as that of her life, where she was breathing and living with a feeling of being caught up helplessly and off guard, wanted to come out of it..get over it, but things got worst at even a slight move,it was as if the strands tightened around her, hurting her badly, making her cry ,but the depth of darkness was deep enough to absorb her vails and cries...beam of light was nowhere...darkness had taken over the glow and shine of hope and lightening from her life...she felt miserable........ but suddenly a realization struck.."Therz always light behind every dark nite"....and so definitely somehow , someday the shadows of the dark will be taken over by all the brightness and joy this life has to offer her...some day the strands with b let loose to give her the freedom to breath and radiate the smiles of happiness and contentment.This realization led her to the new dimensions of life ,now even in the blackness of mid nite she could c the far and distant sun rising above to eat up the shades of the dark sky ,announcing a better tomorrow and bringing a smile of satisfaction to her lips...she closed her eyes and just in an instant was lost into the valley of sweet dreams.
Just today only a realization struck me.........somehow I have lost track of life. Every second is passing by and i have just stopped worrying ab8 the preciousness of every instance that i am losing.The sand of time is just slipping out of my fingers giving me the insight of being a looser!!! I am, what i didnt expect out of life..what i didnt want to be..but now since i am what i am then i have to give the best to what i am and make sure to c how good can i be. I need more commitment towards life, more commitment towards what i do, more seriousness in my work, in thoughts……running away from life,from responsibilities, from realization  …is not like me!!! Once certain things need to be done they are to be done with all the best that I have to offer and I need to enjoy every bit of it….how can I just k
