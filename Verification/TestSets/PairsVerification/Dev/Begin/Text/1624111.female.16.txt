Im watching pleasantville. (with subtitles so i dont miss a quote) good movie. possibly my favorite movie. which would mean it beats monty python which i guess used to be my favorite movie...its still funny and all, but it doesnt have much meaning. gotta love pleasantville for meaning. its got all the things i love in a movie...an excellent score, nice cinematography, a good script (very important), decent actors (i liked toby before he was in spiderman...and reese is okay, she has some good lines...nice deliverly. and then theres whilliam h macy whos great...and oh, i think paul walker...who gets points for hotness...hate him in fast & the furious though. jeff daniels is pretty good. and the wife, dont know her name, joan allen? but shes a nice actress.) and meaning. so many movies lack meaning. its sad. all the teen movies lack meaning...but i see them anyway. sad, i know. so, anyway, im watching pleasantville and im writing one of these cause i do enjoy rambling, i enjoy it ever so much. so i decided since its such an awesome movie and it has a pretty good script id make a list of quotes i like...possibly explain them, explain why i like them, how they relate to me... all that. (all that. i keep saying that. crazy.) here goes:  okay, there are lots of good lines, but here are the absolute best ones and i am too tired to explain them, plus whoever looks at this is probably my friend and therefore not a moron, so just read the quotes:  Betty: "I told you george, im not going to that meeting." George: "Sure you are." Betty: "No, im not. Look at me george, look at my face, that meeting's not for me." George: "You'll put on some makeup." Betty: "I don't want to put on some makeup."  George: "It goes away. It'll go away." Betty: "I don't want it to go away."  George: "Now you listen to me. You're coming to this meeting. Youre going to put on some makeup. Youre going to be home at 6:00 every night and youre going to have dinner ready on this table." Betty: "No, I'm not sweetie."   George: "What happened? One minute everythings fine. The next... what went wrong?" Bud: "Nothing went wrong, people change." George: "People change?" Bud: "Yeah, people change." George: "Can they change back?" Bud: "I dont know. I think its harder ...You okay?" George: "It's, it's not fair you know, you get used to one thing--" Bud: "I know, it's not."   Bud: "You dont have a right to do this. I mean, I know you want it to stay pleasant around here but  there are so many things that are so much better. Like silly or sexy or dangerous or brief. And every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them."      David: "What's wrong?" David's Mom: "I dunno, everything's just so f***** up. I got halfway down there and thought, 'What am I doing? He's 9 y
