For those who haven't talked to me in awhile, I should let you know that I hired a personal trainer at Goodlife Fitness to help me get back onto my feet in terms of running (no pun intended... haha).  She's a sub-4 marathon runner and she's currently training for the New York Marathon this year which I think is absolutely awesome.  Couldn't have asked for a more appropriate (or better) trainer.    Today marks session 2 (out of 10) and we normally cover weight training over the half hour session since that's where I seem to have the most difficulty.  I find that I'm always pushing myself too hard or too little when it comes to weight training but my PT seems to have nailed the correct weights for me to use on the various exercises.  In fact, I'm already noticing subtle differences after 3 or 4 weight training sessions which is pretty cool.  Maybe it's in my head, but hey, either way, it's a great little ego boost for me. :D    Did some squats, bench press, leg curls, lat pull down, lower back, and ab exercises today... I think I'll do my last 2 runs on Saturday and Sunday just so that I don't push too hard.    I've got high hopes for the half marathon in September... I'm hitting my weekly goal of 4 runs a week and weight training twice a week.  All in all, I think I'll be able to give my buddy John a run for his money.  (no pun intended... haha)
Completed a 30 minute 5km run today at noon. Second outdoor run in the past month and the shin splints didn't hit me... Awesome!    Slight tightening of the muscles around the shin and knees while I was running but I think the biggest obstacle for me today was the heat. Lotsa sun, very little wind. Luckily I was wearing one of those cool technical t-shirts that wick away sweat otherwise it would've been unbearable!    Exhausting and rewarding. Looking forward to the weight training tommorow morning. Not looking forward to the evening outdoor run I have planned for myself.
Finally made it out for one of my short runs again (should've been yesterday but I was tired and lazy =P).  Ran alone during lunch hour, hot and sunny weather but a good strong breeze to cool off in while running.  8km/43 minutes on fairly flat terrain with a hill at about the 6 km mark.  All in all, a very good short run for me.  Very good morale booster... makes me want to run more. =)  Started the run with a fair amount of... trepidation?  The first 10 minutes were difficult, felt tired and stiff (even after stretching).  The next 20 minutes were fairly easy and relaxed once I got into a good rhythm.  Last 12 minutes were without breeze and so I had to work for the final leg of my run. :)  Finish felt awesome!  A fairly sharp pain in right shin at the halfway mark that passed in a few minutes (about 6 out of 1
