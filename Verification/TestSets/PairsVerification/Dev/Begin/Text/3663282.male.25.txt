Saw "Chronicles of Riddick" on Sunday with my best buddy. The movie was a disappointment to me, actually. I mean, it was darn full of action packed stunts, cool looking spaceships, weird animals, and other stuff worthy of making it one of my favourite movies of all time. But...  It's not! The story line was lame. Seriously. It reminded me of "Scorpion King". If "Chronicles of Riddick" was shown first, then maybe it could have made it into my 'favourite movies of all time' list. But it didn't. Sorry Vin Diesel. Among the movies in my list are "Braveheart", a Mel Gibson movie; "The Professional", a Luc Besson movie; "Pulp Fiction", "From Dusk Till Dawn", "Reservoir Dogs", all three directed by Quentin Tarantino.   While in KLCC, read Whoopi Goldberg's book entitled "Book". I'm serious, it's called "Book". Anyway, it's quite funny, actually. And I spent a few minutes reading through some chapters. In "Book", you'll find out why she's called 'Whoopi'. I'm not sure whether it's true, but it's funny, nonetheless. And although I've only read a couple of chapters of "Book", I think I like Tim Allen's "Don't Stand Too Close To A Naked Man" better. Another book I like is Michael Caine's autobiography called "What's It All About?" (the title referring to his first monster smash, Alfie). He wrote the book himself, and he's darn witty.   Bumped into some old friends in KLCC. Well, can't really say friends, since I don't know them that well. They were in the same college as I was back in uni. They were my seniors. Do you realise that whenever you bump into people who used to go to the same school or the same university (although you barely knew them), they will act as if you've known them well during the period of time when they were in your live? I do. And I think it's to do with a familiar face. I mean, a person looks at you and say, "Wait a minute, I know you from [insert university name here], don't I?". Then the person will update you on people you barely knew as well. I find this flattering, actually. Since they obviously still remember me, although I've grown a beard and gained a good couple of pounds. Hehehehe...
Came to work last night. Arrived at the office around 9.40pm. Then waited for the vendors to arrive. We started work at 10.40pm. Had to wait for the main person for last night's exercise. (Note: Exercise here means the activity that needed to be done last night; and not those exercise where you have to get into darn tight leotards, although if I wanted to, I could have gone to the office wearing leotards.. but then again, the guards might actually arrest me... heheheh....) Anyway, the exercise last night was to complete the shadow image we created that evening. It took a couple of minutes, all in all, it took us roughly 40-50 minutes, this plus the discussion, the scribbling down notes, and the 'what was that again' from us who w
