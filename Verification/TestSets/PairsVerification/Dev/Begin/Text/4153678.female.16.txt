For one thing i'm really glad that everything is finally over today. Had a long day today. Well though i studied much more and spent much longer time on Chem than Maths, Chem test done more badly than Maths. Ironic huh? Couldnt believe it myself too. Well there was a structural question on Alkenes and i didnt study that entire chapter. So i most probably lost lots of marks there. *sigh* Why muz they set questions on chapters i didnt finish studying? I finished all the chapters for Chem except that. And as a result i neglected my Maths. Thot i'll let down Mr Seow more than Miss Koh. Now i think it's the reverse.   After the CT i had IPW. GUess i have quite a lot cuz i was absent for MOnday's pw session and the group had finished almost most of the written report. Yupx. So this week is my turn to do my part of the written report. After that had tuition, then met up with Sing Yi at Starbucks @ Plaza Singapura.  Went to Yamaha to find music books later then went to Burger King to study. After that cuz Sing wanna watch the[ 倚天屠龙记] so we left @ 6.30pm. Hmn.. well thru out the entire outing with her today we really catched up quite a lot on each other. HAhaz.. even discussed bout our future and our family's finance problems...   All i could say is that i really enjoyed the outing with Sing Yi. Hahaz... That is what happens when true close friends confide in one another.  Guess we're a pair of confidants, yeah Sing Yi?? ^_^   Then me went home and till now lolz... hahaz.... gonna study today too.. do some homework, at least complete something today. Yup.   Oh Yesterday i managed to find the entire full song for  「爱上张无忌」 !!! Was so nice!!! It's prob the nicest song i've ever heard. Love the orchestra and 毛阿敏's vocal. SO powerful and shiok!!   Hahaz..me was even playing and replaying this song while studying yesterday. Simple just love this song...   OkaEz then,... gtg le. Have to start doing work cuz not early already. See Ya then. Nitez...
My 革命 journey is definitely yoyo and wavy. Last Wednesday i reached 64 Kg, i lost 0.5 kg from the previous week. But now, in just two days, i'm @ 66Kg!! ALL TIME HIGHEST!! OH GOSH!!!!!!!   I think probably it's because i've been 暴饮暴食 due to all the stress. It's definitely not good for health and i can feel all the food a strain to my heart. I've to cut down tomolo.   I'm supposed to lose to 62kg end of this week. But for now, after tomorrow's fateful day, i'll just try to cut down to my original weight. And from tml onwards i MUST learn to control my diet and studies. Firstly i dont want to die early cuz of my obese side and of course i wanna go well for my studies. Promos coming in less than 42 days. Have to start preparing now..   Right now, i'll just h
