Lindsey, We're 14, not thirteen. We're actually more mature then most girls our age. We're NOT drama Queens. YOU did say something and the qoute, 'Hello?! She's ruining one of my bestfriend's life and you expect me to stand here and do nothing?!' Yea, who ever said this, Yea, YOU said this, and Yea, *I* nor Leigh-Anne made it up. Yea, I'm the other girl on the phone, I'm sorry, but are we a level to be stooped upon just because of our age and grade level? That's pretty shallow. Leigh Anne's not mad at Rosie, nor at anyone, but i'm angry because of this, I did NOTHING. I was protecting my friend. I have dislike for you already Lindsey, but im not about to go off being a bitch about it all because I can't do that in here. Anywho I'm out of here.  Lily The Psycho Powered Goddess
Joah. god I hate you.
Just for the record... Rosie nor I said anything to Leigh Anne or whoever was on the phone.  We just said hello and they kinda took it from there because they asked where you were and I said you were in the bathroom.  I don't know where they got everything else.  All thirteen year olds are drama queens cuz they want their lives to be interesting and its not.  Sorry if she cried; she brought it upon herself.  And you don't help it much by tolerating her controling you're life.  But I'll stay out of it.  No more advice, etc.  Bye, Josh.  See You Monday.  If you want to get mad, fine.  If you want to sink to their level, that's cool.  Just don't bring it out on the DI team.  Oh, and we're about as happy with you as you are with us.
*laughs Insanely* JOSH!! YOU HAD BETTER PICK UP THE PHONEEE! Anywho, hahahahaha Anywho, Sit, im getting addicted to Leigh-Anne's words. BYE JOSHIESSS!!! BYE BYE BYE BYE BYE! * screams* BYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!1  Lily the Psycho Bitch
Ok, some ground rules...  Any of my invited people who check the team roster will see some people that they probably have conflict with...so no conflict or I kick you. I might just kick all of you anyway, nothing personal, I was sort of planning for this to be just mine, I put all of you on in a mini-fit.   And now to the problem.  People are fucking retarded. SURPRISE! Look at the name of my BLog for God's sake.  I don't want to understand anything anymore, I'm getting sick of that shit. Understand  me ! Understand why the fuck I get pissed off so fucking quick. Of course nobody will, I'm supposed to understand first. And that shit doesn't make sense. That is so gay.  Everything is so gay.  I swear to God, she is pissing me off. AGGGGGGHHH. I wish she wasn't, too.
