Below is a copy of a recent writing by my father regarding the death of our dog Harley.  She was proof of God's sense of humor in creation as well as in our lives.   I had to put my favorite dog, a Bassett/Lab mix, to sleep today. She was rescued from the dog pound 9 years ago and had lived a full and joyful life in our household.  Everyone who walked through our door was her new best friend.  As I sat and held her while she was being injected with a lethal overdose and watched  God "take away her breath, and she died and returned to the dust" (Psalm 104/Great Vespers) Then I took her home an buried her.  I watched the effect of sin take hold of a beloved creation of God.  I paid to have her destroyed to shorten and alleviate her suffering.  At my hands she died.  At my will, she perished. Because of my sin and the sin of my progenitor Adam, all this was "necessary".  I reflected on the fallen world and what I have killed in my 52 years on this earth.  Animals, yes, more importantly, relationships, hearts and souls of people, hopes, dreams, apsirations,.... love.  I have killed them all in one or another.  And I had more compassion for my dog than for some human beings.    Sin and death became real.  The eternal connection and the cosmic consequence lay before me, wheezing on the cold tile floor of the vet's office.  The ruthless reality of falleness was shoved through a syringe into what was a living thing, a joyous beast, a thing of wonder and pleasure to all who met her.  She died not knowing why it was her inevitable destiny.  She died not knowing it was I who ordered it both with a checkbook paid at the receptionist and by my sin and participation in Adam who brought this damned order into the creation.    What did I realize by this death? What will save us from death?  What heals this loss?  What will bring life?  No amount of punishment will bring life.  No amount of retribution will restore love.  Repentance heals the broken heart. Repentance restores what was killed by sin. Forgiveness re-unites and breathes life into the carcass of the wounded and broken relationships willfully killed by sin.    "A broken and contrite heart God will not depise"....  Will He accept my heart broken by bringing death to my beloved dog?  Will He accept my contrition for all my sins that I have realized while sitting watching my dog gasp her last dying breath?  The world is fallen.  I, by my sin, drag it down even further each moment.  Death is in my hands.  Life is in His hands.  I turn to Him, the one who gave life and I repent in sackcloth and ashes for my hardness of heart, for the death I have wrought.  I pray that in That Day, when "all things in the heavens and on the earth are summed up in Christ" that the love s
