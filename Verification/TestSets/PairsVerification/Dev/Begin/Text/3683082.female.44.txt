Hi all,  had to reqroup after the weekend of Drama I had,  OMG you will not believe this but here goes anyways.  Plans for the lake.....go out friday evening and set up camp.....take out the jetski, tube, food, and lets not forget the smores..........fun in the sun!!woohoo this ol gal ain't got to work the weekends no more......happy dance for me... Brittany and Chrissy (bio kids...hehehe) packed up as i did have to work till 6pm..they also did the shopping for food and other needed items....did a great job with toiletries, pillows, towels, clothes, ect....momma trained them well.....Come home friday evening all excited only to met at the door with drama from foster child  (we will call baby) as she is the youngest and for the most part acts like a baby....she don't want to go.....well hmmmmmmmmmmm  new boyfriend in the picture...hubby has to work saturday and other foster daughter has to work as well.....nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnoooooooooo not a good idea......I state  "you are going, end of story"  piss mode starts.  Little verbal attacks towards everyone.  The last one at me....something in the nature of "Everyone has sticks shoved up their asses" i believe is the comment she made to me while standing in my bedroom.  now i am not one to deal with disrespect too well...at first i asked her to leave my room....when i got the, Who Me? look i realized a lil physical persuasion was in order, swung her around and lifted her up two stairs by the seat of her pants....and a very firm OUT OF MY ROOM NOW!!  she has a brian and at that point decided to use it......up the stairs and backed off for a bit..... now before leaving my big ol love bug dog snuggles up to her for attention (he was a rescue dog from humane society, chessapeekbay retriever who was beat for a yr and 1/2 by previous owner) she lashes out and hits him on the head several times.....needless to say....momma is not happy. She did live through the evening...we got to lake...she assisted with setting up camp and all seemed calm. SATURDAY F**k why did i even get out of bed?  that was a question i kept asking myself.....but i did so now i deal with it....my oldest daughter came out and was very excited about spending the weekend with her and also with the other girls....breakfast came....baby ate, took meds., back in tent to lay down....ok....lunch came, baby up, ate lunch, complained of a headache.....back to tent to lay down...ok now this is where it begins......she realizes we are not putting jetski in water as day was too cool..we all decided to just enjoy each other and visit....piss mode starts again....trying to visit with  my girls and she is in tent.......MMMMMMMMMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM.....whinning like a two yr old....yes baby what do you need....i have a headache....i know baby...what do u want me to do about it .......crying some more and whinning in between.....i go sit back down....then she starts in with the other girls...they leave to go shower....she comes out of t
