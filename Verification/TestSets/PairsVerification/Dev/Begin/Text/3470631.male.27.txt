Even bigger than Woodstock - we're all set for Coventry Festival Aug 13-14 in Vermont. Should be a life changing event. Don Vito is on board with Lufkin and Lobron - RV arrangements need to be made asap. And when I say made - I mean Lobron - get your Credit Card out and rent us an RV bonus boy.   Can someone provide me with examples where a band of the magnitude of Phish had a farewell concert tour that culminated with a huge 2-day festival? Is this unprecedented? Am I overstating the significance of this event?   No. It will be life changing.   Last post before my Cross Country flight to San Fran tomorrow. I figured I'd state that I'm fully expecting it to be hijacked by a team of Arab hooligans. That way if it happens it would be historic that I documented it here a day before -- and I've never done anything historic in my life.  I just saved my life.
As of today, I am strangely detached from the reality  of the news. But I want to pass something along for  those who may need it: the ability to feel what I  attempt to describe below in the final sentences of  this writing - if indeed, you are one of the fortunate  and can feel it - will never leave, and will never  become any less vivid.   I have a different persective than many of you - what  is happening to you today happend to me, in a  different form, in August of 1995, when Jerry died.  The pain subsides, new routines and musical fixes are  found, some family stays with you and some does not -  but I am here to tell you that the detail never  leaves. On most Phish nights, when the lights dimmed,  I always had my eyes closed, and was again watching  Jerry walk out. Those stolen moments were never sad,  but always ecstatic for me. The energy, and the  passion never fade. The love never dims. The lessons  become clearer, and the music even sweeter. You'll  see. In decades to come, the little trick I try to use  below, at the end of this self indulgence, will work  just as well . . .   Regarding Phish: You've gotten what you paid for. And  you got off cheap.   Regardless of how much you paid - to Phish Inc.  directly, to the scene, in your relationships, with  your health or soul - you're in on the bargain of the  century. You bought the stock at .01 a share, and have  sold it at 1,000.00 per. Perhaps you don't know this .  . .   Now, the incidental fringe benefits are not to be  overlooked, nor disrespected: friends, lovers,  spouses, self-knowledge, expanded compassion, honed  capitalist skills, an amazing cd collection, travel,  adversity defeats and victories, maturation, blessed  emotional retarding to the joyous child-like levels,  and of course, lots and lots and lots of really  freakin' amazing music.   But. Allow me to remind you of the Great Intangible.  Of the Priceless Gift that you perhaps weren't e
