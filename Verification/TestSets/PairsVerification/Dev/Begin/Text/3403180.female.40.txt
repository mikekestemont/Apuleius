urlLink Educating for a Diverse America: A Summit and Symposium   University of Texas, Austin January 29-30, 2004   Remarks by President Michael M. Crow :  ......."So it is not unrealistic to start thinking about what change we want 50 years from now. In 2054 the very concept of diversity will change as we become a nation with no majority population. In 2054, with no majority population, we will be able to label ourselves nothing other than what Governor Wilder has suggested—all of us Americans, with no other label. We will be living in a post-dominant-culture America. Hallelujah:   no dominant culture. "

I trimmed some of the branches, as I'm sure the neighbor doesn't like the pods the way the birds do.  After being overheated for too long I took a nice swim.

Blend until smooth and liquefied. The important thing is to get the oil and peppers to liquefy so that the sauce can come together. There should not be parts of the pepper in oil, but rather a smooth sauce with the peppers assimilated into the oil. The ingredients are approximate so don't be afraid to trust your taste buds.
