After the argument with my father about buying my townhouse, I had a pretty good Saturday.  My friend Ken from high school (I also went to college with him) called to tell me that they were going out, and asked me if I wanted to come along.  His roommate from college, Jackson, was coming down, and I had a crush on Jackson in college.  The guy looks like a skinner version of Jake Gyllenhaal... but with a unibrow.  But, strangely, the unibrow is sexy.  I don't know if Jackson knew that I had the hots for him or not, but we had some sort of "connection."  He got too drunk for me to act on it, but I think I ruined it anyway.  Jackson and Ken's friends Jamie and Tony were out with us also.  It was basically me and 6 guys.  It was fun... I just watched them get totally wasted.  Me and Tony started talking and when he found out I used to be married, he automatically deemed me "sexy" and "naughty."  Interesting.  I ended up hooking up with Tony later that night, as well as Jamie.  That's where the "ruining" part came in.  I probably could have hooked up with Jackson, and initially I really wanted to, but I figured I ruined it and didn't want to seem like the group blow-up doll.  Anyway, I would have gotten too hopeful in spite of the fact that Jackson is working the Warped Tour and won't be around all summer.  I'm sure I'll see him again, but I'll probably feel awkward.  Hopefully he'll forget it all.  I really want to see Shawn.  I wish I could talk to him more.  Sometimes I feel weird hooking up with other guys, even though there is absolutely NOTHING going on with the two of us.  I feel like I'm letting him down somehow.  I probably shouldn't feel that way.  Matt hasn't called me, thank God.  I guess he got the picture after our weird night together.  Anyway, gotta go...  Any thoughts on Bush's address tonight??  Not that anyone reads this or would like to comment...
So my landlord calls this morning to say that she wants to sell the house.  But she wants to see if I want to buy it first.  OF COURSE I DO!  I am so tired of paying rent it's not even funny.  I'm so excited I could pee.  Then I call my parents to tell them the good news.  What does my dad say?  "No.  You're not doing it."  Hello?  I didn't call to ask your permission, I called to tell you the good news.  Then he starts ranting and raving about how I'm not divorced yet and if I buy the house before I'm divorced Pat will go after it and take half of the house.  I tried reasoning with him and saying that I highly doubted that, that I don't really talk to Pat, and that he doesn't have to know that I was buying it.  Of course, my father didn't want to hear it.  He w
