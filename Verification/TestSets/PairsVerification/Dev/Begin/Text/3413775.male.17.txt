I type 101 words per minute but it's in my own language.  I used to have really long hair, and people thought I was high all the time.  People always compare long hair with drug use.  I wish long hair was connected to something other than drug use.  Like, "An Extreme Longing For Cake."  A stranger would be all "That fucker eats cake.  He is on rum cake."  A mother would be all "Don't bring the cake eater over here anymore.  He smells like flour.  Did you see how excited he got when he found out your birthday was fast approaching?"  I've gotten the AIDS test about four times now, the AIDS test is scary.  Waiting for the results is frightening.  So I don't get the regular test anymore.  I get the round-and-about AIDS test.  I call my friend, and I go "Yo Brian, you know anyone who has AIDS? No? Cool.  Because you know me."  Mitch Hedberg.  Haha.
My god.  Am I the only one on Earth who thinks that Honey Bunches Of Oats is the best fucking cereal in the history of cereals?!
So I have actually accepted my fate at being the biggest loser ever.  I can now close my eyes and put my Final Fantasy soundtracks ( READ: All the released soundtracks.  About.. 20 including piano collections. ) on shuffle and hear the first 10 seconds and go, "TOWN THEME! FINAL FANTASY 6! NOBUO UEMATSU!"  Don't hate me because the Japanese make the good video game music.  Announcer: And now, Homicide: Life on Sesame Street.  Bert: (Answering phone) Hello? Son of a bitch. I'm on my way.  (Gets out of bed and gets dressed)  Bert: Some poor bastard got his head blown off down at a place called Hooper's.  Ernie: Bert, I wish you wouldn't drink so much, Bert.  Bert: Well, Ernie, I wish you wouldn't eat cookies in the   DAMN BED  .  Ernie: Bert, you're shouting again, Bert.   Music Currently Playing:  My Heart Bleeds the Darkest Blood by Shai Hulud  Wow.  Good song from a good band.  Talk about emo.  Too bad they're breaking/broken up.
So what a day it's been.  I woke up this morning with a killer charley horse in my leg, and man I have been walking around like a gimp for at least a week now since I also broke three toes.  Eventually I made it out of bed, because while laying there bordering between sleep and conciousness I thought, "Fuck.  I want a steak."  So off I went to Texas Roadhouse.  So I get there and there's people packed tight in the waiting area, so I go "Oh no.. This is ridiculous."  Turns out it was a party of thirty six!  So I got seated right away and proceeded to get the biggest steak on the menu.  It was   damn   good.  The baked potato was disgusting because they poured sour cream on it.  That thing had about 5 inches of sour cream on it.  That's about how my day went.  Am I the only one who is completely fed up with William Hung? I
