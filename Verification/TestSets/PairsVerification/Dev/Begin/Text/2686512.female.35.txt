once there was a time when all there was to life was working, partying, and feeding my two cats.  one husband, one dog, and two home-ownerships later, marriage has altered me a little . . . or perhaps simply polished facets of self i never knew i had!  i remain very much my self - imaginative, flirty, creative, thoughtful, outrageous, kind, curious.  i still enjoy partying, just not as often as i used to, and i still enjoy playing dress up, much to the husband's delight ;)  i still believe a lipstick or new hair colour = therapy.    new additions to the list of things i enjoy:  my new dryer  (no, really, it's LOVELY!)  my $279 vacuum cleaner  (after 12 years of denial and almost as many sorry-ass $60     attempts to avoid buying it, i gave in.  and yes, they are definitely worth it.  i think i could pick up my 115 lb dog with it if i wanted to!)  sheers   a not-so-new addition to this list is my love of power tools.  the great thing about marriage/homeownership is that i seem to have more opportunities to indulge!  i got a new ryobi drill from the inlaws for christmas, and today i screwed everything from drapery rods to shoe racks! (how kinky is that!)  being "handy" makes me feel so freakin' sexy! double entendre abounds when you're fiddling with power tools . . .  *sigh*  one more domestic goddess activity this weekend: i bought a spring-form pan and intend to make a vegetable cheesecake.  will share the recipe if it's a winner.
remember the slacking pig i mentioned in an earlier missive?  *WELL!* i found the cajones to go ahead and say "you're cramping my style."  i was going to do it face-to-face (hate confrontation, but prefer to address nasty things directly so as to cut the duration of the confrontation to a minimum) but time did not permit and so i ended up emailing three brief paragraphs.  i figured i had nothing to lose (contracts being up in the air and all) and that he'd either respond with "bitch, please"  or  go ahead and attempt to foster professional rapport.  he not only apologized for being a pain-in-the-ass, he promised improvement!  this exceeded my expectations and made my freakin' day.  everyone loves a return on investment!  other things that made my week: lunch on the bosses' dime, finding not one but three fun new bargains at the tj maxx, four pints on thursday night, and the arrival of the weekend.  oh, and i'm just pages away from finishing the book i've got to finish before delving into daniel brown's da vinci code . . . i can't wait!  thanks for reading (and for the times you talk back - i appreciate it!)
i'm totally NOT into that daytime talk show sob story stuf, but i must confess i do enjoy the random acts of kindness bit and sincerely appreciate it when something precious & beautiful finds its way into my life.  go visit my friend  urlLink styro  and look at the fantastic o
