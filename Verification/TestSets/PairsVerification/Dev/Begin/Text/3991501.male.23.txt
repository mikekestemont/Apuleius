The sun blazed on as if it were the Carboniferous era again and all plant life was meant to grow gigantic.  Remember gigantic?   equisetum  horsetails once had trunks with tinkertoy treetops.  The bark was a gunmetal sheen of soil extracted silicates.  The flow of water from deep roots kept turgid branches reaching.  Weeping stands dropped cones that felt like coconut husks.  Spores clouded parching sunsets.  Carbon dioxide kept its warm blanket on the sweaty Earth.  Horsetails grow in gardens, a noxious weed whose roots reach 30 feet under.  Brittle, they leave these deep threads when plucked by plucky weeders as reinforcements that can mole upwards in later months.
So I wanted to trade.  There is an instrument called an Orcana that sounds "good."  Its   "not too big, not too small."  The Orcana is mythical and luscious, an instrument that is for quietly jamming.  A phone call to the trader is cryptic.  Here's my address, her slightly slurred drawl reads out a distant location, near the Greater Vancouver Zoo.  (That's where a elephant was carted off a few years ago to the States since its buddy died). There is a shroud of controversy around the GVZoo.  It is not regulated.  It has animals in chain linked enclosures with little shelter.  Something is rotten in the monkey hut.  Ophelia, a 200 pound Anaconda, lithe despite her heft, has gotten into the hennery.  Hens swallowed whole perchance to dream a life beyond chain linked exhibition, find solace first in constricted extinction and weep nutrient tears collectively as snake bolus.  (Fantastic digression into fantasy.) Anyways, this lady lives near the zoo, and this Orcana she's trading ("Good sound, not too big not too small") will not pass hands easily.  A lilac won't do.   "I have enough lilacs already" What she really wants is a monkey puzzle tree.  Monkey puzzles, aka Araucaria araucana, are strangely shaped evergreens, reaching 150 feet high in their native South  America.  The monkey puzzle resembles a hundred million spiky rosettes of miniature aloe vera plants carefully impaled on branched shishkabob sticks stuck to a Christmas  tree trunk left in an alley to age until Easter.  This flagrant conifer sports gigantic gonadic cones the size of basketballs that take 2-3 years to mature and enclose up to 200 edible seeds.  Apparently they taste good and are one of the staples in the diet of the Pehuenche peoples of Chile.  The aforementioned seeds cost $25 US or 25Euros to procure from a grower in Victoria.  The plants I have seen at the Van Dusen Gardens' last Seedy Saturday for $15, they were only ten or twenty centimeters high.   Orcana be a pipe dream as long as monkey puzzle trees are sparsely available. BuySellTrade...hmmm.
Monkey tree's disappearance a puzzle  By Sandra Thomas-Staff writer  An East Side woman wants to know how thieves managed to steal a seven-year-old monkey puzzle tree from her front yard earlier this month and no one noticed.  Ellie Brede says she woke up one morning a few weeks ago to find a large hole where her much-loved tree once stood.  "I w
