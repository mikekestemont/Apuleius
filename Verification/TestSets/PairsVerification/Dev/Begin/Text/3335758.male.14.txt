Today was an O.k. day but really only because it was Friday!  Today at school it was the usual crap. Anyway today started out with science. SCIENCE SUCKS!! oh well we had a sub but the SUB SUCKED!! and to top it all off we had 3 pages of notes and a 3 page booklet of work to do! I finished the first page then got carried away talking to my friends. Second period wasn't any better be cause we had social... oh boy :( and guess what we had the SAME SUB AS SCIENCE FOR SOCIAL!!! WTFOMG!! this day just kept getting better (im being sarcastic!) we had to do 10 questions from the text book and a booklet on Brazil! Third period I had english and english sucked as usual because we're doing poetry:( ugh! I did a haiku. Anyways After english it was lunch time. I forgot my lunch today:( Oh well i had enough money for a chocolate bar:)Then it was time for Band practice UGH! I lied and said that i forgot my instrument cause i really don't like band practice at lunch that much... Then once it was over we had to go right back to our lockers to get our stuff for fourth period! In math we corrected a pop quiz that we had and i got 17.5/28 oh well i hope my mom doesn't see this cause she would be all... "You need to better in school or you won't get to do anything fun all you can do is study or read a book until i see a better mark!" routine! Ugh... Once math was over it was time for gym! Yay finally a period worth going to! I gym we still have our Tennis/Soccer/Football unit. Everyone was playing football except for a few people (like 3 or 4) So that was like 14 on 14! Anyway that is way too many people to play football the way we do! So we had a pretty crappy game! at least it was closer this Time around only 28 to 14 this time! lol! I didn't score any TD's but i got a couple 70 yard kick off returns! Yay! That was pretty much the only good things that we had going that game... Oh well. Then school was over and it was time FOR THE WEEKEND!!! The highlight of my day no dought! We started going and we saw an ambulance on the way home! and there was this crowd of people around this guy that was just lying there on the ground! Anyways I got home started up the computer then started typing this blog!  Anyways that was my day i'll blog tomorrow and tell ya what went on in a day of the life of Adam B.
