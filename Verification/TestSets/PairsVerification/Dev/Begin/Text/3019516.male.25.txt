Earlier I wrote about how I'd bought the final component for my new PC, but it turns out I was wrong. I managed to miss the fact that my motherboard doesn't have on-board video, so I needed a video card. I picked one up yesterday, plugged it in, and fired up my PC for the first time. There's a slight problem with the floppy drive, but apart from that, the as-yet-unnamed PC is fully functional.  I have yet to install the operating system, because: a) the keyboard is a fancy affair that needs a special driver installed before it can send function keystroke signals and b) the Windows XP installation requires you to press F8 to say you agree to the licence. I'll try plugging it into a USB port instead of its current PS/2 port tonight.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - I'd post pictures, if I had any. PPS - Maybe some other time.
How do you prioritise when everything is urgent and none of it is easy? That is, everything will take some time to do, it needs to be done really quickly, and there is more than one project behaving like this. I'm at a loss.  When things get hectic, I tend to fold over and let myself fail. I've never found out why that might be. Perhaps I don't believe in myself or my abilities enough. But when I think of it that way, it doesn't paint the whole picture. I don't think I fear success, though I do shy away from both compliments and criticism. "Let me do my own thing at my own pace, and keep your opinions to yourself", I seem to say.  Unfortunately, this is not the way the world works. I'm not supposed to make myself an island. I don't think I am. I'll ask for help when I need it and I think you can provide it. But when the phrase "my responsibility alone" crosses my mind, it's all over.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - Hopefully, one day, I'll run out of introspective things to say here. PPS - Maybe when I'm eighty or so.
Last night I forgot to set my alarm clock, so this morning I was glad that I still live with my Dad who still makes sure that meal times are family times. I was up a little later than I planned, but when I rearranged my morning routine, everything fitted in nicely and I still had time for fifteen minutes of reading before I left for work.  I'm breezing through Isaac Asimov's " I, Robot " partly because it's a classic I recently bought and partly because I've seen a trailer for the upcoming movie. It looks to me like the movie will be incredibly unfaithful to the Three Laws and Asimov's vision for the world of robots. To be sure, his stories usually involve something going wrong with a robot, but the movie shows blatant breakage of the First Law on a wide scale by thousands of robots. The story as I remember it never had a
