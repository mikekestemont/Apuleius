Good day for family. Spent the day at Doug's to celebrate my cousin Diep's birthday. What is she now.. 24? We're all grown up! Had a big water balloon fight just like when I was a kid.. But now its fair because I'm bigger than everyone. Good food........ Good people.... Played poker.. took everyone's money. Just chillin and shit... I like that.  Yesterday was cool too.. spent the day with Dianne. Paul and Thuy came over to play games... we didn't play anything and watched movies. Collateral was good.. funny though cuz it extracted weird.. think the file's corruted... but i had to do it like 3 times.. and we missed out on like the last 2 minutes.. but that's ok.. Then the other cousin came over... and something happened that will change my life forever...  Ever here of Veet????? That stupid shit for shaving ur legs!!! Omg. They used me as the guinea pig... and it turned out it didn't work very well.. And my leg was all fucked up and weird.. so i had to shave it all off.... But, iono.. my legs are kinda nice and smooth now. Feel kinda sassy and shit.. HAHA!!! Don't make fun!  That's All for right now... I am the Walrus; g00 g00 g'j00b.

So, I microwaved five corndogs.  And that's my time... I am the Walrus; g00 g00 g'j00b.
We all had a good day today. Went to the block to catch a movie. We had to decide between AVP or Without A Paddle... AVP... Without A Paddle... I didn't really care. Both of those movies didn't seem that good. We all ended up watching AVP; it was better than I thought, but it was still bad--- especially because of the ending. I present an alternate ending. One that I know everyone would enjoy:  Anyways instead of that one predator dying from the alien queen and getting impregnated by her alien seed, he, with the help of the black human chick, defeats the queen in an awesome display of agility and strength. The predators accept the chick as one of there own, and she then travels to there native planet where she is preserved within the alien atmosphere---which is good for your skin---for the next hundred years. She comes back to earth one hundred years later to experience h
