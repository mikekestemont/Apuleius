So. New Journal. "Secret"-y.  Now I can say anything..and not have people yell at me for it. Go me. I just spent about half and hour trying to resize and get a picture online, but it's quite annoying so i gave up. I might try again later, but who knows.  On a fashion note (lyke, omg.), I am getting new  shoes  Sometime this week. This rainy, rainy week. Man, i hope that link thing worked. It would be amazingly cool. I'm also starting to wonder if my Go-Kart Records T-shirt wil ever come. I doubt it. It's been almost a month. But they said allow up to 4 weeks...Still. Pushing it.  I think Free Hats is going to practice this week, or this weekend. We have to, if we plan to get a show. I think i'll write songs in my new, small, floppy notebook, which is from the 80's, and awesome. Ha, the only real songs we have are "My mom thinks i'm cool", which is sort of a dumb song made up by Mike Rogers, and A.D.D. by The Unseen. Ah well. Good times. Speaking of Mike, Me, Him, and Baner all plan to go on down to LBI this summer to his hot-assed Bay-Beach-House. Maybe get a Show or two..Skinny dip the bay. Just a good time.   So long, first entry.
I hate blogspot.    Bye.
Mike Rogers and I have created our very own...well lots.  1) DEVIANT ART ACCOUNTS!   Mike - Donkey-Explosives   Me - Beyond-AD  2) COMIC THING!   Further bulletins warrant.  3) BAND THING!    But you knew that already.     The end.
So i had this really long fight with Chris and Brittany Duwallo and i so won. They won't mess with us again. I emailed the conversation to alex.   In other news, Free Hats had their first practice. We didn't really get much done, but we made progress. I'm writing like 2 songs right now. One's sort of all punkish and then the other one is more...indie-ish? I guess. For lack of better words.  So the Jazz-Ska-Punk-Fusion band idea is going over well. It's now my "side project", and i might get Dan in on it.   And me and monique have so many problems...I don't want to be mad at her all the time, but when she likes someone i just get like...so jealosus and/or mad. I don't know why. I feel like i need someone and to know that they like me, and feel compeltely secure. It's so fucked up, and she would never understand. I don't want to lose her because of this. Would i go so far to say that i love her? I don't know. It seems a tad too dramatic. And kinda lame. But man, i would lose so much without her.
I've done alot of things today. I'm actually really proud of myself. It's kinda ironic, during school, i got no work done, but now that school is pretty much over, i'm working all the time.  I finished my Math Final. Both sections were really much easier than i expected, i think i did well, p
