Wow, I got my Americas Army account back...with ALL the training completed... Hmm, maybe it's their present for fucking up the login servers.  Bet they will put it back lol. Finallly downloaded Steam again, onto my fresh hard drive... But Doom 3 is so close, every other game seems so boring!!  Oh, and I'm hot...temperature I mean :P Really hot :(  I'm gonna go get some water... And this will be all for now, can't think of anything to say, I have a boring life :( :S
I formatted my hard drive today and re-installed Windows and stuff. Installing my modem is a pain though, still, everything is working so now I can browse the net [pr0n]!  Hmm, not much else I can say lol. Oh, I'm starting my Web designer course on Monday... good fun :D  Doom 3 is almost here, can't wait... Just can't wait... feck I'm so bored, and games seem boring, 'coz I'm looking forward to Doom 3 so much...  Well, I guess that will be all for now.
Haven't posted for a while.   I've got a new friend, Faye :D hello *waves*. You can see her journal as well by clicking the link in the friends list on the right.   I've been playing Americas Army quite a lot now. I mean the game you fool, visit  urlLink http://www.americasarmy.com  for more information. Anyway, it seems at about 6pm everyday I can't seem to login to my account, which means I can't play online :( For god sake, I was enjoying the game. Stupid Americans! Fix it lol, I want to play.   Doom 3 is nearly here as well. 16 days to go until it comes out. I am gonna get mine from  urlLink http://www.mx2.co.uk  because they have the special edition there for about Â£24 which is a deal and half lol. *sigh* Another great thing about PC games, they are much cheaper!   What else am I doing...ah yes, slowly putting things on Dark Rose:  urlLink http://www.darkroseweb.tk  I made a web template for it. But I must tell you that it was Chrono's idea (he's a friend, look in my friend's list). You can have a look at the template  urlLink here . Now you can see why I said it was Chrono's idea :P   I'll try and post more when I get the time, my sister is still into PC gaming :( It's nice, that another member of the family has the same interest as me, but I'm gonna get annoyed if I can't use my PC when I want, and we only have one :(   That's all for now. Buh bye!
OK, I changed the stuff to red again... &nbsp; Red is my favourite color and blogs are personal things, so I thought I'd have the links and titles and stuff red. So ner :P &nbsp; I'll post a photo of myself (instead of that bear lol) so that you can all see how minging I am... well I might, I'm scared of paedo's... Well who isn't? It's just that I'm 16, that's all, so at this age I
