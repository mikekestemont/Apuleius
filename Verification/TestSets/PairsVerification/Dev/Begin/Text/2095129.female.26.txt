So today the news is mainly about a possible terrorist threat, a plane possibly being hijacked from Canada to hit a U.S. target, lots of scary "clear and present danger" talk.  Apparently they are just re-releasing old details because they think there is an "imminent" attack.  The thing is, every time this stuff hits the news, I do get nervous.  Tell me I am paranoid, and just slightly too far under the influence of the American fear machine.  I'm sure I am.  But the thought of risking anything to go to this miserable client meeting next week just makes me angry.  Actually, it's the thought that I even have to consider this stuff that makes me really angry.  But anyway.  Game 2 tomorrow night - Go Flames Go!  And it sure does look like  urlLink the mayor of San Jose is a good sport .
My uncle died last night, from cancer.  The memorial service will be the same weekend as my grandmother's, in June.  A and I already have made travel arrangements to be in Kingston then.
urlLink      So tonight we find out who  urlLink Calgary  is going to play in the Stanley Cup Finals.  I'm still getting over the fact that we are IN the finals.  I mean, I have been a Flames fan since I moved here, and A has been one pretty much his whole life, so we have gone to as many games as we could - but we never even guessed it would get this good.  I mean, the freaking FINALS!!!!  I am a LITTLE excited.  I have to admit to a huge crush on Miikka too.  I just like how calm and modest he seems, and heck - he's an amazing player.  The picture above is the only I've ever seen when he's smiling.  Maybe it's a Finnish thing, who knows.
Last night we went to see Troy in Eau Claire, and then had a beer.  The movie made me think of my  urlLink first year Archaeology course , with the German professor (can't remember his name), who was so completely the stereotypical professor of Classical Studies, and how we'd have to memorize a bunch of slides, then write one-pagers on them for the exam.  I honestly don't think I retained much of anything.  I mostly remember how he described how  urlLink Schliemann  had excavated Troy but done it wrong, so all the layers were jumbled up, to support his own theories - which ended up confusing everyone interested in ancient Greek culture for years.     The movie was pretty good, even if kind of predictable ("Hey!  The Trojan horse!", "When is Achilles' heel going to come into it?").  Peter O'Toole was great, the actor who played Hector was really good as well, and Brad was, well, Brad.  We did see his naked bum again.  Yum.
I can't stand the leaders' debate.  I wish I could just stand up there, ask a question, and say "if anyone interrupts anyone else, consider yourself having lost my vote."  Honestly, it's so completely unproductive.  Paul Martin seemed flustered, and Jack Layton d
