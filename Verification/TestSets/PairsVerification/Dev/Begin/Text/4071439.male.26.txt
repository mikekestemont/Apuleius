Finally the week is over. This is good and bad. Good cuz it's  urlLink party time , bad cuz next week when I get back to work, there'll only be me and Max left from the bunch graduate students that used to hang out. All the others have finished theirinternships already. It sucks and I'm getting relly fed up of working.  Earlier this week I bumped into an Irish girl I know at  urlLink l'Escalier , a popular after hours bar, and since I kinda fancy her I asked if she'd like to go out. She said "yes" and gave me her (irish) number. Thing is I don't know if it's worth it. I'm only here for another month and that's short for a relationship to get going. On the other hand, she might be open to  urlLink casual sex ?   Fat chance!  But I'll probably send her a message and we'll see what happens after that. Have great fkin weekend!  urlLink Enjoy! !

Bob Dylan would probably not have approved of having a web site anyways.
urlLink Blekinge, SWEDEN &nbsp;- A 18-year old girl in&nbsp;a small town in the south of Sweden has&nbsp;found a video camera hidden in a vent in the bathroom of her appartment.&nbsp;When following the cables&nbsp;she&nbsp;discovered a television set, a video recorder and several video cassettes&nbsp;in an abandoned storage space&nbsp;in&nbsp;the basement. As far as she knows, the camera&nbsp;might have been there since she moved in this May. That's yuckie, cuz i think we all know what the perv was doing while watching those recordings...
So what do I do now? I don't really know. I know what I'm doing at the moment, but that doesn't really help me much. I'm currently working for IBM France&nbsp;in Nice on the French Riviera. Working might not be the right word though, I'm actually doing an internship for my master thesis. With some luck I'm graduating from  urlLink Ecole des Mines  in September.&nbsp;   I've only got 2 weeks left, and they fkin dumpt a shitload of work on me today, so I decided to blog. Vengeance with a twist.
This is where I live :   &nbsp;  La Bay des Anges in Nice on&nbsp;the French Riviera
Tomorrow is my last day as a trainee at IBM in La Gaude. This means I'll have to turn in the beautiful laptop that has b
