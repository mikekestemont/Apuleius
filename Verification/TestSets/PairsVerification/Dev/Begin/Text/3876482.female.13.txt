Mommy and I were supposed to hang out.&nbsp; When she got up the power went out, so we showered a the Henderson's house in Powhatan.&nbsp; Then I got a donut, which I had been craving since 3 in the morning.&nbsp; That donut made me feel sick  all day .&nbsp; After my donut we went to the eye doctor.&nbsp; I have a stigmatism in each eye.&nbsp; I had to pick out frames and I'm very picky because I just can't do glasses.&nbsp; Mommy got mad and yelled at me, that basically was the start of a really bad day.  She apologized for yelling at me, but I could tell that she really did mean it when she said I was "plucking her last nerve," so it still hurt.&nbsp; Then we went appraising.&nbsp; I got really bored during house number 1.&nbsp; I just sat there for ever and ever.&nbsp; Then we went to appraise the second house, we couldn't stop before we got there and I really had to use the bathroom.&nbsp; Then we had to take pictures of 4 or 5 other houses.&nbsp; I almost peed myself.  After that mommy took me to Panera bread.&nbsp; Tia called while we were in line and was really angry.&nbsp; Some stuff went on in at the office that I won't get into.&nbsp; It was a lot of drama and I felt bad because it shouldn't have happened.&nbsp; Neither one of us ate.  We went to mommy's interview.&nbsp; I had to stay in the car.&nbsp; I was feeling really bad then, so I put my seat back and tried to sleep.&nbsp; I had Sleeping at Last on, they made me feel a little bit better.&nbsp; I napped on and off for about an hour.&nbsp; Mommy came back and we drove back to the office.&nbsp; It was the longest ride I've ever taken.&nbsp; Mommy's cell phone went off more than normal.&nbsp; Everyone was all upset and I just had to sit back and listen to my mom pour everything out to me.&nbsp; That made me really sad because there was nothing I could do to help her.  We got back to the office, I just got online and pretended I wasn't there.&nbsp; I didn't want to be there.&nbsp; We left for the orthodontist, mommy was on the phone the whole ride there and the whole&nbsp;time we were in the lobby.&nbsp; I found out that if I don't wear my headgear more I'll end up having surgery.&nbsp; Uh-oh.&nbsp; I missed guitar because of mommy's bad schedualing skills.  We got back&nbsp;to the office and were supposed to leave almost once we got there.&nbsp; Mommy just wanted to change.&nbsp; Well, we were there for an hour.&nbsp;  A very long hour .&nbsp; &nbsp; Then we went shopping.&nbsp; Nothing really special happened.&nbsp; I got lots of pairs of soffee shorts because they're comfy and mommy said "get as many as you want."  The guy in Arbys recognized me.&nbsp; It was kind of nice to see someone who looked like they hadn't just had the worst day of their life.&nbsp; We got A
