So...I've entered this new mood that I've never really felt before. I'm aloof to everything pretty much (oddly enough this seems to make my driving better). BUT, I'm on the edge being set off easily. By set off I mean that if  anyone was to reprimand me then I'll go psycho on their tail. Maybe that's clear now.  Now for the big news. I know as I type this that no one out there is gonna believe me. I know I wouldn't. But I'm gonna continue and you can choose to believe it or to not believe it. When I logged off last night and was about to hop in the bed, I saw...[bum bum bum]...the THING. It was sitting beside my bed on the floor. Now, I know your thinking...wait...he said it died. Yes, it did die. I watched it. But there it was, on the floor, alive and meaner than ever. I didn't go into shock completely when I saw it and I decided I was gonna figure it out and study it (plus I wanted to see if its evil soul would spring out of it like it did last time). I ran past it and grabbed some tissues to pick it up with. Upon my arrival back to the bed, it was still there but it saw me coming to get it and it ran under my bed. I thought to myself...you fool. I knew I was gonna get it. I looked under the bed and what did I find right where it ran under? This weird looking kind of screw that I've never seen before in my life. Of course, at first, I just assumed it ran faster than I thought. So I placed the screw elsewhere and continued looking under my bed. I was almost completely under my bed looking for that thing. It wasn't there. I grabbed my cell phone to aid me with some light under the bed and it didn't help me find it either. I then proceeded to look under: my fouton, my nightstand, some clothes lying on the floor, my dresser, my desk, and even outside my room. Then I came back to my room and just started thinking about why this bug was harassing me so much. I then decided that the bug had turned into a screw. That's where you say "you're full of crap". But after seeing its evil soul pop out at our previous encounter, I don't put anything by the THING. Then I laid down to sleep and prayed and came up with the idea that perhaps this THING was a weird sign from God. He didn't answer me when I asked. He was probably too busy rolling around and laughing in heaven. I'm so confused about this dumb THING. There's not telling what may happen tonight or tomorrow but you can count on me keeping you updated. :) *Remember: If no one ever posts comments if gonna feel like a retard for putting all this on the web.
