Send me a message!     urlLink Are you a REAL Evanescence fan, or just pretending to be?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      You are Captain Jack Sparrow. You're fun loving, boisterous and a little full of yourself. You tend to look out for your own interests- although you have a compassionate side; you'll only help others if it benefits you as well. Rarely are you serious about anything. Like many people, you're just trying to be free. You also somehow manage to look masculine despite the fact that you wear mascara and move like a drag queen.    urlLink    Which Johnny Depp are You?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      Twitch ~ You think that little Twit is the cutest?

(*HOLES*) [for girls]     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      You want to cuddle squid*-*  Maybe its the fact of his badboy attitude...or maybe its the fact of him not knowing HOW to keep his mouth SHUT!

Really you are. And you definitely have a reason. You often space out and stare at things blankly, even if you're normally hyper and energetic. This is because nothing really seems important anymore. You might just be sad right now, or you might be manic depressive. Don't worry. Have some cocoa and stuff'll be ok.     urlLink   How Depressed are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      Dark magician.
