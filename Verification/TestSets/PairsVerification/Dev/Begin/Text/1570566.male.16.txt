Tomorrow is Friday.......good. I like how I act like I have been at school for a long time.....when it's been a week. I hope I get to hang out with Lindsey tomorrow I am with her a lot, but she could never be boring so I am always hoping I can hang out with her. She is so fun, I could not ask for anyone better, she is perfect for me....I hope she knows that. I will now make like I am on the skyway.........and cruise out on the highway.....?
No school! That rocks! I am just sitting here doing nothing and loving it because.....it's not school. Only one bad thing......I don't get to see Lindsey. I miss her. Well.....I think the Porth is coming over here in a little bit. I don't really have too much to say. I am going to make like a flamin and go.
Okay guys, I miss her! Lindsey is perfect and I am so lucky. She makes me have so much fun while doing the smallest things like sitting on my couch......I am so happy. I wish we could have all the time in the world together, but I am extremely happy with what I have and I could never ask for better than Lindsey. I shall make like a tan and go.
Today was a swell one brought to me by someone I like and care about very much. Her name is Lindsey, and after school we went for a walk at Ha Ha Tonka and I had a great time. After this swell time in my life, Jake proceeded to cometh to my house and we recorded some weird things, and then after that Tyler came over and we played some songs of ours. Well that is my day minus the school. I am outta here like the troposphere. The Prime Stinister

Today was a really good day, for a Monday. I got most my scores back from finals, and well my grades should be straight A's which is really freaking cool. I don't have any homework either and sometimes I sit here and wonder why I tell this to the computer.......weird. I got to see Lindsey after school like usual so that was cool. Well I don't have too much to say, hope you like the track you are probably hearing right now. Now I am out like trout.
WELL.....the finals have been defeated. It's over and done. I think I did horrible on my language final and I was very upset for a long time, but being with Lindsey after school today really cheered me up. Something about her........she's perfect for me I believe. Well, I a
