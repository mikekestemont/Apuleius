During the course of the last few days, I"ve discovered that people do not liked to be talked to or harassed, stalked- if you prefer, too much. They just don't like it. So, I've made a concession to myself to do as much stalking, harassing, and reticulating as can be done by one person over the internet. The way I figure it, just reading what goes on in peoples' lives is interesting for a while, but the persuit of pissing people off is much more worthy.       In other news, Happy Birthday to Drew, even though he doesn't read this; drop him a card at   urlLink  lknessm@aol.com   . Wish him a happy birthday and make someone's life just that much better.             [seacrest out]
Welcome to the Post of Joe; the first ever "Official" post on this blog. Nothing much makes it official, just that I am writing from work, and that's official.  Nothing is much happening with me. Nothing ever happens with me. I'm just uninteresting.  And tell me this- what's with every adult I meet thinking that they can be my mentor? Seriously, everyone that hears that I don't do homework and that I'm fighting to get back in school takes me aside and gives me "their advice". Which, in reality is the same thing over, and over, and over, and over, etc., again. I know that they have all of the greatest intentions, but the next time someone does it, I'ma go all Tia Vang on their ass and beat them into a bloody pulp, samurai style.  That about does it for me, until I go home tonight and decide that I'm bored, so I'll probly post again.  Because I know you all want me to.    [seacrest out]
I'm like Dr. Suess, but more alive and less good at ryming.      And no, I don't write poetry that get's posted on me little sighty here.      I think I've pretty much got nothing to write about- I went to work this morning, delivered 80 tires to Menominee, went back to the house of wares, and updated pricing all afternoon. Interesting shit, really. I think I promised Jordan a personalized post, but I don't think she wants me to; and anyway, I really don't know anything about url's or anything that's needed to do actual cool shit here.      So until this dies or I show some signs of interest, this is the format, style, and way the blog will be forever.      And ever.       Amen.              [seacrest out]
Have you ever wondered when you would be promoted to the rank of adult? I have. And then I thought that I was. But then, as soon as it was "given", it was taken away...      Kudos to Jordan-            [seacrest out]
Ahh, what a wonderful day.  To awaken to the sounds of birds chirping and cows mooing, there's nothing like it.       I did learn something today though- it seems as though every friend I have that has a problem thinks that it is the end of the world.  And then, I get all worried and try to think of things I c
