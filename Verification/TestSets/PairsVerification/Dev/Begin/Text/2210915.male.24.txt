Apparently the keyword that has brought the most visitors to my site is &quot;toddler&quot. In these Michael Jackson obsessed times, I have to consider the sexual aspect of these searches, and frankly the idea of someone whacking one out over a twenty-two year old picture of me is hilarious.  Today I got the wrong bus back from work, probably something to do with my ridiculously high blood sugar levels. This bus delivered to me three more ill-advised Christmas houses, including the mother of them all. It has lights - still, flashing and animated. It has a Father Christmas on the roof. It has a Christmas tree. It has three enormous inflatables lit with spotlights. I expect on Christmas Day Donner and Blitzen will be flying in the sky above with laser beams on their antlers. Everyone on the bus looked at it as one might look as a UFO. It was astonishing.  Come to think of it, I think it might be legendary. Frog told me someone drove him to see a very similar house last year. Could they be one and the same?
Firstly, a disclaimer: I'm not normally this grotesque. Well, not always. OK, I'm quite often this grotesque but I'm normally very charming about it.  The following is quite an everyday UK office story. In fact, the longer I stay in this office, the more I realise quite how true to life  urlLink The Office  is. Today two things happened in the name of  urlLink Children in Need . Firstly, King Tubby - the annoying halfwit who sits on my pod and twitters away incessantly - had his head shaved. He knew this was going to happen and yet he still came in with gel on his hair. Needless to say it was painful and he whinged a lot. This is King Tubby's forte.   Secondly, there was a doughnut eating competition. Seven people entered. Within the space of five doughnuts there were three of us left: Old Punk, Rugby Player and me. Old Punk, despite his slight build, was putting them away pretty quickly. Rugby Player was by now the hotly-tipped winner. I was calmly eating my way along in third place. Everyone was getting pretty whipped up, in that peculiarly smutty British way. My boss told me very sternly "Don't lick and don't wipe!" and then she turned red, burst out laughing and spent the next two minutes in embarrassed hysterics.  So, as we came groaning to our doughnut climax the scores stood as follows: Rugby Player was leading with 14 doughnuts in his belly and further one in his hand; Old Punk was second with his thirteenth partially digested; I was third and slowly masticating my way through my twelfth. Old Punk was looking smug, his goatee coaked in sugar and strawberry jam. In fact, he looked too smug, and very quickly the smile was wiped off his face as he started retching. He held it in all the way to the toilets. I think vomiting is grounds for disqualification, but he did damn well considering h
