Turning onto third There's a bird hopping away from the cafe With a piece of bread or something Just a few feet to avoid me Between two generations of sidewalk Sprinkled leaves and cigarettes And bits of paper find the cracks
This evening I went up to this beautiful uptown apartment to see about the writing group. I've been getting their emails for a few months now, I may as well see what it's about, right? At first I thought it was going to be awkward because there were only four people there or so and I was definitely the youngest. At the end there were about twenty. As far as I could tell, it was a very polite, nice group of people. The leader, Z, really held it all together. I heard a few bad pieces and a few good pieces. The effect of forcing myself to stay in one place and write continuously for a whole hour was incredible. I came up with a few very lucid passages.

My zendo will most likely be the mildewy basement of a church, but that's fine.

Never have been. My body knows what's right for it. For example, I start to crave eggs when I haven't had them in a long time. I crave the taste of the yolk after its been hard-boiled. And I know in my bones that the right was to cut a PB&J is vertically, to release the flavor (and to maintain the greatest degree of symmetry). I'm all about biofeedback.
The first post. What to say. Just finished watching game one of the NBA finals. Basketball is the first sport I have ever watched. I grew up in a sports-free home, well, except for tennis. So my friends watch it all the time and I'm clueless. Why does Hamilton have that plastic on his face? But I'm starting to get into it. "He kind of reminds m
