People who go tanning don't look attractive... they look stupid.  Why don't you just cut out the middleman and slop some cancer right on your skin?     Pass the cancer, please.   Oh, and another thing...   This is not the Patrick and Sam Variety Hour. Idiotic, drug-induced rantings get real old, real fast (unless i'm making them). So post some content for once.
