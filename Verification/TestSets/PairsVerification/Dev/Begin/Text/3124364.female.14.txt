dang its been a while. ight well last night i spent the night with like my best friend...ummm named....Mary. We had a great time! her boyfriend and his friend came over. his friend is a freshman....in college. and yeah. mary and her bf were all makin out and the freshman...think think, named Caleb was all like kinda flirting with me. icky. the guy is sweet but he's kinda wierd. but yeah caleb and i had fun like pillow fighting and thumb wrestlin. he wants to be in the marines so he was all like "touch my muscles" or not. they left around midnight. then mary sis and her friends came home around 1, only to find me and mary raiding the pantry for pop-tarts. we finally got to bed around like 2:30. we had softball yesterday. i should have "kept my f***ing mouth shut" according to mary's sis about being catcher. i hate it, and especially during the summer doesnt look like much fun. i went to target today. i love target, but not nearly as much as WALLY WORLD. walmart rocks for real. i'm getting some of my pix developed from canada. i gotta finish my other roll. but a.g. called last night and said she's gonna send me some pix of me and her. something to look forward to. gah, i gotta go to school tomarrow and take some exams. i think i'll take 5 tomarrow and then 3 the next day. i will be so damn happy when exams are done. the whole universe is already out of school. it'll be wierd, me being the only kid at school with all the teachers. oh well. basktball starts like  sunday. i'm overly enthusiastic. probably too enthusiastic considering i'll probably just sit on the bench anyways. B said she wants me to jump ball, thatd be cool. but i just cant shoot, hopefully that will be fixed this summer. i really wanna go on vacation. i need to get away from my family. i never get along with my father but gah, i cant stand it. alrighty, i gotta go and talk to some of my peeps! love to everyone!
