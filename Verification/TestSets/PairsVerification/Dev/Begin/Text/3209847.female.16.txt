hi-dee-ho, this is taylor..   I'm really feeling awful at the moment. I was having SUCH a great day. But, "what goes up must come down". And I've come down fast. I hurt very badly right now. Like I could die within 5 minutes. I have trouble coping with pain. I'm sorry if I hurt you Sarah. She tried to cheer me up, but it didn't work very well. I only made her hurt. I feel like such an inadequate partner when I'm like this. I can't take care of myself and I can't take care of her all at the same time. It's such a terrible feeling. I love you Sarah, remember that. Well I don't really feel like writing much more. Chemistry test was easy. I hope everyone had a great day! Tomorrow's friday. That's always good. *kiss and hug* to Sarah. bye bye
hey there hi there ho there.  lol it's sarah.  just another school day.  god i'm so sick of this.  it's almost over.  the only thing i REALLY want to end is calculus.  okay next week is gonna suck for me cuz i have to come to school for first, second, and fifth period, then after school for chess rehearsal.  so there's not even really a point in me leaving.  then wednesday i have my ap calculus exam, thursday i have my ap lit and comp exam.  and don't even get me started about the week after and all the graduation shit i have to do.  if you have any ideas for my salutatorian speech, they would be greatly appreciated.  that's all i have to say, except *kisses* to taylor! out
Hello everyone (Taylor speaking)!  This is the last post of April 28 (sad, i know) but anyways...    I GOT MY CELL PHONE BACK!!!  oh my goodness! i have missed it oh so much! I got it taken away like 4 weeks ago? Well, I just missed it! It's such a part of me! I don't know, finally Sarah can call me again, without having to talk to my parental figures, what a saving grace! I am so thoroughly excited! This day could not be better.. well maybe.. if i had some fudge or some cookies or be out all night, you know, those unattainable things! anyways, enough ranting about chocolate and parties, i'll be gone! Have a great night everyone *kiss* to Sarah, and I will post sometime tomorrow! bye-bye
Hey Everyone, Taylor speaking...  I had a  GREAT  day today! WE (me and sarah, of course) had a great day. So first of all, I get to see Sarah all dressed up! She looked so adorable. Today at school, the ring and pin ceremony was held. How fun is that?... yeah that's what I think! But it lasted a pretty long while and I got to see Sarah, so it was worth it. The juniors today were VERY excited about their new class rings, which they should be! Everyone was very excited. It was a good day. I had to perform my scene in Acting, which wasn't very g
