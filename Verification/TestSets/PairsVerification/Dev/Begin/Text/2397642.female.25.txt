It's Wednesday I am sooo ready for the weekend to get here... I gots me a 4 day weekend.. The in-laws are coming out for the weekend... It will be nice to see my mom-in-law and sis-in-law... It has been a long time... Robbie is excited.. He loves it when they come out... So do I at least I get a nice break away from him.... I am not sure what we are doing yet but on Saturday it is supposed to be crappy... I just hope at least one of the days they are here it is nice... Robbie is alot better now...he still has a cough but it is not as bad as it was the other day... Gotta get the van fixed because when I slow down the van shakes... I get to do that tomorrow... Fun FUN!!!! So well not much else going on... My buddy Kevin has a brand new neice and a brand new nephew. The neice is his brothers daughter and the nephew is his sisters son... almost 2 years ago his sister and sister-in-law had boys a month apart from each other... Pretty cool... Soo well... not much else... oh Troy is at a baseball game tonight with his co-workers... Baseball games are not high on my list considering that the last one I went too my mom passed away and I had to fly (the first time mind you) back to Toledo last summer... was not fun... But life will go on... gotta run.. Later Days...
Ahhh a brand new day... This morning I woke up to the sounds of a crying 3 year old because his poor tummy was hurting... The little guy is feeling much better... THANK THE LORD!!!! I really hate it when he is sick... He is clingy, crys more and I have no time for myself... OH wait but that is why I love being his mommy... So anyways... Troy decides that he wants to make ice cream... yummy.. We went to Home Depot yesterday to pick up a few things. Troy came across an ice cream maker... So being the good wife I am I said all right pick it up... So he did... I have to admit it was pretty cool watching this thing make ice cream... And it tastes good!!!!!! Yummy Yummy in my tummy... HE HE!!!! Well that is about it... Some news from the home front... My little brother graduated from high school this past friday... Troy was saying man I remember when he was going to be a freshman... I actually kinda feel old... It dawned on me that my little sister Kathy is going to be a junior next year and that means in only 2 short years she will be graduating...
