Isso dizia numa carta escrita em 1991 a uma amiga. Eu tinha 14 anos, da para acreditar! Entao, mudei de vida ou nao? Sim, e muito! 1991 - 14 anos, estudante, residindo em Natal/RN/Brasil. 2004 - 27 anos, secretaria numa firma de advocacia, residindo em New York a 3 anos, longe da familia, longe dos antigos amigos, mas muitos amigos novos, um novo lar. Nesses 13 anos muita coisa mudou alem do meu endereco. Na cartinha de amigas q moravam em cidades diferentes eu dizia que queria 'mudar, mudar, mudar'. Ainda tenho esse mesmo desejo de mudar, essa sede de explorar lugares ainda desconhecidos por mim, ver as coisas de minha propria otica. 'Paris e linda!!!', 'London e fria e cinzenta.' Eu quero dizer o que eu acho, nao repetir o ponto de vista de outros. Provavelmente vou constatar o mesmo.

Seeing that the man was showing signs of discouragement, Satan decided to enter the picture by placing thoughts into the man's weary mind: "You have been pushing against  that rock for a long time, and it hasn't budged. Why kill yourself over this? You are never going to move it." This gave the man the impression that the task was impossible and that he was a failure, these thoughts discouraged and disheartened the man. "Why kill myself over this?" he thought. "I'll just put in my time, give the minimum effort and that will be good enough." And that is what he planned to do until he decided to make it a matter of prayer and take his troubled thoughts to Jehovah. "Jehovah, I have labored long and hard in your service, putting all my strength to do what you have asked of me. Yet, after all this time I have not even budged that rock by half a millimeter. What is wrong? Why am I failing?" Then Jehovah responded compassionately, "When I asked you to serve and you accepted, I told you that your task was to push against the rock with all your strength, which you have done. Never once did I mention to you that I expected you to move it. Your task was to push. And now you come to me, with y
