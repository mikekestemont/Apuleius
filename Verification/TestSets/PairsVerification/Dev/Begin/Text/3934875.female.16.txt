hello.. i just got back frm dinner with my family. i went to town in the afternoon with nana. Nana! ur hair damn nice man!! I wanna cut like urs too..!! We met at arnd 2 plus and made our way.. Went to visit Linda at her Pizza Hut Centrepoint. For awhile onli.. Cos she had to get back to work after her break. When we reached the pizza hut, nana and me realised we were getting hungry even though i just ate b4 i went out! God.. Im piling on fast kilos.. Damn my metabolism rate! So we decided to walk to Far East's Sakura. One of our fave restaurants. There, i ate the usual tomyam claypot and nana ordered Thai Kway Teow.. Nice late lunch we had considering that we had our 'lunch' at 4pm. Hahaha.. After that,we went to take pics at the usual foto thingys.. During our 2nd pose.. Nana asked me to put on a serious pose. She had already put on hers and I was like laughing like mad cos i just couldnt put on a fake serious look!! I ended up laughing and she too! Cos my laughing is just too contagious. Had a crazy time with her inside the machine! God.. Then we made our way to Takashimaya. And.. we bought MUD PIES!! nono.. its chocolate pies.. Heavenly chocolate pies..! Taste damn gr8. We saw some performances outside Taka. This grp with lotsa diff drums.. And the ironic ting is that they were just promoting tea leaves frm Sri Lanka. Whats up with that? LoL. Nah~ Didnt see anyone familiar. Thats good.. LoL. It took my mind of him actually. But heck care,whatever. On the way home, which was realli early cos i had a planned dinner with my family, saw Ahmad who was making his way to school for a campfire. They wanted to gatecrash it.. As usual. Guess what? My family had dinner at Pattaya's Garden. Our usual family dinner place for Thai food. Damn.. I ate at Sakura for lunch and in just 4 hrs, im eating the same food. Not that Im complaining. Hehehe. I have to admit, Im born with a silver spoon in my mouth. =) Argh.. Couldnt eat much.. My stomach too bloated. Im gonna do my art folio later. Shld have started yesterday,but hurhur.. I got carried away.. I didnt do it at all. Fought with 'Awadh yesterday. Cos he bcame mad that i didnt sms him for&nbsp;43 days already. Haix.. U know,global sms now getting more expensive. How can i answer him that way? That would be downright rude. 'Awadh is Nana's cousin. Used to be frm my primary school but he moved to Malaysia when we were in primary 2 or 3. Yeah.. We sort of contact each other by e-mail or chatting every other weekend. He's a nice guy.. I cant deny that. When i told nana that he counted the number of days i didnt smsed him her reaction was like, " Itu sedara aku ker? " haha.. Nana, that i
