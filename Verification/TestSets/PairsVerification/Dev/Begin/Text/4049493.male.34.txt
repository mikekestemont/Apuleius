Wow what a disappointment...&nbsp; I just  knew  night #2 would offer a drunken enraged Kennedy, an unhinged  urlLink ARRRRGHHHH  Howard  urlLink ARRRRGGGHHHGHG  Dean, and some in your face remarks from Teresa Heinz that would be noteworthy...&nbsp;&nbsp; Sadly for me the combination of&nbsp;locking the liquor cabinet in Kennedy's room, the lithium for Dean, and the realization that Teresa's mouth could blow her husband's campaign, seemed to keep everyone in check.&nbsp; If  urlLink Dan Rather calls it a bore , then you know it must be a bore.&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been widely reported that the Democratic party is not really excited by Kerry, although they are united to remove Bush.&nbsp; I think that was very apparent last night.&nbsp;   &nbsp;  To be fair, due to some work I was doing, I ended up listening to the speeches, rather than watching, other than for Ted Kennedy (who looked surprisingly sober!), so it might have been MUCH more exciting on the TV.....&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't roll your eyes at me! I did say "might".   &nbsp;  Tonight was a lot of the same old same old, other than Barack Obama.&nbsp; I truly hope that his message and his approach becomes their party norm.&nbsp; He is the only speaker I listened to that didn't make me shutter, and didn't make me want to kick my dog.&nbsp;&nbsp; OK, I don't really&nbsp;have a dog.&nbsp; Regardless, he is obviously the Democrats' new golden child, and with good cause.&nbsp; He radiates charisma.&nbsp; He is not only black, but white too!&nbsp; With immigrant roots?&nbsp; Can this be?&nbsp; His message lacks the shrillness that is the defacto standard of the rest of the party, and it is obvious that we will be seeing more of him in future years, barring some scandal getting in his way.&nbsp; It would have to be a pretty damn big one though, considering that both an impeached adulterer and a drunken manslaughterer were at the podium prior to him.&nbsp;   &nbsp;  The award for most ironic message of the night must surely go to&nbsp;Kennedy.&nbsp;&nbsp;I absolutely couldn't believe his comments about&nbsp;how we used to live in a time were kings passed on their role to their sons without&nbsp;any regard to whether they had merited it.&nbsp; He compared Bush to a   monarch named George who inherited the crown  .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See  urlLink glass houses .&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course he continued a common theme that the Republican party is driven by division.&nbsp;   They know that we are weaker when we are divided   (poor paraphrasing).&nbsp; He spoke about how the Republican party pits blacks against whites, rich against poor, gays and against straights, and urban areas against super...sup...&nbsp; .... suburbs.&nbsp; I didn't think he was going to get that last one out.&nbsp; Damn teleprompters.   &nbsp;  Are the followers of the Democratic party so blind to see that it is their leaders who not only constantly point out these divisions, but base their whole stance on them?&nbsp;&nbsp; John Edwards has been touring the country with his "Two Americas" stump speech for months now.&nbsp; Can someone please get the memo to him that he might want to change that u
