this is one i wrote about chris when the whole thing with meg happened...  you hurt her so bad, you tore her whole world apart. when she first met you, she thought," heres a new start". but you didnt think. you just said "whatever". but the sad thing is, she thought youd be together forever. everyday and everynight, all she did was think of you, and just how happy she was. but because of you, her whole world turned upside down. that beautiful smile turned into a frown. those tears of joy, stopped falling, and new ones fell, but full of sadness. all the lies you told her, you probably thought,"oh she'll get over it". but its not that simple. shes not a little toy, one you cantoss around and play with whenever you want. shes a real person, she has feelings too. did you think of them? your real friends? the people who new the truth, but still stood behind you. i guess not. because if you had, you wouldnt have done it. you would have thought twice, about what you'd lose in the end.
ok so i was going through some things and i found this book i used to write in when i was mad.. or just bored. at the beginning i was mad at a friend because it was like they dropped off the edge of the earth and didnt call me anymore, write me, or even say hi when they visited. i remember one time, it was valentines day, and when i was walking home , i looked ahead and saw them with someone, and just kept walking home figuring theyd come by and hang out like usual. but no... they didnt, so that prolly had something to do with some of the poems... but  yea... ok so heres something i wrote... a few ppl have read it, but i think only 2..k well here it is... i hate the way you make me feel. i hate the way you make life seem so real. i hate the way you make me smile, and make the small things seem worthwhile. i hate the way you make me laugh,i hate the way it feels so right, i hate they way i want to love you, and at the same time want to hate you. i hate the way you make me cry, and always make me wonder "why?". i hate the wya i really hate you. i hate all teh lies that make me cry, and all the times i waited for you, when you never did show.i hate all teh dreams that will never come true, but most of all, i hate the way i cant hate you.
