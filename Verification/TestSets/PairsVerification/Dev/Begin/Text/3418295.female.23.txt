some of the people in my house are driving me crazy.  A. and D., to be specific.  A. is OBSESSED with the house being clean/organized.  ummm, hello.  if you like a clean and orderly house set up in the way you yourself would prefer, in the style to which your martha stewart ass is accustomed, do not move into an arts collective with 14 other people who have about a thousand better things to do than clean.  if your priority is a neatly organized space, do not move in with a bunch of artists who prioritize doing art, having space for art, and storing their art.  her talking about how she'd like to turn the metallurgy/woodworking workshop and tool storage space into a yoga room (because "that area is an entryway, after all, and all that stuff being there is just so cluttered and shitty and needs to be gotten rid of") was absolutely the last straw, i'm sorry.  this is not an episode of  Trading Spaces .  it is an arts collective.  we do art here.  art which requires a minor amount of clutter sometimes.  we are not going to get rid of a workshop because it is unsightly or because it happens to be located in an untraditional area of the house.  we are not going to get rid of valuable tools because you think of them as "clutter".  also, she completely reorganized the kitchen in a very inconvenient way.  when i moved some stuff back to where it was (because it made more sense that way), she got all snippy about it, as if i had just RUINED her precious kitchen.  grow the fuck up, man.  you want a kitchen designed to your specifications?  go get your own kitchen.     i mean, don't get me wrong.  i like a clean house just as much as the next girl.  it's very nice to have an aesthetically pleasing living space.  i'm generally pretty good about doing my chores.  i get fairly outraged when someone leaves dirty dishes in the sink all day, or hangs greasy pots back up on the rack to be cleaned by the next person, or flakes on an absolutely necessary chore.  however, i take all my pissiness about this with a grain of salt.  i know that if i want a clean house, i can move out anytime i want.  i know i'd much rather live with my poor and sloppy yet brilliant and passionate housemates than 14 soulless and bourgeois neatniks.  also, i am pissed at D. for similar reasons.  reason #1 being that he is constantly guilt tripping me about cleaning, even though i generally pull my weight in that department.  reason #2 being that he never gives anyone else shit about cleaning, even though clearly there are people around the house who do not pull their weight.  and when i call him on this, he inevitably says something like, "but you're so beautiful when you're angry..."  which is either because A) he does all this because he's attracted to me in the first p
