Just a short note.&nbsp; I didn't realise until Amanda told me that you were having to register with blogger in order to put comments about my posts.&nbsp; I have fixed that now and the general public (ie you, my friends and family) are now able to comment on my posts without having to register.&nbsp;&nbsp; So please feel free to make comments, give advice, tell me to shut the hell up or whatever.&nbsp; I look forward to hearing from you.
Aaaaaaaagggghhhhhhhhhh.&nbsp;&nbsp; I typed in a big long post and I lost it.&nbsp;   *Note to self* -: "Self, please remember to copy your post before you try and post it.&nbsp; Then you won't have to retype it all the time" :- *End of note to self* &nbsp;     Guess who just wasted 10 minutes checking to see if she had really lost that post.&nbsp; Yep its me, and guess what. I had.       &nbsp;   OK.&nbsp; Here we go again .    &nbsp;   &nbsp; Anyway.&nbsp; I didn't even have to go through two weeks feeling naked without an engagement rign on my finger.&nbsp; The excellent staff at Garden City Showcase Jewellers rang me 10 days after I ordered my wedding ring to let me know that it was ready.&nbsp; I was down there within an hour (surprise, surprise).  My wedding ring is absolutely gorgeous.&nbsp; It is made of 18ct gold (I am allergic to anything less pure) and is scalloped.&nbsp; It fits in perfectly with my engagement ring and the scalloping matches the ridges on the engagement ring where the diamonds sit.&nbsp; I am really surprised at how well it turned out as I had a lot of trouble visualising what it would look like from the drawing we saw.&nbsp; For the speedy service and the excellent craftsmanship this was money well spent.  I would recomment this jewellers to anyone in Perth who needs a custom-made ring.&nbsp; If you were to look at the rings together you would swear that they were made as a set.  The gift registry also took less than 2 weeks to get sorted once we had done all the horrible foot slogging around the shops.&nbsp; I took my list in, they entered it into the computer, making smaller items like cushions and ramekins into group gifts so that most gifts on our list are valued at around $30-$50.  We signed the stores copy of the list as soon as it was posted to us and took it in immediately (if I don't do things at once I tend to procrastinate and they never get done so it is important I act at the time).&nbsp; So our registry is now available at the information desk at Garden City for anyone who is interested.  We have announced our wedding date to most of the potential guests now.&nbsp; Well, Jim's mum has actually done an awful lot of the announcing for us. *grin*&nbsp; I told the footy club mob when Amanda and I were out for dinner with them last Friday and they all seem awfully excited.&nbsp; I just wish I could afford to invite e
