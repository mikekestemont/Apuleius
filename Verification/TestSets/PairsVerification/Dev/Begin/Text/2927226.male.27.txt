OK, so turning 27 was no big deal. What made the B-day a little more fun was having my housemate, Joe, celebrate his 26th just two days later (Thursday). Still, I think I'm gonna start a new tradition... I'm gonna start taking off work on my birthday so I can enjoy the day however  I  want -- whether it's sleep in 'til noon or assemble a scrapbook or drive to Philly for a cheesesteak.  In my mind, birthdays should be special in the way you want them to be.... if you want to work and ignore them, fine. But if you want to have the day to yourself, more power to you.
urlLink From the pages of the Delaware State News....   Uh, yeah. This is the fun stuff I get to write about.... seriously! How could you not laugh after reading this? I had a good chuckle with the state police spokesman, picturing some good ol' boy pulling up in front of the police station and walking inside and proclaiming, "I've got a car full of hand grenades. Who wants 'em?"   What a dummy. Who sits there and collects 32 hand grenades and then drives them to the police??? Um hello? 911, can I frickin' help you? Had one of the live grenades gone off and this guy had died, I'd have the winner for the 2004 Darwin Awards locked up already. But alas, this idiot probably went home and procreated.   Shit.
Welcome to my latest creation.... my very own Blog! I plan to post several musings on my favorite subjects -- baseball, music, wrestling and life in general -- as well as an account of my career as a reporter. Believe me, some interesting things happen in my office and on my beat.  And so,  on with the show!
Two words:  Dover Downs .  Those words mean nothing to you unless you: A) Like to lose money to one-armed bandits, or B) L-O-V-E NASCAR. The Downs is part casino, part hotel, part international speedway. Two major NASCAR races are hosted here each year, which draws 150,000 rednecks and thousands of RVs to Dover (and thus lowering the IQ of the state by 30 points) and rakes in about $95 million in revenue for associated businesses. While I HATE NASCAR with a passion, I have to respect the fact that I live in a town that actually has a guaranteed tourist draw outside of its history.  As for the casino, it's just video slots, but who knows? I might strike it rich someday! :-P Either way, Dover Downs is contributing to society (albeit by producing more broke, drunk rednecks, but you've gotta start somewhere).
urlLink A perfect example of why I can't live in a town right out of "Deliverance"   So, two candidates for Frederica Town Council are running for office with the understanding that if they are elected, they could nix the town's two-officer police force -- a violation of the town's charter. Great idea! Why don't we turn off the water and reinstitute a central well for the town? And bring back t
