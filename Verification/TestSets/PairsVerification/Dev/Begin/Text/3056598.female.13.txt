BREMEN    shUt uP my InNerjEsus  ---------------------------------  Has anyone read the comic Bremen. Awesome, it's japan thing but don't shut it out cause of that. It's more american independent kinda thing. It's about 4 guys starting a band to be gods of rock. One is this extremise who's going to find his dream. the other Reji has a huge red mowhawk and wants to be a musician he's bit over passinate about his dream and sensable but i love him anyway. 3rd is a crossdresser Ryo he/she is the drummer he's .... got problems ... but is really entertaining.last is ran the bass player. he's the oldest of the group and thought of the name Bremen for the band. He was in some drug cult thing. The whole comic was mostly molded around punk rock and give a vibe of Tank Girl ( movie not comic). If you look up Toriyama's world you'll go to manga and download the comic i genrally like it though it has it's flaws. If you hate it well then well ...fuck you.
