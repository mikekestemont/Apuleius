This recipe is from an old cookbook of my mothers that is now, sadly, lost. One time, while living far from home, I had a desire for this fudge and I had lost the recipe.  I called Mom and asked her to read the recipe to me over the phone.  I had made it many times so I really just needed the ingredients.  I made the fudge, there in my own kitchen far from home and it tasted just as good as it did at home.  1 c. sugar 1 c. brown sugar 3/4 c. milk 2 Tbs. light corn syrup 3 Tbs. butter 1/2 c. or more peanut butter 1 tsp vanilla  Mix sugars, milk, and corn syrup in a pan and cook until the soft ball stage. Add butter and peanut butter. Allow to cool. Add vanilla and beat until it looses it sheen. Pour into a butter pan and cool completely before cutting.

Dressing:  Beat 2 eggs 2 Tbs. flour 2 Tbs. sugar 1/4 c. vinegar 1 tsp. salt 1/4 tsp. pepper 2 tsp. prepared mustard (yellow) Blend, add 2 c. water Boil until thick Add 1 c. mayonaise (I like Hellmans)  5 lbs potatoes, boiled and cut in squares 3 stalks celery (or more--I like lots) 1 sm onion finely chopped 3 hard boiled eggs, chopped  Updated to answer questions in comments:  My mother used all purpose white potatoes but waxy potatoes like red skinned potatoes or Yellow Finn potatoes work really well. Boil 5 lbs of potates with their skins on until tender but not over cooked. Pour off water immediately and allow them to cool. Peel and cut into cubes (~1 cm  or 1/2 inch square). Add dressing and stir gently to coat.
