I just finished reading this book of short stories written by some of the famous Filipino authors in the league of NVM Gonzales, Manuel Quezon III, and several others. The book is entitled Chimera. It featured stories about societal trash that remain taboo for mealtime conversations. The stories are actually a common fare for a kid like me who grew up in the hustling life of a big city. Fast cars, deafening noise, police car sirens, traffic, smog. All these things that contribute to a miserable daily living that can be likened to a dirty wall repainted again and again by temporary chemicals to cover up a fa√ßade. But there is more to the dark avenues and the garbage-filled creeks. There are whispered voices that change the dampness of the city corners with bliss. It was perhaps these voices that awaken the sleeping ignorance of the people why these stories were written. And it was beautiful. These are stories worth telling for bedtime.   Story #1  A nameless man who lives a life detached from the usual tricks of conformity shares a wonderful childhood with a friend whom he is secretly attracted to. Time, as usual, got a bit cruel to their friendship. The woman fell in love with another man who happens to dislike the best friend. The woman had to move to a farther town to pursue college and that meant another detachment from him. They communicated through letters, all of which contained the world of a miserable man who is unable to find sunlight after that uneventful leaving of the woman.   (this blog to be continued)...
Paulo Coelho (Alchemist) says that "If you want something, all the universe conspires to help you achieve it."  Excuse me Pao dude, but I beg to disagree. No, not beg. I insist.  It's been a boring long day. All this waiting for something I don't even know. This has always been my problem everytime I'm not at work. I always answer to the same question again and again: how will I shorten the time of not doing something? I have a compulsion that's hard to deal with. I cannot just sit there, smell the misty breeze of rainy June and  follow the sun.  I just can't do that. I am often advised by my friends to try to relax and take things easy.   Anyway. That line from Coelho just struck me when I realized how much wanting have been unanswered. I don't sulk as much though because I think it's a total waste of time. And now that I'm in the middle of having a grand time writing down my thoughts, I just got a message that I'll be picked up and head home. Fuck it.
This movie is really good. I now have a sudden craving for violence, and blood and revenge. It's probably because I also want revenge. I want to murder someone who deserves to be dead.
