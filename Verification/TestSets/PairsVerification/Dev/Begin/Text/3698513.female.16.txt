woot woot. i had soooo much of a better day! so yesterday me jana and rachel were supposed to go shopping. but being the cool person i am, 2 other people called and asked if i wanted to go with them, so i bailed on the other 2, and went with erica. i'm sooo nice. me and erica had a blast. haha. we just drove around got slurpees, and bathing suit shopped. even though i know i dont have the best body in the world, i bought my first 2 piece swimming suit!! i'm so happy. i love it!! it's pink, and white polka dots, and a huge roxy sign on it. muahahaha. so then i had to go home, and then i remembered that sara was leaving me for a week and a half. i raced over to her house, and we hung out for a while then allen and this kid named.... josh... i think that's him, but he came over and we all hung out for a long time. but it was fun. everyone was passing eachother out, on purpose. i got scared. they tried to do it to me, and i was like ummm no?! thanks anyways. but i told them i'm going to do it when i'm high, cause when i'm high, i do anything. but little do they know, i dont smoke anymore. muahahaha. i feel so cool. but i must call someone to hang out with now that i'm awesomly popular, and have so many things to do now that i'm ungrounded. woot woot. i'm excited. i need to go tanning too bad it's not bright out. more to come. dun dun dunnnnnn.
