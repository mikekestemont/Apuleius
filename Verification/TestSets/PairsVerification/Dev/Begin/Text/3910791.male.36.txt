&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was only one word that came to mind when I sniffed her panties--familiar. It was especially odd because four hours ago we didn’t exist to each other. But the perfume was definitely a room I’d been in before.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tracy was this delightful lady I met downtown at this spot called The Basement, a dancehall in the basement of an abandoned church, not that far from the Capitol Building in D.C.  &nbsp; Washington was truly a tale of two cities-there was the mall and the Air and Space Museum and all that, but go about ten blocks in any direction and it was a totally different town-with faces, and dirt and violence and desperation.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was in the toilet pissing and she bounded in the men’s room and threw up in the stall next to me.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was wearing a tight pink lame skirt, and when she knealt before the porcelain god, the skirt split straight up the back and exposed the white satin of her panties. The contrast of her mocha-like skin and the shiny material caught my attention. I was a sucker for a damsel in distress.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were four other dudes in the bathroom laughing and trying to stay out of her line of fire. I rushed into the stall and locked it behind me.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Wh-who the fuck are you?” she said, barely lifting her head from the toilet. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I’m the one that’s going to get you out of here.”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She stood, then closed the lid and sat on it. She was still attractive, even though she had just puked and was sweating like a horse.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “What predicament?” she said, holding her head in her hands. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Well, you’re throwing up in the men’s room of a packed nightclub with a dramatically torn skirt. Sounds like a problem to me.” I handed her my handkerchief.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “How do I know you’re not a psycho pervert?”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I’m a musician.”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I don’t feel any better.”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone pounded hard on the stall door behind me.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Hey, you two break it up in there!”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Just a fuckin’ second!” I shouted back.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a pause. “Okay jackoff, you’re second is up.”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I took my jacket off and handed it to her. She put it on and snatched the remains of her skirt off and threw it in the unflushed toilet. She tied her black blouse to her waist.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “You’re not too shy are you?”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I’m standing in a men’s room in my underwear. Does that sound shy to you? My name’s Tracy, by the way. Just in case anyone asks.”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “My name’s Myron X. Nobody should ask though.”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I unlocked the door and this bouncer the size of a Hollywood billboard with no neck and a NASA-like headset on stood there with a superior look on his face.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “My girlfriend was sick. Her name’s Tracy.”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Then you better take Tracy home. Now.”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He escorted us to the d
