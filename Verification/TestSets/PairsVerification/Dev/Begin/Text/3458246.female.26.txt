My work day so far... I have shown the work that I did the night before to my neighboring colleague Petra, began to do some work on some graphical results I generated the day before I am distracted by the idea of writing a blog.   In the corner of the office, we have Mark P replacing most of the components in of the laser printer and thinking it would be cheaper to buy a brand new printer.    Sitting quietly is Mark E doing some seriously evil looking maths equation.  Ant turns up a few minutes later (around about 10.30 am) with the comment "You must all love coming in early for work!"  Ant hangs around for a few minutes before rushing off to a meeting announcing "Right, I am off to save the world..."  Juan arrives next with a loaf of bread and a tin opener.  He has just been to Hamburg and has brought the office back a present of a party sized tin of German sausages, salami and meat paste.  He sits down and tells his cohorts in supervision about yesterdays encounter with the supervisor that the two Marks missed as they went home early.  The rest of the office filters in eventually and as they discuss how they are going to heat up the sausages with what we have to hand,  I slip on my headphones to drown out the noise of the office...
I can see the world around me as a soap.  At any one time there are various things happening - no single day is the same.  There is always something happening and I have my trusty PDA with which I can write my thoughts for the day to be uploaded to my blog when I have time.  I work in an office mainly with a group of men.  We are all doing PhDs in biomedical engineering with a few other students thrown in.  At its fullest capacity and the time of speaking, we have 15 people in the office, but only 14 desks - go figure.  How shall I describe my working environment?   Let me begin by describing the people that I work with:  Ant has an accent that you can instantly identify with Newcastle.  He is our resident Geordie with a heart of gold and often regales us with his adventures with his 1980 blue Mini.   D is our whiz kid boy from India, and in his short time since arriving in the UK, he has developed a taste for R&B music, clubbing and chillin'.  Juan is our man with a cosmopolitan background.  Spanish by birth brought up in Belgium and studied at university in the UK.  He speaks six languages as well as lots of computer programming languages.  He is highly intelligent and currently working on the philosophy of 'Social Punishment'.  Mark E joined our office at the same time as Juan and he is a friendly chap working on something to do with treadmills.  If we are not careful, we might be put o
