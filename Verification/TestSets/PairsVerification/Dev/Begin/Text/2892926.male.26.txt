Well Nero Sun's gig was a very good time and the band sounded great. Although I do have an issue with the teasing of Highway to Hell and Back in Black. Don't start it if you ain't gonna finish it Wags. You know you can pull off Bon or Brian for one or two songs. If you missed the show last night-they'll be at Wicks on Friday, so show up and watch them jam.  On another band note, Hewett's band will be playing this Thursday at Gerstles in St Matthews. I believe the start time is 10 pm. So if you can take of Friday and that way you can see 2 shows on 2 nights.  I look forward to the partying.  Hope everyone is enjoying the weather, as I am stuck at work.
It has been brought to my attention as to where I am getting my phrase "Trump Tight"?  My brother was the first person I ever heard use, so I assume he invented it.  I know a lot of people who use the word "tight" when something good happens. Therefore, when something is Trump Tight, it is very good, excellent, or awesome.

As for me purchasing the Paris shirt there are a couple of reasons. First, I will buy other shirts if that one seems to be made well and the company is legit. Second, I think it is funny as hell. Third, I don't like Paris and I hope she breaks her leg or something so that the dumb, skinny bitch gets some karma back for all the shit she pulls.  Remember that  Nero Sun plays at The Hideaway at 10 pm tonight . So I hope to see some of yall there for a good time.
Well no one responded, which is good, since I owe no one a round  tomorrow night at the Nero Sun show starting at 10 pm at The Hideaway.    Answers  1) "Kickstart My Heart" by Motley Crue 2) "Captive Honour" by Megadeth 3) "Highway to Hell" by AC/DC 4) "Talk Dirty to Me" by Poison 5) "Back in the Saddle" by Aerosmith  As Jesse Ventura said in Predator "Nothing but a bunch of God damn slack jawed faggots"  Someone needs to grow a pair and answer next time-those were easy.  Everyone have a good weekend. I am going to start closing up shop now.
I say no problem to Wags or Hewett or anyone else I know for that matter, that is doing something that I can't, play music well in front of a group of strangers. I also say support our local music scene, because it helps our friends get more exposure from both local and national reps. It's always good hanging out get some grub, maybe some drinks, and watch your friends on stage singing some good songs. Plus if any of our friends get famous, more o
