Sonnet XXVII   clamped in a tough metropolis  ahead with ease over suburbia  the sun quotes hot flashes  over oceans and lakes  trees and the north wind, nature  calls for the baptism of your  soul, attached to metal's grip  a use of vices, metamorphosis  iron butterflies in concrete jungles  a little rock speaks of landslides  exaggeration of such a young child  run wild in the wilderness  run naked in your life  mother nature is calling for your baptism.
Gabriel's Trumpet    for Gabriel Garcia Marquez   In the end all he will have is a corpse  and some poems stuffed in his ribcages
Frailty    truth be told  I am not  the most courageous of voices   I tremble when I speak  and I shake when I breathe  I close my eyes  and hope not to embarrass myself  when it's my turn to say something  I watch everyone when it's their moment  and how they use it  some waste it on something frivolous  others use it to actually let people  hear their voices   I do both   I ramble, I stutter, I vomit,  I freeze, I miss lines, I forget to bow  and I always stumble on the punch line  but I also try to open, inspire, give hope  to crack a smile, a giggle  and I always try to give a hundred percent  but I sometimes fall short at ninety-nine  and leave that remaining one percent for you  so that you can give me something to hold on to,  to show me that I'm not alone  when it's my turn and that you understand  I am not the most courageous of voices  but you loved the fact that  I tried
SO, Finally  my book Pelo Bueno is finished it will be out in August on DARK SOULS PRESS finally it's only taken 7 years to finish  keep reading to find out
HAPPY NEW YEAR PELO BUENO IS PUBLISHED  AND PEOPLE ACTUALLY ARE BUYING IT J
