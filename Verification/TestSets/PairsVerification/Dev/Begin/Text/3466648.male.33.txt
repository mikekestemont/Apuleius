urlLink    Ralph Bakshi Wizards More than words can say.
Hi, I watched a great flick last night a animated movie called Wizards. The movie was made by Ralph Bakshi who also made Heavy Metal,American Pop, & Fritz the Cat. What an amazing movie the Earth has been destroyed by terrorists with a nucler blast. Up from the ashes the Earth is reborn with Elves,Wizards,Orges,Goblins & Faires. This story is a battle of two brothers one good (Avatar) one evil (Blackwolf). The animation is beautiful and images of World War 2 are used in the background for an amazing affect during the war scenes. I highly recommend this imaginative thought provoking film. I also continued watching Smallville S2 6 more shows to go and I can't wait to see the season ending episode. My Doctor's Prescriptions for today is a cool program if you want to be able to recieve your Yahoo e-mail through Outlook Express,Outlook,Thunderbird, & other e-mail clients. The program you need is   urlLink YahooPops    enjoy.   Have A Good Nights Sleep!

Hey everyone well today   urlLink G4Techtv.com    makes its debut. No more Techtv.com everyone who was on the techtv fourm has been transplanted to the G4 fourms.This really angers me since the forum is really poorly run and has no structure. I also had problems getting around on there webpage and the site would not connect to certain links. I hope this does not represent how G4 will be running there product so far I am very unimpressed. Well I continued to watch the rest of Smallville season 2 only 8 more shows to go and  WOW . I can't get over all the twists and turns this show puts its viewers through. Excellent work! I am trying to put up a Free File (a tip of the hat to techtv) of the day which I will be calling my Doctor's Prescriptions for PC users. I started yesterday with Bookmark Bridge. Todays prescription is a pretty cool program. Have you ever been on the net looking for pictures, and when you finally have found what you wanted there just were to many pictures for you to download from a site (who wants to sit there right clicking each pic). Well   urlLink Quadsucker    is the program that will work for you. What it does is the program will prompt you for the web address of the site you want to suck the pictures off of. After you give it the Url the program will do all the work for you. Check it out.   Have A Great Evening!
