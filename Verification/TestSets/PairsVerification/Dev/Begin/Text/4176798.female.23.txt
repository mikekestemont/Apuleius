It is a proven fact : i cannot stay in the same place for more than a few hours without loosing my mind. im not joking either.ive been home for 2 days and im already depressed. the house is a mess, the dishes are piled up in the sink, and instead of taking care of all that im sitting here in front of my computer typing a letter to nobody bitching about my life,,,,,,,,, makes a whole lot of gaddam sense, right?it seems to me that i get like this whenever scott has to work and im left here with the kids. it wouldnt be so bad if he wasnt working nights. i hate sleeping alone. and because im working on his off days i really dont ever see him and it makes me feel so lonely.geez i guess i dont have much to say now...................................
so it has been one long day... my daughter has been sick and in one of those moods where she wants to be held all day. so of corse nothing got done as far as housework or anything else for that matter. although i did make an appointment with my dermatologist for monday. ive got a place on my shoulder that has come up and im pretty sure its a skin cancer. so im gonna get that sucker removed mui el pronto.If i havent mentioned this befor. im a diabetic and have some serious kidney problems. my doctor says if i can loose alot of weight the kidneys may heal themselves and i wont need a transplant. ive been threatened with diyalisis many times but i know once it starts i won heal at all and i might aswell just give up.i like to have some kinda hope.ive been dealing with myself stuffing my face almost compulsively lately.i dont know why. its period week and i tend to munch alot then and i started back working this week too more satress but i definately needed to get out of the house. i am sooooooo not a stay at home mom. i love my babies, i really do, but domestic goddes just isnt in the cards for me.i need to be around other adults and talk about things other than sesame street  and peanut butter sandwiches. i didnt even mind the 12 hour shifts!id go in first thing in the morning bright eyed and all fresh feeling. with my huge 24 once raspberry mocha coffe feelin glorious.i am so totally back on the caffine bandwagon.. when i first started having kidney problems i quit drinking caffine and pretty much anything that wasnt watter... but now its a must have if im going to work.im worried im going to start gaining weight again though. i lost like 30 pounds a month ago but have been even for a while.not gainng but havent been making an effort to loose really either.i need to. of corse i need several things....... but that is for another time.....................
so scott and i went through this period where we never NEVER had sex.EVER. t
