He posted a new picture today. In it he’s wearing his favorite (awful) yellow jacket, with his favorite (awful) somewhat matching tie, and his (only) nice pair of black pants. He looks like a pretentious (yes) hipster (not). In the other picture he’s standing next to his (former) motorcycle in his leather jacket (trying too hard to look alpha).   He loves word games. He thinks it’s clever to be able to decipher the mathematical equation or meaning behind a group of letters. To him it’s a mark of intelligence. He considers himself an intellectual (jackass). He is extremely articulate. He thinks his PhD entitles him to all of his (superficial) desires. He does not understand the value of hard work outside of academia. He has never seen outside of his (very small) box.  He has a deep voice and a dominant personality. He likes to be in control. He likes to be mysterious. He’s self-absorbed and self-indulgent. He rarely, if ever, thinks of other people. Unless (of course) he gains something from thinking of said other person. He is a monster in bed and a phenomenal kisser. He’s only kinda cute until you get him naked. Then he’s gorgeous.    He calls himself fearless and he probably believes it. He thinks emotions are a waste of time. He looks down on the act of feeling as weakness. He is (overly) rational and (always) logical. Everything has to fit into his plan.   (I didn’t.)

He was my North, my South, my East and West, My working week and my Sunday rest, My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song; I thought that love would last for ever: I was wrong.  The stars are not wanted now; put out every one: Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun; Pour away the ocean and sweep up the woods: For nothing now can ever come to any good.  W.H.Auden XX ~ The Collected Poetry of W. H. Auden 1945
Noise. Loud music. Flashing images from the television. Pulsing floors resulting from the surround sound maxed out. I think best this way. If I turn it off the rest of me goes into full throttle, blocking out my inner voice. With the noise my voice comes out clearly, distinctly, separate from the rest of the chaos. With the noise I don’t have to create the chaos – it’s already there.  Five of us sit in a circle playing board games. It’s Tuesday – we do this every Tuesday. The game changes but the names stay the same. This week it’s Taboo, next week Pictionary. I like any of the games that are word games. I’m good at word games and letter manipulations. I
