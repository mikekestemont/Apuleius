I'm so proud, last night i created a door cover from a white bit of material and a black poster pen. Cos i have a glass window in my bedroom door, you can look through and see things you're not suppose to.   So now i have a door cover that has a black lattice work and a chinese proverb on it. Plus, john's and my names in chinese characters.  OOH OOH. I'm so proud, it actually looks quite good.
My new love is battlefield 1942, i get to run around shooting people while the com or the other players actually so all the stuff to win the battle. Apart from the stupid tanks on Wake Island, they were just lining up one behind the other and it seemed no matter how many i killed there were always more.  yeah yeah that's it...
No idea what i'm doing. Was just trying to write a comment on my friend's page, and i had to go through this shit. Oh well.
Disappointed to hear that the summer epic of King Arthur had been hacked to pieces by reviewers, I have decided to write my own. Let me clarify, this is not a rebuttal as I have not read any of the reviews (I never agree with them). This is just an expression of  my own opinion.

Even the ‘love-triangle’ between Arthur, Lancelot and Guinevere is there. Why would someone die for a person if they did not love them?  The acting, though not spectacular, was certainly not wooden as certain reviewers have described. Today’s audiences and reviewers have been hurt by the over-acting in recent years. Where actors have strained their voices and elaborated gestures to bring that tear to the eye of the watcher. Clive Owen gave a believable performance, portraying the combination of aloofness and camaraderie between Arthur and his knights outstandingly. Arthur as the Roman Commander had to maintain a certain amount of detachment, yet these knights are his only companions on this remote isle. I must admit there were points where Owen seemed to slip into the monologues of theatre. Nonetheless, it was an impressive performance.  The boyish banter between the knights was magnificently written and executed. Conversations that are still witness within modern day circles of male friends. Even, Keira Knightley, who every word out of her mouth in the trailers made me cringe, pulled it all together in the m
