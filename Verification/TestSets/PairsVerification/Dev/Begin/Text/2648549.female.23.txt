I was just wondering what if  urlLink Friendster  had another feature called "chatster". In this case, any chatting-oriented programs would be at stake. By then, the guys at  urlLink Friendster  would have probably thought of creating online games. And personal websites or blogging tools (instead of just the cliché profile). And your own  urlLink Friendster  mailbox (by the way, instead of waiting for a notification in my mailbox, I'm going directly to my  urlLink Friendster  account to see if my network is expanding).  Later, an online currency (so you could buy, sell, or auction stuff while doing the routine hi-may-I-add-you-to-my-friends-list activity).  Then, an extensive user search is likely to follow (consider keywords related to "most time spent chatting", "website-award winning", "most selling items", or even "Fraudster").  With all that, we might say, "Now, who needs the Internet anymore?" Glad is not about to happen anytime soon.  I am actually waiting for the time it does not have "beta" tagging along, but "We regret to inform you that  urlLink Friendster  is no longer operating due to lack of financial support" on the screen (to make it less cynical, try this: " urlLink Friendster  is now teaming up  urlLink Yahoo!  and all free accounts will be limited to 200KB of images and 200 friends. Click here to register for a Premium Account.").  But before  urlLink Friendster  is history, I think I would just loosen up, relate to some stunning celebrities (who somehow manage to create an account despite their jam-packed schedule), and have testimonials done by cartoon characters.   [A  urlLink Friendster  user who finds delayed updates of  urlLink Friendster  is perfectly aggravating.]
Recently, some of my fellow mailing list administrators asked a mind-boggling question (no way, I'm just exaggerating this): "Why is everyone so quiet?" Or something like: "Where are you guys? What on earth have got you occupied?" Even the desperate one: "Look at the archives...I am the only person who does the posting."  I would say, blame it on  urlLink Friendster . With the six-degree-separation theory, now those virtual-people-person are turned more to adding up their friends list, uploading and changing pictures, submitting testimonials, and of course, the favorite approving things (I bet they never reject anything unless it blatantly hurts their cyber pride). With all the privileges, who needs a mailing list anymore? I mean, that dull, no-picture, full-of-forwardings, stack of emails (don't forget the annoying attachments)?  It seems that  urlLink Friendster  has all it takes to be the heaven of I-need-some-more-guys-to-be-linked-to kind of people. Taken  urlLink FIRO theory  into consideration,  urlLink Friendster  fulfills our interpersonal needs of inclusion—the feeling of being important, accepted, wanted. It also satisfies the human need of control by giving the right to decide which one they want to be associated with of all the users. And it surely gives a way of p
