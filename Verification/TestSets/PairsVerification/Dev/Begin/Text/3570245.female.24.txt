Some things are just worth waiting for. You can't put your finger on why exactly, but you know they are. They are just like ice cream. You have this intense craving for ice cream, and no matter what else you get, if it isnt the ice cream you feel slightly empty. lol. i am not the most patient person but when i find something or someone i want i go after it, and if i have to wait I do. NO matter how much it kills me. the best things in life are worth waiting for:)
My philosophy is that we each have little aliens that control our speech, our actions, and what our bodies do. Why??? Because with most, it seems that very few of us have control over those things ourselves. We usually say the wrong things, do the wrong things, and our bodies are just lumps that do what they want. it is soooo frustrating isn't it?

In these futile days of hopeless attitudes, beaten dreams, and greedy hearts, in these days when no one asks why and just goes with whatever, in order to save time or save effort, I feel lost. I feel misplaced. Why? Because I refuse to believe this is as good as it is going to get. That this is as good as i will get, or my life as a whole, or this world as a whole. I refuse to believe that my actions or presense here has no effect on anything or anyone around me because I am not everything I had once thought I would be. There is a darkness around us now. A haze that has trapped us in this pudding like pool of hopelessness and defeat. People settle for the easiest choices. Once more I will state this...EASY IS NOT ALWAYS BETTER!!!!! So what if I am the living definition of overly sensitive and emotional. I feel things others don't seem to. I see that person sitting at their desk, thinking no one n
