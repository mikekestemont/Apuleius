Unusual occurrence: there was a thread on  urlLink OUTintheUK  this morning which made me think. Someone was asking if, assuming it was possible to do a Dorian Gray-esque manoeuvre and have your own portrait grow old and so on instead of you, would you do it?  My initial reaction was that I'd love to, but I'd need could fix various things first (and boy is there a list). After I'd thought about it for a bit, though, I realised this was bollocks. The whole idea of freezing your appearance in this way hinges on an idea that you have reached a state of perfection you don't want to move on from.   First problem is that since there has never really been a time when I've been happy with the way I look, the chances of ever thinking it's perfect at any point in future are pretty remote really.   The second point - and a faintly contradictory one at that - is that I have a sneaking suspicion that I'm probably growing into my body quite well as I get older. Now I can't be totally happy about the thinning hair, but having it really short apparently takes years off me anyway, so it seems a handy coincidence that I now need to. Equally the crows' feet are less scary to have than I'd thought they would be and (if I'm in a good mood) kind of suit and so on and so on. Freezing your appearance at any point may prevent degeneration, but improvement ain't gonna happen either and what if that happens naturally?  Thing is, my opinions change anyway, so what I don't like now may change in future. For example I've realised that the one thing to cause me unimaginable trauma at school is now somewhat of an asset. Okay, so the ears are still bloody great big satellite dishes, but they work damn well and my ability to flap them is a great icebreaker at parties (if I time it right I can make people dispense drink from their noses). And if this whole aging process does leave me in a position of being vaguely boffable then at least they'll provide a useful service in holding my ankles in place.  So sod it. It may not be perfect but I may as well get comfy with it, keep it working and see where it all goes. All is flux, after all, but generally I think things have a habit of working out for the best.
I'm back down in Canterbury for the weekend and I'm not convinced it's changing for the better. The Whitefriars development is like a smaller but more soulless Lakeside, the chav pubs out down Sturry have closed (meaning the local gay bar has to have a direct line to the police in case of trouble now the scum come back into town) and it seems even more strewn with tourists than it used to be.  On the plus side, the new family cat is lovely; certainly annoying and attention-seeking enough to be a Morris a
