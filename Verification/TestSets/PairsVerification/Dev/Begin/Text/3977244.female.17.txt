I just got home from youth group. We had a very interesting discussion.      We were talking about repentance etc and i asked the question if a christian committed suicide would they be forgiven?&nbsp;Because they can't repent coz they are dead and it is a sin to kill yourself.        &nbsp;    Many people had different opinions, Colin, Matt and Austin all had their say and it was kind of helpful but i still didn't really get a clear answer (if anyone has an opinion feel free to tell me).        &nbsp;    We came to the conclusion somewhere along the line that yes we will be forgiven as we were wiped clean of sin when we chose to follow God BUT i was told that when you sin you should repent even though that is really only a physical way to acknowledge that you are sorry and its what is in your heart that really counts. (did i just make sense? makes sense to me)        &nbsp;    So really i still don't know, and another question was if you had just sinned and had not repented and then died by like getting hit by a bus or whatever would you go to Heaven?      yeah so right now i am just like so totally confuzzled and actually quite surprised i asked a question in the first place- i usually just sit there and listen, everyone else knows what they are talking about and know the answers and yeah so&nbsp;i usually feel left out. But i guess thats ok, I will survive.        &nbsp;    "In his great mercy he has given us a new birth, into a living hope, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead" - 1 Peter 1:3        &nbsp;    Later days.
OK for once it's not about me. I'm worried about a friend. Not mentioning any names but&nbsp;their behaviour is becoming really weird.      I can't say much in fear of their identity being found out by someone else reading this but yeah. I just hope they get better and soon, i really need them.      later days
Ok, now i'm in trouble.     My mother saw my arms, then started asking questions like, "you're not going through that f*cking stupid mutilation phase are you?"     How are you meant to answer that? Oh yeah, i love to slice and dice.       &nbsp;   I don't know how many people have read this, i've had about 4 replies and so far they have been pretty good.       &nbsp;   Had coffee with Trish today, it was good. We went shopping and she was asking me for advice about her and Geoff. Don't know how i was mean tto help but somehow i managed to, yay go me.       &nbsp;   My cousin gave me a Metallica and Guns 'n' Roses tour shirts today. Like wow! So happy!       &nbsp;    PSALM 147:3- he heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.      I love that verse right now.       &nbsp;   Later Days.
Anyways, been thinking for a little while now. I have an assessment due tomorrow (hence the thinking) but that's not what i was thinking about anyway.     I've been studying s
