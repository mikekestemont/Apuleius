Mrs Rasmussen was off on holiday today, and she and I enjoyed the fine weather by doing little else than reading in the garden. Tonight we had a barbecue, but the weather deteriorated somewhat and we had to evacute as it started raining. It didn't really amount to much rain, just darkish, threathening clouds. Then Matthias beat me in Pro Evolution Soccer with a beautiful header on a Beckham corner.
It's Saturday morning and Mrs Rasmussen is off from work until  Thursday next week on her Mid Term holiday. After a rather glorious  week, it's been raining all morning and everything outside is soaking  wet, including the batch of washing I hung out late last night when  the weather was really nice and warm. Matthias is cleaning his room, and he plans to watch The Fellowship  of the Ring later, which he thinks is very suitable for the weather.  Sofie is still asleep in her room as we speak. I am going into the city centre today to meet a bunch of roleplayers  I found via a website. They meet every Saturday in a book shop in  George Street, and then venture on to play at a coffee shop in Rose  Street. I am hoping to find a couple of roleplayers willing to play  during the week, as I have not played for more than two years.
How very convenient indeed. This is a feature I could quickly get  dependent on. In the other blog system I used, you had to log on to a  secure site and click 1 million times before your post was online.  This is great, and if this actually appears on the blog, it's working.
We haven't moved, but our blog has. Due to a change of service provider, we are now safely hosted at Blogger.com, at least for the moment.
How could I forget to mention it? Last Friday was my last day at uni as a student. I had my Media Law exam last Thursday and then wrapped up another module on Friday, and then, out in the sunshine. I've been in this situation before, but I guess you can never get used to it. It's a mixture of wild joy and crazy angst. What to do now? My gut reaction was to apply for any job anywhere in the UK I thought I could do. But then, I calmed down and thought about my own business. About the dream of being self-employed. You own boss. I still have it. So, there we go, at this point of writing I am officially self-employed. I have a client who needs his website and other things done by the end of June, but after that? No idea whatsoever.

...you people wouldn't believe. Not far from where we live lies the small Rosslyn (Roslin) Chapel, and castle ruins, a chapel built by the Knights Templars in 1446 on an ancient Mithraic temple site. I'll say that again: built by the Knights Templars in 1446. The chapel also features in Dan Browns conspiracy thriller The Da Vinci Code. T
