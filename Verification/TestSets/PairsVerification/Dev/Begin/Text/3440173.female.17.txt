Well the one thing I was worried about the most is over. The cheerleading competition which was yesterday and we came in 2nd. I'm so happy. All our hard work payed off! The gurls from one of the teams was so nice!  Anyways I always have a date for prom! It's my friend Sefton and I couldn't have picked anything better to go with. He's such a nice and fun and loving guy. But we are just going as friends lol just to let anyone who reads this know lol. So now all I need to get are my shoes and I'm ready for prom which is next week! I'm so excited. It's going to be the best night of my life.  Nothing to exciting went on today. Went shopping and got some new clothes and all that. But I did see this guy I was like in love with the other day. Let me tell you he still looks just the way I remember him. So anyways now I have to go and do some TR so I can have one more thing off my mind! Chow  P.S Caleb there will be something about you in here next time promise! lol.....laaaaates ;)
Well I just made one of these things up because I wanted to put a simple comment on one of my friends post thingy's. But I guess now I'll just use this as my writing online journal.

He always seems to amaze me and always shocks me with the things he says. But I guess thats what you get when you only talk to someone over the Internet and don't live everyday life with them and hang out with them. He always makes me thinks tho. With everything he says. It's amazing cause alot of people don't make me do that and he's one of those people who can just do that! So be happy Caleb cause this entry has been mostly about you.   It's also very amazing how you can feel so close with someone by just talking to them over the Internet. I mean I go with all my problems to him and he always seems to listen and make me feel better. I think that it's about time I take a road trip and go and see him! lol...He's a totally amazing person and we have alot in common. It's weird very weird trusting in someone you've never met before. I even feel closer to him then I did to his friend. But ohh well whatever. Anyways Caleb lol enough about you and how great you are. I don't want you to become so into yourself and thinking your the greatest thing alive lol.   I haven't been doing much this Monday morning. Just reading Caleb's entries and catching up on his life. I have been so busy I haven't been a
