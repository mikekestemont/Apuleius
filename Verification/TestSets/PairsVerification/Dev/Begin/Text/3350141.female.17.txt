so today was wednesday, which means we're half way through the week. i had tech 1st block (icky) and we had this really mean sub and had to watch this stupid movie about drag racing while filling out this chart. and me and ashley were done with the chart so we were drawing pictures for each other and the sub came over and started yelling at us to do our charts. which we already did! so the sub was like "well i can see you spent more time on your little drawings than on the actual work." and i was like "well screw you guye i'm going home!" (not really, but i wanted to)  then later i had french. in lunch kristen told me to call mrs.lux meemee lux( cause the french abreviatin for mrs is mme) so i did. and lux was like " you know i thought you were a more a mature than to call me that." and of corse in about to piss my pants cause i'm laughing so hard! then lux was glaring at me the rest of class. IT WAS GREAT!!!  "I'll Take The Rain"  The rain came down The rain came down The rain came down on me.  The wind blew strong The summer song Fades to memory  I knew you when I loved you then The summer's young and helpless.  You laid me bare You marked me there The promises we made.  I used to think As birds take wing They sing through life so why can't we? You cling to this You claim the best If this is what you're offering I'll take the rain I'll take the rain I'll take the rain.  The nighttime creases Summer schemes And stretches out to stay. The sun shines down You came around You love easy days.  But now the sun, The winter's come. I wanted just to say That if I hold I'd hope you'd fold Open up inside, inside of me.  I used to think As birds take wing They sing through life so why can't we? You cling to this You claim the best If this is what you're offering I'll take the rain I'll take the rain I'll take the rain.  This winter song I'll sing along I've searched its still refrain I'll walk alone I've given this, take wing Celebrate the rain.  I used to think As birds take wing They sing through life so why can't we? You cling to this You claim the best If this is what you're offering I'll take the rain I'll take the rain I'll take the rain   so thats all for today. hope your week sucks!                                            MEH  p.s. i totally got a 98 on that science test. take that ms benfante!
