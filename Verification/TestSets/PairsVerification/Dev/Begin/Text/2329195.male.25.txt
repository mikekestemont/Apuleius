Update 1: 12:09:58 PM  Heard a voice mail left on my HP when i woke up yesterday morning. Total left me disgusted and make me lost all my respect to that person. I can't say what actually happen but it definitely spoils my day and many more to come. I will not disclose what i heard but don't think i can ever forgive him for saying what he did. One has to account for whatever come out of his/her mouth. I'm lost. Like a wreakage flooding in the ocean. I don't know how i can handle this issue. One thing i do know... I have to be strong...  Being the eldest of my siblings... responsibilities really weights me down... if only i can put everything aside and just leave...   Update 2: 11:28:32 PM  Had my appraisal done this afternoon. The whole session lasted 2 whole hours. Can you believe it? Anyway, it was a very stressful session. I'm told by my superiors how they thought i fared this year, their expectation of myself next year. Not forgetting their "lecturing". I came out of the room having a splitting headache. Even now as i'm typing this blog, my head is still spinning. Guess i'm too stressed up. Gosh, i really need to unwind. Can't wait for weekends to be here so that i can go for a drink. :P     postCount('20031126');

Picked up Ivan and his gf (Seendly) along the way. Order three bowls of minced pork porridge, one plate of ten chicken wings, one plate of carrot cake and 10 sticks of O-TAR. End of the night. Think i gain another kg.  :|   Sunday Danny came with Ivan to pick me up at 3.30pm and we make our way down to Bugis. We did some window shopping. Call me sua ku or what. But i've just realised that there is a small arcade at the childrens section of the shopping mall that carters to kids and their parents. Children can play there without fear of being chased out. Cool. Took a break to rest our feet at Terra. A restaurant/cafe that we always hang out at. Ordered 3 cups of drinks and spend the afternoon chatting. part of the conversation is about gals that walk pass. eg, that gal's hair nice, that skirt very short, nice legs. haha. Saw one of our ex-superior in NS and got to know that he just came back from an attachment to East Timor. Glad that he is back safely. Dinner was very good. We had steamboat buffet at one of the restaurant along the rows of shophouses being Parco Bugis. There are s
