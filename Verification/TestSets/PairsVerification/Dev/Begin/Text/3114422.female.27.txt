Let's get set to knit ornaments! AND of course share photos of completed ornaments and the pattern info.  This isn't so much about X-mas - it's about CUTE tiny knitted things. I think it will be fun to make a garland of knitted tinies that are for year round, not December.  Let me know if you want to join up and I will send you the info.   urlLink Here is what I am going to start with.   Weekend Knits also has really cute teeny tiny sweaters.  More patterns can be found at:  urlLink About.com
This tiny sweater turned out great - from the Weekend Knits book.  Great Ornament!

urlLink Free Knitting Pattern: Mini Christmas Stocking   Here's an assignment...
Greetings Shapely Tankers!  I have made absolutely no progress on my Shapely T. As I mentioned in my April 19 post below, I have to rip back to the short row section because I started the waist decreases too soon. For me to rip back requires total and complete concentration. However, I haven't found the time to devote my full and undivided attention to this task. Waah!  I'm leaving on a 11 day trip to Nicaragua tomorrow and I still haven't decided if Shapely T will be my traveling project. Come to think of it, I would get 7 hours of pure knitting time on the plane - hum... well that is if Airport Security will let me on with my knitting weapons, oh I mean, needles.  Other than a Bon Voyage post, I won't be posting here or on my  urlLink knitting blog  until I return. However, I have set up a travel blog where I am chronicling my journey to Nicaragua and back. You can find it  urlLink here  if you're interested. Shameless plug - I know.  I look forward to seeing everybody's progress when I return!  Ciao!
I'm stalled with the back being done yet. I got sidetracked with making a tank top for one of my SIL's birthday on May 3rd (? I think). We'll be celebrating it on Mother's Day. I'm doing a variation of  urlLink Knitty's Sigma  for her. I added waistline shaping using the Shapely Tank pattern as a guideline and I'm doing striping using the Fibonacci sequence so I'm calling it Sequential Sigma. It's really flying (of course it helps that her total circumfrence of the tank in this gauge is only ~30 sts more than 1/2 of my shapely tank, LOL). I've split it at the armholes and have just a few more rows before I start the neck shaping on the back and then I have the front to do, attach the straps and then edge the armholes and neck with a round of single crochet. There are pics at  urlLink my blog . I hope to be back on track with my Shapely no later than the end of n
