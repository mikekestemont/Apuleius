Pretty Girl (The Way) was a song I discovered a year or two ago, its quite good, at least worth listening to.&nbsp; A nice love song, but little edgy. &nbsp; Yeah, well I was reminded of this when I heard their new song Memory on the launch cast radio. &nbsp; Memory bringing back memories. &nbsp; Sorry for posting allllll the songs I find that I like.&nbsp; But I think it is worth it, we can realize each others tastes and such.

Sorry you aren't Christina.   can you tell it bothers me?  "Save us from the wicked, shield our souls..."
Float on is some trippy shit, oh my spinning sheep.  No Sapphire lets not think about what they are doing to the sheep.  And in the silence of the night one might find peace and satisfaction where all other elements have gone to ground the intensity of the silence overpowers simple creatures, simple thoughts and simple dreams Particles of dark emerge, contrasting and confusing the senses, spice in the wind brought to the tiger
