This is a nice day to blog.  I'm here in the kitchen and the kids have already left for the babysitters.  I purposely turned the t.v. off and the fish pond.  You see, the pond has a waterfall.  With that on, i feel i always have to go to the bathroom.  It also doesn't help that i drank 3 cups of coffee this morning.  They(the animals) gave me a run for my money yesterday.  "Prince" didn't want to walk yesterday during our morning stroll, so he had to be carried on my shoulders.  In the hot sun, I felt like i was walking through the desert.  "King" kept asking for apple juice, thus Prince aquired the urge as well.  That was the start.  At the video store, after repeated verbal attempts(threats), Prince and the King continued taking the display videos off the shelves.  They did not get spanked- luckily there was other parents with the same dilemma.  This must be normal, i'm thinking.  We get Jamba Juice and while we're waiting for our juices, Prince is trying to take the pictures off the wall.  Again, more verbal "attempts" and he manages to abstain.  Oh yeah, he is getting mature.  I'll probably miss that in those two when they get older, so i should enjoy it now.  In the meantime, they keep me extremely alert.  We end up at BK for lunch.  As soon as we get the food on our table and we are about to eat, King needs to go.  Oh yes, so we leave the food there and we all take a feild trip to the bathroom.  Prince is getting into everything, i'm trying to clean the toilet area for King, and the King is doing the rain dance.  After that fiasco, all of us had to wash our hands!  We eventually ate our burgers and went straight home to take a nap.  Naptime- Daddy's tired.
Today’s my sister’s birthday and I can’t get a hold of her.  I got a card for her that the boys’ decorated for her.  It’s a little messy, but that’s the boys for you.  It’s also their Ate’s birthday and they decorated that too.  Nicely done I must say.  I have the privilege to stay at the hotel tonight.  I requested an early check-in because of the drama going on at the house.  L took off with S last night to Magic Mountain and her mom did not approve of that.  I don’t know when they’re planning to come back, but I do know I don’t want to be around when they do.  This is one fireworks show I don’t want to see.  Back to the hotel, it’s a lot nicer than the previous one I worked at.  This one is a much upgraded version.  Not only the furnishings, but also the management that works here is much.  They actually work.  They don’t gossip all day on the phone- they work and manage the hotel.  I might stick around here a bit.  Their system and philosophy makes better sense.  Yes, I think this m
