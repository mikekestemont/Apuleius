Ok. Once your profile is finished, go back to the dashboard.  You'll see your blog there - click it, and you should immediately have your posting screen up. This is&nbsp;where all your posts are stored and organised - at the moment, it will say "NO POSTS FOUND". Click "create post" and you're ready to go.   OTHER THINGS:  You have&nbsp;four tabs&nbsp;to work with here: posting, settings, template, and view blog. We'll look at these in more detail later, but basically...  -POSTING is where all your writing happens and is stored -TEMPLATE gives you access to the HTML code -VIEW BLOG lets you preview what the blog will look like when you post  SETTINGS is the tricky one. Explore it in your own time, but&nbsp;remember - if you don't understand it, you probably don't need to. (there are "?" tags attached to anything that has a help file, too).&nbsp; You will need to change the date/time in formatting - we are in GMT 10. For the moment, you can ignore the "blog members" stuff.  Next up: links, comments, and site meters!
Next, you need to complete your profile.   1) You should be on a screen with a dialogue box, ready for you to write things in it. Up the top, there's the "back to dashboard" button - click it.   2) you'll see your blog listed in the "blogs" box. On the right, there's "edit profile". Click it.   3) DO NOT select "show my real name". DO enter your real name. &nbsp;Worry about adding a picture later. add your IM name if you like.&nbsp;Remember that birthdays are written american style (mm/dd/yyyy).&nbsp;  &nbsp;
This is the Important Post -&nbsp; "how to make a blog".   And its not as scary as it looks.   1) go to  urlLink www.blogger.com   2) click "createyour blog now"  3) fill in the form. Remember that your username should be different from your post name, and you need to tell me your passwords.&nbsp;Your post name must be your REAL FIRST NAME. You can choose later whether to display your email address or not, so do enter it here.   4) choose a title and an address. For example: this blog's title is "the hub", and its address is  urlLink www.eightshub.blogspot.com .  5) choose a template. There are a lot more than there ones out there, but for the moment just choose one here. You can upgrade this later.  6) the program will now make your blog.  &nbsp; ps. Big congrats to Tom - his site is already up and running. Smooth work, Tom!
