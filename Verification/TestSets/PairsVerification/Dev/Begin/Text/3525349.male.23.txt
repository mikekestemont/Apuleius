I love how I started this thing and then dont add to it. Well I'm bored again, so it's time time add another chapter to the live of me!....  i'm sitting at home on a saturday watching Jacksons: An American Dream... I'm pathetic and sad. But I'm going out tonight which is good, cause i desperately need it. I cant wait to move into my new apartment and be downtown though, cause living with the parents is a bit tricky. "hey mom, this is the boy i'm bringing home tonight.... dont mind the moaning."  working is slowly killing me. everyone's nice, but frankly, the next IBM employee is not supposed to be me. but whatever, it's money.... still seriously considering porn... not gonna lie... lol. who knows, right?  OH AND! Chris and I got tickets to go see Madonna on July 19th! HOW EXCITING! I made him CRY. He called me and asked if i was serious when i left him an email saying i had bought tickets.... and he was CRYING! it was so cute. he's wanted to see her since he was like 5 and now he'll be front row!  anyway, i think i need a nap. i'm getting tired and I have nothing more to say I will begin updating this more regularly... not that anyone is reading anyway. lol  until we e-meet again,

Follow along if you want..  I'm  always liable  to get myself into fucked  up situations.  that's all for now...  i'll be back later... maybe i'll even explain who I am.
Pride 2004: 4 Days in the Village                                        -- OR --                                Chris' Geography Lesson.       Well, my little children of the corn,  that season is upon us again! The time when the fruits of our great country bask in the gloriously gay sun and spend hours proving that --contrary to popular belief-- the gay population is NOT all about sex, nudity and liqour....   wait a minute!  Has Queer as Folk taught you nothing? This is not 'Gay as Blazes' people, this is PRIDE! the celebration of everything perverse and wrong with the gay village-- which oddly enough has me coming back for more and more and more and more and more....   So here we sit, another mass email engaging us into the story that was this weekend's festivities.  Everyone's counting on me! I must be witty, funny and 'mo beyond belief.... I'll do my best.    Our story of gay starts on a friday morning,   It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. Having just a
