Some of you may have   hit this site and had some weird formatting going on, only to have it disappear upon a reload. You'd better panic, it's a virus. And it's capable of spreading from your computer to YOU! RUN!!
I first ran into Rick at   urlLink  http://www.lies.com   . He seemed like a pretty decent guy -- a bit partisan to the left, but then, most people on lies.com lean one way or another. Too far one way or another, IMHO. Rick usually has some good points oh his blog and comes across as well educated. A stark contrast to the seemingly-headstrong-17-year-old persona he embodies at lies.com. I had no problem with him.  The operative word being "had."  It was in this thread on lies.com (   urlLink  http://www.lies.com/wp/2004/07/18/why-you-should-vote-for-bush/    ) where I would kick loose the pebbles which would in turn jar a boulder that continues to chase me in quite an "Indiana Jones-esque" manner. A boulder of middle-aged fury that follows insignificant little me through this world of big news and important happenings.  I'm sure that anyone who wants to can navigate lies.com and Radically Inept in order to find the sequence of events which is (currently, as of this writing) going on. In short, I disagreed with Rick's assertion that Hitler is interchangeable with Bush, and he then started to go at me on his own site. But it doesn't end there -- I replied to this, and he then chopped that reply to little bits and put me in the context of some assaulting individual to which he was replying to defend himself.  All I can say is that Rick lost a faithful reader of his blog this week. I had a respect for him up until this point, where he proved that he's yet another person with a "with me or against me" complex and is completely disrespectful to those who don't share his views. Partially because of his background, he seems to think he is an expert of all things political, and actually says that me calling him ignorant of Hitler's atrocities is ironic because of his bio.  In short, Rick's background is that he's an American, but he particularly mentions his parents being an escaped East German and a Soldier. My mother has a doctorate in Accounting and holds seminars teaching standards to people all over the world for thousands of dollars per person per day. I help construct her training materials. That doesn't make me an expert commentator of all things in the accounting world.  Rick should more accurately place in his bio that he has no qualifications to speak on anything aside from pest control, for which he's licensed, and "public policy" in which he has a master's [degree]. He's just another schmuck with an internet connection (like the rest of us bloggers). And that's all I have to say on this subject. Unlike Rick, I won't go through the painstaking task of segmenting his writings so I can spin it against him. I'll just let people draw their own conclusions. I don't see i
