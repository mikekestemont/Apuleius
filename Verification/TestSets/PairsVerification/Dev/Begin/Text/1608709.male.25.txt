Football       Alex 'Knight of the Realm' Ferguson and Jose 'Bigger than God' Mourinho were dealt a big ego blow today.  They had combined Captain Planet-style to take on Uefa, Fifa, the Portuguese FA and basically anyone that got in their way. The hoo-har was over greasy faced Prince of pointless step-overs Christiano Ronaldo and Chelsea's 39th new midfielder this year, Tiago, and their involvement in the forthcoming super-douper massiver-than-ever Olympic extravaganza for the Portuguese national team. Fifa snorted a stern 'non' in the general direction of the two managers and that was that. So off to Athens for Lollipop-Ron and Tiago, rather than drizzly Blackburn or muddy Norwich, I bet they're gutted! Presumably other Premiership interest will be provided by Robert Pires in the diving and Ruud van Nistelrooy in the equestrian   (sorry)  .       Everton's woes continue apace. Not only are they busy looking for money down the sides of Merseyside settees, and fending away the vultures from above fat-faced man-child saviour Wayne Rooney, they are also going through board members quicker than Duncan Ferguson spends his sick pay. Insult was added to injury when stuck-up neighbours over the way cocked a scarlet snoot at the Blues' suggestion of a future ground share. As Everton were reeling from this latest body-blow, those cheeky cockney chappies from Fulham had crept up the motorway and sneaked back with subbeteo-proportioned Canadian speedster Tomasz Radzinski in their inside pocket. So some sticky times ahead for the Toffee's, but any upset Bluenoses can at least console themselves that they are not Leeds, and  they  are surely too big to go down...     Transfer news again begins with the spindly figure of Patrick Vieira. Big Paddy seems to be asking himself more personal questions than an adolescent Graham Norton (presumably not the same kind of questions anyway). Not sure if he is a big fan of punk legends The Clash, but in this case of ' Should I Stay or Should I Go ', will the answer be ' Safe European Home ' or will it be ' London Calling '. StavSport is taking this opportunity to say it is frankly sick of these will-they-won't-they transfer sagas that the football-greedy tabloids throw up every year. It reminds me of Penelope Keith and that smug moustachioed fellow in 'To The Manor Born', only without the posh accents and the tweed.     Other sports     A century in both innings for Michael Vaughan announced an emphatic return to form for the captain, as England trounced the West Indies by 200-odd runs. Moon-faced Robert Key picked up his first Test century of his career and then like the big-appetited bloke he surely is, he greedily helped himself to 120 more runs. Strauss continued his Lords' love-in with yet another ton, and if he can find a way to play all his future Test matches at HQ, then he'll have the bearded stattos in the scoring box coughing into their thermos flasks in disbelief as they rewrite the record books. But the bowling hero was not for once 8 foot Geordie Steve Harmison, b
