Somewhere Down The Road  We had the right love At the wrong time Guess I always knew inside I wouldn't have you for a long time  Those dreams of yours Are shining on distant shores And if they're calling you away  I have no right to make you stay  But somewhere down the road Our roads are gonna cross again It doesn't really matter when But somewhere down the road I know that heart of yours will come to see That you belong with me  Sometimes goodbyes are not forever It doesn't matter if you're gone I still believe in us together I understand more than you think I can You have to go out on your own So you can find your way back home  But somewhere down the road Our roads are gonna cross again It doesn't really matter when But somewhere down the road I know that heart of yours will come to see That you belong with me Letting go is just another way to say  I'll always love you so  We had the right love At the wrong time Maybe we've only just begun  Maybe the best is yet to come  Cause somewhere down the road Our roads are gonna cross again It doesn't really matter when But somewhere down the road I know that heart of yours will come to see That you belong with me
