i just wanted to let you know, i love you guys. when i heard page break down during the 8-15-04 Wading, i began to cry. when trey broke down during his post-glide speech, i began again. but when trey says, "lets blow off some phucking steam!" and they tear into a massive Split Open and Melt, bringing the smile back to my phace as mike harmonizes in his dulcet tones. and now, i can honestly say, that i am better and pheel the best i've ever phelt and i owe to a couple of special people, besides Phish, you know who you are.
so the band that has changed my life, changed my entire perception of the world, is gone from my world as quickly as they arrived, with one final, emotional concert last night in Coventry, Vermont. many of my good phriends, including a phriend i've known almost my entire life, was in attendance, and some local helena kids i met this summer. and now it's all over, they played their last song, The Curtain With, a song i was listening to yesterday, a song from a show, another beautiful show, 12-14-95, where the segue gods came out in force and drilled the listener with some insane sounds. page crying during Wading, trey unable to speak, a Split Open and Melt jam to blow the steam off. an insane setlist, an insane end to the most gifted rock band from the last twenty years. in my opinion, the second greatest american rock band behind the grateful dead, the torchbearers for the jam industry. will we never hear another mike's > Hydrogen > Weekapaug, another flawless 2001 > Down with Diseas, and no more Fluffhead's, with Fluff's Travel's included or not. Will we never see page tinkle the ivories on his baby grand, or Joe C or Greasy Fizeek or Henrietta, or whatever Fish's name is that night, pick up his vacuum and play something, Somewhere Over the Rainbow, or Terrapin. Will we never see another Trey face, another Mike head bob, another I Didn't Know? Remember how they sang to us? will this be the end, will this be the last we will see of Phish. Simple answer, no. because when human beings are kind to one another, when human beings share mutual love for one another, when human congregate at special places for strange reasons, phish's legacy will grow, and flourish. and maybe, when the time is right, they will return to us, from their mother ship, and lead us to another place, although i can't imagine a place better than the place they've led me.  Has music ever made you cry? Has a guitar solo ever made you feel like you were being lifeted up onto your feet and carried above all things? Has the voice of a familiar singer never let you down? Has the pounding bass line ever made you slap your wheel so hard that it hurt your hand? Has the sound of the piano meant more to you on the day your grandfather died t
