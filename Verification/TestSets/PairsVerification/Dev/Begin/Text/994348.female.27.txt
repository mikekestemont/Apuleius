POX OFF!   I was missed by Claudia for days, and Marwan has been nagging me for avoiding her like a plague. Well, how can you blame me when I have not been contracted with chicken pox before, and her sons are having the yuckish pox. Man, it's highly contagious when the carrier gets close to anyone who has not contracted it before, and that, unfortunately, is me.  Come to think of it, I have successfully avoided her for a week: giving excuses for not meeting her for lunch by doing installations, doing OT, and many more. But today I have no more to be excused. She messaged me at 2pm exact and asked to meet. Luckily, when I arrived she was with Yanti and the distance between us are a long table apart. I thought I must be safe and even laughed inside when we were about to go off. BUT she dragged me back to our main office and pushed a present towards me. "Happy belated birthday! I wanted to give it to you since last week but you were busy." OOPS. Thousands of emotions filled my guilty mind and wormhole heart. You couldn't imagine how I stood there, with an expression that she couldn't comprehend at all. All I could muster out was a feeble, "Thanks..." With a childish smile she urged me to open the small and compact wrapped gift. (she even made a ribbon to go with it!) It was a nice gift indeed, something that I had mentioned ages ago and she has the heart to remember it. Then she leaned forward (towards me), and told me about some office gossips that she had collected during the past week. There I was, starting to panic, whether the disease will start spreading, going in slowly to my ears, eyes, mouth and nostrils! But what could I do? I was frozen (partly due to the guilt and due to the fact that I had nowhere to move in her cubicle) right there...all I did was to give some responses to her banter. Finally, thanks to a delivery man, I managed to 'escape'. PHEW.  Well she's really an angel... being so nice... so unassuming towards her overly-suspicisous and selfish friend. I ought to be slapped and kicked. I guess the ultimate punishment for mistreating my dear friend would be contracting the virus itself! ARGH!!!  (uh-oh... i'm feeling itchy all over.. pls assure me it's juz my paranoia....)
THE OTHER     A man runs into an old friend who had somehow never been able to make it in life. "I should give him some money," he thinks. But instead he learns that his old friend has grown rich and is actually seeking him out to repay the debts he had run up over the years.  They go to a bar they used to frequent together, and the friend buys drinks for everyone there. When they ask him how he became so successful, he answers that only until a few days ago, he had been living the role of the "Other."  "What i
