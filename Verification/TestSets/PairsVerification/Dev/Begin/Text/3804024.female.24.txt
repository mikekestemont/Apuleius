Ok, this day just keeps getting worse and worse. I am tempted to just crawl under the covers until tomorrow. Or perhaps even until Friday when my vacation starts! My second trainee did not show up this afternoon. She was in a training all day, but I didnt find that out until sitting and waiting on her for 2 hours. There are also rumors flying around about our unit being...disassembled, ambushed, forgotten. But there will be no warning, and we will go where they put us. Which for me means, probably back into investigations. I feel as though I did my time in that department, but would probably be thrown back to the wolves. Who knows...But then it gets better. I go to Target to spend money (because it helps me feel better right? haha...) I wanted to buy Cold Mountain on DVD and a few groceries. So, I get up to the checkout line, write a check, and..."Im sorry mam, your check has been declined. " His words seem to echo...loudly. Everyone stares of course and im mortified. So, he gives me the number to call and the people say I have an outstanding check to Wal Mart for 208 dollars on May the 8th.  Now, there are several problems with this. One, I dont think I have EVER written a check to Wal Mart for 200 dollars. And two, I was in Las Vegas on May 8th. So, I call Wal Mart. "Oh Im sorry mam, its not your name on the check, but it IS your drivers license number." So, apparently either the cashier wrote it wrong, or someone is using my number. Either way, I got screwed. Needless to say I left the store without anything, besides fumes coming out of my ears. Then I get home, and HE is here. Of course, they are in the bedroom, door shut. My mom comes out and tells me to order pizza, and goes back in the room. The pizza arrives, and they take the entire thing in to their room. UGH. Its just the little stupid things about the whole situation that make me crazy. Mostly, I miss my dad. What he must be thinking..haha. I can only imagine.
Well, I figured that today was as good as any to start..again..my online journaling. I have journaled almost all of my life in some form or other. It is sometimes the only place I have to vent, or to express my feelings.  It is the one place I can ramble on and on, and no one really cares. It is a reflection of my true, inner self...a side of me that not many people get to see. So, someone has inspired me to restart my online journal, and here I am.   I would almost swear that today was Monday, with the way things have gone. I drove halfway to Houston, before realizing I was supposed to be going to Galveston.  My vacation request was not fully approved. And after driving all the way to Galveston, my trainee did not s
