I weighed myself this morning and was thrilled to see that I'm down to 284.0. That's a total of 12 1/2 lbs. lost. Last Monday I had gained three pounds so I was starting to get worried. Dieting is terrible and I know that's why I've never been successful at it in the past. You go on a diet and, for a while it works. You feel great, you start to look great and everybody is so excited and so proud of you. Then you hit that inevitable plateau... and suddenly, everything starts going wrong. Instead of people saying "you look great! How much weight have you lost?" You begin hearing, "So, how's that diet thing going for ya?" That's when you know you're in trouble. You lose a bit of the drive. You get depressed, anxious, and inevitably... fat. It's a traumatic rollercoaster of blubber and you know that when you hit bottom, there's a breathless crowd of people there waiting to commend you on the ride - when you know that the part that really counts, staying on the ride, is where you failed. Again. It gets depressing. For a long time I kinda gave that up. I refused to look at a scale. I looked in the mirror every day and said "I think you're great" (to myself). I refused to wear make-up and the 'in' clothing, convincing myself that I was rebelling from what the masses did. But what I was really doing was lying to myself. I hated those girls who wore the latest fashions, but not because they were sheep. I hated them because I wanted to  be  a sheep. So instead, I made myself different out of... spite? I like to think of it as finding my niche. And in a way, I did. I had a few good, close friends who loved me for who I was (you know who you are) and I learned to appreciate the differences in myself, including my fat. Let's face it, if I had been one of those girls with the gigantic bangs, pegged bongo jeans and esprite tops, I probably wouldn't be the person I am today. I shudder to think of all I would have missed. But while I was trying to convince myself of my worth (which my fat always got in the way of), I was ignoring a (pun intended) swiftly growing problem. Namely, me.  The summer before I started High School I was getting dressed to go somewhere with my mom. I was putting on my jeans in the bathroom when I suddenly looked in the mirror for the first time in I don't know how long. I mean  really looked.  I burst into tears because the girl who was reflected back to me was not who I saw myself as. This has been a recurring problem for me. I don't feel as heavy as I really am. In my mind, I don't look as heavy as I really do. I had been so busy convincing myself that I loved myself j
