Hopefully soon I'll be able to try out Longhorn.
Darn snow!  At least it melted some what today.  Planning on playing some badminton at lunch today should be fun!  Heres some neat tid bits/buzz words form Microsoft PDC youll see in the next few years:  WinFX: the successor to Win32   ClickOnce: the "equivalent of Xcopy to a machine" that will make application install/deinstall a snap.  SuperFetch: a feature designed to improve and speed up the current paging system  XAML: a declarative markup language that will separate code and content in the next generation of Windows applications  MSBuild: a unified build engine for Windows, the Windows software development kit and Visual Studio.  You can learn more about the PDC here:  urlLink http://mymsevents.com/MyMSEvents/Default.aspx?se=31   Anyway have a wicked day!
Well looks like the snow is going to let up and I might actually be able to get home!  Heres something neat:   urlLink http://games.mess.be   An add in to MSN 6 that allows you to play other games created by others.  I really like battleship and Tetris.  Growing up I remember playing tetris for hours and hours on the game boy!
Another Monday morning in Winnipeg!  It has snowed finally, and still is snowing.  Time to get the winter tires on the Mustang.  I've been playing around with Microsoft Content Management Server on Windows 2003 and found out something rather interesting.    If you want it to work make sure you Install it without the Dev tools, upgrade it with the service pack 1, then install the Dev tools.  Otherwise you'll have to install VS.net 2002 and 2003, what a pain.  Anyway just thought I'd throw that out there.  Well anyway I hope it stops snowing soon, otherwise its going to be a painfully drive home!  I really need to get winter tires on soon I guess, crappers... Ok I called Ford, getting the butt ugly tires on this Saturday at 9 am... yippie! Ugly rims for 6 months... Oh well.  Anyway I better get back to working!  Miguel
Last night...  Before I went to bed I read about MainSoft leaking the code... They didnt mean to.... However the funny part is it was a linux machine that was compromised to get the code lol.  Boy am I glad I dont work with those guys...  So if you were thinking of installing linux now... I highly suggest against that lol  Miguel
Windows 2000 and NT4 code has been leaked...  "update Microsoft is investigating how a file containing some protected source code to Windows 2000 was posted to several underground sites and chat rooms. " from cnet.. they are so slow.. but anyway, yes it was leaked.. 203MB file, however the code was incomplete... hmmmmmmmmmm the begining of the open source movement from microsoft.  I personally am in some ways happy about the way microsoft has been going about this.  Share certain portions of code... however you still own it.. they own it. give them feedback.. they will fix it.  Not the.. heres the code... feel free to contribute.   I think its ok to make certain parts of the code "open source", b
