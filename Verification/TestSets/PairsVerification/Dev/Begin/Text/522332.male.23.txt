As a person who likes to see peoples civil rights respected, I was pleased when the Supreme Court of Canada was looking at a  urlLink draft bill  sent by the Canadian House of Commons that could potentially redefine what marriage is in Canada. Since then three provinces have allowed same sex marriages. It pleases me that I live in a country where it is recognized that although many disagree with this new definition of marriage, we are talking about peoples civil rights and legal benefits.
Now, on the issue of File sharing, I am again impressed. And as  urlLink this article  explains, it would appear that Canada is once again the centre of attention. On this issue, I take a liking to the ideas of  urlLink Lessig .
I've spent the past five (5) days feeling groggy, dizzy, and downright messed up. It feels like a 24/7 hang over, without the enjoyment of being drunk. I'd love to take tonight off work. If only I could afford to, but I'm in desperate need of tip money, from delivering pizzas.
Matthew asks me today if I am planning on going downtown, which means he either wanted to come with me, or he wanted me to grab him something. I decided not to answer his question, or speak to him at all really. If he wants to come with, that'll just piss me off because he'll want to talk.

Matthew walks in the door and starts talking to my cat, Fuzz Butt. I talk to Fuzz Butt all the time, so no, that didn't bother me in the slightest. Then he starts whistling totally out of tune with my music, asking me why I'm not out somewhere and asking me if I want to go for a jog with him. There is no way in hell that I was not visibly annoyed by all his questions and comments, although he didn't seem to notice because he kept going. Several times I gave him my hand to talk to, but I guess even with my unhappy tone of voice I was more interesting to talk to... Who cares whether I wish to talk or not.
After ignoring him for a while, he figures maybe I can't hear him. With his booming voice? I'm sure all the neighbors could hear him. And my gestures as to the fact that I wasn't interested in talking to him? They didn't matter a bit. So he pauses my music and asks me if I want to go for a jog with him. I was nearing my breaking point. Had I not been obvious e
