NHS Direct - self-help guide Sinusitis ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Although inflammation and infection of the hollow spaces of the face bones is extremely painful, it is rarely serious. Some people suffer from repeated sinusitis while others avoid the problem altogether. We do not know why. Many people develop sinus congestion with a cold, but this rarely develops into a bacterial infection.  Symptoms The way sinusitis affects you depends upon which of your sinuses - the hollow bone cavities - is affected. It can feel like severe toothache or like a headache with tenderness under the eyebrows. Generally, your nose feels blocked up and your voice has a nasal sound. It can last for weeks but most will clear up within 7 days.  Causes We know that the sinuses fail to drain though their ducts into the back of the nose and that it often follows a cold or allergic attack, but we don't really know why.  Complications Serious complications such as infection spreading into the bone are now very rare.  Self care Pain relief is important. Take aspirin (not for children under 16 years), paracetamol or ibuprofen.  Decongestants may help initially but their overuse simply makes matters worse, particularly when you stop taking them.  Sniffing very hard, though not sounding very pleasant, can be very effective at clearing the mucus from the sinuses.  Sometimes, lying with your head over the end of the bed so it is lower than your shoulders and then sniffing hard can be effective.  Stop smoking.  Try inhaling steam from a bowl of hot water or try menthol inhalations.  Your doctor may prescribe you antibiotics but they penetrate the sinuses very slowly and you need to take them in high doses for quite a while. There are surgical treatments to flush out the sinuses, which were very common but are now only rarely performed.
1) The main symptom of sinusitis is pain and the location of the pain depends on which sinus is affected.  • Maxillary sinuses – affection of the maxillary sinuses causes an ache in the upper jaw(maxilla) and teeth. The cheeks become to tender to light pressure or even touch. • Frontal sinuses – when the forehead is touched or lightly pressed, and pain is induced, the cause is likely to be frontal sinusitis. • Sphenoid sinuses – infections not common but can present as ear-aches, neck pain and sometimes deep aching in the head. • Ethmoid sinuses – these sinuses are located between the eyes and cause swelling of the eyelids and surrounding tissue as well as causing a pain between the eyes. There can also be anosmia (loss of smell) and tenderness when the sides of the nose are palpated.  Having stated this, the majority of sinus infections involve more than one cavity, and pain is found in several spots-  2) Head pain on waking in the morning  3) A low grade fever between 99F and 100F  4) Weakness or tiredness  5) A cough that is more prevalent at night  6) A runny nose (rhinitis)   7) Nasal congestion  8) Halitosis (bad breath)  9) Eyes are sensitive t
