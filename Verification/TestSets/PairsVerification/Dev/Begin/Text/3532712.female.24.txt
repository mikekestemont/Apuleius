Have you ever you ever reached a rainbow's end And did you find your pot of gold Ever catch a shooting star Tell me how high did you soar Ever felt like you were dreaming Just to find that you're awake Cause the magic that surrounds you Will lift you up and guide you on your way  I can see it in the stars across the sky Dreamt a hundred thousand dreams before Now I finally realize See I've waited all my life for this moment to arrive And finally yeah  I believe in the impossible If I reach deep within my heart Overcome any obstacle Won't let this dream fall apart See I strive to be the very best Shine my light for all to see Cause anything is possible  When you believe yeah  I can see it in the stars across the sky Dreamt a hundred thousand dreams before Now I finally realize I've waited all my life for this moment to arrive And finally I believe Yes I believe  Ohh Yeah  Love keeps liftin me higher Liftin me higher Love keeps liftin me higher I said love keeps liften Love keeps liften me  I said Love keeps liften  Love keeps liften me higher Said love keeps liften me higher I said love keeps liften me high   [ www.LyricsTop.com ]
Singers come and go... though there are some who become big-named divas from being pop superstars, there are also those who are (unfortunately) one-hit wonders.  One famous song and their careers go kaput...  So what makes Fantasia Barrino different? Well, aside from enduring months of rehearsals, result shows and of course, Simon (love that guy), Fantasia for me is an ultimate entertainer.  When she comes on stage, it's like you want to be close to her... to just listen to her as she sings and allow yourself to feel.  She's such an emotional singer that you can feel her song -- even if you've never heard the song before!  She makes you listen to the words and truly understand what those words meant.  Fantasia -- she's not just a good voice.  She's a GREAT voice with a winning personality to match.  She's humble, she loves life, she's like fun personified!  She always has this big smile on her face that gets you smiling too.  When she sings un upbeat song, you'd find yourself dancing as well! She's just amazing!  Oh well, what else can I say about this great Idol?  She's just so perfect... she really deserves to win.  Till my next post... Fantasia Fanatic -- out!
