I love you, man. In a gross, perverted, four finger kind of way.
Are you tied down? I can say quite honestly at times I feel this way. This is a real feeling that is part of being human. Some may happily skip through an entire lifetime devoid of this feeling, but that does not make them lucky, or any better off. Our reaction to the feeling of being "tied down" can shape how we live out the rest of our days. I have a child, a 55 hour per week job, a mortgage payment, car payment, etc., etc. At times it can be overwhelming. But at the same time, my daughter is what gets me to work every day, what keeps the bills getting paid. The realization that I can do whatever I want at any time if I have but the courage to make a choice is what keeps my heart pumping. We have but one life here. To live without making yourself happy makes life pointless. Know that everybody feels tied down at some point. It doesn't mean we must always feel this way. Life is an ongoing struggle, filled with moments of unprecedented joys and heartbreaks. Life is a hodgepodge of good and bad. Concentrating on the bad will only bring more of it. So it is of the strictest importance that during times of difficulty, know that there are plenty of good times yet to be had.
Postmodern. Does anyone really know what that word means? Every individual has his or her own way to define it, which is the best definition I've been able to find.

America was forced to find an all-encompassing culture to fit the "needs" of all cultures that have flocked here. The "culture industry" has formed as a result of this. An industry that grasps the "it" thing of the moment, bleeds it dry, and moves on to the next. We have a tendency to allow ourselves to be treated as infants, to let those with inexhaustable resources do the thinking for us. The less the masses think for themselves, the more they depend on someone else. The industry thrives on this. The masses are an assembly line, waiting to be programmed, to be told what's cool, so they can have an identity.    The irony lies in the fact that in a truly postmodern society, there is no identity. The moment one attempts to stand out, he/she is admitting the culture industry has control. Attemtping to be original in any aspect (art, fashion, architecture, etc.) is owning up to the fact that the industry has significantly affected one's life. Sometimes people consciously choose an identity in an attempt to stand apart from the system and are consequently sucked right back into the system they are seeking to avoid. People acknowledge the power of the system by choosing a way to live to attempt to break f
