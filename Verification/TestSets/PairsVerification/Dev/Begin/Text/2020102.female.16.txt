"If you don't stand for something, you will fall for anything."  How true.
It has a lot of holes and is not entirely complete but it is still okay.  It is nothing near the quality of a school essay.  Of course I am right.  Everyone, at one point or another, witnesses the stereotypical kindergartener’s argument whether it is over equipment, rules of a game, or whether they scored or not.  It always seems to follow out the same way. "Yeah huh," "No!" "Yeah, my daddy said so!" However, do we really grow out of pointless arguing?  It seems that no matter how mature we supposedly become, our arguments will forever remain either unnecessary or utterly pointless.  I will demonstrate that the majority of arguments are results of issues that could otherwise be avoided.  For example, pride, or the inability to admit you are wrong causes a multitude of unnecessary arguments.  Such as when we choose to not even consider another’s point of view; naturally assuming that we are right.  The argument at this moment is void, since no progress will be made toward influencing either of the individuals.  An effort must be made to at least explore the opposing participants case; at which point if the case is deemed valid in our mind, we must concede, if only part of the argument.  If, however, we find the person’s case true and continue to debate them, then we are simply arguing for the sake of dispute and are much like the children on the playground.  In the same way, bad communication, or lack of understanding other’s positions, causes misunderstandings that may develop into an argument.  I cannot forget the time in which a friend of mine and I got into a particularly fierce disagreement and after one of his remarks I looked at him and said, "That is exactly what I have been trying to tell you."  What we had not realized before beginning wrapped up into the argument was exactly what the other was trying to prove.  An easily fixable situation is neglected simply because people fail to take the time to understand one another, therefore causing a pointless argument that will always end in frustration.   The most viable reason for an argument would be conflict of interest, in which, because of differing personal beliefs, parties have different solutions to different problems.  Conflict of interest is the most understandable reason to argue, but may still be avoided if a calm discussion is enacted and a compromise is reached.  However, if parties refuse to settle the dispute in a tranquil manner, it will ultimately lead to a battle of some sort, whether in the media, with friends, or in extreme situations, war.    Consequently, most arguments are preventable by simply evaluating the causing factors.  Whether it is because of pride, bad communication or conflicts of interest, most are capable of being averted.  In addition, if we took more time as humans to understand what is the causing of arguments, and then prevented them, harmony as a
