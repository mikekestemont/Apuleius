bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla .... now in visual programming ... waiting for cairu to email me the commands for the freaking project. its not done yet ... argh ... i am BORED!!!! anyway, today in a better mood ... just going to do the basics and hand it up ... hope can pass la ... anyway, think i made a new friend. His name is qi xiang, in del's class and also huimin's friend from her sec school(i think).  well, talking about guys, i miss Him sooo much ... dunno whether he has returned back to Germany already ... think he should have been back already and preparing to start school ... haiz ... cant wait till the end of the year to go and see him !!!! hahaha ... think i am going mad soon!!!! haha ...
