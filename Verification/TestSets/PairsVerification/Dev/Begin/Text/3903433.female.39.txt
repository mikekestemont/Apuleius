We've finished three out of four days of our craniosacral class. There are about 50 people in our class, a lot of really, really good people. When I was at school and elsewhere, I felt like a bit of an outsider because it seemed I was in a place few could help me, except for the instructors. Finally, I walked into a room and for the first time, I felt like the baby in the group. It's been exhilarating, the combined energy just catapulted everyone up several levels. I suspect we're weeks to even months ahead of where we would be had we been working alone. I've also, finally, hooked into an awesome network of craniosacral therapists so hopefully, from now on, I'll be able to get more regular work done.  Prior to class, I quit most other forms of healthcare maintenance I was doing, except acupuncture. No chiropractic for three months, no rolfing for over a month, no other craniosacral work for two months; needless to say I was a wreck by the time I walked in that classroom. (The things I do in the name of research!) I'd mixed so many different modalities that when my health improved it was impossible to tell which modality or modalities were responsible for the improvement. I knew enough to know the chiropractic alone wasn't successful; moving the bones without working on the soft tissue meant I was forever going in for adjustments, with small improvements coming over the course of months with no end in sight. But I honestly didn't know if craniosacral therapy alone was sufficient, and I wanted to find that out this weekend.  Prior to class I knew enough to start practicing on myself. I tried and tried and tried to palpate my own cranial rhythms. I did get to a point where I noticed this weird undulation, but wasn't sure what it was and certainly didn't know enough to tell what direction it was going and what it was doing. I know  some people think it's a sham, and I was open enough to that being a possibility; another possible option was that I didn't have the sensitivity to palpate this. I'd seen articles rebutting the idea of craniosacral rhythms because when they did tests, practitioners couldn't seem to agree on the rhythms objectively.  First day we got in there, and luckily with the background work I did, I could at least admit I felt something. And surprisingly, about 75% of the class felt something. We have a remarkably eclectic group. Mostly LMTs, a small group still in school, two (including me) who had just passed the nationals recently, a microbiologist/violinist, computer science/pianist veteran (me), a woman who was an airline mechanic with a reputation as The go-to person for air conditioning and fuel systems, a critical care nurse, PTs, occupational therapists, etc etc.  Luckily I bring my laptop to class and take notes in real time (I've used UNIX since the mid-70's when I was in 7th grade, so I've been using vi or a pre-variant o
