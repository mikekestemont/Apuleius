Finally have gotten around to sharing my trip photos. See many posts under this. Mark and I went to Egypt last month (April 2004) for 2 weeks and it was really a great trip.  This is just a selection as I don't have all day to put them on here!  In fact I now have to go clean some walls to finally apply some tiles to the separate toilet, which will coordinate to the bathroom (these are in different rooms upstairs in this house, no idea why).  Mark has spent all day removing the old pink (ugh!) toilet and moving a drain pipe.  Like hours it has taken.  We can't tile the bathroom itself until next week as we have to wait for a plasterer to do some work, and he's coming Tuesday.  Fun times.

The DVLA (Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency) in this country is REALLY dumb.  They have figured out that most Canadians drive automatics, and so have restricted Canadians driving in the UK to only automatic cars unless you can prove with documentation that you passed your Canadian test on a manual car.  HOWEVER, they have not clued up to graduated licencing.  I exchanged a G2 Ontario licence for a full UK licence! ha ha!  The best part is that my G2 was going to expire this October, meaning if I didn't take a full G test in Ontario, I was going to be reduced to a G1 again.  And now if I go back to Canada, I can either get a G2 or a G licence automatically by exchanging my shiny new one (depending on how many year's driving experience I get here).  I just got it today.  So alas Mark's car is manual.  But at l
