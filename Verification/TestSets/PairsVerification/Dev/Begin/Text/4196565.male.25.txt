[work] ah man... i'm like sitting here waiting for a 29 meg flash mx file to save, bored to death... (da idea is that if i save it under a new name, the file size should theorectically get smaller)...      [work] what da heck!! it's been over 15 minutes and it's not done savin'... goth dan 'em smuckaroo! i'm gonna quit it and keep the damn 29 megs... just a waste of time... a waste of moi-freakin' time...      [work] crud... it's the invasion of the sniffles... my life force is bein' sucked out of me... ahhhhhhhhhhh.... i'm fallin', fallin', fallin'.......      [work] huh?!  oh, i fell asleep typing...  i can see the drool runnin' down the keyboard...  eeeewwwwwwwwwwwww.........

ah, it seems i decided to degrade from the hasty life of real-time online chatting to a simplistic, but nevertheless satistfying, method of board posting communcation... reminds me of those great times i had with bbs (bulletin board systems for you high-tech infants)... damn, that makes me feel so wretchedly old... and to think i've only lived for a quarter of a century...      well, i guess i can use this to keep my sanity intact... if i can write down the things i've done or thought about, perhaps i can actually learn something about myself that might surprise me... then again, i surprise myself by being myself everyday so it's won't be much of a surprise, eh... bummer...      on a happier note, i got a contract job a week ago (03|11|03)... i should be estatic, especially since the work is related to flash mx and xml, but after workin 10 hrs each day straight, it can take away the excitement, ya know what i mean? still, it is a good change in the horribly slow pace i was living as an unemployee (is there such a word? if not, there should be!)...      i'll leave my first post by shouting out, NGO NGOI NEI to the one who lightens my heart everyday with her shining brillance... although, her constant nagging is popping a nerve or two now and again, but it's all good (i hope)... LUV YA, DARLIN' DEAR!    © pu out ©     =======    [[ Commented by liljerms on November 12, 2003 ]]    coo man. what's a bbs? I must b
