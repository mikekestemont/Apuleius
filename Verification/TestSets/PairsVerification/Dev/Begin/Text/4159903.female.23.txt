This is dedicated to Locke (soon to be a district resident--hold onto your hats, folks!) and everyone who thought my last list was too negative.  Well, not surprising because sometimes I "excude negativity."    Here are 30 Things I Like :  1.  Water 2.  Inky pens (like fine point sharpies) 3.  Bus transfers 4.  People who play with my hair 5.  Flossing 6.  Driving on curvy roads 7.  Cozy sweatshirts 8.  Moss 9.  Sticky lint roller things 10.  Gouache 11.  Hashbrowns 12.  Tape (actually maye this is an obsession rather than a like...) 13.  The U.S. Botanic Gardens 14.  A breeze 15.  Chocolate, in any and all (nut-free) forms.  Especially ice cream... 16.  People who are funny 17.  New socks 18.  Pi Phi Nachos 19.  The gritty/crunchy feeling in your mouth after you go to the dentist 20.  The West Coast, baby. 21.  Licking stamps 22.  Beer in the office 23.  BBQs 24.  Mi Rancho 25.  Guys with nice backs 26.  Ice skating 27.  Shouting "church" everytime we pass one on 16th street.  (I feel like this may be on Laura's 30 Thing I Hate List, however.) 28.  Getting developed pictures back 29.  Camping (sigh) 30.  Bridges
Today I applied for jobs. Well I actually watched Olympics while applying for jobs....Okay, I actually applied for jobs while watching the Olympics. Hmmm....maybe I should find a new place to work tomorrow that is not my couch.  I have a hard time watching the Olympics without being distracted by trying to determine how attractive the athletes are. I am fascinated by the weird looking ones, namely the weight lifters and the gymnasts (these people appear to simply be smooshed). I marvel at how pretty the women's volleyball team is--no really, I think they got switched during a photo shoot at Sports Illustrated with the swimsuit models. I also like to try and make general conclusions about entire sports--male swimmers: wide muscular shoulders and nice bodies, female swimmers: wide muscular shoulders which is much less fetching on a woman, male rowers: whoa. those guys are good looking.  I can't help but feel like this sort of inattention to the determination and dreams of the athletes replaced by judgments about attractiveness makes me a little shallow. Okay, a lot shallow.  Man. Those rowers are hot...
I should be working on job applications. So, naturally, I have decided to compose a list of:   30 Things I Hate : 1. When I have a whole bunch of reciepts in the money pocket of my wallet 2. Mosquitoes 3. Hair after it is detached from the head 4. People who get mad while driving 5. Not having chapstick on hand at all times 6. People who sit too close to you on the metro 7. Slippery flip-flops as a result of rain 8. Gwen Stephani 9. Pro-Bush stickers 10. Pills on the butt of a bathing suit 11. Peppers 12. Not being able to find the right windshield wiper speed (one is too fast, the next one down is too slow) 13. Sticky tables in resturants/bars 14. Carbonation 15. Guys w
