Recently Times of India had done some interviews with some Prostitutes, Pimps etc and discovered a shocking revelation. Most of the prostitutes were actually well-educated girls from well-to-do families, into this profession for just some extra money (read fast money) or some fun. It was really painful to read their revelations and stories.  Some of the links to these stories can be found at Indiatimes at  http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/756224.cms http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/756175.cms http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/757775.cms http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/755364.cms http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/754002.cms http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/754880.cms http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/753991.cms http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/754659.cms  The first reaction I had after reading this article was that of disappointment and shock.  It was really disheartening to read that some girls can stoop down to such a level that they would have to take to this 'business' in order to make quick money.  If it was an uneducated girl having problems in her house, and if she takes to prostitution, it is understandable, although she has options like taking up jobs like that in a Construction Site, or as a Maid Servant or a Municipality worker, etc. or any other menial job. If it was an educated girl having problems in her house, and if she takes to prostitution, it is deplorabale because since she is educated, she can very well take up a atleast some respectable job, and not prostitution. If a girl has been forced into prostitution by somebody, even then it is understandable because the turn of events in her life have landed her here, and it is important that efforts be done to save such people out of this profession.  But, the most shameful thing is, an educated girl, coming from a well-to-do family, taking to prostitution, just for extra money, or for fun. There could not be anything more shameful than this that one could have imagined. It depicts the fragile state of mind of such 'loose character' females who do not have the emotional strength to take up more challenging jobs worthy and pertinent to their education and skills.  According to Swami Vivekananda, "unless it held and developed the spirit of true womanhood, there could be no education of woman worthy of the name." For him, true womanhood consisted in "the old-time intensity of trustful and devoted companionship to the husband,"  It gives me pain to see this state of today's the so-called 'educated' and 'liberated' woman. I used to have atleast some respect for women seeing their achievements in a Man's world and was happy to note that they were proving to be as good as men in every field. But my respect for women has gone down drastically after reading these articles. This is not how our culture was supposed to  be. We are in a phase of largely aping other cultures and we have neither succeeded nor failed.  I had learnt that Education can make even an Animal to behave like a Human. But these article prove that wrong. Inspite of being educated, some people still remain animals. It is utterly shameful to note that a woman who has donned different roles like that of a Mother, a Daughter, a Wife, etc, has taken t
