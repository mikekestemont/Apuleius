Today, from The Net    It's the classic test entry - enjoy!
Today, from The Net    Well, if you missed AMPED this sunday @ THE WAREHOUSE, you missed Curt and Paul checking out a Playboy to demonstrate how much people try to hide the fact that they are tempted by sexual sin. You also missed Dave's description of the nude beach he happened to go on while he was on vacation recently - it was pretty funny because no one who was on the beach without clothes was under 70 years old and Dave seemed to think it burned out his eyes.  Dave said that Porn is something we have to avoid and something we have to make every effort to stop dealing with. It's a bad problem, but one that even Bible guys,like David had, and were able to overcome, with God's help. You can do it too.  How do you avoid porn on the internet? Leave a comment below.

Have an awesome Because HE is Awesome!) day!

For those of you who know Nick Catt - he's coming here to NYC next year to help do a church plant - so pray for him, and for all here who don't know the Lord.
Today, from The Net    Today, we all talked about stealing on The Net - it's tough to figure out who is who on the net these days, but with God's help, we can do the right thing - next week, we're talking about Purity On the Net.  Look Out!  Parents are invited!
