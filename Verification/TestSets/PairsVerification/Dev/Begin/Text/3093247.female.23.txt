victory!  a danish proverb!  anyway...  today at work was so completely surreal.  i was on shakes, meaning i don't get to share my lovely personality with just anyone.  in fact, today i got to share it with no one, save the ice cream tubs at which i cursed vehemently every time i had to change them out (there just HAS to be a better way). the thing about shakes is, i just like drinking them.  on to surrealism.  the other fun part about being on shakes is fronting, meaning you get to wipe down the tables, "be personable" (after cursing at the ice cream tubs, who wants to deal with people!), and otherwise pretend to be doing actual work.  we were slow, and i was caught between two images.  the first was quite appropriate for what seemed to be the general mood dujour:  the sinking titanic scene (from said movie) where the violinists continue playing despite the chaos around them.  at potbelly sandwich works, we have independent artists who come and perform during lunch (sometimes to our dismay, especially when "wheels on the bus" is the artist's fave pick).  today the potbelly titanic was sinking to hey jude.  and then some elton john songs.  i don't know.  all i know is, i was wiping the tables and couldn't help feeling apart from the erratic cacophony around me.  the second image, more comical and less poignant, was of the scene in pleasantville where the guy in the diner just keeps wiping the counter... and wiping the counter...  and wiping the counter.  Freedom is a horse.  and i know how to ride.
the road to a friend's house is never long.  (some kinda proverb).
for grins, get a new email account  urlLink here .    tonight there were amazing stars out.  i drove home with my chin on the steering wheel so i could look up through my windshield.  this, in my humble opinion, is the best time for the sky; before the humidity and bugs set in and after the cold and snow.  i should spend less time blogging and more time looking at them.  what i like about the stars is that they haven't changed in millions of years.  not that they haven't changed; in fact many of them no longer exist in technical terms because they expired millions of years ago and only now the light has reached us (or me).  what was going here or elsewhere in the universe when the light i see tonight was originally released?  but still, i see the same pictograms that the ancient greeks and egyptians philosophized and debated; i like feeling that sort of connection to transcend time.  tonight the sky is an eternal blankness and a thousand stories all at once.
