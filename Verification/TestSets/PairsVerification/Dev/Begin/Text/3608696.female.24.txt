Last night, I went to a social with Jenny and her stupid ass boyfriend aaron who both did coke before we went. An ill omen I thought. We didnt go to the social until just after 11, when Celine finally showed up. Anyways we got there, and I knew 90% of the people. They were pretty psyched to see me, which made my day better. Jen, Aaron and Celine went and sat at a table with some people that I didn't know. So I made my way slowly to the table, and noticed a decent looking guy checking me out. S'all good, I smiled and made eye contact. Left to go get a drink and dance. Came back and he introduced himself to me... Wes Goodon. His brother had went out with Jen's sister Allison quite a few years ago. He seemed really interested and bought me a drink. We danced and he asked me if we wanted to go back to his sister's after the social. We decided we would go to the bar before we went there but that we would make an appearance after that. Jen told me that he was single, but that he had 2 kids and broke up with his ex about 3 months ago. I was a little apprehensive, but he seemed like a really nice guy so I said whatever.Jen, Aaron and I went to Gravity. Wes's sister Amy met us there, while Wes and her bf, Brian went back to their place. After the bar we headed over to Amy's me being my klutzy self tripping over the sidewalk and my feet... Aaron and Jen "had to go get something" so Amy and I went in by ourselves. Wes came and kissed me which was pretty good and we cuddled in a cool chair. He let me know about his situation - his ex, the fact they had 2 kids, and had given 1 up for adoption. He seemed really sweet and sincere and I asked him if he was sure that he wanted to get into something, if he was ready. He said yes. Jen and Aaron came and left, and Wes told me that if I stayed there that night I could get a ride in the morning. So I stayed there (nothing happend), and got a ride in the morning. we exchanged phone numbers, and he said he'd call. Which he did, that night. Seemed nice, but I told him I'd call him on the Monday, as I was busy tonight and Sunday. Going to Houston's tonight with Marnie... should be fun!!
Bar last night was kinda lame, we went and everyone that we didn't want to see appeared there. The only good people who were there were J Chum and Amy, and Wes's brother's gf Jayme. Apparently Wes must've been talking about me, bc she knew who I was and said Lisa from last night Lisa? SO we chatted a bit, and Marnie and I ended up leavign early - around 12:30, which was ok, since I had f
