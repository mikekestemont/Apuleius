I have found,  and for selfish reasons,  that the reporting of the war in Iraq misses some of the most important stories and reports non-events.  In Baghdad any event goes over as the start of the Iraqi Tet Offensive.  Some of the most useless reporting comes from the reporting of so-called controlled explosions.  A controlled explosion is where a piece of unexploded ordinance,  an enemy mortar or rocket,  is blown under supervision of EOD.  These happen in every city and town where Coalition forces are stationed.  Here in Mosul we have the Mad Mortarman.  About once a week he moves around the city dropping round within 200 meters of the base,  rarely do they cause damage.  Watching the news you would think that not only does the war only happen in Baghdad but the rest of the country sits by the pool drinking pomegranate juice.  Also it is not as bad as the media makes out but it's still war.  No soldier will ever admit to that because he wants to tell the "I'm a hero"  stories when he gets home.  The Northern region of the country has its fighting but Fallujah and Baghdad are the darlings.  By doing this selective reporting they 1. keep reporters in an easy location and 2. make you think it's much worse than it actually is.  The war reporting as it is now shorts all the Servicemen in this theater who are not in the two darling cities.  Another problem is the impression of total breakdown of relations with the Iraqi people.  In the months I have been here I have had only a few incidents where someone has said a cross word to me and most of them were children not aware of the meaning.  Talk to the majority of Iraqis and they will tell you they are glad the war eliminated the Ba'ath party and Saddams 23 million man slave ring.  This is a country added to the list of nations that the people in many years will say, "I remember when the Americans came to liberate us".  Aside from the reasons we came in, WMD's,  the UN,  Bush's revenge for Dad,  all Joe (slang for any soldier) knows is that he was part of a liberation of a people and the removal of a despot,  and that is the kind of war ALL soldiers want to be a part of.  The American people have been spoonfed the news of this war in a way that makes the Left think it's a disaster,  the Right proclaim victory,  and the soldiers wondering what the fuck is happening everywhere but in their corner.  The facts are that most Iraqis love us,  some hate us,  Iraq is far from over,  and in the end historians will judge the right and wrong of this war.  All I know is the people are free and Saddam is going to hang for his crimes.  Remember,  up until the war started the entire world hated Saddam until it was time to get bloody.    WMD's were a fact to ALL p
