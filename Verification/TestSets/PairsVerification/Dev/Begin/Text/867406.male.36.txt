Well, this is my first post to my first blog.  Who knows what this will incite.  Perhaps it will just die a lonely death like so many other dabblings started with good intentions.  You know, life and all that getting in the way.  Or is it just laziness?  So, what should I write about?  Well, I guess I can give some initial info about myself and some warnings.  First I’ll give the warnings.  I have a tendency to be a little verbose sometimes and to write in a stream of consciousness way.  I'll try to avoid this as much as I can.  I'll also try to spell-check and proof my writing as much as I can.  I have a bad habit of including lots of typos.  Does it matter that much in a blog?  I would guess so because your audience is other blog writers who tend to be good at writing, right?  Ok, well, maybe I'm biased.

However, I believe one can always make time for things one really wants to work on, so I'm hoping this will give me an added motivation to write in general that will carry over to the website and this will help motivate me to start writing more dvd reviews and content in general.  The site is called  urlLink DVDMON.com.   Although I could just keep writing ad nauseum, I think I'll end this first entry and see how this thing works.
Ack!  Tried adding something this morning and Blogger was down - my luck, of course!  I decided to put up a couple of links - email and my amazon.com wishlist.  The former seems pretty obvious especially since right now there's no other way on the way to comment or get in touch with me.  The latter seems to be somewhat common.  Last night me and Jessica (my fiancee) went to this  urlLink digital photography seminar  thing in Tysons Corner.  It was interesting, but we got there late and didn't stay for the whole thing.  But we did go a bit crazy and bought a bunch of dvd's - a subscription to a dvd magazine on photography and photographers, photoshop and painter tutorials, a guide to shooting weddings, etc.  I currently have close to 200 dvd movies and have been really b
