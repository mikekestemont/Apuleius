Hello to all of you, salut Ã  toutes :-)   First off, thanks to all of you who came for the  Movie & Martini extravaganza @ Kim`s . It was COOL. & Kim, thanks for having us. :-)  You Rock!!  I  loved  the videos. They really hit home on how women are so so so negatively portrayed in the ads.  As objects (and not subjects) of our own destiny.... The impact on us is phenomenal. 3000 ads viewed daily. In the next 10 years, you'll be seeing about ten million nine hundred thousand ads. 10,950,000. Most of them, i guess, women.    To continue our discussion on media & women, let's bring magazines to our next meeting. I'd suggested males mags but let's do that another time. I'll get a movie about that another time.   For now, let's stick to women's & girls to keep the impact going.  WHERE: Royal Oak, Laurier street (between King Edward & Cumberland street)  Time: Same as usual 7:30  What you need: 1 magazine. Yourself.    ;-) See you tuesday. Anne-Sophie
Thanks to Cynthia and Anne-Sophie for the awesome potluck last night.  The food was so delicious, I couldn't stop eating.  Well, I hope we didn't create too much of a mess.  See you fabulous gals on Tuesday!  Apryl  P.S. Sex and the City:  Feminist or no?
Bonjour les petites madames,  This time, I am all inviting you to the Collection, Tuesday, June 15, 7:30pm.  For the last few weeks, we have had a lot of fun discussing women issues, relationships, the impact of media, women role models, etc. But this time, I would like to propose something a little different.  First:  Each one of you should bring a baby or kid picture of yourself. Then, you need to present us a passion that you have, a book that you read, or an activity that you do and that the other girls don't really know about.  I think it would be a great way to solidify our bonds =)  By the way, the Collection manager told us he would do any Martini we want, who knows, we might even be able to negotiate a discount hihi!  Hope to see you all Tuesday and tonight (Friday) at our little potluck party.
