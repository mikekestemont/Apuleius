yo ... i smell too.
hi... I R eggvain... this is where I shall type out stuff in my mind... or stuff that just happens. Im fat. =]
I've been kinda burned out lately. It's just that I feel like I have too much to do. You see, on friday I went on a field trip to the Collage of the Canyons.(a community college in Valencia) THEY seemed less stressed out than me.  These are college kids! I guess because they actually get to CHOOSE what classes they want and when to attend. Why can't those of us in lower grades like middle school get to at least choose our class times? I can understand not choosing what classes, but I bet that plenty of teachers( as well as students ) would love to wake up at least an hour later. I know that I don't function well in the morning and would actually prefer a noon class so that I would  at least be awake for school. Now I find myself going kinda down in my grades 'cause( besides being under pressure to keep up my 4.0) I have been told that in my gifted classes, any grade that I get actually counts as one grade higher. so if I get streight b's, it would still be a 4.0 average. I'm willing to get streight b's, but I just feel a duty to myself to keep getting streight a's. That just is tearing me up bit by bit.
" I hate linkin park "  not me, it's just a quote from one of my friends. She can like manufactured pop, but not soulful, expressive, literate music? There are more of you out there. I bet not a damn on of you can give me a good, honest reason why. Anything that you can say to show me that linkin park is a bad band, I can turn right back around on you. Here's just a few examples:                         #1- LP sux because they set a bad example for our children w/ their bad words and hateful words.                                                                                         reply- y single them out? If they don't learn this stuff from a song they WILL learn this stuff from other places. And what about them is hateful? Excuse me, but is there not a war going on right now? Aren't there hate crimes going on?  Where do you think they will learn hate from? Not from these things and not from a band that they may not even understand the lyrics to.                                                                                         #2- they are only a good band because they are on MTV                                                                                         reply- You could say that for any band or artist dumbass!!!!!!    like I said, just give me a reason and I WILL reverse it! That is a guarentee. I cannot believe that some of you LP haters can bag on linkin park, yet like manufactured pop. Now don't think I am a hypocrate for saying that a certain type of music is bad. I unlike you freakin' LP haters DO have reasons for hating the songs.You want to say that linkin p
