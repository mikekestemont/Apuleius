Matthew   * * *  Well it´s not true, actually I hope one time my thoughts could be centered in one topic, but it has never been posible! For those who know AIESEC (are AIESEC people), well yes, to many of you I haven´t told, but I´m in at least one year more coordinating for Latin America (this is the Spanish Speaking Groth Network) three of the main innitiatives of the current plan. It´s bloody good stuff, it´s a piloting (well, many people don´t like the word piloting, so let´s say running for the first time) a position that has to become financially sustainable by its own in less than 6 months... well good stuff, or scary?  Well, there are always TRADE-OFFs for everything in life, important is that I feel passionate about the job, travelling cross Latin America selling regional products and therefore, explaining more than ever the power of the organization. Always wanted to do it at an international level, and seems that now I´m in!
Hi mates,  I just realized that is quite "fake" the way I have been handling my old  urlLink http://orianatorres.aiesec.ws  weblog ... actually I will keep using it (that´s why old is not the best way to name it), but for the same I´ve been using it till now, making kind of newspaper for friends that might be interested (or not) about what I´ve been doing lately.  Come on...I love writting , for those who really know me, they know I do, and I love to do it long, and detailed ...           Looking into my sent-mail folder, I realized that it´s high time not not only share the random, other times "rationale" but however always emotional thoughts that come to my mind, with the same 3 people. Actually I trust them a lot for doing it, but what is so bad to post freely what you thik?    And Bingo ... I managed to find this free bloging site (thanks  urlLink Santi  - http://santiagou.blogspot.com/,  I just saw you were using it).  Well also real credits should go to  urlLink Levri . Levri - ulli.typepad.com  also had a big influence in my way of perceiving (or actually using) blogs (and specially bloggers) and how money, true friends, and dreams can be made out of them. Once she asked to someone, what his key to sucess was, and this answered:  "I just did it through sharing my ideas"
