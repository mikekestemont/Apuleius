Well, I have done it, I have invented something that will make you happy with your diet and your weekly exercise plan.  All you have to do is grab a partner, preferably one you know somewhat well, and give them this low down.  You burn over 2000 calories in one 20 minute session of SEX.  Why has nobody thought of this before.  You can lose weight having sex all the time.  Screw Atkins, and screw your partner to a better figure.  Assuming that everyone burns the same amount of calories, all you need to do is have sex four to five times a day, and you too can have the body of a rock star.  You may be saying hey Libra dude, I only last like 2 minutes,  well if you keep at it, your member will be so raw, you will last forever, just ask my ex-roommate lil-rce.  Eventualy you will be able to last for hours pleasing your partner and also losing weight and toning those hard to reach areas, like your groin muscle, your back, your biceps and triceps, leg muscles, and countless others all at the same time.  Now I must stress this to the ladies and gentleman out there today, five times is just the minimum, do it as much as possible in the first two weeks or until you have your ideal body type, then work your way into a Sex-for-life schedule that suits you.  And remember folks I am not only the founder of this diet I am a member too, (just do not have a partner at this time).   Always your workout partner,  LoveLostLibra

SHREK 2  Shrek 2 is just as good, maybe better, as the original movie.  The humor is still there, plus of course the obligatory lovey dovey stuff.  I know it may be the romantic in me but this movie both tickles your funny bone and warms the heart.  I highly suggest this movie to all couples, or just lonely people, like myself, who want a good laugh at everything and anything fairy tale.  Your movie critic for the day  LoveLostLibra
Well this is only my second post, so I figured I would not have to go all out, still getting my feet wet and all.  I have been noticing though that a lot of the posts I read have been written to invoke some sort of thought amongst the fellow blogers that browse the blogspots.  It took me a long time to figure something to write down here that I think would invoke some kind of emotion, response, or just make people say, hmmmm.  With all that down then drain I figured I would just rant on something instead.  I seem to be very good at ranting on various subjects, although most of my rants end up twisting in upon themselves and m
