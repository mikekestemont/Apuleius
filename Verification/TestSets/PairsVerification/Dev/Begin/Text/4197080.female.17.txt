The crisp fall air whisked slowly across my face as I sat on a bench outside of Cape Elizabeth High School. To my right sat my friends Bryan and Melissa clearly making plans for the upcoming weekend that did not include me. It was like I had disappeared.  "...And maybe after we go to the movies we could meet a couple of people at Angie’s and order a pizza or something," Bryan said as he pulled out his cell phone.  "I don’t know about that. Portland is always really busy on Friday nights and..." as Melissa responded, I got up and walked towards the football field where the school’s grounds keepers were lining it and cutting the grass in preparation for the game against Westbrook High. I figured that I would go since I had nothing else planned.  Turning to head back towards the school to catch my bus I saw Ethan Graham, captain of the football team, pull out of the parking lot in his bright red Honda. Ever since we moved to Cape Elizabeth I had had the biggest crush on him. We had never really talked much and we only had a couple of classes together but my gut told me that he was a really nice guy. The kind that would hold the door open and pull out your chair for you when you went out. I do not know what it was; the way he smiled, his eyes, his sense of humor. There was something about him that made time stop stand still when he entered a room. As he peeled out of the parking lot, I sighed and kept walking.

I silently shook my head and climbed the steps onto the bus.

After a twenty-minute ride I was dropped off less than one fourth of a mile from my home at seven Hidden Creek Drive. Considering what we had just gone through with the loss of my father and with my brother going to college, we had a pretty nice house. It was two stories with an in-ground pool, two-car garage, and wrap around porch. Upon entering the front door you stood in front of the stairway that led to the second level. To the left was a living room that had a large screened TV and overstuffed furniture. If you walked across the living room you entered the dining room. We rarely ever ate there and it was mainly a place for fancy occasions and for Mom to show off all of the porcelain figurines that she had collected over the years. If you continued to your right you entered our kitchen complete with breakfast counter a
