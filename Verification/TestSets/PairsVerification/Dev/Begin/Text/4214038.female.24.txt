I don't know what the deal is, but lately all my chokers (necklaces) have been malfunctioning. My most favor-right, a tan intertwined rubber one, lost its clip a few months back. I kept it because I am thinking I can get it fixed for $5 ... though I have yet to do anything to it just yet. The second one, a beautiful one I brought while in NY the second time, from a beautifully complected Kenyan man, had short strings and yet, my thick-necked ass put it on ANYway and being the single, alone, no one to call my own female I am, I had no one to undo the knot and therefore had to cut myself out of it. It was quite humorous after getting over the "OMG! I might have to wear this choker for the rest of my life!" fear. So that one also needs to go to the shop. Problem is, finding the type of string to match the one already applied to the choker ... which prolly won't happen. We'll see. Most recently, my one with the suede ties snapped in the front! WTF?   There's a festival going on this weekend where I'm sure they will have African jewelry ... however, the problem lies in also needing groceries. Hmmm ... buy beautiful African art and jewelry or healthy food and sustenance? This will be a hard one. I've been anticipating going to this festival for the past two years, but something always came up or happened -- so I'm definitely GOING ... if I don't buy anything I'll slap myself around until NEXT summer.   I've had most of this jewelry forever, and jewelry is like underwear and socks, every few years you need to renew your stash. But, if you read the previous post (which you probably didn't because no one reads my blog ... and I'm OK with that) you know that I need to get on my shit as far as my eating habits go. Maybe I can trim down my grocery list to food that will last for the next couple weeks till payday and use the rest for African artifacts. Sounds reasonable enough.   I just LOVE being broke! Yay! Punk ass. ... *sigh* sorry ya'll ... a brief moment of frustration. I'll have a happy story to tell later. I'll make it good.   Peace.  ~*RBG*~
Last night I was slapped with a rude awakening. My skinny jeans barely fit! They were muy uncomfortable.   Most recently I have been hella depressed here being away from my family and without companionship, and I am guessing the Mickey Ds fries and deliberatley buyin the full of fat Hidden Valley Ranch to accompany my veggies instead of the low-fat option, that I was buying when I was more  disciplined, has come back to do war on my thighs.   I blame my father's side of the family. All of his sisters  are built like horses in the ass and hips. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate my junk in the trunk, but I also know my limitations.   I
