I'm in English right now & I'm supposed to be writing a paper but I don't wanna.  I'm really bored!
Lunch is over! THE BIG SEXY IS BACK!!!!!!!!! Me and Sarah realized that I've gone out with the boyfriends of all of the girls from lunch.  That's kinda weird.  Watch out TJ.  Just Kidding.  I wouldn't do that to Sarah Lee.  Someone really cool is on student council.  That excited me. I hope I get to go to prom next year.  That would be nice.
So that posted twice HAHA!  I have a blog.  It has green.  So Imet my fiance yesterday and wow! That's all I have to say about that.  Sarah's piano recital was somewhere in Green Bay and on the way home we ended up in Bellvue!  It was quite chaotic for a while.  She went the wrong way and we were lost for like ten minutes even though she knew where she was going.  Right.  I better get going.  It's Andy Randy's birthday.  He's old!  The only person who knows about this blog is Sarah Lee so Bye Sarah!
Richie comes back on Friday!!!!!  I'm so excited!

Oh yeah all the while we were getting drenched.  But yeah that dad needs to learn a few lessons about being nice.  Maybe he should watch Barney instead of the news cuz then he wouldn't be as persuaded by lies.  We just came over to say hi and he went off on us about how we better watch out because there's gonna be a draft.  Girls better watch out too because they're gonna be drafted too.

Then we realized, after we ate a pizza, that Kerry was going t
