One more birthday passed.. I'm 26 now. Feels scary. There is no more time to avoid responsibilities. No more time to ignore life happening.  Why am i so crouched inside? It's so hard for me to let out my thoughts.. It's hard to talk about happenings around me.. I can see clearly how much fear is covering me.. I am afraid of people around me. Afraid that they might find this secret chest and nail me on the cross. And this space on net is my secret chest.  Millions of people seek asylum here.. We run to each other running from people in our physical world.. It's really ironic.. I am attending one course for 4 days now.. Today will be the last day.. Well, this course is so enriching. Never felt anything like that. It's about art of living. It's about practical wisdom.. We had some workshops...I'll mention just one. You are sitting infront of one person and looking at that person's eyes for long time with full intention. And so you stare at each other's eyes very long. And then you hear voice saying: if God would appear to you right now in form of person across to you would you be able to recognize it? Would you be able to see it? And then all the world is just that person. You feel immense love for that pair of eyes.. you would move mountains only to see those eyes happy.. And you want to drown in those eyes. You see Krishna blinking behind them. It's amazing feeling.. And then there is this recognition of how beautiful we all are and how alone and hurt. And you keep asking yourself why is that? Why are we so big strangers with each other?  And answers are coming.. It's amazing how everytime when you have question from your heart you immediately receive answer. Maybe for first time i am able to see world from this corner.. Maybe for first time i feel safe but also responsible for my life.. Yes all is in my hands. I can really move mountains. I can also finish my studies.. I can reach my dear South Asia... I can play tabla if i want... I can smile throughout the day.. And i can trust people even if they hurt me hard.. As much as people can trust me..
Is it possible that we are just puppets on string?
Demons dance around me. Life came to collect it's part. Time for me to move some steps further. Am i really so bad person? What causes my actions? What is right thing to do? There is no savior, and that is the scariest idea.. There is no melancholy and sympathy in life..One more scary thing.. All this is only set for us to crush our egos and mental conceptions. Am i crushing it? I know i go towards the rock.. Seen it before.. I'm stuck to long in swamp of nothing.. my mind already stinks.. no fresh air in it.. I want to grow only. I want others t
