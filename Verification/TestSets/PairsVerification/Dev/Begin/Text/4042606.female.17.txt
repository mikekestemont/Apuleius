Well my plane takes off at 9:50 am tomorrow morning, so this will be my last post for a while. I am going to be in the air for 4 hours so I will have time to write some drafts of posts to come. Like I said earlier, Ian is going to take over some posting! Yay! He finally gets responsibility! Anyway, We are heading in early so I must finish packing, and I will see you all in a week!  Kisses for Marty and Ian
Well I guess Jackie was trying to get in touch with me all of last night. She finally caught me today after work. The South Park Characters, are not going to be up atleast until sunday. For some reason the website will not let me upload the files. I will crack the code and get those pictures up. Anyway, as for Jackie going to Tampa Bay, that is brand new news to me. So I guess it's up to me to update the website at the moment otherwise like Jackie said "Everything will be normal".
Well I finally got a hold of Ian, and I sent him the pictures. He said he was going to work out the problems while I am gone.

So, even though I will have my laptop with me, I probably won't be posting much so you'll have to rely on Ian for posts! Anyway he will probably post the south park characters later this weekend. Otherwise, things will be normal!
I am trying to make south park characters of me and Ian. But, at the moment the website won't let me post the pictures. The pictures will probably be up sometime next week, or whenever I get Ian's attention. He seems to be quite the little party boy, and is never answering his cell phone.

All of a sudden it starts raining, this is the second time this has happened to me this week. It is also starting to anger me, Hopefully the ground will dry up so I can go out and do what I originally intended to do.  On another note, I have a cell phone. On my cell phone I get charge a certain amount of money for the amount of minutes I use. Now that you understand this, let me say that I don't want to here about some dork starring at your funbags for fifteen minutes. I don't know how Jackie did it, but she was able to turn that one simple event into an hour long lecture about how I shouldn't stare at her boobs. I not only lost an hour of my life, but, I also lost money. Something I will never be able to get back.   There are somethings in this w
