I'm pretty excited today...I'm going to a party later, and it has a theme of "Pirates and Wenches", hahahaaha! I'm not sure I'm going to actually dress up (God knows I might end up looking more like a wench than a pirate, if my wardrobe is any indicator), but it should be heaps of fun! I'll post some pics up if and when I take them.  Meanwhile, the house is smelling of cookies 'cos my housemate Judi has just baked oatmeal ones: low-fat, low-sugar, high in goodness, she says. She should be a copywriter. Heheh. Judi and I were meant to go out shopping today, but I cancelled the plans...she wanted me to own a pair of "gay pants" - i.e. pants that are tight enough to "show off" (yeah, right) thighs, legs and butt whilst being simultaneously comfortable and fashionable. Everything I own is too  baggy , she insists vehemently and with a vengeance.  If you've got it, flaunt it!  she shrieks.   I don't got it. _____________________________  Meanwhile, five music clips still available for download! Check out the "Nick's Music" link on the right. Would appreciate it if you let me know what you think! Thanks!
Having gone to rehearsal yesterday (see previous post), I was very impressed with the strings players that my friend has sought help from -- they're really, really good, and they brought out a very nice sound to some of the stuff I'd written for them. If only there was a way for some of you to have a sample of my work...   Oh wait!    Well, guess what! I've managed to find a way to upload some demos so that you guys and girls may download them! Yaay!  So at long last, please check out some of my demos written for various projects. At this time there are only five, but I'll add more as time goes by. A disclaimer, though, is that these songs were all recorded using my keyboard with only my vocals on top (which aren't great); so bear in mind that they are only  demos,  which might contain mistakes, mis-tunes and mis-writings.  Okay, without further ado... please check out  urlLink My Music  for downloads! Also added it to the links in the sidebar. Cheers boys and girls!
I have been feeling a little homesicky lately, I'm not sure why. Perhaps it has to do with the fact that I've been in Perth since February without going home -- but that seems to be a rather pathetic reason, considering it's only been a few months, not a few years. And it's not like I've not been away from home for a whole year before -- I did it in 1999, when I was studying in Sydney. Still, I've been having dreams lately about being at home... and a couple of months ago, my dog died while I was here, which makes it  two  dogs in two years who've moved on while I was away. I dunno. I'm just in that kinda mood, I guess. Hopefully this will pass soon.  Anyway, onto brighter and c
