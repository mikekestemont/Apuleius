Thank you to a Steven Jalil, I'm at least intrigued for a night.  Anyway, folks, what should we use this team blog as?
lol, look at us!&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink
i updated some shit for the blog, and everyone should update this!  and while i m here, who's chillen on friday,sat, so forth?
Should we keep the colors? Looked the most original to me at the time
just trying it
I changed the name of Summer Romp to Jones' 18th B-day, and the second summer romp has become the first, and now  only,  summer romp. Not too confusing.    Okay, that's all for the photo gallery updates for a while. Oh yeah, and can whoever started this thing put a link to  urlLink  my  blog  on here? It just bothers me, is all.
Yes, Jorge, that would be horrible.   As for the chinchilla thing...well, I'd probably try dancing an irish jig.
NO NEED TO FEAR JORGE IS HERE... &nbsp; &nbsp;Sorry I haven't updated I've been to busy having fun ith your moms box dave...lol j/k that'd be horrible. Anywho...I have ntoing to say but I would say this... What would you do if you woke up with a chincilla in your ass?
Come on Jorge...you gots to post...  Not like there's a significant  reason  to, but...  Nevertheless.
Summer romp was acutally Jones' B-day....could be wrong though
Ok, quick little update on galleries  Firstly, can you have the names pop up for each gallery, either old gallery style or stupidink style, so people know which is which  and secondly, post up a list of all the missing pics so I can helloerize them for ya
If Jorge goes back out with judith, every single member of the original 5 krew member will be going out with someone, and not only that, but we all would have g/f's from antioch too. And, and, and...thats it. O, and you have to count rob out i just realized...just noticing
Check this out:
Those who wish to obtain the picture code would be wise to check out the comments of the last post.   As for this blog, I suggest that we use it for trivia and other random crap like that. Since no one will protest, I will start it off with some Simpsons trivia.   I'll start with an easy one.  Who shot Mr. Burns?
i guess this serves... some  inane purpose to someone...   I can't offer much in terms of MEAT to this group blog dealy, but I can offer the code I use to put that pic on my posts to people for their own use (and obviously, their own pics)...is anyone interested?
Okay, so maybe Rob and Andy were bad ideas (they'd never do it), but other people, IE Czank, Benny, etc. etc. The thinking behind this is that maybe with more people, we can actually find a real  purpose  to this thing.  Oh, and as for the Photo Gallery, well...too bad.
Unhappy was an understatement. Anyway, moving on  Gotta remember to link, and if you can figure out Andreas and Rob's emails where they won't delete things, by all means
We need to get a lot more people in this...Rob, A
