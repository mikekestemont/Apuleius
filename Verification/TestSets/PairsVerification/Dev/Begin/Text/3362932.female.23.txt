Hi there tristan! Thank god you're here really.. I was starting to feel like this might not work out at all. alright, quite serendipitously, while reading your entry, I was just teaching a friend on MSN how to upload a picture. so I'll just copy and paste the instructions here:  1. go to http://www.imageshack.us/  2. upload any picture you have from your files, click "host it", and you'll taken to another page. and the very last link, I think they call it the "direct link", you have to copy it to somewhere.  3.so let's say its http://ihresidents.jpg   4.you go to blogger, in your new post, you type whatever, and then in the space where you want the picture to be, you type     and we'll all be able to check it out.
Yo guys  Ok so i finally succeeded in joining this blog...thx to Kenny for the patience and thx to Sze Lynn for the idea, that's definitely cool.  Here's Tristan, live from Paris.  How're you guys doin'?  Life here is okay, but I'm studying like hell...I miss Sydney, where I can't remember having studied :-). actually that's not the only reason why i miss sydney...but enough nostalgia.  my masters is at the end of the road, in one month or sth. then PhD. I tried again surfing, one week in French West Coast. i suck. i should have taken more lessons in Bondi. but i will improve.  Now hot news : we met again with the Euroboys Crew&reg; last week (Jasper  aka  Jazz, Peter  aka  PP, Alexis, Christian and myself); they all came to my place and that was definitely a crazy week. as soon as I'll know how to post a pic, i will post the official group pic, taken in ... an aussie pub! (of course)  Ok, see you guys, take care, give some news, and may the Force be with you.  Tristan
