hey! i'm posting this from my car, while driving! technology rules.
i'm off.  never made it to sleep though. took 4 hours to get my shocks and struts installed! oh well...i operate better on a little missed sleep...usually.  if i don't post again later tonight then i probably didn't make it.
as i was relating to my seattle friend via msn messenger: i need to go and install my new shocks tonight, do all my laundry, pack incl. the computer i'm giving my fam, pick up gifts for my sister from my aunt's house, go out for beers, and get enough sleep to drive 14 hours straight tomorrow.  possible? sure is, i'm superman.
does  urlLink  this  piss you off too?  defending the nation is one thing...this goes too far.
why do all the girls i like have 'boy' baggage? seattle friend, 'boy' baggage. new friend, 'boy' baggage. friend from the summer, 'boy' baggage. arrgh!  on an upbeat note, looks like my new suspension is being delievered today so if i can get it installed this afternoon my drive up north will be super smooth!
my new friend seems to be having a problem with bf or is it ex-bf? i im'd her and she said, "hold on - i'm being yelled at". now that's a bit sucky. looks like she's going over the his house now to pick up her stuff. i don't think he's home though, in denver maybe? i'm trying not to pry.  i did some xmas gift delivery tonight. only meant to stop real quick and drop off the gifts but ended up talking for awhile. it was very nice, don't seem them very often anymore. was falling asleep in the car on the way home. how can i still be tired?
i think i'm finished with my shopping. didn't take me too long. i made a list, checked it twice. now i only have to wrap them.
i am so stuffed right now.  my seattle friend ended up getting christmas eve and christmas day off and is now able to fly back home for xmas. good for her! i didn't get to spend xmas with my family one year due to work and it sucked. i'll miss out on seeing her but i don't think she's changed since halloween.  i've compiled my list of things to buy this afternoon. should be in and out the the stores quite quickly. then i have to wrap them.  my new friend made it to the lunch gtg (previously not able due to being surgeries all day), her boss brought her (in his lotus, he's the doctor). chicks in scrubs. ooo baby.
ok, so i'm going to whine about work for a second. i just had a short meeting with my boss, who hails from iowa, about perceived start and end times of my work day. i'm a computer engineer and spend my day doing development and testing. as such, my work schedule is, how'd you say, variable. meaning i get into and leave work whenever i damn well please. when i was initally hired i asked about s
