So the weekend is on me again and since I am back to square one again I wonder what this one is going to be like. There is a party that I will most likely be attending but I honestly don't really even want to go. If by chance&nbsp; I find something a bit more interesting to do, I will probably cop out. Unfortunately I do have to work tomorrow at Hot Topic so I am not sure how late I will actually be out or if I will even get torn or not.&nbsp; Then again, I am not sure I can handle the party scene sober so the thought of going straight seems a little far fetched. I will be spending time with Vanessa which will most likely mean I will have to see and deal with f'n Tim too. I swear I get so freaking tired of seeing the f'er everywhere I go for fun. I swear sometimes I just want to stomp him into the ground just to get him out of my system and feel better about the entire situation.&nbsp; It probably would be in his best interest to stay as far away from me as possible otherwise things could get ugly.&nbsp; Honestly I think a lot of the frustration and anger I have for Mike (the f'er that used to be my best friend until he slept around with my ex-fiance on my own couch.. long story). Since Tim basically did the same thing as Mike they both stand in the same category to me anymore. Neither of them would be safe in a closed room with me alone because I would gladly stomp either one of them into the ground and not think twice about it.   If anyone knows me personally they would probably be thinking right now "What in the world is going on with Seth, he is not a violent person" Well, for the most part that is correct. The reason why I am normally not a violent person is because I do not have enemies, for the most part. If you do something bad enough to make it to my enemy list, then I feel sorry for you because I am really never going to be nice to that person again. In my life I only have two people that I would really consider to be my enemy and Tim and Mike are both of them. Both of them took perfectly good friendships and threw them back in my face. Neither of them cared about how I felt so why in the world should I give two flips for anything they think or feel. If I could have about 15 minutes alone with each of them then I would probably be fine and never have another second thought about hating them. Unfortunately, I have tried to be the civil one about the entire situation but all it has done is fill me full or rage and regret for not whipping their ass into the ground.   I am sure that one day I
