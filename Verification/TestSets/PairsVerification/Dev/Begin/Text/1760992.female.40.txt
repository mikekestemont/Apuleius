I'm 40 years old, female, single, working as a paralegal in a government office in a third world country, the  urlLink Philippines . I'm working on my law degree. Been working on it for the past ten years. Gotta have something to aspire for. At the very least, all my skills and persuasions lean toward the legal practice. Not that it's a tradition in the family. We have no lawyers in our family. We're mostly employees, eking out a living in this corruption-ridden economy, this much ballyhooed only-Catholic-country-in-Asia myth.  Obviously, I'm no big fan of the Catholic religion -- or of religion, in general. I'm spiritual, but not religious. For one thing, faith in this society is more superstition than anything. Admittedly, faith is blind belief, but to be uneducated as well as blindly following is too Spanish colonial for me. A large majority of the population live below the poverty line. Way below it and extremely uneducated. I live just a wee bit above this cut-off and know just a wee bit more than the average guy on the street. Or so I hope. After all, all that education hasn't really gotten me anywhere.  I'm moving into my own place -- or I've been trying to. I don't know where the difficulty lies. I've lived on my own before: rooms, dorms, an apartment. It's nothing new to me. However, I can't for the life of me understand why it's so difficult this time. Maybe it's because this time, it's a house, with a second floor and rooms upstairs, a downstairs and even an upstairs toilet and bath.  It's only a small affair, 42 square meters floor area. No yard. It's part of a row, townhouse-style. Very small houses, most of which have a second floor balcony, with grills out front, covering the ground floor bit of a terrace and the balcony. They're very charming, really. The owner is away in Dubai, another single woman working for her keep. Anyway, for the meantime, it's my house. It's in  urlLink Bacoor , a small municipality in   urlLink Cavite province, just outside Metro Manila .  Like I said, I've been trying to move in, trying to borrow a vehicle. My own car's too small for the wooden table, the ironing horse, the screen, the 21"-screen tv, the mini-compo, and my books. The other stuff I can load onto my old battered car. Note to myself: buy clothes iron, and new car. Hah! I wish!   Illegalities in Moving Furniture   Last Saturday, I picked up the  urlLink living room set made of giant bamboo trunks . It still looked nice, and still in one piece: a large piece and two small pieces. They wouldn't fit in the rear entrance ot the  urlLink jeepney  I hired. So the men tied the big piece and one small piece onto the jeepney's roof, with the other small piece tied to the handles of the rear entrance. It was such a strange sight: a jeepney with a piece of furniture hanging from its rear and some more slithering r
