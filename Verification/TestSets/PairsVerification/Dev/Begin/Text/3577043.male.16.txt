Hey...just to remind everyone...AGAIN...I'm leaving July 2nd.  Don't ask me to go anywhere...or do anything...or anything like that....I'm needed here.  Have questions...email me and I'll get back to you AFTER vacation.  I'm a bit MAD to say the least right now...but I'm not going to be available so don't try calling or doing anything for right now.  Josh...I'll take care of you before I leave.    For all of you other people...enjoy the month and try not to party too much while enjoying your graciously given freedom....
Here's the deal. This is stupid. Just put a filter up.  This law won't affect me but I don't want to keep going back to my credit card number or whatever will be used so my kid can go to games sites that might be blocked. The word 'porn' is funny cause you can think of so many things.  I get the picture of the 42 year old male wasting away with the Kleenexes of sperm layin around or the 18 yr old male who just got a credit card and can't get enough pussy. Get a life.  For one thing, if your kid is discovering this stuff, you're gonna be able to tell because it shows up on the  computer .  Then you can sit down and have the porn talk...it's kind of like the birds and the bees but he'll ask you why girls suck horse dick and how come people shove toys in themselves.  Anyways, this all goes back to the parents who should pay attention and not rely on some porn law.
References to God were ordered to be put back into oaths by a judge of the state Supreme Court.  Apparently, one judge took it upon himself to change courtroom procedure by taking God out.  If the judges fail to follow through with the court's request, they may be held in contempt of court.  In a quote, "Basically the judge swore in his own witnesses,"  ...  "I think this decision returns this court to the people instead of like a dictatorship of one judge."  He's got a point.  Good to have God back in our oaths.
Under Islamic law, a man can legally have four wives.   (I have a source if u wanna know where I found this.)

I don't know if this day is significant.  But besides Spider Man 2 opening with a four-star rating (WOO HOO!), let's remember the Muppets.  Incredibly entertaining puppets have never been so cool. Everyone post their favorite.  I am gonna have to go with either Fozzie or Kermit.  Although, I think I am a lot like Kermit mainly cause no matter what we'll both always be chased by a pig.
Last night was great fun.  Thanks for coming.
What does a female porn star and the White House have in common?  They both have a Bush-Cheney.
Hey you guys want a laugh...go see what's posted as a comment under the Spider Man 2 posting.  I don't know...might just be me but it seems to be pretty funny.
