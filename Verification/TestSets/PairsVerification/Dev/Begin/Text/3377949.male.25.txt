So I was bored out of my mind yesterday and decided to stop by the local cinema to catch a movie. That movie was  urlLink Van Helsing . If horrible writing, an incoherent plot, terrible acting, and ridiculous CGI special effects make a good movie, than this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I was holding out hope that I would enjoy this, seeing as how I've always had a thing for the old  urlLink Universal  monster movies, like "Dracula" and "The Wolfman". I thought it would be good, cheesy, popcorn fun. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Some films are so bad that you can't even laugh at them. This was one of them.   My birthday is coming up (June 3). 25 years old. A quarter of a century. The march to middle age begins in earnest. Here is my possible itinerary for my birthday weekend (for those in Halifax, contact my ass and join the festivities and  buy me booze ):   Thursday, June 3 : After work, go to Tom's, get Aglio E Olio (pasta with garlic, olive oil, crushed chilies, Parmesan), have several pints, reflect on the last 25 years of my existence. There is a slight possibility that I'll go to  Hell's Kitchen at  urlLink The Marquee  to see  urlLink Eugene Ripper . We'll see.    Friday, June 4 : See  urlLink Mark Bragg And The Black Wedding Band  at Stage 9, Halifax's newest live music venue. Be there. Buy me booze.    Saturday, June 5 : If the weather is decent, lounge around on the waterfront all day and swing by  Sackville Landing  to check out  urlLink Tumbleweed 4 , the all day, FREE outdoor rock concert.  urlLink The Spincycle Squared  are on the bill.  urlLink Alfred Remo  is a rock star. It's gonna be fun kids.
In the fine tradition of this blog (that's about 2 weeks old), I present to you the  Friday List !   Iain's Top Five "Beers Of The World"       urlLink Harp  (Ireland) - This is what Alexander Keith's would taste like if it was brewed by angels.    urlLink Corona  (Mexico) - Open the bottle. Add slice of lime. Drink. Repeat as needed. Have a siesta. Muy bueno.    urlLink Stella Artois  (Belgium) - You can't help but feel classy drinking this beer. Even the cans are classy. Top drawer.    urlLink Foster's  (Australia) - This is quite a good beer, in my opinion, but the best part is that it comes a these  huge  cans. True, by the end of the can, the beer is kind warm, but they sure look cool. You feel like Crocodile Dundee when you're drinking out of one of these bad boys.     urlLink Kronenberg 1664  (France) - This is a new addition to my drinking rotation, and it fits in quite nicely, thank you very much. Plus, I like the fact that there's a date in the name. I don't know why, I just do.       Any peeps in the Halifax area should swing by  urlLink The Planet  tomorrow to check out  urlLink Slowcoaster . If you see me there, b
