My Battery is running low, sometimes they say the darndest things (very true but must make 24 hrs!)
//stoppress-> urlLink photos  now posted After almost 24 hrs I feel an need to update. After getting up at 7am this morning I have had a great time ever since. After a long journey that felt like we could get lost at any moment wwe finally arrived at what looked like ground zero, well random field zero.. Laura's first words went something along the lines of   this is the end of our friendship  Everyone looked ready to kill me, including the other players. However after a briefing it all looked good and after game one everyone was into it a bit, a few more and we were hooked. Far too much happened to list but the best bits in no particular order are:    Storming with covering fire the village   Being in the tank! (kind of)   Running out of ammo and having everyone even random strangers offer bullets instantly   Seeing everyone love it    Everyone agreed it hurt a little but was more than worth it. A brillian day and didn't cost that much really....   Next up was the curry nearly everyone came (keith had to work). Ate drank and was merry (bargain booze run was largest ever) Was really cool and so glad everyone came. Turns out I cant do champagne (video coming soon from Willy) Then some of us went to Revolution!  In there we all danced like crazy (remembered why love Laura, she'll try anythin, I was so proud of her today, she is great). Had like huge circle dancing with people taking turns, almost entire dance floor joined in. Few drinks back at Laura's then me and Willy came back to watch battle Royale. AND I STAYED UP LONGER! FOR THE FIRST TIME!  Have to mention everyone who made it a cool 20hrs   Laura   Lenny   Kath   Graham   Willy   Jo   Andy   Mary   Emma   Keith     Oh and some of my favorite quotes:    Laura: If this was real I'd be alive - after not being shot for 5 games   Lenny: As soon as I'd done it I realised how entirley inappropriate it was - after farting   Laura: Can we leave if we don't like it, Marshal: No - During Briefing     I'm sure I shall be reminded about more things as we progress... Everyone have a look and comment please
CANT WAIT! nothing else to say.  Sorry...
This is a few days late, call it recovery time. Anyway last week I met up with Laura and two of her teacher friends for a quiet drink. A few shooters later and it was just that, a lot later. We popped in to see Keith DJing and he gave me what turned out to be a god send. The Mistletoe headband!.  After fending of seriously fat female chav who decided I should give her the head band as it made me look queer. I started the challenge for the night, a kiss from 5 women. It took a while to get 5 but this turned out to be a k
