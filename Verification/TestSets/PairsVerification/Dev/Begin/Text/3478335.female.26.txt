Blah..blah...blah...why are women so difficult to understand?  Sometimes, I don't even understand myself.   And if I can't do that, how are others suppose to understand me? :o(  Hmm....
My weekend would normally be spent with my boyfriend but this weekend, its going to be different.  My boyfriend is in Desaru, Malaysia with his colleagues for a weekend getaway and I'm left behind in Singapore lost for what to do.  I swore to myself last night that I'm going to make the best of this opportunity and spend my weekend the best I know how.  I'm going to start the Saturday with a jog and followed by Singapore Institute of Management (SIM) to pay for my school fees (*sigh*....the thought of spending thousands of dollars leaves my heart aching..this better be worth it) after which I'm supposed to head to Sunset Bay, Sentosa.  My favourite pastime is to frolick in the sun..not having to do anything..in my bikini reading my girly mags..enjoying a glass of cold beer...PURE HEAVEN!!!!  :P  And if I still have time in the afternoon, I'm supposed to catch Shrek 2.  Binge on all the junk food while watching the movies...popcorn..nachos...  But hey...I'm not sure how my plan is gonna work out.  As it is, I didn't complete the 1st item in my itinerary.  I overslept and didn't go for the jog.  Kekekekeke...oink..oink...such a pig, right? :D  Anyway, I'm crossing my fingers..and toes.  I hope today is going to be a lovely day!

How many times in your life do you wonder.."Gee..that girl is gorgeous and she has a good looking boyfriend and a cute dog and she has a body that is simply to die for..yada...yada..yada...I wish I'm her!!!"  If you feel this way, don't worry..there's nothing wrong with it.  Most women especially in their mid 20s suffer from the "Comparison Syndrome".    I confess I'm one of them.  My good friend is an amazing person.  She's only one year older than me and she has a husband to adore her and a healthy baby boy and a nice apartment, etc etc.  I envy her and I wish I'm in her shoes sometimes.  But fact is I can't..I'll never be her...I'll always be me.  Yes, I may not have a husband or a baby and I still live with my parents but at least, I should be thankful that I'm alive.  I can still wake up in the morning and think to myself, "I will have a great day today."  I can breathe in the fresh air and I can laugh and be merry.     Life is what you make of it .  There's no point in sitting down and going green with envy over others.  If you really want something badly, work hard and rest assured you'll achieve it.  Does this all sound like psycho-babble bullshit?  :O)  Nah....
What is it about the Euro Cup that has every Tom, Dick & Harry turning into punters?  Everyone will be glued to their TV screens fighting the zzz monsters to watch the l
