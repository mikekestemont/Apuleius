Welcome to your first lesson in GTK. In this lesson, we'll learn to make a simple program that displays the "Hello World" message.
Have you ever passed a member function to the Win32 API and wondered why the compiler kept bailing out on you? Well I did. D'oh! I really need to brush up on my C++ skills :(.  Apparently, non-static member functions have a secret  this  parameter which make them incompatible with the function signature required by Win32 callbacks.  This is set right by changing the function definition from  void FooBar  to  static FooBar .  Now I need a graceful way of resolving   error C2597: illegal reference to data member 'CNetDocDlg::alldevs' in a static member function

Lifted off the net &gt;&gt;   Go to  /usr/share/apps/switchdesk  and you will find files like Xclients.gnome, Xclients.kde so make a file for your chosen window manager and make it excutable. As for the contents of the  file, keep it similar to other Xclients.xxx   And now edit the file:   /etc/X11/xdm/Xsession   and check out the section that calls window managers and add a entry for your chosen window manager. As you will see this file actually calls  /usr/share/apps/switchdesk/Xclients.xxx    And now go to the directory  /etc/X11/gdm/Session  and create a new file having name of your Window Manager and for the contents of this file. You will find files like GNOME, KDE in the directory so keep the contents of the new file similar to those files, and make it executable.   And now simply restart gdm with command:   #gdm-restart   Another good source is  urlLink http://www.networksynapse.net/gdm.html
