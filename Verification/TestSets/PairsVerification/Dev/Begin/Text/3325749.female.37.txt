Well...to complete the very boring Friday. I've now gone on to boring Saturday.  cleaned up a bit...Dan (my bro) came over for a bit.  The rest of the day/nite was spent on the phone with chat buddies...one who even had me actually thinking about flying down to NM next friday.  This man is sooooo  fine.  He's a fireman.  I had my cam on for him today.  He loved it.  Wouldn't let me turn it off...lmao  Damn why do all the nice men have to be so far away :-(   urghhhhhh  Well not to much to say other then its day #3 no G2.  I will conquer this breakup and get over him.  I have to!!!  Mission...find man and get off internet to stop checking to see if G2 is online.  Going to watch sex in the city...woohoo...thrilling life I tell ya.  hooo hummm  G'nite  Kat
Well it's two days since I last spoke to G.  I miss him like crazy and can't stop thinking about him but I know I have to be strong this time.  So I'm filling my life with other men in my life. I didn't end up going out for drinks with W last nite.  He didn't call me till 9:30 and I just said..ah screw it.  He called again tonight and I didn't answer the phone. hee hee playing a man's game now :p  Today was an uneventful day.  Work was boring as hell.  I was busy helping the girls but damn I have such a boring job.  I need to learn my graphics so I can change to something else.  After work I went tanning (upped my time by a whole two minutes..lmao)  Looking pretty good if I don't say so myself.  Just need to get rid of this fat on my body.  After that I went to my favorite bookstore...walked around for a couple of hours bought a few magazines then headed back home.  Signed online and guess who was there. Nope not G  it was Kevin (in Iraq still)  You know that is one man that I will never understand but know that I will always love for some reason.  We go so far back it's not funny but I know he has a jealousy and anger problem so why do I get caught up in this trap.  Once again he was telling me how much he loves me and misses me.  blah blah blah. Told me about a race he's in at the ned of July and wants to fly me down to see him.  Said no strings attached wanted to make up for everything that had happened.  Hmmm ya ok.  Other then that it was a very borinnnnnnnnnnnnnnng day/nite.  I'm hiding online from all my internet buddies.  I just don't feel like talking to anyone right now.  My head hurts thats how confused I am.  I need some major changes in my life soon or I'm going to go stir crazy.  Why can't I win the damn lottery and pay off my bills and split this joint.  I'd leave and never t
