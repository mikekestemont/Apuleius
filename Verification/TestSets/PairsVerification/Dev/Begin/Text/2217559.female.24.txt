Okay, it's like 10:45PM, Jen's in the shower and I am waiting to go to some Halloween party. Guess we will see how fun it will be. I have had 5 heinekens and I am feeling all good at this point. Sometimes I think it is just easier to get out of things so i don't have to commit emotionally. I don't what the hell my problem is.  I just kind of freak when things get tough and feel the need to just run from it all.  I think Jason hit it on the nail today when he responded to my email about leaving on a cruiseship.  He said, "Why? Sounds to me like you are running from something."  And I thought to myself, maybe I am.  I ran from Houston to Nac-a-nowhere and then from there to Austin and now to Austin to somewhere out in the middle of the ocean.  Yet I do try and blame it on business- like the contacts i will meet or the moeny I will save to get Bella Rock and SLT off the ground.  Hmm. Who's reading this now? The thoughts roam through my mind like a television that won't turn off. Tomorrow night is Shane's party. We are supposed to go.
Whoopee! Okay, I got the blog/journal/diary idea from Jennifer after she created an AOL journal. So I did some research online and thought what an excellent tool to have for communication while I am aboard the cruise-ship.   Monday I have my final interview for the first lady position and hopefully I will land the job and move aboard Celebrity cruiselines within the next month or so. Yippee. So, I think this will be a great place for me to post my journals about things that are going on in my life, places I am traveling and people I am meeting.   Happy Halloween, by the way. I have no plans tonight or shall I say I have plans which consist of not really leaving the house. I just want to hang out with Jennifer and throw water balloons at little kids and maybe throw back some beers. Should be fun - sounds as entertaining as anything else. Lord knows sixth street is not where I want to be. I did that last year and that scene was too much for me. Not to mention hearing about the urban legend of the crazed HIV person stabbing people with syringes of blood on Halloween.  That story still gives me the creeps.   SL-T Productions is coming along quite well - for those of you who aren't familiar: This is a production company that I have started with two partners. We are throwing a large xmas party in December at an undisclosed location. We are super excited as we now have an advertising exec, promotions person, catering, sponsorship from local businesses - everything is coming together quite nicely! It will be difficult to leave as things pick up but I am hoping I can persuade people like my hottie friend Shelby to pick up the front l
