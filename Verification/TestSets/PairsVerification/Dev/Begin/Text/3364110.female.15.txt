Heya all! I'm really happy. I may be beginning to get a bit of a cold, which is lame, and I hope it goes away before Friday, but I'm happy, cause I love Pete, and I've done 2/3 of my history coursework, and I'm gonna do some english revision later, but for now I'm free and happy, and I'm a little bit tired, but I'm wonderful. Isn't it great when you're with someone, and all you can think about is them, and you love them so much you can't describe it, and you want to spend the rest of your life with them? Yeah, it is.  Pete's coming round on Friday to revise with me and Jess, yay!
At the balloon festival today, every minute I wasn't almost on the rides I was thinking about you. I can't put into words what I feel for you, I love you so much. This is so different to what I've felt in the past. I just get so overwhelmed by my feelings for you whenever I think about you, I just... Want to be with you forever. I love you.
I feel so happy. I stayed up for a while texting Pete last night, and at about 12.20 I said nanight and turned off my phone. I woke up this morning to find my KORG brochures had arrived, wooyay, and I turned on my phone, texted Pete, only to discover he'd texted me twice since I'd turned my phone off. He's texted to say "I can't stop thinking about you, is this normal?" and "I love you Sarah".  ...  *beams with happiness* I love him...  We get on so well, and he's just perfect... *sighs dreamily*
I'm so lame... :-(  Oh well, Pete'll be online soon one would hope. Lalala, I'm really happy :-)
*sings* For once in my life, I've got someone who needs me, someone I've needed so long, for once I can go unafraid where life leads me, somehow I know I'll be strong!
I'm going out with Pete... :D  *dances*
I have a glass of orange juice. I haven't drank orange juice for about a year, how sad. I love orange juice. Well, I don't LOVE it, but I can bear it and it's healthy. Delicious and nutritious, some would say.  I wanna buy a CD this weekend... I have enough money to get two. Yay. I may just treat myself!
Pete was texting me about something really important and he ran out of credit and it's 20 minutes until I can phone him, ah no!!!!!!!!
Ahoy there landlubbers. Yar, tis I, yer good ole Cap'n Sarah.  I'm bored.
EEEEEEE TOM KNOWS NGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  How amazingly cool...
Wheee. I'm tired, I'm bored. I'm transcribing and improving my minimalist piece, just like Mr Wood said. Later I'll find out scales in 3rds and 6ths and 10ths like Debbie and Nick said. Afterwards I may even do some electronics. Or I could leave the minimalism, seeing as that won't take too long at all, and I could quickly get 3rds, 6ths and 10ths done, and then work on my electronics. That s
