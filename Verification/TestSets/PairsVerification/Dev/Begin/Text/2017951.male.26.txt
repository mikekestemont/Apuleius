Kerry has been to Milford Sound 31 times as a bus driver and only twice before has he experienced a similar perfect day. It rains two out of every three days so we were lucky. To visit after heavy rains is a totally different experience; waterfalls suddenly form from high up in the mountains and drop tremendous heights to the sound. The captain of Milford Sovereign pointed out the error in the naming of Milford Sound. A sound, in geological terms, is a river formed valley whereas Milford was formed by glacial movement which is known as a fjord. Click  urlLink here  for a better explaination.  Anyway, Milford Sound in the winter sun was startling. We had a rare sighting of bottlenose dolphins as we started our cruise. The sheer cliffs that rise vertically from depths of 700 metres below the sea could make for some of NZ's tallest mountains if height was measured from se
Te Anau was our base to Milford Sound, just a bed for the night. It was the only hostel that I've been in that has single rooms as standard meaning not putting up with anyone else's snoring and being able to fart freely and as loud as you want without thinking.  The route leaves the mountainous region of the Southern Alps and slowly changes into grazing hills of sheep, cattle and deer. We stopped off in Colac Bay for a fish & chips lunch then drove to McCrackalls point for a last sighting of the alps stretching north from the southern ocean. The drive to Invercargill (described by Mick Jagger as the arsehole of the world) took a further 30 minutes.  Tomorrow we're gonna go to the southern most point of NZ, watch the penguins come to shore around tea time then head to Dunedin.
I'm off to Milford Sound this morning. It is meant to be absolutely amazing on a clear day and totally pointless on a cloudy day. Lets pray for the former. The drive there is meant to be stunning too but somehow I think I will miss that as farewell drinks last night went on until 2am and my bus picks me up in about 10 mins at 7am.
The bus dropped me off in Wanaka today. It continues on to Queenstown so I'll be catching the next stray bus on Monday. Hopefully they'll be people on that bus who I got to know but got off at various points along the way. The bus stopped off at Puzzling World just before Wanaka. It's quite a cool place where there's lots of optical illusions and mindbending puzzles to puzzle over.    The three of us who were dropped off in Wanaka walked back in the afternoon to complete the maze. You have to find the four towers in each corner then get to the exit. We made a bit of a game of it, Kathy won even though I cheated at one point.    Brendan and I were going to watch the rugby, springboks vs All Blacks but I've been uploading photos for the last 2
