With the field combined, and 4 or 5 Quad guys in attendance, we should have had a good chance for a win or at least a good placing . . . I was incognito, as I was wearing my old Team Laure long-sleeved skin suit, so no one really knew who I was, let alone any guys on the team who may have heard of the *other* Wa[y]de, but with about 6-8 to go, after watching and moving up and down throught the pack for 25 or so laps to see what my team-mates were up to, I chatted with one or two to let them know they had some strength in their numbers, and although one was pretty tired from his efforts from the previous day, they could win the field sprint (there was a 3-man break that went off early and got as much as 40 seconds at one point). Now the BRC guys who were at the race are the very same guys that we all see at the weekly TRAINING race, and they go to the Wednesday Smack-Down, but don't race much beyond that for whatever reason. As a team of racers, we have an advantage . . . the Quad team RACES together. With a little effort and pulling together and learning what to look for in a race, where to hide when the going gets tough, and what to do in the final 5 laps of a crit would be extremely helpful. The guys at the race today did a great job as individuals, but some good team prep would have gone a long way.   Right from the gun, a few guys went off and gained a gap - with one BRC guy helping drive the effort. I launched to bridge, taking a BRC guy with me for a lap, but he wouldn't work cause "he had a guy up the road" though didn't think that we also had a gap (maybe only 5 sec's), and when he recognized this, he agreed, but died soon there after in the wind up the small rise on the course, and I wasn't going anywhere by myself in those conditions in my first real effort of the year. I dropped back to the field and the BRC guys swarmed the front . . . wasn't this a training race - don't these guys want to get any better? I guess they race only one guy at a time . . . I wonder how they decide . . .? They had too many guys taking it easy at the front of a race with no prize money and they had to pay to enter just like everyone else - that's fine for a real race, but c'mon . . .    I hung out near the front moving with the field as it accordianed back and forth, and I closed down a small break with 6 to go and started telling Quad guys to move up toward the front - to position their strongest guy for the finish -
