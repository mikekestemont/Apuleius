while in college i interned for a year or two writing film reviews for an online publication called American Dreamer. i was ecstatic to find myself and my reviews in amongst the rabble and rabble-rousers at Rotten Tomatoes. i was even more thrilled to find that i could Google myself and come up with pages listing my reviews or references to my reviews.  in the years since American Dreamer has essentially been dismantled, i haven't written any official film reviews, even though i've continued to see dozens of films each month, mostly via free advanced screenings.  enter the wonderful world of blog.  rather than insert film reviews into my personal blog ( urlLink Shades of Gray ), i chose instead to create a blog dedicated solely to my cinematic opinions. feel free to leave comments, but know that this site isn't really about what you think.  it's about what i think.
some people believe that there are angels that watch over us. Alim's angel isn't really an angel, but he did play one in the movies.  Alim (played by Jimi "THE GURU" Mistri) is living the gay life in London. well, literally. he lives with boyfriend Giles (Kristen Holden-Reid) and things really couldn't get any better. except for the fact that his devout Muslim family living in Toronto has no idea that Alim lives outside the closet. (they never knew he was in there to begin with.) and did i mention that he has an imaginary friend? actually, his friend is (or  was)  a very real person. after his mother left him to be raised by his aunt and uncle, Alim found friendship with the spirit of Cary Grant (played by Kyle "SHOWGIRLS" MacLachlan); a friendship that continues to flourish.  the upcoming nuptiuals of his cousin have Alim's mother Nuru (Sue Mathew) thinking it's high time that her son gets married. Alim has declined to attend the wedding, so on impulse Alim's mother hops a plane to London and drops in unexpectedly on Alim and Giles. with the help of Cary's spirit, the boys put on the farce of first pretending to be roommates and then that Alim is engaged to Giles' sister, but the truth will out eventually, and then it's just a matter of picking up the pieces.  though not quite the oldest story in the book, it has its familiarities; someone wishing for all the trappings of a film romance without actually realizing they're in one. the dialogue, though not strictly in keeping with the bedroom farce repertoire, is fresh and witty. (for example, Alim: "Can you believe it? She still keeps plastic on the furniture." Cary Grant: "Yes. It keeps the evil fresh.") MacLachlan's turn as Grant is a delightful imitation of the screen legend and Holden-Reid is charming, but Mistri's performance is stiff and somewhat strained (and not in a good way).
it's spring, and couples are becoming as numerous as those cicadas Jen tells me are continuously dropping from the sky in DC. walking home from a cafe today, i followed a couple for about three b
