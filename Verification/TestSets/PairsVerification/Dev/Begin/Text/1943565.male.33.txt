I am now emotionally scarred.     THOSE OF YOU WHO ATTEND THE AS-YET-UNDISCLOSED-BY-NAME-YET-TERRIBLY-EVIDENT-BY-INNUENDO COLLEGE THAT I WORK FOR ...do NOT eat the Cool Ranch Doritos (TM) in the Kava House.   They have no flavor.   Two people -- plus me -- have all opened separate bags, and have been psychologically damaged by the absence of Cool Ranchy goodness.  These are, simply, naked and flavorless corn chips.  Sweet Canadian Mullets...what the heck will happen next?!?
Sleep.  I remember this theory.  It was a good one, at one time.  As it stands now, I think I'm getting it in three hour (or less) increments.  I don't think it's scientifically possible at this point for me to sleep more than three hours and four minutes at a stretch.  This is, logically, followed by me getting insomnia for a good half an hour before I conk out again.  Rest is for the weak.  I acknowledge it not.  -- and no, it's not due to unnatural caffeine ingestion.  I didn't drink any coffee products last night.    Part of the problem (I believe) comes from the fact I'm   not   taking my medication right now.  Now, before I am burned in effigy, it's because I was asked to see if I can keep from doing so before I take yet another return trip to the Friendly Neighborhood Neurologist, and they run another shiny, happy series of tests on me to see  what in the name of Xanadu  is wrong with my head.  So, Sonny has unnatural pain in his noggin (including, but not limited to, a scalp that is so tender that it hurts to wash my hair) and this makes the resting on the pillow to be an accomplishment in and of itself.  Feh.
It's been one of THOSE Mondays;   I'm   not my biggest fan right now.  I'm just taking the attitude the rest of the free world has adopted -- apparently, I got "666" tattooed on my forehead last night or something...so, come on!  The game is called  Pile on Sonny !  I shall now go and seek therapy through caffeine.  Of  course , my bloody espresso machine WOULD choose this weekend to completely, utterly, and unfixably break (as in, knobs --  PLURAL!!  -- fall off at random).  Now I must buy another before I am comforted.  I'm tellin' ya -- it never rains.  It pours.  This.  World.  Blows.  When's the train for the next one?
Good Lord, but some of you people are bloody impatient.   "Sonny, where's the latest news?"  "Sonny, where's the love gone?"  "Sonny, have you seen my shoes?"   Forgive me -- sometimes this job thing of mine takes hold and eats away my time.    Like today.  It's Monday, ergo, one must contend with the madness of the previous weekend.  However, there   was   no madness.  All flash, no crash.  Not that I'm COMPLAINING, mind you...it's just that this means I get to spend multiple hours digging through paperwork.  My desk is now clean.  -- okay, "clean" is not the best descriptor.  It's "free from a lot of random crap being piled on top of it."  Better?    ******  I
