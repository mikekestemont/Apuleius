"Thank you, have a nice day."  Its my last week of work.  I'm pretty excited.  And a bit sad because I have had so many good experiences there.  It's so cool.  1.) A female coworker was hitting on me.  It was cool.  She was about 20-something.  I was talking to her on my break and she asked me if I wanted to buy her lunch or something.  I didn't know what to say really because I didn't feel interested in her in anyway.  I just kinda stammered and made a silly excuse in which another coworker came and saved the day.  After that, we just became friends.  We talk a lot and I did have lunch with her oneday.  It was a lot of fun.  2.) Jonee goes to our school.  She's a cool kid.  I like talking to her too.  3.) DISCOUNTS+++.  I bought my uber cool MP3/Radio/CD player there.  And a few CD's.  And a few video games.  Discounted.  Which was cool.  Oh yea, I also bought some food there too.  4.) Hm...A guy hit a on me.  That was interesting.  But I was not in the mood for some ice cream with him so I declined.  5.) A couple of nights ago, two lesbians came into my lane with stuff.  I was checking them out when one of them said, "I don't know why we have to use condoms.  Aren't we lesbians?  Why do we need condoms."  "Shh...you'll corrupt the poor kid."  "Don't worry, he's probably seen tons of lesbians, right kid?"  Yea, it was interesting.  And then when they were done,   "Don't mind her, dear.  She's not too tightly wrapped."  "Yea, and you're vagina isn't too tight anymore either."  Too much information, right?  Well, anyway I think there were women condoms.  There's such a thing, right?  6.) $$$$+++.  I finally have a MAC card, which is pretty hot.  And money to go with my MAC card.  Which Alex Manzi is so jealous of, even if he makes fun of me for it. "Oooo...look at Dennis with his MAC card and his memorization of his Social Security number.  With his driver's liscense.  OO....isn't he so cool?"  7.) MISC, ETC, whatever.  I need to find a new job.  Who wants to come with me.
I should be doing my homework right now but I'm currently in a state that forbids me of any feeling resembling "worry" about homework.  It's just the dumb packet for Kobyrinski.  I think I am like a rollarcoaster fueled by overthinking.    It seems that more and more, I am in a world my own.  Not really paying attention to the things going on around me and acting strange to people.  I analyze things people do and things they don't.  I'll ask myself that if I had done this, would people like me better?  I'll get pissed off at people for things I would never normally get pissed off at.  I'll see things differently.  One minute I'll feel sorta happy and the next minute, I'll feel angsty and against the world in general.  I am never d
