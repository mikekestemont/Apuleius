The other day on the way home from work, my daughter, sitting in her car seat in the back, says to me,  "Mommy, cut that light out!"  I look back to see she is pointing at the sun, squinting her eyes. I laugh and reply,  "Mommy can't turn that one out!"  She looks puzzled and starts singing along with the radio.&nbsp; Instantly, her attention was elsewhere, the sun forgotten.&nbsp; Children are such miracles, tiny beings of love and intellect sent to earth to teach us the meaning of life.&nbsp; I look at my daughter again, bobbing her head to the beat, and am taken aback by her trust and faith in me.&nbsp; To her I can do anything, soothe her scars, present her with sweet treats, rescue her from whomever or whatever is going to "get" her as she says, and even put out the sun!      How she depends on me!      What responsibility!  &nbsp;I would like think that her very existence depends on me but sometimes I'm not too sure.&nbsp;I think of the mom who left her 2 year old&nbsp;daughter alone in their apartment for something like 20 days. When the police found her, she was sitting in front of the TV naked, having eating all the food in the house that was within reach, including uncooked rice and spaghetti noodles.&nbsp; That mom should be burned at the stake.   I think about my own  mother  and cringe. There are too many unknowns. Where is she? Who is she? Why did she leave me? Is there ever a good answer to that question, Why did you leave me? Motherhood is a big responsibility and to just walk away from it like your child doesn't even exist is a different type of evil; infant sacrifice, throwing it into the gaping jaws of an unkind world.   We prepare to go out, I open the door to exit the apartment. My daughter comes running with her doll or her crayons and coloring book or her juice cup whatever she can see to grab. She looks up at me with her gigantic brown eyes,  "Don't leave me!"  My heart skips a beat, the words stab at my very soul.&nbsp; I manage to speak,  "I'm not leaving you. Come on, let's go."  She runs past me out onto the landing and turns to wait for me at the top of the steps. Her expression is one of puzzlement again. No doubt she cannot figure out why mommy has tears in her eyes.
I have eaten, within the past two weeks,   4   watermelons.&nbsp; Now for someone who rarely ever touches the stuff, I find this amazing. I have fallen completely in love with the ripe, red, sweet, juicy goodness.&nbsp; I love the way it feels when I pop a chunk in my mouth. . .&nbsp;cool&nbsp;flesh collapses between my tongue and the roof of my mouth. . .&nbsp;there is a crushing sound as the sweet juices gush out .&nbsp;. .then I start in on this rhythm of chewing and sucking, chewing and sucking, chewing and sucking. . .
