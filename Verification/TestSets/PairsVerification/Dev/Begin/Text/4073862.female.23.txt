this morning i woke up at 11:30am or so.  younok's cleaning lady was here and she was super nice too...i should just say that EVERY person i have met is incredibly nice and helpful and i'm sure every person will be so i don't have to type that anymore.  anyhow, youngok and i have bad jet lag, so we just lazed around for a while then went grocery shopping.  there is a new beautiful grocery center with a nice food court and starbucks right by her condo...instead of having super high aisles with huge boxes of food, they have like 6 foot ailses made of black wire, kind of like closet organizers and on these shelves are small bags of noodles, sauces, everything.  it's really cute actually!  and they have so many free samples!!  i love it here!  i bought some food and youngok and i ate some really good chinese food at the food court.  where she lives is comparable to the gold coast in chicago, so everything is kind of expensive but very nice and clean and new!  then we came back and lazed around some more and ate some fancy cakes we bought at that bakery where i dropped the tongs.  they had free samples too...i learned that free samples are kind of universal, no matter where you are in the world, you can still understand what is a free sample and what isn't...but the used toothpicks aren't thrown away, instead they are put in a small tray right next to the fresh ones.  one is in red writing and one is in black...i just have to remember which is which when i'm on my own...oh well..i'll remember later.  thanks for reading!
i was so tired on this flight...i sat next to a really nice man who was from canada on business and told me how i should get into stock anaylsis because then i could travel...pretty good idea i thought.  to bad i forgot math and hate to read.  this flight had the best food, sushi!  and you know, i probably should have questioned all raw fish that i ate, but since my stomach was okay from that other sushi in tokyo, i thought i would be fine.  you can't have fun unless you try i think!  or get sick... hey!  youngok's mother just brought me yello melon...it's like honey dew and cantelope mixed together and looks like a giant cucumber.  anyhow, i slept hard core on this flight and woke up to the painful pressure in my forehead from the landing...i'm sensitive to change in pressure for some reason...but it's fine when i land, so no big deal.  anyway, i got off the plane and waited in a HUGE line for customs...i was glad at this point that i had already gone through all that trouble before becasue i got into korea with no problem...ha ha, suckers...just kidding, i'll probably get deported next month...  and there waiting for me was the very kind and generous J.H. Kim, youngok's father!  he held a sign on it with m
