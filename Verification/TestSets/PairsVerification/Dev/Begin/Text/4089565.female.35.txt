Well, we went into town shopping today, and did our custmary stop at the DQ.  I really, really wanted to get a Medium Chocolate Dipped cone.  Instead, I got a kid-sized vanilla cone, and it really was just as good.  DH found some junk candy, you know, those boxes like you get at the movie theater,  for 98 cents  at Walmart.  You would have thought he found the Holy Grail! LOL  I didn't even look at what all they had, surprising since I love candy.   On the way home DH  were talking about my wanting to lose this weight.  I imagine this extra 68 pounds won't be too good for me down the road, and that I better get a handle on it now rather than later.  I have been lucky so far, to not have any weight related problems.    I told him that I want to be able to walk into a room and not look for someone fatter than me so that I can feel better about myself.  I do that alot.  As a matter of fact, that's the first thing I do when I am in a social setting.   I even compared myself to the women at DQ today, as I noticed one of them had an enourmous "bootie shelf ", and found myself wondering if I were that fat.  Shameful behavior for a grown woman. (But the answer is no, I wasn't bigger than them..LOL)
urlLink    Me with my mother June 04. I definitely inherited her body type... And lifestyle. Time this girl eats right and exercises!! (That was about me mom! You can do whatever you want..)  Like mom, up until now, I have lived a very sedentary lifestyle. I was never taking time for myself, and never paying attention to how much I was eating.
urlLink    Me, with my father, the 58 year old running machine. Taken June 04  Dad, dear Dad.  Always getting slack because he always talks about how fit he is and how much he runs.  Dad takes time for himself and eats right.  He puts himself on project status.  His wife Mary runs with him too..
Tuesday 7-27 15 minutes on the treadmill  Wednesday 7-28 30 minutes on the treadmill  Thursday 7-29 30 minutes on the treadmill  (made the decision I better vary my exercise with all that crap I have....)  Friday 7-30 WW Fast Track DVD..30 minutes..  Took Sat and Sun off, felt like a sloth for it though...  Monday..8-2-04 Holy Cow!!  Did Richard Simmons "Sweat and Tone" 30 minutes (after driving all over creation looking for an exertube to use with it.  I swear, those things used to be all over the place!  Finally found one at K-mart, only to return it the next day as it was the "strongest Resistance" one out there, and I couldn't use it! Wimp wimp!)  Then, after dinner that same night, I felt like walking... I went 1 1/2 miles in 27 minutes.  That's it, my first week done!!
