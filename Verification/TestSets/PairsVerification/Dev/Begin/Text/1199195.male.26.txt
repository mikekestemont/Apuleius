A bee, doing bee things. Took this on that same trip to Los Angeles as the city shot in the previous entry.   I'm having a litle issue lately where I put things on the roofs of cars, only to forget them and have them fall off and smash or fly off into oblivion while driving. How, you ask, can one put something on the roof of a car and forget about it in the scant seconds it takes to get in? Your guess is as good as mine. I'm now on cell phone number 3 on account of this flaw. Several years ago, my gf and I were contemplating getting cell phones. I told her she didn't need one, that she'd just lose it. I know I told her that because I've heard it every day since I lost the last phone. lol. I'm pretty sure it was a victim of the roof, but I can't say for certain. About a week ago I was at an accident and when I was getting back into the car I put some things on the roof as my hands were full. I then went ahead and drove off, phone still on the roof, wondering where it could possibly be. I feared the roof had claimed it, so I drove back to the spot where I'd been parked, and just as I turned into the parking lot, off it flew, my precious phone. It got wedged between the roof and the lights, which had cradled it gently until I turned the corner.   About a week after that, hands full once again while climbing into a car at work, I put a PBT (portable breath test) on the roof and drove away. It went flying off at about 40mph, crashing to the ground, case flying open, batteries and parts everywhere. lol. This was bad, cos it wasn't even my stuff on the roof. It was a 200 dollar device that belonged to my employer. So, doing what any guy would do, I jammed the batteries back in, duct taped it up, and off I went. It still turned on, but being that I wasn't boozed up, I had no way of determining if it still worked. I intended to leave a note or something about breaking it, but forgot about the whole thing until a day or two later when my supervisor called and asked if I'd smashed it up. Oh yeah, PS, I broke it. He was trying to use it on someone and didn't seem pleased. lol. Oh well.  So, the roof seems to have claimed my cell phone too, which isn't so bad because my dad has 2, and he gave me his Nextel to replace mine, cos he never uses is, but what a pain in the nuts it is not having any numbers in it. I had about 140 direct connect numbers in there, plus a ton of regular phone numbers too. Now when I get to work every day, I have to re-store everyone that I'm going to b
