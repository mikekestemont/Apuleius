I’m feeling subdued today. It was another “party weekend” and while it wasn’t quite as crazy as last weekend, it was crazy enough and I had to spend some time replaying the day’s events, checking them over rather gingerly to see what, if anything, I had to be embarrassed about.   I met my upstairs neighbor at 9:00 Sunday morning to go watch Denver’s gay pride parade. The parade was okay, a little longer than I preferred to stand, but the weather was cool and slightly overcast, and the people watching is always good. After the parade we headed down to the “Pride Fest” stopping for three or four beers on the way. It was only 11:00am, so I was feeling a little nervous about drinking too much. We stayed at the Pride Fest for several hours, drank a couple more beers, and then my neighbor suggested that we head over to a local bar for their Beer Bust -- $7, all you can drink. Another perhaps not-so-good idea. I suggested that we swing by our building first, I could’ve used a shower and a chance to check my phone messages, but my neighbor wanted to go to the bar right away, and so we did.   I’ve noticed before that my neighbor has a tendency to forget his money, or at least to forget which pocket it is in, and this happened while we were paying to get into the bar. His cash was misplaced long enough for me to buy the entrance tickets for the two of us, and then he really couldn’t break his twenty. He also has the disconcerting tendency to suggest to total strangers that perhaps I’d like to buy them a beer, or a bratwurst, or that I find them attractive. This can be funny for a very short while, but I don’t like it. I don’t like making fun of people, and that’s what this feels like. It also feels like he’s making fun of ME. I haven’t spent enough time with this guy to know how to react, yet, but from now on I’ll just calmly tell the person involved that whatever they’ve been told isn’t true, very sorry. Maybe that will stop him. Assuming I go out with this guy any more.   Before I knew it, it was getting close to 9:00. I’d been pacing myself, but I’d still drunk more than I intended to. I was feeling guilty about the fact that a friend of mine, who drives down from Summit County most Sunday nights, was probably waiting at my place. I told my neighbor that I had to go home, and suddenly he was inviting two strangers to come back to my place. I know he just wanted a ride home, and I also knew that he would most likely head back to his place, leaving me to entertain two strangers, so I put my foot down. “If my friend is at my place” I said, “it’ll just be awkward and not fun. You can invite people back to your place, b
