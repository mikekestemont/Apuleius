And finally the speech for the day.. Then Hang announce the opening of the 'fun fair'.. Thought that he going say 'Let the ffeast begin'.. But he didn..  Anyway.. Started to walk and walk.. Walking aimlessly around the school.. Wat a waste of time..  Then went up to see performance.. Some of their singing extremely awful.. Warrick should have gone there to sing.. Haiz.. Finally.. the thing ended.. Spared my life after all.. Went back to Pri school.. Found no teachers..  Went home then..  Ate lunch.. Then stumbled onto bed.. Slept til 3+.. Went to bathe.. Then went to library..  Went home around 6.. Took dog out.. Ate dinner.. And here now typing.. Very bored sia.. No one talking to me now.. Haiz.. Gtg soon.. Byebyez.. Tc.. my frienz..
