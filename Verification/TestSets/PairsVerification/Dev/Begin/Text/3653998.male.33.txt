What a weekend, it's finally over! Not often when you're wishing your weekends to end unless you're working through them. I got a complaint from an unidentified source that my blogs are too medical-- tough beans! I'm a doctor and have no life so deal with it. This is my blog damn it!--Just kidding J in San Fran.   Saturday was a bummer. The minute I stepped into the hospital, they brought in this 19 year old kid who got electrocuted when his ladder made contact with it. They were in the middle of doing chest compressions because the jolt caused cardiac arrest. He had no chance thereafter-- sobering. Made me think of my wife and child a little more who were both spending the weekend down in Staten Island getting good home cooking. I sure missed them. I found myself looking forlornly at a picture of my daughter rhj wishing i could hold her and hug her.   I hope the picnic was fun, sorry we missed it. Would have been fun.

Ok, so I have some time to kill so let me tell you about yesterday. So my wonderful wife decides to go to a Madonna concert leaving me alone with the baby for 6 hours. By in itself it wasn't so bad.

Well, it all started OK until some blockhead of a guy started hitting golf balls by tossing it in the air and trying to hit it like a baseball. I reprimanded him and told him to stop in fear that one of those golf balls could carom off the wall and hit Rennie. Well, the fricken oaf didn't even apologize and told his girl who he was trying to impress "well, at least I didn't punch him out."  Nice buddy, hitting a guy holding a little baby- takes a lot of class. I must say that I should thank the ladies that were there with us SC and Sun who cared for Rennie while DC and I tried to prove who was the better driving range pro. Well, in my exuberence I forgot the diaper bag and all its trimmings at the range. Thank goodness, my friends had more presence of mind to pick it up for me and bring it home to safety. I felt so stupid after that and inadequete as a daddy. Who knows, maybe I'd have forgotten Rennie if someone didn't remind me. Certainly, I don't consisder myself a d
