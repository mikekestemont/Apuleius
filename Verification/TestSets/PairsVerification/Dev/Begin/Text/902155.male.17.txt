Once again I have a ton of work to do for school... and I thought I had just finished everything last week. I am working on writing the oral part of my group presentation on Voltaire for Wednesday, but I have to finish it by tomorrow so we can rehearse. I have to do 10 more journals by Wednesday too, and I have to read a health chapter by tomorrow. Speaking of health, today we had our first end-of-the-month test. I completely bombed it. I did not know anything that was on it! I had no idea it would be so hard, so I just studied for only 10 minutes on the way to school.  Well, September is over (thank God!). The dodgers didn't make it to the playoffs, so I'm pretty disappointed. But the Angels did, and I'll probably go for them. I'm not really a baseball fan, but I'm starting to like it more.
OK... my first post. What to say... I have a bunch of homework to do, I wonder why I'm not starting it yet. I have so many questions to answer for chemistry, but it's not due for another week. Speaking of school, these first few weeks have been really hectic. I don't know how long it will take for me to adjust to my harder workload. It rained a little yesterday, I'm so excited for some reason to have this cool, cloudy weather back. I must be tired of all the summer sun. Anyway, I'm so happy that September is almost over. I've been trying to think of all the reasons that it's my least favorite month. It's my allergy season, the first month of school, the end of summer, and the height of hurricane season (actually I like the last one-hurricanes are pretty exciting to watch). Also, September is the worst month for the stock market, and is a month where the air is really smoggy with the fire season.
Finally the weekend is here! I have a 3 day weekend because of the freshman retreat. I can still remember my freshman retreat. As I look back on it, it wasn't as bad as I thought. I would like to do it over again, it had fun points, and I would have taken more advantage of it. I had to do a presentation on Voltaire last week (as I mentioned earlier) and as I was writing our oral report, I randomly decided to make it into a song. The song that was stuck in my head was "Sk8er Boi" so I just changed the lyrics to make it about Voltaire. Well we didn't use it in our presentation because no one wanted to sing, which is understandable. Yeah, I have no life.
Right now I feel like I had just lived through a tv show. OK, let me explain. You know in a tv show when after all the conflict and/or drama of the show is over, everything has a nice little happy ending. Well,  today was really stressful and right now that it's over, I f
