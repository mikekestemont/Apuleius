Well today was a very good day. I helped with VBS...4 year olds...yeah i won't say anything more. They are all sooo cute...but at that age they don't know how to sit still or be quiet with someone else is talking. Yep its me and tyler in there helping...aww he will be a good dad someday...awww hahaha. But they are alot of fun don't get me wrong...just im tired every single day after VBS...how will i survive when im like 25 with kids all day long...hmmm....oh well not the time to think about that. Today I also went with my friends Amory and Blake and Tyler to her uncle's church...it was really nice...we heard Megan from Casting Crowns speak she was really really good...I enjoyed that. And here i am now...tired but still writing this...thats why it might be alittle weird...but neways...i think thas all i have to say today. Goodnight.
Wow what could be better than going to the lake your last weekend of summer before school starts?  Well we left Wednesday night after church...i was sooo excited to go but we got there pretty late...and we all tried to go to sleep but me and Amory probably stayed up for an hour or two talking.  She was my roomate...good roomate too...haha.  Then the next day it rained which was kinda bad but we did get in the lake and Tyler and Blake kneeboarded.  Tyler kinda hurt his knee but its all gewd now.  So we had fun that day despite the weather.  The next day it was beautiful sun shinning...got alittle tan...hehe.  Later that night Me and Tyler, Blake and Amory went to get something to eat at this place on the lake...it was pretty good.  Well we came back...and we notice the Jet Ski was GONE...so we ran up to the house and walked in and our parents were acting all weird so we thought they took it out or something to teach us a lesson or something...so we ran back to the dock and got in the boat and went looking for the jet ski...we didn't see it anywhere...haha we looked like a search party...well we were but thats beside the point...so then Tyler's parents went looking for it too...we found a cop and told him and he reported it and all that jazz...then our boat ran outta gas...haha so they had to pull us home.  And that night was the BEST...we all sat on the boat joking around and acting sooo silly...i think it was the moon...which was the most beautiful moon i've ever seen and the best company ever made.  Then we went back up to the house and Blake went to sleep.  Me, Tyler and Amory played Uno...the game lasted for an hour and 35 mins...longest uno game EVER...I think Me and Amory were wayyyyyy to sleepy high...haha it was great...everything was funny that shouldn't have even been funny.  Then we all crashed and went to sleep...the next morning we found the jet ski woohooo...and came home.  Best weekend EVER.
