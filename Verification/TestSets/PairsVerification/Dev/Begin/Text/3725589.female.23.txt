Debbie awoke at the usual hour for her "non-working" periods, about 12:00am, the cats were howling for food and to be let out. She stumbled into the living room of her small flat, falling over a bag of rubbish she had failed to put out the night before on the way to turn on the computer. Her little clan of cyber friends would hopefully have written something to lift her spirits while she slept. She needed it, after reading&nbsp;yet another letter about some&nbsp;huge sum of money the bliffs were after her for&nbsp;, money she didn't have. She looked around at her scant material posessions, nothing for them to take instead of money. "Maybe they'll accept my blood" she thought and chuckled to herself as she envisioned the horrified look on the baliffs face&nbsp;as she&nbsp;slashed her right wrist in front of him and offered him some.&nbsp;&nbsp; the computer finally connected to the internet, and she sipped her first cup of tea. Not much had happened in her cyber community after she had retired it seemed, no new posts. She made a few token ones herself, sighed and went out in search of work just like she did everyday.
He's got a new girlfriend, his ex-apprentice, great, he dumped me for another woman before we even met! Can life be any crueler?  He did finally talk to me and we're still friends, and I will get to meet him, he's coming to England for a holiday. All for the best really, we'd probably have just fucked each others lives up anyway. At least he's talking to me again, and we're still friends. Well I'm going away tomorrow to WOMAD, it should be a good one, as I said previously, got my weed Wooo! I'm just going to go away and try not to think about it all for a few days.&nbsp;
I just deleted all johnnys PM's, it was harder than&nbsp;I thought it would be after the way he's acted. He sounds so loving in some of them, I wonder now if it was just some way to scam me. Good knows how, I've got nothing but a place for him to stay if he wanted it and my love if he deserved it. Suppose that's enough for some blokes. This is so gutting for me,&nbsp;I really thought there was something between me and this guy, but I'm obviously dispensible to him really. There's a chance he's just getting his head together, but I'm really starting to doubt that now. He's blown me out for sure, and I don't really understand why, if he was telling me the truth about not being angry. I hate it when any kind of relationship ends with no closure, even this one with a geezer I'd never even met. I must be a complicated person to have such a complicated life.&nbsp;
Well i'm going away again soon, that's a relief, get away from this damn Island for a while. Johnny's still not talking to me, his loss, hahaha. I hope we can talk again one day though, and he t
