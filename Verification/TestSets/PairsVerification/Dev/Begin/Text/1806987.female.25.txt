I walked into AT&T hoping to pay on my go phone account. The clerk, a young Black female, was already helping a customer, another young Black female. As I walked in the clerk was asking her for her work phone number to which the customer replied "Girl! I don't be knowing no phone numbers. I think its 855 something. Just put Nissan." The clerk chuckled and proceeded helping her establish her account.   There was another clerk, a pseudo-young white male, on the phone as I proceeded to survey my surrounding. He seemed to be on an important call, so I simply stood in line awaiting to helped. After five minutes the guy walked over to me, said I'll be right with you, and went into the back. The clerk already assisting the customer looks at me and says 'I'm sorry, I guess his personal call is more important'. By her tone you could tell this is something that has happened before. My mind raced and I thought 'here we go'.   The woman who was being waited on upon my arrival was accompanied by what I assume was her brother or her boyfriend and her son, who could not have been any older than three or four.   He ran around the place, unruly, but very innocently. He was playing cops and robbers or so it seemed, since he kept screening about who [his imaginary playmate] had the gun. The gentlemen and I, and secretively the clerk waiting on his mother, watched as he crawled back and forth across the building, screamed and tackled, kicked and enjoyed.

Something to the effect of  BE STILL .   After another five minutes of this and the witnessing of:  Clerk: What's your home phone number?  Customer: Girl!! I ain't got no home phone. Stop Jerod.  Clerk: He has a good imagination.  Customer: Girl!! He play like this at home. I mean it ain't nobody but me and him.   Jerod (who has collapsed on the floor after 15 seconds of silence): I want a baby.   Clerk: He wants a baby?  Customer: Girl!! He silly.  Clerk: Where is he going to get a baby from? He wants you to make a baby? (now becoming frantic at the mother's lack of concern) Jerod, where are you going to get a baby from?  Jerod: I'm going to make one.   The mother laughs, the clerk sighs and I am growing agitated.   Mr. Clerk finally returns and asks what he could do for me. I explained I was there to make a payment. He asked what type of phone did I have while simultaneously physically searching my person for it. I backed away and said 'I have a GO phone'.  He asked "Is the phone off."  I answered "No"  Without pausing to hear my answer he continues "Because if it is off it w
