Yup. That's right, I actually talked to him yesterday. However, I think I might have pissed him off, despite what he says. I don't know! I really want to apologise... but I'm afraid. Of him being angry with me. I just.. don't like being on anyone's bad side. But if I apologise, I'll have to clarify what I meant, but I'm not sure how to do that...  I hate this.  -----  Session Start (Fri Aug 20 00:05:25 2004 Me: Alright, so I have another, if slightly more stupid, question. Kyle: hit me! Me: er.. well, that wasn't wuite what I had in mind, but.... Me: :D Me: Anywho. I was wondering about, if you could only be remembered for one thing, what would it be? Kyle: wow Kyle: thats a big question Me: yeah, I realized that after I actually thought about it Kyle: i dont know Kyle: i'd hate for it to sound like a cliche... but i'd like to inspire someones life. even if its just to one person Me: ... what else were you going to say? Kyle: i dont know Kyle: its a really dep question Kyle: something id have to think about Me: well, you could always think and get back to me Kyle: yeah Me: a reason to keep in touch, which we haven't really been doing too much.

Which are pretty loose sometimes. Especially when I'm around the people who don't expect me to be as mature as I should be. Kyle: right...but the thing is... this question is like asking what do you hope to achieve in yout life Kyle: i think its something that slowly answers itself with time as you get older Me: I really hope so. Kyle: its pretty much like asking what the meanig of you life is Me: I suppose... and as I was trying to get my mind around saying, I think it's just to... mature, and learn more about yourself and life... and that's still not quite what I want to say. I just can't put it into words. Me: And that doesn't explain why we do this... why do we have morals? Me: heh. that sure got my mind moving, I suppose. Kyle: i know Me: ...you were going to add on again Kyle: was i? Kyle: lol Me: well, it looks like it. the thing keeps saying that you're still typing, but nothing else ever comes up. Me: so... what exactly are the lyrics for And Still? Me: ..I must seem like a stalker s
