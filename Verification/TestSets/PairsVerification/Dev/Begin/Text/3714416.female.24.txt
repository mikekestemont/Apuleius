Welcome to my blog (I hate that word, it's so ugly!). I'm the journaling type, so I'll be keeping this up pretty frequently, even if nobody reads it. :D  This will be the 'personal', often updated part of my webpage (www.scarlettvancouver.com), which is also a work of vanity that I still don't know why I'm doing...except that it seems fun, and I bought a web design package at an auction (Exotic Embrace for PACE- the designer of my page is www.freespiritmedia.com, she's excellent!).   I didn't realize until I was assigned duties to help get the webpage up and running how computer-illiterate I am! And here I thought I was the shit. As such, it will probably be a couple of weeks more until the site is fully operational and running smoothly (ie until I find some content, and learn enough about web publishing to maintain it myself), but feel free to check in and watch the progress, and/or email me with suggestions and comments. I'm totally into feedback, even if you're a stranger-- I think i'll start to feel a bit demented on here if I'm always typing and nobody's responding!  I'm leaving tomorrow to work for the week at the Red Lion in Victoria, BC. Looking forward to sunshine, the swimming pool in the hotel and that awesome awesome stage!
Welcome to my new online journal;     ' According to Scarlett'    Here I will be posting my writings, my daily musings (perhaps not everyday) and anything else I see fit to publish.  You are welcome to comment and come in and say hi.  My new website will be ready shortly so stay tuned for its unveiling!    Scarlett
I was sitting around happily watching Fear Factor and working on a new costume tonight (a white bunny romper with a bowtie, collar, and playboy appliques), when I got a call to go in and replace someone at the Penthouse...I'm a sucker, can't turn down work, so I packed up and rushed out. It was a fine night, dead dead dead, but I got to talk to lovely Vienna, who I haven't seen in forever, so it was worth it...it's x amount of money I&nbsp;wouldn't have made watching TV and sewing anyways; I'm happy&nbsp;:).   The problem is, the activity of it all has put me into an insomniac state- I'm really awful with sleeping anyways, but interruptions to my regular or expected schedule are the worst..I'll be lucky if I get 3 hours before I have to get up to leave for Whistler tomorrow :(. Ah well, I'll sleep on the bus :D.  Whistler will be nice...it &nbsp;sounds like the easiest schedule (8-12 ish every night), plus I'll get some good stuff in like a bit of hiking, some plant identifying (berry picking, hopefully!), and meeting hostel folk-- I have such a fondness for hostel folk, likely due to my status as&nbsp;one for so many years. Plus, hostel people are cool because they are usually people in transition, and people in transition have the best ideas about life and how to live it. AND I a
