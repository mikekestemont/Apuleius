Moral and Ethical Quandary: Appropriate response to recognizing an underage purchaser of alcohol.  While bagging groceries one day I saw a two young men approach a nearby register with a cart full of variously sized cases of beer.  One had a sort of ageless look: he could have been 18, he could have been 25.  He wore clothing very appropriate to the grunge scene, including an ugly flannel shirt, ripped off shorts, calf length black socks, and sneakers.  He also had a gross ponytail.  The other I recognized as having been in the same grade as the aforementioned pear-shaped lad  at my old school.  This boy could not have been older than a very recent nineteen.  As per regulations that we cashiers begrudgingly fill, their cashier took an ID, which checked out, and let them purchase a staggering amount of beer.  After they had left, I asked what the ID had said.  According to the cashier, 1970.  I thought that it was a bit of a stretch, and that nobody would claim to be 34 who was underage, but then maybe that was the angle that the grungy, ugly one had taken.  In any case, it was painfully obvious that they were arranging some sort of bacchanalia, in which the one who was under-age (of whose acquaintance I informed the cashier in question) was certainly going to partake.  I wish them well regardless.  I doubt that he even recognized me.  Soldier on, dude with the beer.  Fake ID Immunity Little secret: Store policy is that we sell if you have some kind of driver's license.  Way out of state? Cool.  No decals?  Aight.  Hard credit-card-like plastic? Not a problem.  If it has a state on it, and the DOB is 21 years ago, you can have whatever you want.  I was working the Express aisle with my manager bagging for me, and a kid came through looking to buy a six-pack.  I carded him, and he produced a Delaware license that put him at 22 years of age.  However, the young gentleman had not placed his real license or permit behind another card, rather he had just placed it, turned over, in one of the credit card slots, allowing me to see its color (pink, the color of New York licenses) and a barcode of the type that is unique to driver's licenses and learners permits.  Did I point it out to him?  Did I ask him trivia about Delaware?  Did I refuse him the beer.  Nope.  I let him purchase it, asking, as I made change, what he was doing in New York.  "Visiting Family" was his reply, and my manager grinned for the whole transaction.  I saw him in the store a few days later, perusing the newspaper rack as he undoubtedly worked up the courage to again buy beer, as I was walking outside to make a phone call on my break.  I thought about counciling him on the finer points of making a decent attempt to credibly buy beer, but I concluded that doing so would s
