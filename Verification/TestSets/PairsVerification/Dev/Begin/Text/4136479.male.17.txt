The Naked Singularity                            One of the most unusual characteristics of a Kerr black hole is the possibility that it could evolve into a naked singularity. Due to the law of conservation of angular momentum, a rotating black hole should rotate ever faster as its radius decreased. Once the object's angular momentum increased beyond it's mass, the event horizon of the hole would be moving in excess of the speed of light. At this point, the event horizon would simply vanish from the universe, exposing the singularity. The absence of the event horizon means that we could travel freely into and out of the singularity. While no one has yet to prove that naked singularities cannot exist, most physicists are strongly inclined to believe that such is the case. Safely within the event horizon, a singularity is effectively shut out of the universe. When it is naked, this region of utter disregard for the known laws of nature is free to interact with the rest of the universe. To illustrate just how disruptive such an object might be, the simple act of going into orbit around a naked singularity would enable one to travel to any point in the past (9).       Parallel Universes                             Of all a black hole's bizarre characteristics, none seems stranger than the fact that the solutions to Einstein's equations tell us that these holes in space-time can serve as bridges into other universes. As fans of science fiction are well aware, a parallel universe is a universe entirely separate from our own. Among the many speculations as to the nature of these universes, is the idea that there could be parallel versions of ourselves inhabiting these universes; each living out a slightly different version of our lives. This idea doesn't seem so irrational when viewed in relation to the equally strange world of quantum mechanics (10). It is important to note, however, that the existence of these other universes is, at present, a purely theoretical construction.
Black holes are my biggest fascination , so here goes !!!:        The Schwartzschild Black Hole    Dr. Schwartzschild found that if a mass is compressed into a sufficiently small radius, space-time becomes so severely distorted that even light can't escape from the gravity well. While it may seem improbable that such compression could ever truly occur in nature, it has been found that stars containing, minimally, between two and three times the mass of our sun should collapse in just such a manner. The theory being that once these stars exhaust their supply of fuel, they begin to collapse inward with such tremendous force that even the powerful internuclear forces within the atoms of the star aren't sufficient to prevent it from continuing to fall in on itself until the entire mass of the star is concentrated at a point called a singularity. Within the singularity, matter is infinitely compressed into a region of infinite density.  At the singularity, gravity is infinite . Space-time has become infinitely curved (3). At the present time, science has no tools to describe conditions within the singularity.     All l
