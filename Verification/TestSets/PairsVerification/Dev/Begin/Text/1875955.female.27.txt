1. I bought a caramel slice from the bakers. A caramel slice is about the size of the palm of your hand. It is a layer of soft shortbread, a layer of thick caramel and a layer of chocolate. We used to have them when we were little - but they always had to be cut into three and shared between us. Now I am grown up, if I want a whole caramel slice, I can have one.  2.

The fliers for our latest book at work came in. I thought up the idea for them, which was a labyrinth, and the suggestion that our book can help you find your way through.
