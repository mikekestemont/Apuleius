\/\/ell, I'm out of my first year in high school.  I didn't take any hard classes as a freshman though. here's my grades from the classes I had Health-       A Photography-  B- Physical Ed.- A+ Science-      B English 9-    A- Algebra 1-    A See, they weren't that hard, and I frankly did little homework.  I still worked hard though, before I didn't do ANYTHING and I was a D student, but now I feel like I did much better.  Next years is going to be harder too, and I'll have less time because I'm joining more curricular activities. I allready know my schedule (well not the order my classes are going to be in, but I know what classes I'm taken)  Us History Biology Geometry physical Ed 11 French 1 English 10  Then I formed a sport for extra curricular activity so I have a sport for every season. At the beginning of school I'll take Cross Country when Cross Country is over then winter will be here and I'll be taking Nordic Ski-Cross Country then when that is over I'll be taking Track (like I took this year)  Well other than that my freshman year is over and in a couple of months I'll be starting school as a sophmore (yikes!!!).  My first week for the summer I jogged like 10 miles a day and visited my grandma at my dads house and did a few piano recital's. Which reminds me I should go practice piano. (I'll do that right when I'm done typing in this blog) Then my second week for this summer I wanted to help daddy, so I removed all these sticks from the backyard which took ALL DAY!  I dragged tons of heavy logs that were twice my size and you bet I developed some arm muscle from that!  Well I also developed something else from the logs.  POISON OAK (T_______T) it's pretty bad too.  It's all over my body, yes even on my chest! The worst part is it's on my chest and my right side of my face. On my right side of my face it's swollen up and red and bubbly, and oh it's horrible.  I'm too scared too go outside and do my four mile jog (since I'm at my dads house I have not much places to jog too) but since I get beeps from jogging without poison oak on my face, I don't even want to know peoples reactions when they see a girl jogging which looks like a big red bubbly faced mutant.  They probably do something worse than honking I'll tell you that. (T____T) so I'm not going out in public or jogging. I might as well just do my power work outs like-1000 crunchies, and 100 leg lifts.  That'll work (T____T) but it's not the same.     Most the time I'm either playing DDR Max 2 or DDR Max 1, working on heavy mode, to pass the time. That even annoys my grandma and aunt, so I'm usually hesitant to play it, but HEY! I can't stay o
