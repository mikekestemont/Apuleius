"Although you currently have a possition in an organization, in order to justify that possition you must demonstrate your value to the company on a daily basis. As a professional or knowledge worker, freeing yourself from an unhealthy dependence on the corporation and feeling, thinking, and acting like a Free Agent increase your value to your organization and in the marketplace." -- Free Agent (Published in 1997 by Jossey-Bass)
I bumped into my old client this morning. We used to do some consulting work for his agency, a statutory board. He seems well and quite happy. But he also told me that the whole government body is freezing and cutting down on head count, 3% reduction per year, or something like that. I wonder what would happen to all those civil service people? They can't be possibly go to private sector and try to make a living, can they? Well, they can try, but based on my past consulting experience with them, I doubt they can cut it. Probably only the top 10%-15% of the staff could make it in the private sector. As for the rest of 85%, well... come on boys come to private sector and we'll teach you a good lesson! In private sector we do real work, and not just paper work!

So come onboard, and learn to swim while in the deep pool! No life guard here. Welcome to real life!

It's the feeling of starting a new job in a new place. It just reminded me how I haven't got the feeling for a very long time. Perhaps I have stayed in my current job for a little bit too long. Perhaps I've become more lazy and less daring as the years go by. Perhaps I have more commitment and family responsibilities now compared to my younger days. Perhaps the economic is still not recovered yet, and no good jobs available out there. Perhaps... perhaps.
Motivation is a key for people to be productive. I notice in my colleagues, who are demotivated, that they don't actually putting much effort to get the work done. In fact, they tend to operate in a fire-fighting mode -- attending to the problem that create biggest fire. Not a very effective way of prioritising. But lately I too found myself to operate in this manner. I guess that would come a point where all of us the average employees would just give up on the management and just "switch off" and just do whatever we're told to do, without any additional initiative to make it better. What's the p
