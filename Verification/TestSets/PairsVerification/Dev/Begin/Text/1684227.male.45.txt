Well ... I guess somebody's reading my blog! Betcha didn't know I had that much pull with the Bush Administration, eh what?  Hmmmm ... what shall I demand next? I know; let's give former Yugoslavia Most Favored Nation status.  I'll see what I can do.
Sadly, an icon of our youth is passing. Fare Thee Well,  urlLink Beetle.
Retirement For A Legend!  So,  urlLink Anna Kournikova may retire?  You mean she had a sports career?   26-Year Reunion? Huh?  Had a 26-year class reunion this past weekend. Yeah, I know ... 26th??  Well ... we  tried  to have a 25-year reunion last fall, but the deadbeats in my class didn't sign up, so it had to be canceled. Out of 307 graduating students, with about 295 still alive, only 16 signed up. Pathetic. Guess they heard  I  might be there.  So last fall, about seven of us met at  urlLink Cobblestones  for a mini-reunion, mostly because  urlLink Miles  flew in from California. You see, he had already booked his flight when they canceled the reunion. Poor guy ... but he's a Liberal, so who cares *grin*. You know Liberals ... they love being  victims  of something -- anything. *big smile*  So Jed Strausbaugh, just a regular guy, put together a 26-year "off year" picnic reunion. Well, about 30 classmates signed up, and about 45 people total (spouses and girlfriends, that's the difference) showed up. It was fantastic. The small size meant you could really talk to people instead of just idle chit-chat. The picnic format was nice. Also, we didn't have music, which meant you could actually talk instead of yelling "HUH?" all night.  I'd recommend this format.   Cigars  I started smoking cigars on August 19, 2002 -- almost a year ago. In that short time I've become quite the  urlLink aficionado.  Premium cigars, mind you. The textures, the flavors, the shapes and sizes ... it's the flaming equivalent of fine wine (another hobby). Cigars are the ultimate reward, the status symbol that screams  I Am Successful!  ... and they're just plain good. I buy them  urlLink online  in boxes or bundles, and one at a time at Self Serve Beverage in York.  Send any and all premium cigars to me; I'll appreciate it. Did I mention that I was a mooch?    urlLink Fewer Air Marshalls   Great ... just great. This is Homeland Security?
urlLink The Dandy Warhols  have a great new song, "You Were The Last High". Web site art ain't too bad, either *grin*.  FYI. I'm just talkin', that's all.
Okay, I'll stray into the political arena a bit here, but this opinion is something I've been carrying around for many, many years.  Consumerism is killing this country. It's nearly a foundational problem; that is, it's almost the root of all our ills (hey! Didn't someone once say "... for the love of money is the root of all evil"?). Let me give some examples and some insight.  You buy a house. You get a mortage. Let's say the mortage is $140,000 (my house -- four bedrooms, two baths, two-car garage, fireplace, pool). Y
