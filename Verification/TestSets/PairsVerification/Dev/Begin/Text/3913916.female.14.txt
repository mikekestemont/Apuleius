Isko. Kat. Mic-mac. Steph. Vicky. Lari. Lianne. Klarisse.  It's really nice to get along with someone; to spend time with someone not that close with you; and with someone you can be bestfriends with. I love to have a time with my not-too-close-friends and get to know them better.  I just hope that I may be able to bond with my other classmates because its been 3 yrs since I've entered Honor Sec but until now, I don't know them that well.  ** Ang saya ng araw ko!! Ang saya talaga sa house ni Klar. Nag-reminisce kami nila Steph, Vicky, Lari, Lianne at Klar. Ang saya saya. Nakita pa namin nila Klar, Vicky at Lari si Sir Romero nung may buhok pa sya. Pinakita namin, using webcam, kanila Pielle. Pati kanila Sophie. Tapos pati pic ni Soj nung Sr Prep. Ang asteeg talaga!! Sa totoo lang, hindi kami natapos sa mga proj.**
Go to:  urlLink Googlism    and search for you name...

You take advantage of the kindness this person showed you.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hindi mo naipapakita yung  thankfulness  sa mga ginawa nya  for you.   Sana isipin din natin na kahit sa tingin ng iba, na nakakainis ang taong yun,  he still touched our lives and we thank him for this.  Its so hard to think that someone moving away and leaving us because of some conflicts or issues we have.    Sana talaga magbago ang isip ni sir guinto...
"I miss you when there's no reason, how much more if there was. I miss you more when you reply, how much more if you don't. I miss you after I see you, how much more if I see you never. I miss you now how much more later..."   Katrina Santos. Rachel Casis. JM Ochangco. Rosemae Rubio. Patrick Deyto. Leonette Gonzaga. Jessica Carlos. Rina Villar. Larson Smit. Joseph Castro. and everybody else! I miss them all. Some were really my closest friends, even best friends, some were just friends. All the moments we had, all our laughter we shared together, the getting-to-know-you days, and every memory. I miss them all; I miss that all. I want to talk to them again; befriend them again; bond with them; and laugh and talk to them. If I could just turn back time, I'll really do something about this - like always talk to them, just by s
