So many things I could talk about today. Didn't get to talk to my Daddy, left him a message though. Spent the day with minime asking where her Dad was and why he was taking so long to see her. But made her smile and feel special no matter what. Talked to a few people today, old friends, new friends, special people.  I am sooooooo proud of my friend Sean for his marathon run today!! YAY!!!! I better get my butt in gear and get back in shape or I will never keep up hahaha.  So I was thinking (yeah yeah today I actually DID think) the whole concept of good karma and reaping what you sow. If energy can never be destroyed..maybe the actual energy generated while you are doing something for others is released somehow into the ether and one day will cause a positive reaction in someone else that eventually gets back to you. Likewise the bad energy too...meh...never know huh? Was an interesting thought though. I think I will eat something really bad for me now so I can have freaky dreams and write another interesting blog in the morning... MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAA!!!  Cheers!
when I was hanging out with Dino. We were talking about the higher quality of Greek leather...well he was I was pretending I thought he was right. He was going on about how they make good belts. ( I think he had been awake for something like 49 hours at this point meeting a work deadline ) I was thinking "Yannow...I have heard about a lot of things from Greece don't think belts were in that list" Sometimes I think...nahhhhhh I NEVER think...muahahahahahaaa. Holy molaaaaay I need more coffee or a brain or a Greek Belt?  Cheers

Ugh finally the only show worth watching on TV has come along. The WB's Superstar USA, ooooh man I LOVE that show. An underhanded and mean reality show that takes AWFUL singers who think they are good and lets them howl on international TV. The cast members they chose were perfect Tone-Loc, Vitamin C and a guy named Briggs. Their acting ability to sit there and pretend to be loving people singing like cats in a blender in indeed impressive. So they take them to Hollywood give them makeovers and let them sing..badly. The final 4 were well chosen Jo-Jo who told people it was his "gah-dunk-a-dunk" that made him star material. (that means his butt for those not in the know **wink**) Mario who must weigh all of 90 pounds soaking wet and looks like the kids who used to get shoved in lockers in high school. Jaime the obligatory blonde bimbo with more cup size than cranium size. Rosa the latina firecracker who lives in her own lil world and was probably the worst singer there. I do have to admire all the entertainers confidence in themselves albeit a lil misguided. I missed the last show because someone special was getting her swimming badge and h
