. . . Ashleigh just IM'd me hoping that my "Kyle/Best Friend" entry was about Kyle Earnst, and not her brother!  It's ok, it wasn't about her brother so no worries!  And then she was like, are we ok?  And I was like I hope so!  And then yay, it's happy!  We said "Sorry" and now everything should be happy!  Woo Hoo!
Bob tells me I don't know what love is!   My reply:  Well, maybe I don't know what love is, but I do know what its like to like someone so much you hate them because you know that nothing is going to happen!  Its the worst feeling!  And thats how I feel every time I see him!  So maybe it would just be better if I didn't see him anymore, then I wouldn't have to feel like that anymore! I like Bob a lot, and maybe I don't show it all the time because he pisses me off!  I want lots of attention from him, and when I don't get it I get jealous!  But that doesn't matter anymore because I'm going to get over him!  If I did know what love was, and if I did know what it was like to have a "real" best friend then I would have to say that Kyle is one of my best friends and I love him!   Because even if people hate me and call me names, he stays my friend!  People ask him to not talk to me, and he still does!  He is a true friend and I love him because when I'm around him I feel happy and it's like yay, I'm with Kyle!  Rachel called me and I didn't want to talk so I didn't answer!  I texted her and asked her what she wants!  She told me that her and Shandi miss me and they want to be my friend again!  I told her that I miss them too, but the harassing hurt and that it made me sad that they didn't trust me, because I never doubted anything they ever said to me!  AND, I thought Shandi never liked me!  Then they told me that Shandi really never hated me and that they were sorry, but they've gone through the harassment too, and that they want to be my friend again!  So I told them that I want to be there friend again too, because I love them and they always made me so happy!  We had so many fun times together!  And maybe, they can all come back and maybe be even better, because I'm trying really hard to be a better person!
