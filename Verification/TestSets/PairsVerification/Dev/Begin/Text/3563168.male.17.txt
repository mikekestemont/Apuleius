Looky there, I turned the "She Spies" logo into a "She Spies Sucks" logo. This is really old, but I thought I would show people that haven't seen it.
I can't believe that Pepsi has this whole crock of shit about appealing to Hispanic people. Not only that, but the problem is that they go out of their way to put the word "si" in their product with the thought that this is going to make Hispanics think Pepsi is amazing.  If you put "yes" next to the word Fanta on a can, it wouldn't make me want to drink only Fanta for the rest of my life.  Then you have the fact that the product hasn't changed at all, it's just the word "si" on the label. It's obvious that Pepsi is so dumb that they think Hispanics are easily won over by having Spanish next to the word Pepsi.  In the political campaigns, even though there are commercials for the canidates in Spanish, the Spanish speakers say that they will want to understand the issues and that a language will not just win over their vote.  So maybe Pepsi can realize this, stop being stupid, and drop all the crap.
Man, I hate getting sick. I mean, it's hard enough for me to sleep during the night, having a headache and stuffed up nose doesn't help any. I'm gonna make love to the person that comes up with a cure for the common cold (considering it's a woman (considering she's hot)).  Does anyone know how I got sick during the summer anyway? That's never happend to me before, I dunno why.  Due to the fact that I stay up so late, I've started watching "Hawaii 5-0". It's pretty badass, almost as badass as "Matlock".  I figure if I get a vacuum and put it in my nostrils, they will finally clear up. That would be badass.
Holy crap, it's gonna rain for forever. I wish it would stop.  I fell asleep really early last night, so I didn't update since I worked at Sonic for a while.  Next update is going to be better than this one.  Jay Leno rules.
Man, I love turkey sandwiches. They might just be the greatest thing ever invented AND consumed. Sorry to you vegetarians and turkeys out there, but you're either too edible and/or unable to eat the awesomeness that is a turkey sandwich.  Every time I go to a place that serves turkey sandwiches (especially Chilli's) I order it. I mean, I prolly could survive in the middle of nowhere with no human contact if I had an infinite amount of turkey sandwiches. As sad as this may sound, eating a turkey sandwich makes my day.  You should know, however, that that isn't sad because turkey sandwiches kick ass.  I saw "Dodgeball" today, and Chuck Norris was in it. So I recommend that you watch it, because Chuck Norris is the badest ass person ever, and he makes the movie totally worth it.  Also, the movie's pretty funny.
I dunno if it's all the day time T
