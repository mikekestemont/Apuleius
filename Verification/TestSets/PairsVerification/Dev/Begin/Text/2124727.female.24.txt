urlLink    Isn't it a very bad attitude for a lawyer (Elly Pamatong) to scatter metal spikes on the main roads just to be noticed? Don't you think that's plain stupid? I am glad he was disqualified as a presidential candidate. He doesn't have the right attitude!  Posted by Belle
Congratulations to the team of Ms. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and Kabayan Noli de Castro for winning the Presidential and Vice Presidential race! It's a very good team and deserving, too.  Despite the rigmarole during the vote counting and canvassing, they were finally proclaimed winners. It's a race well won I suppose, after all the things that happened, the postponements and bad publicity. Well, let's just hope they will do well and perform their duties accordingly for the improvement of the country and not of their bank accounts. I'm keeping my fingers crossed as I believe other Filipinos do.  I hope the people who do not Ms. Arroyo will accept the situation that she won and help make the Philippines a better place to live in. They should stop protesting instead because that's just a waste of money, energy, and time. Instead, work well and enjoy life. Do not worry because the government officials are under constant watch of the press and other groups. The noise barrages should be fine but please don't keep it going until your own earns burst out.  Give them a chance to do their jobs and let's just do ours. After a year or two, we can start complaining if we see no progress or they haven't done anything to alleviate the condition of our country.  May God bless the Philippines and all the newly elected officials of the country! Let us pray... Hail Mary, Full of Grace! The Lord is with you...
Aw! The roads are just too full of dirts and rubbish. People don't really know how to throw their dirts in the proper places. It's disgusting!  The biggest problem I noticed is the lack of trash bins. I am often frustrated to go to a corner expecting a trash bin but finding none. Instead, I smell urine reeking from the corners. The Metro Manila Development Authority or the government officials or barangay (village) officials should always note the importance of trash bins. They should put bins in conspicuous places where people are expected to throw dirts and refuse, i.e., the base step of an overpass, at the top of an overpass, in waiting sheds, in tricycle and taxi stands, in parks, and along the highway where people are often standing by waiting for public vehicles. If they do that, people just might learn to discipline themselves because trash bins are easily available for use and there's no more reason to throw things away everywhere.  It is my experience that sometimes, when I am carrying garbage and other stuff, I feel like throwing the rubbish away but can't find bins so I just carry it along with me. But if I don't have the discipline, it would have been so easy to just throw or drop it on t
