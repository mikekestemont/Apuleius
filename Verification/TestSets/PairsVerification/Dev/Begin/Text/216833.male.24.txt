The bump came in today - a day before I expected it. That is good news. I have to pay less apartment late fees and I feel a little better about the whole mess. Still waiting on those letters from the bank to resolve this creditcard fraud mess.  Just listening to the radio in the cold room - ahh - technology - everything I love about it seems to cancel itself out with everything I hate about it.   am ordering the new 7" covers this week, if all goes well. I am looking forward to the end of the line with that shit. Looking back on the last year, all the changes that have happened seem to always have that in the picture - shows have fallen to ruins.  The band thing has run its course with me, never again. That is a stage in my life that I am over with for good. I love art, making things, music too, but I just can't deal with the bull shit anymore. Almost all my friends are from connections in music. I wouldn't trade that for anything in the world. I still enjoy making shirts. I don't really enjoy building websites anymore, not like I used too. I wonder if there is more to come. Have I just not matured enough, have I not found myself like I think I have?   Since Eric is selling a few things, I also have a few things that I will through up for you guys before I take em to my parents for a garage sale:  Glass Dinning table and chairs(the chairs have seen the rath of a kitty) $100 o.b.o.   Time Killers arcade game - $160  Corner Computer Desk: $40  I am moving and I will have alot of other shit for sale. But problably nothing really cool.
hahahaha....the morning has been great so far. Halloween. I came to work looking like a zombie with an afro. I got the fake "bloody scabs" all over my arms. I usually don't do this but latly I have been enjoying this holiday. It's fun...its just a little fake blood, it never hurt anyone. People are jumpy around here, I've just been doing my normal stuff and i get a few jumps here and there.  I guess it looks pretty good becuase i feel like a fucking animal in a cage... people just looking and going, "Hey Mark, check this guy out!" Fuck OFF! Its just a little fake blood, never hurt anyone...
just added my interview with myself
well.......i guess lunch time is over. I really wish i would get a record or two from someone in the mail... I got an order to No Idea for like 8 7inches and an order for a few SOV 7inches and a Karate 7" i won off of ebay....nothing yet.  I feel sleepy. only 3 more hours of the work and I will be right back here again being retarded and wasting time in front of a PC.
