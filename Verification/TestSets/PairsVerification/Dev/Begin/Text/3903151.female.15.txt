Mood - Nuetral    Music&nbsp;- 'Definately Maybe' by FM Static   &nbsp;&nbsp;  Well I made it to Texas and I survived the endless Spanish, Fountain Of Relatives, and the horrible Tejuano music. I have to admit that I did have some fun along the way. With 31 cousins in the same house at one time and a barbeque going (accompanied by alcohol) you can't get too bored. These daym mexican's are half the population of the world(!), I'm tellin' ya! We multiply like rabbits! I got to know my family a lot better and found that half of them have been in jail. Now if thats not cool I dont know what is (In a scary kinda way). And they all ended up in jail for stab'n, shoot'n, or killing&nbsp;someone&nbsp;(Cough Uncle Benny Cough). Imagine my surprise when he is telling me all these stories and I am sitting 2 inches from him. No matter half the torture I did benefit from this trip. I walked away with a new found appreciation for the english language, a cell phone bill higher then the Empire State Building (not exactly a benefit.), I learned that I hate small confined spaces (Because I flew there on a pencil with wings!!!), and 2000 dollars worth of clothes and other apparel all curtisey of my fathers credit card.   Ya know what, I actually missed this gawd forsaken little town and all of its contents. More so the familiarity of the area and the people that are associated with it. Yes... shock... I got home-sick. Half the time my father left me with my relatives while he went out with his friend Jeff till 2:00 in the AM. But I walked away with half of his life saveings so I guess I shouldn't complain, lol.   Ya know what... screw the small talk. I'm leave'n I'm grumpy and horny and I jes' UGH! TTYL! Lol
Mood - Bitter sweet. Music - 'Gifts And Curses' by Yellowcard.        No matter how many times you tell people or post it on the WORLD WIDE WEB that you don't wake up until 3-4:00 in the AM you still get those lingering calls at 9:00 in the dern' morning! Thats exactly how I woke up today and what made it worse was that it was the wrong number. How pleasant =|! So I started my day at 9:00 in the AM. That lasted till about 9:02 at which I fell face first back into my pillow and continued my day like that until 3:00 in the PM. So when I finally woke up I talked to a few people on the phone, watched a little TV, got something to eat, and headed to the ole' computer. Seems to be a daily occurance of events, huh?     I found out that I'm not the only person getting pranked, yay! Billi Sue, Danielle, Lindsay, Sylvia, and Chris are all victims. At this rate those bastards with have an unruly mob after them. And yes... I did get prank called again today. It was some computer soundboard about doing push-ups w
