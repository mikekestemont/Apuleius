I just wanted to let the world know that a "smashingly wonderful girl" (AKA my girlfriend) has recently posted her blog for everyone to see at the following URL.  Please check it out and leave her lots of nice comments!  URL:  urlLink http://www.laurenwalters.com/blog/blogger.html
Well, today has been a long hard day--as can be expected during this time of the year with the local governments scrambling to spend their left over budget funds before they disappear at the end of the fiscal year.    Why the government operates this way is beyond me.  You could rest assure that if a business were to operate in this manner, they would have been out of business before they even opened up.  Where is the incentive?  Put yourself in the shoes of a regional government agency's administrator and think about it.  What person in their right mind would  not  spend the left over money?  Why let it go back into the State's general fund when all you have to do is spend the money to keep it local?  I don't know about all of you fine folks out there in the internet ether, but I would much rather the money that I worked hard for--to give to the government--be left alone in my bank account then spent because a government admin "had to."
When I was taking one of my advanced web design classes at  urlLink IS, Inc.  in Sacramento, the person teaching the class--a Mr. Rob Huddleston--directed us to one of his pet internet projects.  His page is still a work in progress, but it has some pretty good content for people looking to pickup some odds n' ends for basic web design and  urlLink Macromedia  products.  For example, on the site you can find some links to older versions of various web browsers, which is very helpful for those of you who are designing your websites to look good in browsers such as Netscape 4.0, etc.  My favorite use for this website is the convenience of checking on when the next  urlLink Sierra Macromedia User's Group  Meeting is.  I can never remember the web address for some reason and it is easier for me to remember  urlLink http://www.universityofhtml.com  then it is to remember  urlLink http://www.sierrammug.org/ ...don't ask me why.  Anyway, check out the website and, if you get a chance, check out the classes that Rob teaches at IS, Inc.  He did a pretty good job at teaching the class and it was definitely worth the time and money.  URL:  urlLink http://www.universityofhtml.com
How is it that  urlLink Dilbert  can capture the essence of what it is to be in IT so well? Sheer genius--that's all it can be.
What a wierd format...  Sometimes I wonder who at Microsoft thinks up this stuff.  Today has been such a long day, and I can't wait to hit the sack.  This weekend is graduation weekend here in Chico (Go  urlLink Chico State !) and the bars are going crazy!  Graduating Seniors--and their parents--going crazy at the local bars.  Sometimes when I see this it makes me think back to my l
