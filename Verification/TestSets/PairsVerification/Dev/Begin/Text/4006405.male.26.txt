Nothing of interest has happened yet. Just thought you'd like to know.
Ever get paint on the clothes of your department's director? Yeah, that's how my night went. Maybe I should start carrying a bucket of cold water with me? Just in case I see the need to drown myself on a moment's notice.
Have you ever noticed how what one generation grew up with becomes kitsch for the next generation? Today, I went shopping for a Messenger Bag (ended up having an eye exam instead, but that's a different story). In my search, I walked by two displays. One was an Old Navy display that had old Route 66 type slogans and adverts on them. The type of things my parents would have seen on television as they were watching 1950's TV. The second was a Hot Topic display. On sale there were t-shirts advertising Transformers, not the new crappy show mind you, but the old, "Me Grimlock, you lunch" Transformers. Somehow, I wonder why kids, and let's face it, if anyone over the age of 14 walked into a Hot Topic for any other reason than to apply for a job, I'd be amazed; would want to wear a t-shirt from a show they've never seen. Maybe I'm just getting old.
Yesterday, I really had the urge to get out of my ridiculously small apartment and go somewhere. So, I decided to head downtown and visit Chinatown. After all, I hadn't been to Chinatown in while and figured I could pick up some good Pot Stickers. Okay kiddies, the next time I get the urge to go somewhere, for God's sake, please shoot me.

"Mommy, Daddy, I want one of these."     "Uh, honey, that's not a toy."     "But look, it says Hello Kitty on it, and it vibrates!"     *stoned silence*     (NB: I actually overheard this conversation)       Next time I go to Chinatown, I'm going at night, for food, or the Chinese New Year parade.
They're small, colored, although the old ones are mostly white, and hold vast amounts of music, information, and even some games. In my life, I've seen some great things: The personal computer, the Internet, the Mariners with a winning season, the rise and fall of the PDA, cellular phones, readily available Anime in the US, another winning season for the Mariners, the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, free webcomics, Spider-Man 1 and 2, etc, etc....       But the I-Pod is the first that I've never wanted to leave home without. Easy to use, easy to update, convenient, and well, cool. I feel 10+ cooler just wearing one and I'm one of those people who projects an invisible shield that automatically repels people. I'm not e
