[ Goofy Thoughts on a Unified Field Theory ]  I am addicted to our quest for a unified field theory that explains everything--if you don't know what I'm talking about, search Unified Field Theory on Google. It would take me too long to explain. Anyway, I keep thinking that if, and when, we truly discover am expression for this, it would have to explain EVERYTHING--in cluding social behavior, psychology, art, literature, etc., etc.  In keeping with my previous post--and the notion that the final theory will be so simple that it can be printed on a t-shirt--I thought I would contribute my goofy thought. Wouldn't it be comical if the final expression were as simple as:  E + R = 0  where E equals some positive integer (some positive energy) and R equals the negative of E. Zero then must be both an expression of value as well as a symbolic expression of infinite measure--everything and nothing at the same time. The notion being that everything in the universe--infinitely big and infinite small--has a positive value that tends toward individuality (repulsion) but exists in a constant state battle (equalibrium) against an equally strong force that is acting to keep it part of a larger whole (attraction). The result it both a zero-sum and a non-zero sum state at the same time (everything and notion simultaneously). Absolute and undefined in a single state--a single expression... "0" The beauty is that it says everything, is reducable from all expressions we currently use, and yet defines nothing. It answers everything yet defines nothing (which is a very important part of human existance). It would reilquish the need for God yet still demand God as a missing value in the equation--much like our understanding of life right now.   I know this is rediculous, but I thought someone might enjoy it.
[ Addendum to Desire No. 1 ]  Many have said that human beings are social animals. I disagree. I see society as a drug. A diversion which begs us to come to the dance. To ignore who, and what, we really are--which is alone. Human beings are uniquely aware and at the same time afraid to be aware. We are so attracted to each other because we struggle with our inability to apply our awareness for the purpose of explaination. Like all popular drugs, unfortunately, society--the scoial high, if you will--ultimately fails us in the most important of goals. We come together with hopes and dreams of being recognized for who we are--as individuals. But the drug takes over. We join the crowd. We play our roles. And, then we leave each other with no real connection. No exposure. Exposure, in fact, is the antithesis of what society is about because society demands--at its extremes--either the protection of decorum or neglect and fantasy of absolute freedom. Exposure would ruin everything. When the drug takes h
