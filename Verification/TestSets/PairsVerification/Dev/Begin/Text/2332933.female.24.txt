I finally got up the energy to pull out the cart and load my oversized laundry bag tightly packed with stale laundry inside to head to the Laundromat.  On a laid back weekend afternoon, I faced the decision of the day, which Laundromat to go to?  There's the one I love, that is about half-a-mile away, which always requires extra amounts of energy to go all the way down eight blocks and over two.  Then there is the place around the corner.  The closest Laundromat always seems to bring on the inner debate between proximity and quality of laundry.  It is only about 700 feet away from my apartment, but there are never any driers available and the staff doesn't seem to care all that much.   Unfortunately, on an afternoon where I have over a months worth of laundry, proximity wins and I pick the closest one.  One thing I do like about the place around the corner is that they have the top loading, washers like the one I had at home as a kid.  I always know how to use these, so I am usually more comfortable throwing my laundry in without the fear that the detergent won't release out of the hatch, or that I my laundry will stick to the upper wall of the chamber and I'll lose a sock.  I loaded three washers full of clothing, started them up and pulled out the needles and yarn that I had been using to knit a scarf.

The exclamations coming from all the customers finally push the ladies who work there into action as they recognize the problem and run to grab the fire extinguisher.    We all walk outside to get out of the smoke, and the lady next to me says,   "That's what I get for being lazy."  I realize that others get sucked into what I like to call the law of the Closest Laundromat.  I am sure had either her or I taken the time and energy to walk to the next nearest Laundromat, this whole chain of events could have been avoided. But when it comes down to it, I would be willing to spare a couple of pairs of undies to the drier gods in order to save a walk downtown.  The manager comes in with the fire extinguisher and puts out the flames.  Then, as if nothing is wrong with the place, he comes out the front door and proclaims,  "No fire, nothing to worry about."  At this point I am standing on the sidewalk with my knitting in hand, when two fire trucks pull up to inspect.  Out come about s
