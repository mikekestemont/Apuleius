returned back at 8pm... today's the longest hours i worked so far... so tiring... haha... i guess by 10pm i will be asleep... online oso nothing to do... life's really that bored...? plus that job... i thought that new cd is flawless but it ended up as a disappointment too... but the hell is the use of the patch then? they can't still solve the problem! i just hate to install for the users some bugged programs, although derek insisted me to install and dun care that much... i want to get out of this job... few more days like today and i'll be worn out...
ok so in the end i nv did get to join them all... so i stayed at home and had a steamboat dinner... stretches from 9pm to 11pm... so full now... so much for the "mindcept" to slim down... anyway, that wasn't realistic... for me... haha... hmmm... tml i will be working alone at MND at tanjong pagar... god watch over me... it'll be another lifeless week again... how i long to get out of this prison... actually there's another problem bothering me... but i guess it'll be unavoidable... it just depends how long more it will last... especially when poly is starting and everyone's scattered around... well we'll see to it... ok... gtg blog... cya...
went to MND for work today... returned home quite early today... and i intentionally dun call derek so that he won't tell me to go other places =p... before i leave the building... my escort simon asked me if i need a part time job... i can apply for it at the helpdesk there... he say the rest of the part timers cannot make it... and he said i tried very hard to make the installation as fast as possible... so happy... hahaha... anyway... derek's right la... angry so much for what... pple there still so happy and i making my life so miserable... i try to do it lor.. but sometimes it's within my limits to look at the bright side of things... it's so irritating at times and unless i am a zombie i can't react peacefully... so... see how life goes lor... later 8pm they all going out to lim kopi... hope nothing impt later so i can manage to go there and GOSSIP... hahaha...
went to queensway with gl ws hm gene and chuan... bought 2       t-shirts for $20... realised i am facing financial crisis... and later jack's place for father's day celebration... i really can't be a spendthrift now... if not i have to beg my mum again for daily expenses... well anyway... i felt so bad the whole day... i think i need counselling... but who cares? along the way home on the bus 855... gl and ws were just tempting us to ask them what was so amazing about something that we do not know... and eventually never say out...eugene was so gian to ask everytime.. that reminds me of a scene which happened 4 yrs ago... jingyi and the gang... being so secretive a
