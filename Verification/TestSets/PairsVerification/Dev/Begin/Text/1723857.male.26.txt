Fiji continued...   The island taught me to hate Justin Timberlake (not that it took much to accomplish that) and many other artists I had never heard of, but hated instantly, nonetheless.  Apparently, good dance CD’s must be imported from the mainland and are hard to come by.  And all the songs on a CD must be bootleg recordings off of FM radio (they sounded horrible!).  Nikki & Gazz liked my mini-credo, “Be dependable, but not predictable.”  Maybe I should © it when I get home…  I drank nothing but water for 3 days (except for some milk in my cereal).  It wasn’t that bad…  I can’t wait to unpack!!!  Sheets that don’t smell!!  I really hope the Randwick Lodge in Sydney is nice.  Here's a list of the people we've met so far...  The Islanders 	Laura #1—met her in line at LAX; From Cincinnati, going to U. Tenn. 	 Laura #2— from London (Essex?); recently graduated university w/ a business degree; Friends w/ Danny (short for Danielle) since they were 11 years                                    old.  	Danny—friends w/ Laura; nearly identical stories (gimme a break, we were only on the island two days)  	Sarah & Nikki—graphic designers from England; Sarah was cutey #2; read to her on the rainy day (which happened to begin with a sex scene…uncomfortable moment aside, it would unfortunately not become a sign of things to come);  Sarah seemed to be holding back, though obviously (to me, anyway) was a mischievous sprite.  Gareth, aka Gazz—4th year med student (at Warwick) from Liverpool; future breast cancer surgeon; Cool guy, fast friends; Met Ana/Leslie in the back of the  bus to the island;  Buddies w/ Steve Gerrard, a young soccer star for Liverpool;  Apparently Gazz is quite the footballer himself;  Loved Justin Timberlake on the island; degree in Medical Biochem;  Going to stay with us when he swings through Sydney.  Martha, Billy, & Harry—traveling family; Mom teaches teachers in Brighton; on a world tour collecting info for their family tree; Billy & Harry are the youngest  bartenders on the island; actually met them on the bus from the airport to the Nadi Bay Hotel.  What was really cool was how the island adopted the kids.  It wouldn’t seem like an island full of 19-25 year olds would be very fun for Mum and kids, but everyone took to them.  Mom did a lot of relaxing because she knew her kids were safe.  Everyone looked out for them, played with them, especially the staff.  Emma—Kiwi (that means she's from New Zealand); most beautiful girl on the island; Awesome personality, energy, attitude; traveling with her brother and friend, who ended up becoming BF/GF on the trip; at least that’s the closest to the story I could get from all of our collective memories.   Her and here brother were the foremen on the sand castle construction, with which I assisted.  David, Sally, feat/ Edna and Nick—David is a gold digger, seriously.  He looks for gold, how cool is that?  They are from Australia, but live in Nadi; Sally teaches  school; Edna is sweat little 4
