In my last blog, I had had pointed out a suggestion that a firm primarily exists because of the existence of marketing costs. But then a firm could keep growing and growing eliminating all market transactions. Obviously, there have to be certain reasons why this does not happen.  1) As the firm gets larger, the cost of doing transactions within the firm will increase rather than increase, as predicted. A point will be reached where the costs of organizing an extra transaction within the organization is equal to the costs involved in doing the same transactions in the open market. It could also be that another entrepreneur would be doing the same transaction at a lower cost.  2) As the firm grows larger, the value drawn from the factors of production is not maximized. The entrepreneur may fail to make the best use of the factors of production. In other words, a point will be reached when the loss on the firm through the wastage of resources is is equal to the marketing costs of the exchange transactions in the open market or by that being done by another entrepreneur.  In effect, the firm will expand till the cost of doing any extra transaction within the firm equals the cost of doing the same thing in the open market.  An interesting exception to the other rule is the combination of two such firms. A firm should only take over another whole organization only if the latters cost of doing a transaction and the cost of doing the transaction on the open market is less than the cost of the former doing it.  Other things being equal, a firm will tend to be larger  1) if the cost of organizing a transaction is lesser and the rate of change of these costs will increase with the increase in the transactions organized. 2) if the entrepreneur is less likely to make mistakes and the rate of increase of these mistakes decreases with the transactions organized within the firm. 3) if the cost of supplying factors of production to firms of larger size does not increase at a rapid rate.  This does tend to concur with our observations that larger firms tend to be inefficient within, however are able to compensate the same by commanding lesser transaction costs in the open market (they manage to sell by sheer size, or branding, etc.)
Most of us know that the economy exists because of the competing forces of supply and demand. But seldom have we questioned as to why it would be necessary to have organizations/firms in order to do the production? Outside of the firm, price movements direct production, which is coordinated through a series of transactions in the market. However, inside the firm, these transactions are eliminated and are instead replaced by an enterpreneur-coordinator who directs production. R.H.Coase was the first to ask such a question, and his theories became the foundation of what is called Coasian Economics. He asked: "If production is regulated by price movements, production could be carried on without any o
