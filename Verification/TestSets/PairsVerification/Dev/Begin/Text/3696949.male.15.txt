Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to this, the first post of my soon-to-be rant-laden weblog. I have a name and that name is not Bongo Bill, but you will know me as Bongo Bill because I have a healthy wariness of random Internet strangers knowing my full name. Perhaps one day I will decide otherwise and share with you all my name. But until then I am Bongo Bill, and don't you forget it.  This being a rant-oriented blog, I suppose I should begin with a rant. And since you are, in fact, looking at a blog, it is only fitting that I begin with a rant about blogs.  It is the greatest strength and the most critical weakness of weblogs as a medium of communication that anyone at all can own one. It is accessible to anyone who meets the simple requirements of being able to type and occasionally having access to that wonderful overgrown network, the Internet. And yet at the same time, because of the fact that anyone can make one, a blog begins with zero credibility as a source of information and insight. The lamentable truth is that the cause of this is the following train of thought: if anyone can do it, it must not be anything special; the chances are a thousand to one that a normal person's mundane weblog will have anything worthwhile, or will even be tolerable to read.  I have made this blog, using its greatest strength, fully confident that I can elevate it beyond that greatest weakness. This will be a blog where every post will hopefully present to the reader some insight into their own mind, some amusing bit of trivia, a hearty laugh, a complete paradigm shift, or a bit of fatal cardiac arrest (although honestly I don't plan to make much use of that last one).  The philosophy underlying my life changes from time to time as I drive myself to deeper realms of thought. At present it includes one tenet for which I am sure some of you will be grateful: the duty I have taken upon myself for my life is to deliver to others the sense of awe that accompanies the true understanding of a profound concept.  So in other words, you stick around here long enough, you're bound to learn something. Unless you're reading one of my political rants, in which case you'll either A) already agree with me, or B) not listen to me. I have never in my life been able to convert a person from one political ideology to another. That doesn't mean I won't stop trying, though. It's not my fault you're wrong, but I do what I can to help.
I wrote this a while back. I'm probably going to edit it and submit it, anonymously or otherwise to a couple of major publications. Anyhow, here it goes. I call it "In Defense of the Nice Guy."     Before I begin, let me say that my statements and generalizations are based off of legitimate social archetypes, also known as stereotypes. I
