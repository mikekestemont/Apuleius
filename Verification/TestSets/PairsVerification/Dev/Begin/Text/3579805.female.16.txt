Today was scary and fun all at the same time ya know that feeling? I think i like it. Someone attempted to kiss me. It was more or less a disaster but if u wanna know that story you can ask me.Despite that i still like him. Ya know what i love this blogger. Here its only about me and only my feelings count. I think everybody needs a place like that. I think im gonna watch gothika here a little bit. cuz i rollerbladed for about 30 minutes at full speed. It was fun after the sitting and watching shane and shawn and cam skate for like 4 hours maybe even more. What i got home at like quarter to 2 and went outside after about 15 minutes, was out for like 45 minutes alone until shane came and hung out with me. Hes a real cool kid. Hes never had a gf which i find hardto believe i think hes real cute. But i dont think i would date him cuz i need someone a little more mature and not in it for the sex. Ya know? Not that i would hav sex with him cuz i wouldnt. But ya know "the perks" of a relationship. Thats not me at all. I want someone to care about my feelings and well being more than "getting some" I think that most guys want that too, once theyre ready for a relationship. We're all human right everyone wants someone who loves them.So if everyone wants it why is it so damn hard to find......
I had a lot of fun at my party. I think i really like barry . Hes so cute and hes nice. My uncle hates him but i dont care. Because i like him and thats all that counts. I wish to date him. I was looking at his eyes and  almost kissed him. I really wanted to. I stopped myself. He stuck his hand down my shirt to get his keys back....i didnt hate it.....all in all a good day today my party tomorrow the mall...monday, THE WORLD..... RETRACTION-i do not wish to date barry.... i dont even really like him that much. I was on a party high. He said the RUDEST thing to danielle. joey went and sat in the floor ad barry said if you grow your hour and ye it blonde joey might pay attention to you. WHAT AN ASSHOLE maybe thats why he doesnt have a gf.....
