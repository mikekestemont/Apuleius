I can never remember to get my blogs in on time, I keep forgetting about doing it!  I really want to be doing this on a daily basis, but life can be too frenetic at times!  Yesterday I spent most of the morning adding a main switch into the electrics so that I don't have to keep pulling the fuse to work on the new consumer unit.  The house needs so much electrical work doing on it, I thought it best to try and make the task as safe as possible in future.  Problem is, all the wires you aren't legally allowed to change, were too short!  Never mind got round it in the end!  Spent most of the day in the garden, trimming the tree, continuing the never ending shed base foundations, taking up the old garden path, all whilst watching the kids!  Evern got time to wash the car.  What a difference a bit of sunshine makes!  Temperature must be about 13 degrees, which in the scheme of things is really quite warm, giving that it has been frosty for the last few weeks.  Anyway I have just kind of realised that blogging, potentially is a flawed medium - by this I mean that if I have a different take on a situation, whether it be world news or my mates barbeque - then if I pour out my thoughts in a blog and others don't like it, then it can cause problems.  So blogs are never going to be out pouring of the heart, unless you are very secure in the knowledge that you are not going to annoy someone close to you.
Time to blog - why - why not - it seems to be the done thing of course!
Busy week - so not really had time to blog - the war is still going on, but it has just become part of everyday life as these things tend to do, unfortunately.
Ok I'm bored of the war now - doesn't mean I won't pass occasional comment, but I think we are just getting information overload now - perhaps too much information, and definately not all accurate!  Today I'm back in the office, having been to Birmingham yesterday, oh the joys of being on the road - I'm probably back to Birmingham tomorrow!  Started working on my car last night only to find that nearly every bolt I wanted to undo was seized, so today I've made a management decision - I'm going to pay someone else to do it all!  Can't afford it but hey thats never stopped me before.  Also found out today that my boys adenoid operation has been delayed - whats the point of going private if the operation still gets delayed?!
On a much less serious note this looks kind of cool -  urlLink VNC - Virtual Network Computing from AT&T Laboratories Cambridge   As does this -  urlLink Dynamic DNS, Static DNS for Your Dynamic IP
