My old man doesn't know me very well... he doesn't know what makes me cry, what makes me laugh; he doesn't know what I dream about, what or whom I long for in the blue shadows of the night.  My old man doesn't know where love has taken me... whom I've loved and lost, whom I've used and been used by; he doesn't know who has broken my heart, nor any of those whose hearts I've broken in my ongoing journey to myself.  My old man doesn't know me very well... but he loves me anyway... and perhaps, just perhaps, none of the rest matters much when all is said and done.  Â©2004 neverending rainbow enterprises, ltd.

We didn't fall asleep during John Kerry's acceptance speech at the end of the Democratic Convention last night.&nbsp; With the purposely lowered expectations that qualified as a homerun for the candidate.&nbsp; (Maybe it was just my imagination, but it seemed like both his wife and his running mate looked bored and disconnected at times while watching the speech...)   And so back to the campaign trail for Kerry-Edwards...with both "hope" and "help" apparently being on the way for us all...until the GOP puts on their own carefully micro-managed pageant next month.&nbsp; And then we will slog through September and October with, despite Kerry's somewhat disingenuous call to take the campaign to the "higher ground" (dude, that trick   never   works :-), increasingly negative back and forth.&nbsp; (In this I am glad that California is not really "in play" which will, hopefully, leave the candidates to spend their ad dollars elsewhere.)   And so it goes.   &nbsp;
I hope that John Kerry will indeed be the last Presidential candidate who needs to...or can...use the Vietnam War as a recurring theme in his or her campaign (or as a bludgeon to use against his opponent.)&nbsp; I don't want to forget it...it is an informing scar on our collective history that should forever teach us lessons about the way we deal with the world...but I'm tired of it being used as a litmus test for the Presidency.&nbsp;   I was 17 when the war ended (I remember this well because as I neared my majority my mother and I disagreed on what role I might take if it were still going on when I was eligible for the draft...I was, however naively,&nbsp;leaning towards serving because that's what the country might ask me to do; &nbsp;she was adamantly opposed to that path for what she saw as a pointless war)...31 years later it is still informing our political discourse with disproportionate emphasis.&nbsp;   John Kerry's service in the war was brave and worthwhile (as was, in my opinion, his willingness to protest the war after returning home) but I'm more interested in hearing his ideas for the future than reliving his exploits from decades in the past.&nbsp; Constantly using his former shipmates and other Vietnam veterans as props for his campaign comes off as exploitive and cynical. (Yeah I know...imagine that, &nbsp;cynical exploitation in a political campaign...that   never   happens :-)   Presidents B
