Wake up and brush the stench of automation from your mouth.  I feel the pain of Walt Liquor in my liver and understand.  No we are not the only pilots of the car, but think of how much further and the interesting places you can visit with a co-pliot that can actually drive...  No time?  Time is relative! Time is all around us!  "Time is on my side...yes it is!" -Rolling Stones  Pierce the matrix and make time.  But we must wake up first Neo.  My pre, during, and post wedding thoughts go un recorded in my beautiful leather bound journal collecting dust in the roach infested bedroom furniture currently being used as my living room furniture.  Ink is drying up and not being scrolled like some ancient manuscripts.  So I figure, let's start our writers club again.  This is a call of transformations...from the carefree "woohoo!"-ers we were to the argumentative, intropsective, interrupting "Ehqumi!" we would like to become again.  Pick a day, any day, and make it yours.  We eagerly await Tuesday's for a bit of Chaunscience or Wednesday's for Dj Meli Mel or whatever...  It's the only way to keep our sanity.   See you next tuesday...  Chaunsee
They say that the future is built on the past.  All ideas spring foward from old ideas.  Therefore, the more of the past that is accessible the more we can create.  I think it's pretty much understood that creativity makes this world just a bit much more enjoyable.  We escape our mundae lives into different forms of creativity.  Movies, music, books, dancing...each of those creative endeavors builds on past traditions.  So why are multimedia companies trying to destroy the future?  They key element to involved with the distribution and usage of ideas is wrapped up in intellectual property (IP).  When I create an idea, it is my intellectual property.  A song, a poem, a picture...all intellectual property.  Man made laws have been created to protect the creator of these works.  People cannot use your creations without your permission.  Sounds fair doesn't it?  I wouldn't want people claiming they wrote something when in reality I wrote it...or would I?  Maybe if I was the type of guy that thought someone else can improve on what I created, then I wouldn't have a problem with someone else using it.  As long as it grew and became something else.  Taking in something that exists, transforming it, and (re)producing it is the basis for Hiphop conciousness, my first CD "food for thought", my second CD "It aint the coffee in my kitchen", all works based or influnced by past works (basically all art), and a new CD i'm working on tentatively titled "It's the soundtrack to this moment: Monkey Magic".  As I said in the liner notes of "It aint the coffee...", the english language has many words which are reused everyday in different contexts.  Why can't IP be used in the same decontextualized way?    There's so much more to this idea of Intellectual property.  My thoughts are a little sporadic right now and hopefully g
