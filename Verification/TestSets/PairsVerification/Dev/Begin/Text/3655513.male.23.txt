So it is 11:14pm MST, and here I sit in my bedroom fixing the personal computer of the personnel director from my job. Not that I mind doing it, but I wonder sometimes at how often I find myself fixing someone else's computer as a favour. I'm glad to be able to love and minister to people this way, but where is the line drawn where it comes to the point that you are being taken advantage of?  The last couple of weeks, I've been staying up late reading and such, so I was looking forward to hitting the sack early, until I realized it would be more prudent to get this computer out of my bedroom and back into its owner's hands. *laugh* No rest for the weary, right?  So I found myself watching Joe Schmo 2 again tonight. I think it is my new favorite show. Just hilarious. Quite crude at points, but still just hilarious.

I'm quite looking forward to it, and really can't wait to be dancing again. Hopefully it won't end up costing me too much.  Anyways, back to work then on to bed. Oh to dream..........  Shalom.

Man, I can't begin to understand how that works.  Life is busy for me at the moment. Working hard daily, fixing computers for friends in my evenings, and keeping very involved with my church. (Leading a musical worship team often, and ministering as a youth leader). Jenny and I find time for each other as much as possible, and I try and keep my social life balenced by hanging out with my roomates and friends as well.  Speaking of friends, I've come to some disturbing conclusions today whom I can count as such in the bunch of people I work with. For the second time in a row, I find myself purposefully not invited to a social gathering by the same young lady here at work. This young lady works in an affiliated department in my division, and as a division we are all relatively the same age and social standing. Thus we work as a division and play as a division. I have always gotten along well with this young lady (so I thought), yet for the 2nd time in the l
