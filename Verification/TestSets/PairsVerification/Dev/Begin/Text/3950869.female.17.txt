I got back Sunday afternoon.  It was a fun wk for me at least.  Not too sure if my brother and sister had as much fun as I do, but they normally don't like hanging out with the family up north.   Monday I put my two wks in at Wendy's.  Yup-next wk is my last wk of being employed.  Two days after I came back home Ashley decides to be stupid-runs off again.  Of course the consequences get worse.  Now she has one of those tracking devices that are worn on the ankle. Her life is on a downward spiral.  But last night we found her and my mom dropped her off at the police station and they had court today(that's when she got the anklet thingy).    Today was a pretty good day for me.  Nothing too extraordinary.  Woke up at 8:00(which is a suprise, especially with no alarm), took my sweet time to get ready for the day, then went up to my old alma marter(sp?).  I saw some of my old band buddies-it was nice.  Then Kelly and I went to La Fiesta to eat.  After all that I went to Biloxi.    The doctors scared the crap out of me.  They made me think that I was going to have to get two or three shots. HA ha.  Tomorrow night my mom and me are going out shopping for dorm stuff. Yee haw.

Serendipity means a fortunate mistake or accident...Today while in New York City we went by there(inspired by watching the movie "Serendipity").&nbsp;It's an ice cream shop/restaurant. &nbsp;Although we didn't get to eat there b/c the wait was too long.&nbsp; So I took&nbsp;a picture o
