It is utterly amazing how people can lie to one another, or ask others to lie for them with out a second thought.  I mean really the only thing that we do to each other is dilute the victim and give them a false sense of security. The best thing to do is to tell others your true thoughts on the subject at hand, this will help develop better relationships with the few people that you do not offend.  The real problem is that most of us were raised to lie in an effort to spare someone’s feelings, but really you are only creating problems for your self later on in life (thanks mom).    An example would be some of my ex-girlfriends.  Three of my four past girlfriends have plumped becoming larger than my preference.  I was thinking of  a nice way to tell my last mate to lose some weight (keep in mind that I am not as shallow as most, but the shift in weight was abnormal).  A friend told me to “use the English language.” He went on this spiel about how women will better deal their current suitor for someone with a better active profile (income, car, etc.).  He seemed pretty bitter but the essence of the message was clear; tell this person the truth.  This would make everyone’s life easier if  everyone whom received these messages would just accept the fact that those pants make you look fat, or your girlfriend does sort of look like you.  It is not always meant to be an act of cruelty, the honesty is refreshing and may make you a better person in the long run. It might even lower the divorce rate in the US.  Just a thought, but if you think my idea sucks then say so.
Would the world be a better place if we shot all useless and moronic people?  Would we be happier with a smaller population, more focus on individual achievement, art, and science? Or am I delusional and subconsciously violent toward those whom cannot benefit me, themselves, or others even though they seem to have a normal IQ?
It is mind boggling how many people spawn duplicates of themselves. And it seems like chances are most of these replicas are not planned or initially wanted.  I will soon jump off of the cruise ship of irresponsibility into the cramped space of real life and parenthood in a few months because my EX-girlfriend says that she is having my child and she wants to keep it.  My view on the Pro-choice issue is irrelevant right now because I really do not have a say in the matter but I am going to be in the child’s life if it is mine.  How did this happen?  Well it is your classic case of “heat of the moment syndrome.”  I can honestly say that I did make an effort to grab a condom but my efforts were forted. I can also not say that this situation is not my fault, but I do wish I would h
