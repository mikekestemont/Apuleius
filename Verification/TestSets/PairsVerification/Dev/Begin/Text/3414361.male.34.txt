It was 1993 she merits the status of Doctor cos quite frankly she was superb on so many levels in my book Maybe it was the age difference I was 23 she was 18...although she coulda been 17 I really can't remember  we met one day at the local coffee shop she brought her friend to be on the safe side but we met because I was making a Zine and had seen that she was a local poet and I loved her work  I thought she had a swell eye for creativity and I had wanted her to add some depth to my Zine..she had a keen design style as well, ( i was making my zine from a word processor so there was no change in the font unless things were hand written) she had developed some fonts of her own and by the 2nd issue I asked her to be my co-editor and let her design some of the layout using the font and finding more creative people up her way at college by the time she was attending college   i had fallen for her hard   although it seemed we never really spoke that much on the phone spent alot of time saying  "uh huh"  nervous energy i guess  one of the first times we went out we went bowling and i made subtle moves on her while bowling she didn't seem to mind although what sticks out in my mind is later that night at a diner  i asked her a question..i can't recall what I said but she responded with "Is that a loaded question?" I then asked..what ? Is that a phrase from where you live ? I had never heard of a loaded question so I had no clue what she meant. So she just said to skip it.  a year goes by and we sparingly go out a few times more...more friendly dates than anything by Valentines day of 1995 we are still not really talking on the phone..(although in person conversation flows at ease) I decide to make a video journal of my life and at that time confessed on tape to how much I was falling in love with her...and sent her a bear that I had won at a carnival..it was the only thing I had ever won and I wanted to give it to someone special so I picked Doctor S#1  That Summer we found ourselves working the same job...not the same department but enuff time to pretty much hang out at work during work events. We performed together during a karaokee contest and did it spur of the moment ( i even borrowed someones yellow raincoat to fit in) we won on all levels of Judging..it was a blast the fact that we seemed to gel at least creatively   i thought for sure I had found the woman of my dreams   we went golfing one time too and i showed the finer points of how to stand..really close to your partner when learning to swing upon coming b
