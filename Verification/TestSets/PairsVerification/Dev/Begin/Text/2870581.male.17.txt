SO much FUN.  Okay, now that I'm not totally fucked up, go  urlLink here  to get my scoop, so I don't have to type a bunch of stuff over again.  It's somewhere in that entry, under crap about church and all.  So...yeah.  I love my friends.  I want to go to the park now.  Dammit, I don't have anyone to go with.  No one is online.  -zr/k
I woke up this morning to a small hangover for over consumption of chocolate and other great things. Hopefully my Birthday Bash will be as great as that one!    "Do you like your coffee like your men?  Dark and strong?" "No...white and sweet."    "I am so FUCKED up!"  "What's wrong Mary?" "She doesn't like fleshy things" "COVER UP THE CHICKEN!  AAARRRGGHHHHH"  *watches Karyn zip around the kitchen with dirty plates while I stuff my face with chocolate strawberries and bananas*  Ahh...yes...random quotes and actions.
OMG. My party was the bomb. I have never had a party quite like that ever. I have had a few awesome Halloween parties, but never an awesome birthday party. My 15th we had fondue, but it was really nothing, no dancing or anything. My 16th we had my party in a garage. And it's always been really cold. But anyways this party was so freaking awesome. Everybody really enjoyed themselves and we just totally rocked. There was the movie, h'ors de orvres, a little tapenade with crackers, and shrimp sushi rolls, which Jessica managed to down 3 of them. Then there was the cheese that took forever to boil, and Mary being afraid of the chicken flesh, and the grape juice toast, and Karyn staring at the Disaronno Amaretto, and the cooking, and all of the chocolate in it's most luxurious power...Spilling on Katie. Then there was Cranium, the order of these things is not correct. Then the rave, the rave hmmm.... what can we say. Loud blaring music, fog, lights, room spinning, people falling playing with Karyn's car, what a rush, then sitting on the back deck, so we didn't hyperventilate then well it was before, Karyn drinking a mug of espresso. And the infamous "The 7 Hour Movie" lots of laughs. I really wish the people that were here tonight could have been in some of the scenes of the movie. Good times galore. On a scale of 1-10, last night was like a 15. It was so great. Actually the last past two weeks have been the best this year. Hopefully summer brings us more trips to Manhattan, the lake, and the mountains, or perhaps the beach. I miss the Florida Keys...Esp. for some weird reason, I miss Lake Surprise, so mysterious, so beautiful, I love Key West. This day will go down i
