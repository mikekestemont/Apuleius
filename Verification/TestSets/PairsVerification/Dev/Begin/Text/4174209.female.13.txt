This is my indept version of My Song - since i know a lot of u out there want to know what i was thinking when i wrote my poems and stories - so i'm starting with the first one i posted. NOTE: When this poem was written, it was supposed to be an exageration of today's world. Wat this world might become (keep that in mind)            My Song       Blinded by Imaginary Light   - The prase Imaginary Light - used alot in my poem - means something lyk this: If light is fake (and light allows you to see everything) then what is real (since this "fake light" is blinding you, and showing you the world wrongly - it is making it seem lyk the world is wonderful - but really, their is deceit and lies and trachory...This "fake light" is showing a "fake world". I hope that kinda helps you understand my description of "imaginary light" Remember..."If light if fake, than what if real?"    Forged from A childâ€™s laughter And a burning tongue of Hate,     -  The imaginary light involves innocence "a child's laughter" (I used somthing lyk innocence because the "fake light" wants you to think it is real) and something evil - here the phrase "a burning tongue of hate" could mean an acual tongue saying horrible stuff - or could be thought of more as fire, lyk a tongue of flame, something that consumes everything in it's path - as Hate so offten does...     Who is to blame For this misinterpretation Of right And wrong?     -  Basically, this means that the world turned into a place where being bad looks good, or it is ok to get your vengance, and even on more or less extreme levels. And it is asking "Who started this? Why is that allowed?"...      This is my song     - This is where the peom gets it's name. I repeat it again and again meaning somethign lyk: This is wat i live by, this is what is out there, this is my dream, my hope, my attempt, my worse nightmare....ect....etc (however u spell it lol)      Surrounded by A substance of Shadows     - Shadows are basically nothing. They are the result of light being blocked out. Basically, the imaginary light hides the real world from us. When it is blocked out, the result is a shadow - something dark and scary, that shows the "true world" dark and scary (as told in the poem). Also the "substance" part is that shadows are nothing, so they can't be made of someting...in this poem they   are   made of something...    Made of Something A nonentity A hidden identity Mistrust of thought Teasing And tricking    - ...In this poem, the shadows are made of secrets and lies and trickery, all that stuff that lead to major problems between friends, enemies, countries, familis....Its sad isn't it?     And mistaking Weak from Strong, This is my Song    - did you ever realize that bad peeps are always picking on those more helpless, less strong, and more innocent? Just wanted to point i
