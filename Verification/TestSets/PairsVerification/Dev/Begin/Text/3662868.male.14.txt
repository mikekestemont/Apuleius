Well, this is where I'm going to move my desensatized story...more to come soon.
The effects of the creation of my blog shown in easy to read numbers: 2 People I know have created their own after viewing mine  2 of my friends are members of my blog  0 of them are active in the means of posting (they do leave comments though...)  98.9% of you have stopped asking me about things in my life  0 people have left negative comments  3 people have been flamed by me  2 people with blogs who live in Rockville read my posts  1 of them is Becky, who I am madly in love with  1 of them is a serial killer...lol  (This number has not been proven scientifically, but I think it's safe to say that...) 100% of you enjoy reading my posts, even if they are just me ranting about nothing. :)                                             See you space cowboy...

It seemed as if they were all too busy, and freaked out, and trying to order themselves to order any kids around. I passed one of my friends in the hall, "Hey, do we have to sign or check in anywhere?" I asked as he casually walked by me.
