So nothing goes as planned in my life, i was going to go to lowes and pick up some stuff for the basement and then hang drywall the rest of the day. But instead my dad decided to cut the grass this morning and the lawn mower broke, so i fixed it, but that took a while. Then on the way to the store i got stuck in traffic and in long lines in the store, so by the time i got home it was time for dinner. After i ate i dint fell like hanging any drywall because it is almost impossible to hang it on the ceiling by ur self, and i was the only one home. So know i guess i have to hang as much as i can tomorrow before i go to work, but who know if that will happen.

Its easier to update and i dont have to worry about it being shut down. Ive kind of been a lazy mother f****r for the last week, i didnt shave and i just sat around most of the day. Today i realized that doing that sucks, i cut the grass, went for a ride on my bike, and shaved, also im going to go to the store in the morning to get some stuff i need for the basement and then im going to work down there most of the day and try to get all that i can possibly get hung. I have to work on thursday, but im going to try to hang some before i have to go to work, b/c i dont have to go in late. I should have another post tomorrow, but in the mean time, keep in touch, jdim05, expertgamer428@yahoo.com

I had to go to the hospital again to get some x-rays done, and it took around 2 HOURS!!! Ans during the x-rays the pain started to come back b/c the dye was pushing on some of the stones, and they could give me any pain killers so i had to lay there, not beeing aloud to move,&nbsp;feeling like some one was icking me in my nuts and i had a fat woman standing on top of me for 2 hours! And then when i got home i had to drink 10 glases of water to flush the dye out, b/c it can be toxic if left in the kidneys to long, so i have been going to the bathroom all day. But the only good thing was t
