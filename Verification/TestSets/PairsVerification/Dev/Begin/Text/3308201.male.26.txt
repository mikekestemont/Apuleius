I LOVE female singers to death. Everyone from Etta to Janis to Tori to...Amy Lee? That's right, I said it. Say what you will about the "popness" or the "christianity(sp?) of their music, but goddamn has she got a voice. Nothing turns me on more than a moving female voice. It started, for me, with Janis. To this day you can't compare the emmotion she projected. Over the years, there have been many equals (within different genres), and silent supporters who carry on the torch of what she stood for and represented through that era of emerging blues/rock. I commend them completely. Even Pink, who soon will be playing and singing the role of the immortal legend that is Janis.  I'm veering away from my point as usual. Jains was the shit, same with Etta James, Nina Simone, Diana Ross & Gladys Knight. Myself, I'm a product of the 80's and Stevie Nicks was my beloved songbird (no pun intended).Right now, Amy Lee...fuck. Operatic with an attitude. You cant ask for more at all. I really hope she goes further than just the pop/rock scene because she honestly has the talent. Obviously, we'll see. But this is what I hope.
Didn't do shit Friday because Thursday night my friend and I simply destoyed ourselves like the obedient alcoholics we are (I don't think I've consumed that much liquer in a a REALLY long time). Bike rode most of Saturday, ran around doig errands, paying bills and what not. Caught Greyboy at the H.O.B. (see previous post). Today, biked around a little bit, went into work for a few hours. Only to find out that my new office, which was being built this weekend, is literally HALF the size of my current one. This is NOT going to work...ugh!! Now I'm chilling out, listeing to Ryan Adams "Demolition", and trying to finish up my Coachella review (yes Claire, it's coming). Tonight is the second to last episode of the Sopranos...so sad, yet so thrilling. Couple drinks at the bar after that to cap off the weekend, then back to hell tomorrow.
Saw these trmendous musicians last night at the House of Blues L.A. They played a searing 3 hours of non stop jazz/funk/soul/R&B fusion. Talent ooozes out of each the band members pores.  Learn all about Greyboy Allstars    I first got into this band seeing Karl Denson's Tiny Universe open up for the Dave Matthews Band a few years back. If either Greyboy, KDTU, or Robert Walter's 20th Congress ever come around, I highly suggest checking them out.
I'll start off with a quote:   I dig music -Russell Hammond, Almost Famous  That pretty much sums up how I feel about it. With a lack of a better quote off the top of my head. There is nothing I dislike about it, and with the passionate love that I have for it, I feel like I have every right to critique it with total emmotion. My main love is Rock and Roll. So if I ever knock any rap, country, pop/mainstream...it's just me either a. n
