I just tried to post a comment on Jason's (8's) Xanga site and it won't let me unless I sign up....  dumb.   you should drink the Kool Aid and get a blogger account like the rest of us.
I just spellchecked my last post and the replacement suggestion for "freakin'" was "foreskin!"  nice.
So I played some poker last Friday night.  I actually played from about 10pm until 6am Saturday morning.  It was wonderful.  And, now that I've been back, I can't wait to go again.  I made enough to pay my Sugardaddy back and have a bit left over for myself.  It's a beautiful thing to walk up to the cage with a couple racks of chips and watch the cashier count them up and convert 'em to cash.  Anyway, I played a little bit of Hold'em while I was waiting for a spot on the Half and Half table to open up.  At the HnH table they play 1 round of Hold'em and 1 round of Omaha and then do it all over again (a round being one full rotation of the dealer button.)  I had never played Omaha in the casino before so it was a great learning experience.  I decided that I'll play the HnH table in the future.  For those that don't know, allow me to explain Omaha.  It's kinda like Hold'em but not.  You get 4 cards in your hand and 5 community cards are dealt.  You make the best 5 card poker hand out of any 2 of your hole cards and any 3 of the community cards.  It's a beautiful game with more possibilities and bigger pots than the average limit Hold'em game.  I recommend playing online before you put any real money into a game of Omaha....and for God's sake, fold your freakin' hand if the board pairs and you don't have a full house...cuz someone does!!
I'm going to be playing poker this weekend with a friend of mine.  He's bankrolling me so that I can play at the high limit tables.  I was supposed to go with him a few weeks ago but he had a bad run and needed some time to build up both his tolerance and funds.    I had a lot of success when I first started playing poker but it's been a while since I've played so I feel I need a bit of a refresher.  So for this installment of my blog (God I hate saying that word) I'm going to list a few rules and standards that I've reminded myself of in preparation for this weekends gaming.     A Strong Foundation    When I first started playing this was the strategy that paid for my wedding. ('s' denotes suited cards and 'x' denotes any card)    Early Position   Raise with AA, KK and AKs  from any position. Call with AK, AQs, KQs, and QQ and fold everything else.    Middle Position   Call with JJ, TT, 99, 88 AJs, QJs, AQ, KQ.    Late Position   Call with AXs, KTs, JTs, AJ, AT.  This is actually a little different from what I would p
