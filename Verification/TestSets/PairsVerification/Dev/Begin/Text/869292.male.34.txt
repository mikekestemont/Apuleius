As some of you know, Superstar Billy Graham (the former pro wrestler that received Kate's liver donation) is writing an autobiography and has asked me to design the cover of the book. Here's an update...     This is where we're at right now. We still have to add some text to the front at the bottom. And I'm sure Simon & Schuster will have something to say about it since they are publishing the book, but essentially this is it. It's been fun working on this project and I can't wait to see it on a book shelf at Barnes & Noble!
In case you were wondering what my computer screen looks like...  This is pretty much it at any given time. I'm organizing some photos in this picture, plus listening to iTunes and chatting with friends on iChat.
urlLink Pixar's  "Finding Nemo" has surpassed Disney's "The Lion King" to become the top-grossing animated film ever.     Pixar's "Finding Nemo" has surpassed Disney's "The Lion King" to become the top-grossing animated film ever. "Finding Nemo" brought in $313.1 million in nine weeks vs. Lion King's $312.9 million.  Janet and I took my nephew to see the movie and we all thought it was fantastic. I never thought I would see the day when I believed that an animated movie for kids was the best movie of the year!  All I can say is, "Mine, Mine, Mine, Mine, Mine!"
Janet and I have both been working pretty hard lately, so this past weekend we decided to run and hide in the Arizona mountains...  A family member has a nice cabin in Prescott, AZ - just a few hours drive from Phoenix. We drove up on Friday night and stayed until Sunday. It was a fantastic trip, and while only two days, it provided some much need rest for both of us.  We took a short hike (short because my knee started acting up - apparently it isn't completely healed from surgery), fed lots of birds and chipmunks, and watched a grouchy hummingbird guard a feeder.  We took a few pictures, which I hope to post as soon as we get them developed, so check back soon to see them!
The trip to work from a visual perspective. Just a few photos of my commute to the office each day. Some photos taken while I was actually driving - not exactly the poster child for safe driving am I?  I traded in my great job in Vegas with an 8-minute commute with literally no traffic at all, to move to Phoenix where I have to battle bumper-to-bumper traffic for 45-minutes each way! What????  Here's a teaser photo taken while driving to work, as well as the final destination. You can view the full trip in the  urlLink photo album .
I saw this on a web site today and thought it was hilarious.... but then again, I grew up in the Midwest!
