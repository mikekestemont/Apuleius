Seren now sounds like Elmer Fud. She says, "Hel-wo". Too cute. :)
Well, to all my local readers, my summer school is taught by the local weather man, AJ Fox. Too bad it wasn't Kopi! :) Before I took the class, I thought he was going to be cool because he is on TV. But in reality, he is nothing more than a odd person. I say this because he is not too funny, and just kinda weird. He sure is not someone who I would be friends with. Then again, who really cares? I'm mean.   Some other issues on my mind. School. Okay, yes I'm in school now. But what about when I get my Bachelors? What will I do next? I wanted to be a teacher for a long time, but then changed my mind. For a couple reasons, but mainly for Seren. If I am a teacher, I will not be able to volunteer at her class. I will not be able to go on field trips with her. I will spend a lot of extra time working. Plus, will I really be a good teacher? So I decided that I would try to attend a Master's program at Fresno State (Early Childhood Education). I called a woman who is in charge of the program. She tried to tell me that I should not attend and get my teaching credential instead. Gee, thanks for the advice. On the other hand, I have people at work who tell me that I should go to school to get my Library Science degree, and become a children's librarian. But the question is, what do I want to do?
Well, it's the truth. And I have no news. I wanted this to be a journal, but do I really want to put all my private things on the internet? I do know that I do love to write, and this helps me do that....obviously. :)  Summer school starts tomorrow. Just this one class left and I will graduate! Yeeeeah hawwww! I will have my BS in Child Development. I guess that means I should be somewhat of an expert in children. I'm not so sure about that, but I can say with confidence that I do know a lot about the little guys. :)  I use to work at a daycare a few years ago. Today at the library (the new one), I saw two of the little ones who attended the daycare. They didn't recognize me, but I remembered them. Isn't it funny that I was apart of raising those two? So many young adults start off in a daycare setting, and so many I would not trust my own child with. I remember the first job I had at a daycare. I was in charge of 12 toddlers. I had to help potty train them and provide a stimulating curriculum for them at the same time. I was only 19, maybe 20. I was so young and "wet behind the ears". (Oh, I'm full of the sayings tonight!) If I could g
