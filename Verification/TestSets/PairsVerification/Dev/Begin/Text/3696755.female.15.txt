I wanna fall in love, real love, with someone who wants to fall in love with me. I wanna wake up in the morning thinking about someone and go to bed knowing there thinking of me. I wanna laugh, and cry with someone all in the same day. I wanna know that this person is here for me, and wants to see and be with me. I wanna spend my time with him playing, talking, sleeping, anything as long as i was with him and it was right. I wanna walk with him, and have him hold my hand, and be happy. I wanna be happy. I wanna light up when i see his name on the caller id just to sit and talk to him for hours about nothing. I wanna be able to have some where to go, and always have somthing to do. I wanna fight with him just to make up seconds later. I wanna be able to make him a promise and no i wont break it. I wanna have nothing, but feel like i have everything. I wanna get a phone call from him just becasue he wanted to tell me he was thikning about me and that he loved me. I wanna dream about him and wake up and have him tell me he drempt about me. I wanna no he fells the same way. I dont wanna care what everyone else thinks. I dont wanna have to question what i feel for him. I dont wanna cry my self to sleep. I dont wanna hurt him. I dont wanna be hurt. I dont wanna be afraid of what tomorrows ganna bring. I dont wanna look at someone else and second guess what i have.

Wait for ones to come and go, wait for the day, that i realize, that ive found that person, and that im in love. I can count the minuts, i can count the hours, i can count the days, i can count the years, but it wont make it come any faster. So like i said, i guess ill just wait....
Why is there always those few people you cant bring your self to tell them that you like them? Im the kind of person that if I like you, you'll no. Because I figure, you may like me too and not ever tell me and well both never no. What's the worst that can happen? You'll say no, and well go back to the way things were, big deal. And Im sure a lot of you are like that too. But there's always those few, the ones that just i
