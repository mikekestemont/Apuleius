You know what pisses me off?  People who get a paper cut and bitch about it for twenty minutes.  There aren't that many things to say about a paper cut that aren't already common knowledge.  It's always the same whines, too.  Wow, it's so amazing that such a little cut can hurt so badly.  Or, omigosh, it's bleeeeeeding!  Everyone has had a damn paper cut, we don't need a narration of the trauma.  Most people have even had one that bled.  It's not worth yammering about for longer than 10 seconds.    I also don't need to know about the band-aid you put on your paper cut that miraculously heals as it covers, or the time you gave a band-aid to a man who had a paper cut.    I'm a little irritated today, in case you can't tell.  It might be because I'm tired, and just getting un-hungover, and stayed up until 2 when I have to get up at 5:30.  But if I were a betting person, I would place the blame for my churlishness on people bitching about paper cuts.
One of the big bonuses of living and working north of Waco is getting Dallas radio stations.  Don't get me wrong, I love my 102.5 and NPR, but you just can't beat 97.1 The Eagle's Mandatory Metallica and lots of classic Pantera in the morning.  97.1 also provides a great place to hear the local bands and find out about upcoming events.    Imagine my surprise when I tuned into my favorite station on Tuesday morning.  They were playing Elton John's song about his blind brother Daniel, and I assumed it was part of a morning show joke.  I flipped the station a few times, returned to Preset #4 and was greeted with Billie Myers' "Kiss the Rain".  What the hell?  With no warning,  urlLink Clear Channel Communications  changed the only real rock station in the greater Metroplex area to crappy lite muzak.  They should have gone ahead and changed the call letters to KSUK, or KGAY, or KRAP, I could go on.    I have nothing against lite rock.  I just want an alternative (pun intended).    Damn you, Clear Channel!  Check out  urlLink this  link.  It rocks.
Well.  Not only did I just foil a potential sexual predator, in doing so I also set a personal record for the route I was running.  Go me!  I run about 25 miles a week.  Usually, I run in the mornings anytime between 5:30 and 11am, depending on my schedule and level of motivation.  From my house I have a 3 mile loop and a 6 mile loop that I like, both of which are on scenic, quiet roads.  Unfortunately for my Olympic running aspirations, as of late, I have been leaving for work around 6, meaning that it's dark when I actually have time to run (as if I would get up at 4:30).  I decided to switch my running to the evenings.  Tonight at 8, the sun was still up, the sky was blue, and I set out on the 6 mile route.  I
