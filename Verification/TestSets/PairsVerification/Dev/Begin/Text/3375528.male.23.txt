There is a need for the censorship of broadcast media however, if censorship proceeds with no limits, broadcasters will have their first amendment rights infringed upon. The freedoms of the first amendment guarantee the freedom of speech and press through the United States Constitution. Under no circumstances should the rights guaranteed under the constitution ever become marginalized. If the bill of rights becomes marginalized a precedent is set to further reduce the rights given Americans for any reason the government sees fit.  	The debate over media censorship is focused on the definition of indecent. More so what exactly can be considered an indecent topic for broadcasters. This concept of indecent is a complex idea to comprehend. Mostly the term is complicated because there is not a set definition indecent.

The only terms that are excluded by the bill are so called fighting words and obscenity. Fighting words encompass hate rhetoric. Also included is the theater example, i.e. the yelling of fire in a crowded theater that is not on fire is subject to persecution. Obscenity can also be persecuted under the first amendment because it offers no substantive value. Currently as defined any infringement of speech on a broadcaster is a violation of their first amendment rights, unless the subject matter can be considered obscene or hate rhetoric.  	The most confusing aspect of this situation is the FCC has no authority to restrict the airways. The commission was created solely to manage the broadcast spectrum so that two stations were not broadcasting on the same signal too closely. In addition, the FCC is also in charge of delegating the call letters out for stations. The telecommunications act of 1934, the act that created the FCC explicitly limits the FCC’s ability to r
