Saturday 22 May 2004(Arizona’s Time)    Arrived at 1:30pm at Tucson International Airport, an hour’s drive away from Sierra Vista. The moment I saw Dar, the emotional build up over the past 24 hours suddenly overpowered me and I cried. Thankfully, we were in public, so conscious me controlled myself.  Luggage was delayed, so we arranged for it to be sent to our place in 4 hours’ time. We drove through Tucson City, and though it was bigger and more modern than I thought it’d be, I was still a little disappointed. Where were the people on a Saturday afternoon???? Definitely not Orchard Road!!!  We reached “home” – place we will be for the next 4 months – at about 3 plus. 1555 E. Busby Dr Apartment C319 Vista De La Sierra Apartments, Sierra Vista, AZ 85635. A simple set up of 2 brm, 1 bath, 1 small kitchen and a small living room. My first thought? Nice…..  We drove to the nearby shopping malls to take a look, and also to get some daily necessities. Kept reminding myself that it’s US$ we’re talking here, so cannot “shop till I drop”. At Wal-Mart, we bought sundries, pillows, etc……then proceeded to Target (miss Australia already) and walked slowly down every aisle. Then went to Fry’s to get groceries…..everything was in Singapore pricing but in US$. Definitely going to eat in everyday and try to save money here.  The tax here is unbelievable! 9%!

Seeing all those stuff that my parents bought for us makes me miss them so much. I sms them and wait for their reply.  Night’s falling. The sun doesn’t set till about 8pm. Mel’s accustomed to the time here already, except Gerald and me. I suddenly get depressed. What are my parents doing now? We're 15 hours behind, so that means, everybody's awake in S'pore now. Church service is starting now, teens service soon…….my heart is so heavy now…….  Gerald gets cranky and I’m surprised. He was an angel on the plane and didn’t cry much. So we feed him the cough/cold medicine and he falls asleep. I struggle to shut my eyes ‘cos everytime I do so, I seem to get transported back to Singapore. I take the medicine for cold and start drifting to sleep.    Sunday 23 May   I don’t’ wake up till 1pm!!!!! That’s almost 12 hours worth of sleep!!!! Dar says GG slept at 1am and only woke at 9am this morning!!!!  It feels weird not waking up early and rushing to get to church on time. Going to miss that kind of routine very badly.   We decide to visit the Flea Market, but by the time I get up from bed, wash up and pack GG’s bag, the people have gathered their wares and gone home. So we h
