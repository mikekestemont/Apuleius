a poem written about a year ago during my "i'll just live in the woods" period...  Van Gogh’s Moon  tonight the hemlocks form my room my night-light looks like Van Gogh’s moon everything will be changing soon  could go just about anyplace but south and I don’t own the keys to anyone’s house.  but my night-light is a Van Gogh moon yeah everything will be changing soon.  there’s a bottle of fire here by my side and I’m steady burning down the last of my pride  but I feel the glow of a Van Gogh moon and everything will be changing soon.  sleep will be coming to these mountains soon me and this here Van Gogh moon hoping everything will be changing soon.   © pettit
more brain fertilizer...(also possibly categorized as intellectual shit)...coming your way. the purpose of which is to stimulate your dying mind into activity...any activity. i want you to think, and think, and think...then act. go do something.   i want you to feel, be inspired, get pissed, try, look closer, touch, meet yourself, find your path. tell me what you think, tell me i'm an idiot, fight back, jump on board, speak up...post your comments and begin a dialog...a conversation.   paddle your raft. look for a moment through different glasses...from a different angle. the truth is not contingent upon the viewer's point of view. stand somewhere different and find out if things look differently...if a path appears. it is quite possible that you just might look at the rock you are under from a different angle and find that there is a beautiful gem on the other side. turn it over and see.   today's quote comes from me...made it up myself...for myself mostly...but i'll share, because i am hoping that for you one of these times a spark will catch.

some women have it...fairy dust...a spirit full of concentrated sunshine...they rule any man they touch...and the men long to be touched by such a woman. i know one like that and one of these days i just might show her this poem.   She rounds the corner  ashine with gleam  leading the sun  by a string  and with a single smile  it seems  turns&nbsp;the autumn  back to spring.   &nbsp;© pettit
