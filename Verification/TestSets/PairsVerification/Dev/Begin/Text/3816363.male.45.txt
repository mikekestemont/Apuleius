Ardrossan North By election result Tory 340, SNP 326, New Lab 259, Ind 99, SSP 78, BNP 23 30% turnout. This was previously a Labour stronghold, since 1980.  I was disappointed in the SSP vote, I had expected double.  The seat however was closely fought and perhaps this has made people more cautious. We do know that we attract from equally from SNP and New Labour as well as folk who have never voted before. The fact that our candidate was not local was an issue, however this should be the last time we have to field someone from outwith the area. We have managed finally to establish a Branch for the 3 Towns.  One of our supporters stood outside the polling station all day handing out leaflets against the BNP, she won't join the SSP due to our policy on Independence. It rained all day Thursday and she got soaked, but I couldnt help but remember her parents, both active socialists now deceased, they would have been proud of her.  We came face to face with the BNP candidate at the Tenants meeting on Tuesday night. There was about 20 present, when the BNP candidate arrived I asked for, and was granted permission to address the meeting. I explained that the SSP candidate could not perticipate in the meeting due to the presence of the fascist BNP. I issued a prepared statement condemning the BNP, and challenged the other candidates present to join me outside where we would be available to speak to tenants.  Funding from the local council for the group is dependent on the group being apolitical, they had to invite all candidates or none, and felt unable to un invite the BNP. So we were outside the meeting and the BNP were able to address the tenants, reports from others in attendance revealed that the BNP candidate was unable to string more than several words together. He said often, "I dont agree with all the BNP policies, but...."  New Labour were devastated at losing the seat, they are used to weighing the vote locally, and the Tory, a jack glass follower, was delighted. A strange result at a strange time.  Had a superb visit from Reidski. Moli cooked a superb Lasagne and a superb chocolate torte, her talents know no bounds. (She forced me to write that) We enjoyed a superb bottle of Malt and a superb blether. Nostalgic and informative, I've a better idea of where Reidski is politically and caught up with other aspects of his life. It is nearly 20 years since he left town and it was really really good to see him. Superb.  Moli has been doing a good trade in cards, kids are good.
