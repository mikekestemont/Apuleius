I was talking to Mrs. Slidge, and she is having a difficult time trying to figure out why Bush appeals to so many people.  She points out that Kerry is engaged in a lot of activities that most people would normally find pretty cool -- snowboarding, hockey, electric guitar.  Bush, on the other hand, keeps falling off his mountain bike and apparently hasn't mastered the fine art of watching football and eating pretzels at the same time.  Yet, Kerry is the one criticized for being a weenie.  I think we all know who the  real  weenie is.
This is classic.  The Bush Administration today released its projections on GDP, saying that they expect real GDP to increase to 4.7% this year, and slowing to 3.7% in 2005.  This projection would normally make sense, as last quarters GDP was 4.5%.  Of course, the projection came out a few hours after they announced that  this  quarters GDP is 3.0%.  On top of that, they project that the deficit is a record $445 billion, an increase of $71 billion over last year's shortfall.  And they are spinning this as a positive!  According to the Bush Admin, the  original  projection was for a deficit of $521 billion!  So, although the deficit is the  worst it has ever been , they are proud of themselves because  it could have been worse !!  In his acceptance speech last night, John Kerry said:  "They say this is the best economy we've ever had. And they say that anyone who thinks otherwise is a pessimist. Well, here is our answer: There is nothing more pessimistic than saying America can't do better." This is  exactly  what he was referring to. The Bush Administration gives us a record deficit and then attempts to tell us that we can't do better.
The new campaign motto for President Bush is the extraordinarily weak "We're turning the corner.  There's no turning back."  Well, Mr. President, I know what's around that corner.  It's a pretty seedy part of town.  I, personally, would like to go back and get on the Interstate.
According to the  urlLink Associated Press , George Bush has a "narrow" lead over Kerry in the electoral votes.  My own tracking poll shows a quite different result, with Kerry leading Bush  229  to  196 .  Bush actually went down 5 points today due to ARG's poll of West Virginia, which is now too close to call.  Not sure what the AP is using to determine their vote total, but one thing is certain -- since I started my tracking poll over two weeks ago, Kerry has never been behind Bush in either the votes outside the margin of error, votes where one candidate led the other in the poll by over 10%, or votes where the margin of error was discarded altogether.  --UPDATE--   urlLink Zogby   just released their battleground state polls.  Kerry picks up 9 votes to give him  238 , and Bush loses 20 votes to drop to  176  (in polls where the results are outside the margin of error).   Bush lost his votes i
